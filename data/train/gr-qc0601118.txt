    "there have been numerous studies in the literature on generalisations of the usual einstein - hilbert action of general relativity to more complicated functions of the curvature ( see refs . in @xcite ) .",
    "the motivation for such studies comes from a variety of different sources ranging from attempts to include quantum effects in the gravitational action @xcite to the investigation of phenomena that are presently inadequately explained in the standard model , such as dark energy dark1,dark2 , and violations of the cosmic no hair theorem @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the behaviour of these modified theories of gravity in the high - curvature limit , where quantum corrections to general relativity are expected to become important and their influence on the occurrence of singularities and possible bounces of the universe at high curvatures can be studied @xcite .",
    "it is the investigation of these modified theories of gravity on approach to the initial cosmological singularity that concerns us here .",
    "previous studies have focussed on the behaviour of isotropic cosmologies but , as we know from the situation in general relativity , their behaviour can be misleading .",
    "anisotropies diverge faster than isotropic densities at high curvatures and will generally dominate the behaviour of the cosmology at early ( and in some cases even late ) times .",
    "the most important anisotropic solutions of general relativistic cosmologies are the vacuum kasner solutions @xcite and their fluid - filled counterparts that form type i of the bianchi classification of three - dimensional homogeneous spaces .",
    "these universes are geometrically special , in vacuum ( or perfect - fluid ) cases they are defined by just one ( or two ) free constant(s ) compared to the four ( eight ) that specify the most general spatially homogeneous vacuum ( or perfect fluid ) solutions .",
    "however , they have proved to provide an excellent dynamical description of the evolution of the most general models over finite time intervals .",
    "the chaotic vacuum mixmaster universe of bianchi type ix undergoes a infinite sequence of chaotic space - time oscillations on approach to its initial or final singularities which is well approximated by a sequence of different kasner epochs which form a poincar return mapping for the chaotic dynamical system bkl , misner , jb1 , jb2 , chern , rend .",
    "the way in which the kasner metric has played a central role in the elucidation of the existence and structure of anisotropic cosmological models and their singularities in general relativity makes it the obvious starting point for an extension of that understanding to cosmological solutions of higher - order gravity theories . in an earlier letter",
    "@xcite we have reported the discovery of a new class of exact kasner - like solutions for gravity theories derived from lagrangians that are an arbitrary power of the scalar curvature . in this paper we will generalise that study to a much wider class of higher - order lagrangian theories .",
    "we will determine the conditions for the existence of kasner solutions and find their exact forms .",
    "in some cases these solutions are required to be isotropic and correspond to exact friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) vacuum solutions with zero spatial curvature . by studying gravity theories",
    "whose lagrangians are derived from arbitrary powers of the curvature invariants we are able to find simple exact solutions .",
    "past studies have usually focussed on the addition of higher - order curvature terms to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian .",
    "this results in enormous algebraic complexity and exact solutions can not be found .",
    "the results presented here provide a tractable route into understanding the behaviours of anisotropic cosmological models in situations where the higher - order curvature corrections are expected to dominate .",
    "the solutions we present are vacuum solutions but we provide a simple analysis which determines when the introduction of perfect fluids with non - coming velocities has a negligible effect on the cosmological evolution at early times .",
    "we consider field equations derived from an arbitrary analytic function of the three possible linear and quadratic contractions of the riemann curvature tensor ; @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite . the weight - zero lagrangian density for such theories",
    "is @xmath3where @xmath4 is a constant and @xmath5 is an arbitrary function of the variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 defined as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we ignore the boundary terms , for a discussion of which see ref .",
    "the field equations derived from the variation of the corresponding action are @xcite @xmath12where a subscript @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 denotes differentiation with respect to that quantity .",
    "we will be looking for spatially homogeneous , vacuum solutions of bianchi type i , described by the line ",
    "element @xmath13where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants to be determined .",
    "for the special case @xmath17 these solutions correspond to spatially flat frw metrics , which will be found to exist for various higher - order theories both in vacuum ( where none exist in general relativity ) and in the presence of a perfect fluid",
    ".    we can determine the number of independently arbitrary functions of three space variables that will characterise the _ general _ vacuum solution of the field equations on a cauchy surface of constant time in these higher - order theories .",
    "the field equations are in general @xmath18 order in time ; so if we choose a synchronous reference system then we need 6 functions each for the symmetric @xmath19 tensors @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this gives 24 functions , but they may be reduced to 20 by using the 4 constraint equations , and finally again to 16 by using the 4 coordinate covariances .",
    "if a perfect fluid were included as a matter source the final number would rise to 20 due to the inclusion of the density and 3 non - comoving velocity components in the initial data count .",
    "we note that in general relativity the general vacuum solution is prescribed by 3 arbitrary functions of 3 space variables . in general relativity ,",
    "the kasner vacuum solution is prescribed by one free constant , as the three @xmath24 satisfy two algebraic constraints .",
    "for a realistic theory we should expect the dominant term of the analytic function @xmath5 to be of the einstein - hilbert form in the newtonian limit . however , there is no reason to expect such a term to dominate in the high curvature limit - in fact , this is the limit in which quantum corrections should become dominant .",
    "we therefore allow the dominant term in a power series expansion of @xmath5 to be of the form @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 on approach to the singularity , where @xmath28 is a constant .",
    "these three different cases will be investigated separately below .      in a previous work @xcite we found bianchi type i solutions to the theory defined by the choice @xmath30 .",
    "these solutions have a particularly simple form and they could be used to show that anisotropic universes in such theories do not exhibit an infinite sequence of mixmaster oscillations on approach to the initial singularity , if @xmath31 .",
    "we also include these solutions here for completeness .",
    "substituting @xmath30 into the field equations ( [ fequations ] ) together with the line - element ( [ kasner ] ) gives the two independent algebraic constraints , @xmath32 and @xmath33 where we have defined @xmath34    the constraint equations have two classes of solution .",
    "the first is given by @xmath35which is only solved by the isotropic solution @xmath36 .",
    "this is the zero - curvature isotropic vacuum universe found by bleyer and schmidt @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that these isotropic cosmologies are valid for all @xmath37 and correspond to expanding universes for @xmath38 or @xmath39 and to collapsing universes for @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the second class of solutions to ( [ xn1 ] ) is given by @xmath42this class of solutions represents a generalisation of the kasner metric of general relativity and was the basis of the study @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this class of solutions only exists for @xmath28 in the range @xmath43 and that the values of the constants @xmath44 must then lie within the ranges @xmath45where it has been assumed without loss of generality that @xmath46 .",
    "these ranges are shown on figure [ xn ] and can be read off by drawing a horizontal line of constant @xmath28 on the plot .",
    "the four points at which the horizontal line crosses the two closed curves gives the four boundary values for the allowed ranges of the constants @xmath24 .",
    "it can be seen that the points at which the curves cross the abscissa , which corresponds to @xmath47 , give the boundary values @xmath48 , in agreement with the kasner solution of general relativity . for @xmath49 these solutions",
    "correspond to expanding universes with a curvature singularity at @xmath50 .",
    "for @xmath51 the only solution is minkowski spacetime .",

    "the stability and observational consequences of cosmologies of this type were investigated in @xcite , where primordial nucleosynthesis and the microwave background were used to impose observational constraints on the admissible values of @xmath28 .",
    "substituting @xmath63 into the field equation ( fequations ) along with the metric ansatz ( [ kasner ] ) gives the two independent equations , @xmath64and @xmath65where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are defined as before .",

    "the second class of solutions is given by @xmath73this is just the kasner solution of general relativity , for which the values of the constants @xmath24 are constrained to lie within the ranges @xmath74 .",

    "we have identified above two generalisations of the kasner metric of general relativity which are solutions to the scale - invariant theories of gravity we are investigating .",
    "the first of these is a solution to the theory defined by @xmath116 and was the subject of investigation in @xcite ; the second is a new solution to the theory @xmath117 .",
    "these are the first exact anisotropic solutions to be found for higher - order gravity theories . in this section",
    "we will investigate some of the properties of these cosmologies .",
    "the behaviour of these solutions is of particular interest when considering the bianchi type viii or type ix ` mixmaster ' cosmologies .",
    "the field equations for these cosmologies can be cast into the form of the equations of motion of a particle moving inside an exponentially steep triangular potential well with open channels in the corners @xcite .",
    "the three steep - sided walls are created by the 3-curvature anisotropies . in the region where the potential is negligible ( far from the walls )",
    "the behaviour of the solutions approaches that of the kasner metric .",
    "as the exponentially steep potential wall is approached the universe ` particle ' is reflected and re - enters a kasner  like regime with the kasner indices @xmath24 systematically changed to some new values by the rule of reflection from the potential wall .",
    "in general relativistic cosmologies of bianchi types viii and ix this process is repeated an infinite number of times as the singularity is approached @xcite so long as matter obeys an equation of state with @xmath118 .",
    "after reflection from the potential wall the kasner index that was previously negative is permuted to a positive value and the lowest - valued positive kasner index is permuted to a negative value .",
    "this is repeated _ ad infinitum _ in the general relativistic cosmology as one of the kasner indices must be kept negative while the other two are positive . in the generalisations of the kasner metric presented above this is no longer the case ; for some solutions it is possible for all of the kasner indices to be positive .",
    "if the kasner indices are being permuted in a chaotic fashion for long enough then , eventually , they will end up in such a configuration .",
    "once this occurs the oscillations will end , as all spatial dimensions will be contracting , and the singularity will reached monotonically without further oscillation of the scale factors @xcite .    from figure [ xn ] it can be seen that for solution ( [ xnkasner ] ) all kasner indices can be made positive for values of @xmath119 , in the @xmath120 theories . similarly , from figure [ yn ] it can be seen that for the solution ( [ ynkasner ] ) , with @xmath121 or @xmath122 that all the kasner indices can be made positive , in the theory @xmath123 ( where the @xmath124 are defined as before ) .",
    "for both of these solutions , with these ranges of @xmath28 , there is therefore no infinite series of chaotic mixmaster oscillations as the singularity is approached .",
    "however , the solutions to both of these theories are still expected to exhibit an infinite number of chaotic oscillations if @xmath40 , as at least one of the kasner indices must be kept negative whilst another is kept positive .",
    "a separate detailed analysis is require to determine where there are differences between this behaviour and the chaotic oscillations found in general relativity .",
    "it now remains to show that the vacuum solutions found above are the asymptotic attractor solutions in the presence of non - comoving matter motions as @xmath125 .",
    "this analysis will follow closely that of bar06 and @xcite .",
    "we aim to show that the fluid stresses diverge more slowly than the vacuum terms as @xmath125 and so produce negligible metric perturbations to an anisotropic kasner universe .",
    "if this is the case , then the vacuum solutions above can indeed be considered as the asymptotic attractor solutions even in the presence of matter .",
    "matter will just be carried along by the expansion and behave like a test fluid .",
    "we now consider a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath92 where @xmath126 and non - zero 4-velocity components , @xmath127 normalised so that @xmath128 .",
    "the conservation equations @xmath129 on the metric background ( [ kasner ] ) can then be written in the form @xcite @xmath130neglecting spatial derivatives with respect to time derivatives these equations integrate to @xmath131the neglecting of spatial derivatives means that these equations are valid on scales larger than the particle horizon as in the velocity - dominated approximation ( although we have not so far restricted the fluid motions to be non - relativistic ) @xcite .    from the second of the integrals",
    "above , it can be seen that all the covariant components of the spatial 3-velocity , @xmath132 , are approximately equal .",
    "this is not true of the contravariant components as the kasner indices , @xmath24 , in the metric elements used to raise indices are not equal in these solutions .",
    "the contravariant component that diverges the fastest , and dominates the others in the @xmath125 limit , is therefore @xmath133 , as @xmath16 is the largest of the @xmath24 .",
    "if the 4-velocity is normalised , so that @xmath134 , and the contravariant 3-velocity component @xmath135 diverges the fastest as @xmath136 then we must have @xmath137 in that limit .",
    "the integrated conservation equations above can now be solved approximately in this limit to give @xmath138as @xmath125 .",
    "it is now possible to calculate the leading - order contributions to the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath139 , as being @xmath140the component which diverges the fastest here as @xmath125 is @xmath141 , for general @xmath53 . for",

    "the vacuum terms diverge as @xmath146 .",
    "we therefore require that @xmath147 , or @xmath148 , in order for the vacuum terms to dominate over the matter terms for a non - comoving perfect fluid , with general @xmath53 , in the limit @xmath125 . for the @xmath149 comoving perfect fluid ( @xmath150 )",
    ", the condition for vacuum domination is @xmath151 , or @xmath152 .",
    "both of these conditions are ensured by the boundary values on @xmath16 given above . in the velocity - dominated limit ,",
    "the vacuum solutions given here are therefore the appropriate asymptotic solutions on approach to the singularity , as was found in @xcite .    for the generalised kasner metric in the @xmath117 theory , ( [ ynkasner ] ) ,",
    "the vacuum terms diverge as @xmath153 . for vacuum domination as @xmath125 in this solution",
    "we therefore require @xmath154 , or @xmath155 , for the general non - comoving @xmath53 fluid ; and @xmath156 , or @xmath157 , for the @xmath158 comoving fluid . from figure [ yn ]",
    "it can be seen that solutions of this class can be in one of two regions , @xmath159 or @xmath160 . the validity of the vacuum solution as @xmath161 is different in these two different regions .",
    "for the region @xmath160 the boundary conditions on the index @xmath16 mean that the conditions above are automatically satisfied .",
    "for the region @xmath83 these inequalities are not always satisfied .",
    "for general @xmath162 the condition for vacuum domination is only met if @xmath28 lies in the narrow range @xmath163 , for any other value of @xmath28 , in this region , the index @xmath16 can be such that the fluid diverges faster than the vacuum terms .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath158 comoving fluid the condition for vacuum domination is only satisfied if @xmath28 lies in the narrow range @xmath164 , where @xmath165 is the real root of the cubic    @xmath166    to understand the evolution of an anisotropic solution of the form ( kasner ) in the theory @xmath117 , where @xmath83 , it is therefore necessary to take into account the relativistic motions of any fluid that is present ( except in the narrow ranges of @xmath28 identified above ) .",
    "this range of @xmath28 can , however , be regarded as not belonging to physically interesting theories on other grounds . in order to agree with weak - field experiments",
    "it is necessary for a gravitational theory to contain a term which approximates the einstein - hilbert action in the weak - field limit ( see ref .",
    "any theory containing such a limit must therefore have a term in its lagrangian that diverges as @xmath167 . in considering the behaviour of alternative theories close to the singularity it is necessary for the extra terms in the lagrangian to diverge faster than this if they are to be influential as @xmath161 .",
    "for the theory @xmath117 this requires @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath38 such a term will diverge slower than the einstein - hilbert term which will then dominate and display the standard kasner behaviour of general relativity . for the anisotropic solution ( ynkasner )",

    "for the solution ( [ xnkasner ] ) to the theory @xmath177 it can be seen from the condition ( [ stiff ] ) that it is necessary for @xmath178 in order for the velocity - dominated approximation to break down ( this is derived using the upper limit on @xmath28 and the lower limit on @xmath179 ) .",
    "the condition that the fluid stresses diverge more slowly than the vacuum terms is now @xmath180 where it has been assumed @xmath49 .",
