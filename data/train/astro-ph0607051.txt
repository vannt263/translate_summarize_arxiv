    "it has been recognized that weak interaction processes in neutron star matter contribute to the bulk viscosity(sawyer & soui@xcite ; sawyer @xcite ; haensel & schaeffer @xcite ) . when only nucleons and leptons exist in the interior of neutron stars , the bulk viscosity results from urca processes .",
    "some exotic particles , such as hyperons and quarks , can be produced as the density inside neutron stars increases ( weber @xcite ; glendenning et al .",
    "the non - leptonic processes involving both hyperons and quarks lead to larger coefficient of bulk viscosity of dense nuclear matter(jones @xcite ; wang & lu @xcite ) . therefore ,",
    "the calculations of the bulk viscosity induced by non - leptonic reactions have received considerable attention in the past few years(sawyer @xcite ; madsen @xcite ; goyal et al .",
    "@xcite ; haensel & levenfish @xcite ; haensel et al .",
    "@xcite;lindblom & owen @xcite ; zheng et al.@xcite ; zheng et al.@xcite ; zheng et al.@xcite)since the discovery by andersson , friedman and morsink of r - mode instability in neutron stars(andersson @xcite ; friedman & morsink @xcite ) .",
    "actually , neutron stars can be constituted by a larger variety of particles other than just neutrons and protons or pure quark matter .",
    "the mixed phases , with nucleon - hyperon , nucleon - quark or nucleon - hyperon - quark matter , may be contained in the interior of neutron stars(glendenning @xcite ; glendenning @xcite ) .",
    "the bulk viscosities of mixed nucleon - hyperon matter and nucleon - quark matter have been discussed by some authors so far(lindblom & owen @xcite ; drago et al .",
    "@xcite ; nayyar & owen @xcite ) .",
    "however , the calculations are reduced to single reaction case since only one type of reaction is involved , either hadron or quark non - leptonic process .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the general case thoroughly .",
    "we focus on mixed nucleon - hyperon - quark matter to evaluate its bulk viscosity by considering the reactions involving both hyperons and quarks . according to lindblom & owen ( lo ) formalism ( lindblom & owen @xcite ; nayyar & owen @xcite ) , the bulk viscosity depends on the relaxation time governed by the hyperon and quark reactions . following the lo approach",
    ", we first convert reaction rates for hyperons and quarks into the production rate of neutrons per unit volume in order to give the relaxation time of the system , and then simulate the bulk viscosity of the mixed phase using the rates . in our study ,",
    "the conversion rate from quarks to neutrons varies with a variable baryon number density , and we will see below that the numerical solution is necessary .",
    "our study is under the neutron stars models based on @xmath2 @xmath3 equations of state(ghosh et al.@xcite ) ( eos ) for hadron matter and @xmath4 model ( schertler , greiner & thoma @xcite ) for quark matter in medium . at the high density ,",
    "@xmath5 eoss are favorable for the equilibrium state to include a sequence of hyperons .",
    "our model also concerns a @xmath6 @xmath7(baym et al.@xcite ) crust .",
    "our analysis shows that there exist two instability windows for a neutron star with strangeness .",
    "the low - temperature window indicates the possibility of existence of submillisecond pulsars .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide details of structures in stars which we are studying by taking into account a first - order deconfinement phase transition into quarks from hadrons in the cores of the stars .",
    "then in section 3,we employ lo approach to derive the bulk viscosity of mixed nucleon - hyperon - quark matter , including numerical aspects of the evaluations of the viscosity coefficient .",
    "finally in section 4 , we work out r - mode instability window based on the competition between increasing of gravitational radiation and damping of viscosities .",
    "in this paper , we consider the compact stars inside which the deconfinement transition occurs at high density . concerning the hadronic phase ( hp ) , we use the @xmath8 eos at subnuclear densities for the crust of the star , and the @xmath5 eos for supranuclear density in the framework of the relativistic self - consistent mean field theory ( glendenning @xcite ) .",
    "in this theory , @xmath9 and @xmath10 hyperons are included for nuclear densities , where nucleons interact through the nuclear force mediated by the exchange of isoscalar and isovector mesons @xmath11 .",
    "the model parameters used in this paper are arranged in table 1 .",
    "these two eoss are matched at @xmath12 , here @xmath13 is the saturation density of nucleon , above which we allow the hp to undergo a first order phase transition to a deconfined quark matter phase ( qp ) that is described with the effective mass bag model considering medium effect represent by the coupling constant @xmath14 for strong action ( schertler , greiner & thoma @xcite ) .",
    "this phase transition makes it possible that the occurrence of a mixed hadron - quark phase ( mp ) in a finite density range inside compact stars .",
    "the relative constraints of various species in the mp are determined at each density by imposing @xmath15-equilibrium , gibbs condition and global charge neutrality . at the high density of interest to us , these equilibrium constraints are @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    here @xmath25 are the chemical potential and the number density of the @xmath26 species respectively , @xmath27 is the pressure of the @xmath26 phase , and @xmath28 is the fraction of the quark matter in mp . solving these constraints , we can give the compositions of the equilibrium matter in hybrid stars .",
    "figure [ gps fixed population ] and [ g fixed population ] show some solutions for different parameters .",
    "evidently , they contain a significant number of hyperons and strange quark matter in the highest density portion of their cores , and the additional hyperons appear as the coupling among quarks increases . using the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation ,",
    "we obtain the structures of some hybrid stars with maximum masses for a few eoss shown in figure [ structure ] , where we also plot the structures of hyperon stars for the same @xmath5 eoss ( figure [ structure](c ) ) as comparison .",
    "the eoss of the stars are softened when deconfinement phase transition happens , but the structures of the stars are not sensitive to the changes of @xmath5 eoss unlike hyperon stars , while medium effect in quark matter does significantly change the stellar masses and radii . as is known",
    ", the hulse - taylor pulsar has the measured mass of 1.44 @xmath29 ( taylor & weisberg @xcite ) . strictly speaking",
    ", the eoss models producing the maximum mass smaller than the measured value should be rejected .",
    "we , however , take the lower values around 1.44 @xmath29 to compare with @xmath5 models ( hyperon stars ) , since the small difference of the masses ca nt change our results significantly below .",
    "bulk viscosity is the dissipative process in which the macroscopic compression or expansion of a fluid element is converted to heat(landau & lifshitz @xcite ) .",
    "the dissipation due to bulk viscosity is carried out via microscopic reactions which come from weak interactions in compact star matter . in general",
    ", there are two types of reactions in dense nuclear matter .",
    "one produces bulk viscosity because its timescales are comparable with the period of the perturbation , the other puts constraints on the variations of different particles densities . as in most cases , the volume per unit mass variation and the chemical potential imbalance due to the oscillation in the star are so small that it is the linear part that contributes most to the viscosity , so we will use the relaxation time approximation method(lindblom & owen @xcite ; drago et al.@xcite ; landau & lifshitz @xcite ) to compute the bulk viscosity of dense nuclear matter .    here",
    "we are interested in the case that hyperons and quarks are all present in the mixed phase .",
    "it is thought that the non - leptonic processes are dominating over the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter with strangeness ( jones @xcite ; lindblom & owen @xcite ; drago et al.@xcite ) . in the initial works(drago et al.@xcite )",
    ", one estimated the results arising from a single reaction , assuming either an absence of hyperon or quark pairing in mixed hadron - quark phase . that treatment was for simplification in the calculations .",
    "in fact , the processes that produce bulk viscosity of the mixed system are @xmath30 for strange quark matter , and @xmath31 @xmath32 for hyperon matter .    accordingly , the processes which put constraints on the variations of the densities of different particles come from the melting reactions of nucleons @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 and hyperons @xmath36 into free quarks .    in the mixed phase , since the degrees of freedom , for example , the number densities of various baryons , are related to each other even out of thermodynamic equilibrium by constraints such as conservation of baryon number",
    ", we could express all of the perturbed quantities in terms of a single one .",
    "we here choose the number density of neutrons @xmath37 as our primary variable . since the three reactions ( [ en21])([en220])([en22 ] ) all contribute to the change of neutron numbers , we express the production rate of neutrons per unit volume as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 indicate the reaction rates of processes ( [ en21 ] ) , ( [ en220 ] ) and ( [ en22 ] ) respectively , and @xmath1 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the rates converting reaction rates of each exotic particles , s quark , @xmath10 and @xmath9 hyperon , into the production rate of neutrons .",
    "for fast processes , we know that their contributions to the relaxation time of the system could be omitted compared with the slow processes , so we may easily know that @xmath44 and @xmath45 by the reactions ( [ en220 ] ) and ( [ en22 ] ) .",
    "the determination of @xmath1 is a slightly complicated matter .",
    "its treatment will be given later .",
    "obviously , if the system is perturbed , the fraction of the quark matter in the mixed phase @xmath28 would be changed through reactions ( [ en23 ] ) , ( [ en24 ] ) and ( [ en25 ] ) , and the pressure of the system would be equilibrated again after the perturbation in order to satisfy the mechanical equilibrium .",
    "therefore we have following constraints :    @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    the first constraint ( [ en26 ] ) is the baryon number conservation of the system .",
    "the second one ( [ en27 ] ) imposes the conservation of electric charge assuming all leptonic reaction rates are much smaller and neglected . the third constraint ( [ en28 ] )",
    "is related to the mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the last four ( [ en29])-([en31 ] ) describe the equilibrium with respect to reactions ( [ en23])-([en25 ] ) .",
    "noteworthily , when the @xmath9 density vanishes in the system , @xmath53 , and the melting process ( [ en240 ] ) does nt exist , nor does the process ( [ en220 ] ) .    here",
    "we use @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 for shortening .",
    "then we could obtain the variations of various particles number densities @xmath57 and the quark fraction @xmath58 in the form of @xmath59 .    in order to determine @xmath1",
    ", we need to describe the variation of neutrons @xmath59 following ( [ en160000 ] ) as    @xmath60    thus we have @xmath61 which is a function of baryon number density for given equation of state under thermodynamic equilibrium in the mixed phase system . combining the constraints conditions to equation ( [ en1600000 ] ) with the linear dependence of @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 on @xmath59",
    ", the @xmath1 can be determined .",
    "an example of the numerical result is showed in the figure [ ks coefficient ] . in the extreme ,",
    "if the system does nt undergo the deconfinement phase transition ( @xmath65 ) or is in the absence of hyperons ( @xmath66 ) , the calculation is reduced to the situation of a single reaction(lindblom & owen @xcite ; drago et al.@xcite ) .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath67 of the system due to these reactions must be : @xmath68 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 have already been calculated by @xmath69 under the high temperature limit @xmath70 ( dai & lu @xcite ) and @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 ( lindblom & owen @xcite ; nayyar & owen @xcite ) separately . considering the reactions ( [ en23])([en24])([en240])([en25 ] ) , the overall chemical potential imbalance @xmath74 is obtained through the equilibrium of the system : @xmath75 which could also be described in the form of @xmath59 .",
    "now we use the lo formula @xmath76 to evaluate the bulk viscosity .",
    "thereinto , @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the relative population of neutrons in the equilibrium state of the mixed phase calculated in the part 2 .",
    "@xmath79 is the perturbation frequency in compact stars , which is typically @xmath80 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath81 for calculation . by the equation ( [ en16000 ] ) , we know that for a perturbation of fixed frequency , the bulk viscosity @xmath82 is in proportion to the reciprocal of the relaxation time @xmath67 under the low temperature limit @xmath83 , that is @xmath84 ; on the other hand @xmath82 is in proportion to @xmath67 under condition of the high temperature limit @xmath85 , that is @xmath86 .",
    "thereby , @xmath87 could be divided into two different behaviors , in another word , @xmath87 will increase with the temperature for low temperature regime ; and the circs is just opposite for the high temperature regime .",
    "the transition temperature is the function of baryon density and perturbation frequency ( figure [ trantemperature ] for @xmath88 eos ) .",
    "figure [ gps fixed bulk viscosity ] and figure [ g fixed bulk viscosity ] display the bulk viscosity of mixed phase as a function of baryon density for various temperatures and given eoss .",
    "the numerical results show that i ) the bulk viscosity of mixed phase , either nucleon - hyperon phase or nucleon - quark phase or nucleon - hyperon - quark phase , is of almost the same order of the bulk viscosity of pure strange quark matter , ii ) the differences between eoss only change the compositions and sizes of the mixed phase in the interior of the stars , iii ) the transition temperature between low and high temperature regime is about @xmath89 in our models .",
    "the r - modes in a perfect fluid star succumbing to gravitational radiation ( gr ) drive the chandrasekhar - friedman - schutz instability for all rates of stellar rotation , and arise due to the action of coriolis force with positive feedback of the increasing of gr(andersson & kokkotas @xcite ; stergioulas @xcite ) .",
    "actually , the viscosity of stellar matter can hold back the growth of the modes effectively . based on the competition between the destabilizing effect of gr and the damping effect of viscosity , a r - mode instability window can be defined .",
    "now , we could apply our results of the bulk viscosity in the previous section together with those of the hp and qp to considering the r - mode instability windows of rotating compact stars using the standard formulae given in literatures(lindblom et al.@xcite ; lindblom et al.@xcite ) .",
    "we first integrate the viscosity on the structure of stars , which has been showed in figure [ structure ] for a wide range of eoss , to obtain the bulk viscosity timescale @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 @xmath93 here @xmath94 is the mode energy in a frame rotating with the star , @xmath95 is the rate at which energy is drained from the mode by viscosity , @xmath96 is a dimensionless amplitude coefficient , @xmath97 is the angular frequency of a spinning star , @xmath98 is the energy density of star at radius r , and @xmath99 is the eulerian velocity perturbation . in general the expansion of the mode",
    "@xmath100 is a complicated function of radius and angle .",
    "although the function can only been determined numerically , we adopt an excellent analytical fit to those numerical solutions @xmath101(\\frac{\\omega^{2}}{\\pi g\\bar{\\epsilon}})^{2}},\\ ] ] which is given by lindblom ( lindblom & owen @xcite ; nayyar & owen @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we could obtain the critical rotation frequency for the star with a solid crust as a function of temperature following from @xmath102 for low temperature limit(@xmath103 ) , and @xmath104 for high temperature limit(@xmath105 ) . here",
    "@xmath106 is the timescale for gravitational radiation to effect the r - mode(andersson & kokkotas @xcite ) , while @xmath107 is the timescale for surface rubbing due to the presence of the viscous boundary layer if a solid crust exists(bildsten & ushomirsky @xcite ; andersson et al.@xcite ) , and @xmath108 is the viscosity timescale of modified urca reactions for low density hadronic matter(lindblom et al.@xcite ) .",
    "our results for the critical rotation frequency are shown in the figure [ rmode ] .",
    "we may know from it that there are two instability windows for such hybrid stars(andersson & kokkotas @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the r - mode instability is completely suppressed for the hybrid stars from the low temperature windows .",
    "we realize that hadronic eoss , either stiffer of softer , hardly influence the instability windows .",
    "it is because that the structure of the star including quark phase hardly changes for different @xmath5 eoss .",
    "the increasing medium effect of quarks enlarges the window at low @xmath14 values but reduces the window at high @xmath14 values .",
    "the properties may imply that extremely rapid rotating or submillisecond pulsars would exist , and just be the hybrid stars .",
    "hyperons and quarks exist in cores of neutron stars at high density .",
    "to evaluate accurately the bulk viscosity ( due to strangeness - changing four - baryon weak interactions involving both hyperons and quarks non - leptonic processes ) , it is necessary to compute detailed and accurate models for the compositions and structures of the neutron - star cores .",
    "we use @xmath5 eoss for hadrons and @xmath4 model with medium effect for quarks to evaluate composition of the nuclear matter inside the stellar core and solve the tov equation to obtain the stellar structure , and particularly study the effect of differences between eoss on the structures of stars .",
    "we numerically calculate the bulk viscosity of mixed phase matter of various eoss , and especially give the treatment of the case that involves both hyperons and quarks reactions .",
    "it is a generalization of single reaction case in previous work ( drago et al.@xcite ) .",
    "our results show that there is high coefficient of bulk viscosity as long as exotic particle appears in high density nuclear matter , either strange quark or hyperon .",
    "we have considered medium effect of quark matter .",
    "the bulk viscosity of hybrid star increases as the coupling among quarks becomes stronger .",
    "the coefficient of bulk viscosity at large coupling constant is higher than assumed in reference ( drago et al.@xcite ) , and the mixed phase regime is expanded .",
    "just so , the hybrid stars have extremely high limiting rotation frequencies from the low temperature windows even if the stellar masses are large .",
    "the submillisecond pulsars may exist .",
    "we must emphasize that we are concerned about the bulk viscosity of mixed normal nucleon - hyperon - quark phase .",
    "nucleon , hyperon superfluidity and quark superconductivity may occur at @xmath109 and given critical density .",
    "these effects would significantly influence the dissipation of hybrid star matter .",
    "these considerations , which are made in hyperon star model ( lindblom & owen @xcite ) and hybrid star model ( drago et al.@xcite ) , are our future work .",
