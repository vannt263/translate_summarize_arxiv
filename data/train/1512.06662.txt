    "given a triple @xmath68 the corresponding character on @xmath38 is given by @xmath69 and since @xmath70 for elements of @xmath38 two such triples yield the same character precisely when they are projectively equivalent .",

    "the right - hand - side of the assembly map for @xmath57 is the @xmath16-theory of @xmath101 .",
    "the preceding discussion allows us to identify this as @xmath102 .",
    "hence the right - hand - side is closely related to the action of the group @xmath7 on the plane @xmath2 , indeed the group @xmath34-algebra is morita equivalent to @xmath103 . given that the left - hand - side is determined by the action of a different group ( @xmath57 ) on @xmath2 the appearance of @xmath7 in our description of the right - hand - side is unexpected .",
    "this illustrates and is explained by theorem [ the main theorem ] .",
    "we will now proceed to compute explicitly the right - hand side of the assembly map for the triangle group .",

    "this induces a restriction map @xmath133 from @xmath134 to @xmath135 and",
    "since the action of @xmath6 on @xmath106 covers @xmath98 ( indeed it covers the whole of @xmath59 ) this restriction map is injective .",
    "we note that the image of @xmath106 in the torus @xmath132 is preserved by the cyclic subgroup @xmath100 of @xmath6 generated by @xmath136 ( cf .",

    "this action lifts to an action of @xmath100 on @xmath106 and elements of the image of @xmath133 are @xmath100-invariant , where @xmath100 acts diagonally on the tensor product @xmath135 .",
    "moreover for a point on the boundary of @xmath106 the image in @xmath132 is invariant under one or more of the reflections @xmath137 and hence the value of the function at that point is also invariant under that reflection .",
    "in particular at a vertex of @xmath106 the value is a @xmath6-invariant operator on @xmath138 .",
    "this combined with the @xmath100 invariance implies automatically that the values at the three vertices agree , which indeed they must as the three vertices map to a single point in the torus .",

    "since this operator is homotopic to the identity the quotient algebra is isomorphic to @xmath154 and hence has the @xmath16-theory of a circle , i.e. @xmath155 .",
