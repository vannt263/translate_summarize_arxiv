    "in a simple universe governed only by gravity , the bremsstrahlung luminosity of galaxy clusters would scale as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gas temperature ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "however , the observed relation is steeper , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ( e.g. arnoud & evrard 1999 ; helsdon & ponman 2000 ) .",
    "other relations , notably the one between entropy and temperature , also show deviation from self - similarity ( lloyd - davies , ponman , & cannon 2000 ; mohr , mathiesen , & evrard 1999 ) .",
    "these discrepancies can be explained if gas in clusters experienced some non - gravitational heating before ( or when ) it flowed into the cluster halo ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) . however , there is no general consensus about the details of the heating process .",
    "here we compare two pictures for the heating that have been proposed by a number of authors in recent years : the _ external heating _ scenario , in which the gas is heated at high redshifts , before it enters massive halos , and the _ internal heating _ scenario , in which the energy is injected when some or most of the gas is already inside a massive halo . in this latter case",
    "we assume that the sources of energy are snii explosions .",
    "the motivation for considering snii heating a viable form of heating is the success of our models in reproducing the evolution of ism in ngc 4472 ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ) .",
    "ngc 4472 is a giant elliptical at the center of a subcluster in virgo , consistent with being the remnant of a galaxy group , probably stripped of the outer regions when it entered the virgo cluster .",
    "we showed that snii heating was able to reproduce the gas density and temperature profiles ( and therefore also the entropy profile ) .",
    "we use a modified version of the hydrocode zeus ( stone & norman 1992 ) and we assume spherical symmetry .",
    "the code follows two fluids : a normal , collisional gas , and a collisionless fluid which represents the dark matter .",
    "our groups and clusters evolve from a single top - hat perturbation in a @xmath6cdm universe ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the dark matter accumulates in a navarro , frenk , & white ( 1996 ) halo by design .",
    "we consider a set of three objects with different virial masses ( at the present time ) :    - @xmath11 m@xmath12 : `` the group '' ;    - @xmath13 m@xmath12 : `` the poor cluster '' ;    - @xmath14 m@xmath12 : `` the rich cluster '' ;    we focus here mainly on groups , since lower mass system are more sensitive to heating , and our models , by ignoring the complex merging events , are anyway less appropriate to describe the formation and evolution of large clusters .    _ _ .",
    "we assume an extreme form of preheating : at very high redshift , @xmath15 , we reset everywhere the gas density to the mean baryon density , @xmath16 . at that epoch , the temperature is raised to some constant level @xmath17 .",
    "we consider 4 levels of heating : @xmath18 k , corresponding to @xmath19 kev / particle .",
    "these amount of heating is characterized by the numbers @xmath20 to @xmath21 respectively , in our nomenclature .",
    "the entropy parameter @xmath22 corresponding to these levels of heating , which depends on the heating epoch @xmath23 through @xmath24 , is @xmath25 kev @xmath26 .",
    "gas is allowed to cool and to dropout of the flow .",
    "this last process is modeled in the usual way ( e.g. sarazin & ashe 1989 ) adding a sink term in the continuity equation @xmath27 with @xmath28 .    _ _ . in this series of models",
    ", heating is assumed to be the result of star formation occurring inside the group or cluster .",
    "thus , we need to assume a schematic scenario for star formation in these systems . at @xmath29 ( 2 gyr after the big - bang )",
    "we form stars from cooled gas ( conserving baryons ) and release snii energy inside the accretion shock radius @xmath30 .",
    "all the gas inside @xmath31 is assumed to get the same amount of energy per unit mass . te total amount of energy released",
    "is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the number of snii per unit solar mass predicted by a stellar population with a salpeter imf , @xmath34 erg is the kinetic energy released by a single snii and @xmath35 is the total mass of stars .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 controls the amount of heating ( i.e. the number of snii ) .",
    "we consider 4 models with @xmath37 , labeled with numbers 1 to 4 , in analogy with the external heating models .    in more familiar units ,",
    "snii inject @xmath38 kev / particle to the gas inside @xmath31 at @xmath23 .",
    "this is consistent with the global value @xmath39 kev / particle which is derived assuming a global star formation efficiency @xmath40 ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) and assuming that the snii energy is shared among all the baryons . in our models , instead , snii heat only the central part of clusters , similar to the models proposed by loewenstein ( 2000 ) . in these models",
    "the hydrodynamic equations are modified to take into account the mass and energy injected by stars and snia of the central , dominant galaxy .",
    "full details about the simulations can be found in brighenti & mathews ( 2001 ) .",
    "after evolving to the current time , @xmath41 gyrs , the location of our models can be compared with observed clusters in the @xmath0 plot as shown in fig .",
    "1 . in general",
    ", heating has a little effect on the emission weighted temperature ( heated clusters are not hotter ! ) .",
    "paradoxically , models with maximum heating are always the coolest .",
    "instead , the luminosity generally decreases as heating increases , a result of the lower mean gas density .",
    "groups , having lower virial temperatures , are more affected by the heating , while rich clusters are quite insensitive to it .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the results for the _ external heating _ scenario .",
    "models `` 1 '' without heating nicely follow the self - similar prediction @xmath2 .",
    "the group model with maximum heating ( model `` 4 '' ) lies among the observed groups , and the series of models `` 4 '' follows a relation @xmath4 , similar to the observed one .",
    "however , it requires that @xmath42 kev / particle are dumped in the gas , or that a entropy floor @xmath43 kev @xmath44 is established at @xmath15 .",
    "the energy budget needed is a function of @xmath23 . if @xmath45 , @xmath46 kev / particle is sufficient to decrease the luminosity of groups to the observed level .",
    "the _ internal heating _ models are less sensitive to the amount of energy injected ( right panel of fig",
    ". 1 ) and they tend to lie near the upper envelope of the observed @xmath0 data , where strong cooling flows are dominated by a massive central galaxy as we have assumed .",
    "groups models with @xmath47 have x - ray properties consistent with observed groups , provided the efficiency of snii heating is high ( we assumed efficiency @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , it is likely that a significant fraction of the snii energy is lost by radiation , and a more realistic constraint may be @xmath49 .",
    "the behavior of entropy for _ external heating _ models is illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . in the left panel",
    "we compare the entropy evaluated at @xmath51 with the data of lloyd - davies et al .",
    "the series with maximum heating ( models `` 4 '' , indicated with the largest circles ) , which fits best in the @xmath0 plot , has a much larger entropy than observed groups and poor clusters .",
    "models `` 3 '' ( which requires @xmath52 kev / particle ) may be the best compromise",
    ".    the difficulty for external heating models to simultaneously fit the @xmath0 and @xmath50 relations is also illustrated by the radial entropy profiles ( right panel of fig .",
    "the computed group entropy profiles are compared with the observed profile of ngc 2563 group ( dot - dashed line ; trinchieri , fabbiano , & kim 1997 ) ; see also the profiles in lloyd - davies et al .",
    "real groups have entropy profiles that increase monotonically with radius , while for model `` 4 '' @xmath53 is uniform and model `` 3 '' shows a flat entropy core for @xmath54 kpc .",
    "this behavior is due to the inefficiency of radiative cooling in the low density cores of these strongly heated groups .    _",
    "internal heating _ group models fall nicely among the observations in the @xmath50 plane ( fig .",
    "3 ) , regardless of the heating parameter @xmath36 .",
    "strong radiative cooling regulates the entropy in the central regions to have similar values for all adopted @xmath36 .",
    "radial entropy profiles are also consistent with observations ( fig .",
    "3 , bottom panel ) , although our models are somewhat denser overall with slightly lower @xmath55 .",
    "models experiencing external preheating at very early times differ from those heated internally by snii in several other respects .",
    "notably , it appears that internal heating removes baryons more efficiently than preheating at @xmath15 .",
    "we find for preheated groups that the baryon fraction at @xmath56 kpc is @xmath57 for model `` 3 '' , almost equal to the cosmic baryon fraction assumed , @xmath58 . only for the maximally preheated model `` 4 '' ,",
    "is the baryon fraction significantly lower than the cosmic one : @xmath59 .",
    "groups heated internally by snii have low baryon fraction even when a salpeter imf is assumed ( @xmath60 ) : @xmath61 ( @xmath62 for @xmath63 ) .",
    "the fraction of mass in gas at @xmath64 is @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath60 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "a further distinction between external and internal heating models is the central cooling time which , if lower than the age of the system , may indicate the presence of a cooling flow .",
    "we find that models with preheating strong enough to fit observations in the @xmath0 plot ( models 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "1 ) never develop cooling flows ( or , more precisely , never have @xmath67 ) , contrary to many observed groups and clusters .",
    "all internal heating models , instead , develop strong cooling flows .",
    "in particular , group models have @xmath68 m@xmath12 yr@xmath69 .",
    "both the external and internal heating scenarios seem to require more energy than that provided , via snii , by the observed stellar content with a salpeter imf .",
    "a reasonable requirement may be @xmath46 kev / particle ( a value consistent with most models proposed in recent years ) .",
    "snii also produce metals , so we should ask : is the number of snii needed to heat the gas consistent with the number of snii necessary to produce the metal content of the universe ?    a salpeter imf ( from 0.1 to 100 m@xmath12 ) produces @xmath70 snii per m@xmath12 of stars formed . assuming a global star formation efficiency @xmath71 ( fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) , we get @xmath72 kev / particle . thus , to generate @xmath46 kev / particle we need @xmath73 .",
    "the present day universe has a global iron abundance @xmath74 solar meteoritic units ( renzini 1997 ) .",
    "assuming again @xmath71 with an average fe yield per snii @xmath75 m@xmath12 ( e.g. gibson , loewenstein , & mushotzky 1997 ) , the averaged metallicity produced by all snii is @xmath76 solar . to make the observed metallicity ,",
    "a high snii production efficiency is needed : @xmath77 ( this value would be reduced somewhat if snia contribute a significant fraction of iron ) .",
    "thus , it appear that both heating and cosmic metallicity may be produced by a stellar population with @xmath78 .",
    "the agreement between these two estimates of @xmath36 supports snii as the source of non gravitational heating .",
    "however , it should be noted that such a large production of snii may be inconsistent with the chemical evolution of ism in elliptical galaxies ( brighenti & mathews 1999b ) .",
    "_ external heating _ models fit the data in the @xmath0 plot provided the preheating is sufficiently strong : @xmath79 kev / particle , depending on @xmath23",
    ". however , successful models in the @xmath0 plane have entropies that exceed observed values ( a cautionary note : we are well aware that our models are approximate , and it s possible that less extreme preheating scenarios may overcome the problems pointed out by the present work ) . the competing models with _ internal heating _ by snii fit the whole set of x - ray observations better and more plausibly , but they likely require a production of energy per unit of stellar mass larger than that based on a salpeter imf .",
    "this may not be a severe demand since the cosmic metallicity itself requires such a higher number of snii per unit of stellar mass .",
