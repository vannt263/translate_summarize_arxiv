    "let @xmath880 be such a copy .",
    "note that only another copy of @xmath878 is allowed to be next to @xmath880 on either its left or its right edges .",
    "therefore , @xmath441 contains a copy of the set @xmath881 where @xmath576 is the isometry @xmath870 .",
    "so if @xmath882 is the `` top '' edge of @xmath880 then the set @xmath883 is a horocycle .",
    "so there is a horocycle contained in the edges of @xmath441 .",
    "if @xmath4 is the symmetry group of @xmath441 then the quotient space @xmath884 admits a tiling by @xmath885 ( the quotient tiling ) .",
    "so the horocycle @xmath681 must descend to a closed horocycle on @xmath884 .",
    "thus @xmath884 is noncompact . but",
    "any tile placed deep enough in a cusp necessarily has self - intersections .",

    "use the triangle @xmath857 to tile the complement of the union of horoballs .",
    "for @xmath384 , tile the first @xmath579 `` rows '' of each horoball with copies of @xmath878 .",
    "this can be done in such a way that the resulting partial tiling has symmetry group @xmath886 with finite index in @xmath887 .",

    "the set of partial tilings of @xmath101 by @xmath80 is topologized in a manner analogous to how @xmath850 is topologized . with this topology , it is compact and metrizable .",
