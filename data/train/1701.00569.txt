    "the dynamics of liquid confined in nano structures have attracted interests due to their potential applications in nanofluidics  @xcite .",
    "it has been considered that the navier - stokes(ns ) equation is still valid for the description of the fluid hydrodynamics even if the liquid is scaled down to a few molecular layers  @xcite . in order to solve the ns equation for the confined liquid , a proper boundary conditions(bc )",
    "should be applied at the solid - liquid interfaces .",
    "a commonly used bc is the no - slip bc , which requires that the fluid has zero velocity at the interfaces .",
    "such bc increases the hydrodynamic resistance to the fluid when the size of the confined liquid is decreased , which brings difficulties for the applications of the nanofluidics  @xcite . in order to overcome the difficulties ,",
    "the slippage of liquid at the solid surfaces has been introduced to decrease the hydrodynamic resistance  @xcite .",
    "the bc with the slippage of the liquid at the interfaces is known as the navier boundary condition ( nbc ) .",
    "the nbc requires that the velocity components of the liquid does not vanish at the interfaces in the moving direction . in order to quantify the slippage of liquid",
    ", a slip length @xmath0 has been introduced in the nbc  @xcite .",
    "generally , the no - slip bc can be recovered from the nbc by setting @xmath1 . and",
    ", larger the slip length @xmath0 , more slippery the liquid at the interfaces . since the slip length @xmath0 used in the nbc determines the solutions to the ns equation for the confined liquid , many authors have proposed various structures for the interfaces to enhance the slip length @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "but for the various structures , the fundamental structure is the roughness , which is the nature of the interfaces . for the interfaces with large roughness",
    ", one has to solve the ns equation by using mathematical tools such as the finite element method . and",
    "for the interfaces with small roughness , the rough interfaces can be treated as flat ones with the roughness involved in the slip length of the flat interfaces .",
    "so , for the latter , a question arises .",
    "what is the slip length @xmath0 of the interfaces with the roughness involved ? in this study , we will focus on the interfaces with small roughness and address the problem to get the @xmath0 relating to the roughness in a quantitative way .",
    "+ the slip length @xmath0 is defined as the ratio of the shear viscosity @xmath2 of liquid to the friction coefficient @xmath3 of the solid surface by @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath2 is position dependent in the liquid  @xcite . especially , the viscosity of liquid in the region close to the interfaces may be enhanced compared to the viscosity in the region away from the interfaces .",
    "the discrepancy of the viscosities in the two regions leads to the shift of the exact location of the bc applied away from the solid surfaces by a few molecular layers  @xcite .",
    "however , in this study , we consider that the fluid is newtonian and the @xmath2 is constant in the whole computational domain for simplicity , since we only focus on the effect of the roughness of the interfaces on the slip length @xmath0 . + the @xmath3 is used to show the resistance of the solid surfaces to the liquid .",
    "generally , two mechanisms are contributed to the @xmath3 .",
    "one mechanism is of the chemical interaction between the liquid molecules and the solid molecules at the solid - liquid interfaces , like that the attractive or repulsive force to aqueous liquids depends on whether the solid surfaces are hydrophobic or hydrophilic respectively .",
    "the other mechanism is due to the fine structures of the interfaces , such as the roughness of the interfaces .",
    "the collusions between the liquid molecules and the rough interfaces bring the friction force to the liquid .",
    "we denote the friction coefficient contributed from the chemical interaction by @xmath5 and the contribution of roughness of the interfaces by @xmath6 in the following . for an ideally flat interface",
    ", the chemical interaction contributes totally to the @xmath3 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , for a real interface , the roughness is inevitable and @xmath6 is nonzero . in such a real case ,",
    "the friction forces respecting the two mechanisms then are obtained by @xmath9 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 the fluid velocity at the interfaces in the moving direction .",
    "due to the additivity of the friction forces , we get the total friction coefficient as @xmath12 .",
    "+ the determination of friction force of the solid surfaces , hence the @xmath0 , for the confined liquid has been a long - standing question and has been heavily studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "experimental and theoretical results , as well as the molecular dynamics simulations , have been reported . in those studies , the roughness of the solid surfaces causing the no - slip",
    "bc has been pointed out and later confirmed by the molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite .",
    "however , the role of the interface roughness in the slip bc actually is still lack . a very interesting result",
    "basing on the linear response theory has been obtained , in which the structure factor of the liquid in the region close to the interfaces is involved in the @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , the structure factor does not have an explicit relation to the roughness of the interfaces in that study . in order to complete the understanding of the flow boundary conditions for confined liquid , it is necessary to bridge the slip length @xmath0 to the roughness of the solid surfaces , which is our goal in this study .",
    "we consider a model that simple liquid is confined by two parallel solid plates .",
    "we set the coordinate with the @xmath13 axis normal to the plates and the @xmath14 axis parallel to the moving direction of the liquid .",
    "the two plates both are infinitely long to get rid off the ending effects of the structure .",
    "the two solid - liquid interfaces are located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the upper and lower plates respectively .",
    "the friction force applied on the fluid is considered to be opposite to the moving direction of the @xmath14 axis , while the component of the friction force along the @xmath17 direction is averaged to be zero . for simplicity , we think the interfaces are flat along the @xmath17 direction , and then the roughness of the interfaces is the function of @xmath14 only .",
    "we use the function @xmath18 to describe the roughness of the upper interface and use @xmath19 for the lower one .",
    "the two roughness functions both are averaged to be zero over the interfaces at their locations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "the complete navier - stokes(ns ) equation for the fluid in the channel has the form of @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the fluid velocity and @xmath22 the liquid density .",
    "the @xmath22 and the @xmath2 have been assumed to be uniform for the liquid in the channel , since we focus on the effects from the solid surfaces only . in the right hand side of the eq.([nsequ ] ) , the first two terms represent the force of the gradient of pressure and the gravitational force respectively .",
    "the third term is for the convect and the final term is due to the compressibility of the fluid . in the eq .",
    "( [ nsequ ] ) , the equality of @xmath23 has been applied .",
    "we think the roughness of the interfaces is not too large to bring the convect effect in the channel and the fluid is incompressible .",
    "thus , we drop off the last two terms on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ nsequ ] ) . and for simplicity , we use @xmath24 to represent the two force terms by @xmath25 . based on the above considerations ,",
    "the complete ns equation is reduced to be @xmath26 now we apply the time fourier transformations of @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the both sides of the eq.([nsequ2 ] ) and transform the equation in the frequency domain to be @xmath29 we introduce a dyadic green function @xmath30 , satisfying the following equation @xmath31 with @xmath32 the dyadic unit and @xmath33 the position vector in the channel .",
    "we consider the equations of one fixed frequency and drop off the notation of @xmath34 for convenience .",
    "taking the dot product of @xmath35 on both sides of the eq.([nsu ] ) , and taking the dot product of @xmath36 on both sides of eq.([green ] ) , finally subtracting the two equations after the dot products , we obtain @xmath37\\cdot \\overset{\\leftrightarrow}{g}-\\vec{u}\\cdot [ \\nabla \\times \\nabla \\times \\overset{\\leftrightarrow}{g}]=\\frac{1}{\\eta } \\vec{f}\\cdot \\overset{\\leftrightarrow}{g}-\\vec{u}\\cdot \\overset{\\leftrightarrow}{i}\\delta(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}').\\ ] ] integrating both sides of the eq.([subtraction ] ) over the computational domain , we get the solution of @xmath36 for the liquid with the form of @xmath38 ds \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\int \\hspace{-0.3 cm } \\int \\hspace{-0.3 cm } \\int \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\vec{f}(r)\\cdot \\overset{\\leftrightarrow}{g}(r , r')dv .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the right hand side of the eq.([solutionu ] ) , the first integral of @xmath39 is the integral over the total surface of the computational domain , which is obtained by the applying of the green theorem on the volume integral of the left hand side of the eq.([subtraction ] ) .",
    "the green theorem has been shown in the appendix a. the @xmath40 is the unit vector outward normal to the interfaces . note that the direction of the @xmath40 varies on the interfaces due to the roughness .",
    "+ for simplicity , we assume the inlet of the channel along the @xmath14 direction is periodic to the outlet .",
    "thus the integral over the inlet and outlet cross - section surfaces would be cancelled .",
    "similar cancellation is hold for the integral over the cross - section surfaces normal to the @xmath17 direction due to the uniformity along the direction . in this way",
    ", the term of surface integral in the eq.([solutionu ] ) remains as the integral over the solid - liquid interfaces only . without losing the generality ,",
    "we will focus on only the upper interface to figure out the contribution of the roughness to the slip length , since the similar treatment can be applied to the lower interface . for convenience",
    ", we use @xmath41 to represent the integrand of the surface integral by @xmath42      the essential of the nbc is that the friction force applied on the fluid per unit length should be balanced by the shear stress of the fluid at the interface . the friction force and the shear stress",
    "have the same magnitude but the opposite directions .",
    "we denote the velocity component of the fluid parallel to the interfaces by @xmath43 .",
    "then in the case that the solid - liquid interfaces are ideally flat , the shear stress is along the @xmath14 direction and has been well defined as the product of the liquid viscosity @xmath2 and the normal gradient of the @xmath43 to the interface , while the friction force is along the @xmath44 direction and is the product of the friction coefficient @xmath3 and the @xmath43 at the interface .",
    "thus , for the ideal interfaces , the force balance can be expressed by @xmath45 valid at the interfaces , with the minus meaning the friction force resists the fluid flow .",
    "this is exactly the nbc . here",
    ", only the @xmath5 appears in the nbc , since no any effect of roughness of the interfaces contributes to the friction coefficient in such ideal case .",
    "the slip length then is defined as @xmath46 .",
    "+ in the non - ideal case that the solid - liquid interfaces are not ideally flat but with roughness , the nbc can be expressed locally since the force balance is still hold locally on the interfaces .",
    "we will average the fluid velocity eq.([solutionu ] ) over the rough interfaces to get an effective fluid velocity . from an alternative view",
    ", the effective fluid velocity can be solved from the ns equation by imposing an effective nbc(enbc ) on ideally flat interfaces .",
    "the enbc has absorbed the effect of roughness of the non - ideal interfaces into the friction coefficient @xmath3 of the ideally flat interfaces .",
    "the total friction coefficient @xmath3 of the flat interfaces after the average then is the sum of @xmath5 and @xmath6 as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "the total slip length @xmath0 of the flat interfaces after the average can be written as @xmath47 with @xmath46 and @xmath48 by using the equalities of @xmath12 and @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that for flat interfaces with @xmath50 , the contribution of chemical interaction dominates the friction force with @xmath51 .",
    "on the other side , when @xmath52 , the friction force then is dominated by the roughness of the interfaces with @xmath53 .",
    "so , after getting the total slip length @xmath0 of the confined liquid , the rough solid - liquid interfaces can be replaced by flat ones in an effective way , which simplifies the problems of the fluid dynamics in real systems with the roughness having been involved in the @xmath0 . in the following study , we will set the @xmath54 as a priori since the @xmath54 depends on the natural interaction between the solid surfaces and fluid molecules , and focus on the informations of the roughness .",
    "+ we start from the upper rough interface . for convenience , we denote @xmath55 the unit vector on the interface along the tangential direction in the @xmath56 plane and perpendicular to the @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath55 can be expressed by @xmath57 .",
    "the local force balance on the rough interfaces , hence the nbc , can be found generally to be @xmath58 in the general nbc , eq.([nc1 ] ) means the component of @xmath36 normal to the interfaces vanishes , showing that the liquid can not penetrate the solid surface . in the eq.([nc2 ] ) , the term on the left hand side is the shear stress which is along the @xmath55 direction and is on the plan normal to @xmath40 .",
    "the term on the right hand side of the eq.([nc2 ] ) is the friction force .",
    "the final condition eq.([nc3 ] ) means no stress along the @xmath17 direction according to our model . + it is emphasized here that the slip length used in the eq.([nc2 ] )",
    "is the @xmath46 and no @xmath6 is involved .",
    "this is because the force balance considered now is hold locally .",
    "the involvement of @xmath6 in the slip length @xmath0 will be obtained after the averaging of the eq.([solutionu ] ) over the rough interfaces by using the general nbc .",
    "for the application of the general nbc , we need to modify the eq.([nc1 ] , [ nc2 ] , [ nc3 ] ) to have the following forms @xmath59=-\\frac{1}{b_w } \\vec{u } \\cdot \\vec{u},\\\\ \\label{nc33 } & [ ( \\hat{n}\\cdot \\nabla)\\vec{u}]\\cdot [ \\hat{n}\\times \\vec{u}]=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above modification can be found in the appendix b.      we need to resolute the @xmath41 defined in eq.([k ] ) into several terms to figure out the effect of the roughness . before the resolution",

    "then , we can further simplify the terms of @xmath68 to be @xmath69 in the above simplification , the equality of @xmath70 has been applied .",
    "the similar treatment can be applied to the vector @xmath71 in the @xmath41 , leading to @xmath72 thus , the integrand @xmath41 defined in the eq.([k ] ) can be written as @xmath73 it can be understood that for an ideally flat interface where the @xmath55 is not a variable but a constant vector along the @xmath14 direction on the interface , the two terms of @xmath74 and @xmath75 both disappear because the operator @xmath76 applied on the constant vector @xmath55 causes zero in the eq.([t2 ] , [ t3 ] ) . and",
    "then only the terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 remain in the @xmath41 for the ideally flat interface .",
    "therefor , the terms of @xmath79 in the @xmath41 are originated from the roughness of the interface .",

    "the local unit vectors of the interface can be expressed in the term of @xmath80 , reading @xmath81 with @xmath82 now we need to average the fluid velocity @xmath36 over the rough interface to get an effective velocity @xmath83 .",
    "alternatively , the fluid vector @xmath84 can be solved from the ns equation by imposing the enbc on a flat interface .",
    "the enbc for such flat interface should have the form of @xmath85 here , the total slip length @xmath0 has been used to comprise the two effects of the interface , the chemical interaction and the roughness .",

    "the boundary conditions for the @xmath86 are the same as the eq.([nci ] ) only by replacing the @xmath87 with the @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent the @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath13 coordinates .",
    "note that @xmath88 is the component of @xmath86 , meaning that the influence of the source of @xmath89 component is on the object of @xmath90 component .",
    "we expand the @xmath36 and @xmath91 of the rough interface in the terms of @xmath84 and @xmath86 of the flat interface respectively .",
    "since the friction force considered is parallel to the @xmath14 direction and the @xmath17 component of the friction force is negligible , we only consider the @xmath14 component of @xmath36 for the expansion and neglect the @xmath17 and @xmath13 components .",

    "we have noted that the roughness of the interface should not be too large , or the roughness will bring the convection and turbulence effects to the system . under the condition of @xmath93 , the perturbation expansion of the @xmath94 and the @xmath92 read @xmath95 in above derivation , the enbc of eq.([nci ] )",

    "that means if @xmath54 is infinite , @xmath117 must be infinite too and then is the @xmath0 .",
    "in this work , we have studied the slip length of the confined liquid with small roughness of solid - liquid interfaces .",
    "the quantitative expression of the slip length has been obtained , in which the roughness of the interfaces and the chemical interaction between the liquid and the solid are involved . in the study ,",
    "perturbation expansion of the interface roughness is required .",
    "the results we have obtained are threefold .",
    "first , the slip length @xmath0 of the confined liquid is linearly proportional to the slip length @xmath54 contributed from the chemical interaction .",
    "second , the roughness of the interface plays its role as a proportionality factor for the @xmath0 and the @xmath54 . and only with the chemical interaction together does the roughness have its effect on the @xmath0 .",
    "finally , large variance of the roughness decreases the @xmath0 and the increasing of the correlation length of the roughness increases the slip length in a dramatical way to a saturation value .",
    "those results propose that we need to improve our techniques to smooth the solid surfaces by enlarging the correlation length of the roughness as well as decreasing the variance of the roughness for the channel fabrication besides to find proper materials with large @xmath54 .",
    "+ it has been revealed that some biological nanopores have peculiar features in the transport of water . such as in the aquaporin channels as the key component of many biological processes ,",
    "the permeability of water is larger than what is expected in classical nanofluidic framework by three orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the hydrophobic surface of the aquaporin channels is the potential mechanism to the large permeability of water in the channels . to supplement the suggestion",
    ", we think that the large correlation length of the channels may contribute to the water transport as have been studied in this work , even though how the positions are correlated in the aquaporin channels is not clear .",
    "what is more , the biological nanopores are active matters , in which the correlation between the two positions on the nanopore interfaces may behave in a complicated way rather than what does in the artificial nanofluidic frameworks .",
    "the consideration of the correlation length in the biological nanopores is the extension of this work and under the research .",
