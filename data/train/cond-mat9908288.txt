    "such `` microfluidics '' systems  @xcite are promising for future applications , e.g. , in chemistry and biology  @xcite .",
    "although the performance of these systems ultimately depends on their dynamic properties , a thorough understanding of the corresponding structural properties in thermal equilibrium is an important prerequisite  @xcite . in this spirit as a paradigmatic case we determine the equilibrium structures of liquidlike wetting films forming at the interface between a bulk vapor phase and a flat solid substrate containing a single chemical stripe ( fig .  [ f : system ] ) .",
    "our aim is to explore the entire phase diagram for the emerging lateral fluid structures as function of temperature , undersaturation or pressure , and stripe width .    in ref .",

    "@xcite we study a substrate designed such that the effective interface potential @xmath4 of the stripe part exhibits two competing local minima ( `` i '' near and `` iii '' further away from the substrate surface ) whereas the asymptotic film thickness @xmath5 far from the stripe is given by the single global minimum ( `` ii '' ) of the interface potential @xmath6 of the embedding substrate ( see fig .

    "@xcite the phase diagram for this morphological phase transition has been determined , at constant temperature @xmath7 , as function of the stripe width @xmath8 and of the undersaturation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the chemical potential at liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to determine how this phase diagram for the morphological phase transition within the @xmath8-@xmath11 plane evolves as function of temperature .",
    "this additional information is important in order to be able to put the morphological phase transitions into the context of @xmath7-@xmath11 wetting phase diagrams , including the prewetting line , on homogeneous substrates  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that experimental techniques such as reflection interference contrast microscopy ( ricm )  @xcite and atomic force microscopy ( afm ) in tapping mode  @xcite are capable of imaging the liquidlike structures under consideration down to the nm scale .",
    "moreover , due to their relatively small spatial extensions the structures discussed here are well accessible by monte carlo simulations as another means for testing the theoretical predictions . for these envisaged studies",
    "the knowledge of the full topology of the phase diagram as function of @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath8 is very important .",
    "we use the following simple interface displacement model within which the equilibrium interface profile @xmath12 minimizes the functional @xmath13 = \\int_a dx\\,dy\\,\\lambda(x , l(x ) ) + \\sigma_{lg}\\int_a dx\\,dy\\,\\left(\\frac{dl(x)}{dx}\\right)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the area of the flat substrate surface located at @xmath15 .",

    "is given by @xmath26 which is of the form @xmath27 .",
    "for reasons of simplicity we assume that the lateral variation of @xmath26 is steplike : @xmath28 with the effective interface potential @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) of a _ homogeneous _ substrate composed of `` @xmath2 '' ( `` @xmath3 '' ) particles . in refs .",

    "we also found ( see fig .",
    "11 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the aforementioned steplike variation of @xmath26 as opposed to its actual smooth lateral variation represents a rather reliable approximation .",
    "the form of @xmath26 follows from considering as the interaction potential between the fluid particles a lennard - jones potential with a depth @xmath31 and an effective particle diameter @xmath32 .",

    "since the substrate is translationally invariant in the @xmath33 direction the effective interface potential depends only on @xmath34 , so that @xmath12 is also translationally invariant in the @xmath33 direction .",
    "the interaction potential parameters of the stripe part ( `` @xmath2 '' ) are the same as for the `` @xmath2 '' substrate described in fig .  11 in ref .",

    "the systems under consideration here differ from those studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in two important aspects .",
    "first , here the liquidlike films are so thin that they are completely under the influence of the substrate potential which determines , inter alia , the effective interface potential . secondly",
