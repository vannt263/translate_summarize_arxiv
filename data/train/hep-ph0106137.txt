    "in physics at the highest available energies , it is always important to exploit simple reactions and decays so as to search for new forces , for new dynamics , and for discrete symmetry violations .",

    "the helicity parameters appear directly in various polarization and spin - correlation functions such as those obtained in ref.[5 ] .",
    "since the helicity parameters appear directly in the various polarization and spin - correlation functions , it is clearly more model independent to simply measure them rather than to set limits on an  ad hoc \" set of additional coupling constants [ 3 ] .    in the plots in refs.[3,4 ] , the values of the helicity parameters",

    "( 3 ) from consideration of table 1 , a third ( non - dynamical ) phase ambiguity can be constructed by making an arbitrary sign - flip in the @xmath59 amplitudes , with no corresponding sign changes in the @xmath60 amplitudes .",
    "its exclusion , as well as determination of the 2 remaining independent relative phases necessary for a complete amplitude measurement will require direct empirical information about the @xmath60-amplitudes such as from a @xmath61 polarimetry measurement [ 5 ] of the @xmath62-polarimetry interference parameters .",
    "such measurements will be difficult unless certain non - sm couplings occur : non - chiral couplings like @xmath63 or @xmath64 , @xmath65 or @xmath66 ( for @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 or @xmath69 ( for @xmath70 ) can produce large effects[3 ] .",

    "due the dominance of the l - handed amplitudes in the sm , the occurrence of the two dynamical ambiguities [ 1 ] displayed in lower part of table 1 is not surprising for these 3 chiral combinations only contribute to the l - handed b - quark amplitudes as @xmath74 . since pairwise",

    "nevertheless , dynamical ssb and compositeness / condensate considerations do continue to stimulate interest [ 5 ] in additional tensorial @xmath88 couplings . in table 1",

    "consequently , all of the primed helicity parameters [ 5,4 ] are zero .. @xmath13-invariance will be violated if either ( i ) there is a fundamental violation of canonical  time reversal \" invariance , or ( ii ) there are absorptive final - state interactions . in the sm , there are no such final - state interactions at the level of sensitivities considered in the present analysis . to assess future measurements of helicity parameters in regard to @xmath13-violation , ref .",

    "( i ) an additional @xmath92 type coupling with a complex phase versus the sm s @xmath103 is equivalent to an additional overall complex factor in the sm s helicity amplitudes .",

    "so in [ 4 ] , to test for the presence of @xmath13-violation due to additonal gauge type couplings , there are plots of the b - polarimetry interference parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 , and of the partial width for @xmath36 versus pure - imaginary coupling constant @xmath102 .",
