    "theoretically , in order to obtain the reliable prediction , one of the main roles is to evaluate the short - distance qcd corrections to hadronic matrix elements of @xmath15 meson decays . in this respect , the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) approach @xcite , the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) approach @xcite and the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite are explored and widely used to calculate the amplitudes of @xmath15 meson decays .    in the @xmath16 corrections , although the weak annihilation  ( wa ) amplitudes are formally @xmath17 power - suppressed , they are generally nontrivial , especially for the flavor - changing - neutral - current  ( fcnc ) dominated and pure annihilation b decays .",
    "furthermore , because of the possible strong phase provided by the wa amplitude , the wa contribution also play an indispensable role for evaluating the charge - parity  ( cp ) asymmetry .",
    "unfortunately , in the collinear factorization approach , the calculation of wa corrections always suffers from the divergence at the end - point of convolution integrals of meson s light - cone distribution amplitudes  ( lcda ) . in the scet ,",
    "the annihilation diagrams are factorizable and real to the leading power of @xmath18  @xcite . in the qcdf",
    ", the end - point divergence are usually parameterized by the phenomenological parameter @xmath19 defined as @xcite @xmath20 in which @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are phenomenological parameters and responsible for the strength and the possible strong phase of wa correction near the end - point , respectively .",
    "in addition , for the hard spectator scattering  ( hss ) contributions , the calculation of twist-3 distribution amplitudes also suffers from end - point divergence , which is usually dealt with the same parameterization scheme as eq .   and",
    "labeled by @xmath24 .",
    "so far , the values of @xmath25 are utterly unknown from the first principles of qcd dynamics , and thus can only be obtained through the experimental data .",

    "meanwhile , the flavor dependence of @xmath38 on the initial states , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , should be carefully considered .",
    "moreover , the global fits of the end - point parameters in @xmath7 and @xmath42 decays have confirmed such  new treatment \" , except for that the flavor symmetry breaking effect of wa parameters is hard to be distinguished due to the experimental errors and theoretical uncertainties  @xcite .",

    "numerically , we get @xmath189)^{l,\\,t}= ( 0.97_{-0.39}^{+0.67},-214_{-44}^{+14}),~(1.65_{-0.23}^{+0.13},-108_{-10}^{+13})\\ , . \\quad \\text{solution $ \\rm a'$}\\ ] ]    using the values of @xmath190 in eq .",
    ", we present the theoretical results for @xmath9 decays in the  case iv \" columns of tables [ tab : rhok ] , [ tab : kk ] , [ tab : phik ] , [ tab : rhorho ] and [ tab : phiphi ] .",
    "all of the theoretical results are in consistence with the data within the errors and uncertainties . comparing case ii with case",
    "iv , one can find some significant differences , especially for the pure annihilation @xmath191 decay .",
    "for instance , case ii presents a large branching fraction @xmath192 , which is in the scope of superkekb / belle - ii experiment , while the prediction of case iv , @xmath193 , is very small .",
    "moreover , case iv presents a much larger transverse polarization fraction , @xmath194 , than case ii .",
    "in addition , we note that the amplitude @xmath195 is only relevant to the effective coefficients @xmath196 and @xmath197 , and both of which involve @xmath198 only .",
    "it implies that @xmath191 decay is very suitable for probing the non - factorizable wa contributions .",
    "the measurement of pure annihilation decays is required for testing such results and exploring a much clearer picture of wa contributions .",
    "in summary , we have studied the effects of weak annihilation and hard spectator scattering contributions in @xmath199 decays with the qcdf approach . in order to evaluate the values of end - point parameters , comprehensive statistical @xmath5 analyses",
    "are preformed in four cases .",
    "our analyses in cases i and ii are based on the topology - dependent parameterization scheme , which is presented first in ref .",
    "@xcite and favored by @xmath145 decays  @xcite .",
    "the analyses in cases  iii and iv are based on the polarization - dependent parameterization scheme ( _ i.e. _ , the end - point parameters are non - universal for longitudinal and transverse building blocks ) . in each of cases , a global fit of end - point parameters",
    "is performed with the data available , and the numerical results are presented .",
    "our main conclusions and findings could be summarized as the following :    * the allowed spaces of @xmath149 at 95% c. l. are entirely different from that of @xmath70 in @xmath9 decays , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath200 , which confirms the proposal of topology - dependent scheme presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , the fitted result of @xmath70 in @xmath9 decays is very similar to the ones in @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays , which implies possible universal end - point contributions for the factorizable annihilation topologies . * the findings mentioned above",
    "are gotten mainly through penguin - dominated decays .",
    "unfortunately , some tensions between theoretical results and data appear when the color - suppressed tree - dominated @xmath201 decay is taken into account . to be exact",
    ", a large @xmath153 and/or the simplification @xmath202 , which has been proven to be a good simplification by a global fit in @xmath145 decays  @xcite , are challenged especially by @xmath11 .",
    "we further point out that any hypothesis for resolving the `` @xmath12 puzzle '' through modifying hss corrections should be carefully tested in @xmath166 decays .",
    "* for the polarization - dependent scheme , an ideal strategy is to extract the longitudinal end - point parameters through the longitudinal - polarization - dominated decay modes and further analysis their topology - dependence .",
    "however , the lack of data and large uncertainties prevent us from obtaining an exact result . combining all of the decays considered in this paper , the fitted result at 95% c. l. indicates that @xmath13 . using the fitted values of end - point parameters ,",
    "the experimental data could be accommodated within qcdf framework .",
    "generally , because @xmath9 decays involve more observables than @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays , more information for the wa and hss contributions can be obtained , which surely helps us to further explore and understand the underlying mechanism .",
    "however , the measurements of @xmath9 decays are still very rough by now , especially for the complete angular analysis and the pure annihilation decays . with the rapid accumulation of data on b events at running lhc and forthcoming superkekb / belle - ii , more refined measurements of @xmath9 decays are urgently expected for a much clearer picture of wa and hss contributions .",
