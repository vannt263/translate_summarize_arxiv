    "the existence of a massive black hole in the galactic center is a keystone in the understanding of stellar dynamics in the inner parsec of the galaxy ( see the contributions of ghez and eckart in this volume ) as it is a test case for the theory of accretion flows in active and non - active galactic nucleii ( mezger , duschl & zylka , 1996 ) .",
    "standard thin accretion disks fail to explain the luminosity and spectrum of the radio source sgr a@xmath0 and several models for the accretion and emission processes have been suggested .",
    "optically thick synchrotron emission from a jet - disk system ( falcke et al . , 1996 ) or from an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) were investigated ( narayan et al . ,",
    "1998 ) , while optically thin emission by highly relativistic particles with a quasi - monoenergetic distribution ( e.g. beckert & duschl 1997 ) is also a possible mechanism .",
    "mahadevan ( 1998 , and this volume ) propose secondary electrons from pion decay in adaf s as the synchrotron emitting particles and showed a way to connect the accretion flow as an energy source with the relativistic electrons .",
    "we present a simplified relativistic treatment of advection - dominated accretion in the galactic center and propose a switch between standard and adaf accretion to distinguish agn s and sub - luminous galactic centers .",
    "advection dominated accretion flows are geometrically thick and a description in spherical coordinates is appropriate . in order to aviod complications due to frame dragging by a rotating black hole we use the schwarzschild metric and hope to see also the characteristics of accretion into a slowly rotating hole .",
    "the effects of strong gravity and the existence of a horizon are correctly described in this way .",
    "the dynamics of an accretion flow into a black hole is governed by energy and momentum conservation .",
    "energy losses due to radiation have to be calculated and applied seperately .",
    "angular momentum is transported into the black hole and to larger radii than those under consideration so a momentum flux through the boudaries of the disk occurs .",
    "we will neglect magnetic torques in our treatment and consider only a contribution of the magentic pressure in the flow to the total pressure by scaling it as @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamics can then be derived from the divergence of the stress - energy tensor @xmath2 the density @xmath3 contains a contribution from the specific enthalpy of the gas like @xmath4 with the rest mass density @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 are the components of the 4-velocity of the flow , @xmath7 the isotropic pressure and @xmath8 the metric tensor .",
    "the viscous part of the stress - energy tensor contains the kinematical viscosity @xmath9 and the shear - stresses @xmath10 .",
    "we have added a contribution by a possible heat flux @xmath11 which has to be orthogonal to the velocity .",
    "the 0-component of the divergence in ( @xmath12 ) is an energy equation for the flow , but does not resemble the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "this is formulated for a system at rest so we have to project the divergence in ( [ fund ] ) onto the 4-velocity of the flow .",
    "the tool for this is a symmetric projector @xmath13 after the projection we get an energy equation like @xmath14 here we have used the substantial derivative @xmath15 and the acceleration @xmath16 . in the following we treat stationary and axisymmetric flows with radial infall .      in optically thin plasma",
    "the heat produced locally by viscous friction will be either maintained as internal energy or radiated away .",
    "diffusive transport by radiation will not occur . instead of a radiative transport we expect turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability ( e.g. balbus & hawley , 1998 ) to transport heat effectively perpendicular to the flow .",
    "so we approximate the poloidal structure by an isothermal plasma in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the poloidal stratification is given by @xmath17 with the assumed isothermal equation of state we can integrate and obtain @xmath18 \\qquad .\\ ] ] one obtains the criterion for the flow to be a thin disk as @xmath19 we take @xmath20 at constant temperature for an ideal gas . the internal energy and so the enthalpy rises strongly with temperature when the particles become relativistic and the disk thickness will shrink in the relativistic inner part close to the black hole .      in a stationary state as we are interested in the angular momentum distribution is determined by diffusive transport due to an effective turbulent viscosity @xmath21 for the viscosity we take a parametrisation @xmath22 proposed by duschl , strittmater & biermann which is discussed by r. auer ( this volume ) . for the self - similiar solution of narayan & yi ( 1994 ) this viscosity",
    "has the same radial dependence as the standard form by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) . whenever the adaf s deviate from the power - law behavior the viscosity",
    "is not coupled to the thermal state of the flow but rather to the dynamical structure . ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is proportional to the inverse of the critical reynolds number @xmath24 in the flow .",
    "mhd - instabilities may produce turbulence at rather small @xmath25 , so we take @xmath26 .",
    "the radial momentum balance @xmath27\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] includes the viscous braking in a converging flow and the inertia and pressure terms .",
    "the centrifugal force reverses sign at @xmath28 .",
    "the length scale @xmath29 is the gravitational radius with @xmath30 the mass of the black hole .",
    "the thermal balance in a stationary state is given by @xmath31 the flow cools via bremsstrahlung , synchrotron- and inverse compton losses ( @xmath32 ) , while the disk is heated by viscous friction @xmath33\\ ] ] and the divergence of a possible heat flux @xmath34 . the heat flux in collisionless plasma is approximated by @xmath35 . in a magnetizied plasma the heat flux",
    "is expected to be strongly depressed so we take @xmath36 .",
    "the heat generated in the flow is not completely radiated but is advected with the flow according to @xmath37   \\qquad .\\ ] ] the thermodynamic quantities @xmath38 are taken from the relativistic equation of state for an ideal gas . the thermal balance must be treated for electrons and ions separately with an exchange of heat between the two species .",
    "this is assumed to occur only by coulomb collisions but is subject to debate , as energy transfer due to resonant scattering of electrons by whistler waves can not be excluded .",
    "the vertically averaged dynamical equations for stationary flows presented above allow for a self - similiar solution in the newtonian limit and a constant advection ratio ( narayan & yi , 1994 ) , so that @xmath39 replaces the energy equation ( [ eeq ] ) .",
    "the self - similiarity implies constant logarithmic gradients for all variables @xmath40 as shown here for the angular velocity .",
    "the differential equations are decoupled and one obtains a set of algebraic equations , which can be easyly solved .",
    "we use a logarithmic radial grid and solve the algebraic equations with the full energy balance at all points . from the local solutions we recalculate the actual logarithmic gradients for a next iteration step . in doing",
    "so we avoid inner regularity conditions at critical ( sonic ) points .",
    "the steep gradients present in the solutions at 3 schwarzschild radii ( fig .",
    "[ temp ] ) lead to a slow convergence and the solutions shown are not completely relaxed to a stationary state .",
    "the cooling of the flow by radiation is unimportant at very small accretion rates and the radiation processes have no backreaction on the dynamics of the flow .",
    "we include bremsstrahlung , synchrotron and inverse compton - scattered synchrotron radiation in a rough approximation in the energy equation and derive the spectra from the adaf - solutions afterwards .",
    "the accretion rate necessary to power the galactic center source sgr a@xmath0 is @xmath41 m@xmath42/yr for a thin accretion disk . but upper limits from ir - measurements allow only a mass flux of @xmath43 m@xmath42/yr or lower .",
    "the inefficiency of adaf - emission processes point to much larger accretion rates , which are determined from a simultaneous fit of sub - mm and x - ray measurements .",
    "the critical parameters are the mass of the black hole , here @xmath44 m@xmath42 , the distance to the galactic center @xmath45 kpc and the hydrogen column density for soft x - ray absorption @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "we assume that most radio observations are dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons and the adaf contributes significantly in the sub - mm regime only .",
    "this minimal adaf - model is calculated with a plasma-@xmath48 and is correspondingly gas pressure dominated .",
    "the derived mass accretion rate is @xmath49 m@xmath42/yr .",
    "temperatures and surface density of this model is shown in fig .",
    "[ temp ] . in contradiction to the analytical solutions and narayan & yi ( 1995 ) we find bernoulli numbers less than 1 , corresponding to the rest mass at infinity as seen in fig .",
    "the radiation inefficiency is shown in fig .",
    "[ lum ] , where the local luminosity is compared to the luminosity of a thin disk at the same accretion rate .",
    "the optically thick self - absorbed synchrotron radiation of the adaf emerges in the radio and sub - mm regime and rises steeply to a maximum at @xmath50 ghz .",
    "it shows an even steeper cut - off for larger frequencies seen in fig .",
    "[ radio ] . most of the radio observations can not be explained by the adaf itself .",
    "one possible source for this radiation are relativistic electrons of @xmath51 mev emitting optically thin synchrotron radiation in a weak magnetic field @xmath52 g. assuming a homgeneous source its radius is at least @xmath53 cm , much larger than the synchrotron emitting region of the adaf and thus providing an extended halo .",
    "these relativistic electrons can be accelerated in magnetic reconnection sheets ( schopper , lesch & birk , 1998 ) and maintained in a quasi - monoenergetic distribution ( jauch , this volume ) or they may be secondary electrons from charged pion decays ( mahadevan , 1998 ) .",
    "for mass accretion rates below 0.1 @xmath54 there are two possible states of accretion into black holes . the standard thin disk ( frank , king & raine , 1992 ) , which looses all the energy produced by viscous friction locally , and the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) described above .",
    "when we compare the radially integrated luminosity of the two kinds of accretion flows at the same accretion rate , we find roughly the same luminosity for a critical mass flow rate of @xmath55 . at smaller rates",
    "the luminosity of adaf s drop dramatically , while the luminosity of efficiently radiating flows is proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath56 .",
    "the ratio of the luminosities for adaf s to @xmath57 gives the amount of specific energy advected into the black hole and the inefficiency of the heat transfer between electrons and ions .",
    "as both states of accretion are available at the same time in a stationary flow , there must be a physical reason , which enforces the flow to be advection - dominated or not .",
    "if a mechanism is at work deciding in which state the flow will be , it provides a switch to turn a luminous accreting black hole into a quiet sink of matter or the other way round .",
    "let us , for the moment being , assume that , whenever available , an accretion disk chooses to operate in the advection dominated regime , which is indicated by the extremely low luminosity of the galactic center .",
    "then comparatively small changes in the mass flow rate through the disk may result in dramatic changes of the efficiency of the accretion process , i.e. , the luminosity of the agn .",
    "this highly non - linear behaviour of the luminosity as a function of the accretion rate has the potential of acting almost as a switch between an agn phase of a galaxy and a non - active phase whithout having to change the mass flow rate by a similar amount as the luminosity . in our example of fig.[agn - switch ] , at a mass flow rate of @xmath58/yr an increase of the rate by two orders of magnitude results in almost a million times larger a luminosity .",
