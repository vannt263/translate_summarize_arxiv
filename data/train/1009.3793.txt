    "charged particle identification is critical for a heavy flavour physics experiment .",
    "it is required both for separating signal decays from more copious backgrounds , such as @xmath1 from @xmath2 , and for tagging the initial flavour of neutral mesons which may undergo mixing .",
    "one way to accomplish this is with a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) system , in which mass hypotheses are tested by measuring the angle ( @xmath3 ) and number of cherenkov photons emitted by a charged particle passing through a radiator . for a given detector geometry ,",
    "the separation power between @xmath4 and @xmath5 hypotheses depends on the refractive index @xmath6 of the radiator and the momentum @xmath7 of the particle . between the pion and kaon thresholds ,",
    "pions are positively identified but kaons are identified only by the absence of photons . in principle",
    "this can provide good separation , but it is vulnerable to background from fake tracks ( e.g. due to mistakes in pattern recognition in the tracking system ) , which can not create cherenkov photons and so would be identified as kaons .",
    "likewise , protons would not be distinguished from kaons .",
    "therefore , it is desirable to work above the kaon threshold  and in an environment with high occupancy in the tracking system or a large number of protons , it is essential .    at lhcb",
    "@xcite , particle identification is needed for the momentum range from 2gev@xmath0 to 100gev@xmath0 .",
    "this is currently accomplished by a rich system  @xcite consisting of two detectors with three radiators .",
    "two of these are gaseous : c@xmath8f@xmath9 and cf@xmath8 , with refractive indices of 1.0014 and 1.0005 , respectively , for visible light at stp .",
    "these correspond to kaon cherenkov thresholds of 9.3 and 15.6gev@xmath0 , and together provide better than @xmath10 kaon - pion separation up to 100gev@xmath0 .",
    "positive kaon identification from 210gev@xmath0 requires a third radiator with a kaon cherenkov threshold around 2gev@xmath0 , corresponding to @xmath11 .",
    "this excludes conventional materials : the phase transition from gas to liquid or solid is associated with a large jump in @xmath12 from @xmath13 or smaller to @xmath14 .",
    "the low density of aerogel gives it a suitable refractive index : lhcb s third radiator is aerogel with @xmath15 in air and @xmath16 in c@xmath8f@xmath9 .",
    "however , rayleigh scattering limits the useful light yield : approximately 7 detected photoelectrons are expected at lhcb for a saturated track in aerogel . in a high - background scenario , such as the proposed lhcb upgrade from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , kaon - pion discrimination from aerogel would be severely compromised  @xcite .",
    "another method of charged particle identification is by time of flight measurement .",
    "the principle is simple : if a particle of mass @xmath19 is detected at position @xmath20 and time @xmath21 after leaving the origin , then @xmath22\\ ] ] and so the difference in expected time between kaons and pions would be @xmath23    .\\ ] ] therefore , to obtain @xmath10 separation between the two hypotheses the time resolution @xmath24 must satisfy @xmath25    .\\ ] ] if this approach were to be used for kaon identification in the range 210gev@xmath0 and the path length were @xmath26 m , then a per - track time resolution @xmath27ps would be required .",
    "a very fast response would be needed ",
    "cherenkov radiation would be suitable for this purpose .",
    "if the expected light yield were 50 detected photoelectrons , a per - photon time resolution under 90ps would be required .",
    "a third method is to measure the time of propagation @xmath28 over a path length @xmath29 of cherenkov photons emitted by a charged particle . in a dispersive medium ,",
    "photons propagate at the group velocity @xmath30 , and so @xmath31 the relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath32 is a non - linear function that depends on the medium but obeys : @xmath33 after computing @xmath6 from @xmath32 , the mass of the particle can be extracted : @xmath34    the methods outlined above may be combined in an elegant way . consider a large , thin plane of an optically dense medium such as quartz .",
    "charged particles passing through the plane emit cherenkov photons , which propagate to the edges via total internal reflection as in the babar dirc  @xcite .",
    "the arrival time of a photon at the edge of the plane is the sum of the time of flight of the track to the emission point , @xmath21 , and the time of propagation of the photon in the medium , @xmath28 .",
    "then @xmath35 where @xmath32 may be determined from @xmath36 both @xmath37 and @xmath38 have the same sign so the two effects combine constructively . for a given track , the first term of eq .",
    "[ eq : timesum ] is fixed but the second depends on the direction and path length of the photon , which must be reconstructed for each photon individually  for the planar geometry outlined above , this can be done by measuring two independent angles for each photon .",
    "this is the principle behind the design of the torch , and of the belle upgrade top  @xcite and panda endcap dirc  @xcite which inspired it .",
    "the torch detector consists of a plane of quartz covering the full lhcb angular acceptance and placed 12 m downstream of the interaction point , plus focusing elements and photodetectors along each edge .",
    "the quartz plate has dimensions 7440mm@xmath396120 mm , with a hole of 26mm@xmath3926 mm at the centre for the beampipe , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : layout ] .",
    "the focusing element uses a cylindrical mirror to focus the light such that the distance along the photodetector plane is approximately proportional to the angle @xmath40 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : focus ] .",
    "this angle is key : the overall resolution is dominated by the pixelization uncertainty on @xmath40 . from simulation studies ,",
    "we find that a 128-channel segmentation and a dynamic range of 400mrad corresponds to an uncertainty of 0.96mrad on @xmath40 and per - photon uncertainty on the time of propagation of @xmath41 .",
    "the granularity requirement in the other dimension is much looser , since the azimuthal angle is typically measured with a lever arm of a few metres : @xmath42 is sufficient match the 1mrad resolution .",
    "( right ) .",
    "the focusing of photons is shown for five illustrative angles between 450 and 850mrad , emerging at different points across the edge of the plate .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the key property required of the photodetector is high speed : its intrinsic time spread should be significantly better than 90ps .",
    "the photon detection technology which currently gives the best time resolution is the use of micro - channel plate photomultipliers ( mcp - pmt ) .",
    "they have been used in r&d for a related concept under development by the belle collaboration for their upgrade  @xcite , with single - photon time resolutions of 35ps achieved .",
    "an example of a commercially - available detector of this type which comes close to satisfying the requirements of torch is the photonis@xmath43 xp85022 mcp - pmt .",
    "this is available in a 1024-channel version , with an array of @xmath44 pixels in a @xmath45mm@xmath46 active area , and overall dimension of 59 mm .",
    "for the sake of developing a concrete design for torch we have assumed the use of this photodetector , laid side - by - side with a pitch of 60 mm along the edges of the plane .",
    "the anode structure of an mcp - pmt consists simply of conductive pads to read out the charge , and the pixellization can therefore in principle be adjusted . for the simulation of torch",
    "we have assumed an array of @xmath47 pixels of dimension @xmath48 .",
    "following the approach outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] for the design from sec .",
    "[ sec : design ] , the reconstruction is relatively straightforward : we measure the arrival time and position of a photon on the photodetector plane , infer @xmath40 , and calculate its trajectory assuming it was emitted by the track at the midpoint in @xmath49 of its path through the quartz block . given measurements of the track path and momentum from a tracking system and knowledge of the optical properties of quartz , this is sufficient information to compute all quantities in eq .",
    "[ eq : timesum ] and  [ eq : timesum_n ] and extract the mass from @xmath50 .",
    "there are two major practical challenges , though : first , association of photons to tracks ( pattern recognition ) ; and second , determining the time when the track left the origin .",
    "pattern recognition is critical : in the environment of the upgraded lhcb luminosity , there may be @xmath51 fully reconstructed tracks plus a large number of secondaries passing through the torch in an event .",
    "however , most photon - track pairs can be rejected as unphysical .",
    "we take advantage of the limited range of photon wavelengths to which the photodetector is sensitive and reject candidates outside this range .",
    "this is mathematically equivalent to a restriction on @xmath3 : for our geometry , this means that relevant photons lie roughly along arcs on the photodetector plane .",
    "additionally , we can ignore photon - track pairs with unphysical timing . instead of attempting to measure the mass of the particle directly",
    ", we assume @xmath52 hypotheses and test for consistency with each in turn .",
    "background photons whose timing is not consistent with any of these masses can be ignored .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] it was assumed that the track left the origin at @xmath53or equivalently , that the relative timing between the photodetector and the initial collision is known .",
    "however , we can not rely on an external clock for 10ps - level timing  and even if we could , the luminous region at lhcb extends a few  cm in @xmath49 , which would add a smearing of order a few tens of ps .",
    "we must therefore measure the track start time ourselves .",
    "one approach would be to install a second torch - like detector close to the interaction point , at the price of additional cost , material , and time resolution .",
    "a more efficient solution is to take advantage of the high pion multiplicity at a hadron collider and use other tracks from the same event primary vertex to fix the relative timing .",
    "the same reconstruction procedure described above is used except that the last step is inverted : for each track from the event primary vertex , the pion mass is assumed as the input and the time elapsed @xmath54 is calculated from eq .",
    "[ eq : timesum ] .",
    "subtracting this from the measured photon detection time gives a measurement of the track start time .",
    "for a primary vertex with @xmath55 fully reconstructed pion tracks , the start time resolution is smaller than the per - track time resolution by roughly @xmath56 .",
    "to test the particle identification performance , we take events from the full lhcb monte carlo simulation , determine the set of charged particles that would pass through the torch , simulate the emission , propagation , and detection of cherenkov radiation in the torch for these particles with a stand - alone program , then apply the reconstruction and pattern - recognition procedure outlined above to the output .",
    "no truth information is used for the reconstruction and pattern - recognition . however ,",
    "a number of simplifying assumptions were made : perfect measurements of track position and momentum , perfect extrapolation of tracks through the magnetic field of the detector , negligible electronics noise and cross - talk ; negligible spill - over between events ; and no multiple scattering , delta ray emission , or inelastic collisions in the torch .",
    "background from certain sources such as backscatter from the calorimeters was not available to the simulation and was also neglected .",
    "we characterize the performance in terms of particle identification efficiencies for those kaon and pion tracks which would be useful for physics analysis .",
    "specifically , we require tracks to be well - measured ( with track segments found both upstream and downstream of the magnet ) , well - matched to an event primary vertex , and associated to a kaon or pion in the monte carlo truth information .",
    "tracks are identified either as kaons or as pions according to which of the two hypotheses is found to be most consistent by the pattern recognition .",
    "the efficiency is shown as a function of track momentum in fig .",
    "[ fig : effic - reqpv ] for events simulated at a luminosity of @xmath57 .",
    "the efficiency for correct identification is @xmath58 up to 10gev@xmath0 , dropping at higher momentum as the time difference between kaon and pion hypotheses diminishes .",
    "the torch concept is intended to provide charged particle identification in the momentum range 210gev@xmath0 in a high - rate environment .",
    "it has been shown that the pattern - recognition problem is solvable and that target performance can be reached under simplified conditions .",
    "the challenge is now to test whether this performance can be maintained under realistic conditions and at @xmath59 .",
    "this will require prototype tests and more detailed simulation .",
    "a revised , modular design with a smaller quartz plane is also under investigation .",
    "the torch concept has evolved from ideas that have been demonstrated in the babar dirc , and related developments that are under study by the panda and belle collaborations .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank bjoern seitz for fruitful discussion , and our colleagues in the lhcb rich group for their interest ."
