    "the race to understanding and explaining the emergence of complex structures and behavior has a wide variety of participants in contemporary science , whether it be sociology , physics , biology or any of the other major sciences .",
    "one of the more well - trodden paths is one where evolutionary processes play an important role in the emergence of complex structures .",
    "when various organisms compete over limited resources , complex behavior can be beneficial to outperform competitors .",
    "but the question remains : can we _ quantify _ the change of complexity throughout evolutionary processes ?",
    "the experiment we undertake in this paper addresses this question through an empirical approach . in very general terms , we simulate two simple organisms on a computer that compete over limited available resources . since this experiment takes place in a rather abstract modeling setting , we will use the term _ processes _ instead of organisms from now on .",
    "two competing processes evolve over time and we measure how the complexity of the emerging patterns evolves as the two processes interact . the complexity of the emerging structures will be compared to the complexity of the respective processes as they would have evolved without any interaction .    when setting up an experiment , especially one of an abstract nature , a subtle yet essential question emerges . _ what _ exactly defines a particular process and how does the process distinguish itself from the background ?",
    "for example , is the shell of a hermit crab part of the hermit crab even though the shell itself did now grow from it ?",
    "do essential bacteria that reside in larger organisms form part of that larger organism ? where is the line drawn between an organism and its environment ? throughout this paper , we assume that a process is only separate from the background in a behavioral sense .",
    "in fact , we assume processes are different from backgrounds in a physical sense only through resource management",
    ". we will demonstrate how these ontological questions are naturally prompted in our very abstract modeling environment .",
    "as mentioned already , we wish to investigate how complexity evolves over time when two processes compete for limited resources . we chose to represent competing processes by cellular automata as defined in the subsection below .",
    "cellular automata ( ca / cas ) represent a simple parallel computational paradigm that admit various analogies to processes in nature . in this section",
    ", we shall first introduce elementary cellular automata to justify how they are useful for modeling interacting and competing processes .",
    "we will consider _ elementary cellular automata _",
    "( eca / ecas ) which are simple and well - studied cas .",
    "they are defined to act on a one - dimensional discrete space divided into countably infinite many cells .",
    "we represent this space by a copy of the integers @xmath0 and refer to it as a _ tape _ or simply _ row_.    each cell in the tape can have a particular color . in the case of our ecas",
    "we shall work with just two colors , represented for example by @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "we sometimes call the distributions of @xmath1s and @xmath2s over the tape the _ output space _ or _ spatial configuration_. thus , we can represent an output space by a function @xmath3 from the integers @xmath0 to the set of colors , in this case @xmath4 . instead of writing @xmath5 , we shall often write @xmath6 and call @xmath6 the color of the @xmath7-th cell of row @xmath8 .",
    "an eca @xmath9 will act on such an output space in discrete time steps and as such can be seen as a function mapping functions to functions . in our case : @xmath10 if some eca @xmath9 acts on some initial row @xmath11 we will denote the output space after @xmath12 time - steps by @xmath13 so that @xmath14 . likewise , we will denote the @xmath15th cell at time @xmath12 by @xmath16 .",
    "our ecas are entirely defined in a local fashion in that the color @xmath17 of cell @xmath15 at time @xmath18 will only depend on @xmath16 and its two direct neighboring cells @xmath19 and @xmath19 ( in more general terminology , we only consider radius - one cas ( @xcite ) ) .",
    "thus , an eca @xmath9 with just two colors in the output space is entirely determined by its behavior on three adjacent cells .",
    "since each cell can only have two colors , there are @xmath20 such possible triplets so that there are @xmath21 possible different ecas .",
    "however , we will not consider all ecas for this experiment for computational simplicity .",
    "instead , we only consider the 88 eca that are non - equivalent under horizontal translation , 1 and 0 exchanges , or any combination of the two .      in our experiment , the entire interaction will be modeled by a particular ca that is a combination of two ecas and something else .",
    "so far we have decided to model a process @xmath22 by an eca @xmath9 with a color 0 ( white ) and a non - white color 1 .",
    "a process is modeled by the evolution of the white and non - white cells throughout time steps as governed by the particular eca rule .",
    "once we have made this choice , it is natural to consider a different process @xmath23 in a similar fashion .",
    "that is , we model @xmath23 also by an eca @xmath24 . to tell @xmath9 and @xmath24 apart on the same grid we choose @xmath24 to work on the alphabet @xmath25 whereas the alphabet of @xmath9 was @xmath26 .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath24 will use the same symbol 0 ( white ) .",
    "the next question is how to model the interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "we will do so by embedding both cas in a setting where we have a global ca @xmath27 with three colors @xmath28 .",
    "we will choose @xmath27 in such a fashion that @xmath27 restricted to the alphabet @xmath4 is just @xmath9 while @xmath27 restricted to the alphabet @xmath29 is @xmath24 .    of course these two requirements",
    "do not determine @xmath27 for given @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "thus , this leaves us with a difficult modeling choice reminiscent to the ontological question for organisms : what to do for triplets that contain all three colors or are otherwise not specified by @xmath9 or @xmath24 .",
    "since there are 12 such triplets , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "] we have @xmath41 different ways to define @xmath27 given @xmath9 and @xmath24 .",
    "given ecas @xmath9 and @xmath24 as above , we call any such @xmath27 that extends @xmath9 and @xmath24 a corresponding _ global rule_.",
    "since there are 88 unique ecas , there are 3916 unique combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath24 , which results in @xmath42 possible globals rules .",
    "an online program illustrating interacting cellular automata via a global rule can be visited at http://demonstrations.wolfram.com / competingcellularautomata/.      let us go back to the main purpose of the paper .",
    "we wish to study two competing processes that evolve over time and we want to measure how the complexity of the emerging patterns evolves as the two processes interact .",
    "the complexity of the emerging structures will be compared to the complexity of the respective processes as they would have evolved without interacting with each other .",
    "the structure of an experiment readily suggests itself .",
    "pick two ecas @xmath9 and @xmath24 defined on the alphabets @xmath26 and @xmath25 respectively . measure the typical complexities @xmath43 and @xmath44 generated by @xmath9 and @xmath24 respectively when they are applied in an isolated setting .",
    "next , pick some corresponding global rule @xmath27 and measure the typical complexity @xmath45 that is generated by @xmath27 .",
    "once this ` typical complexity ' is well - defined , the experiment can be run and @xmath45 can be compared to @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the question is how to interpret the results .",
    "if we see a change in the typical complexity there are three possible reasons this change can be attributed to :    1 .   an evolutionary process triggered by the interaction between @xmath9 and @xmath24",
    "an intrinsic complexity injection due the nature of how @xmath27 is defined on the 12 previously non - determined tuples ; 3 .",
    "an intrinsic complexity injection due to scaling the alphabet from size 2 to size 3 .    in case of the second reason , an analogy to the cosmological constant is readily suggested .",
    "recall that @xmath27 is supposed to take care of the modeling of the background so to say , where none of @xmath9 or @xmath24 is defined but only their interaction .",
    "thus , a possible increase of complexity / entropy is attributed in the second reason to some intrinsic entropy density of the background .",
    "we shall see how the choice of @xmath27 will affect the change of complexity upon interaction . before we can further describe the experiment",
    ", we first need to decide on how to measure complexity .      in @xcite a qualitative characterization of complexity",
    "is given for dynamical processes in general and ecas in particular .",
    "more specifically , wolfram described four classes for complexity which can be characterized as follows :    * class 1 .",
    "symbolic systems which rapidly converge to a uniform state .",
    "examples are eca rules 0 , 32 and 160 . *",
    "symbolic systems which rapidly converge to a repetitive or stable state .",
    "examples are eca rules 4 , 108 and 218 . * class 3 .",
    "symbolic systems which appear to remain in a random state .",
    "examples are eca rules 22 , 30 , 126 and 189 . *",
    "symbolic systems which form areas of repetitive or stable states , but which also form structures that interact with each other in complicated ways .",
    "examples are eca rules 54 and 110 .",
    "it turns out that one can consider a quantitative complexity measure that largely generalizes the four qualitative complexity classes as given by wolfram . in our definition of doing",
    "so we shall make use of de bruijn sequences @xmath46 although there are different approaches possible .    a _",
    "de bruijn _ sequence for n colors @xmath46 is any sequence @xmath47 of n colors so that any of the @xmath48 possible string of length @xmath49 with @xmath15 colors is actually a substring of @xmath47 . in this sense , de bruijn sequences are sometimes considered to be semi - random . using de bruijn sequences of increasing length for a fixed number of colors we can parametrize our input and as such it makes sense to speak of asymptotic behavior .",
    "now , one can formally characterize wolfram s classes in terms of kolmogorov complexity as was done in  @xcite . for large enough input @xmath7 and for a sufficiently long time evaluation @xmath12 one can use kolmogorov complexity to assign a complexity measure @xmath50 of a system @xmath9 for input @xmath7 and runtime @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) . a typical complexity measure for @xmath9",
    "can then be defined by :    @xmath51    as a first approximation , one can use cut - off values of these @xmath52 outcomes to classify @xmath9 into one of the four wolfram classes .      in the experiment we tested the influence of global rules ( grs ) @xmath27 on two interacting ecas @xmath9 and @xmath24 . of the @xmath53 possible",
    "grs we explored a total number of @xmath54 grs representing a share of 80% .    for each combination of the two ecas @xmath9 and @xmath24 with one gr",
    ", we considered 100 different initial conditions of length 26 corresponding to the first 100 ( in the canonical enumeration order ) de bruijn sequences of this length over the alphabet @xmath28 .",
    "each execution was evaluated for 60 timesteps .",
    "we use the method described in section [ section : complexitycharacterization ] to determine the complexity of a ca state evolution for two ecas with mixed neighborhoods evolving under a gr .",
    "specifically , we used the _ mathematica _",
    "v. 10.0 ` compress ` function as an approximation of the kolmogorov complexity   as first suggested in  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note the number of computational hours it took to undergo this experiment . for @xmath54",
    "grs each exploring 100 different initial conditions and @xmath55 combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath24 , there were a total of @xmath56 billion ca executions .",
    "even with one numerical value per ca execution , the total data generated for this experiment was 1.3 terabytes on hard drive .",
    "about @xmath57 hours of computational time were used total on about 200 jobs at a time , each gr on a different core , which was 200 grs .",
    "sometimes up to 500 jobs in parallel .",
    "each job took about 36 hours to complete .    each complexity estimate",
    "@xmath43 is normalized by subtracting the compression value of a string of 0 s of equal length . for most of the ca instances ,",
    "this is a good approximation of the long - term effects of a gr .",
    "as mentioned in section [ section : complexitycharacterization ] we can use these compression values to determine / approximate wolfram s complexity classes according to critical thresholds values .",
    "the thresholds were trained according to the ecas we used for the interactions .    using these compression methods for each run",
    ", we determined if the output was class 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 .",
    "the outcome is organized according to the complexity classes of the constituent cas .",
    "for the best clarity , the results are represented in heat maps in the next section .",
    "each output class ( 1 - 4 ) is represented by its own heat map , so each figure will have four heat maps to account for the different classes of outputs .",
    "each map is composed of a four - by - four grid whose axes describe the complexity classes of @xmath9 and @xmath24 , as shown .",
    "thus , of all of the runs ( ecas @xmath9 and @xmath24 interaction , gr @xmath27 , and initial condition ) that yield a class 1 output are represented under the heat map labeled _ class 1_. for example , in figure 1 , about 11% of all class 1 outputs were generated by class 1 @xmath9 and class 1 @xmath24 interactions . here the more intense color represents the more densely populated value for a particular class .",
    "the outputs of every possible @xmath54 grs are accumulated and represented in figure 1 . in general",
    ", this figure shows the change in complexity when a gr is used to determine the interaction between two ecas .",
    "most of the outputs for each complexity class were generated with class 1 eca interactions , which was least expected .",
    "there are several interesting examples of grs that affect the classification of behavior of the ca interaction state output .",
    "the heat maps of three grs in particular are shown in figures 2 - 4 .",
    "as shown in the figure captions , grs are enumerated according to their position in the ` tuples ` function .",
    "that is to say , we enumerate the grs by generating all tuples with 3 symbols in lexicographical order .    over half of all outputs from with gr 77399",
    "were complexity class 4 from class 1 @xmath9 and @xmath24 interactions . the majority of complexity class 3 outputs were generated from complexity class 2 @xmath9 and @xmath24 interactions .",
    "gr 72399 had outputs that were 65 the actual outputs for some of these grs are shown in figure 5 .",
    "note that most @xmath9 and @xmath24 rules are complexity class 1 or 2 .",
    "it is unexpected that the biggest increases in complexity arise from @xmath9 and @xmath24 complexity class 1 interactions .",
    "this suggests that complexity is intrinsic to the grs rather than the ecas themselves .",
    "we suspect that interacting class 1 ecas readily accept complexity through the rules of their interactions .",
    "this is not as prevalent in any of the other complexity classes of @xmath9 and @xmath24 interactions .",
    "likely , if @xmath9 and @xmath24 have more complexity without interaction , then they are more robust to any complexity changes introduced by the gr .    in all cases , complexity increases or",
    "remains the same by introducing an interaction rule via a gr .",
    "the most interesting cases are when global rules increase the complexity of the output by entire classes .",
    "there are cases where mixed neighborhoods are present and sustained throughout the output , which is a form of emergence through the interaction gr rule . because we only used a short number of time steps per execution , it is unclear whether these mixed neighborhoods eventually die out or not , it is nonetheless a case of intermediate emergence from a global rule .",
    "we have found interesting cases where global rules seem to drastically change the complexity of an interacting ca output . some originally class 3 ecas , for example ,",
    "were found to be too fragile under most global rules , while some other are more resilient .",
    "most importantly , the greatest increases in complexity occur when the interacting eca are both class 1 , which is true for the majority of all possible global rules .",
    "although we still have yet to understand the mechanisms behind these results , we are confident that further analysis will be important in understanding the emergence of complex structures .",
