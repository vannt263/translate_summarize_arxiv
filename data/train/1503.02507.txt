    "<S> there is also evidence that the indicators of quantum chaos related to the statistical properties of the hamiltonian s eigenspectrum  @xcite change abruptly when infinitesimally breaking integrability . </S>",
    "<S> however , thermalization of a closed system is a dynamical process . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the dynamics toward the final thermal state in nearly integrable systems seems to be more rich and subtle than the dichotomic situation present in the static results . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is well known that systems close to an integrable point may exhibit non - thermal stationary states , both in one dimension ( @xmath0 ) and in higher dimensions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such metastable states emerge as a result of a fast lost of memory of the initial conditions due to dephasing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of such non - thermal stationary states has been observed experimentally in cold atomic bose gases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quite interestingly , dephasing alone may lead to complete thermalization of some observables , such as the kinetic energy of the system , a phenomenon dubbed prethermalization in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , little is known about the subsequent evolution of the system after getting caught in such metastable states , in part due to the formidable technical challenge that poses the out - of - equilibrium dynamics of many - body quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , simple questions such as how much do these stationary states live or which are the relevant timescales involved in the thermalization process has no definitive answer yet .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the dynamics of a system of @xmath0 spinless fermions near the xxz integrable point while varying the distance to integrability and the energy of the system . </S>",
