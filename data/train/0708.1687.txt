    "understanding the mechanism of confinement in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a fundamental but elusive challenge .",
    "lattice calculations convincingly demonstrate that qcd yields confinement , but do not yet elucidate its mechanism .",
    "although the strong coupling expansion produces an area law by disorder already in lowest order , this disorder alone is not the whole story as evidenced by the fact that the strong coupling expansion also erroneously yields confinement in u(1 ) gauge theory .",
    "hence , in this work , we develop a confining effective theory based on degrees of freedom arising naturally from qcd .",
    "we explore in detail how confinement arises , and the degree to which this effective theory approximates the results of su(2 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "there has been a long and fruitful history of seeking to understand nonperturbative qcd analytically by expanding the path integral for the partition function around stationary classical solutions and evaluating the fluctuations around these solutions .",
    "central to this approach was the discovery of instantons @xcite that satisfy the classical euclidean yang - mills equations and implement the tunneling required between different winding number sectors of the @xmath0 vacuum .",
    "since instantons can be transformed to the singular gauge in which the gauge field falls off like @xmath1 , a dilute gas of these instantons is an approximate solution to the field equations .",
    "the contribution of this dilute instanton gas to the potential between two static color charges can be calculated analytically , and was shown not to produce confinement @xcite . whereas an instanton that contributes to two opposite wilson lines in a wilson loop does contribute to a linear term to the potential , when the integral over color orientations of independent instantons that affect only one or the other wilson line is performed , these uncorrelated contributions do not produce a linear term . hence at separation larger than the instanton size , the potential becomes a constant and fails to confine .",
    "when instantons failed to produce confinement , there was then hope that merons @xcite , solutions to the yang - mills equations with topological charge 1/2 , would do so .",
    "although a free meron has an action that diverges logarithmically with the volume , a pair of merons has a finite action that depends logarithmically on the separation . if the coupling is strong enough that the logarithmic potential is weaker than the entropy associated with the euclidean separation ( @xmath2 ) , meron pairs could dissociate and form a meron gas .",
    "since meron fields only fall off as @xmath3 , they are expected to be more effective in disordering than singular gauge instantons and thus potentially be a more effective mechanism for confinement @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the same @xmath3 behavior that makes them a candidate for confinement renders them intractable analytically , and as a result they have never been shown by analytic arguments to be responsible for confinement .    motivated by the quark",
    "zero modes associated with instantons and the t  hooft interaction governing light quarks , highly successful instanton liquid models , which had to be implemented numerically , were developed that provide clear insight into the role instantons play in chiral symmetry breaking and reproduce many of the salient features of qcd with light quarks @xcite . for our present purposes ,",
    "it is best to think of an instanton liquid as an effective theory in which one parameterizes a set of gauge configurations in terms of the positions and color orientations of an ensemble of instantons to represent the salient degrees of freedom for gluons . because the field equations are nonlinear , the superposition of a set of instanton solutions is not a classical solution to the field equations .",
    "hence , rather than summing over a set of classical solutions , one is approximating the original functional integral for the partition function over gauge fields by performing the integral over these effective degrees of freedom , for example by using the metropolis algorithm to sample configurations .",
    "physically , this sampling will favor the appropriate configurations that are energetically and entropically optimal .",
    "because the gauge fields of singular gauge instantons fall off as @xmath1 , a random instanton liquid in which the positions and color orientations of instantons are chosen randomly does not differ qualitatively from one generated by more sophisticated metropolis sampling , so most of the qualitative phenomena occur in a random instanton liquid .",
    "as in the case of the dilute instanton gas , wilson loops in a random instanton liquid also show no confinement at distances larger than the instanton size .",
    "in the present work , we consider a more general class of effective theories based on ensembles of regular gauge instantons or merons , whose fields fall off like @xmath3 , so that the resulting superposition of gauge fields is not close to a classical solution . throughout this work",
    ", we will refer to regular gauge instantons or merons as _",
    "pseudoparticles_. the term _ instanton _ will always mean a regular gauge instanton , and if we wish to refer to a singular gauge instanton , we will always do so explicitly .",
    "although it is analytically intractable to perform the resulting integral of the partition function over the pseudoparticle collective coordinates , it is straightforward to do so numerically using the metropolis algorithm . whereas most random choices of pseudoparticle fields create a large background field yielding an unphysically high action density",
    ", metropolis sampling selects the particular configurations in which the collective coordinates are correlated in such a way as to produce very low action density . in this way",
    ", one can achieve the balance of energy and entropy in ensembles based on regular gauge pseudoparticles that is conceptually equivalent to what has been done in the past with singular gauge instantons .",
    "this more general class of theories based on pseudoparticles combines both confinement and the successes of previous singular gauge instanton liquid models .",
    "as will be shown below , color correlations are required to superpose the long range pseudoparticle gauge fields to create the small background fields whose low action allows them to dominate the path integral .",
    "these also produce the correlations necessary to yield an area law for large wilson loops and thus produce confinement .",
    "the short distance  spikes \" in the gluon field arising from the short distance behavior of small merons or instantons behave just like the spikes in conventional singular gauge instanton liquid models , and thus produce the physics associated with the t  hooft interaction and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "pseudoparticle ensembles were first used by the present authors to study meron ensembles @xcite , where there is no singular gauge alternative . however , in the context we have just described , it is clear that one should also consider regular gauge instantons . indeed , since the gauge for each instanton is defined relative to its position , the fields obtained by superposing @xmath4 singular gauge instantons is drastically different from the one obtained by transforming each of these instantons to the regular gauge and superposing the resulting fields . neither is a classical solution of the yang - mills equations , and neither is preferred on physical grounds .",
    "hence , in exploring the full physics based on classical solutions , it is essential to study both alternatives . although we will not develop it further in this work , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses how one may expect center symmetry to be realized in pseudoparticle effective theories . a closely related effective theory @xcite superposes pseudoparticle fields with dynamically determined amplitudes and generalizes to finite temperature , where a clear crossover in the polyakov loop is observed from a nearly vanishing value at zero temperature to a magnitude close to unity at high temperature .",
    "the primary goals of this work are to understand the mechanism by which this effective theory produces confinement and other observed properties of su(2 ) gauge theory , and explore its success and limitations in quantitatively approximating the results of lattice qcd calculations of the action density , topological susceptibility , and glueball masses .",
    "although we will discuss both instanton and meron pseudoparticles in detail and give extensive examples for both , the primary focus in comparing with the lattice qcd spectrum is on the confining instanton theory .",
    "we will show that the confining instanton theory has essentially all the advantages of previous random and interacting singular gauge instanton models , with the added feature of incorporating confinement . to obtain insight into the effective pseudoparticle theory",
    ", we will strongly emphasize analytic arguments wherever possible , as indicated in the outline below .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the details of the pseudoparticle ensembles and some relevant analytical properties .",
    "in particular , since one might be concerned that the long range fields of pseudoparticles are necessarily large , we present a simple example of how sets of merons can be chosen such that the leading order @xmath5 term in the action at large distances vanishes identically .",
    "section 3 describes random and correlated pseudoparticle ensembles . for pedagogical purposes ,",
    "we begin with an ensemble in which the pseudoparticle positions and color orientations are selected randomly without correlations .",
    "although this ensemble has unphysical features , it enables us to make instructive analytical arguments .",
    "we then allow metropolis dynamics to produce the appropriate color and spatial correlations .",
    "the resulting gauge fields are shown to have a proper thermodynamic limit and to be composed of small background fields plus  spikes \" at the locations of pseudoparticles . by separately applying metropolis dynamics to only color parameters and",
    "then both color and spatial parameters , we show that the dominant correlations are in the color degrees of freedom .",
    "section 4 addresses wilson loops and confinement .",
    "when scaled appropriately , wilson loops are shown to lie on a universal scaling curve , which is nearly independent of the pseudoparticle size and the coupling constant and which shows a clear area law indicating confinement .",
    "the behavior of wilson loops in both the small size and large size limits is explained analytically .",
    "we also show that the distribution of wilson loops follows the diffusion behavior of ref .",
    "@xcite and that wilson loops in higher representations exhibit casimir scaling , both of which are in agreement with lattice qcd .",
    "section 5 presents calculations of physical observables .",
    "since the theory is confining , we can set the scale by the measured string tension and compare unambiguously with lattice calculations in which observables are also specified in terms of the measured string tension .",
    "the two most robust observables are the gluon condensate and the topological susceptibility , and both instanton and meron ensembles are shown to yield values in units of the string tension in qualitative agreement with lattice qcd .",
    "we show that for many operators of interest , the effective theory produces euclidean correlation functions with the proper physical behavior .",
    "the correlation function of the topological charge density displays the proper negativity behavior , and operators constructed from field - strengths and wilson loops enable us to measure the masses of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 glueball states . aside from an overall scale factor which we discuss",

    "having adjusted the overall scale , we note that the masses of the @xmath6 , @xmath10 and @xmath153 glueballs of the two spectra agree within 5% while the mass of the @xmath9 state is 25% larger than the lattice value .",

    "the average excitation energy of the lattice results is 1.8 .      in this concluding paragraph of our studies of correlation functions , we will return to the issue of confinement in the pseudoparticle ensembles .",
    "the physics of confinement is intimately related to the formation of flux - tubes or gauge strings and one may wonder whether the area law found in the fit to the wilson loops indeed implies that such a mechanism is operative also in the pseudoparticle ensembles . to study the dynamics of wilson loops we follow the investigations in @xcite and calculate correlation function of loops with fixed orientation .",
    "we assume circular loops of equal radius which are parallel to each other and orthogonal to the direction of separation .",
    "we do not perform any averaging , i.e. , we calculate the following correlators [ cf .",
    "( [ wlc1 ] ) ] @xmath155    the results of the calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ grogf ] .",
    "if one assumes that the application of the wilson loop operator to the vacuum generates a gauge string with ( approximate ) energy @xmath156 the relevant variable for describing the correlation function is @xmath157 . as fig .",
    "[ grogf ] shows , the three correlation functions are described approximatively by a universal curve in terms of this variable .",
    "it thus appears that the dynamics in the pseudoparticle ensembles is compatible with the formation of gauge strings or flux tubes .",
    "the existence of such a universal curve offers the possibility for an alternative determination of the string tension . due to the limited range of values a direct extraction of the string tension",
    "is not possible .",
    "we have parameterized the distributions by @xmath158 from the fit to the correlation functions of the wilson loops shown in the right part of fig .",
    "[ grogf ] we obtain @xmath159 the small range of relevant values of the variable @xmath157 does not permit a more precise determination of @xmath160 .",
    "the value ( [ sigco ] ) of the string tension agrees within 20% with that derived from the asymptotics of the wilson loops ( cf .",
    "( [ stp2i ] ) and ( [ stringas ] ) ) .    at large separations",
    "the universality breaks down as expected .",
    "for @xmath161 it becomes energetically favorable for the system of two loops to couple by annihilation of the gauge string to the vacuum or glueball states .",
    "this corresponds to the gross - ooguri phase transition in the large @xmath162 limit @xcite .",
    "the effective theories with pseudoparticle degrees of freedom studied in this work describe important properties of qcd .",
    "the regular gauge instantons or the merons with their long - range gauge fields apparently constitute a proper and economical set of degrees of freedom in the description of the yang - mills dynamics in the infrared . by superposition of these building blocks , field configurations are generated with confinement as an inherent property .",
    "an area law for sufficiently large wilson loops is already obtained in ( stochastic ) ensembles with the same weight assigned to all field configurations .",
    "however such ensembles violate basic principles .",
    "the action of field configurations in such ensembles is diverging in the infrared , concomitantly the ensembles do not possess a proper thermodynamic limit and violate translational invariance . by assigning the standard weight given by the action to the field configurations ,",
    "all these problems are cured at once and confinement is preserved .",
    "the resulting configurations not only confine static color charges but also the building blocks themselves . only at the expense of a logarithmically diverging action",
    "can a building block be removed to infinity .",
    "the pseudoparticles are strongly correlated over large distances in order to prevent a logarithmic rise in the action ( for this reason a global update procedure had to be employed in our computations ) . on the other hand with its many spikes and valleys in color singlet quantities like the action density or the topological susceptibility , single field configurations appear strongly disordered .",
    "thus , in our investigations , a picture of the yang - mills vacuum emerges which is that of a nematic substance  a medium that is strongly correlated in color or `` director '' space ( @xmath163 and @xmath164 respectively ) and which at the same time is essentially disordered in configuration space ( cf .",
    "this picture summarizes our findings . on the one hand ,",
    "updates of the randomly chosen coordinates of the pseudoparticles in addition to the color update have no significant effect . on the other hand , a color disordered ensemble such as the stochastic ensemble we have studied does not produce a qualitatively correct model of the yang - mills vacuum",
    ". clearly , the color correlations in meron and instanton ensembles are at the heart of the phenomenon of confinement .",
    "when a singular gauge instanton contributes to 2 polyakov lines , it produces a linear potential , while singular instantons affecting one polyakov line only are irrelevant .",
    "the last part of this argument @xcite gets modified in our context . due to the strong color correlations ,",
    "single instantons still contribute to the potential .",
    "in addition to confinement of static charges , the color correlated fields reproduce remarkably well other important features of the yang - mills dynamics .",
    "they exhibit proper scaling under variations of the number of pseudoparticles or the size of the system and they reproduce qualitatively characteristic properties such as the values of the gluon condensate and the topological susceptibility . unlike the gluon condensate , the value of the topological susceptibility can be related to the single pseudoparticle properties .",
    "we also have been able to investigate finer details and for instance to show analytically that characteristic properties of the wilson loops in the limits of small and large size , i.e. , the u(1 ) and the string limit , are qualitatively reproduced . here the role of the pseudoparticle size as an effective ultraviolet regulator is essential .",
    "we also qualitatively confirmed the string picture for wilson loop correlation functions and thus obtained a significant consistency check of the description of confinement in term of pseudoparticles .",
    "the outcome of our investigations of correlation functions is more ambiguous .",
    "we have demonstrated the emergence of a hadronic scale under the usual circumstances where the size of the building blocks is smaller than the emerging size of the `` many - body '' hadron . in the case of merons with their long range field - strength",
    "the opposite mechanism is at work and establishes a hadronic size smaller than the constituent meron size . to study hadronic excitations ,",
    "we have computed momentum projected correlators of local gauge invariant operators with definite angular momentum built from field - strength bilinears and trilinears and have also calculated correlation functions of momentum and angular momentum projected wilson loops . with these computations , we have been able to determine the spectrum of glueballs with quantum numbers @xmath165 and @xmath166 . while the structure of the spectrum agrees qualitatively with the corresponding lattice results , the masses determined are too small by an overall factor of about 2 for both instanton and meron ensembles .",
    "we have not been able to uniquely identify the origin of this difficulty .",
    "ambiguities in the determination of the string constant are unlikely to explain it",
    ". a smaller value deduced from the fit to the wilson loop would , after identification with the empirical value , result in a higher energy scale .",
    "there is indeed some freedom left by redefinition of the relevant interval of the area of the loops .",
    "a change of the order of 20% can not be ruled out entailing a @xmath167 change in the energy scale .",
    "corrections of a similar order of magnitude seem to result when using a `` smeared '' wilson loop @xcite .",
    "neither effect however approaches the necessary factor of 4 in the string tension .",
    "the most likely explanation is that with the pseudoparticle ensembles primarily determined by infrared properties , the ultraviolet fluctuations are not adequately described . for a description of an object like the scalar glueball with a size of approximately @xmath168 fm @xcite the spatial resolution of our field configurations  possibly limited by a too `` small '' number of pseudoparticles",
    " may just be insufficient . in our discussion of small size wilson loops",
    "we indeed have noticed the disappearance of the `` coulomb regime '' with the disappearance of the disorder in color space . to cure this problem",
    "one would have to either significantly enlarge the number of pseudoparticles or to introduce additional degrees of freedom which improve the description of the vacuum at small scales .",
    "candidates for such additional degrees of freedom are singular gauge instantons which are the center reflected partners of the regular gauge instantons .",
    "inclusion of these degrees of freedom would , by construction , avoid the otherwise problematic issue of multiple counting of gauge copies .",
    "in addition to such improvements in the description of the yang - mills theory , for phenomenological applications quarks have to be incorporated . here",
    "the advantages of the continuum formulation of the effective pseudoparticle theories could be essential .",
    "first steps in this endeavor have been taken @xcite .",
    "here one aims to take over the successful treatment of the dynamics of quarks in the instanton liquid model @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal would be to establish in this way an effective theory that exhibits the two nonperturbative basic phenomena of qcd  confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
