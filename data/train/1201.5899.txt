    "understanding how collisionless systems attain a specific mechanical equilibrium state is fundamentally important to astrophysics .",
    "for example , the cold dark matter structures that exist around galaxies are expected to fall into this class of system .",
    "individual dark matter constituents ( whatever they may be ) should evolve according to a mean - field gravitational potential , free of the influence of individual encounters .",
    "the range of mechanical equilibria available to a collisionless system is defined by the jeans equation , which represents the condition that no portion of the system experiences a net force .",
    "unfortunately , the jeans equation admits an infinity of solutions .",
    "even if the mass distribution is specified , there is an infinite set of acceptable mechanical equilibria , each involving a different velocity distribution . for spherical systems ,",
    "these velocity distributions differ in their anisotropy profile that quantifies radial versus tangential motion .",
    "however , the question remains , how and/or why does any one collisionless system evolve to its particular mechanical equilibrium end - state , and what are the properties of such a state ?",
    "the statistical mechanics description of thermodynamics provides one path to obtaining the description of the final relaxed state .",
    "a fully relaxed system is the most statistically likely state of that system , or the one with an entropy maximum .",
    "in calculating the most likely state it is implicitly assumed that all states of the system are equally accessible .",
    "such an approach was taken by @xcite and applied to self - gravitating collisionless systems , with the hope of explaining the observed light distribution of elliptical galaxies .",
    "a collisionless system can be thought of as a fluid in the 6d phase - space of position and velocity .",
    "the ` particles ' in lynden - bell s analysis are parcels of phase - space , _",
    "i.e. , _  parcels of this fluid , and so the distribution function ( df ) representing the phase - space density is defined in terms of energy per unit mass , not energy per particle .",
    "the analysis resulted in a df similar to the fermi - dirac case , but with a different normalization .",
    "@xcite argued that a non - degenerate limit is appropriate for stellar systems , and thus arrived at a df similar to that of the maxwell - boltzmann case ( an exponential ) which resulted in the isothermal sphere representing thermal equilibrium . since the isothermal sphere has an infinite extent and mass , its emergence from the entropy maximization procedure , which demanded a finite mass system , presented a contradiction .",
    "this apparent failure of entropy maximization was puzzling , and it was often argued that such systems do not have states of maximum entropy .",
    "some effort was made to investigate maximizing entropy with additional constraints beyond mass , energy , and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "other routes involving minimum energy states of self - gravitating systems were also developed ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "recently , @xcite ( based on earlier work by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has pointed out that the reason for the system s infinite mass was the use of the stirling approximation , @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to systems usually treated in standard statistical mechanics , self - gravitating systems can apparently have small phase - space occupation numbers @xmath2 , making stirling a poor approximation .",
    "specifically , these systems have regions of phase - space or energy - space that are nearly or completely unoccupied , such that @xmath2 will be small .",
    "spatially , these regions can correspond to the center of the potential as well as its outer edge . using maxwell - boltzmann statistics and the exact @xmath3 ,",
    "@xcite has found a distribution function from entropy maximization that is very similar to @xcite models .",
    "@xcite have shown that the energy - space occupation function @xmath4 derived using a very accurate smooth approximation to @xmath3 closely resembles the results of collisionless @xmath5-body simulations @xcite .      from a statistical point of view , entropy is simply a measurement of the number of states accessible to a particular system .",
    "this relationship is most commonly expressed quantitatively as , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of accessible states and @xmath8  is the boltzmann constant which serves to give entropy the correct thermodynamic units . as a result , counting procedures are key to determining specific realizations of entropy .",
    "@xcite discusses how there are four counting types that lead to physically relevant situations .",
    "bose - einstein statistics follow from counting states for indistinguishable particles that can co - habitate in the same state . when indistinguishable particles are not allowed to share states , fermi - dirac ( fd )",
    "statistics emerge .",
    "classical maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) statistics result from counting states available to distinguishable particles that can share states . completing the symmetry , systems where distinguishable ` particles'actually , parcels of phase - space  cannot co - occupy states obey what has become known as lynden - bell ( lb ) statistics ( statistics ` iv ' in lynden - bell s original notation ) .",
    "each type of statistics will produce different representations of entropy , but we will focus on the two that deal with classical , or distinguishable particles , namely , lb and mb .    we briefly recap the notation used in @xcite before proceeding with our discussion .",
    "the six - dimensional position - velocity phase - space ( @xmath9,@xmath10 ) is the usual setting for determining the statistics .",
    "imagine phase - space to be divided into a very large number of nearly infinitesimal parcels , called micro - cells , each having volume @xmath11 .",
    "each micro - cell can either be occupied or unoccupied by one of the @xmath5 phase - space elements of the system .",
    "these elements can be thought of as representing the fine - grained distribution function , which has a constant density value @xmath12 . because collisionless processes imply incompressibility of the fine - grained distribution function , the phase elements can not co - habitate .",
    "if phase - space is also partitioned on a coarser level so that some number @xmath13 of micro - cells occupy a macro - cell , then we can discuss a coarse - grained distribution function .",
    "the volume of a macro - cell is then @xmath14 and the @xmath15th macro - cell contains @xmath16 phase elements .",
    "we assume that while the volume of a macro - cell is much larger than that of a micro - cell , it is still very small compared to the full extent of phase - space occupied by the system .",
    "the number of ways of organizing the @xmath16 elements into the @xmath13 micro - cells without co - habitation is , @xmath17 if the elements were allowed to multiply occupy micro - cells , as in mb statistics , this number would be given by @xmath18 .",
    "to get the total number of accessible states , the possible ways to distribute the @xmath5 phase elements into @xmath16 chunks must also be included .",
    "@xcite derives , @xmath19 in the mb case , the only change is that the factorial ratio in the final product term is replaced by @xmath18 .",
    "the lb case disallows two phase - space elements from inhabiting the same phase - space location , so it explicitly takes into account the incompressibility of a collisionless fluid .",
    "since we are primarily interested in dark matter halos , lb is the natural case to consider . for completeness , and for the sake of having a comparison",
    ", we also treat the mb case , in the appendix .",
    "we argue that the lack of an exclusion principle in the mb case is equivalent to allowing collisions between particles . in a collisional system",
    ", particles from distant phase - space locations can be scattered into any other phase - space location , thereby increasing the phase - space density at the latter location . in principle , there is no limit to how high the density can get through such scatterings . in practice ,",
    "the phase - space density probably can not become very high at most locations , but it can be higher than the original fine - grained df .",
    "we note that it is common to use mb to represent collisional systems .",
    "for example , @xcite argues that it is the correct statistics to use for globular clusters where the relatively small number of stars allows the cluster to relax through two - body interactions .",
    "it then makes sense that the energy distribution that the cluster will arrive at will be the same as that in a cloud of gas , which relaxes through collisions between molecules . in the non - degenerate limit",
    ", when the micro - cells are very sparsely populated and the density of the coarse - grained distribution function is very dilute compared to that of the fine - grained function , both lb and mb distribution functions , and hence density profiles , will look the same .      in this paper",
    "we explore two possible approaches to deriving the final equilibrium state of self - gravitating systems , for each of the two types of statistics , lb and mb . in both",
    ", we use a very accurate , smooth approximation for @xmath0 valid for arbitrary occupation numbers @xmath20 . however , the price we pay for this improved approximation is the loss of analytic solutions .",
    "the first approach assumes that the final state is the maximum entropy state , an assumption that was first used in the context of self - gravitating systems in 1950 s @xcite . the second approach , again in the context of self - gravitating systems , was first taken by @xcite ; it posits that the final state corresponds to the extremum of entropy production rate .",
    "we explore extremizing entropy production because it has not been established beyond a doubt that real or computer simulated systems do fully relax to maximum entropy states .",
    "it is possible that their steady - state configurations do not correspond to maximum entropy .",
    "prior work on thermal non - equilibrium systems , but not in astrophysical contexts , suggests that stationary states  like mechanical equilibrium  occur when entropy production is extremized ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate their applicability to self - gravitating systems in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the new aspect in the present paper is that we use a very accurate approximation for @xmath0 , unlike our previous paper that assumed the stirling approximation .",
    "as @xcite has shown , replacing stirling with an accurate approximation ( i ) results in systems with finite total mass and energy , and ( ii ) significantly changes the structure of the systems .    in all",
    ", we present four derivations ; entropy maximization for the lb and mb statistics are covered in sections  [ lbsmax ] and  [ smax ] .",
    "extremization of entropy production for lb and mb statistics are carried out in sections  [ lbsigma ] and  [ sigmax ] , respectively .",
    "we develop expressions for the relaxation functions ( see   [ recap ] ) , and use these to better understand the evolution of coarse - grained distribution function .",
    "we compare our results with analogous versions of entropy production derived using the standard stirling approximation in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ tblfig ] puts the present paper ( bwii in the figure ) in context .",
    "it is a schematic summary of the various statistical mechanical approaches to self - gravitating systems .",
    "the possible ways to frame the problem appears at the top of the figure ; one can formulate the problem in either the regular phase - space , or the energy space .",
    "below the thick horizontal line we show the two different routes for attaining the final steady - state state : maximizing entropy , and extremizing entropy production .",
    "once these choices are made one has to decide whether small occupation number regime will be important or not , and hence whether to use the stirling approximation for @xmath21 , or not . in the latter case , one",
    "must then decide whether to use the discrete ( `` discr . '' ) step - like , i.e. exact version of @xmath22 , or to approximate it with some smooth function ( `` cont . '' ) which remains very accurate down to small @xmath20 .",
    "note that hw10 and the present paper use different but similar approximations .",
    "there is no physical reason to introduce the exclusion principle in the energy state - space , hence the corresponding regions are marked as `` not relevant '' .",
    "the bottom entries of some columns in the table contain names of papers where the corresponding options were considered .",
    "k66 in parentheses below bwii means that @xcite results are nearly identical to ours .",
    "@xmath23 under lb67 means that @xcite final result , the isothermal sphere , had infinite mass .",
    "much of the background material for this work may be found in @xcite , and we briefly summarize these previously obtained results in section  [ recap ] .",

    "the relaxation function simply describes the lagrangian time rate of change of the distribution function . returning to our case where @xmath29 represents the coarse - grained df , equation  [ boltzeqn ] states that entropy is produced [ and as we argue in @xcite it happens even in systems that have attained macroscopic steady - state ] because on microscopic scales the fine - grained df continues to wind and twist , which when combined with coarse - graining , gives rise to non - zero entropy change . from a different starting point",

    "we follow the overall path taken in @xcite to determine the description of entropy for the lb statistics family . briefly , counting arguments for phase - space macro - cell occupation are combined with the statistical definition of entropy to give specific representations .",
    "variations in entropy assuming constant mass and energy are then set to zero in order to determine the necessary distribution functions .    if one demands that multiple phase - space elements can not simultaneously occupy micro - cells , the multiplicity of states ( equation  [ lbw ] ) combined with the definition of entropy results in , @xmath41,\\ ] ] where again the summations run over the number of macro - cells .",

    "the value of @xmath13 appears to play a role analogous to the king scaling factor @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a relative potential energy at the center , and @xmath24 is an energy scaling constant @xcite . increasing @xmath13or @xmath98increases the concentration of the system .",

    "we have begun to explore the possibility that the mechanical equilibria of simulated collisionless systems can be explained as states of extreme entropy production .    to this end , we have derived expressions for entropy production in collisionless systems using the lynden - bell statistics , and in collisional systems , using maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "further , we have found the form of the relaxation function required to guarantee an entropy production extreme .",
    "recall that the relaxation function is the right - hand side of the boltzmann equation , equation  [ boltzeqn ] , that describes the coarse - grained distribution function evolution .    as in our previous work which was valid only for large phase - space occupation numbers ,",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann relaxation function ( pictured in figure  [ mbrelax ] ) is positive for all values of @xmath65 ( as long as @xmath100 ) and becomes more constant as the number of particles @xmath5 increases .",
    "it is clear that the basic form of the relaxation function is not dependent on the specifics of the distribution function .",
    "a visual comparison between figure  [ mbrelax ] and figure 1 in @xcite reinforces this point .",
    "the general form of the lynden - bell relaxation function shown in figure  [ lbrelax ] has similarities and differences with its large occupation number version derived in @xcite .",
    "the similarities are that both the functions increase with @xmath68 up to just short of @xmath101 , then spike towards large positive values of @xmath102 , go through a singularity at @xmath103 , then become negative , and eventually asymptote to @xmath104 as @xmath105 ( see the bottom panel of figure  [ lbrelax ] ) .",
    "the difference is that the large occupation number @xmath102 is independent of @xmath13 , while its arbitrary occupation number analogue is not . in the latter case",
    "the values of @xmath27 and @xmath13 that produce the singularity are linked through the relationship , @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the minimum value of @xmath13 that will cause a singularity for a given @xmath27 .",
    "this expression is valid as long as @xmath108 .",
    "the importance of the singularity in both cases is that it signals that the relaxation function will reach zero when the coarse - grained distribution function @xmath29 reaches the fine - grained value @xmath12 , bringing the evolution of the distribution function to a halt .    to sum up",
    ", extremizing entropy production in the lb case leads to a relaxation function @xmath102 vs. @xmath68 shape that drives @xmath102 , and hence the entropy production rate @xmath109 , to zero , which in turn means that the endpoint of evolution has a maximum ( more correctly , an extremum ) entropy .",
    "in other words , the entropy production extremization procedure that we followed in section  [ lbsigma ] tell us that the final state of a self - gravitating collisionless system is a state of maximum entropy .",
    "since in section  [ lbsmax ] we derived such a state , using entropy maximization , it must be the same state .",
    "the important point in both the lb and the mb case is that extremizing entropy production leads to relaxation functions that drive a coarse - grained distribution function to behave like a fine - grained distribution function .",
    "this has a bearing on the ` incompleteness of relaxation ' , sometimes alluded to when describing stationary - state collisionless systems .",
    "our results suggest that if incomplete relaxation does happen , it is not due to a system reaching an entropy production extreme .",
    "rather , it appears that coarse - grained evolution will proceed until entropy production ceases , when @xmath32 , and so full relaxation will be achieved in self - gravitating systems . as an immediate consequence",
    "we conclude that entropy maximization is the correct  and more direct  procedure to take to arrive at the description of steady - state self - gravitating systems .",
    "to test the hypothesis that for self - gravitating systems the state of entropy production extreme coincides with the state of maximum entropy , we are undertaking a comparison between these analytical descriptions of entropy behavior in collisionless systems and results of @xmath5-body and semi - analytical simulations ( _ e.g. , _",
    "the extended secondary infall model esim * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". this further work will help settle exactly what role entropy production plays in determining collisionless equilibria .",
    "aside from the future work described above , to quantify entropy production rate in simulated numerical systems , there are also a few questions that remain unanswered .",
    "@xcite and the present paper maximized entropy , but in different state - spaces , energy and @xmath110 phase - space , respectively .",
    "the results of the two studies , for example in terms of the density profiles , are very different from each other .",
    "it is not surprising that they are different , but it is not immediately obvious which one of the two approaches would produce a better description of the results of collisionless n - body simulations . after looking at all the density profiles it is seen that @xcite profiles are similar to those of simulated systems @xcite , while those from the lb case in the present work ( section  [ lbsmax ] , figures  [ rho_lb ] and  [ lbcomp ] ) are not .",
    "we note that our lb entropy maximization results are what @xcite would have obtained had he not used the stirling approximation .",
    "the procedure does not rely on any approximations , and is well motivated from first principles , assuming that all states are equally accessible and efficient mixing in phase - space can be achieved .",
    "this begs the question , do such systems exist ?",
    "more work with simulations is needed to address this question .",
    "our mb entropy maximization results of section  [ smax ] ( and the very similar results of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) describe some globular clusters well @xcite , and the results of @xcite describe n - body and esim halos .",
    "these facts lead us to the following chain of reason .",
    "first , globular clusters , along with n - body and esim halos , are self - gravitating systems .",
    "second , the entropy maximization procedures that produce successful models of these systems require correct treatment of low phase - space occupation numbers .",
    "therefore , it appears that the low occupation number regime is an important distinction between self - gravitating and non - self - gravitating systems .    why is this the case ?",
    "we speculate that self - gravitating systems are special not only because they are finite in extent due to the long - range nature of the force , but also because of correlations between spatial regions and energies of particles .",
    "specifically , the center of the potential contains phase - space elements with the most bound energies , while the outskirts are populated by elements with the least bound , or even zero energies .",
    "these requirements are peculiar to self - gravitating systems , and apparently necessitate low occupation numbers because the numbers of particles in these regions must approach zero .",
    "however , the above hypothesis does not explain why the discrete version of @xmath22 must be smoothed to represent real systems .",
    "this smoothing , though apparently necessary , is still not well justified .",
    "the steady - state of self - gravitating systems can apparently be calculated as the maximum entropy state .",
    "though these systems are in mechanical equilibrium , one could argue that they are not in conventional thermal equilibrium because their kinetic temperature is manifestly different across the system .",
    "can we reconcile maximum entropy defining thermodynamic equilibrium with the resulting non - constant temperature ?",
    "( note that a realistic self - gravitating system can not have a constant kinetic temperature , because there is no finite - mass solution to the jeans equation with constant @xmath24 . )",
    "this contradiction is part of the reason why it made sense to conclude , based on @xcite work that there is no maximum entropy state for self - gravitating systems .",
    "we propose that for gravitationally - bound collisionless systems , one must carefully separate kinetic temperature @xmath111 from thermodynamic temperature @xmath112 . to be clear , the kinetic temperature we are referring to is related to the rms value of the peculiar velocity in a system , @xmath113 . the thermodynamic temperature is linked to the energy scale @xmath51 that serves as a lagrange multiplier through @xmath114 . by definition , @xmath112 must be a constant , and there is no contradiction as in @xcite  systems in the maximum entropy state are characterized by a constant thermodynamic temperature , even as they have a varying kinetic temperature .",
    "we can also address a related question involving the temperature and energy change that appear in the thermodynamic definition of entropy , @xmath115 .",
    "this temperature must be a constant , so we would associate this with the thermodynamic temperature @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath116 ( normally called heat ) refers to all non - work exchanges of energy , and so must be replaced by @xmath117 because in collisionless self - gravitating systems what is being transferred is total energy , potential and kinetic , not just kinetic .",
    "entropy changes can occur due to changes in mass distribution as well as kinetic energy transport .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge support from nasa astrophysics theory program grant nnx07ag86 g .",
    "we also thank our anonymous referee for several helpful suggestions .",

    "note that if the standard stirling approximation had been employed , the second and third terms would be absent and the logarithmic term would simply read @xmath126 . in this case , the usual , physically inconsistent , mb distribution function would result .    as before ,",
    "we make a change of variables , @xmath72 , and the derivative of the @xmath56 function is given by equations  [ lamderiv ] .",
    "equation  [ smbmax ] can then be re - cast as , @xmath127 again , we have not searched for an analytical solution , but graphical solutions for @xmath65 for a range of @xmath52 values can be combined to produce a plot of @xmath128 .",
    "specifically , figure  [ f_mb ] illustrates the behavior of the normalized coarse - grained distribution function @xmath68 for a particular value of @xmath13 .",
    "values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath50 and @xmath51 were adjusted so that @xmath52 is always positive . because mb statistics have no exclusion principle , @xmath68 can have values above 1 .",

    "substituting @xmath75 from the boltzmann equation into equation  [ mbk1 ] results in a lengthy expression , similar to equation  [ lbk2 ] in the lynden - bell case .",

    "we next turn our attention to the terms involving acceleration in equation  [ mbk2 ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath139  is velocity - independent implies that @xmath140 , a fact that will be used often in dealing with these terms .",
    "let us start with the first part of the the second term on the right - hand side of equation  [ mbk2 ] , @xmath141 integrating by parts produces two terms , one with the form , @xmath142 \\ : { \\mathrm{d}}{\\ensuremath{\\boldsymbol{v}}}.\\ ] ] which equals zero after using the divergence theorem and the fact that any physical distribution function must vanish for large velocities .",
