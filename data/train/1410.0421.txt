    "for example , an integral solution for pulse propagation in silicon was obtained in the case of small variation of the temporal pulse  @xcite .",
    "such methods provide information on intrapulse temporal dynamics , but basic physical interactions are often embedded in implicit equations making it challenging to derive intuitive understanding . alternatively , to elucidate the physical scalings of pulse propagation dynamics explicitly",
    ", we can derive a set of evolution equations for discrete parameters such as energy and pulse duration .",
    "these latter methods allow trends to be isolated and quickly evaluated over a broad range of parameters .",
    "a well - known example is the calculation of the raman - induced soliton self - frequency shift in optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "recently , perturbation theory has been applied to soliton interaction with free - carriers effects  @xcite .",
    "this technique can directly estimate the soliton blueshift , but pulse parameters are limited to those of a fundamental soliton .",
    "a more general analytic treatment of pulse propagation in silicon photonics should allow unconstrained parameters .",
    "the method of moments provides general trends by allowing arbitrary pulse shapes and parameter sets .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) quantities of interest for the pulse are defined and differential evolution equations are extracted  @xcite . the method of moments has been applied to glass media such as optical fibers to estimate jitter in optical communications  @xcite , as well as model intrapulse raman scattering  @xcite and the nonlinear dynamics of short pulses  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the moment method has not been applied to semiconductor effects such as nonlinear losses and free - carrier interactions .    in this article , we apply the method of moments to pulse propagation in silicon photonics .",
    "we derive general equations for pulse evolution taking into account two - photon absorption ( tpa ) and free - carrier dispersion ( fcd ) and absorption ( fca ) in addition to dispersion and self - phase modulation ( spm ) .",
    "analytical expressions for the free - carrier induced blueshift and acceleration are obtained .",
    "these are found to depend explicitly on the pulse peak power only , due to the accumulated nature of free - carrier effects .",
    "surprisingly , they are found to be independent of the pulse temporal duration .",
    "the moment equations are then solved numerically to study the influence of free - carrier effects in silicon photonic crystal and nanowire waveguides . finally , the moment trends are compared with full numerical simulations and experiments , and good agreement is found over a broad range of input powers .",
    "the model developed here provides a concise and general picture of the complex pulse shaping effects observed in silicon waveguides directly in terms of the basic physical mechanisms underpinning them .",

    "the effective mode area is @xmath13 and the vacuum wavevector is @xmath14 .    for the free - carrier density in silicon , we consider that two - photon absorption is the dominant generation mechanism .",
    "this is the case when doping and carrier injection are absent .",
    "the free - carrier density is then governed by the equation : @xmath15 we have defined the free - carrier generation rate @xmath16 with @xmath17 the photon energy , and @xmath18 is the free - carrier lifetime . from here on we will assume that the free - carrier recombination term is negligible .",
    "this requires @xmath18 to be much longer than an individual pulse but much shorter that the pulse train period . for silicon waveguides we have @xmath19  ns  @xcite , so this assumption is valid for femtosecond and picosecond pulses with megahertz repetition rates .",
