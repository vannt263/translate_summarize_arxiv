    "since the first measurement of the muon neutrino charged current quasielastic double differential cross section @xcite many attempts have been made to characterize an effective axial - vector form factor of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "this is often made in terms of a dipole axial mass @xmath8 , assuming a dipole form @xcite , for @xmath9 @xmath10 the world average value of the nucleon dipole axial mass is @xmath11 gev @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite for a review and references therein ) which is obtained as a weighted sum of different oncoming dipole fits to independent experiments .",
    "however , this does not mean that the full spread of axial form factors can be described by a single dipole mass with a given uncertainty in a statistically significant way .",
    "actually , there is a great variety of often largely incompatible experimental data from different processes which for illustration can be seen at fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] . the correct discrimination and selection of these mutually compatible data is a complicated problem in data analysis which requires proper weighting of experimental ranges and falsifiable reliable theoretical input and not just parameterizations which awaits resolution and will not be addressed here .",
    "nonetheless , given the present rather confusing state of affairs and the lack of further qualified information on what data on the axial form factor should one objectively prefer we will face the problem from a different and somewhat unconventional perspective where the traditional fitting strategy is sidestepped by the use of a theoretically based axial form factor with an inherent error band .",
    "the miniboone cross section data values are too large compared to the theoretical models of quasielastic neutrino scattering in the impulse approximation , unless a significant larger value of @xmath12 gev is employed in the nuclear axial current .",
    "microscopic explanations of the large value of @xmath8 have been proposed based on ingredients involving nucleon spectral functions and multinucleon emission induced by short range correlations and meson exchange currents @xcite .",
    "recently studies with a monopole parameterization have been performed in @xcite as well as nucleon mean field effective mass analyses of blurred electron scattering data  @xcite . in the absence of reliable theoretical uncertainty estimates ,",
    "the disparate values obtained upon consideration of different nuclear effects can so far be regarded as a genuine source of systematic errors .",
    "those turn out to be much larger than the alleged statistical uncertainties which , if taken literally , would lead to the most precise determination of the axial form factor to date in the range @xmath13 . a careful statistical analysis has been undertaken more recently  @xcite and some tension among different data in different models has been reported .",
    "the popular dipole form factor parameterization enjoys the pqcd result  @xcite asymptotically , @xmath14 , but despite the phenomenological success for separate and independent experiments , it finds no further theoretical support at finite @xmath5 , nor does it describe _ all _ experiments globally with an acceptable @xmath15 value .",
    "moreover , a one parameter fit such as the dipole form introduces an artificial bias linking high and low energies unnaturally and tightly ; it is unclear if the statistical fluctuations inherited from the uncertainties in experimental neutrino - nucleus scattering data are faithfully represented by the corresponding fluctuations in the dipole mass .",
    "this is a well known issue in the statistical analysis of data since the goodness of fit and the parameter confidence level is based on estimating the probability that the proposed parameterization be the correct one , and this implies a mapping between data fluctuations and the fitting parameter fluctuations . to overcome this limitation a model independent analysis of axial form factor using dispersion relations under definite convergence assumptions and based on neutrino scattering",
    "was performed  @xcite , with the expected finding that errors inferred from a dipole ansatz analysis may be underestimated .",
    "a duality based parameterization has been proposed searching for significant deviations to the widely used dipole form  @xcite . to be fair",
    "one should say that the neutrino scattering vs nucleon axial form factor is a kind of red herring ; the significance of nuclear effects is claimed _ after _ a fit of the dipolar mass to the data is undertaken in which case astonishingly precise values for the dipolar mass are inferred ( see e.g. @xcite where extremely accurate values for @xmath8 are quoted ) . since neutrino based determinations often imply certain and some times questionable assumptions , it is instructive to review other sources of information which at least do not rest on the same assumptions .    on a fundamental level , _ ab initio _ calculations allow a direct evaluation of the axial current matrix elements .",
    "the first lattice qcd determination of the axial form factor @xcite provided @xmath16 in agreement with world average neutrino data at the time @xmath17 .",
    "however , subsequent calculations  @xcite yield @xmath18 , a number which has recently been confirmed  @xcite for unphysical pion masses ( about twice the physical value ) ; the corresponding dipolar axial mass is larger than the experimental one , although there is some trend to agreement as the pion mass approaches the physical value .",
    "the role of excited states has been analyzed in a more recent lattice analysis  @xcite confirming these results .",
    "in addition , light cone qcd sum rules also overestimate the experimental dipole fit by @xmath19@xcite in the range @xmath20 , a trend checked by subsequent analyses  @xcite and agreeing also with lattice calculations .",
    "while these qcd calculations are still subjected to many improvements , one should also recognize that they generate a family of axial nucleon form factors which fall within the experimental band which is wide enough to pose again the pertinent question on which are the correct ones within uncertainties .",
    "this situation makes an interesting case of lifting the conventional fitting strategy based on _ ad hoc _ parameterizations and incompatible data in favor of assuming a theoretically founded axial nucleon form factor with a credible uncertainty band generated by independent fluctuations and not directly based on the neutrino - nucleus data under discussion . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple scheme furnishing these requirements , see section  [ sec : ffa ] , and provide a framework where the significance of different nuclear effects might be addressed .    on the more phenomenological hadronic level ,",
    "the algebra of fields  @xcite which yields field - current identities  @xcite imply a generalized meson dominance which has proven as a convenient tool to analyze many important hadronic properties and most notably generalized vertex functions and hadronic form factors  @xcite . in the particular case of conserved currents , and more specifically axial - vector currents the general form of the form factor",
    "is expected to be a sum of infinitely many monopoles with isovector _ axial _ meson masses , whereas the pqcd result  @xcite yields @xmath14 .",
    "the goodness of the axial vector meson dominance ( avmd ) for the axial nucleon form factor was posed in ref.@xcite by including the strong vertex corrections",
    ". however , meson dominance implies exchange of resonances which have a mass spectrum characterized by a mass and a width . amazingly there is a theoretical limit where meson - dominance with narrow resonances is realized in qcd , namely the large @xmath1-limit introduced by thootf and witten long ago  @xcite ; within the large @xmath1 expansion mesons become stable particles .",
    "their width - to - mass ratio is @xmath21 which turns out to give the correct order of magnitude of the average experimental value 0.12(8 )  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological implications of meson dominance within a large @xmath1 approach have been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite and , after natural uncertainty estimates based on the resonance width , a good description of experimental data and lattice results was achieved , with competitive accuracy .    motivated by these theoretical insights , in the present paper",
    "we explore the large-@xmath1-inspired parameterization of the nucleon axial form factor @xcite , see section  [ sec : ffa ] , and explore the consequences of axial - vector dominance directly .",
    "we apply these findings to neutrino - nucleus scattering by starting with the simplest nuclear model , i.e. , the relativistic fermi gas , see section  [ sec : qens ] , which can be worked analytically . we do this without fitting any neutrino data in section  [ sec : num ] .",
    "this simple approach allows to address more clearly some important issues from a statistical point of view , and in particular to pin down the region of @xmath5-values where the axial nucleon form factor fits are more sensitive to the existing neutrino - nucleus scattering data , see section  [ sec : goodness ] .",
    "we finally summarize our results in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "axial - vector meson dominance ( avmd ) was first introduced by lee and zumino  @xcite into particle physics as a very natural generalization of the successful realization that vector - meson dominance explained the bulk of electromagnetic form factors .",
    "it simply states that the axial - vector current is given by the current field identity , which for just @xmath22 quarks reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the decay amplitudes of the axial - vector @xmath26 and pseudoscalar mesons @xmath27 respectively and @xmath28 is the corresponding field strength tensor of the axial meson .",
    "this equation yields a generalized pcac , which implies in turn a generalization  @xcite of the celebrated goldberger - treimann relation .    as a consequence",
    "the axial form factor of the nucleon can be written as a sum of monopole form factors , @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the vacuum amplitude , the coupling to the nucleon and the mass respectively of the corresponding isovector - axial - vector meson @xmath34 . from @xmath35",
    "we have the normalization condition @xmath36 the asymptotic pqcd result  @xcite , @xmath14 , requires @xmath37 in this paper we use the minimal hadronic ansatz for axial nucleon form factor furnishing meson dominance and proper pqcd behavior @xmath38 with @xmath39 , and where the axial meson masses are @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 gev . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite one of the problems with this ansatz is that generally the interpolating fields are resonances which have a mass and a width , and we stand by the solution proposed there to use the width as a genuine uncertainty of the meson dominance ansatz .",
    "this generates a full band of predictions which provide an uncertainty range for a formula of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffa ] ) .",
    "the experimental widths are @xmath42 gev , and @xmath43 gev as listed in the pdg compilation  @xcite  .",
    "one can add a further axial state fixing the radius to its precise value , and comply to the pqcd short distance constraint but the effect is not large .",
    "this way one might take into account , the tiny and predictable differences between axial radii determined by either electroproduction or neutrino scattering . ] .",
    "the masses are only the central values of the axial mesons spectra .",
    "we use the half - width rule to generate random values for @xmath44 and @xmath45 following gaussian distributions with variances @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "this provides a distribution band for the axial form factor  @xcite which is slightly above the bulk of the abundant and incompatible @xmath0 data , see fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] , but agrees well with the lattice  @xcite and light cone qcd sum rules estimates  @xcite",
    ".    it might be useful to provide a parameterization of the uncertainty bands of the avmd form factor as @xmath48 .",
    "the lower and upper axial form factors are defined as the boundaries of the usual @xmath49 68% confidence level region .",
    "they can be parameterized as a product of two monopoles , similarly to eq .",
    "( 6 ) , as @xmath50 with @xmath51 . by a fit in the range @xmath52 ,",
    "corresponding to the blue band of fig.1 , the cut - off parameters turn out to be @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , respectively ( in gev ) .",
    "these values illustrate the fact that the fluctuations of the form factor do not necessarily correspond to a single dipole mass fluctuation",
    ".    we will thus apply this axial form factor band for the neutrino cross section theoretical predictions .",
    "our point of view is that given the many effects which might contribute to neutrino - nucleus scattering it may be sensible to use a credible form factor with an error estimate based on a different source of data , without resting on a specific fit to the neutrino data . it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the large-@xmath1 meson dominated form factors with pqcd constraints and supplemented with the half - width rule for an uncertainty estimate worked well also for other form factors such as electromagnetic , scalar and gravitational form factors . as a general rule uncertainties turned out to be comparable or smaller than lattice qcd predictions but larger than experimental data",
    "after presenting our main results , for completeness we will also analyze the conventional approach of fitting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffa ] ) to the miniboone data .",
    "we want to investigate the traditional point of view of _ assuming _ certain nuclear effects before undertaking a fit of the axial form factor of the nucleon .",
    "for example in ref .",
    "@xcite a model with nucleon spectral functions , rpa correlations and mec has been considered and a fit to the axial form factor has been undertaken assuming a fixed @xmath55-transition form factor .",
    "we want to understand why in these studies one can extract more accurate information on the axial form factor than on the nuclear model response functions .    anticipating some of the results to be discussed below , and for a comparison we depict also in fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] the results found in the analysis of  @xcite where the role of nuclear effects beyond the local fermi - gas have been addressed when a dipole form factor is fitted to the neutrino scattering data . as can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] the statistical errors are comparable when including the additional nuclear effects and the large and quite visible systematic change between the two fits is comparable to the spread generated by our avmd form factor . following the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite we also plot in fig .",
    "[ fa2 ] the ratio between the avmd form factor and the dipole form factor , eq .",
    "( [ eq : dipole ] ) , with @xmath56 in terms of the dimensionless variable @xmath57 defined there .",
    "this quotient was fitted in  @xcite by including an interpolating polynomial without discarding any of the compiled data which , as we have mentioned , are incompatible as a whole   values which are usually obtained when fitting mutually incompatible data and by the stiffness against fitting parameter variations .",
    "unfortunately , no @xmath15 value has been quoted and it is difficult to asses the goodness of fit . ] .",
    "as we can see the avmd model produces a spread compatible with the spread of the region covered by the form factor data .    in both fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fa2 ] we also highlight in shaded gray the main @xmath5 region where fluctuations in the axial form factor have a sizable impact in the miniboone data , as will be discussed below in section  [ sec : goodness ] .",
    "thus , our avmd motivated axial form factor describes reasonably well the known data spread in the @xmath5-region relevant for the miniboone experiment .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the charged - current quasielastic ( ccqe ) reactions in nuclei induced by neutrinos .",
    "in particular we compute the @xmath58 cross section .",

    "the nuclear structure function @xmath70 is defined as a linear combination of the five nuclear response functions ( + is for neutrinos and @xmath71 is for antineutrinos ) @xmath72 where the @xmath73 coefficients depends only on the neutrino and muon kinematics and do not depend on the details of the nuclear target .",

    "the single nucleons are described by plane wave spinors and the response functions are analytical .",
    "it is a remarkable result that the nuclear response function @xmath79 of the rfg is proportional to a single - nucleon response function @xmath84 times the so - called scaling function @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the neutron number , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",

    "we show results for the flux - averaged doubly differential ccqe cross section as a function of the muon kinetic energy .",
    "the bands are the axial meson - dominance model predictions for fixed values of @xmath117 at the center of the experimental bins .",
    "the miniboone @xmath118 ccqe flux - integrated double differential cross section is provided in bins @xmath119 of @xmath120 and bins @xmath121 of @xmath117 .",
    "the size of the bins is @xmath122 , and @xmath123 gev .    for a meaningful comparison with the experimental data we have computed the averaged cross section for each bin , by integrating the doubly - differential cross section over each discrete bin .",
    "@xmath124    the axial vector dominance predictions for the averaged cross section @xmath125 are also shown in figure [ dcros ] , where they are compared to the experimental data .",
    "the theoretical errors are again computed by assuming a gaussian distribution of the axial meson masses .",
    "note that the averaged cross section for low scattering angles , bin @xmath126 - 1.0 , is quite different from the cross section at the central value @xmath127 .",
    "this is due to the strong angular dependence of the differential cross section for small angles , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ angulos ] .",
    "therefore the integration of the cross section over the bin is crucial to get the correct average .",
    "note also that in this region the momentum transfer takes the smallest values compatible with energy transfer , and one expects that the model dependence of the results be maximized . as a matter of fact according to ref .",
    "@xcite the shell structure effects for both discrete and continuum are essentially washed out in favor of the rfg . for larger scattering angles ,",

    "to get a global measure of the goodness of the theoretical model in describing the experimental data requires including both theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",

    ". globally the model agrees remarkably well with data taking into account that we do not minimize any @xmath15 and we just compute it .",
    "while the @xmath15 value seems to be acceptable , let us analyze the assumptions underlying the comparison and its statistical significance in some more detail .",
    "we are just testing that the difference between the theory and the data should behave as a random variable , namely a standardized normal distribution .",
    "however , a look to the fig .",
    "[ chi2 ] reveals that the level of disagreement is located at the edges of the plot , while we should expect a more uniform pattern globally if the @xmath129 were distributed randomly .",
    "this can be further elucidated by analyzing the differences .",
    "we find that there is a strong asymmetry in the residuals @xmath129 , indicating gross systematic differences .",
    "thus , we believe that these large discrepancies are possibly beyond the applicability of the rfg . at the same time one should also admit that the double binning procedures , essential for a proper comparison with the data , tend to wash out nuclear effects .    as we anticipated in our discussion around fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] some fits to the dipolar axial mass do generate rather good @xmath15 values and unprecedented accuracy for the axial form factor  @xcite .",
    "let us remind that , a too low value is as bad as a too high value , since the @xmath15-distribution for a large number of degrees of freedom @xmath137 behaves as a gaussian distribution and thus it must be @xmath138 within @xmath49 confidence level .",

    "we assume a theoretically based axial form factor with an a priori uncertainty estimate , regardless of the neutrino data we intend to describe .",

    "as it has been done in previous determinations of other hadronic and generalized form factors we have taken as an educated guess the half width rule for the axial - vector isovector masses .",
    "the produced spread is fairly consistent with the current experimental and lattice spread of values .",
    "most remarkably the errors in the axial form factor determined by the axial - vector dominance and using the half width rule , while quite generous , do not generally produce larger uncertainties in the neutrino - nucleus scattering than the experimental differential cross sections reported by the miniboone collaboration . we have also provided evidence that the region of the axial form factor having most impact in the miniboone data is in the range @xmath163 , whereas fluctuations outside this regime tend to be marginal .",
    "we stress that these features can not be captured by the conventional dipole parameterization .",
    "of course the minimal hadronic ansatz could be improved by adding other poles from the pdg axial mesons compilation . in the case of three poles , unlike the present case additional unknown information such as e.g. the coupling of the third meson to the nucleon is needed .",
    "one could expect that the future neutrino data might be accurate enough to pin down this extra parameter .",
    "our analysis has been carried out using the rfg model which for the quasielastic region does not seem to miss effects which are larger than the present uncertainty in the axial form factor using the avmd ansatz supplemented with the half - width rule .",

    "<S> the axial form factor plays a crucial role in quasielastic neutrino - nucleus scattering , but the error of the theoretical cross section due to uncertainties of @xmath0 remains to be established . </S>",
    "<S> reversely , the extraction of @xmath0 from the neutrino nucleus cross section suffers from large systematic errors due to nuclear model dependencies , while the use of single parameter dipole fits underestimates the errors and prevents an identification of the relevant kinematics for this determination . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use a generalized axial - vector - meson - dominance ( avmd ) in conjunction with large-@xmath1 and high energy qcd constrains to model the nucleon axial form factor , as well as the half width rule as an a priori uncertainty estimate . </S>",
    "<S> the minimal hadronic ansatz comprises the sum of two monopoles corresponding to the lightest axial - vector mesons being coupled to the axial current . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the resulting axial form factor are the masses and widths of the two axial mesons as obtained from the averaged pdg values . by applying the half width rule in a monte carlo simulation , a distribution of theoretical predictions </S>",
    "<S> can then be generated for the neutrino - nucleus quasielastic cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we test the model by applying it to the @xmath2 quasielastic cross section from @xmath3c for the kinematics of the miniboone experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting predictions have no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the relativistic fermi gas model globally reproduces the experimental data , giving @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath5-dependent error analysis of the neutrino data shows that the uncertainties in the axial form factor @xmath6 are comparable to the ones induced by the a priori half width rule . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the most sensitive region to be in the range @xmath7 . </S>"
