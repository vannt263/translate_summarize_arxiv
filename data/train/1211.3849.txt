    "it is of very high expectation that the observed particle at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite is the long - sought higgs boson of the standard model ( sm ) , which was proposed in 1960s @xcite . at the end of 2011 ,",
    "both the atlas and cms @xcite experiments at the lhc have seen some excess of events of a possible higgs boson candidate in the decay modes of @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 channels .",
    "finally , the discovery was announced in july 2012 by atlas @xcite and cms @xcite .",
    "the channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 are consistent with the predictions of the sm higgs boson , while the @xmath2 rate is somewhat higher than expectation .",
    "some evidence is seen in the @xmath6 mode at the tevatron @xcite , but the mass range is quite wide . on the other hand , the @xmath10 mode appears to shy away from the detectors , albeit the data contain large uncertainties .",
    "the diphoton production rate is about a factor of @xmath11 as much as that of the sm higgs boson .",
    "a large number of models have been put forward to account for the observed particle at 125 gev , including the sm , mssm , nmssm , @xmath12-extended minimal supersymmetric standard model , and other mssm - extended models , fermiophobic higgs , 2hdm of various types , randall - sundrum radion , inert - higgs doublet , triplet higgs models ( a summary of various models can be found in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "they all can explain the enhanced diphoton rate with some choices of parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , the most peculiar observation is that the @xmath10 mode is suppressed @xcite in the data .",
    "mode is measured to be @xmath13 ( cms ) and @xmath14 ( atlas ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15 mode is still suppressed but with a large uncertainty . ]",
    "if this picture persists in the upcoming data , it would be a sign for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) has enough free parameters that allow one to achieve a light cp - even higgs boson of 125 gev , for which the @xmath16 and @xmath17 modes are consistent with the sm higgs boson , the diphoton mode is enhanced , and @xmath10 mode is suppressed .",
    "this can be achieved in the type ii 2hdm in the following parameter space @xmath18 in this case , @xmath19 , which is close to 1 for large enough @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16 and @xmath17 modes are about the same as the sm , and the @xmath10 mode is highly suppressed . with a reduced total width",
    "the @xmath2 branching ratio is enhanced .",
    "in fact , this is the favorable region for enhancement in the diphoton mode obtained in ref .",
    "other related works in 2hdm can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite    in this letter , we show that with the choice of the parameter space of eq.([parameters ] ) the lighter cp - even higgs boson @xmath21 is consistent with the observed data , and the heavier cp - even higgs boson @xmath22 can be observable through the associated production with a @xmath6 pair in the @xmath23 final state at the 8 tev and 14 tev lhc .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "instead of one , the 2hdm employs two higgs doublets . in order to avoid dangerous tree - level flavor - changing neutral currents ,",
    "a discrete @xmath24 symmetry is usually imposed in all the popular 2hdms .",
    "a number of possible arrangements of the two doublets and various scenarios of the mass spectra for the higgs bosons are recently analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite in light of current data . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the type ii , which has the same higgs sector as the mssm .",
    "gev is not the best fit to the current higgs data , it still provides a decent good fit @xcite . ]",
    "the higgs sector consists of two higgs doublets @xmath25 and @xmath26 where the subscripts @xmath27 denote the right - handed quark singlet fields that the higgs doublets couple to .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , there are two cp - even , one cp - odd , and a pair of charged higgs bosons . the parameters of the model in the cp - conserving case can be chosen as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mixing angle between the two cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "all these are free parameters of the model but subjected to theoretical and experimental constraints . with a common factor of @xmath30 being suppressed , the couplings of the lighter and heavier cp - even higgs bosons @xmath21 and @xmath22 to the tau , bottom and top quarks are , respectively , given by @xmath31 other relevant couplings of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are those to the weak gauge bosons , which have a factor of @xmath32 and @xmath33 relative to the sm values , respectively .",
    "although @xmath4 is chosen in eq .",
    "( [ parameters ] ) , we do not consider the case when @xmath34 is fine - tuned to a value very close to zero , say smaller than @xmath35 .",
    "in such a case , the factor @xmath36 remains suppressed even if @xmath20 is extremely large . in the case when the smallest value of @xmath34 is around @xmath37 and @xmath20 is larger than 20 , the factor @xmath36 becomes substantial and so the lighter higgs boson @xmath38 is no longer suppressed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , if @xmath34 is fine - tuned to @xmath35 , then @xmath20 can be much larger than 20 , and even around 60 the decay @xmath38 is still strongly suppressed . on the other hand , if @xmath39 the factor @xmath40 is not suppressed enough such that the heavier higgs boson @xmath41 for @xmath42 gev might appear in the data . in this work , we use a small @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the first constraint we must consider is the radiative decay of @xmath45 meson , @xmath46 , as well as the @xmath45-@xmath47 mixing , both of which receive contributions from the charged higgs boson . as shown in @xcite , we are safe if we take @xmath48 gev for @xmath49 .",
    "yet , the most important experimental constraint on the 2hdm comes from the @xmath50 parameter , which is theoretically and experimentally in the vicinity of @xmath51 , so that there is almost no room for deviations and it implies a strong restriction on the splitting of the higgs boson masses . in 2hdm",

    "just the first term @xmath57 in eq.([rho ] ) can be of order @xmath58 for @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev .",
    "one simple solution is to choose @xmath61 and @xmath62 , then the 2hdm contributions to the @xmath52 become minuscule .    unless @xmath20 is of order @xmath63 @xcite , for higgs boson masses larger than 100 gev the contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic dipole moment is very small .",
    "we will ignore this constraint .",
    "the next constraint is the current lhc data on the observed higgs boson , defined by the signal strength parameter which is the production rate relative to the corresponding sm one : @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "here we take the observed boson to be the lighter cp - even higgs @xmath21 .",
    "the current values for @xmath66 and @xmath67 are consistent with the sm and @xmath68 is larger than 1 , but @xmath69 appears to be suppressed .",
    "here we do not mean to perform a full scan of the parameter space , but only to emphasis that the parameter space of eq.([parameters ] ) would give an enhanced diphoton rate @xmath68 for the lighter cp - even higgs boson while keeping the @xmath66 and @xmath67 intact with the sm values @xcite .",
    "the bonus is the suppressed @xmath69 , which appears to be consistent with both the cms and atlas experiments that have reached the tau - pair detection sensitivity limit .",
    "the scenario defined by the parameter space of eq.([parameters ] ) would give an interesting signature for the heavier cp - even higgs boson .",
    "since @xmath70 for a large enough @xmath20 and @xmath4 , the heavier cp - even higgs @xmath22 couples very mildly to @xmath0 and @xmath1 while the decays into @xmath10 and @xmath6 are enhanced by @xmath20 . therefore , the current constraint of @xmath71 does not apply to @xmath22 , so that its mass @xmath72 can be anywhere between @xmath73 gev and 1 tev .",

    "the production of @xmath22 goes through gluon fusion and the associated production with a @xmath6 pair .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath22 via gluon fusion would be substantially smaller than that of the sm higgs boson .",
    "this is because in the region of eq.([parameters ] ) the top yukawa is suppressed by @xmath82 whereas the bottom yukawa @xmath83 does not receive a large enough enhancement for @xmath44 to make up for the mass suppression factor from @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the gluon fusion cross section would be at least a factor of 4 smaller than that of the sm higgs boson .",
