    "magnetars @xmath1 neutron stars powered by their extremely strong magnetic fields @xcite @xmath1 are distinguished by the emission of energetic bursts observed in the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray band .",
    "currently there are 28 sources classified as magnetars ( see the magnetar catalog , @xcite for detailed information ) .",
    "magnetar bursts can be classified according to durations and energetics : short bursts last a fraction of a second and involve an isotropic energy of @xmath2 erg .",
    "intermediate events are slightly longer , typically a few seconds , and the emitted energy is about 2 orders of magnitude larger .",
    "magnetars emit giant flares but very rarely ; only three such flares have been observed to date .",
    "the giant flares are at the extreme of the burst energy scale ( @xmath310@xmath4 erg ) and relatively long , lasting a few hundreds of seconds , during which there are remarkable spectral and temporal variations . for a comprehensive list of studies on magnetar bursts ,",
    "see the magnetar burst library .    , also known as 1e 1547.0 - 5408 or psr j1550 - 5418 , is a magnetar with currently the shortest spin period , 2.072 s @xcite .",
    "the spin period and spin - down rate were measured first in the radio band @xcite .",
    "it was first proposed as a magnetar candidate by @xcite based on its magnetar - like x - ray spectrum and association with a supernova remnant .",
    "identification of its spin period and spin - down rate , which implies a magnetic field strength of 2.2@xmath510@xmath6 g , further supported the suggested magnetar hypothesis @xcite .",
    "although there were implications that it has gone through x - ray brightening episodes @xcite , magnetar - like bursts from the source were not observed until 2008 october @xcite . exhibited other intense bursting episodes in 2009 january and march @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous extensive investigations in order to understand the burst and persistent x - ray emission properties of .",
    "@xcite , using _",
    "swift _ observations of the 2008 october burst activation , found that the 2@xmath110 kev flux was elevated by @xmath050 times above its quiescent level , and that its pulsed fraction has also increased significantly .",
    "spectral analysis of the bursts observed with the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on board _ swift _ revealed that a blackbody model with temperature of 11 kev represents the burst spectra very well @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed the bursts observed with the _ fermi _ gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) in 2008 october and 2009 march  april .",
    "they reported that the spectral characteristics of the bursts observed in two active episodes separated by about 5 months are different : the 2008 october burst spectra are best described with a single - blackbody function , while bursts observed in 2009 march  april are better fit with an optically thin thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "they interpreted this variation as a reflection of the changes in magnetic field structure of the source due possibly to another extreme - intense bursting episode that occurred in between these two periods ( in january 2009 ) .",
    "@xcite analyzed _ fermi _ gbm observations of 286 bursts detected during a week following 2009 january 22 , the most burst - active episode of the source .",
    "they reported that burst spectra can be described equally well with a comptonized model or double - blackbody model .",
    "@xcite additionally used simultaneous _",
    "swift _ observations to analyze the bursts of the same period including the soft x - ray band and found that the double - blackbody model represents the spectra better than the comptonized model .",
    "besides typical short bursts , there have been reports on more energetic events from , mostly during its 2009 january active phase .",
    "@xcite reported that some energetic bursts ( with energies as high as 10@xmath7  erg ) detected with _",
    "integral _ are followed by long emission episodes which are modulated with the spin period of the neutron star .",
    "@xcite identified a 150 s long enhanced persistent emission phase during which pulsed signals were detected up to @xmath0110 kev .",
    "@xcite identified two events in the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) observations of the same active episode and called them ` mini outbursts ' due to their long emission ( @xmath0450 s and @xmath0130 s ) at a much lower intensity than the bursts , but clearly above the persistent emission level . here , we call the latter events bursts with extended tails .    sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806@xmath120 have shown energetic bursts with extended tails ; extended tails typically last a few hundreds of seconds but can be as high as thousands of seconds . in all of these cases ,",
    "the spectral properties of the tail emission are different than from those of the bursts , as well as those of the persistent emission ; the tail spectra are well fitted with a blackbody model with decreasing temperature throughout the course of the tail , which implies a cooling thermal component on the surface , possibly heated by the initiating burst @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the total energy contained in the extended tails accounts for a constant percentage of the initiating burst event ; it is @xmath02@xmath8 for sgr 1900 + 14 @xcite while for the two detected tails in sgr 1806@xmath120 the ratios are @xmath00.34@xmath8 and @xmath00.63@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "motivated by the detection of extended tails from other magnetars , and having already identified two bursts with tails from @xcite , we extensively searched for extended tails following bursts in all available _ rxte _ observations of . however , detection of these tails on short timescales is not optimal due to variations of the background emission and , sometimes , the existence of hundreds of bursts in the active episode .",
    "thus , in the work presented here , we applied a bayesian block algorithm @xcite , which can detect local variabilities more robustly to search for burst tails from . in the following , the _ rxte _ observation details are found in section [ sec : data ] , and in section [ sec : bayesian ]",
    "we explain our search methodology for the detection of tails , as well as our search results .",
    "we present the results of our detailed spectral and temporal investigations of the identified burst tails in sections [ sec : spectral ] and [ sec : temporal ] , respectively .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of our results and compare with the properties of extended burst tails observed from other magnetars in section [ sec : discuss ] .",

    "we identified four events with durations of 15 , 3534 , 624 , and 773 s , and we have studied spectral and temporal properties of these four events .",
    "we compare below general properties of these events with one another , as well as those of extended burst tails detected from other magnetars , namely , sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806@xmath120 .",
    "the tail of event a has a much shorter duration ( @xmath013 s ) .",
    "moreover , unlike events b , c and d , its x - ray spectrum has non - thermal character ; it is described the best with a power - law model of index 1.37 , resembling the sgr burst spectral shape in the _",
    "rxte_/pca passband .",
    "the other three burst tails have thermal spectra , described with a blackbody model , at temperatures around 2@xmath13 kev , and more importantly showing a clear trend of declining blackbody temperature over the course of the tail . according to the magnetar model ,",
    "the repeated bursts from sgr sources are likely due to fracturing of the solid neutron star crust by magnetic stress @xcite or magnetic reconnection @xcite . in either case ,",
    "energetic electron@xmath1positron pair plasma would be induced into the magnetosphere which would be observed as energetic bursts .",
    "note the important fact that event a was detected on 2009 january 22 , that is the day was most burst active , and many energetic and relatively long bursts were also detected ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , event a is probably an exceptionally long burst , and the identified tail is most likely the continued emission of this prolonged event .",
    "extended burst tails were also seen from other magnetars : two from sgr 1900 + 14 , soon after its giant flare in 1998 august and intermediate flare in 2001 april @xcite , and two from sgr 1806@xmath120 during the 2003@xmath12004 burst - active episode prior to its giant flare in 2004 december @xcite .",
    "energies of the bursts leading to extended tails in sgr 1900 + 14 were at the highest of the scale for typical magnetar bursts . on the other hand , preceding bursts of sgr",
    "1806@xmath120 tails were not the highest - energy ones : there were a lot of other energetic bursts that were not followed by tails .",
    "similarly , we found that the energy of the tail triggering burst in could be as low as 3.01@xmath16  erg , and there were a lot of more energetic bursts @xcite .",
    "the extended tail phenomenon is , therefore , a special case in magnetar bursts ; there should be a minimum energy injection to ignite a tail , but not all bursts that are more energetic than the threshold would lead to extended tails . besides , unlike the other magnetars , in the case of the ratios of total energy contained in the tails and in the bursts seem to vary from event to event .",
    "hence , the question of what ignites extended tails can not be answered simply with the energetics of the main burst , as already pointed out by @xcite .",
    "an important common spectral property of all extended tails observed now from three sources is that they all exhibit thermal spectra and the temperatures decline , that is , cooling throughout the tail .",
    "the spectral cooling behavior in is not as significant as in the cases of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806@xmath120 tails , but still evident .",
    "the corresponding blackbody emitting area of tails remains fairly constant around 0.2@xmath10.3 km for events b , c , and d. similar to the earlier tails detected , extended tails are also exhibiting the cooling of a heated portion of the neutron star crust . given the energetics argument above and the spectral nature of tails , we suggest that the source of heating is the bombardment of the neutron star surface with returning pairs in the trapped fireball @xcite , which could not efficiently radiate away .",
    "therefore , the consequential cause of the generation of extended tails would depend on how efficiently the trapped plasma in the magnetosphere radiates away .",
    "as far as the temporal investigations of the extended tails are concerned , we do not find any phase dependence of leading bursts , and also any evidence of qpos in the high - frequency domain , which are observed from the giant flares of sgr 1900 + 14 and sgr 1806@xmath120 , and are attributed to torsional oscillations of the neutron star crust @xcite .",
    "apart from other causes , the qpo phenomenon likely requires a much higher burst energetic threshold than that of extended tails to excite torsional modes .",
    "interestingly , we find a significant pulsed amplitude increase in the very early portion of event d , which has one of the least burst energetics .",
    "this burst energy argument conditionally strengthens our hypothesis of surface heating with returning pairs because as more energy is imparted back to the system , the energy content of radiated portion would naturally be less .",
