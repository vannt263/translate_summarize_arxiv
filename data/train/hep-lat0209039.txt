    "we begin with a @xmath0 u(1 ) gauge theory described by the euclidean action @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 we are interested in the relationship between monopoles and classical chaos across the phase transition at @xmath4 . following ref .",
    "@xcite , we have factorized our gauge configurations into monopole and photon fields .",
    "the u(1 ) plaquette angles @xmath5 are decomposed into the `` physical '' electromagnetic flux through the plaquette @xmath6 and a number @xmath7 of dirac strings through the plaquette @xmath8 where @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 is called a dirac plaquette .",
    "chaotic dynamics in general is characterized by the spectrum of lyapunov exponents .",
    "these exponents , if they are positive , reflect an exponential divergence of initially adjacent configurations . in case of symmetries inherent in the hamiltonian of the system",
    "there are corresponding zero values of these exponents . finally negative exponents belong to irrelevant directions in the phase space : perturbation components in these directions die out exponentially .",
    "pure gauge fields on the lattice show a characteristic lyapunov spectrum consisting of one third of each kind of exponents  @xcite . assuming this general structure of the lyapunov spectrum we investigate presently its magnitude only , namely the maximal value of the lyapunov exponent , @xmath11 .",
    "the general definition of the lyapunov exponent is based on a distance measure @xmath12 in phase space , @xmath13 in case of conservative dynamics the sum of all lyapunov exponents is zero according to liouville s theorem , @xmath14 .",
    "we utilize the gauge invariant distance measure consisting of the local differences of energy densities between two @xmath15 field configurations on the lattice : @xmath16 here the symbol @xmath17 stands for the sum over all @xmath18 plaquettes , so this distance is bound in the interval @xmath19 for the group su(n ) . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the familiar plaquette variables , constructed from the basic link variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 located on lattice links pointing from the position @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the generators of the group are @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the pauli matrices in case of su(2 ) and @xmath28 is the vector potential . the elementary plaquette variable is constructed for a plaquette with a corner at @xmath29 and lying in the @xmath30-plane as @xmath31 .",
    "it is related to the magnetic field strength @xmath32 : @xmath33 the electric field strength @xmath34 is related to the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath35 via @xmath36    the hamiltonian of the lattice gauge field system can be casted into the form @xmath37.\\ ] ] here the scalar product stands for @xmath38 .",
    "the staple variable @xmath39 is a sum of triple products of elementary link variables closing a plaquette with the chosen link @xmath40 .",
    "this way the hamiltonian is formally written as a sum over link contributions and @xmath39 plays the role of the classical force acting on the link variable @xmath40 .",
    "we prepare the initial field configurations from a standard four dimensional euclidean monte carlo program on a @xmath41 lattice varying the inverse gauge coupling @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "we relate such four dimensional euclidean lattice field configurations to minkowskian momenta and fields for the three dimensional hamiltonian simulation by identifying a fixed time slice of the four dimensional lattice .",
    "we start the presentation of our results with a characteristic example of the time evolution of the distance between initially adjacent configurations .",
    "an initial state prepared by a standard four dimensional monte carlo simulation is evolved according to the classical hamiltonian dynamics in real time . afterwards",
    "this initial state is rotated locally by group elements which are chosen randomly near to the unity .",
    "the time evolution of this slightly rotated configuration is then pursued and finally the distance between these two evolutions is calculated at the corresponding times .",
    "a typical exponential rise of this distance followed by a saturation can be inspected in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] from an example of u(1 ) gauge theory in the confinement phase and in the coulomb phase .",
    "while the saturation is an artifact of the compact distance measure of the lattice , the exponential rise ( the linear rise of the logarithm ) can be used for the determination of the leading lyapunov exponent .",
    "the left plot exhibits that in the confinement phase the original field and its monopole part have similar lyapunov exponents whereas the photon part has a smaller @xmath43 .",
    "the right plot in the coulomb phase suggests that all slopes and consequently the lyapunov exponents of all fields decrease substantially .",
    "the main result of the present study is the dependence of the leading lyapunov exponent @xmath11 on the inverse coupling strength @xmath42 , displayed in fig .",
    "as expected the strong coupling phase is more chaotic .",
    "the transition reflects the critical coupling to the coulomb phase .",
    "the plot shows that the monopole fields carry lyapunov exponents of nearly the same size as the full u(1 ) fields .",
    "the photon fields yield a non - vanishing value in the confinement ascending toward @xmath44 for randomized fields which indicates that the decomposition works well only around the phase transition .",
    "an interesting result concerning the continuum limit can be viewed from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows the energy dependence of the lyapunov exponents for the u(1 ) theory and its components .",
    "one observes an approximately linear relation for the monopole part while a quadratic relation is suggested for the photon part in the weak coupling regime . from scaling arguments",
    "one expects a functional relationship between the lyapunov exponent and the energy @xcite @xmath45 with the exponent @xmath46 being crucial for the continuum limit of the classical field theory .",
    "a value of @xmath47 leads to a divergent lyapunov exponent , while @xmath48 yields a vanishing @xmath49 in the continuum .",
    "the case @xmath50 is special leading to a finite non - zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "our analysis of the scaling relation ( [ scaling ] ) gives evidence , that the classical compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory and especially the photon field have @xmath51 and with @xmath52 a regular continuum theory .",
    "the monopole field signals @xmath53 and stays chaotic approaching the continuum .",
