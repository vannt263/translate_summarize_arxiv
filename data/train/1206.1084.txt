    "most of our collective activities are regulated by other people who decide whether they are well done or not .",

    "human rules over collective activities govern the evolution of our culture . on the contrary , natural systems , from atoms to galaxies , evolve independently of the human rules .",
    "men can not modify physical laws .",
    "we can only try to understand them .",
    "nature itself judges , through experiments , whether a plausible explanation for some natural phenomena is correct or not . nevertheless , in forefront research where the unknowns start to become understandable , the new knowledge is still unstable , somehow immature .",
    "it is supported by unclear experimental evidences or the evidences are still subjected to different interpretations .",
    "certainly , novel research grows up closely tied to the economical , sociological or historical circumstances of the involved researchers .",
    "a period of time is needed in order to distil new knowledge , separating pure scientific arguments from cultural influences .",
    "the past and the present status of bohmian mechanics can not be understood without these cultural considerations .",
    "the bohmian formalism was proposed by louis de broglie even before the standard , i.e. , copenhagen , explanation of quantum phenomena was established .",
    "bohmian mechanics provides an explanation of quantum phenomena in terms of point particles guided by waves .",
    "one object can not be a wave and a particle simultaneously , but two can .",
    "specially , if one of the objects is a wave and the other is a particle .",
    "unfortunately , louis de broglie , himself , abandoned these ideas .",
    "later , in the fifties , david bohm clarified the meaning and applications of this explanation of quantum phenomena .",
    "bohmian mechanics agrees with all quantum experiments done up to now .",
    "however , it remains almost ignored by most of the scientific community . in our opinion , there are no scientific arguments to support its marginal status , but only cultural reasons .",
    "one of the motivations for writing this book is helping in the maturing process that the scientific community needs about bohmian mechanics .",
    "certainly , the distilling process of bohmian mechanics is being quite slow .",
    "anyone interested enough to walk this causal road of quantum mechanics can be easily confused by many misleading signposts that have been raised in the scientific literature , not only by its detractors , but unfortunately very often also by some of its advocates .",
    "nowadays , following opinions from other reputed physicists ( we are easily persuaded by those scientists with authority ) is far from being a proper scientific strategy to get our own opinion about bohmian mechanics .    in any case , since the mathematical structure of bohmian mechanics is quite simple , it can be easily learned by anyone with only a basic knowledge of classical and quantum mechanics who makes the necessary effort to build his own scientific opinion based on logical deductions , free from cultural influences .",
    "the introductory chapter of this book , including a thorough list of exercises and easily programmable algorithms , provides a reasonable and objective source of information in order to achieve this later goal , even for undergraduate students .",
    "curiously , the fact that bohmian mechanics is ignored and remains mainly unexplored is an attractive feature for some adventurous scientists .",
    "they know that very often _ new cutting edge ideas come from outside of the main stream _ and find in bohmian mechanics a useful tool in their research activity . on the one hand , it provides an explanation of quantum mechanics , in terms of trajectories , that results to be very useful in explaining the dynamics of quantum systems , being thus also a source of inspiration to look for novel quantum phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "since it provides an alternative mathematical formulation , bohmian mechanics offers new computational tools to explore physical scenarios that presently are computationally inaccessible , such as many - particle solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "in addition , bohmian mechanics sheds light on the limits and extensions of our present understanding of quantum mechanics towards other paradigms such as relativity or cosmology , where the internal structure of bohmian mechanics in terms of well - defined trajectories is very attractive . with all these previous motivations in mind ,",
    "this book provides eight chapters with practical examples showing how bohmian mechanics helps us in our daily research activity .",
    "obviously , there are other books focused on bohmian mechanics .",
    "however , many of them are devoted to the foundations of quantum mechanics emphasizing the difficulties or limitations of the copenhagen interpretation for providing an ontological description of our world . on the contrary ,",
    "this book is not at all devoted to the foundations of quantum mechanics , but only to discuss about the practical application of the ideas of de broglie and bohm to understand the quantum world .",
    "several examples of such practical applications written by leading experts in different fields , with an extensive updated bibliography , are provided here .",
    "the book , in general , is addressed to students in physics , chemistry , electrical engineering , applied mathematics , nanotechnology , as well as to both theoretical and experimental researchers who seek new computational and interpretative tools for their everyday research activity .",
    "we hope that the newcomers to this causal explanation of quantum mechanics will use bohmian mechanics in their research activity so that bohmian mechanics will become more and more popular for the broad scientific community .",
    "if so , we expect that , in the near future , bohmian mechanics will be taught regularly at the universities , not as the unique and revolutionary way of understanding quantum phenomena , but as an additional and useful interpretation of all quantum phenomena in terms of quantum trajectories .",
    "in fact , bohmian mechanics has the ability of removing most of the mysteries of the copenhagen interpretation and , somehow , simplifying quantum mechanics",
    ". we will be very glad if this book can contribute to shorten the time needed to achieve all these goals .",
    "finally , we want to acknowledge many different people that has allowed us to embark into and successfully finish this book project .",
    "first of all , alfonso alarcn and albert benseny who became involved in the book project from the very beginning , as two additional editors .",
    "we also want to thank the rest of the authors of the book for accepting our invitation to participate in this project and writing their chapters according to the general spirit of the book . due to page limitations ,",
    "only eight examples of practical applications of bohmian mechanics in forefront research activity are presented in this book .",
    "therefore , we want to apologize to many other researchers who could have certainly been also included in the book",
    ". we also want to express our gratitude to _ pan stanford publishing _ for accepting our book project and for their kind attention during the publishing process .",
    "the beginning of the twentieth century brought surprising non - classical phenomena .",
    "max planck s explanation of the black body radiation @xcite , the work of albert einstein on the photoelectric effect @xcite and the niels bohr s model to account for the electron orbits around the nuclei @xcite established what is now known as the _ old quantum theory_. to describe and explain these effects , phenomenological models and theories were first developed , without any rigorous and global justification . in order to provide a complete explanation for the underlying physics of such new nonclassical phenomena , physicists were forced to abandon classical mechanics to develop novel , abstract and imaginative formalisms .    in 1924 ,",
    "louis de broglie suggested in his doctoral thesis that matter , apart from its intrinsic particle - like behavior , could exhibit also a wave - like one @xcite .",
    "three years later he proposed an interpretation of quantum phenomena based on non - classical trajectories guided by a _ wave field _  @xcite .",
    "this was the origin of the pilot - wave formulation of quantum mechanics that we will refer as bohmian mechanics to account for the following work of david bohm @xcite . in the bohmian formulation ,",
    "an individual quantum system is formed by a point particle and a guiding wave .",
    "contemporanely , max born and werner heisenberg , in the course of their collaboration in copenhagen with niels bohr , provided an original formulation of quantum mechanics without the need of trajectories @xcite .",
    "this was the origin of the so - called copenhagen interpretation of quantum phenomena and , since it is the most accepted formulation , it is the only one explained at most universities .",
    "thus , it is also known as the _ orthodox _ formulation of quantum mechanics . in the copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "an individual quantum system is simultaneously both a wave and a particle and exhibits its wave or its particle nature depending on the experimental arrangement .",
    "the present status of bohmian mechanics among the scientific community is quite marginal ( the quantum chemistry community is an encouraging exception ) .",
    "most researchers do not know about it or believe that is not fully - correct .",
    "there are others that know that quantum phenomena can be interpreted in terms of trajectories , but they think that this formalism can not be useful in their daily research activity . finally , there are few researchers , the authors of this book among them , who think that bohmian mechanics is a useful tool to make progress in front - line research fields involving quantum phenomena .",
    "the main ( non - scientific ) reason why still many researchers believe that there is something wrong with bohmian mechanics can be illustrated with hans christian andersen s tale _ the emperor s new clothes_. two swindlers promise the emperor the finest clothes that , as they tell him , are invisible to anyone who is unfit for their position",
    ". the emperor can not see the ( non - existing ) clothes , but pretends that he can for fear of appearing stupid .",
    "the rest of the people do the same .",
    "advocates of the copenhagen interpretation have attempted to produce _",
    "impossibility proofs _ in order to demonstrate that bohmian mechanics is incompatible with quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "most researchers , who are not aware of the incorrectness of such _ proofs _ , might conclude that there is some controversy with the bohmian formulation of quantum mechanics and they prefer not to support it , for fear of appearing discordant . at the end of the tale ,",
    "during the course of a procession , a small child cries out `` _ _ the emperor is naked ! _ _ '' . in the tale of quantum mechanics ,",
    "david bohm @xcite and john bell @xcite were the first to exclaim to the scientific community `` _ _ bohmian mechanics is a correct interpretation of quantum phenomena that exactly reproduce the predictions of the orthodox interpretation !",
    "_ _ '' .",
    "researchers who have spent the necessary time to analyze the ideas of de broglie and bohm with the pertinent scientific rigor accept that there is no scientific argument against them .",
    "bohmian mechanics agrees with all quantum experiments done up to now .",
    "however , most of such researchers do also believe that bohmian mechanics is not a useful tool to do research . in the words of steven weinberg , in a private exchange of letters with sheldon goldstein @xcite : _ `` in any case , the basic reason for not paying attention to the bohm approach is not some sort of ideological rigidity , but much simpler  it is just that we are all too busy with our own work to spend time on something that does nt seem likely to help us make progress with our real problems.''_. + the history of science seems to give credit to weinbergs sentence . in spite of the controversies that have always been associated with the copenhagen interpretation since its birth a century ago",
    ", its mathematical and computational machinery has enabled physicists , chemists and ( quantum ) engineers to calculate and predict the outcome of a vast number of experiments , while the contribution of bohmian mechanics during the same period is much less significative . in our opinion ,",
    "the differences are due to the fact that bohmian mechanics remains mainly unexplored .",
    "contrarily to weinberg s opinion , we believe that bohmian mechanics _ can help us make progress with our real problems_. there are , at least , three clear reasons why one could be interested in studying quantum problems with bohmian mechanics :    1 .",
    "* bohmian _ explaining _ : * even when the copenhagen mathematical machinery is used to compute observable results , the bohmian formulation ofently offers better interpretational tools .",
    "we can find descriptions of electron dynamics such as _ `` an electron crosses a resonant tunneling barrier and interacts with another electron inside the well''_. however , an electron crossing a tunneling region is not rigourously supported within orthodox quantum mechanics , but it is within the bohmian picture .",
    "thus , in contrast to the copenhagen formulation , the bohmian formulation allows for an easy visualization of quantum phenomena in terms of trajectories that has important demystifying or clarifying consequences .",
    "in particular , it provides a single - event description of the experiment , while copenhagen quantum mechanics accounts for its statistical or ensemble explanation .",
    "we will present several examples in chapters 2 and 3 emphasizing all these points .",
    "* bohmian _ computing _ : * although the predictions of the bohmian formulation reproduce the ones of the orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics , its mathematical formalism is different . in some systems , bohmian equations might provide better computational tools than the ones obtained from the orthodox machinery , resulting in a reduction of the computational time , an increase in the number of degrees of freedom directly simulated , etc .",
    "we will see examples of these computational issues in quantum chemistry in chapters 4 and 5 , as well as in quantum electron transport in chap . 6 .",
    "* bohmian _ thinking _ : * from a more fundamental point of view , alternative formulations of quantum mechanics can provide alternative routes to look for the limits and possible extensions of the quantum theory . as we will discuss later",
    ", the work of john bell on non - locality is a clear example of the unquestionable utility of understanding quantum phenomena with bohmian mechanics .",
    "in particular , chap .",
    "7 presents the route to connect bohmian mechanics with geometrical optics and beyond .",
    "the natural extension of bohmian mechanics to the relativistic regime and to quantum field theory are presented in chap .",
    "8 , while chap .",
    "9 discusses its application to cosmology .",
    "the fact that all measurable results of the orthodox quantum mechanics can be exactly reproduced with bohmian mechanics is the relevant point that completely justifies why bohmian mechanics can be used for * _ explaining _ * or * _ computing _ * different quantum phenomena in physics , chemistry , electrical engineering , applied mathematics , nanotechnology , etc . in the scientific literature ,",
    "the * bohmian _ computing _ * technique to find the trajectories ( without directly computing the wavefunction ) is also known as a _ syntectic _",
    "technique , while the * bohmian _ explaining _ * technique ( where the wavefunction is directly computed first ) is referred to the _ analytic _ technique @xcite .",
    "furthermore , among others , the fact that bohmian mechanics provides a picture in terms of single events which is missing in the orthodox explanation , is an attractive feature for those researchers interested in * _ thinking _ * about the limits or extensions of the quantum theory .    in order to convince the reader about the practical utility of bohmian mechanics for * _ explaining _ * , * _ computing _ * or * _ thinking _ * , we will not present elaborated mathematical developments or philosophical discussions , but provide practical examples .",
    "apart from the first chapter , devoted to an overview of bohmian mechanics , the book is divided into eight additional chapters with several examples on the practical application of bohmian mechanics to different research fields , ranging from atomic systems to cosmology .",
    "these examples will clearly show that the previous quotation by weinberg does not have to be always true .",
    "any possible newcomer to bohmian mechanics can certainly be quite confused and disoriented by the large list of names and slightly different explanations of the original ideas of de broglie and bohm that are present in the scientific literature .",
    "different researchers use different names .",
    "certainly , this is an indication that the theory is still not correctly settled down among the scientific community .    in his original works @xcite ,",
    "de broglie used the term _ pilot - wave theory _",
    "@xcite , to emphasize the fact that wave - fields guided the motion of point particles .",
    "after de broglie abandoned his theory , bohm rediscovered it in the seminal papers entitled _ `` a suggested interpretation of the quantum theory in terms of hidden variables '' _ @xcite .",
    "the term _ _ hidden variables _ _ , refering to the positions of the particles , was perhaps pertinent in 1952 , in the context of the _ impossibility proofs _ @xcite .",
    "nowadays , these words might seem inappropriate because they suggest something metaphysical on the trajectories .    to give credit to both de broglie and bohm",
    ", some researchers refer to their works as the _ _ de broglie ",
    "bohm theory__@xcite .",
    "some reputed researchers argue that de broglie and bohm did not provide the same exact presentation of the theory @xcite .",
    "while de broglie presented a first order development of the quantum trajectories ( integrated from the velocity ) , bohm himself did a second order ( integrated from the acceleration ) emphasizing the role of the quantum potential .",
    "the differences between both approaches appear when one considers initial ensembles of trajectories which are not in quantum equilibrium . ] . except for this issue , which will not be addressed in this book , both approaches are identical .",
    "many researchers prefer to use the name _ bohmian mechanics _",
    "it is perhaps the most popular name .",
    "we know directly from his alive collaborators , basile hiley and david peat @xcite , that this name irritated david bohm and he said about its own work `` _ _ it s bohmian non - mechanics _ _ '' .",
    "he argued that the _",
    "quantum potential _ is a non - local potential that depends on the relative shape of the wavefunction and thus it is completely different from other mechanical ( such as the gravitational or the electrostatic ) potentials . see this particular discussion in the last chapters of bohm and hiley s book entitled _ the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory _",
    "he preferred the names _ causal _ or _ ontological interpretation _ of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the latter names emphasize the foundational aspects of its formulation of quantum mechanics .",
    "finally , another very common term is _ quantum hydrodynamics _",
    "@xcite that underlines the fact that bohmian trajectories provide a mathematical relationship between the schrdinger equation and fluid dynamics .",
    "in fact , this name is more appropriate when one refers to the madelung s theory @xcite , which is considered as a precursor of de broglie s and bohm s work , see sec .",
    "[ om.sec_intro.9 ] .    from all these different names , we chose * bohmian mechanics * because it is short and clearly specifies what we are referring to .",
    "it has the inconvenience of not giving credit to the initial work of louis de broglie .",
    "although it might be argued that bohm merely reinterpreted the prior work of de broglie , we think that he was the first person to genuinely understand its significance and implications .",
    "as we mentioned , bohm himself disliked this name .",
    "however , as any work of art , the merits and influence of bohm s 1952 paper evolve independently of the own author opinion .. the paper becomes part of the scientific heritage . in any case , we understand bohmian mechanics as a generic name that includes all those works inspired from the original ideas of bohm and de broglie . in the fig .",
    "[ om_datos_bohm ] , we plot the numbers of citations per year for the 1952 bohm s seminal papers  @xcite , certifying the exponentially growing influence of these papers , which is not the case for the original work of de broglie  @xcite .",
    "[ om_datos_bohm ]      the book contains nine chapters .",
    "it can be clearly divided in two different parts . the first part is formed by chapter 1 alone that provides an accessible introduction to bohmian mechanics .",
    "the second part is composed of the rest of chapters with practical examples on the applicability of bohmian mechanics .",
    "* chapter 1 * is the longest one and it is entitled * overview of bohmian mechanics*. it is written by xavier oriols and jordi mompart , the editors of the book , both from the universitat autnoma de barcelona , spain .",
    "this chapter is intended to be an introduction to any newcomer interested in bohmian mechanics .",
    "no previous knowledge on bohmian mechanics is required . only basic concepts of classical and quantum mechanics",
    "is assumed .",
    "the chapter is divided into four different sections .",
    "first , the historical development of bohmian mechanics is presented .",
    "then , bohmian mechanics for single particle and for many particle systems ( with spin and entanglement explanations ) are discussed in sections two and three , respectively .",
    "the topic of bohmian measurement is addressed in section four .",
    "the chapter contains also a list of exercises , mathematical demonstrations an easily implementable algorithms for computation of bohmian trajectories .",
    "* chapter 2 * is entitled * hydrogen photoionization with strong lasers*. it is written by albert benseny and jordi mompart from the universitat autnoma de barcelona , spain ; antonio picn from anl , the argonne national laboratory , illinois , usa ; luis plaja from the universidad de salamanca , spain ; and luis roso from the clpu , the laser center for ultrashort and ultraintense pulses , also in salamanca .",
    "they discuss the dynamics of a single hydrogen atom interacting with a strong laser .",
    "in particular , the bohmian trajectories of these electrons represent an interesting illustrating view of both the above threshold ionization and the harmonic generation spectra problems .",
    "they do also present a full three dimensional model to discuss the dynamics of bohmian trajectories when the light beam and the hydrogen atom exchange both spin and orbital angular momentum . the chapter does also provide a practical example on how bohmian mechanics are computed , with an analytical ( i.e.",
    ", * bohmian _ explaining _ * ) procedure , when full ( scalar and vector potentials ) electromagnetic fields are considered .",
    "the title of * chapter 3 * is * atomtronics : coherent control of atomic flow via adiabatic passage*. it is written by albert benseny , joan bagud , xavier oriols , and jordi mompart from the universitat autnoma de barcelona , spain ; and gerhard birkl from the institut fr angewandte physik , from the technische universitt darmstadt , germany . here , it is discussed an efficient and robust technique to coherently transport a single neutral atom , a single hole , or even a bose - einstein condensate between the two extreme traps of the triple - well potential .",
    "the dynamical evolution of this system with the direct integration of the schrdinger equation presents a very counterintuitive effect : by slowing down the total time duration of the transport process it is possible to achieve atomic transport between the two extrem traps with a very small ( almost negligible ) probability to populate the middle trap .",
    "the analytical ( i.e. , * bohmian _ explaining _ * ) solution of this problem with bohmian trajectories enlightens the role of the _ particle conservation law _ in quantum systems showing that the negligible particle presence is due to a sudden particle acceleration yielding , in fact , ultra - high atomic velocities . the bohmian contribution opens the discussion about the possible detection of such high kinetic energies or the need for a relativistic formulation to accurately describe such a simple quantum system .    *",
    "chapter 4 * , entitled * the role of trajectories in quantum chemistry and chemical physics * , is written by ngel s. sanz and salvador miret - arts from the instituto de fsica fundamental , consejo superior de investigaciones cientficas , spain . up to very recently , the * bohmian _ computing _ * abilities have been explored almost exclusively by the quantum chemistry community . in the own words of the authors : _ `` it is interesting to note that bohmian mechanics is better accepted within the chemistry community than within the physics one , which is often quite reluctant  to some extent , it could be said that the pedagogical advantages that bell associated with bohmian mechanics have been better appreciated by chemists than by physicists.''_. there are many different bohmian computational techniques developed by the quantum chemistry community , mainly , during the last ten years . since it was impossible to dedicate a chapter to each , here ,",
    "the authors provide a clear summary of the problems and bohmian solutions .    *",
    "chapter 5 * , whose title is * adaptive quantum monte carlo approach states for high - dimensional systems * , is written by eric r. bittner , donald j. kouri , sean derrickson , from university of houston ; and jeremy b. maddox , from the western kentucky university , in usa .",
    "they provide one particular example on the success of bohmian mechanics in the chemistry community . in this chapter ,",
    "the authors explain their * bohmian _ computing _ * development to calculate the _ ab initio _ quantum mechanical structure , energetics and thermodynamics of multi - atoms systems .",
    "they use a variational approach that finds the quantum ground sate ( or even excited states at finite temperature ) using a statistical modeling approach for determining the best estimate of a quantum potential for a multi - dimensional system .",
    "* chapter 6 * is entitled * nanoelectronics : quantum electron transport*. it is written by alfonso alarcn , guillem albareda , fabio lorenzo traversa and xavier oriols from the universitat autnoma de barcelona , spain .",
    "the authors explain the ability of their own many - particle * bohmian _ computing _ * algorithm to understand and model the behavior of nanoscale electron devices .",
    "in particular , it is shown that the adaptation of bohmian mechanics to electron transport in open systems ( with interchange of particles and energies ) leads to a quantum monte carlo algorithm , where randomness appears because of the uncertainties in the number of electrons , their energies and the initial positions of ( bohmian ) trajectories .",
    "a general , versatile and time - dependent 3d electron transport simulator for nanoelectronic devices , named bitlles ( bohmian interacting transport for nonequilibrium electronic structures ) , is presented showing its ability for a full prediction ( dc , ac , fluctuations ) of the electrical characteristics of any nanoelectronic device .",
    "* chapter 7 * , entitled * beyond the eikonal approximation in classical optics and quantum physics * , is written by adriano orefice , raffaele giovanelli and domenico ditto from the universit degli studi di milano , italy .",
    "it is devoted to discuss how * bohmian _ thinking _ * can also help in optics , exploring the fact that the time - independent schrdinger equation is strictly analogous to the helmholtz equation appearing in classical wave theory .",
    "starting from this equation they obtain indeed , without any omission or approximation , a hamiltonian set of ray - tracing equations providing ( in stationary media ) the exact description in term of rays of a family of wave phenomena ( such as diffraction and interference ) much wider than that allowed by standard geometrical optics , which is contained as a simple limiting case .",
    "they show in particular that classical ray trajectories are ruled by a wave potential presenting the same mathematical structure and physical role of bohm s quantum potential , and that the same equations of motion obtained for classical rays hold , in suitable dimensionless form , for quantum particle dynamics , leading to analogous trajectories and reducing to classical dynamics in the absence of such a potential .",
    "* chapter 8 * , entitled * relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum field theory * , is written by hrvoje nikoli from the rudjer bokovi institute , croatia .",
    "this chapter presents a clear example on how a * bohmian _ thinking _ * on superluminal velocities and nonlocal interactions helps in extending the quantum theory towards relativity and quantum field theory .",
    "a relativistic - covariant formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics of fixed number of particles ( with or without spin ) is presented , based on many - time wavefunctions and on an interpretation of probabilities in the spacetime .",
    "these results are used to formulate the bohmian formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics in a manifestly relativistic covariant form and are also generalized to quantum field theory .",
    "the corresponding bohmian formulation of quantum field theory describes an infinite number of particle trajectories . even though the particle trajectories are continuous , the appearance of creation and destruction of a finite number of particles results from quantum theory of measurements describing entanglement with particle detectors .    finally , *",
    "chapter 9 * , whose title is * sub - quantum accelerating universe * , is written by pedro f. gonzlez - daz and alberto rozas - fernndez from the instituto de fsica fundamental , consejo superior de investigaciones cientficas , spain .",
    "contrarily to the general belief , quantum mechanics does not only govern microscopic systems , but it has influence also on the cosmological domain . however , the extension of the copenhagen version of quantum mechanics to cosmology is not free from conceptual difficulties : the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction of the whole universe is somehow misleading because we can not make statistical ` measurements ' of different realizations of our universe .",
    "this chapter deals with two new cosmological models describing the accelerating universe in the spatially flat case . also contained in this chapter is a discussion on the quantum cosmic models that result from the existence of a nonzero entropy of entanglement .",
    "in such a realm , they obtain new cosmic solutions for any arbitrary number of spatial dimensions , studying the stability of these solutions , as well as the emergence of gravitational waves in the realm of the most general models .",
    "+ only eight chapters of practical applications of bohmian mechanics in forefront research activity , ranging from atomic systems to cosmology , are presented in this book .",
    "many more chapters could have certainly been also included . in any case",
    ", we believe that these examples are enough to convince the reader about the practical utility of * _ explaining _ * , * _ computing _ * and * _ thinking _ * about quantum phenomena within bohmian mechanics .",
    "in general , the history of quantum mechanics is explained in textbooks as a chronicle where each step follows naturally from the one preceding it . however , it was exactly the opposite .",
    "the development of quantum mechanics was a zigzagging route full of personal disputes .",
    "it was a painful history , where scientists were forced to abandon well - established classical concepts and to explore new and imaginative routes .",
    "most of the new routes went nowhere .",
    "others were simply abandoned . some of the explored routes were successful in providing new mathematical formalisms capable of predicting experiments at the atomic scale .",
    "even such successful routes were painful enough , so relevant scientists , such as albert einstein or erwin schrdinger , decided not to support them . in this section",
    "we will briefly explain the history of one of these routes : bohmian mechanics .",
    "it was first proposed by louis de broglie @xcite , who abandoned it soon afterward , and rediscovered by david bohm @xcite many years later , and it has been almost ignored by the scientific community since then . here",
    ", we will discuss the historical development of bohmian mechanics to understand its present status .",
    "also , we will introduce the basic mathematical aspects of the theory , while the formal and rigorous structure will be presented in the subsequent sections .",
    "the history of physics is a difficult topic because it does not only deals with its proper history but also deals with physics . in particular",
    ", quantum theory revolves around the notions of particles and waves . in classical physics ,",
    "the concept of a _ particle _ is very useful for the description of many natural phenomena .",
    "a particle is directly related to a _ _ trajectory _ _ @xmath0 $ ] that defines its position as a continuous function of time , usually found as a solution of a set of differential equations .",
    "for example , the planets can be considered particles orbiting around the sun , whose orbits are determined by the classical newton gravitational laws .    in classical mechanics , it is natural to think that the total number of particles ( e.g. , planets in the solar system ) is conserved , and the particle trajectories must be continuous in time : if a particle goes from one place to another , then , it has to go through all the trajectory positions between these two places .",
    "this condition can be summarized with a _ local _ conservation law : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density of particles and @xmath3 is the particle current density . for an ensemble of point particles at positions",
    "@xmath4 $ ] with velocites @xmath5 $ ] , it follows that @xmath6)$ ] and @xmath7 \\delta(\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}_{i}[t])$ ] , with @xmath8 being the dirac delta function .",
    "however , the total number of planets in the solar system could be conserved in another ( quite different ) way .",
    "a phenomenon where a planet disappearing ( instantaneously ) from its orbit and appearing ( instantaneously ) at another point far away from its original location would certainly conserve the number of planets but would violate eq .",
    "( [ om.difcurrent_density ] ) .",
    "we must then think of eq .",
    "( [ om.difcurrent_density ] ) as a _ local _ particle number conservation law .",
    "fields , and particularly waves , also appear in many explanations of physical phenomena .",
    "the concept of a field was initially introduced to deal with the interaction of distant particles .",
    "for example , there is an interaction between the electrons in an emitting radio antenna at the top of a mountain and those in the receiving antenna at home .",
    "such interaction can be explained through the use of an electromagnetic field .",
    "electrons in the transmitter generate an electromagnetic field , a radio wave , that propagates through the atmosphere and _ arrives _ at our antenna , affecting its electrons .",
    "finally , a loudspeaker transforms the electron motion into music at home .",
    "the simplest example of a wave is the so - called plane wave : @xmath9 where the angular frequency @xmath10 and the wave vector @xmath11 refer respectively to its temporal and spatial behavior . in particular ,",
    "the angular frequency @xmath10 specifies when the temporal behavior of such wave is repeated .",
    "the value of @xmath12 at position @xmath13 and time @xmath14 is identical to @xmath15 when @xmath16 for @xmath17 integer .",

    "waves can be a scalar or a vectorial function and take real or complex values .",

    "the shape of waves is determined by a set of differential equations . in our _ broadcasting _",
    "example , maxwell equations define the electromagnetic field of the emitted radio wave that is given by two vectorial functions , one for the electric field and one for the magnetic field .",
    "whenever the differential equations that govern the fields are linear , one can apply the superposition principle to explain what happens when two or more fields ( waves ) traverse simultaneously the same region .",
    "the modulus of the total field at each position is related to the amplitudes of the individual waves . in some cases",
    ", the modulus of the sum of the amplitudes is much smaller than the sum of the modulus of the amplitudes ; this is called destructive interference . in other cases ,",
    "it is roughly equal to the sum of the modulus of the amplitudes ; this is called constructive interference .      at the end of the nineteenth century",
    ", sir joseph john thomson discovered the electron , and in 1911 , ernest rutherford , a new zealander student working in thomson s laboratory , provided experimental evidence that inside atoms , electrons orbited around a nucleus in a similar manner as planets do around the sun .",
    "rutherford s model of the atom was clearly in contradiction with well - established theories , since classical electromagnetism predicted that orbiting electrons should radiate , gradually lose energy , and spiral inward .",
    "something was missing in the theory , since it seemed that the electron behavior inside an atom could not be explained in terms of trajectories .",
    "therefore , alternative ideas needed to be explored to understand atom stability .    in addition , at that time , classical electromagnetism was unable to explain the radiated spectrum of a black body , which is an idealized object that emits a temperature - dependent spectrum of light ( like a big fire with different _ colors _ , depending on the flame temperature ) .",
    "the predicted continuous intensity spectrum of this radiation became unlimitedly large in the limit of large frequencies , resulting in an unrealistic emission of infinite power , which was called the ultraviolet catastrophe .",
    "however , the measured radiation of a black body did not behave in this way , indicating that a wave description of the electromagnetic field was also incomplete .    in summary , at the beginning of the twentieth century , it was clear that natural phenomena such as atom stability or black - body radiation , were not well explained in terms of a particle or a wave description alone .",
    "it seemed necessary to merge both concepts .    in 1900 , max planck suggested @xcite that black bodies emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation in discrete energies @xmath24 , where @xmath18 is the frequency of the emitted radiation and @xmath25 is the ( now - called ) planck constant .",
    "five years later , einstein used this discovery in his explanation of the photoelectric effect @xcite , suggesting that light itself was composed of _ light quanta _ or _ _ photons _ _ of energy @xmath24 . even though this theory solved the black - body radiation problem , the fact that the absorption and emission of light by atoms are discontinuous was still in conflict with the classical description of the light - matter interaction .    in 1913",
    ", niels bohr @xcite wrote a revolutionary paper on the hydrogen atom , where he solved the ( erroneously predicted in classical terms ) instability by postulating that electrons can only orbit around atoms in some particular _ nonradiating _ orbits .",
    "thus , atom radiation occurs when electrons _",
    "jump _ from one orbit to another of lower energy .",
    "his _ imaginative _ postulates were in full agreement with the experiments on spectral lines .",
    "later , in 1924 , de broglie proposed , in his phd dissertation , that all particles ( such as electrons ) exhibit wave - like phenomena like interference or diffraction @xcite . in particular , one way to arrive at bohr s hypothesis is to think that the electron orbiting around the proton is a stationary wave that imposes simple restrictions on the shape of such a stationary wave .",
    "physics at the atomic scale started to be understandable by mixing the concepts of particles and waves .",
    "all these advances were later known as the _ old quantum theory_. the word _ quantum",
    "_ referred to the minimum unit of any physical entity ( e.g. , the energy ) involved in an interaction .      in the mid-1920s ,",
    "theoreticians found themselves in a difficult situation when attempting to advance bohr s ideas .",
    "a group of atomic theoreticians centered on bohr , max born , wolfgang pauli , and werner heisenberg suspected that the problem went back to trying to understand electron trajectories within atoms . in under two years , a series of unexpected discoveries brought about a scientific revolution @xcite .",
    "heisenberg wrote his first paper on quantum mechanics in 1925 @xcite and two years later stated his uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "it was him , with the help of born and pascual jordan , who developed the first version of quantum mechanics based on a matrix formulation @xcite .    in 1926 , schrdinger published _ an undulatory theory of the mechanics of atoms and molecules _ @xcite , where , inspired by de broglie s work @xcite , he described material points ( such as electrons or protons ) in terms of a wave solution of the following ( wave ) equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the potential energy _ felt _ by the electron , and the wave ( field ) @xmath28 was called the wave function .",
    "schrdinger , at first , interpreted his wave function as a description of the electron charge density @xmath29 with @xmath30 the electron charge . later , born refined the interpretation of schrdinger and defined @xmath31 as the probability density of _ finding _ the electron in a particular position @xmath32 at time @xmath33 @xcite .    schrdinger s wave version of quantum mechanics and heisenberg s matrix mechanics were apparently incompatible , but they were eventually shown to be equivalent by wolfgang ernst pauli and carl eckart , independently @xcite .    in order to explain the physics behind quantum systems , the concepts of waves and particles should be merged in some way .",
    "two different routes appeared :    1 .   *",
    "wave or particle ? * the concept of a trajectory was , consciously or unconsciously , abandoned by most of the young scientists ( heisenberg , pauli , dirac , jordan@xmath34 they started a new route , the _ wave or particle ?",
    "_ route , where depending on the experimental situation , one has to choose between a wave or a particle behavior .",
    "electrons are associated basically to probability ( amplitude ) waves .",
    "the particle nature of the electron appears when we measure the position of the electron . in bohr",
    "s words , an object can not be both a wave and a particle at the same time ; it must be either one or the other , depending upon the situation .",
    "this approach , mainly supported by bohr , is one of the pillars of the copenhagen , or orthodox , interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "wave and particle * : de broglie , on the other hand , presented an explanation of quantum phenomena where the wave and particle concepts merge at the atomic scale , by assuming that a pilot - wave solution of eq .",
    "( [ om.scho ] ) guides the electron trajectory .",
    "this is what we call the bohmian route .",
    "one object can not be a wave and a particle at the same time , but two can .",
    "the differences between the two routes can be easily seen in the interpretation of the double - slit experiment .",
    "a beam of electrons with low intensity ( so that electrons are injected one by one ) impinges upon an opaque surface with two slits removed on it . a detector screen , on the other side of the surface , detects the position of electrons .",
    "even though the detector screen responds to particles , the pattern of detected particles shows the interference fringes characteristic of waves .",
    "the system exhibits , thus , the behavior of both waves ( interference patterns ) and particles ( dots on the screen ) .    according to the _ wave or particle ?",
    "_ route , first the electron presents a wavelike nature alone when the wave function ( whose modulus gives the probability density of _ finding _ a particle when a position measurement is done ) _ travels _ through both slits .",
    "suddenly , the wave function _ collapses _ into a delta function at a ( random ) particular position on the screen .",
    "the particle - like nature of the electron appears , while its wavelike nature disappears . since the screen positions where _ collapses _ occur follow the probability distribution dictated by the modulus of the wave function , a wave interference pattern appears on the detector screen .",
    "according to the _ wave and particle _ route , the wave function ( whose modulus means the particle probability density of _ being _ at a certain position , regardless of the measurement process ) travels through both slits . at the same time , a well - defined trajectory is associated with the electron .",
    "such a trajectory passes through only one of the slits .",
    "the final position of the particle on the detector screen and the slit through which the particle passes is determined by the initial position of the particle .",
    "such an initial position is not controllable by the experimentalist , so there is an appearance of randomness in the pattern of detection .",
    "the wave function guides the particles in such a way that they avoid those regions in which the interference is destructive and are attracted to the regions in which the interference is constructive , giving rise to the interference pattern on the detector screen .",

    "de broglie showed in detail how the motion of a particle , passing through just one of two holes in screen , could be influenced by waves propagating through both holes . and so influenced that the particle does not go where the waves cancel out , but is attracted to where they cooperate .",

    "strangest _ route .",
    "in fact , bell argued that their choice was unprofessional @xcite .",
    "imagine that a student asks his or her professor , `` what is an electron ? ''",
    "the answer of a ( copenhagen ) professor could be , `` the electron is not a wave nor a particle .",
    "but , do not worry !",
    "you do not have to know what an electron is to ( compute observable results ) pass the exam . ''",
    "if the student insists , the professor might reply , `` shut up and calculate . ''",
    "another example of the vagueness of the orthodox formulation can be illustrated by the question that einstein posed to abraham pais : `` do you really think the moon is not there if you are not looking at it ? '' the answer of a copenhagen professor , such as bohr , would be , `` i do not need to answer such a question , because you can not ask me such question experimentally . ''    on the other hand , an alternative ( bohmian ) professor would answer , `` electrons are particles whose trajectories are guided by a pilot field which is the wave function solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "there is some uncertainty in the initial conditions of the trajectories , so that experiments have also some uncertainties . '' with such a simple explanation ,",
    "the student would understand perfectly the role of the wave and the particle in the description of quantum phenomena .",
    "furthermore , in the bohmian interpretation , the position of an electron ( or the moon ) while we are not looking at it , is always defined , even though it is a hidden variable for experimentalists .",
    "one of the reasons that led the proponents of quantum mechanics to choose the _ wave or particle ? _",
    "route is that the predictions about the positions of electrons are uncertain because the wave function is _ spread out _ over a volume .",
    "this effect is known as the _ uncertainty principle _ : it is not possible to measure , simultaneously , the exact position and velocity ( momentum ) of a particle .",
    "therefore , scientists preferred to look for an explanation of quantum effects without the concept of a trajectory that seemed unmeasurable . however , the argumentation about the impossibility of dealing with trajectories is , somehow , unfair and unjustified , since it relies on the `` principle '' that physical theories should not contain entities that can not be observed .",
    "in addition , everyone with experience on fourier transforms of conjugate variables recognizes the quantum uncertainty principle as a trivial effect present in any wave theory where the momentum of a particle depends on the slope of its associated wave function .",
    "then , a very localized particle would have a very sharp wave function . in this case",
    "such a wave function would have a great slope that implies a large range of possible momenta . on the contrary , if the wave function is built from a quite small range of momenta , then it will have a large spatial dispersion .",
    "perhaps the most relevant event for the development of the quantum theory was the fifth solvay conference , which took place from october 2429 , 1927 , in brussels @xcite .",
    "as on previous occasions , the participants stayed at _ htel britannique _",
    ", invited by ernest solvay , a belgian chemist and industrialist with philanthropic purposes due to the exploitation of his numerous patents . there , de broglie presented his recently developed pilot wave theory and how it could account for quantum interference phenomena with electrons @xcite .",
    "he did not receive an enthusiastic reaction from the illustrious audience gathered for the occasion . in the following months",
    ", it seems that he had some difficulties in interpreting quantum measurement with his theory and decided to avoid it .",
    "in fact , one ( nonscientific ) reason that forced de broglie to give up on his theory was that he worked isolated , having little contact with the main research centers in berlin , copenhagen , cambridge , or munich .",
    "by contrast , most of the copenhagen contributors worked with fluid and constant collaborations among them .",
    "finally , let us mention that the elements of the pilot wave theory ( electrons guided by waves ) were already in place in de broglie s thesis in 1924 @xcite , before either matrix or wave mechanics existed .",
    "in fact , schrdinger used the de broglie phases to develop his famous equation ( see eq .",
    "( [ om.scho ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , it is important to remark that de broglie himself developed a single - particle and a many - particle description of his pilot waves , visualizing also the _ nonlocality _ of the latter @xcite .",
    "perhaps , his remarkable contribution and influence have not been fairly recognized by scientists and historians because he abandoned his own ideas rapidly without properly defending them @xcite .",
    "not even einstein gave explicit support to the pilot wave theory @xcite .",
    "it remains almost unknown that in 1927 , the same year that de broglie published his pilot wave theory @xcite , einstein worked out an alternative version of the pilot wave with trajectories determined by many - particle wave functions .",
    "however , before the paper appeared in print , einstein phoned the editor to withdraw it .",
    "the paper remains unpublished , but its contents are known from a manuscript @xcite .",
    "it seems that einstein , who was unsatisfied with the copenhagen approach , did not like the pilot wave approach either because both interpretations have this notion of action at a distance : particles that are far away from each other can profoundly and _ instantaneously _ affect each other . as the father of the theory of relativity",
    ", he believed that action at a distance can not travel faster than the speed of light .",

    "perhaps the first utility of bohm s work was the demonstration that von neumann theorem had limited validity . in 1932 , von neumann put quantum theory on a firm theoretical basis @xcite .",
    "some of the earlier works lacked mathematical rigor , and he put the entire theory into the setting of operator algebra . in particular , von neumann studied the following question : `` if the present mathematical formulation of the quantum theory and its usual probability interpretation are assumed to lead to absolutely correct results for every experiment that can ever be done , can quantum - mechanical probabilities be understood in terms of any conceivable distribution over hidden parameters ? ''",
    "von neumann answered this question negatively .",
    "his conclusions , however , relied on the fact that he implicitly restricted his proof to an excessively narrow class of hidden variables , excluding bohm s hidden variables model .",
    "in other words , bohmian mechanics is a counterexample that disproves von neumann s conclusions , in the sense that it is possible to obtain the predictions of orthodox quantum mechanics with a hidden variables theory @xcite .",
    "bohm s formulation of quantum mechanics appeared after the orthodox formalism was fully established .",
    "bohm was , perhaps , the first person to genuinely understand the significance and fundamental implications of the description of quantum phenomena with trajectories guided by waves .",
    "ironically , in 1951 , bohm wrote a book , _ quantum theory _",
    "@xcite , where he provided `` proof that quantum theory is inconsistent with hidden variables '' ( see page 622 in [ 21 ] ) .",
    "in fact , he wrote in a footnote in that section , `` we do not wish to imply here that anyone has ever produced a concrete and successful example of such a [ hidden variables ] theory , but only state that such theory is , as far as we know , conceivable . '' furthermore , the book does also contain an unusually long chapter devoted to the _ quantum theory of the process of measurement _ , where bohm discusses how the measurement itself can be described from the time evolution of a wave function , rather than invoking the _ wave function collapse_. it seems that bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox approach that he had written in his book and began to develop his own causal formulation of quantum theory , which he published in 1952 @xcite .",
    "the original papers by bohm @xcite provide a formal justification of the guidance equation developed 25 years before by de broglie . instead of reproducing his exact mathematical development in terms of the quantum hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , here , we discuss a very simple explanation of the guidance equation . by a simple mathematical manipulation of the ( wave ) equation , eq .",
    "( [ om.scho ] ) , we can find the local ( particle ) continuity equation , eq .",
    "( [ om.difcurrent_density ] ) , discussed at the beginning of this section . or in ref .",
    "] from the standard definition of the current density @xmath3 , as a product of the particle density @xmath35    there was another important point explained by bohm in 1952 .",
    "if one considers an ensemble of trajectories whose initial positions at time @xmath36 are distributed according to @xmath37 , such an ensemble of trajectories will reproduce @xmath38 at any other time if the trajectories follow the guidance equation , eq .",
    "( [ om.guidance ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are able to exactly reproduce the time evolution of the wave function solution of eq .",

    "some authors argue that if we could change history , allowing bohm to help de broglie defend his pilot wave theory in the solvay conference , bohmian mechanics would now be certainly taught at universities @xcite .",
    "the enlightening work of bohm , however , appeared 25 years too late , once the copenhagen interpretation of quantum phenomena was already too well established .",
    "after the solvay conference , bohr , heisenberg , and their colleagues spread the new interpretation around the world and convinced the vast majority of the physics community that both quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation worked with extraordinary precision .",

    ", his didactic ability to defend bohmian mechanics against many unjustified attacks has been of extraordinary importance for maintaining the work of de broglie and bohm alive among the scientific community .",
    "fortunately , bell himself had his own reward from this unbreakable support of bohmian mechanics .",
    "his outstanding work on locality and causality was directly inspired by his deep knowledge of bohmian mechanics .",
    "bell s theorem has been called `` the most profound discovery of science '' @xcite .",
    "bell s most relevant contribution to physics is probably the demonstration that quantum mechanics is nonlocal , contrarily to what einstein expected . in 1964 ,",
    "inspired by the epr paper @xcite and bohm s work on _ nonlocal _ hidden variables , bell elaborated a theorem establishing clear mathematical inequalities , now known as bell inequalities , for experimental results that would be fulfilled by _",
    "local _ theories but would be violated by _ nonlocal _",
    "ones @xcite .",
    "over the past 30 years , a great number of bell test experiments have been conducted .",
    "these experiments have confirmed that bell s inequalities are violated ( see , for example , ref .",
    "therefore , we have to conclude that quantum experimental results can not be explained with local hidden variable theories . according to bell",
    ", we must accept the real existence , in nature , of faster - than - light causation .",
    "the experimental violation of bell s inequalities gave direct support , not only to the copenhagen interpretation , but also to bohm s formulation of quantum theory , since both are nonlocal theories .",
    "in the bohmian case , as we have discussed , the quantum potential of @xmath46 _ entangled _ particles is defined in a @xmath47 configuration space so that an action on the first particle can have an _ instantaneous _",
    "( i.e. , faster - than - light ) causal effect on the last particle . in bohmian mechanics",

    "this interaction is not classical , and we can not find a term in the potential energies of the many - particle hamiltonian of the schrdinger equation that accounts for it . alternatively , this new interaction is introduced in the `` shape '' of the global wave function , through the requirement of a particular symmetry of the global wave function .",

    "in general , note that the wave function is not separable , and it makes no sense to talk about the symmetry of the orbital and spin parts alone but only of the symmetry of the total wave function .",
    "we see that the exchange interaction induces correlations between particles by imposing symmetries ( or shapes ) to their many - particle wave function .",
    "a standard claim in many quantum mechanics textbooks is that identical particles , for example , two electrons with an antisymmetric wave function , are indistinguishable .",

    "he preferred the word `` experiment '' because `` when it is said that something is measured it is difficult not to think of the result as referring to some pre - existing property of the object in question . '' on the contrary , in an experiment , it is natural to think that everything can change , that is , time - evolve , because of interactions .",
    "according to bohmian postulates , the evolution of the wave function is uniquely determined by the schrdinger equation with the appropriate hamiltonian .",
    "surprisingly , this is not true for the orthodox formulation of quantum theory .",
    "let us discuss this point in detail in the next two subsections .      in the measurement process ,",
    "one usually separates the quantum system and the measuring apparatus ( see fig .",
    "[ om_measure2]b ) .",
    "the orthodox prediction of some experimental property of the quantum system is described through the use of a proper operator @xmath451 whose _ eigenvalues _ give the possible outcomes of the measurement .",
    "when we measure a particular eigenvalue , the initial wave function is transformed into an _ eigenfunction _ of the operator .",
    "this is the so - called von neumman ( or projective ) measurement .",
    "thus , the time evolution of the wave function of a quantum system is governed by two ( quite ) different laws :    1 .",
    "the first dynamical evolution is given by the schrdinger equation .",
    "this dynamical law is deterministic in the sense that the final wave function of the quantum system is perfectly determined when we know the initial wave function and the hamiltonian of the quantum system .",
    "the second dynamical law is called the _ collapse _ of the wave function .",
    "the collapse is a process that occurs when the wave function interacts with a measuring apparatus .",
    "the initial wave function before the measurement is substituted by one of the _ eigenstates _ of the particular operator @xmath451 .",
    "contrarily to the dynamical law given by the schrdinger equation , the collapse is not deterministic , since the final wave function is randomly selected among the operator s eigenstates .",
    "the duality in the time evolution of a quantum system in the orthodox interpretation is certainly a persistent controversial issue , the so - called _ measurement problem _ or _ collapse of the wave function _ @xcite .",

    "@xcite ) to be accepted as a proper measuring apparatus .",

    "this implies that the states @xmath471 and @xmath475 do not overlap in the larger configuration space during the measurement .",
    "since the eigenstates @xmath459 form a complete basis , we can decomposed any function , and in particular each @xmath476 , into the following sum : @xmath477 with @xmath478 .",
    "however , from our previous discussion about the properties of a `` good '' von neumann measurement apparatus , @xmath476 can not be a sum over different eigenstates @xmath459 in eq .",
    "( [ om.bmeasure2bis ] ) because then the measuring apparatus would provide the same pointer position @xmath469\\in s_{g}$ ] for different eigenstates .",

    "we have shown that the bohmian measurement has to provide the same eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "the answer is that according to the bohmian measurement , we have to specify in detail how the measurement process develops . in principle , for a formal bohmian discussion of measurement , we would have to discuss the wave function and particles of the whole quantum plus measuring apparatus system .",
    "however , in this and the next didactic examples , we will avoid the wave function and trajectory related to the measuring apparatus .",
    "-1a measurement of the momentum , for example , can be undertaken by removing the walls that form the well and detecting the electron somewhere in a screen far from the initial walls .",
    "the time interval between removing the walls and detecting the particles will allow us a computation of the `` electron velocity . ''",
    "the time - dependent process of removing the walls will imply that the stationary wave function will evolve into two time - dependent wave packets moving on opposite directions , which will become completely separated in space .",

    "for this particular experiment , we are sure that the empty wave will not affect the wave that carries the particle . as mentioned earlier , the relevant point is that we have been able to measure the same eigenstates and eigenvalues predicted by the orthodox interpretation without _ collapsing _ the wave function .    in order to understand the bohmian explanation of this experiment , it is important to discuss the roles played by the kinetic and quantum potentials .",

    "however , to be fair , the bohmian measurement process explained in the previous subsections has quite limited practical utility . including the measuring apparatus into the entire hamiltonian is not an easy task , because it implies increasing the number of degrees of freedom that one has to simulate from @xmath504 to @xmath505 .",
