    "it is well known that supercurrent can flow through a non - superconducting barrier between two superconducting reservoirs . initially this effect was predicted @xcite and microscopically analyzed @xcite for a specific case of ( usually very thin ) tunnel insulating barriers .",
    "later it was understood that non - dissipative transport of cooper pairs between two superconductors is also possible in many other types of weak links , such as , e.g. , quantum point contacts @xcite and superconductor - normal - metal - superconductor ( @xmath1 ) junctions @xcite , i.e. if a piece of a normal metal is placed in - between two superconductors .",
    "in contrast to tunnel junctions , in @xmath1 systems at sufficiently low temperatures appreciable supercurrent can flow even though a normal layer can be as thick as few microns .",

    "suffering andreev reflections at both @xmath2 interfaces , quasiparticles with energies below the superconducting gap are effectively `` trapped '' inside the junction forming a discrete set of levels which can be tuned by passing the supercurrent across the system . at the same time , these subgap andreev levels themselves contribute to the supercurrent thus making the behavior of superconducting point contacts and @xmath1 junctions in many respects different from that of tunnel barriers . for an extended review summarizing various features of dc josephson effect in different types of superconducting weak links we refer the reader to refs . .",

    "while at non - zero temperatures thermal fluctuations of the supercurrent should naturally exist in all types of weak links , in the limit @xmath3 the relevant physics is essentially determined by the presence or absence of subgap andreev states .",
    "provided such states are present fluctuations of the supercurrent do in general occur even at @xmath4 and at subgap frequencies .",
    "e.g. , the equilibrium supercurrent correlation functions show pronounced peaks at frequencies equal to the distance between andreev levels inside the weak link .",

    "thus , the result ( [ intcor ] ) can be interpreted in a very simple manner : coulomb interaction provides high frequency renormalization @xmath221 ( [ tcor ] ) of the barrier transmissions which should be substituted into the classical expression for the supercurrent ( [ ichi ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the last step would by no means appear obvious without our rigorous derivation since the coulomb correction to the josephson current originates from the term @xmath222 in the effective action which is , of course , totally absent in the normal case .",
    "the analysis employed in this paper demonstrates that fluctuation and interaction effects in superconducting contacts with arbitrary transmissions of conducting modes show a number of qualitatively new features as compared to the case of josephson tunnel barriers @xcite .",
    "the main physical reason behind such differences is the presence of subgap andreev bound states ( [ and ] ) inside the system .    in the limit of sufficiently small fluctuations of the josephson phase difference we derived the complete expression for the effective action of superconducting contacts",
    "this expression allowed us to obtain the general result for the equilibrium current - current correlation function describing josephson current noise in such contacts . due to the presence of subgap bound states this current noise essentially depends on the",
    "josephson phase @xmath18 and remains non - zero even in the zero temperature limit and at subgap frequencies .",
    "for instance , in a physically important case of diffusive contacts at @xmath0 the equilibrium current noise spectrum differs from zero at all frequencies exceeding the threshold value @xmath223 and has the form displayed in fig .",
    "2 .    another important effect studied here is capacitance renormalization . while geometric capacitance of superconducting contacts can be small",
    ", retardation effects yield additional `` capacitance - like '' contributions which depend on both the transmission distribution @xmath6 and the josephson phase @xmath18 and can well exceed the geometric capacitance term .",
    "in particular , in the limit @xmath224 the renormalized capacitance was found to diverge in highly transparent and diffusive contacts , see fig .",
    "3 . this behavior differs from that of tunnel junctions @xcite and can also substantially affect the frequency of josephson plasma oscillations , see fig .",
    "finally , our effective action formalism enabled us to analyze the correction to the josephson current due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "provided this coulomb correction @xmath225 remains small as compared to the josephson critical current @xmath15 one finds the universal result @xmath226 where the numerical prefactor @xmath227 depends on the transmission distribution .",
    "this prefactor reaches its maximum value @xmath228 in the case of tunnel barriers and becomes smaller for higher transmissions , e.g. @xmath229 for diffusive contacts . in the case of fully open barriers",
    "the prefactor @xmath227 tends to zero , @xmath230 , implying that no coulomb blockade of the josephson current is expected in such barriers .    our results for the interaction correction , e.g. , eq .",
    "( [ intst ] ) , might explain a rapid change between superconducting and insulating behavior recently observed @xcite in comparatively short metallic wires with resistances close to the quantum resistance unit @xmath231 k@xmath232 in - between two bulk superconductors . previously it was already argued @xcite that such a superconductor - to - insulator crossover can be due to coulomb effects .",
    "our present results provide further quantitative arguments in favor of this conclusion .",
    "let us again stress that in this paper we only considered the limit of relatively short contacts in which case the characteristic thouless energy of the contact @xmath233 exceeds the superconducting order parameter @xmath11 .",
    "in the opposite case of long junctions @xmath234 ( which appears to be more relevant to the experiments @xcite ) the interaction correction to the supercurrent turns out to have the same structure ( [ intst ] ) with @xmath235 substituted by @xmath233 ( see also @xcite ) .",
