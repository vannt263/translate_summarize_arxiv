    "the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy is a satellite of the milky way ( mw ) with an apparent dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) morphology that is , however , distinct in at least two ways .",
    "first , the relative proximity of sgr to the sun ( @xmath4 kpc ) makes its brightest stars quite accessible to study with even relatively modest aperture telescopes .",
    "thus , sgr is open to much more straightforward and extensive examination than its much more distant , counterpart mw satellites making sgr , in principle , a highly approachable , local laboratory for dsph galaxies .",
    "second , sgr represents the most certain and vivid example of a satellite enduring tidal disruption by the mw , with the highest known surface brightness tidal tails among mw dsph satellites .",
    "indeed , not only does no other mw dsph have anywhere near as obvious tidal debris , whether other dsphs are showing any evidence of visible mass loss is still debated for most mw satellites .",
    "for this reason , sgr is often relegated to a `` special case '' category among mw satellites and investigators of the properties of `` classical dsphs '' often avoid sgr because of an uncertainty and wariness of how it fits into the larger dsph context .",
    "obviously prudence dictates care in such matters , but the potential advantages of a much more accessible test laboratory for dsph dynamics makes it worth understanding whether the second of the above two sgr properties ( tidal disruption ) truly nullifies the usefulness of the first ( proximity ) in terms of adopting sgr as a valid prototype for other dsph satellites .",
    "an early analysis of the internal dynamics of sgr was provided by ibata et al .",
    "this impressively assembled early sample of radial velocities numbered some 410 stars using the ctio / argus and aat / autofib spectrographs , and it remains the only fully published wide - spread detailed analysis of the dynamical properties of the sgr galaxy main body . while the area covered provides some strength to look at the larger sgr main body , the limitation of most fields being along the main axis limits further analysis , as does the poor velocity precision of the aat data ( @xmath5 km s@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , many analyses of the dynamics and @xmath6 of this system specifically make use of the single dispersion ( @xmath7 km s@xmath2 ) derived for ibata et al.s database of 114 stars located at the nucleated ( perhaps unrepresentative ) center .",
    "recently , a first analysis of a new aat data set was presented by , pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , based on 1805 sgr members by rv in 6 fields along the major axis and one side of the minor axis of sgr reaching to @xmath8 along the major axis .",
    "this data analysis and modeling focuses primarily on whether rotation is found in sgr .",
    "an improved kinematical analysis of the sgr inner core and attempting to isolate it chemically and kinematically from m54 was conducted by bellazzini et al .",
    "they analyzed 1152 vlt / flames and keck / deimos spectra using rvs and cat metallicities determinations to isolate the sgr core population from that of m54 .",
    "while this provides an excellent analysis of the central core of sgr ( @xmath9 km s@xmath2 ) , the limited area , all within 9 of core , provides just one data point compared to the larger main body of sgr .",
    "of course , understanding the sgr system  among the nearest known examples of a minor merger  is sufficient cause for systematic exploration of its core , whether or not it can be considered a suitable representative of the dsph morphological class in general .",
    "some recent evidence makes a compelling case that the primary difference between sgr and other mw satellites may be principally in its life phase within what may be a universal evolutionary course for dwarf galaxies . in general ,",
    "the star formation histories of dwarf galaxies in the local universe are similar for most of cosmic time , regardless of their present morphological type , with the latter mostly a function of variations in the influence of external mechanisms ( like ram pressure stripping or tidal effects ) within the past gyr or so and that give rise to a strong morphology - density relationship ( skillman et al .",
    "2003 ; grebel 2004 ; weisz et al . 2011 ) .",
    "according to models by mayer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , tidal stirring via close passages around large host galaxies can transform star forming , gas - rich , dwarf irregular ( dirr ) systems with small rotating disks into classical , moribund , gas - depleted , pressure - supported dsphs .",
    "the mechanism driving such a metamorphosis is the formation and decline of a central bar , incited by the dynamical interaction of the satellite with the gravitational potential of the host , particularly at pericenter passages .",
    "certainly it is clear that at least some of the present `` classical '' mw dsphs ( e.g. , carina , leo i ) , though now devoid of gas , were forming stars in the not too distant past ( the past few gyrs ; smecker - hane et al .",
    "2009 ; gallart et al .",
    "2007 )  just like sgr @xcite .",
    "interestingly , carina and leo i may be the two classical mw dsphs apart from sgr with the strongest evidence for tidal disruption ( carina : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "ironically , despite sgr s proximity , less is known about the distribution of properties of stars across the sgr core than for other satellites of the mw , for a variety of potential reasons  e.g. , because of ( 1 ) the tendency of observers to avoid it on grounds that it is perceived to be unusual , as mentioned above , ( 2 ) the fact that sgr has only been relatively recently discovered ( ibata et al .",
    "1994 ) , as well as , probably most importantly , ( 3 ) its intrinsic size at its distance from the sun means that sgr spans a large angle on the sky . even with large field of view , multifiber spectroscopy it is simply difficult to cover the enormous size of the sgr core ( with a semi - major axis length of almost 30 degrees ) . nevertheless , some basic knowledge about the sgr core is , of course , in place .",
    "ibata et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 ) made the first maps showing the extended and elongated nature of the sgr core and determined that it was comparable in size and luminosity to the largest of the mw dsph satellites , the fornax system .",
    "these authors also showed that , like fornax , the sgr system has its own retinue of globular clusters , including m54 , a large globular cluster that is either the very heart , or _ at _ the very heart , of the dsph ( see discussion by bellazzini et al .",
    "2008 ; monaco et al . 2005 ; but also cf .",
    "siegel et al . 2011 ) .",
    "other globular clusters in the galactic halo farther from the sgr core may also be debris from the original satellite ( see review by law & majewski 2010b ) .",
    "majewski et al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter paper i ) assembled the first all - sky view of the sgr dwarf galaxy core along with its tidal tails by identifying constituent m giant stars within the final release two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) point source catalog .",
    "m giants , which are copious in the relatively metal rich ( [ fe / h ] as high as @xmath100.4 ; layden & sarajedini 2000 ) sgr populations , are separable from m dwarfs with @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 photometry ( bessell & brett 1988 ) , and in any case the former well outnumber the latter to 2mass magnitude limits ( e.g. , @xmath14 ) .",
    "the 2mass m giant sample , which is more robust to the differential reddening effects that have made optical studies of sgr core difficult , yielded the first `` clean '' view of the entire main sgr body . from the distribution of the large population of m giants ,",
    "the morphology of the sgr core could be more accurately fit , and majewski et al .",
    "showed that it could be described by a king profile but with , at the largest radii , a break in the king profile due to the presence of its tidal tails .",
    "apart from the fact that sgr shows a small density cusp at its very center , which may or may not ( see monaco et al .",
    "2005 ) be due to the density enhancement provided by the superposition of m54 , the overall king+power law break profile of sgr looks identical to those previously observed in other `` classical '' galactic dsphs ( see fig .  13 below ) ; however , the source of these profile breaks in other dsph systems have been debated as due either to prodigious tidal mass loss or as bound populations expected for the high inferred @xmath6 in these systems ( e.g. , munoz et al.2006 , 2008 ; sohn et al .",
    "2007 ; koch et al . 2007 ; mcconnachie , pearrubia , & navarro 2007 ) .",
    "it is commonly suggested ( e.g. , kroupa 1997 ; kleyna et al .",
    "1999 ) that discrimination of these two models should be possible from the radial velocity ( rv ) dispersion trend with radius .",
    "sgr represents the closest , most accessible dsph in the class of those exhibiting king+break profiles , but it is also the one example where the break is from _ certain _ tidal disruption . thus it provides a rosetta stone by which the dynamical markers of this process may be empirically established .    in the present paper",
    "we undertake the first large , wide - field _ and _ high resolution ( @xmath15 ) spectroscopic survey to sample across the larger area encompassing the core body of the sgr system . with this survey , we explore the velocity distribution of 2mass - selected k and m giant stars across the face of this core , from its very center out to the trailing tidal tail and along the major , minor and other symmetry axes of the system . thus",
    ", with this survey we provide kinematical information for sgr that is comparable in extent to datasets existing for other milky way dsphs .",
    "this enables us to put sgr in a dynamical context with these other systems , and provide a baseline for comparison to a dsph known to be undergoing severe tidal disruption .",
    "our study focuses on two primary observables to provide this context : ( 1 ) within the distribution of radial velocities (  3 ) we look for signatures of rotation and show that sgr , like other dsphs , has no significant rotation signature (  4 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the velocity dispersion profile of sgr is shown to be more or less flat , which is the same trend found in all other dsphs (  5 ) .",
    "thus , in these two properties , sgr is found not to be unusual compared to other dsphs , despite its current state of enduring extreme mass loss ( see , e.g. , paper i ; chou et al .",
    "we comment on the potential significance of this apparent `` normality '' of sgr as a dsph system for the potential state of other dsph systems in  6.2 .",
    "the present survey systematically samples the core of the sgr dsph galaxy with target fields selected primarily along the major and minor axes .",
    "additional pointings along diagonal directions give greater leverage in mapping the kinematical and chemical distributions of the dwarf .",
    "fields were selected to explore the major axis at @xmath162@xmath17 intervals , the minor axis at @xmath161@xmath17 intervals , and the diagonals at + 2@xmath17 and + 4@xmath17 radial separations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sgr_hydra ] ) .",
    "the precise field centers were allowed to shift by a few arcmin to maximize the number of observable targets , as described below .",
    "the potential target stars were selected to be late type giants as identified in dereddened @xmath18 color - magnitude diagrams from the 2mass catalog .",
    "the 2mass photometry was dereddened using the schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) maps , with their @xmath19 values converted to @xmath20 and @xmath21 using the relations given in paper i. the maximum inferred mean reddening in any field was @xmath22 in minor@xmath2305 .",
    "stars that may belong to the sgr red giant branch ( rgb ) were selected using the following color - magnitude region :    * @xmath24 * @xmath25 * @xmath26    this selection was made to isolate the sgr rgb in the sgr core ( e.g. , field major@xmath2300 ) while minimizing the contamination from galactic stars , as shown in figure [ cmddered ] , though distance and metallicity variations can cause the mean rgb color and magnitude to shift which was not accounted for in this study .",
    "spectroscopic data were obtained using the hydra spectrograph on the blanco 4-m telescope at ctio on the nights of 1922 july 2003 and 17 august 2003 under mostly clear skies with good seeing ( estimated 1.2 ) .",
    "data were obtained using 132 fibers that are simultaneously dispersed onto a @xmath27 pixel ccd ( site400 mm ) using the 380 grating ( 1200 lines mm@xmath2 ) and with the fiber ends viewed by the spectrograph through a 100@xmath28 m slit plate to improve the resolution to 0.68   per resolution element ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the spectral range covered was 77408740    and we typically exposed for 60 minutes per field to obtain spectra with signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath29 ) of 5 for stars at the faintest limit of @xmath30 .",
    "potential sgr stars were weighted by magnitude and input to the hydra_assign program that is used to design fiber configurations for the hydra multi - object spectrograph on the blanco 4-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the hydra_assign parameters were set to maximize the number of sgr candidate stars selected , and this was done by testing the total weights for assigned fibers at each field centering for a spatial search grid of @xmath31 with 1@xmath32 steps centered on the nominal field center .",
    "the centers of the actually observed fields using this optimization plan are found in table [ fieldcent ] and shown in figure [ sgr_hydra ] .",
    "along with our target fields , we also observed a selection of radial velocity standard stars .",
    "for each of these rv standards , we obtained multiple observations , where each `` observation '' entails sending the light of the calibrator down 2 - 12 different fibers with slightly differing exposure lengths to be able to measure the trend of velocity precision with data quality .",
    "radial velocities were determined using iraf fxcor , which cross - correlates stellar templates with the object stars based on the methodology of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) . for this study ,",
    "the stellar templates were high - s / n rv standard stars .",
    "the region used in the cross - correlation was 82208680  .",
    "a full discussion of the data reduction and calibration to the iau standard rv system can be found in @xcite ; the present data were obtained on the same nights using the same `` red '' rv standards .    only stars with @xmath29 of 5 or better",
    "were included in the rv analysis .",
    "however , spectral template mismatches also produce poor results , so an additional culling based on the tonry - davis ratio ( tdr @xmath33 3 ) was also employed .",
    "the tdr selection is used over a @xmath29 one because the tdr statistic also accounts for the effects of mismatches ( e.g. , due to temperature / chemistry differences ) of a target star s photosphere with that of the velocity template ; the tdr therefore provides a better correlation to the measured velocity errors .",
    "we determined our velocity uncertainties as fully described in @xcite and adopting the method of vogt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which calibrates the uncertainty as a function of the measured tdr .",
    "this calibration was done independently for each observing run , and we find that our data are on the standard system to within 0.3 km s@xmath2",
    ". for the dynamical analysis presented in this paper , only stars with uncertainties of less than 5 km s@xmath2 are used .",
    "velocities were converted from the measured ( heliocentric ) values to the galactic standard of rest after correcting for earth barycentric motion , assuming a solar motion ( in a right - handed , cartesian coordinate system ) of @xmath34 km s@xmath2 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) , and using the iau value of @xmath35 km s@xmath2 .",

    "the rv members are drawn from the hotter , fainter part of the rgb where the luminosity function yields more potential candidates , including k spectral types .",
    "we select stars likely to be associated with the sgr core based solely on their rvs with respect to the sgr mean .",
    "the field - by - field rv distribution of stars and the ultimate membership selections are shown in figure [ rvhists ] .",
    "likely sgr member stars were selected in each field by using an iterative 3@xmath39 rejection technique including measurement uncertainties as fully described in @xcite . due to the low numbers of sgr members in the outer , lower sgr density fields ( @xmath40 ) a pre - selection ( @xmath41 km s@xmath2 ) was made to eliminate obvious galactic contamination , which is centered around @xmath42 km s@xmath2 .",

    "sgr members selected to this point are those stars falling along the nominal sgr rgb in 2mass cmds and having radial velocities within a reasonable range of expected values for the rather rapidly moving sgr core .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that mw contaminants of identical color - magnitude combination might slip into our `` member '' list if they fall along the extreme tails of the galactic field star velocity distribution .",
    "while we can not identify specific contaminants without further information , we can estimate the expected number of such stars using a model for the mw .    to this end",

    "compared to our `` member '' stars in each field ( col .",
    "6 ) we find the fractional contamination ( col .  7 ) to be a minor effect except in three fields ( minor@xmath1003 , minor@xmath2305 , and nw@xmath2304 ) .",
    "this evaluation of a large contamination fraction in these fields conforms to a simple visual inspection of the scaled besanon rv distributions in these fields ( fig",
    ".  [ rvhists ] ) .",
    "we exclude these three fields from further analysis in this paper .",
    "the velocity data derived in the previous section can be used to profile the trends of mean velocity and velocity dispersion across the sgr core .",
    "first , we compare our _ central _ velocity dispersion to that obtained by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who provide high precision measurements of the inner 9 of sgr and the globular cluster m54 .",
    "we find that our center field velocity dispersion ( major+00 ; @xmath43 km s@xmath2 ) is consistent with the dispersion they derive for sgr _",
    "after _ removing m54 ( @xmath44 km s@xmath2 ) , which is expected given that our selection of stars is over a relatively large area . as a check on the effects that m54 would have , we also calculated the dispersion for the major+00 field after removing the 33 stars in the area covered by bellazzini et al .",
    "( 2008 ; e.g. , 9@xmath32 radius around m54 ) .",
    "the new dispersion ( @xmath45 km s@xmath2 ) shows that m54 has a negligible effect on our derived central velocity dispersion .    the only other large - area rv study of the sgr core , though with lower velocity precision , is that of ibata et al .",
    "most of the ibata et al .",
    "data were obtained using aat / autofib , which resulted in per star uncertainties of @xmath46 km s@xmath2 ( i.e. , of the same order as the sgr core velocity dispersions ) .",
    "this lower precision probably results in the inflated near - center velocity dispersions obtained from these data ( visible , e.g. , in figs .",
    "4 and 6 , gray open squares and open circles ) .",
    "additional data were taken by ibata et al .",
    "with ctio / argus at a higher precision , though the actual resulting uncertainties are not given by these authors ( we estimate them to be @xmath47 km s@xmath2 based on comparison to their repeat observations presented in their table 2(b ) ) .",
    "we find a smaller central velocity dispersion ( @xmath43 km s@xmath2 ) than ibata et al .",
    "km s@xmath2 ) , which , again , is likely explained by the high precision data of our study , and perhaps underestimated velocity errors for the ibata et al .",
    "argus data .",
    "the ibata et al .",
    "data are for stars around the center of sgr with a couple outlying fields that fall near the major axis . for comparison ,",
    "their dispersions are presented in our table  [ tab : rvs ] and projected into the trends of our survey in figures  [ fig : vgsr_r_re ] and [ sgr_hydraa1 ] , which show a good correspondence .",
    "figure  [ fig : vgsr_r_re ] shows the measured velocity and velocity dispersion trends versus both the straight projected radius as well as the elliptical radius ( i.e. , the radius normalized to the semi - major axis along the elliptical density contours using the shape determined in @xcite ) .",
    "we find a declining @xmath49 trend as a function of radius in both @xmath50 and @xmath51 , however this format is not very sensible for interpreting the @xmath49 trend , since it azimuthally averages over a general velocity trend along the satellite , one seen predominantly along the major axis ( see below ) .",
    "the presence of a global @xmath49 trend is evident by the distribution of mean velocities color - coded in the survey map shown in figure  [ sgr_hydra3 ] and discussed further below .",
    "in addition to looking at global radial trends , by exploiting our areal coverage we can explore trends along four different primary axes ( major , minor , sw  ne , and nw  se ) .",
    "this is particularly helpful for looking for a signature of sgr rotation .",
    "ibata et al .  (",
    "1997 ) first looked for evidence that sgr may show rotation along the minor axis as an effect of tidal stripping , after claims for rotation in ursa minor dsph were made ( hargeaves et al .",
    "their data showed no evidence of minor axis rotation .",
    "more recently , pearrubia et al . ( 2010 ) predicted a sgr core rotation as large as 20 km s@xmath2 as a way to `` naturally '' produce a bifurcated leading arm among the sgr tidal debris .",
    "such a bifurcation is one explanation for the apparent double arms of sgr debris in the northern galactic hemisphere `` field of streams '' ( belakurov et al .",
    "our data provide an excellent opportunity to re - verify the ibata et al .",
    "claim for no measured rotation along an even greater span of the main body than they explored , and to test pearrubia et al.s prediction of a rotating sgr core .    to clarify",
    "the trends observed , it is beneficial to explore them as a function of position along the major and minor axes ( figure [ sgr_hydraa1 ] ) as well as along the diagonal ( figure [ sgr_hydrab ] ) axes across the center of sgr .",
    "it is clear that our data show no significant gradient at all along the minor axis , in agreement with the data and suggestion by ibata et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a lack of minor axis rotation .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ sgr_hydraa1 ] shows a clear global velocity gradient along the major axis , which could be a signature of rotation ; however the observed trend is contrary to that proposed by pearrubia et al .",
    "their models suggest that there should be an _ increase _ to @xmath52 km s@xmath2 along the major axis in the trailing arm direction , but we find a _ decrease _ to @xmath53 km s@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , given the large area on the sky spanned by the major axis coverage other possibilities exist to explain these trends besides rotation ; these are fully explored in  [ sec : rot ] below . we see no significant trends in @xmath49 along the other axes available to our survey ( sw  ne and nw  se ) , as explored further below .",
    "pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have conducted their own radial velocity survey of sgr specifically to look for the sgr rotation predicted by their earlier model and thereby test whether rotation can explain bifurcation seen in the sgr tails .",
    "similar to our findings here , these authors only find an rv trend along the major axis , and no evidence of minor axis rotation , though their coverage in more limited and only covers one side of the sgr minor axis . because the individual radial velocities from pearrubia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have not been published , a detailed analysis and comparison between our data sets is not yet possible .      to investigate in detail the kinematical trends seen within the sgr core data ,",
    "it is necessary to distinguish the effects of potential intrinsic rotation from global trends due to the motion of sgr along its orbit , which , due to sgr being observed over a large expanse of sky , leads to strong radial velocity variations as observed from earth .",
    "we therefore construct a two - dimensional velocity map by binning the velocity data into 1 deg@xmath54 bins in the sgr core coordinates , and compare this map to theoretical models .",
    "as shown in figure  [ sgr_2dmap ] ( upper left panel ) , the observational data show a statistically significant velocity gradient along the major axis of sgr , with @xmath55 km s@xmath2 in the major-04 field and @xmath56 km s@xmath2 in the major+12 field . such a trend can be expected even for a non - rotating model however , and reflects the changing projection of the space velocity of sgr stars onto the line of sight with angular position across the dwarf . in figure  [ sgr_2dmap ]",
    "( upper middle panel ) we compare to the velocity trend expected if we were to adopt the simplest possible model for sgr ; namely an extended solid - body translating with space velocity @xmath57 km s@xmath2 ( see law & majewski ( 2010b ) ; lm10 hereafter ) , for which all variation of the radial velocity across the body is due to projection effects .",
    "the trend of radial velocities along the major axis in this simple solid - body model closely resembles the trend in the observational data , although the magnitude of the end - to - end velocity differential is significantly larger ( @xmath58 km s@xmath2 ) than observed ( figure  [ sgr_2dmap ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "a solid - body model is a poor descriptor of real , extended galactic satellites however , because such satellites respond to the galactic gravitational potential and unbound stars have streaming motions along the tidal streams .",
    "a more physically motivated comparison may be made to the @xmath59-body model of sgr presented by lm10 ; this model assumes that sgr was originally an isotropic ( i.e. , non - rotating ) plummer sphere and follows the orbits of the @xmath60 individual tracer particles over the interaction history of the dwarf , thereby accounting for both projection effects and varying space velocities throughout the bound sgr core and unbound tidal streams .- body technique though , the lm10 model actually overshoots the current location of sgr by @xmath61 along its orbit .",

    "according to the proposed scenario , dwarf galaxies like sgr did indeed start out as disky dwarfs systems ( embedded in extended dark matter halos ) , but in the presence of the tidal field of a larger host galaxy like the mw , these systems are transformed into spheroids via formation and subsequent shortening of a bar , and through this process the stellar motions are altered from ordered to random . depending on what phase of this dynamical transformation the dwarf galaxy is viewed , it can be highly elongated ( e.g. , just after bar formation ) to very spherical ( e.g. , much further evolved ) . the best fitting model for the sgr case explored by okas et al .",
    "places the presently observed phase just beyond the second perigalacticon , intermediate between the phase of bar formation at first perigalacticon ( a phase where sgr would have tidal arms too short ) and the third perigalacticon ( a phase where sgr would be spherical ) .",
    "this is the first model to explain both the very large ellipticity of sgr as well as the observed kinematics of its stars , but presupposes that the current sgr orbit is a recent product of dynamical friction from a larger orbit having an apocenter exceeding 100 kpc on which sgr was deposited after cosmological infall into the mw halo .",

    "coincident with the orbital erosion from dynamical friction , the sgr system must have shed a significant amount of mass , mostly dark matter , but also probably baryons , to bring it to its presently smaller size ; a large , lmc - mass progenitor would be required to achieve a significant amount of orbital erosion ( colpi et al .",

    "of course , the lack of any significant rotation in sgr is commensurate with the kinematics of other dsphs .",
    "but , in addition , as figure  [ fig : all_disp ] demonstrates ( data from muoz et al 2005 , 2006 ; walker et al .  2007 ; and sohn et al .  2006 ) , the velocity dispersion profile for sgr as a function of radius for the data presented in this study also strongly imitates those for other mw dsphs . just like the velocity dispersion profiles of the other classical mw dsphs , that of sgr remains more or less flat to large radii , including that part of the system where it is clearly dominated by tidal debris .    as may be seen from the compilation of properties of the classical mw dsph systems in table  [ tab : dwarfs ] , sgr is at one extreme within this group in terms of its distance , luminosity , linear size , ellipticity and derived mass , which might merit it being considered `` exceptional '' among the group .",
    "however , while sgr is the most luminous and most massive dsph , it is not significantly brighter or more massive than fornax , and its central velocity dispersion is similar to those of sculptor , draco , ursa minor , and leo i and less than that of fornax .",
    "sgr also has an extended star formation history , like fornax , carina , sculptor , sextans , leo i and leo ii .",
    "meanwhile , we would argue that sgr s large ellipticity and half - light radius may well be a function of its presently small galactocentric distance : as discussed above (  6.2 ) the ellipticity may be due to the recent infall of the system to a small orbit that induced tidal stirring , whereas the large present size may be due to sgr recently experiencing catastrophic tidal disruption and mass loss , as argued by chou et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    indeed , guided by the remarkable morphological and dynamical similarity of sgr to the other mw dsph systems as well as its compatibility with the tidal stirring model ,",
    "we conclude that sgr may sometimes appear to be a `` dsph outlier '' simply because it is presently in a more flashy , but intermediate phase of a more universal evolutionary sequence from a disky , star - forming ,  lmc - like \" state to a more spherical , staid , dwarf spheroidal state long past active star formation , like the draco system . as shown by okas et al .",
    "( 2010a , 2011 ) , the exact timescale for a dsph to follow this evolution is a function of its mass and orbital size , with the latter , of course , a function of the former through dynamical friction and the zero - age of the evolution set by the epoch of initial infall into the mw . in the case of sgr",
    ", its present relative `` flashiness '' is driven by its currently small orbit ( which amplifies the tidal stirring effect ) , proximity to perigalacticon ( the most dramatic phase of both tidal stirring and mass loss ) , and its having recently formed significant stellar tidal tails ( again , a function of the stronger tidal force experienced on the smaller orbit ) . if star formation history and morphology present ersatz timestamps of this `` universal '' evolutionary sequence ( admittedly crude timestamps , because of the vagaries of viewing perspective , orbital shape , stochasticity of star formation histories , and initial conditions ) , then perhaps the less bar - like ( okas et al . 2012 ) and recently star forming fornax system may be another system in a somewhat earlier phase of transformation , while carina and leo i may be in a somewhat later phase . this proposed paradigm of a universal evolutionary track for tidally - stirred , infalling galaxies is explored in more detail , as a function of more parameters and including all local group galaxies in okas et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "our primary point here is that because sgr offers a clear example _ already found in nature _ of a disrupting dwarf galaxy system containing dm that shares so many properties  e.g. , density profile , lack of rotation , @xmath76 profile  with other classical , dm - filled mw dsphs that it is worth considering that the paradigms of not only tidal influence ( e.g. , stirring ) , but tidal _ disruption _ , may apply more ubiquitously to these other ( classical ) dsphs and that perhaps these other objects are also suffering varying degrees of tidal disruption , along the sgr paradigm .",
    "in fact , as found by okas et al .",
    "( 2010a ) , morphological transformation and mass loss take place together .",

    "if there are two mechanisms responsible for the outer structure and dynamics of dsphs , our results here show that dynamical studies are hard pressed to discriminate them .",
    "moreover , our analysis of the kinematics of the sgr system demonstrate clearly that flat velocity dispersion profiles do _ not _ prove the existence of extended dm halos around dsphs .",
    "on the other hand , tidal tails , seen morphologically and not just inferred from kinematics , prove when extended dm halos are not present .",
    "thus , one clear means by which we might hope to distinguish between structural / dynamical models  i.e. , extended dm halos versus unbound tidal debris  for specific dsphs is to build more extensive and refined morphological maps capable of detecting ( subtle ) tidal tails . a more sensitive and systematic search for evidence of tidal tails around the galactic dsph population would help build tighter empirical constraints on their true masses and help answer the questions of whether dsphs typically live in truly huge ( @xmath84 m@xmath85 ) dm subhalos or smaller ones and what this implies for the efficiency of galaxy formation on these scales ( ferrero et al .",

    "is often portrayed in studies of mw dsphs ( see section 1 ) , we argue that it may not be an anomaly , but rather a rosetta stone of dsph galaxies and their evolution in a mw - like environment . perhaps sgr s only overriding exceptional quality is that it is the mw dsph presently in the most dramatic stages of a universal evolutionary path that includes tidal harassment and tidal disruption .",

    "<S> we have assembled a large - area spectroscopic survey of giant stars in the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy core . using medium resolution ( @xmath0 ) , multifiber spectroscopy we have measured velocities of these stars , which extend up to 12 degrees from the galaxy s center ( 3.7 core radii or 0.4 times the king limiting radius ) . from these high quality spectra we identify 1310 sgr members out of 2296 stars surveyed distributed across 24 different fields across the sgr core . </S>",
    "<S> additional slit spectra were obtained of stars bridging from the sgr core to its trailing tail . </S>",
    "<S> our systematic , large area sample shows no evidence for significant rotation , a result at odds with the @xmath1 km s@xmath2 rotation required as an explanation for the bifurcation seen in the sgr tidal stream ; the observed small ( @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ) velocity trend along primarily the major axis is consistent with models of the projected motion of an extended body on the sky with no need for intrinsic rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the sgr core is found to have a flat velocity dispersion ( except for a kinematically colder center point ) across its surveyed extent and into its tidal tails , a property that matches the velocity dispersion profiles measured for other milky way dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the possible significance of this observed kinematical similarity for the dynamical state of the other classical milky way dsphs in light of the fact that sgr is clearly a strongly tidally disrupted system . </S>"
