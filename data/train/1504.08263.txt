    "research on manganites dates back to the 1950 s , when jonker and van santen@xcite reported the existence of ferromagnetic metallic phase in mixed crystals of manganese oxides lamno@xmath1-camno@xmath1 , lamno@xmath1-srmno@xmath1 , and lamno@xmath1-bamno@xmath1 .",
    "however , the interest of a wide portion of the scientific community was only raised in the 1990s , due to the experimental observation of a colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effect .",
    "@xcite indeed , the relative change in resistivity upon the application of an external magnetic field was much higher than the one observed in artificial magnetic / non - magnetic multilayer systems : up to @xmath3 at room temperature in thin films.@xcite triggering such a cmr , however , requires cooling below the curie temperature @xmath4 and the application of relatively strong magnetic fields , preventing the technical application of the cmr effect to this day .",
    "alternative routes to achieve cmr have also been followed in mixed valence manganites such as the half - doped la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 ( lcmo ) , @xcite which is insulating below @xmath5  k and displays antiferromagnetic and charge order , @xcite often also accompanied by orbital order . indeed",
    ", the antiferromagnetic insulating state is prone to instabilities .",
    "the transition toward a ferromagnetic metallic state can be triggered upon applying a magnetic field,@xcite doping , biaxial strain , pressure,@xcite or an electric field.@xcite the experiments @xcite suggest that the destabilization of the charge - orbital order can also be obtained upon size reduction .",
    "in fact , it was observed also in nd@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 @xcite and sm@xmath6ca@xmath7mno@xmath8 @xcite in both at half - doping and in asymmetrically doped samples , as well as in pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath8 @xcite compounds .",
    "nonetheless , there remains some controversy @xcite arising from the experimental difficulty to disentangle the effects of size reduction from other effects , such as oxygen non - stoichiometry , disorder , strain etc .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the effects of size reduction has been studied by density functional theory ( dft)+u @xcite and dft+dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) .",
    "@xcite the theoretical analysis is in remarkable agreement with the experiments and shows a correlation - driven destabilization of the charge - orbital order in bulk lcmo upon size reduction .",
    "this bears the prospects that , for the optimized size , a much smaller magnetic field is sufficient to trigger a cmr , as lcmo nanoclusters can be tuned to the verge of a metal - insulator transition .",
    "hitherto , the dft+dmft calculations on this topic , e.g. , those reported in ref .  , were performed for bulk model systems with _ ab - initio _ parameters . that is , following the dft calculations for @xmath2  nm clusters , model bulk systems were constructed having the same unit cell volume as well as octahedral distortion as in the core of @xmath2  nm cluster .",
    "this way , it was possible to take into account the interplay between strong electronic correlations within dmft and the structural distortions induced by size reduction , obtained _ ab - initio _ through atomic relaxation within dft . in this paper , we take a significant step forward , in terms of carrying out nanoscopic dmft calculations for few - atom clusters with a dft - derived tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "this gives us the opportunity to consider the effect of size reduction from bulk to intermediate - sized clusters to few - atom clusters .",
    "our calculations show an interesting evolution from the high - temperature paramagnetic insulating ( pi ) state in the bulk to a paramagnetic metallic ( pm ) state in intermediate - sized clusters to re - entrant insulating solution for few - atom clusters .",
    "we also investigate the effects of applied hydrostatic pressure in the bulk , which turn out to be different than the effects of size reduction . considering few - atom clusters ,",
    "we also show that electron doping , through the application of external gate voltage , drives an unexpected site- and orbital - selective mott transition .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we discuss the model employed for the description of mixed - valence manganites , and we describe the strategy we followed to include structural , finite - size , and many - body effects in the framework of a combined dft+dmft approach . in sec .",

    "manganites , r@xmath6a@xmath9mno@xmath1 with r being a trivalent rare - earth - metal element and a a divalent dopant , have a perovskite lattice structure , with the rare - earth atoms at corner positions , the mn atoms at body center positions and oxygen atoms at the face centered positions .",
    "depending on the sizes of r and a , given by the so - called tolerance factor , the mno@xmath10 octahedra can tilt and rotate reducing the symmetry of the perovskite lattice from cubic to orthorhombic . with nominal oxygen valency o@xmath11 , in half - doped compounds",
    "( i.e. , @xmath12 ) the manganite atoms are in a mixed valent mn@xmath13 state .",
    "this can lead to a charge disproportionation between the mn sites in bulk half - doped manganites ; in the extreme case one has a 50% of mn@xmath14 sites with a @xmath15 configuration , and the other 50% of mn@xmath16 sites with a @xmath17 configuration .",
    "the charge - ordered state is associated with a real space ordering of mn@xmath16/mn@xmath14 species in a 1:1 pattern .",
    "the octahedral crystal field surrounding the mn ions splits the @xmath18 orbitals into three low energy @xmath19 orbitals ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) and two higher energy @xmath23 orbitals ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) . due to the strong hund s exchange coupling , the three mn electrons of mn@xmath14 occupy the @xmath19 orbital , in a high - spin @xmath26 configuration . the consequent energy gain associated to this state ,",
    "makes it energetically favorable for the extra electron of mn@xmath16 to occupy the doubly degenerate @xmath23 states .",
    "hence , the charge ordering accommodates a static jahn - teller distortion at the mn@xmath16 sites , removing the degeneracy and lowering the symmetry of the system to monoclinic .",

    "the stoichiometry of the system is maintained in the construction of the nano - clusters , as discussed in refs . and .",
    "a necessary step for the subsequent dmft calculation is the extraction of the relevant tight - binding parameters , calculated _ ab initio _ within dft . to achieve this",

    "we observe the opposite trend : driven by the quantum confinement , there is a second metal(@xmath2  nm)-to - insulator(few atoms ) transition and an enhancement of both charge and orbital disproportionation .",
    "we also investigated the effect of electron doping on the few - atom nanoclusters by applying an external gate voltage .",
    "we observe an orbital - selective mott transition at a critical value of the gate voltage which corresponds to an integer filling of only an individual @xmath23 orbital .",
    "the orbital - selective nature of the transition is a direct consequence of the orbital polarization and the strong hund s exchange splitting . at the same time",
    ", the strong charge disproportionation between mn@xmath16 and mn@xmath14 sites induces also a site - selective character , with different mn kinds turning insulating at different values of the gate voltage .",
    "our theoretical prediction of a reentrant insulator - to - metal - to - insulator transition and the reported gate voltage control calls for further experiments . technical applications",
    "are discernible since these two control parameters should allow us to fine tune lcmo nanoclusters to the verge of a mott transition .",
    "in this situation smallest changes in temperature , voltage , magnetic field etc .   can trigger a gigantic change in conductance .",
