    "it is well known that soft hadron - hadron scattering can be described by regge phenomenology , which models the total , elastic and single and double diffractive dissociation cross sections in terms of reggeon and pomeron exchange  @xcite . at high energies ,",
    "it is the pomeron exchange mechanism that dominates the total cross section  @xcite .",
    "however , until recently , our understanding of the pomeron in terms of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite remained fragmentary , at best .",
    "the observation of events with a large rapidity gap in the hadronic final state at hera  @xcite , which are attributed to diffractive dissociation of ( virtual ) photons , led to a renewed interest in the study of the underlying dynamics of diffraction . in deep inelastic @xmath0 scattering , the long hadronic lifetime of the photon at small bjorken-@xmath1 allows to make the link with diffractive dissociation in hadron - hadron scattering , while the presence of one or more hard scales , such as the ( variable ) virtuality @xmath2 , enables perturbative calculations in qcd .    in the framework of qcd , it is tempting to attribute a partonic structure to the pomeron  @xcite ; an approach which proves to be very successful in describing various aspects of diffractive virtual photon disscociation .",
    "qcd calculations indicate , however , that the pomeron does not exhibit a universal behaviour over the full kinematic range .",
    "indeed , experimentally a transition is observed when going from the soft to the hard scattering regime ; the effective intercept of the pomeron trajectory changes from 1.08 in the soft limit to 1.2 in harder interactions .",
    "early experimental measurements at hera of the inclusive cross section  @xcite led to the conclusion that a partonic pomeron would be dominated by hard gluons .",
    "this has been confirmed by investigations of the hadronic final state of diffractive photon dissociation ranging from the study of inclusive particle spectra to exclusive hard jet and open charm production  @xcite .",
    "this article presents recent high precision measurements of the inclusive diffractive deep inelastic cross section in an increased region of phase space .",

    "in addition to the usual dis kinematic variables , the photon virtuality @xmath2 and the bjorken scaling variables @xmath1 and @xmath3 , in the case of diffractive dis one introduces the variables @xmath4 and @xmath5 , defined respectively as the longitudinal momentum fraction of the proton carried by the colourless exchange causing the rapidity gap , and the longitudinal momentum fraction of the colourless exchange carried by the struck quark .",
    "the variable @xmath5 in the @xmath6 is a generic label for the colourless exchange , which in some models is identified as the pomeron .",
    "] collision is analogous to bjorken-@xmath1 in @xmath7 interactions .     in bins of @xmath5 and for different @xmath4 values .",

    "the preliminary results are presented as a reduced cross section , @xmath8 , defined through @xmath9 and divided by the `` pomeron flux '' @xmath10 .",
    "this reduced cross section is equal to the conventional diffractive structure function , @xmath11 , up to corrections due the longitudinal structure function , @xmath12 .",
    "the pomeron flux factor is obtained from a parametrization of the @xmath4 dependence of the cross section inspired by regge theory .",
    "the parametrization works well , as can be seen from the overlap of data points at the same @xmath5 and @xmath2 values obtained for different proton momentum losses @xmath4 .",
    "the intercept of the pomeron trajectory extracted from this data is @xmath13 positive scaling violations are observed in most of the phase space , suggesting a large gluon content of the diffractive exchange .",
    "the ratio of the diffractive to inclusive dis cross sections is found to be reasonably flat at fixed @xmath1 as a function of @xmath2 , indicating that the same scaling violations occur in both processes .",

    "the zeus collaboration has recently installed a new `` forward plug '' calorimeter which covers the range in pseudorapidity @xmath16 and increases the measurable range in mass of the proton dissociation system , @xmath17 , to 2.3 gev and hence reduces the background due to proton dissociation .",
    "preliminary results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeusfpc ] .",
    "it can be observed that in the resonance production region ( where the mass of the photon dissociation system , @xmath15 , is smaller than 2 gev ) there is little dependence on the hadronic mass @xmath14 , while a strong rise with @xmath14 is observed at higher @xmath15 for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "this rise is compatible with the energy dependence of inclusive data .",
    "using a parametrization based on chebychev polynomials at a starting scale of @xmath18 , quark and gluon densities have been fitted to the observed h1 cross section by applying the dglap evolution equations .",
    "subleading reggeon exchanges are included assuming the structure function of the pion .",

    "a model that does not use the notion of a pomeron at all is the soft colour interaction ( sci ) model  @xcite . instead",
    ", the standard matrix element and parton shower description of deep inelastic scattering is used , which , at low bjorken-@xmath1 , is dominated by boson - gluon fusion . in addition , non - perturbative interactions affect the final colour connections between partons , while leaving the parton momenta unchanged .",
    "this may result in an interruption of the colour strings between partons , thus creating a large rapidity gap in the final state .",

    "figure  [ fig : sci ] compares the sci model to recently obtained data at large @xmath2 . while the application of a `` generalized area law '' ( gal ) , which favours soft colour interactions that make the colour strings between partons shorter , clearly improves the description of the data ( as is also observed at lower @xmath2 ) , systematic deviations occur towards low values of @xmath5 .      in this and the subsequent model ,",
    "the virtual photon is considered to fluctuate into partonic configurations , e.g. @xmath23 or @xmath24 . in the proton rest frame and at low bjorken-@xmath1 , this happens long before the actual interaction with the proton .",

    "this qcd model  @xcite describes the elastic scattering of @xmath23 and @xmath24 states off the proton through the exchange of two gluons in a net colour - singlet configuration .",
    "the perturbative calculation requires large transverse momenta of all outgoing partons and @xmath31 to avoid the valence quark region in the proton .        despite these restrictions , fig .",
    "[ fig:2gluon ] shows that the model describes the data rather well .",
    "high precision measurements of the diffractive reduced cross section in deep inelastic scattering have been performed by the h1 and zeus collaborations in an increased region of phase space .",
    "the data support regge factorization ( provided subleading trajectories can contribute ) with a value for the pomeron intercept which is larger than for the soft pomeron .",
