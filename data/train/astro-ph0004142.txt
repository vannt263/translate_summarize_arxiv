    "in order to identify @xmath0 binaries ( wielen et al . 1999a ) we compare the hipparcos proper motions ( esa 1997 ) , which are quasi - instantaneously measured within about three years , with long - term averaged , mean proper motions , which are derived by using ground - based data from a much longer observational period ( often a century or more ) . if the difference @xmath0 between the short - term and the long - term proper motion is statistically significant , the object is probably a binary or a multiple system .",
    "the statistical significance of @xmath0 is measured by the test parameter @xmath1 .",
    "if the errors of the proper - motion components were independent of the directions , @xmath1 would be equal to @xmath0/(mean error of @xmath0 ) .",
    "we take into account the non - isotropy of the errors of @xmath0 and the correlations between the components of @xmath0 .",
    "a value of @xmath2 3.44 corresponds to the same error probability as the familiar two - sided 3@xmath3 criterion , and is therefore used by us for identifying @xmath0 binaries .",
    "the long - term averaged proper motions are partially taken from available astrometric catalogues ; partially they are derived from the mean positions given in the ground - based catalogues and the positions in the hipparcos catalogue ( we call this proper motion @xmath4 ) .",
    "the ground - based catalogues are corrected for systematic errors by comparing them with the hipparcos catalogue .    for determining various values of @xmath0 with respect to hipparcos",
    ", we have used the following astrometric catalogues : fk5 ( fricke et al . 1988 , 1991 ) , rsup ( schwan et al .",
    "1993 ) , gc ( boss et al .",
    "1937 ) , and tycho-2 ( hoeg et al . 2000 ) .",
    "more details will be given in other papers .",
    "for the basic fk5 stars , part i of the fk6 ( wielen et al .",
    "1999b ) gives already many additional informations ( see also url : http://www.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/fk6 ) .",
    "a finding list for about 4000 @xmath0 binaries is given in the internet under url +       + in a machine - readable format .",
    "the list gives identification numbers , @xmath6 values , and other informations on these @xmath0 binaries .",
    "for many of these objects , the probable duplicity was hitherto unknown .",
    "the highest fraction of @xmath0 binaries occurs among the basic fundamental stars , because their proper motions are most accurately measured . among the fainter stars , the fraction of identified @xmath0 binaries is smaller , due to the larger measuring errors .",
    "the highest sensitivity of our @xmath0 method for detecting binaries is reached for nearby stars .",
