    "the notorious difficulty of computing strong interaction quantities from first principles leads directly to a multitude of models , methods , and approximations .",
    "qcd lore dictates that inclusive rates , _",
    "i.e. _ , those for which we do not inquire about any detail of the final hadronic state , are given to good approximation by the corresponding rate in a theoretical world of unconfined , perturbative final - state quarks .",
    "this lore , known as `` quark - hadron duality '' is seldom shown to follow from first principles . in some cases , such as the rate of @xmath1 hadrons ,",
    "an operator product expansion can be used to demonstrate the lore for quantities in which one averages over the energy of the final - state hadronic system .",
    "this is the so - called `` global '' duality , in contrast to duality for unaveraged quantities , or `` local '' duality .",
    "quark - hadron duality applied to decays of heavy mesons permits the computation of many important quantities , such as meson lifetimes , hadronic branching fractions , and the average number of charm quarks per beauty quark decay .",
    "one must note that the duality used here is of the `` local '' variety , and therefore less likely to be valid .",
    "indeed , the sizeable deviations between theoretical predictions utilizing this form of duality and experiment for lifetimes , branching fractions and charm countings suggest that either there are large corrections to duality , or worse , that the duality lore simply does not apply in this context .    in this paper",
    "we study whether duality holds for annihilation decays of heavy mesons in a highly simplified but soluble strongly interacting theory ; in a previous paper@xcite we explored this issue for spectator decays of heavy mesons .",
    "we also investigate the validity of duality in the interference between spectator and annihilation decays .    to inquire about duality in a model",
    ", one must require that the model exhibits permanent quark confinement and asymptotic freedom ; the former is necessary for a meaningful definition of purely hadronic properties , while the latter is believed to be the main ingredient of duality .",
    "the t  hooft model is a good candidate : it satisfies these requirements and behaves , in many other respects , much like the real world of strong interactions .",
    "perhaps still the most straightforward and frequently used model of strong interactions is the constituent quark model , in which hadrons are envisioned as consisting of confined but otherwise weakly interacting valence quarks .",
    "although deep inelastic scattering experiments clearly show that the true structure of a hadron incorporates a much more complicated brew of gluons and sea quarks , the undeniable success of the quark model in predicting hadronic spectra or enumerating decay modes still leads researchers to apply this scheme immediately when approaching a new hadronic system .    the asymptotically free parton result , _ i.e. _ , the result of the valence quark model dressed with perturbative qcd corrections , is also the leading term in an operator product expansion@xcite ( ope ) , in those cases where an ope is known to exist , such as deep inelastic lepton - hadron scattering@xcite and @xmath2 annihilation@xcite , as well as semileptonic processes involving heavy quarks@xcite",
    "one feature held in common by these processes is the presence of a large mass or energy scale , which provides the inverse expansion parameter of the ope ; consequently , it is tempting to suppose that other processes with large scales also possess opes .",
    "such is the case for the nonleptonic decays of @xmath3 mesons , where an ope in powers of @xmath4 is purported to exist@xcite .    as of the time of this writing",
    ", measurements of many of these exclusive channels at cleo and lep are being performed for the first time .",
    "apart from the intrinsic value of such information , nonleptonic @xmath3 decays are expected to provide valuable insights into qcd , magnitudes of ckm elements , and cp violation ; consequently , understanding these decays has become the focus of much recent theoretical work .",
    "but the theoretical situation is wide open , precisely because no part of the decay is free of the complications of strong interaction physics .    when applied to a @xmath5 meson , the lore of quark model calculations or the expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite declares that the inclusive decay width should be dominated by the ( color - unsuppressed ) `` tree '' diagram t ( fig .  1 )",
    ", in which the @xmath6 quark decays to a lighter flavor by emission of a @xmath7 , particularly as @xmath8 .",
    "the daughter quark of the @xmath6 then combines with the spectator antiquark to form one meson , whereas the quark - antiquark pair from the nonleptonic decay of the @xmath9 form another .",
    "the above process assumes factorization , which means that the @xmath9 system and daughter - spectator systems are regarded as non - interacting after the initial weak vertex .",
    "one very interesting comparison that can be made at this point is between the width obtained by the sum of such diagrams in fig .  1 regarded as hadronic decays and the corresponding free quark decay . of course ,",
    "such a diagram is but one possibility , even in the simple quark model .",
    "for example , the spectator antiquark and the antiquark from the @xmath7 decay may trade places before hadronization , the `` color - suppressed '' tree diagram c ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "such an amplitude is suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 , the number of qcd color charges , compared to the t amplitude , since the @xmath9 is a color singlet ; thus , the color indices are automatically suitable for creating colorless mesons in fig .  1 , but require rearrangement in fig .  2",
    ". of course , in a real meson there may be additional dynamical enhancements or suppressions , and moreover , the exchange of _ any _ number of gluons and color charge between the quarks on opposite sides of the @xmath9 line may completely muddle the hierarchy based on large @xmath0 counting .",
    "likewise , the `` annihilation '' amplitude a ( fig .",
    "3 ) , in which the valence quark - antiquark pair of the @xmath5 annihilate to a @xmath9 ( quantum numbers permitting ) , is assumed to be suppressed compared to the t amplitude because of the difficulty of the @xmath6 quark and the antiquark `` finding '' each other in the meson in order to annihilate .",
    "quantitatively , this probability is proportional to the square of the meson wave function at vanishing quark separation , @xmath10 ( the van royen - weisskopf relation ) . to compare this probability with that of the t diagram ,",
    "one then argues that the only remaining dimensionful quantity that can be used to form a probability is @xmath11 , so that the relative probability of an annihilation to a tree process is @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , other concerns lead one to believe that the annihilation and other non - spectator diagrams may be more important than one would naively expect .",
    "for , if non - interacting spectator diagrams dominate decays of @xmath6 hadrons , how then does one explain the fact that the lifetime of @xmath5 mesons is greater than that of @xmath13 baryons by 30% or more@xcite ?",
    "one possible explanation is that the naive estimate of the previous paragraph fails to include potentially large numerical coefficients .",
    "this point of view has been voiced recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it is suggested that the annihilation width has an unexpected additional enhancement of 16@xmath14 compared to the tree width .",
    "one obtains this result by application of perturbative unitarity of the s - matrix to a cut across loop diagrams ( figs .",
    "4@xmath15,@xmath6 ) .",
    "since the diagram giving rise to the tree width requires an additional loop integration compared to that for the annihilation width , the latter is enhanced by a relative factor of 16@xmath14 ( multiplied by the original factor @xmath16 ) .",
    "but is such an effect genuine ?",
    "as soon as one includes the gluon lines necessary to bind real mesons , the counting of loops no longer leads to an obvious enhancement , unless we impose another hierarchy to suppress the effects of these exchanged gluons .",
    "the difficulty originates , as always , in our inability to take into account the multitude of gluons and virtual quarks involved in the strong coupling of mesons .",
    "a question similar in spirit is that of the sense in which the partonic annihilation diagram fig .",
    "3 exhibits quark - hadron duality with its corresponding sum of exclusive hadronic channels .",
    "just as it is expected that the width obtained from the tree diagram fig .",
    "1 approaches its corresponding sum of exclusives as the heavy quark mass becomes large , one may study whether this is true for processes in which the quantum numbers of the quarks are such that an annihilation diagram but not a tree diagram is permitted .",
    "unfortunately , the determination of definitive solutions to these questions requires one to have in hand exact solutions of qcd , and so is currently out of reach .",
    "however , there does exist a simpler universe in which qcd can be solved exactly , so that we may consider the problem of meson decays in either quark or hadron language . as t  hooft showed long ago@xcite ,",
    "the green functions of qcd in one spatial and one time dimension ( 1 + 1 ) in the limit of @xmath17 are completely calculable . despite these large modifications from our universe ,",
    "the t  hooft model remains a nontrivial theory that possesses the attractive feature of realizing confinement by binding quark - antiquark pairs into color - singlet mesons ( and more generally , forbidding colored states@xcite ) , as well as asymptotic freedom and the many phenomenological results of large-@xmath0 qcd@xcite common to our @xmath18 universe , such as dominance of scattering amplitudes by diagrams with a minimum of meson states , ozi suppression , the absence of exotics , and others@xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the analogue of @xmath5 weak nonleptonic decays in 1 + 1 , where `` @xmath5 '' means a meson with a heavy quark ( `` @xmath6 '' ) of mass @xmath19 and a light antiquark of mass @xmath20 ; `` heavy '' and `` light '' quark are terms made more precise in sec .  [ review ] .",
    "we studied the question of quark - hadron duality for the tree diagram in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which it was shown that agreement between the two pictures as @xmath21 occurred in a subtle and surprising manner with such high precision that the discrepancy between the two yielded a remarkable result : a correction to the born term partonic limit well - fit numerically by a term of relative order @xmath22 .",
    "encouraged by this result , we ask what may be learned from other topologies of feynman diagrams .",
    "we study in detail the annihilation diagram and compare the total width with that obtained from the parton model .",
    "our motivation , as before , is the hope that the results from a soluble theory quite similar to real qcd in some respects and quite different in others may shed light on the full four - dimensional problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ diags ] with an enumeration of the various quark diagram topologies and study the scaling of each in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "this classification is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "we find that , in the decays of interest , naive @xmath0 power counting at the diagram level is subtle and deserves special discussion .",
    "the annihilation diagram emerges as the dominant topology and is the one whose computation is studied in the subsequent portion of the paper . in sec .",
    "[ review ] , we briefly review the more arcane features of 1 + 1 dimensional physics and the t  hooft model that are particularly relevant to the subsequent calculations .",
    "section  [ inc ] exhibits the algebraic results of the inclusive parton - level calculation of widths , from both a naive tree - level diagram and an analysis based on loop diagrams as in fig .  4@xmath6 ,",
    "the latter being related closely to the corresponding ope - like expansion . in sec .",
    "[ exc ] , we present the results of the width calculation through exclusive hadronic channels in the t  hooft model .",
    "section  [ res ] gives our numerical results and a discussion of their implications , and sec .",
    "[ conc ] concludes .",
    "a short appendix discusses the van royen - weisskopf relation in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "in order to obtain green functions for exclusive decays in the t  hooft model , one must first decide which diagrams are present at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known , @xmath23-meson couplings in large @xmath0 appear with a suppression factor @xmath24 , and therefore the leading meson decay diagrams are those producing only two final - state mesons .",
    "however , for some diagram topologies there is the possibility of direct oscillation of the @xmath5 meson into a single highly excited meson of the same mass .",
    "such resonant production poses an interesting problem of large @xmath0 counting , as we discuss below .",
    "next , we consider the relevant diagrams in terms of quarks , gluons , and electroweak bosons , in order to count factors of @xmath0 appearing in these diagrams .",
    "to lowest order in electroweak coupling , a single gauge boson is required ; moreover , since we require the decay of a quark , the boson must be a flavor - changing @xmath9 rather than a @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "it is convenient to classify all possible diagram topologies according to six classes given by ref .",
    "@xcite , since these account for all possible diagrams including only one electroweak gauge boson .",
    "the categories include the color - unsuppressed tree diagram t ( fig .  1 ) , the color - suppressed tree diagram c ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the annihilation diagram a ( fig .",
    "3 ) , the electroweak `` exchange '' diagram e ( fig .",
    "5@xmath15 ) , the `` penguin '' diagram p ( fig .",
    "5@xmath6 ) , and the `` penguin annihilation '' diagram pa ( fig .",
    "5@xmath27 ) . for the p diagram exhibited in fig .",
    "5@xmath6 it should be noted that the gluon may instead attach directly to the spectator antiquark , in which case production of an additional quark - antiquark pair is not required .",
    "similarly , the pa topology includes diagrams in which the intermediate glue connects to a single final - state @xmath28 pair .",
    "although these diagrams were originally exhibited in the context of quark model calculations , they suit our purposes since the inclusion of each additional meson , quark - antiquark pair , or external gluon is accompanied by suppressions in the amplitude of orders @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , diagrams with internal gluons are either nonplanar and hence suppressed by powers of 1/@xmath31 , or planar and produce a diagram at most of the same order in @xmath0 as the diagram obtained when all such gluons are removed .",
    "thus , the simple diagrams displayed in the figures are representatives of those with the leading behavior in @xmath0 for each possible topology .",
    "the electroweak gauge boson does not carry color charge , and so the possible diagrams fall into two categories : those in which the boson connects two otherwise disjoint color loops , and those in which the boson begins and ends on quarks already connected by gluons and therefore within a single color loop structure . clearly , the former diagrams boast one extra color loop , and thus dominate the latter by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "the former set consists only of the t and a diagrams , whereas the latter set includes c , e , p , and pa diagrams . only for t and a diagrams",
    "does the amplitude factorize into a product of a decay constant and the matrix element of a current between two mesons . finally , forming a color - singlet meson for the one initial and two final mesons brings in a factor of @xmath32 for each amplitude , and so we find that the amplitude is @xmath33 for t and a , @xmath34 for c , e , and p , and @xmath35 for pa .",
    "widths are obtained by squaring the amplitudes and folding in phase space as usual , which adds no powers of @xmath0 since meson masses and momenta scale as @xmath36 . for reasons that will presently become transparent ,",
    "let us refer to the above as `` naive '' @xmath0 power counting .",
    "suppose , however , that a given diagram topology permits a resonant flavor - changing transition into a _",
    "meson , to which we may assign the label `` one - meson decay . ''",
    "such diagrams clearly dominate over those of the corresponding two - meson decay by a factor of @xmath37 in amplitude . therefore ,",
    "t  hooft model ( or indeed any large @xmath0 ) studies of the two - meson decay mode for such diagrams appear doomed since the t  hooft model presents results only for behavior at leading order in @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the one - meson decay is a very strange physical process .",
    "for such a transition to occur on - shell , the final - state light - quark meson must have precisely the same mass as the initial heavy - light meson .",
    "the weak decay width as a function of @xmath19 to lowest order in @xmath0 is then a series of delta function spikes ( since the strong decay widths of the light quark mesons scale as @xmath30 ) , with a nonzero value if and only if @xmath19 is tuned just right to produce such a light quark meson . in this picture , a continuum width appears only at relative order @xmath38 , when two - body decays are permitted .",
    "clearly , this is an unsatisfactory physical picture .",
    "it implies that the leading behavior of the weak decay width scales as @xmath39 for some integer @xmath23 if @xmath19 is tuned to certain special values , but scales as @xmath40 otherwise .",
    "the simple large @xmath0 diagram counting appears to have failed us .",
    "fortunately , it is not difficult to develop a useful and consistent physical interpretation for such situations . the salient point is to consider @xmath0 very large but still finite , so that strong widths of light - quark mesons are not strictly zero ; indeed , the usual @xmath0 counting shows that their @xmath41 strong widths are exactly what one obtains from strong decays into two lighter mesons .",
    "thus , the one - meson decays may be interpreted as intermediate states in the decay of the initial heavy - light meson through a single resonance into the final two - meson state .",
    "effectively , in this picture one integrates out the one - particle decay resonant channels , which dominate the nonresonant two - particle weak decay widths by @xmath42 , from the hadronic lagrangian .",
    "however , unitarity demands that the extra power of @xmath0 must appear somewhere in the remaining degrees of freedom , and this is accomplished through breit - wigner resonances appearing in the two - meson continuum at points where the mass of the initial heavy - light meson and light - light resonance are equal .",
    "the single meson decays have thus achieved the same interpretation as the @xmath43 peak in the @xmath44 continuum .    despite this natural interpretation ,",
    "it is important to see explicitly that it supports the correct large @xmath0 counting .",
    "let us suppose that a certain class of diagrams gives a naive one - meson weak decay width of order @xmath39 for certain special choices of @xmath19 .",
    "the equivalent resonant two - meson decay diagram has a naive amplitude of order @xmath45 ( and hence a naive width @xmath46 ) , and includes a propagator of the form qcd , it does not matter whether @xmath47 or @xmath48 is chosen as the coefficient of @xmath49 in the propagator .",
    "we have found that this statement is empirically true in our numerical simulations . ]",
    "@xmath50 where the initial meson has mass @xmath48 , and the resonance , labeled by @xmath51 , has mass @xmath47 and strong width @xmath52 .",
    "unless @xmath53 is very close to @xmath54 , the propagator is @xmath55 and the naive large @xmath0 counting is maintained .",
    "however , when @xmath56 the previously suppressed factor @xmath49 becomes dominant and promotes the propagator to a quantity of order @xmath42 .",
    "the question becomes , how much area lies under this breit - wigner ? to answer this , we note that the relevant quantity in the width is the propagator squared .",
    "since the peak is very tall and narrow , the rest of the invariant amplitude varies little over the width of the peak , and thus may be treated as an overall constant .",
    "we may then extend the limits of the integral in @xmath53 from the immediate @xmath41 neighborhood of @xmath54 to all values @xmath57 . noting that @xmath58 the total weak width becomes @xmath59 , and we see that the large @xmath0 counting and unitarity are preserved , exactly as claimed .",
    "more precisely , if the product @xmath60 of the invariant amplitude ( except for the propagator ) , phase space and whatever measure we choose for the integration over @xmath53 is a smooth function in the neighborhood of @xmath47 , then @xmath61 it follows that the @xmath0 counting for two - meson decay diagrams must be modified when it is possible within the topology class to have a final state consisting of a sole color - singlet @xmath62 pair .",
    "the a and e diagrams , and those subsets of p and pa diagrams singled out above , satisfy these criteria . in such cases , the width is promoted by one power of @xmath0 over the result of naive power counting .",
    "we obtain finally the large @xmath0 hierarchy for diagram topologies summarized in table  1 .",
    "we see that the a diagram actually dominates over the t diagram studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by one power of @xmath0 , precisely because resonance intermediates enhance the former and not the latter .",
    "however , in order for both diagrams to appear in a single process , certain restrictions on the flavors of quarks in the mesons must be imposed .",
    "this assignment must be performed with some care , because in the general case one may have to deal with the statistics of identical mesons . in order to base our conclusions on as simple a system as possible , in the present work",
    "we have chosen flavors so that such identical final - state mesons do not occur . in terms of the labels in the t diagram of figs .",
    "6@xmath15 and the a diagram of 6@xmath6 , we choose parton 1 to be the heavy quark `` @xmath6 '' of mass @xmath19 , partons 3 and 4 to refer to identical light quarks , and 2 , 3 (= 4 ) , and 5 to be quarks degenerate with mass @xmath20 but of different flavors . in terms",
    "perhaps more familiar , this means that a `` @xmath5 '' meson with flavor content @xmath63 decays to two `` pion '' excitations with flavors @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and hypothetical @xmath68 quarks are degenerate in mass .",
    "similar assignments may be used to permit certain topologies and forbid others .",
    "a review of the application of the t  hooft model and a description of the interesting physical peculiarities of 1 + 1 dimensions appears in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we reprise only those properties essential to understanding the exceptional features of our results presented below .",
    "the t  hooft model is defined as su(@xmath69 yang - mills theory in 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions with both adjoint ( gluon ) and fundamental ( quark ) degrees of freedom in the limit of infinite group rank @xmath70 .",
    "this definition leads to a theory in which those feynman diagrams with leading dependence in @xmath0 may be summed explicitly to give closed - form expressions that are numerically , if not analytically , soluble .",
    "the archetype of these expressions is the solution for the two - point irreducible green function , the t  hooft equation : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the @xmath23th meson eigenfunction for a quark - antiquark pair of masses @xmath19 , @xmath20 , while @xmath73 is the meson mass eigenvalue , @xmath74 is the fraction of the meson momentum carried by the quark in light - cone coordinates , and @xmath75 indicates quark mass renormalization : @xmath76 note that gauge couplings in 1 + 1 dimensions have units of ( mass)@xmath77 , and recall the usual t  hooft scaling of the strong coupling @xmath78 . from ( [ mren ] )",
    "it then follows that @xmath79 serves as the natural unit of mass in the t  hooft model , and this redefinition has already been used in eq .",
    "( [ the ] ) .",
    "indeed , this scale serves much the same purpose in 1 + 1 as @xmath80 in 3 + 1 , in that heavy quark scaling properties set in for quark masses a few times @xmath81@xcite .",
    "meson wavefunction solutions to the t  hooft equation are either pseudoscalars or scalars , since rotations do not exist in one spatial dimension except in the residual form of spatial inversion .",
    "that three - point t  hooft model green functions may be expressed in terms of two - point functions was first shown by einhorn@xcite , with various generalizations demonstrated by grinstein and mende@xcite .",
    "the method@xcite of numerically solving the t  hooft equation is discussed in sec .",
    "[ res ] , and described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the most remarkable characteristic distinct to 1 + 1 physics exhibited by these calculations is that two - particle phase space actually becomes singular as @xmath82 when the threshold @xmath83 is approached , where @xmath84 is the cm spatial momentum of either outgoing meson .",
    "nevertheless , these turn out to be rather weak square root singularities in the heavy quark mass @xmath19 and therefore have pronounced effects on the width only at points over a relatively small measure in @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding familiar 3 + 1 expression , on the other hand , is proportional to @xmath85 and thus vanishes at threshold .    of much greater numerical relevance in any number of dimensions",
    "are the breit - wigner lineshapes produced by resonant intermediate states . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ diags ] , such resonances enhance the width by a full factor of @xmath42 for the a but not the t diagram , and therefore were not an issue in ref .",
    "since explicit factors of @xmath0 no longer appear simply as a single overall coefficient in the width , one must choose a particular value for @xmath0 in order to obtain numerical results .",
    "quark - hadron duality should then be studied by taking @xmath0 as large as numerically feasible ; we return to a discussion of this point in sec .",
    "the computation of the inclusive width for the decay of a heavy - light meson via the annihilation diagram at the born level is fairly straightforward , and may be accomplished through two complementary approaches , each of which has its own advantages .",
    "the quark hamiltonian used for this calculation is given by @xmath86 \\left [ \\bar q_5 \\gamma^\\nu \\left ( c_v + c_a \\gamma_5 \\right ) q_2 \\right ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the tensor structure of the weak interaction propagator with momentum transfer @xmath51 .",

    "the partonic calculation of the width must incorporate the annihilation of the initial meson as well as the production of final - state free quarks . rather than decomposing the initial meson into a quark - antiquark pair free but correlated in such a way as to guarantee the desired total quantum numbers , we include the full meson coupling through @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 is the decay constant of meson @xmath23 . in the t  hooft model @xmath98",

    "this follows trivially from the observation that in the @xmath104 chiral limit both vector and axial - vector currents ( of light quarks ) are conserved . since for large @xmath0 the a amplitude factorizes , one must contract the vector index in eq .",

    "contraction with @xmath105 corresponds to taking the divergence of the currents , while contraction with @xmath106 corresponds to first exchanging the role of vector and axial - vector currents , and then taking the divergence .",
    "incidentally , this argument also applies in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "since the decay constant @xmath107 scales as @xmath108@xcite and @xmath109 as @xmath21 , the asymptotic @xmath19 behavior of the annihilation diagram width @xmath110 is @xmath111 .",

    "the ideal , of course , is to choose @xmath0 as large as possible in order to approach the results of the exact t  hooft model .",
    "however , such a choice makes the breit - wigners taller , narrower , and thus harder to average over @xmath19 , so that obtaining a smooth result for comparison with the one computed perturbatively is more difficult .",
    "in particular , one is forced to choose the range @xmath189 over which the averaging function has support to be larger and larger in order to obtain at last a smooth result for  @xmath190 .",
    "the averaging , or `` smearing , '' of @xmath191 in the heavy quark mass @xmath19 is carried out here by multiplying @xmath178 at a series of points @xmath192 over the range of @xmath19 by a suitably chosen smearing function , and then normalizing by the area under this function . in practice",

    "it should be pointed out that this smearing produces a small spurious result at the edges of the fitting range if the function to be smeared has a nonzero derivative ( apart from noise in the function ) at these points .",
    "for example , suppose one smears a linearly decreasing function near its endpoint .",
    "the smearing function of course samples only points to the left of the endpoint , where the function is uniformly larger than it is at the endpoint itself , and so the smeared result is slightly higher than expected .",
