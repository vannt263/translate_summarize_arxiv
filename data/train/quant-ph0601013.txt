    "formulated in this general way the problem has no obvious solution : positivity and normalisation conditions can derived by expressing the eigenvalues in terms of the expansion coefficients , i.e. finding the zeroes of the characteristic polynomial as functions of these parameters . as we know from abel and",

    "this particular choice of basis allows us to arrange the @xmath21 real coordinates of a m - qubit state in multidimensional arrays which are shown to transform as @xmath1 tensors .",
    "this fact implies that the probability spectrum of a m - qubit state depends only on @xmath1-invariants , a considerable simplification of the parameter dependencies of these eigenvalues , indeed .",
    "this simplification leads to a complete characterisation of complete@xmath22 sets of states which allow for an explicit construction of a parameter domain . in this way",
