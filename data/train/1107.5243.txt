    "_ proton paramagnetism _ : as in the case of neutrons , it comes from the interaction of the magnetic field with the proton magnetic dipole moment . however , the gyromagnetic factor for protons is positive ( @xmath84 ) , which favors configurations where the proton spin is parallel to the magnetic field .    _",
    "proton orbital magnetism _ : or landau - type magnetic response , that couples the orbital motion of protons with the magnetic field .",

    "the orbital magnetism associated with proton ballistic dynamics removes kramer s degeneracy in angular momentum projection @xmath68 of proton levels , and brings those aligned with the magnetic field down in energy . on the other hand , the paramagnetic response ( pauli magnetism ) removes the angular momentum projection degeneracy for both protons and neutrons .",

    "[ f:01 ] shows the evolution of the bulk properties of @xmath83o with increasing magnetic field . at first the influence of the external magnetic field",
    "is counteracted by the currents generated by the breaking of time reversal symmetry , including the classical @xmath86 contribution coming from the orbital coupling .",
    "the radius of the nucleus and spherical shape show high resilience to the increase in the external magnetic field . for field strengths around @xmath87 g",
    ", there is an abrupt decrease in binding energy , associated with increased radius and the sudden appearance of oblate deformation for the ground state .",
    "such discontinuities are an indication that the underlying shell structure has changed in a fundamental way . these jumps in bulk nuclear properties can be traced to the single - particle behavior , as can be observed in figs .",
    "[ f:02 ] and [ f:03 ] ; they occur when the last occupied level crosses the first empty level . at that point , for even - even nuclei",
    ", a reoccupation occurs .",
    "a particle is removed from a level going upwards with increasing b - field and brought to a level going downward with increasing spin .",
    "since these two levels have opposite angular momentum along the symmetry axis , the nucleus becomes spin - polarized .",
    "another effect on the structure of nuclei which are superfluid for vanishing external magnetic field is the gradual disappearance of the neutron and proton pairing - gaps with increasing external field .",
    "the original shell structure is washed out due to the complicated pattern of level crossings , and , as the magnetic field increases , new magic numbers may appear .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ f:01 ] we show two types of calculations .",
    "the full curve correspond to self - consistent calculations , where the nuclear potentials change with increasing external fields due to polarization of the densities and due to the polarization currents ( nuclear magnetism ) .",
    "the dashed curve ( frozen potentials ) correspond to a calculation where , in a first step , the nuclear potentials @xmath88 and @xmath89 are calculated without external magnetic field and subsequently these potentials are kept frozen while the external magnetic field is switched on .",
    "therefore , in this case we have no nuclear magnetism . for small external fields ,",
    "i.e. up to the first level crossing at @xmath90 g there is practically no difference .",
    "levels with @xmath91 are equally occupied and the corresponding single particle wave functions are very similar ; their contributions to the currents nearly cancel each other and there is practically no polarization and no nuclear magnetism",
    ". the situation changes , however , after the first level crossing .",
    "now the nucleus is spin polarized in the self - consistent solutions ( full curve ) , we have polarization currents and nuclear magnetism , effects neglected in the calculations with frozen fields .",
    "thus we observe differences in the binding energies and also in the location of the next level crossings .    in order to understand the results of fig .",
    "[ f:01 ] in more detail we consider in the figs .",
    "[ f:02 ] and  [ f:03 ] the effects on the single - particle structure outlined at the beginning of this section for frozen fields and for self - consistent fields .",
    "proton and neutron level degeneracy is broken in reversed directions due to the different sign in their paramagnetic behavior interacting with the external magnetic field .",
    "this degeneracy breaking is more acute in the case of protons , where the orbital magnetism plays an important role .",
    "therefore the first level crossing occurs for the protons at @xmath92 g. for frozen fields ( fig .",
    "[ f:02 ] ) this first level crossing for protons has no influence on the other proton levels nor on the neutron levels .",
    "this is no longer the case for the self - consistent solution in fig .",
    "[ f:03 ] , where the changes in the nuclear fields caused by polarization are clearly seen also in the other proton levels and due to the proton - neutron interaction also in the neutron levels .",
    "polarization effects induced by the @xmath74 and @xmath75 currents due to breaking of time - reversal symmetry are important , and the frozen fields approximation breaks down for higher magnetic fields . in the first level crossing one proton is removed from the @xmath93 shell and brought to the downward sloping orbit of the @xmath94 shell , i.e. to a level with @xmath95 . in the second and third panels of fig .",
    "[ f:01 ] we see that the reoccupation corresponds to an increase of the proton radius and transition from a spherical shape to an oblate deformation .",
    "light stable nuclei , like @xmath83o in fig .",
    "[ f:01 ] , are very stiff in their response to the external magnetic field . in this particular case",
    "the change in binding energy is less than 100 kev per particle for field strengths less than @xmath96 g. the induced currents tend to counteract the effects of the magnetic field .",
    "the point at which the first level crossing occurs may be arbitrarily defined as the minimum field strength for which the nuclear structure is significantly altered .",
    "thus for @xmath83o that would be @xmath97 g , with a jump in binding energy per particle of around 400 kev . for less stable and/or heavier nuclei ,",
    "as will be studied in the next section , it is expected that this minimum field is reduced , due to , mainly , two effects : i ) increase in the level density around the fermi energy , and ii ) the increase in the proton orbital magnetic response due to the occupation of single - particle orbitals with higher angular momenta .",
    "in particular , this implies that the validity of a frozen - field treatment of the coupling to an external magnetic is highly dependent on the nucleus under consideration . in the next section",
    "it shall be investigated the response of heavier nuclei to the external magnetic field .",
    "the outer crust of neutron stars , below the neutron drip density , is believed to be composed by well separated nuclei positioned on a body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice in complete thermodynamical equilibrium .",

    "so far all previous studies ( see , for example , [ 3,27 - 31 ] ) on the influence of strong magnetic fields in the composition of the crust have concentrated on the electron part , and assumed that the nuclear binding energy @xmath99 is not affected .",
    "this is certainly true for weaker magnetic fields are below @xmath104 g , since such fields do not alter the nuclear structure .",
    "however , previous studies @xcite where the influence of the magnetic field on the shell correction energy has been investigated in a simple model , found that fields with a strength above that threshold might change the nuclear binding energy , and thus modify the equilibrium nuclear species on the lattice .",
    "in fact , changes of a few kev per nucleon might significantly alter the composition , making more neutron - rich nuclei dominate over the most likely to be found nuclei around the @xmath6fe region @xcite .",
    "one important question is the location of this magnetic field strength threshold , in particular for nuclei in the vicinity of @xmath6fe .",

    "similar diagrams are found for all of the other nuclei presented in fig .",
    "[ f:05 ] , and in those in the vicinity of @xmath6fe . or",

    "concerning the possible changes in the hierarchy of binding energy per particle with increasing magnetic field , it has been found in this work that several nuclei ( e.g.  @xmath108fe and @xmath109fe ) overbind @xmath6fe for extended ranges of external magnetic field strengths . in that regard ,",
    "the frozen field solutions show a different behavior than the self - consistent ones",
    ". the field ranges for which this hierarchy changes occur are different and the magnitude is typically off by a couple hundred kev as compared with the fully self - consistent solutions .",
    "this ordering according to binding energy is one of the factors that influences the final composition of the outer crust in neutron stars , and quantitative predictions should be done using the full self - consistent formulation .",

    "it is the advantage of covariant theories that the these currents can be taken into account without any additional parameters . the minimum magnetic field that changes the nature of the nuclear ground - state is very much dependent on the nucleus , and its effects on the nuclear binding energy per nucleon range from a few tenths of kev for @xmath112 g to a few hundreds of kev for the maximum field theoretically possible @xmath3 g.    no neutron star has yet been observed with such intense magnetic fields @xmath113 g , even though theoretical models hint that such objects exist @xcite .",

    "the relevance of this change in composition depends on the abundance of normal neutron stars compared with that of magnetars . until now , observations suggest that magnetars are not so common in the universe and thus it is unlikely that the magnetic field effects on nuclear structure play an important role in global astrophysical observables like element abundances",
