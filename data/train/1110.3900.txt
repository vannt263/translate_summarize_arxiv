    ", we can also address the case of hamilton - jacobi equations with diffusion .",
    "the proof is slightly longer because we can not use the formula of lax and oleinik and instead we need to construct explicit super and subsolutions .    in order to handle a large class of diffusions ,",

    "the regularization effect is a consequence of the growth of @xmath2 respect to @xmath4 only .",

    "hlder regularity of hamilton - jacobi equation with a large growth with respect to the gradient variable has been addressed in several papers : in @xcite , @xcite it is proved that subsolutions of stationary equations are hlder continuous ( even up to the boundary of the domain ) as soon as the hamiltonian is superquadratic .",
    "the hlder regularity of solutions of as in theorem [ t : intro1 ] or [ t : intro2 ] has already been obtained in @xcite .",
    "this paper , based on techniques first introduced in @xcite , @xcite , relies on ( rather heavy ) stochastic control representation for solutions of combined with reverse hlder inequalities . on the contrary ,",
    "the new proof we present here uses only comparison principle with explicit functions that we can construct .",
    "there is no component of probability in the proof .    for hamilton - jacobi equations with second order diffusion ,",
    "if the growth with respect to the gradient variable is at most quadratic , then the second order diffusion dominates in small scales . for uniformly parabolic equations in non divergence form , the solutions are hlder continuous",
    "in fact , by a simple exponential change of variables ( first observed in @xcite for elliptic equations ) , this statement is a simple consequence of the hlder estimates from krylov and safonov for parabolic equations without gradient terms .",
    "hamilton - jacobi equations with fractional diffusions have also been studied in @xcite and @xcite in the case where the diffusion is stronger than the effect of the gradient on the hamiltonian .",
    "our assumption @xmath25 in theorems [ t : intro2 ] and [ t : intro3 ] explores the complementary condition in which the second order diffusion is weaker than the gradient terms at small scales . in our results",
    ", we treat the diffusion as a perturbation of the equation that plays no role in the regularization of the solutions .",
    "the case @xmath38 with degenerate diffusion is unclear , and we do not know if the solutions would become regular in that case .    the proofs we present in this article are based on the iteration at all scales of an improvement of oscillation lemma .",
    "this lemma says that the oscillation of a solution @xmath6 in a cylinder is smaller by a fixed factor than the oscillation in a larger cylinder ( also comparable by a fixed factor ) .",
    "the proof of this oscillation lemma has the interesting feature that it uses the fact that the hamilton - jacobi equation _ sees points _",
    "( i.e. points have positive capacity , i.e. controlled processes can be forced to hit a given point ) .",
    "the idea is that if @xmath6 is small at one single point on the bottom of a parabolic cylinder , then the equation forces @xmath6 to be small everywhere inside the cylinder . in the opposite case ,",
    "if @xmath6 is large at every point at the bottom of the cylinder , then naturally @xmath6 will be large everywhere inside .",
    "both implications are proved comparing @xmath6 with explicit super and subsolutions .",
    "the organization of the paper is the following .",
    "after this introduction , we have a small preliminary section where we analyze the scaling of the equation and we outline a general iterative improvement of oscillation scheme to prove hlder continuity .",
    "then we have three sections where we prove theorems [ t : intro1 ] , [ t : intro2 ] and [ t : intro3 ] respectively . even though there is a significant overlap between these results , we kept the three sections independent except for one lemma used to prove theorem [ t : intro2 ] that is also used in the proof of theorem [ t : intro3 ] .",
    "a reader interested in theorem [ t : intro1 ] only , needs to read sections [ s : prelim ] and [ sec : order1 ] only ( which is simple and very short ) . a reader interested in theorem [ t : intro2 ] ,",

    "we start this section we exploring the effect of several different scalings of the equation .",
    "let @xmath6 be a sub or super solution to @xmath39 then the function @xmath40 is a sub(super ) solution of the equation @xmath41    in order to prove a @xmath42 estimate , we need scalings that preserve the constant @xmath13 in front of the @xmath43 and diminishes the effect of diffusion and zero order term .    a first choice to consider is @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath46 , this scaling corresponds to zooming without altering the values of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 scaling ) .",
    "if @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( as needed for theorem [ t : intro1 ] ) , the scaling preserves the equation and we do not need to check anything else .",

    "thus we would need @xmath25 , so that @xmath52 when @xmath46",
    ". this will be the case in the proof of theorem [ t : intro2 ] .",

    "one of the most common methods to prove an interior hlder regularity result is by proving an improvement of oscillation lemma that is iterated at all scales .",
    "the improvement of oscillation lemma says that the oscillation of a solution to a given equation in a parabolic cylinder decreases by a fixed factor ( less than one ) when the size of cylinder is reduced by another given factor .",
