    "although different gauges are formally equivalent , some are simpler than others , or may have attractive properties .",
    "covariant gauges are well adapted to perturbative expansion and renormalization .",
    "however in qcd we are interested in confinement and eventually in bound - state problems which are inherently non - perturbative . for such puposes , non - covariant gauges such as the coulomb gauge , the weyl gauge , the axial gauge or the light - front gauge may be attractive .",
    "these gauges are considered `` physical '' in the sense that the space of states is believed to be unitary and does not involve ghosts .",
    "( for a discussion of various gauges see @xcite . )",
    "indeed non - covariant gauges such as the coulomb gauge and the light - front gauge have recently been used to investigate confinement in qcd @xcite .",
    "however it is a fact that at the level of quantum field theory , the well established , renormalizable gauges for qcd are , on the one hand , covariant , and on the other , involve `` unphysical '' particles .",
    "these are the fermi - ghosts that are needed to cancel the unphysical gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "one would like to know whether or not the physical gauges really exist in the sense of perturbatively renormalizable quantum field theories , and whether they are really unitary in the sense that they may be expressed without ghosts , in terms of the two transverse degrees of freedom of the gluon .",
    "we shall see that for the coulomb gauge , the answer to the first question is `` yes '' and to the second , a slightly qualified `` no '' .",
    "the point of view which we adopt in the present article is that the brst formulation provides a reliable method of quantizing and perturbatively renormalizing non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "( for a review see @xcite and . ) the existence and properties of physical or canonical gauges will be investigated deductively starting from the brst formulation . to be sure ,",
    "this inverts the historical order in which gauge theories were first canonically quantized , and subsequently the brst method was found ; however the canonical method has remained heuristic , and to this day does not allow systematic renormalization .",
    "there are two different problems raised by the commonly used `` physical gauges '' : ( i ) the breaking of lorentz covariance and ( ii ) an arbitrariness due to incomplete gauge fixing .",
    "for example the coulomb gauge condition @xmath1 obviously breaks lorentz invariance .",
    "it is also an incomplete gauge - fixing in the sense that it leaves a one - parameter family of gauge transformations arbitrary , namely gauge transformations @xmath2 that are independent of the spatial coordinate @xmath3 , but may depend on the time @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , the weyl gauge condition @xmath5 leaves arbitrary a 3-parameter family of gauge transformations , @xmath6 .",
    "we call the dimension @xmath7 of this parameter space the `` degree of arbitrariness '' of the gauge , and we have @xmath8 for the coulomb gauge , and @xmath9 for the weyl , the axial , and the light - front gauges .",
    "not surprisingly , the degree of arbitrariness of the gauge determines the dimension of the divergences of feynman integrals that are not controlled by usual ultraviolet regularization .    strictly speaking , incomplete gauge fixing with @xmath10 implies that the correlation functions of charged fields actually vanish at generic space - time separation .",
    "for example in the coulomb gauge , the arbitrariness under @xmath2 implies that the correlation function of two charged fields vanishes at unequal times , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , even in abelian gauge theory .",
    "this vanishing of correlation functions due to gauge arbitrariness is not what one has in mind by a ` physical ' gauge , and it is usually overcome in continuum gauge theory by additional gauge fixing by more or less explicit prescriptions .",
    "incomplete gauge fixing would appear to be the origin of ambiguities that occur in higher loop diagrams @xcite , and which make the formal coulomb gauge , defined by canonical quantization after elimination of the coulomb - gauge constraints , not particularly well - defined .",
    "consequently it is very misleading to speak of _ the _ coulomb gauge , as in the question , ` what are the feynman rules for _ the _ coulomb gauge ? ' . unless one is willing to accept the vanishing of correlation functions of charged fields at unequal times",
    ", this question can not have a unique answer without further stipulation of the gauge condition .",
    "this applies to all gauges with @xmath10 .",
    "we shall deal with both problems , lorentz breaking and gauge arbitrariness , by the device of an `` interpolating '' gauge .",
    "for example the gauge condition @xmath13 , with @xmath14 interpolates between the landau gauge , @xmath15 , and the coulomb gauge , @xmath16 .",
    "for @xmath17 the gauge condition is regular , in the sense that the degree of arbitrariness vanishes , @xmath18 , but lorentz invariance is broken for @xmath19 .",
    "this allows one to first address the problem of lorentz breaking in a regular gauge , and then to see if the singular limit @xmath20 yields finite correlation functions . in the present article we shall use and extended brst symmetry to control the violation of lorentz invariance , and we shall then study the coulomb gauge limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge .",
    "use of an interpolating gauge and an extension of brst symmetry to control the violation of lorentz invariance , was reviewed by piguet @xcite , particularly for the interpolating light - cone gauge .",
    "doust @xcite used a gauge which interpolates between the coulomb and feynman gauge to regularize the coulomb gauge , and showed that extra terms in the feynman rules which he obtained in the coulomb - gauge limit correspond to an additional potential term obtained by christ and lee from an operator ordering of their coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "difficulties with renormalization in the coulomb gauge were exhibited by doust and taylor .",
    "the weyl gauge ( @xmath5 ) has been studied by rossi and testa , and by cheng and tsai .    as commonly used in non - abelian gauge theories ,",
    "brst - invariance provides a substitute for invariance under local gauge transformations which is broken by the gauge - fixing term . in lorentz - covariant gauges ,",
    "one uses the brst method to enumerate the independent divergent counter - terms necessary to ensure finitness of the renormalized theory , while preserving all requirments of gauge invariance for physical quantities .",
    "it is a powerful algebraic method of great generality , relying as it does on the simplicity of invariance under a generator @xmath21 that is nil - potent @xmath22 .    in the first part of this article",
    ", we develop an extension of the brst method that also provides a substitute for invariance under global lorentz rotations when the gauge - fixing term breaks global lorentz invariance as well as local gauge invariance .",
    "the method is of considerable generality in that it does not rely on particular properties of the symmetry which is broken by the gauge - fixing term , but only that the symmetry operations form a lie group , and it allows us to explicitly enumerate all counter - terms .    for the class of interpolating gauges , defined by @xmath23 , with @xmath24 a non - singular",
    "matrix , the partition function is formally given by the faddeev - popov formula @xmath25",
    "\\det[(\\alpha\\partial)^\\mu d_\\mu(a ) ] \\exp [ - s_{ym } ] ,          \\label{eq : fp}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the euclidean yang - mills action .",
    "feynman graphs contain denominators of the form @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "as long as @xmath24 is non - singular , these denominators provide the same degree of convergence in all directions in @xmath29-space as the corresponding denominator @xmath28 in covariant gauges . consequently in this class of interpolating gauges ,",
    "power counting of graphs is exactly the same as in lorentz - covariant gauges .",
    "the problem of renormalizability is reduced to an algebraic one of enumerating the form of possible local divergent terms , which we control by extended brst - invariance . on the contrary , because of gauge arbitrariness in the limiting cases of the coulomb , light - cone or other singular gauges , the degree of convergence depends on the direction in k - space , and a more detailed analysis is required to determine if the limit is finite .    in the second part of the present article , we analyse the singular coulomb gauge limit , @xmath20 , from the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge .",
    "for this purpose we express the partition function @xmath30 as a functional integral in phase space , and then make a linear shift in the field variables in order to exhibit a symmetry ( @xmath31-symmetry ) between the fermi and bose unphysical degrees of freedom .",
    "individual closed fermi - ghost loops and closed unphysical bose loops diverge like @xmath32 , but they cancel pairwise by virtue of the @xmath31-symmetry .",
    "consequently the correlation functions are finite in the limit @xmath20 from the landau - coulomb gauge .",
    "this remains true for the renormalized correlation functions .",
    "( see remark 1 at the end of sect .",
    "however we also find that there are one - loop graphs that vanish like @xmath33 , and that are missing in the formal ( @xmath16 ) coulomb gauge , but which can not be neglected because they give a finite contribution when inserted into the graphs that diverge like @xmath32 .",
    "it remains a logical possibility that these two - loop graphs , that are missing in the formal coulomb gauge , are mere gauge artifacts that decouple from expectation values of all gauge - invariant quantities such as a wilson loop .",
    "however there is at the moment no argument to show that they do . indeed",
    "unless for some reason these two - loop graphs decouple from all physical amplitudes , then the ghosts do not decouple in the coulomb gauge limit , and the coulomb gauge is not unitary in the usual sense of being a canonical theory of the transverse gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "nevertheless we find that correlation functions of the coulomb - gauge limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge do exist , and moreover they display a kind of simplicity that is absent from covariant gauges .",
    "a certain gauss - brst ward identity holds in the coulomb gauge limit which implies , among other things , that the time - time componant of the gluon propagator @xmath34 is a renormalization - group invariant and thus depends only on a physical mass , @xmath35 , but not on the ultra - violet cut - off , @xmath36 , nor the renormalization mass , @xmath37 , which may make it a useful order parameter for color confinement .",
    "no component of the propagator has this property in a covariant gauge .",
    "in this section we introduce interpolating gauges for various familiar classical gauges .",
    "the landau and coulomb gauges are defined by @xmath38 and @xmath1 .",
    "the weyl and axial gauges are frequently defined by @xmath5 and @xmath39 respectively .",
    "however if periodic boundary conditions are introduced in time or space , the conditions @xmath5 and @xmath39 are too strong , and can not be maintained . for",
    "they fix to unity the values of straight - line wilson loops @xmath40 that close by periodicity , which however are gauge - invariant objects .",
    "we take instead as the weyl and axial gauge conditions the weaker conditions @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in momentum space these read @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so the weaker conditions differ from the stronger ones by zero modes only . similarly for the light - front gauge condition , instead of @xmath45 we take @xmath46 .    all these gauge conditions have the linear form @xmath47 , where in the various cases @xmath48 is the projector & p_^ & = _ ^= diag ( 1 , 1 , 1,1 )   + coulomb : & p_^ & = diag ( 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 )   + weyl : & p_^ & = diag ( 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 )   + axial : & p_^ & = diag ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 )   + light - front : & p_3 ^ 3 & = p_3 ^ 0 = p_0 ^ 3 = p_0 ^ 0 = 1/2  and   p_^= 0   otherwise .",

    "we have obtained the previous result , with the understanding that the cancellation of bose and fermi loops that diverge in the limit @xmath20 is preserved by the @xmath31-symmetry of @xmath401 .",
    "the @xmath31-symmetry which transforms @xmath78 into @xmath160 explains the equality of renormalization constants that holds in the limit @xmath20 , @xmath345 , which was established in the last section .",

    "however because , as we have seen , there are closed loops in the expansion of @xmath408 that are of order @xmath32 ( and that cancel pairwise ) , we must verify whether insertions into these loops of the vertices @xmath406 , @xmath407 or @xmath408 may give a finite result .",
    "these vertices are not @xmath31-invariant , so if there are such contributions there is no reason to expect that they cancel .",

    "the @xmath431-vertices are linear in @xmath53 .",
    "they also contain one time derivative , so in momentum space they contain one power of @xmath409 .",
    "thus overall when an @xmath431-vertex is inserted into a closed loop of scalar propagators it gives a contribution of order @xmath33 . as we have observed from @xmath410 , the volume element for a closed loop consisting of scalar propagators is of order @xmath32 .",
    "thus the presence of a single @xmath431-vertex in a closed loop of scalar propagators and @xmath31-vertices would give a finite limit , except for the fact that such a loop is odd in @xmath432 at large @xmath432 , and consequently a closed loop of scalar propagators with a single @xmath431-vertex is reduced to order @xmath33 . by the same reasoning , a closed loop of scalar propagators that contains two @xmath431-vertices ( and is thus even in @xmath432 ) is also of order @xmath33 .",
    "thus a single closed loop with one or two @xmath431-vertices vanishes like @xmath33 as @xmath20 .",
    "however a closed scalar loop with two @xmath431-vertices has two external scalar lines , because each x - vertex is trilinear in the scalar fields .",

    "we can not connect up two @xmath433-vertices by an additional scalar propagator because @xmath433-vertices are bilinear in the scalar fields .",

    "all the vertices are @xmath31-vertices except for one @xmath433-vertex at one end of the @xmath434 propagator .",
    "[ see fig .",
    "when the loop momentum @xmath332 is of order @xmath32 , the y - vertex is of order @xmath33 , the @xmath434 propagator is of order @xmath33 , and the volume element of the loop integral is of order @xmath32 , so overall this closed loop is of order @xmath33 .",
    "however it has two scalar external lines that emerge from the two ends of the @xmath436 propagator .",
    "consequently this closed loop , which is of order @xmath33 , may be inserted into in a scalar closed loop consisting of @xmath401 vertices which is of order @xmath32 .",

    "we summarize the results of this section : ( 1 ) the diagrams for which the @xmath332 integrations would diverge in the coulomb - gauge limit , @xmath20 , have been have been shown to cancel at finite @xmath53 .",

    "the correlation functions that do not involve the field @xmath51 are the same as in the configuration - space representation , so the finiteness of the unrenormalized correlation functions in the coulomb - gauge limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge also holds in each order @xmath236 for the configuration - space correlation functions .",
    "this implies that the configuration - space generating functionals @xmath30 , @xmath173 , @xmath203 and @xmath219 are also finite in the limit @xmath20 . here an ultraviolet dimensional regulator @xmath438 is understood to be in place . for the diagrams we have examined , the @xmath53-dependence at small @xmath53 is given by @xmath439 , where @xmath440 is a non - negative integer .",
    "( the terms with negative powers of @xmath33 cancel . ) these powers are @xmath438-independent , and so cause no trouble in the @xmath441 limit ( as would , for example , terms like @xmath442 ) . this is because the terms that diverge with @xmath53 come from divergences in the one - dimensional @xmath332 integrations and are not affected by dimensional regularization which is a continuation in the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "likewise the cancellation of terms that diverge as @xmath20 is assured by @xmath31-invariance , and is also dimension - independent .",
    "moreover @xmath443 , eq .  ( [ eq : solution ] ) , has a simple pole structure in @xmath438 .",
    "consequently the finiteness of @xmath444 as @xmath20 implies that the residue of @xmath443 and @xmath445 are separately finite as @xmath20 .",
    "although we have not made an exhaustive examination of all diagrams , we expect that the remaining diagrams behave similarly , and thus that the renormalized correlation functions are finite in the coulomb - gauge limit of the interpolating landau - coulomb gauge .",
    "we may regard the finite value of the 2-loop scalar graphs that are missing in the formal coulomb gauge , @xmath16 , as an anomaly of the @xmath31-symmetry ; for the action @xmath446 is @xmath31-invariant at @xmath16 , @xmath447 , but not at finite @xmath53 , and the symmetry is not regained in the limit @xmath20 .",

    "however the only non - zero propagator of the @xmath380 field is the @xmath455 propagator , and the vertex where @xmath78 is absorbed is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "a typical graph representing the contribution of @xmath454 to the fourier transform @xmath456 is illustrated in fig 4 .",
    "( note that @xmath330 is a color scalar , so it must decay into at least two quanta , namely @xmath160 and @xmath457 in fig .",

    "we rescale the variable of integration @xmath410 , and obtain a contribution of leading order @xmath33 , keeping in mind that terms that are asymptotically odd in @xmath432 are suppressed by @xmath33 .",
    "the other terms are evaluated similarly .",
    "one finds that each term of @xmath330 gives a contribution to the expectation - value of order @xmath33 .",
    "we we have seen that a closed loop of unphysical particles , with propagators @xmath458 , is of order @xmath32 as the coulomb - gauge limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge is approached .",
    "this behavior came from the rescaling , @xmath459 , that makes the loop integral of order @xmath410 . however in the light - front or axial gauge , the unphysical propagator is @xmath460^{-1}$ ] or @xmath461^{-1}$ ] , and the required rescaling , @xmath462 or @xmath463 , gives an uphysical closed loop integral of order @xmath464 or @xmath465 .",
    "thus the light - cone and axial gauge limits appear to be more singular than the coulomb - gauge limit , and additional cancellations would be required to give finite correlation functions .",
    "we briefly review our results .",
    "we have addressed the problem of the existence of `` physical gauges '' , by the device of interpolating gauges which interpolate linearly between a covariant gauge , such as the feynman or landau gauge and a physical gauge such as the coulomb or light - cone gauge .",
    "for example , the interpolating landau - coulomb interpolating gauge is defined by the gauge condition @xmath466 , which gives the landau gauge for @xmath54 , and the coulomb gauge is achieved in the singular limit @xmath20 .",
    "more generally an interpolating gauge is defined by the condition @xmath467 ( or @xmath314 ) , where @xmath24 is a non - singular numerical matrix , and a `` physical '' gauge is a limiting case in which @xmath24 becomes singular .    in general the interpolating gauge breaks",
    "lorentz invariance as well as local gauge invariance .",
    "nevertheless we are able to establish the existence of the perturbative expansion and perturbative renormalizability of the interpolating gauges in full generality , by extending the brst method to include the lorentz group in addition to the usual local gauge group .",
    "this extension is necessary to control the form of divergences , for example to show that the divergent coefficients of the term @xmath468 are equal , @xmath268 .",
    "the enumeration of the possible divergence terms that are brst - invariant is not substantially more difficult than for lorentz - covariant gauges .",
    "moreover the matrix @xmath24 is a gauge - parameter in the sense that the expectation values of physical observables are independent of @xmath24 , as long as @xmath24 is non - singular .",
    "thus the interpolating gauges are strictly equivalent to the covariant gauges .",
    "however the singular limit to a physical gauge is quite subtle .",
    "it is analyzed in the present article for the coulomb gauge limit , @xmath20 , from the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge .",
    "there are closed bose and fermi - ghost loops that become instantaneous in the limit @xmath20 and that individually diverge like @xmath32 .",
    "we we use a phase space representation and a linear shift of field variables to exhibit the cancellation of loops that diverge like @xmath32 , and to show by power counting of the @xmath332 integrals that this limit gives finite correlation functions .",
    "an important aspect of this limit is that there are also closed bose and fermi one - loop graphs that are not present in the formal coulomb gauge ( @xmath469 ) .",
    "although they vanish like @xmath33 , they can not be neglected because , when these one - loop graphs are inserted into the above - mentioned closed loops that diverge like @xmath32 , they give a finite contribution . consequently the closed bose and fermi - ghost loops do not decouple in the landau - coulomb gauge limit , but give a finite two - loop contribution .",
    "one logical possibility is that these two - loop ghost contributions are merely a gauge artifact that do not actually contribute to expectation - values of gauge - invariant objects such as wilson loops .",
    "however there is at present no argument in hand to show this .",
    "if these two - loop bose and fermi - ghost graphs do contribute to physical expectation values , then the traditional picture of the coulomb gauge would have to be revised .",
    "the state space would not be simply describable in terms of transverse gluons . in the latter case",
    "the coulomb gauge is not more unitary than other gauges , in the sense that it can not be simply described in terms of the classical dynamical variables that remain after the constraints are solved .",
    "indeed we are unable to provide a set of feynman rules to be used in the coulomb gauge at @xmath16 , although we have shown that both the unrenormalized and renormalized correlation functions are finite in the limit @xmath20 of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge .",
    "nevertheless there is a reward to be gained by taking this limit .",
    "for we have shown that the gauss - brst ward identity holds in the coulomb gauge limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge .",
    "this identity is the functional analog of the operator statement that the brst symmetry transformation is generated by the gauss - brst charge . among other things",
    ", it implies that @xmath0 is invariant under renormalization , @xmath470 .",
    "this means that all correlation functions of @xmath0 are renormalization - group invariants , including in particular the time - time component of the gluon propagator @xmath34 .",
    "it depends only on physical masses such as @xmath35 , but is independent of the cut - off or the renormalizaion mass .",
    "thus the coulomb - gauge limit of the landau - coulomb gauge provides direct access to renormalization - group invariant quantities , whereas no component of the gluon propagator has this property in covariant gauges . indeed in covariant gauges",
    "one must go to the wilson loop , which involves gluon correlation functions of all orders , to obtain a renormalization - group invariant quantity .",
    "for this reason the coulomb gauge may prove advantageous for non - perturbative formulations .",
    "in particular , the instantaneous part of @xmath34 may be a confining color - coulomb potential that may serve as an order parameter for confinement of color @xcite .",

    "<S> to study `` physical '' gauges such as the coulomb , light - cone , axial or temporal gauge , we consider `` interpolating '' gauges which interpolate linearly between a covariant gauge , such as the feynman or landau gauge , and a physical gauge . </S>",
    "<S> lorentz breaking by the gauge - fixing term of interpolating gauges is controlled by extending the brst method to include not only the local gauge group , but also the global lorentz group . </S>",
    "<S> we enumerate the possible divergences of interpolating gauges , and show that they are renormalizable , and we show that the expectation value of physical observables is the same as in a covariant gauge . in the second part of the article we study the coulomb - gauge as the singular limit of the landau - coulomb interpolating gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we find that unrenormalized and renormalized correlation functions are finite in this limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that there are finite two - loop diagrams of `` unphysical '' particles that are not present in formal canonical quantization in the coulomb gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we verify that in the same limit , the gauss - brst ward identity holds , which is the functional analog of the operator statement that a brst transformation is generated by the gauss - brst charge . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is invariant under renormalization , whereas in a covariant gauge , no component of the gluon field has this property .    </S>",
