    "observational evidence indicates that the near - polar accretion regions on the white dwarfs at least in some magnetic cvs ( mcvs ) are highly structured , displaying rapid fluctuations of the mass flux both in the spatial coordiates and in time .",
    "since information of their structure is lacking , a look at well - studied cases of magnetic accretion in the solar system may be inspiring : ( i ) jupiter s auroral oval displays substantial structure in its uv emission as observed with the hubble space telescope , and ( ii ) the earth s aurora shows narrow striations which extend along field lines and indicate different densities in adjacent flux tubes .",
    "although the physics is different , similar structures _ may _ exist in mcvs .",
    "present models of mcv accretion spots are not sufficiently sophisticated to account for such structure .",
    "they assume a spatially constant mass flux across the column and are respresentative rather of an individual subcolumn than of the accretion region as a whole .",
    "the radiative interaction between individual subcolumns represents a complication which is usually avoided .",
    "this neglect may be justified in the optically thin case , but represents a severe restriction if the column is optically thick . in this review",
    ", i will summarize the efforts made so far in understanding the properties of accretion columns with special emphasis on the solution of the coupled hydrodynamic and radiative transfer equations .",
    "figure 1a schematically shows the pole cap of the magnetic accreting white dwarf in a polar .",
    "the accretion column is fed by a mass flux @xmath0 ( cgs unit g@xmath1s@xmath2 ) with @xmath3 the density and @xmath4 the value of the frre - fall velocity @xmath5 at the shock front .",
    "the size of the accretion spot depends on the coupling processes in the l@xmath6-point and in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf , while the stand - off distance of the shock front , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the cooling time scale , depends on the emission process , i.e. on @xmath3 , the electron temperature @xmath9 , and the magnetic field strength @xmath10 .",
    "depending on the parameters , the emission region in mcvs is either tall ( as shown in fig .",
    "1 ) or pill - box shaped ( i.e. smaller than wide ) and the dominant emission process is either hard x - ray bremsstrahlung or ir / optical cyclotron emission . reprocessing in the atmosphere of the white dwarf produces , in addition , soft x - ray emission from the immediate surrounding of the impact region and uv emission from a wider irradiated area .    the fact that some polars are dominated by soft x - ray emission has been discussed in the literature for some 20 years and dubbed the `` soft x - ray problem '' . in the original model by lamb & masters ( 1979 ) and king & lasota ( 1979 ) , the white dwarf was assumed to intercept @xmath11% of the emission , i.e. the non - reflected fraction of the downward flux , and re - radiate it as soft x - rays .",
    "kuipers & pringle ( 1982 ) effectively solved the mystery of the intense soft x - ray emission by noting that dense blobs of matter would penetrate the photosphere and the subsequent optically thick radiative transfer would reprocess all emissions into quasi - blackbody soft x - rays ( see alo frank et al .",
    "1988 ) .    as an example , figure 1b displays the overall spectral energy distribution of the prototype polar am herculis at an orbital phase at which near - maximum cyclotron and x - ray emission is seen .",
    "the spectral energy distribution nicely displays the expected components : ( i ) cyclotron emission at infrared and optical wavelengths ; ( ii ) the heated polar cap of the irradiated white dwarf in the uv longward of the lyman edge ; ( iii ) an intense soft x - ray component ; and ( iv ) a hard x - ray bremsstrahlung ( + emission line ) component .",
    "the companion star and the unheated fraction of the white dwarf are comparatively faint light sources .",
    "all accretion - induced emissions fluctuate in time .",
    "e.g. , the soft x - ray flux of am herculis in its high state displays statistically relevant variations down to a time scale of @xmath12s , as shown by rosat pspc observations .",
    "this time scale corresponds to density fluctuations in the free - falling pre - shock accretion flow on length scales as short as @xmath13 cm .",
    "an earlier interpretation of the exosat soft x - ray light curve of am her ( hameury & king 1988 ) suggested already that many such intependent subcolumns are present at any time . for simplicity , most models disregard the inhomogeneities in the pre - shock flow in space and time .    for sufficiently high mass flux ,",
    "a standing shock separates the infalling matter from the shocked plasma which slowly cools and finally settles onto the white dwarf .",
    "an analytic solution for the structure of an optically thin postshock flow cooling by bremsstrahlung was given by aizu ( 1973 ) .",
    "if the flow is optically thick , which is always the case for cyclotron emission in the fundamental , the solution becomes much more complicated because the radiative transfer has to be treated simultaneously with the hydrodynamics ( woelk & beuermann 1996 ) .",
    "in a hydrodynamic shock , the ions are stopped by coulomb collisions and the shock thickness equals about one ion mean free path .",
    "a special situation arises if cooling is so strong that the randomized energy can be radiated by the electrons within that scale length , i.e. , effectively `` on the spot '' . in this case ,",
    "an _ extended _ post - shock cooling flow does not exist and the concept of a discontinuity separating two regimes of the flow is no longer appropriate .",
    "the whole flow has now collapsed to a width which corresponds to the shock thickness and effectively can be described as a hot corona forming part of the white dwarf atmosphere .",
    "this mode is referred to as the bombardment solution .",
    "the required efficient cooling for this case can be provided by cyclotron radiation in a strong magnetic field which causes the electron temperature to stay far below the rankine - hugoniot temperature @xmath14 of the shock solution . originally suggested by kuijpers & pringle ( 1982 ) , this case was rigorously solved by woelk & beuermann ( 1992 ) .",
    "they treated the ion collisional energy loss by means of statistical plasma physics and simultaneously accounted for the losses of the electrons by a fully frequency - dependent and angle - dependent radiative transfer in a plane - parallel heated atmosphere .",
    "the solution predicts a peak electron temperature which increases as k@xmath15 ( woelk & beuermann 1993 , see also fischer & beuermann 2001 ) and equals 1kev for @xmath16g@xmath1s@xmath2 , @xmath17 mg , and a white dwarf mass of 0.6m@xmath18 .",
    "such low temperatures are observed in am her stars with very low accretion rates ( schwope this conference ) and suggest that the predicted temperatures are roughly correct .",
    "the solution becomes invalid when @xmath9 approaches the rankine - hugoniot temperature with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath20g@xmath1s@xmath2 , the post - shock plasma flow and the radiative transfer have to be treated simultaneously .",
    "the only feasible approach is a fluid description which does not allow to resolve the shock front , however .",
    "there is no simple connection between such an approach and the kinetic description of the bombardment solution .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the fluid approach for low @xmath19 recovers some important apects of the bombardment case .",
    "the general case assumes a two - fluid plasma and allows for different temperatures @xmath21 and bulk velocities @xmath22 of ions and electrons . at the high densities in mcv shocks",
    ", coulomb collisions will assure @xmath23 , except perhaps within the ( unresolved ) shock front .",
    "a two - fluid treatment may then proceed with a single equation of motion which contains the total pressure , i.e. the sum of ion pressure @xmath24 and electron pressure @xmath25 .",
    "the skalar pressure and the temperature are related by @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 and @xmath28 the particle densities of ions and electrons ) , which assumes that the particle distributions are isotropic and maxwellian .",
    "cyclotron losses could , in fact , produce an anisotropic electron distribution function , but the optical depth in the fundamental harmonic is so large that radiative transfer causes the temperatures perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field to agree closely , except very near the surface of the emission volume ( zhelezniakov 1983 ) . for simplicity , we assume a hydrogen plasma in which @xmath29 and the mean molecular weight is @xmath30 .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations include the continuity equation , the equation of motion , and the energy equations for ions and electrons , which describe the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy , respectively : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34.\\ ] ] here , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the mass density with @xmath37 the unit mass ( @xmath38 proton mass ) , and @xmath39 is the adiabatic index . on the right hand sides ,",
    "the equation of motion contains the gravity @xmath40 and the volume force exerted by absorbed and scattered radiation , @xmath41 .",
    "the latter becomes important when the accretion rate approaches the eddington limit . in the energy equations",
    ", @xmath42 describes the energy exchange between ions and electrons by coulomb collisons and @xmath43 refers to electron heating by any other process , with the energy provided again by the ions .",
    "additional energy gains of the electrons are described by the divergence of the heat conduction flow @xmath44 and of the radiative flux @xmath45 .",
    "calculation of the radiative flux ( eq.5 ) requires solution of the radiative transfer equation ( 6 ) for the intensity @xmath46 as a function of the direction @xmath47 and the frequency @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the scattering and absorption coefficients , @xmath51 is the angle - averaged intensity and the use of @xmath52 for the source function indicates the assumption of lte : @xmath53 @xmath54 unsurprisingly , eqs.(1)(6 ) have not been solved in all their beauty , but only after the introduction of some rather severe simplifications .",
    "the correct funnel geometry ( see canalle , this conference ) is most complicated so solve , the spherical or the linear geometry represent the simpler cases of which the latter is an acceptable approximation only for shock heights @xmath55 .",
    "realistic columns are always limited in the direction perpendicular to the flow .",
    "this limitation is of no concern when the radiative losses can be treated as optically thin emission , but in the optically thick case it requires a multi - dimensional radiative transfer ( i.e. , with the _ direction _ of @xmath56 position - dependent ) .",
    "comparatively simple cases are ( i ) a shallow infinite layer with the radiative flux vector constantly pointing in the radial direction ( woelk & beuermann 1996 , fischer & beuermann 2001 ) or ( ii ) a tall column with the radiative flux vector pointing only sideways ( cropper et al .",
    "naturally , gravity effects increase with column height .      in eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) , the quantity @xmath43 represents any heating process other than coulomb collisions .",
    "non - coulomb heating of electrons is known to occur in interplanetary shock fronts , in particular , the bow shock of the earth ( e.g. stone & tsurutani 1985 ) . in these collisionless shocks ( with a typical particle density of @xmath57@xmath58 ) characteristic processes are the reflection of ions , charge separation between electrons and ions , and the incidence of various types of plasma instabilities which lead to rapid electron heating .",
    "plasma instabilities may also play a role in heating the electrons in supernova shocks ( lesch 1990 ) .",
    "whether such processes occur in mcv shocks with @xmath59 , high mach numbers , and high particle densities ( exceeding those in interplanetary space by factors of @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) needs to be studied .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , saxton & wu 2001 ) assume the presence of plasma heating in the shock front and consider @xmath9 immediately behind the shock a free parameter , possibly ranging up to @xmath62 .",
    "others , like woelk & beuermann 1992 , 1996 ) and fischer & beuermann ( 2001 ) have disregarded plasma heating and considered coulomb collisions only ( @xmath63 ) . in their solutions , the ion temperature displays a ( quasi-)discontinuity at the shock , while the electron temperature increases only on a length scale which equals the coulomb time scale times the flow speed .",
    "clearly , the question of plasma heating in the shock front needs further consideration .",
    "electron and ion temperatures will be similar if the time scale for energy exchange between ions and electrons by coulomb collisions is short compared with the cooling time scale .",
    "a one - fluid plasma is a reasonable approximation for high @xmath19 and low @xmath10 , while a two - fluid approach is required for low @xmath19 and high @xmath10 .",
    "the dividing line between the two regimes is approximately located at @xmath64 , where @xmath19 is in g@xmath1s@xmath2  and @xmath65 is in units of @xmath66 g ( see fig.4 below ) . hence , @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "the free - free optical depth of the post - shock flow parallel to @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "hence , a flow cooling by bremsstrahlung only is optically thin to a first approximation with @xmath73erg@xmath58s@xmath2 . in this case , the divergence term is a locally defined quantity which obviates the need for solving the radiative transfer equation .",
    "most authors have simplified the radiative transfer by replacing @xmath74 by a generalized cooling function expressed as the sum of terms of the form @xmath75 with @xmath76 fixed for each term .",
    "bremsstrahlung is represented by @xmath77 , cyclotron radiation by @xmath78 ( saxton & wu 2001 , and references therein ) .",
    "the concept of a cooling function is applicable in approximately the same limit as the one - fluid plasma , @xmath68 ( see fig.4 below ) .",
    "this limitation applies to radiative transfer through the shock front . for tall columns",
    "which lose energy preferentially through their sides , cooling functions are applicable also for lower values of @xmath79      the heat conduction flow , @xmath80 , is of importance only in regions of high particle density , high electron temperature , and/or a large gradient of the latter , i.e. ( i ) in the transition between the cooling flow and the stellar atmosphere and ( ii ) in the shock front with the adjoining pre - shock flow ( imamura et al .",
    "most attempts to solve eqs.(1)(6 ) proceed with @xmath81 .",
    "wu ( 2000 ) has summarized the effects of heat conduction in mcvs .",
    "the post - shock region is optically thick for the stronger atomic emission lines , complicating their calculation .",
    "one may adapt a procedure known from stellar atmosphere research which involves two steps : ( i ) the temperature structure is calculated assuming continuum absorption and emission only ; ( ii ) the emerging emission line fluxes are calculated using this temperature structure .",
    "tennant et al . ( 1998 ) and wu et al . (",
    "2001 ) have used a cooling function for step ( i ) and a simplified line transfer for step ( ii ) .",
    "an accurate calculation of the line profiles and line intensities requires substantial effort .",
    "time - dependent solutions of the hydrodynamic equations can be used to study the stability of stationary solutions .",
    "the added complication of the time dependence is compensated for by the simplicity of the coolong function .",
    "the stability analysis proceeds by , e.g. , ( i ) assuming small perturbations of the position of the shock front and of the plasma parameters , ( ii ) linearization , and ( iii ) analysis of the growth rates of the harmonics of the oscillations ( langer et al .",
    "1982 , saxton & wu 2001 , wu 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the possible frequencies are the equivalent to the harmonic oscillations of a pipe which is open at one end .",
    "saxton & wu ( 2001 ) confirm earlier findings that shocks cooling by bremsstrahlung only are unstable against oscillations , except possibly in the fundamental mode .",
    "shocks dominated by cyclotron cooling , on the other hand , are stable in the fundamental and all reasonably occurring higher oscillation modes .",
    "this suggests that stationarity is a reasonable model assumption if cyclotron emission is the dominant cooling agent .",
    "the low - amplitude oscillations with periods of @xmath82s seen in several mcvs ( e.g. larsson 1982 ) probably originate from regions within the accretion spot which are dominated by bremsstrahlung .",
    "solutions of eqs.(1)(6 ) with a time - dependent mass flux @xmath19 incident on the white dwarf do not exist to my knowledge .",
    "with @xmath83 ( or a sum of such terms ) , only the hydrodynamic equations have to be solved . in the stationary case for linear or spherical geometry , eqs .",
    "( 1)(4 ) reduce to a system of coupled ordinary ( though non - linear ) equations , in which all plasma parameters depend only on the radial coordiate .      for a one - fluid plasma , @xmath84 and eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 )",
    "may be combined to a single energy equation .",
    "the linear case is simplest and applies if the shock height is @xmath85 . with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90const , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations reduce to @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath95 for the above cooling function @xmath96 , a closed - integral solution has been given wu et al .",
    "because of the one - fluid assumption , the solution is limited to the high @xmath97 , low @xmath10 part of the @xmath19@xmath10 plane . in the spherical case , the mass flux @xmath98 in eq.(7 ) and",
    "@xmath99 in eq.(8 ) are @xmath100-dependent .",
    "the linear and spherical cases can be solved analytically if cooling is by bremsstrahlung only ( aizu 1973 ) .",
    "a potentially important case is that of a narrow , tall column ( width @xmath101 height @xmath102 ) which emits cyclotron radiation primarily sideways ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "the radiative flux vector is then approximately in the @xmath104-plane which effectively decouples hydrodynamics and radiative transfer . with certain simplifying assumptions on the transverse radiative transfer",
    ", the radiative losses can be approximated by a cooling function ( wu et al .",
    "1994 , cropper et al .",
    "1999 ) .      for strong cyclotron cooling ( @xmath70 )",
    ", the one - fluid approximation becomes invalid .",
    "electron and ion temperatures differ , and eq.(9 ) has to be replaced by @xmath105 @xmath106 although the temperatures deduced this way will be more reliable , the question of electron heating in the shock ( @xmath43 ) implies a remaining uncertainty .",
    "temperature profiles of ions and electrons with different assumptions on @xmath43 ( and @xmath3 ) are depicted , e.g. , in saxton & wu ( 2001 , their fig .",
    "3 ) . for strong heating ,",
    "the profiles are characterized by a maximum at the shock and a rapid decrease thereafter , while weak shock heating causes the electron temperature to assume a maximum further downstream , approaching the case of pure coulomb heating .",
    "the only truely radiation - hydrodynamic solution is that of woelk & beuermann ( 1996 ) .",
    "fischer & beuermann ( 2001 ) present further results including a parametrization of the temperature profiles .",
    "their approach involves the solution of the four hydrodynamic equations , eqs .",
    "( 7 ) , ( 8) , ( 10 ) , and ( 4 ) with @xmath87 and @xmath107 @xmath108 simultaneous with the radiative transfer equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) . the solution of the latter was developed from a feautrier code for plane - parallel stellar atmospheres , modified to include the anisotropy of cyclotron absorption and emission .",
    "the radiative transfer is fully frequency and angle dependent .",
    "the solution is energy conserving and ensures that the radiative flux ( eq.6 ) exactly equals the accretion energy @xmath109 .",
    "however , because of the plane - parallel ansatz the radiative flux is directed radially . in his review , wu ( 2000 )",
    "incorrectly states that the diffusion approximation was used and that energy is not conserved .",
    "the solution relates @xmath9 in a unique way to @xmath19 , @xmath10 , and @xmath110 as the physical input parameters .",
    "2 shows examples of the profiles of @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 for @xmath114 mg and @xmath115 and 1.0g@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "electron and ion temperatures are found to differ substantially near the shock front and equilibrate only further downstream .",
    "all flows are optically thick in the cyclotron fundamental which requires a negative electron temperature gradient to allow the energy to escape through the shock front .",
    "this is a consequence of the assumption of an _ infinite _ layer and may no longer hold true for columns of finite width . the effect of plama instabilities heating the electrons in the shock has not so far been considered by us and one can only speculate as to the effect they may have in the presence of optically thick radiative transfer . if the radiation escapes through the shock front , radiative transfer is likely to counteract plasma heating and will tend to depress @xmath9 .",
    "i consider it unlikely that @xmath9 at the shock can be anything near the rankine - hugoniot temperature for high @xmath10 and low @xmath19 .",
    "the low temperatures of @xmath116kev observed from some am her stars ( e.g. schwope , this conference ) seem to support this conclusion , but it is fair to state that the importance of plasma instabilities in mcv shocks is far from understood and further study is needed .    in fischer & beuermann ( 2001 )",
    ", we have parameterized the profiles @xmath111 by their peak value @xmath117 and the shock height @xmath118 .",
    "fig.3 shows @xmath117 normalized to the ion temperature at the shock which initially contains all the energy ( left panel ) and a normalized version of the shock height ( right panel ) .",
    "both representations unify the results for a large range of model parameters ( `` data '' points ) into a unique dependence on the quantity @xmath119 ( `` data '' points and solid curves for 0.6m@xmath18 , dotted curves for 1m@xmath18 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the decreasing peak electron temperature for low @xmath120 merges into the results for the bombardment solution ( straight lines ) . in the same limit",
    ", the normalized shock height @xmath121 ( in cm ) becomes constant . from fig.3 ( right panel )",
    "one finds a limiting shock height for the 0.6  white dwarf and for low @xmath122 of @xmath123 , i.e. @xmath66 cm for 30 mg and as low as @xmath124 cm for 100 mg . since bremsstrahlung - dominated shocks at the same @xmath10 but",
    "higher @xmath19 will be still lower , the assumption of plane - parallel or pillbox - shaped shocks is likely to be good for the higer field strengths .    in an attempt to generalize the results for a finite column width @xmath125 , we have calculated the additional energy losses by optically thick radiation leaving their sides using a ray tracing technique ( fischer & beuermann 2001 ) . for a given @xmath19 , these added losses cause the equilibrium temperature to be _ lower _ than in an _ infinite _ layer .",
    "a correct treatment of the problem would require a truly 2-d radiative transfer which presents a substantial complication and introduces the with @xmath125 as an additional model parameter besides @xmath97 .",
    "no such calculations are available in the literature .",
    "fischer & beuermann suggest a simple correction which ensures energy conservation : the electron temperature derived for @xmath126 for an infinite layer approximately applies to the higher value @xmath127 for finite @xmath125 , where @xmath128 is the ratio of the total radiative loss from the finite region over the accretion energy ( both per @xmath129 ) .",
    "they provide a calibration of @xmath100 as a function of @xmath130 and @xmath122 . finally , note that in _ all _ models which approximate the optically thick radiative transfer by an emergent planck spectrum cut off at some critical frequency @xmath131 energy is , by definition , only approximately preserved .",
    "the ram pressure @xmath132 of the infalling matter suppresses the bottom of the cooling flow into the atmosphere of the white dwarf .",
    "if also the shock front is located within the atmosphere , the shock is considered submerged or buried ( frank et al .",
    "fig.4 compares @xmath118 vs. @xmath19 ( from fig.3 , right panel ) to the depression produced by @xmath133 .",
    "one finds that bremsstrahlung - dominated shocks are buried for @xmath134g@xmath1 , while cyclotron - dominated shocks in high - field polars may be buried for much lower @xmath19 . to be sure ,",
    "the chance for the upward directed radiation to escape will depend on the details of the geometry .",
    "we have employed a heuristic model to estimate the effect of buried shocks on the emerging spectra .",
    "specifically , we use a field strength of @xmath135 mg ( appropriate for am herculis ) and consider radiation emerging at an angle against the radial direction of 60@xmath136 .",
    "we consider subcolumns with @xmath19 values ranging from @xmath137 to 100g@xmath1s@xmath2 , disregard the radiative interaction of the subsolumns , adopt a warm absorber which leaves soft x - rays largely unaffected , and approximately account for photoelectric absorption in the surrounding atmosphere using a ray tracing technique .",
    "radiation intercepted by the white dwarf atmosphere is assumed to be reprocessed into uv radiation and soft x - rays with a temperature at the base of the individual subcolumns and their surroundings , which depends on the energy flux incident on the white dwarf . for simplicity , we assume blackbodies for the reprocessed flux .",
    "this assumption may be acceptable for the hot sections of the atmosphere , but the cooler uv emitting parts of the heated pole cap would correctly show the lyman edge in absorption ( gnsicke et al .",
    "1998 , fig .",
    "12 ) . in fig.5 , the original emission and the reprocessed spectra",
    "are shown as dashed and solid curves , respectively .",
    "for low @xmath19 , the shock stands above the atmosphere and the emitted radiation escapes more or less freely , for larger @xmath19 the originally emitted radiation is increasingly absorbed and reprocessed into soft x - rays , until at @xmath138g@xmath1s@xmath2  the emission region is hidden behind an average column density of @xmath139g@xmath1  and is completely reprocessed .",
    "the characteristic shapes of the spectra in fig.5 depend on @xmath19 and @xmath10 . for",
    "a given field strength , such set of spectra can be used to synthesize the observed spectral energy distribution and thus yield the generating @xmath19-distribution .",
    "fig.6 shows the result for am herculis , based on the cyclotron and x - ray spectral energy distributions observed near the respective orbital maxima . the cyclotron flux ( priedhorsky et al .",
    "1978 ) is modelled by contributions with 100g@xmath1s@xmath2  ( curve a ) to @xmath140g@xmath1s@xmath2  ( curve f ) , with very small contributions for @xmath141g@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum , on the other hand , originates mostly from mass fluxes around 1  g@xmath1s@xmath2 , and the large soft x - ray flux is produced by @xmath142g@xmath1s@xmath2 .",
    "hence , the origin of the individual contributions is to a sufficient extent mutually exclusive .",
    "it is comforting and adds to the credibility of the result that the contributions for @xmath19 around 1  g@xmath1s@xmath2  derived from the cyclotron and x - ray fluxes are consistent with each other . the same analysis has been performed for the low state of am herculis , using the infrared cyclotron spectrum of bailey et al .",

    "is the result of a corresponding analysis of the low state .",
    "while the errors in the derived values of @xmath143 are much larger in the low state , a plausible picture emerges .",
    "the high state is characterized by a large contribution from high @xmath19 which are largely missing in the low state , while a drizzle of low @xmath19 seems to be present at all times ( including most low states observed so far ) .",
    "quite possibly , these differences exist already in the flow passing through the nozzle in l@xmath6 .",
    "note that `` 100g@xmath1s@xmath2 '' is actually a synonym for dense blobs since we are not able to distinguish between more or less dense blobs .",
    "the fate of blobs of different density is not considered here as long as the shocks are likely to be buried ( compare frank et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "it is long known that soft x - ray emission does not prevail in all am her stars , a notable exception being some systems with a low polar field strength ( beuermann & schwope 1994 , ramsay et al .",
    "1994 , ramsay this conference ) .",
    "one possible explanation is the shift of the whole @xmath19-distribution towards smaller @xmath19 , which is expected to occur in systems with lower field strengths .",
