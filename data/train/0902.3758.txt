    "the isoelectric focusing ( ief ) is a classical method of a mixture separation that is widely used in medicine and biology .",
    "there is an enormous number of publications devoted to its theory and applications .",
    "we mention here only fundamental papers @xcite , the monographs considering various theoretical and practical aspects of the ief @xcite , and papers @xcite that contain mathematical models and computer simulations that are close to the topic of our paper .",
    "there are also a number of papers that study the related problems in space biotechnology @xcite .",
    "an important part of the ief is the creation of stable ph - gradients that are used for the setting up of a focusing process .",
    "carrier ampholytes have been in a wide practical use for the creation of ph - gradients starting from pioneering papers @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . the use of immobilized ph - gradients for the same purpose has been proposed and introduced by @xcite , while the use of borate - polyol systems for the creation of ph - gradients is considered in @xcite .",
    "the mathematical models describing the formation of stable ph - gradients with the use of carrier ampholytes are given in @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite introduce the notion of mixtures with the infinite number of components ( the infinite - component mixtures ) where the authors formally replace the discrete number @xmath0 in the concentration @xmath1 onto the continuous parameter @xmath2 ; in other words the discrete set @xmath1 , @xmath3 is replaced by the distribution function @xmath4 .",
    "the first and simplest mathematical models describing the creation of linear ( or almost linear ) ph - gradients with the use of carrier ampholytes were given in @xcite .",
    "more advanced approaches that employ the governing differential equations of continuous media , mathematical modeling , and computations are given in @xcite .",
    "these papers show that an ampholyte concentration distribution should be close to gaussian s one and a ph - gradient should be linear .",
    "similar results with the use of models for infinite - component mixtures were obtained in @xcite .",
    "the statement that a concentration distribution possesses a gaussian shape is currently accepted as a key classical result .",
    "moreover , it is widely assumed that the increase of a potential difference ( or an electric current ) stabilizes a linear ph - gradient and intensifies a focusing process . on the contrary , the main results of our paper show that the increase of an electric current ( starting from some threshold value ) causes an anomalous steady stepwise ph - gradient and a piecewise - constant concentration distribution .",
    "in addition we present explicit analytical expressions for a ph distribution and for an electric conductivity as the functions of ampholyte concentrations .",
    "the obtained asymptotic expressions for the concentrations of ampholytes allow us to carry out the calculations of stepwise ph - gradients .",
    "well - known governing equations describing ief in the aqueous solution of ampholyts in dimensionless variables are @xcite : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 here @xmath11 are molar ampholyte concentrations , @xmath12 is a function , linearly connected to ph of a solution , @xmath13 is the strength of an electric field , @xmath14 are the densities of molar ampholyte fluxes , @xmath15 is the density of an electric current ( it can also depend on time @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is a hydrogen ion concentration , @xmath18 is a diffusion parameter , @xmath19 are characteristic mobilities of components in an electric field , @xmath20 are diffusion coefficients , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the molar charges and the molar conductivities of ampholytes , @xmath23 are the electrophoretic mobilities of ampholytes , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the mobilities of hydrogen @xmath26 and hydroxyl @xmath27 ions , @xmath28 is the effective mobility of water ions , @xmath29 is the autodissociation constant for water , @xmath30 is the value of @xmath31 when water conductivity is minimal .",
    "the system of equations ( [ vvz:1])([vvz:6 ] ) describes the mass transport under the action of an electric field in a chemically active medium .",
    "chemical reactions in the medium are assumed to be very fast ( being completed almost instantly ) .",
    "the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 are given ; in each particular case they can be defined from the chemical kinetic equations ( see below ) .",
    "the _ algebraic _ equation ( [ vvz:4 ] ) represents the condition of mixture electroneutrality ; it allows us to find @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , this equation describes the instant control of medium properties ( electrophoretic mobilities and molar conductivities ) by the function @xmath31 ( that is linked to the concentration of hydrogen ions ) .",
    "such situation is typical only for a weak aqueous solution ; in more general cases the values @xmath32 , @xmath33 can depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the term @xmath34 in ( [ vvz:3 ] ) describes the contribution of water ions into mixture conductivity , while the term @xmath35 in ( [ vvz:4 ] ) corresponds to the contribution of these ions into a mixture molar charge .",
    "these terms should be included into the governing equations if the autodissociation reaction is taken into account : @xmath36 in this case the concentrations of ions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are reflated as @xmath39 ,   \\quad   [ \\textrm{oh}^-]=\\frac{k^2_w}{[\\textrm{h}^+]}=\\frac{k^2_w}{h},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is an autodissociation constant for water , square brackets [  @xmath41  ] denote the values of concentrations , as it is accepted in chemistry .",
    "let us note that the maximal values of concentrations @xmath1 and the values @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath3 are all of the order @xmath44 , while the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath29 are small .",
    "notice , that we denote an autodissociation constant for water as @xmath45 , not @xmath29 ; hence @xmath29 represents a dissociation constant for water , its value in dimensional variables is @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , instead of a conventionally used function ph ( measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution ) we use function @xmath31 ( linearly connected with ph ) which is better adapted to our mathematical model ( see ( [ vvz:6 ] ) ) . , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 as well as the replacement of roman figures for numbers by arab digits initiated an extraordinary progress in sciences .",
    "]    in order to make the system ( [ vvz:1])([vvz:6 ] ) complete , we have to prescribe the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 for ampholytes .",
    "let us consider the solution of @xmath49 amphoteric substances ( ampholytes ) that exhibit both acid and based properties ( a typical representative is an amino acid ) .",
    "the dissociation reactions are ( @xmath50 ) @xcite : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is a zwitterion ( for instance an amino acid residue ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are dissociation constants for acid ( @xmath55 ) and based ( @xmath56 ) groups correspondingly .",
    "notice , that even for polyampholytes with supplementary side groups a reaction scheme can be described by ( [ vvz:7 ] ) , assuming the ph of a solution being close to the isoelectric point of a substance @xcite .",
    "the analytical concentrations @xmath57 , molar charges @xmath58 , and molar conductivities @xmath59 for ( [ vvz:7 ] ) are : @xmath60 + [ \\textrm{r}^0_i ] + [ \\textrm{r}^{-}_i],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 here @xmath43 is an isoelectric point ( the value of @xmath31 when the molar charge @xmath64 is zero , _ i.e. _ @xmath65 ) , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are auxiliary notations .",
    "notice , that it is convenient _ not to write _ explicit expressions for @xmath68 and @xmath69 but to present them as the derivatives of functions @xmath70 .",
    "let us take @xmath71 and introduce non - leak boundary conditions for the ampholytes at the walls of an electrophoretic chamber ( @xmath72 ) : @xmath73 the total molar concentration of each ampholyte is : @xmath74 the values @xmath28 , @xmath30 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath75 , @xmath3 , @xmath29 , @xmath18 are given .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider only the ief case with a given electric current density @xmath15 . the problem with a given constant voltage can be solved similarly",
    ", however it is more tedious .",
    "the integration of equations ( [ vvz:1 ] ) with boundary conditions ( [ vvz:9 ] ) yields @xmath76 that can be written as : @xmath77 the remaining equations keep their form : @xmath78 @xmath79 the system of equations ( [ vvz:11])([vvz:13 ] ) with additional conditions ( [ vvz:10 ] ) allow to find the concentrations @xmath80 , @xmath81 , the strengths of the electric field @xmath82 , and the function @xmath83 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath84 ) .",
    "let us emphasize here that despite of the presence of derivative @xmath85 we do not need to introduce any supplementary condition for @xmath31 , since the function @xmath31 has been determined by the algebraic equation ( [ vvz:13 ] ) .",
    "for the problem ( [ vvz:10])([vvz:13 ] ) we have found the change of dependent variables that allows us to obtain explicit analytical expressions for functions @xmath83 and @xmath82 .",
    "we introduce a new ` concentration ' @xmath86 and the ` effective ' strength of the electric field @xmath87 as : @xmath88 @xmath89 in this case one can easily show that @xmath83 and @xmath82 are defined by the explicit expressions , provided that functions @xmath86 are known : @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 in order to find @xmath86 ( taking into account the conditions ( [ vvz:10 ] ) and the changes of variables ( [ vvz:14 ] ) ) we have the following system of @xmath93 differential equations with @xmath31 and @xmath94 defined by ( [ vvz:15 ] ) and ( [ vvz:16 ] ) @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 with the boundary conditions : @xmath98 the additional variables @xmath99 have the meaning of the total number of moles of an ampholyte in the interval @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "the nonlinear boundary problem ( [ vvz:17])([vvz:19 ] ) can be solved numerically with the use of a shooting method , by the reduction of ( [ vvz:17])([vvz:19 ] ) to cauchy s problem with unknown initial data @xmath102 . to find @xmath102",
    "one should solve @xmath49 nonlinear transcendent equations .",
    "it can be performed for example by the newton - raphson method that requires good initial approximations .",
    "an initial approximation for small @xmath103 and @xmath29 can be obtained with the use of asymptotic formulas .",
    "the analysis of equations ( [ vvz:17 ] ) show that their right side parts at @xmath104 are proportional to @xmath105 ( see ( [ vvz:8 ] ) ) .",
    "it means that @xmath106 for @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible only if functions @xmath86 ,",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath83 , and @xmath82 are close to stepwise ones .",
    "let us introduce the set of intervals @xmath107 $ ] that are not overlapping .",
    "we assume that @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110 are some constants .",
    "then a particular conclusion from ( [ vvz:15 ] ) at @xmath111 is : @xmath112 next we introduce the functions : @xmath113 @xmath114 for an interval @xmath115 we get : @xmath116 @xmath117 the integrating of ( [ vvz:17 ] ) and taking into account notations ( [ vvz:22 ] ) yield : @xmath118 using ( [ vvz:22 ] ) , ( [ vvz:24 ] ) , and ( [ vvz:21 ] ) , the equations @xmath119 for @xmath120 give : @xmath121 the values @xmath110 can be easily found from the boundary condition @xmath122 with the help of ( [ vvz:20 ] ) , ( [ vvz:21 ] ) : @xmath123 expressions ( [ vvz:26 ] ) , ( [ vvz:25 ] ) , ( [ vvz:23 ] ) represent the required initial approximation for @xmath102 , provided that the lengths of intervals @xmath124 , @xmath3 are given .",
    "the main asymptotic term at @xmath101 is given by ( [ vvz:24 ] ) .",
    "the main difficulty in the use of formulas ( [ vvz:25 ] ) , ( [ vvz:26 ] ) is the fact that the lengths of the intervals @xmath125 , @xmath3 are unknown , they can be determined by the next asymptotic terms .",
    "however our numerical experiments have shown that ( at least for @xmath126 ) it is sufficient to take their lengths equal : @xmath127 .",
    "we have shown that asymptotic formulas and numerical results are in good agreement beginning from @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "in particular , the numerical results obtained by a shooting method for the values of parameters @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 are given in table  [ av_tab:1 ] where for the sake of convenience we present the values @xmath139 .",
    "the values @xmath140 in the second raw correspond to their asymptotic values .",
    "one should notice that the formulas ( [ vvz:25 ] ) , ( [ vvz:26 ] ) do not work well for @xmath141 , so for the obtaining of its asymptotic value one has to use an additional procedure that are similar to sect .  [ i:3.0 ] for @xmath142 .",
    "[ av_fig ] shows the concentration distributions @xmath86 and function @xmath83 for two values @xmath143 ( left ) and @xmath134 ( right ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath86 are located successively on the @xmath145-axis in the interval @xmath125 .",
    "the concentration maxima correspond to the isoelectric points @xmath43 . in a classical case when @xmath103 is not too small , function @xmath83 is monotonically decreasing and concentration distributions are close to gaussian ones ( the left frame ) .",
    "the decreasing of @xmath103 ( or the increasing of current density ) causes the ` almost ' stepwise distribution of @xmath83 _ i.e. _ @xmath146 in the intervals @xmath125 and ` almost ' constant concentrations @xmath147 ( the right frame ) .",
