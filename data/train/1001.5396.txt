    "dense neutrino ensambles exhibit collective flavor transformations  @xcite . for supernova ( sn )",
    "neutrinos , these effects imprint intriguing features on the processed spectrum such as spectral splits  @xcite .",
    "collective oscillations originate from a characteristic instability in flavor space of the interacting dense neutrino system that partly swaps its flavor content to minimize its energy . assuming the primary @xmath4 and @xmath5 fluxes exceed those of the other flavors , the dominant effect arises for inverted neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "it is driven by the atmospheric mass difference and the mixing angle @xmath0 that is known to be small and could vanish entirely .",
    "the transformation arising from an instability implies that the processed spectrum is independent of the mixing angle as long as it is small ( collective transformations in the presence of matter are suppressed for maximal mixing because one projects on the interaction direction , but this @xmath6 effect is irrelevant if @xmath7 @xcite ) . in a two - flavor treatment , @xmath8 enters only as a trigger to the subsequent evolution , so in the sn context a very small @xmath8 shifts logarithmically the onset radius for collective transformations @xcite . in numerical studies ,",
    "choosing @xmath8 as small as allowed by the machine precision barely impacts the processed spectrum , although for @xmath9 the system remains stuck in the unstable fixed - point solution defined by the initial conditions .",
    "such a situation looks unphysical  it does not seem plausible that , at least in principle , one can distinguish between @xmath8 being exactly zero and some arbitrarily small but non - zero value .",
    "one may speculate , for example , that quantum fluctuations could trigger the transformation even for @xmath9 @xcite , noting that collective transformations actually preserve flavor lepton number .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to show that in real life we do not need to worry about such subtleties .",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently small , three - flavor effects @xcite trigger the instability and the logarithmic @xmath0 dependence saturates at a small but non - zero value .",
    "why are collective sn neutrino transformations an effective two - flavor phenomenon anyway ? in the outer layers the temperature is too low to support thermal @xmath10 or @xmath11 populations , obviating the possibility to distinguish between @xmath2 and @xmath3 by charged - current reactions . ignoring radiative corrections",
    ", these flavors are exactly equivalent , allowing us to define new flavors @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that effectively @xmath14 . if in addition @xmath1 , one of the new states , say @xmath13 , becomes equivalent to @xmath15 , decoupling entirely from the other flavors : we are left with a two - flavor system consisting of @xmath4 and @xmath12 , governed by @xmath16 and the solar mass difference  @xmath17 .",
    "this system can show collective transformations .",
    "however , the solar mass hierarchy is normal , suppressing the dominant transformation effect if the primary fluxes show the usual excess of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the collective oscillation region is at larger radii because the solar mass difference is small , so multiple - split effects are more easily suppressed by adiabaticity violation @xcite .",
    "however , collective oscillations driven by the solar mass difference do modify the spectra in some scenarios  @xcite .    once we allow for a small but non - vanishing @xmath0 , collective @xmath18 transformations become possible that are driven by the atmospheric mass difference @xmath19 and occur in the usual region of large neutrino flux densities .",
    "our main point is that for @xmath1 these transformations are triggered by small perturbations of the exact @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence because @xmath4 and @xmath12 then no longer form an exact two - flavor system .",
    "such perturbations include radiative corrections to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 matter effect  @xcite , or small @xmath2@xmath3 flux differences .",
    "the latter can be caused by the presence of muons in deeper layers of the sn core and by radiative corrections to the interaction rates , modifying the relative @xmath2 and @xmath3 opacities .",
    "non - standard interactions can also break the @xmath2@xmath3 symmetry @xcite , a possibility that we will not pursue here .",

    "for our conceptual discussion it is sufficient to consider the simplest three - flavor system showing collective transformations . we take the neutrino ensemble to be homogeneous and isotropic , study its time evolution , and describe mixed neutrinos by matrices of densities @xmath20 for each energy mode @xmath21 .",
    "we use an overbar to represent the corresponding quantities for antineutrinos .",

    "we use the standard notation of @xmath28 as the rotation matrix between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 mass eigenstates , with argument @xmath31 . for antineutrinos",
    ", the vacuum hamiltonian picks up a relative minus sign ( ) , whereas all other pieces remain identical . for oscillation studies , we may neglect terms proportional to the identity and may write in the mass basis @xmath32 the solar mass - squared difference @xmath33 , whereas the atmospheric one @xmath34 for inverted mass hierarchy ( ih ) and @xmath35 for normal hierarchy  ( nh ) .",
    "the matter term , due to neutrino interactions with the charged leptons , is in the flavor basis @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the net electron density ( electrons minus positrons ) and similarly for the other leptons .",
    "the second - order term is due to radiative corrections and can be non - negligible at high densities  @xcite .",
    "the contribution associated to @xmath38-@xmath38 interactions is @xmath39 multi - angle effects are ignored in our isotropic system .",
    "radiative corrections can be important in dense neutrino gases at the second order  @xcite .      since we are concerned with a system where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 flavors are exactly or approximately equivalent , it is more useful to introduce new flavors @xmath41 and @xmath42 that simplify the mixing matrix  @xcite @xmath43 here @xmath44 `` unmixes '' @xmath2 and @xmath3 with the angle @xmath45 . for @xmath1 , @xmath13 is the mass eigenstate @xmath15 .",
    "henceforth the interaction basis is understood to be the @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42basis .",
    "this basis is useful because it explicitly removes @xmath45 from the formalism , if the hamiltonian and the initial conditions do not distinguish @xmath46 and @xmath3 . naturally , the evolution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is independent of @xmath45 in this approximation .",
    "the commutator structure of the equations of motion ensures that the trace of @xmath47 is conserved , so we may re - define them to be traceless by subtracting a term proportional to the identity matrix @xmath48 .",
    "the traceless part can be expanded in gell - mann matrices @xmath49 with the expansion coefficients forming an 8-vector @xmath50 .",
    "thus one can project any matrix @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an 8-vector of @xmath54 matrices .",

    "in the approximation that nothing distinguishes between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 flavor , 23 mixing is physically irrelevant and we expect that oscillations reduce to a two - flavor problem .",
    "in fact , for @xmath1 , no collective effects driven by the atmospheric mass difference occur .    to prove this point we study a simplified system consisting of two bloch vectors , representing equal numbers of neutrinos and antineutrinos , with the single vacuum oscillation frequency @xmath88",
    ". for @xmath1 the magnetic field simplifies to @xmath89 where @xmath90 are unit vectors in the 8-dimensional flavor space . assuming exact @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence implies that @xmath91 , and therefore @xmath92 likewise , if the initial @xmath2 and @xmath3 densities are equal , the initial polarization vectors @xmath93 are proportional to the same linear combination of @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the static vectors @xmath96 and @xmath97 have components in the 1 , 3 , and 8 directions , whereas the only dynamical component of @xmath98 , the self - term @xmath99 , develops an @xmath100 component .",

    "the same conclusion is reached if we consider the eom in matrix form .",
    "the part consisting of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 flavor and the @xmath42 flavor form separate block matrices both for the hamiltonian matrix and the matrices of densities . in the @xmath40@xmath41@xmath42 basis and with @xmath1 , the third mass eigenstate @xmath15 is not admixed to the @xmath4 and @xmath12 flavors .",
    "even in the absence of thermal @xmath10 or @xmath11 populations the exact @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence is broken by several sub - leading effects that distinguish between these flavors . in this case",
    ", the @xmath15 flavor does not fully decouple from the @xmath4@xmath12 system and collective transitions driven by the atmospheric mass difference are inevitably triggered .    the first is provided by radiative corrections to the neutrino matter effect where charged leptons appear in the loop . even in the absence of ordinary matter , similar radiative corrections",
    "arise for neutrino - neutrino interactions , although the detailed structure of the eom becomes more complicated  @xcite .",
    "since collective effects require a large density of neutrinos , radiative corrections and thus the breaking of @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence are unavoidable .",
    "finally we note that differences in the initial @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes also provides the required instability .",
    "the presence of matter ( i.e.  @xmath103 ) has a similar effect as decreasing the effective mixing angle , although in detail the dynamics is more complicated . in a frame rotating around @xmath104",
    "there is a fast - rotating transverse @xmath105-field that disturbs the system and triggers the evolution  @xcite .",
    "however , if matter effects distinguish @xmath2 and @xmath3 , they can play a more important role in trigerring collective oscillations , particularly for a small mixing angle .",
    "the largest correction is for @xmath3 where a background of ordinary matter with baryon density @xmath106 has the same refractive effect on @xmath3 and @xmath107 that would be provided by a density of real @xmath11 leptons ( @xmath108 ) @xcite .",

    "this equation should be interpreted as providing the critical value of @xmath0 such that if @xmath118 , the role of @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence breaking is more important than @xmath0 itself , and the two - flavor approximation is not valid anymore .    to demonstrate this",
    ", we consider a toy model with one bloch vector for neutrinos @xmath119 and one for antineutrinos @xmath120 with equal length . in the two - flavor case",

    "moreover , the same radiative effects that create a refractive difference between @xmath2 and @xmath3 also modify the scattering rates and the two flavors will have slightly different opacities and therefore different thermally driven fluxes . obviously the discrete nature of particle emission and thermal fluctuations of the regions emitting the neutrinos would necessarily make the two spectra different .",

    "it is not straightforward to define an effective mixing angle in this case .",
    "the effect of the different fluxes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 is to provide terms proportional to @xmath140 to the @xmath12@xmath13 block in the hamiltonian .",

    ", this symmetry happens to be the @xmath10@xmath11 symmetry - which is explicitly broken .",
    "consequently , collective oscillations are inevitable .",
    "this means that collective oscillations take place as usual even at @xmath1 , once triggered by subleading effects .",
    "another fundamental point is that sn neutrino oscillations are not sensitive to arbitrarily small values of the mixing angle .",

    "<S> however , any effect breaking exact @xmath2@xmath3 equivalence triggers the conversion . </S>",
    "<S> such three - flavor perturbations include radiative corrections to weak interactions , small differences between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 fluxes , or non - standard interactions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , extremely small values of @xmath0 are in practice equivalent , the fate of the system depending only on the neutrino spectra and their mass ordering . </S>"
