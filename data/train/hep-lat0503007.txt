    "twisted mass lattice quantum chromodynamics ( tmlqcd ) is an extension of the familiar wilson lattice action @xcite .",
    "tmlqcd is essentially obtained by introducing a chiral - flavor rotation in the mass term of the wilson action for a quark doublet ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : action ] ) , and it offers a number of significant advantages .",
    "tmlqcd does not suffer from the `` exceptional configurations '' which arise in quenched and partially quenched wilson simulations @xcite due to the existence of unphysical zero modes .",
    "in tmlqcd , @xmath2 improvement ( where @xmath3 is the lattice spacing ) can be implemented in a convenient manner . in particular at maximal twist @xmath2 improvement",
    "is often automatic @xcite , that is , without the addition of a clover term @xcite .",
    "the chiral nature of the rotation leads to parity mixings , but at maximal twist the mixings become mere operator interchanges .",
    "in addition , dynamical tmlqcd simulations @xcite are dramatically less expensive than dynamical chiral fermion simulations , and are claimed to be comparable to the cost of dynamical staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless there are issues @xcite that remain to be understood .",
    "of particular concern in this work is the definition of maximal twist .",
    "the original suggestion of frezzotti and rossi @xcite was to obtain maximal twist by using the critical hopping parameter ( @xmath4 ) from the wilson action .",
    "this procedure ( which we refer to as the wilson @xmath4 definition ) was used in previously published computations @xcite .",
    "however , recent theoretical studies @xcite have suggested that this is generally not precise enough to maintain tmlqcd s @xmath2 improvement for small quark masses ( for another point of view see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and specific alternatives were presented .    in this work , the effect of using different definitions of maximal twist is studied by performing two separate simulations of the quenched hadron spectrum : one using the wilson @xmath4 definition , and the other using a definition which arises by requiring that parity mixing , induced by the twisted mass term , vanish in a physical basis @xcite .",
    "our spectrum calculation includes pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons , and baryons with spin - parity @xmath5 and @xmath6 for a degenerate ( u , d ) quark doublet .",
    "computations were carried out at two lattice spacings and four quark masses .",
    "flavor breaking induced by the chiral - flavor rotation in tmlqcd should be suppressed by powers of the lattice spacing , but need not exactly vanish for a nonzero lattice spacing .",
    "such an effect can be observed in principle as a mass splitting between charged and neutral pions , though the computation of a neutral pion mass involves diagrams with disconnected quark lines and is therefore expensive .",
    "flavor breaking can also arise in a baryon multiplet , such as the isospin-3/2 @xmath1 , which contains states that are not related by u and d quark interchange . in this work",
    ", we calculate this mass splitting which does not involve any disconnected quark line contribution .",
    "section [ sec : action ] contains a brief overview of tmlqcd and the determination of the maximal twist angle is discussed .",
    "details of the simulations and the results are given in sec .",

    "the lagrangian of continuum qcd for two massless quark flavors is invariant under the transformation @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the third pauli matrix in flavor space and @xmath9 is called the twist angle .",
    "when a degenerate quark mass @xmath10 is added , the fermionic part of the lagrangian is no longer invariant .",
    "after the transformation in eq .",
    "( [ fieldtwist ] ) it becomes ( in euclidean notation ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative and the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 will be called , respectively , the standard mass parameter and the twisted mass parameter .",
    "they are given by @xmath15 two choices for the twist angle @xmath9 are of particular interest : @xmath16 causes @xmath14 to vanish and gives the qcd lagrangian in its usual form , while @xmath17 causes @xmath13 to vanish and is referred to as maximal twist .",
    "note that for the continuum action the twist can not effect physics since it can be removed by a field redefinition .",
    "one immediately sees that vector and axial currents get mixed by a general rotation .",
    "for example the charged currents , @xmath18 transform as follows : @xmath19 a tilde has been added to all currents constructed from fields in the twisted basis .",
    "notice that the vector and axial currents do nt mix at maximal twist , but their roles get interchanged .",
    "tmlqcd is obtained when the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ fieldtwist ] ) is applied to the mass term of the wilson lattice qcd action @xcite .",

    "( [ fieldtwist ] ) so , unlike the continuum case of eq .",
    "( [ continuuml ] ) , the chiral twist can not be removed from the action by a field redefinition .",
    "essentially tmlqcd generalizes the wilson fermion action by introducing a relative chiral phase between the mass term and the wilson term .    the mass parameter @xmath22 in eq .  ( [ action ] )",
    "undergoes both additive and multiplicative renormalization , but the twisted mass parameter @xmath14 is only renormalized multiplicatively .",
    "it is usual @xcite to divide @xmath22 into a mass shift @xmath23 and a quark mass excess @xmath13 which plays the same role as the standard mass parameter in eq .",
    "( [ continuuml ] ) .",

    "( [ action ] ) in the twisted basis so we dispense with this separation into mass shift and quark mass excess and simply quote @xmath22 as the standard mass parameter .",
    "various definitions of maximal twist are possible , and they will generally differ by lattice spacing effects",
    ". the wilson @xmath4 definition of maximal twist @xcite is obtained from the standard ( unimproved ) wilson action ( @xmath24 ) by computing the pseudoscalar meson mass as a function of @xmath22 ( equivalently the hopping parameter @xmath25 ) , then extrapolating to vanishing meson mass .",

    "simulations with this definition are discussed in the present work as well , and are compared to a definition of maximal twist arising from considerations of parity conservation .",
    "the tmlqcd action expressed in terms of twisted fields has a parity violating mass term .",
    "this term may be removed by a field redefinition and then the parity violation is associated with the wilson term .",
    "the resulting form of the action is said to be in the physical basis @xcite .",
    "the parity conservation definition of the twist angle comes from demanding the absence of a mixed pseudoscalar - vector matrix element in the physical basis @xcite , @xmath30 with @xmath31 transforming this according to eq .",
    "( [ defv ] ) and noting that @xmath32 is invariant under the transformation of eq .",
    "( [ fieldtwist ] ) , we arrive at @xmath33 where a tilde again denotes currents constructed from fields in the twisted basis .",

    "( @xmath40 denotes the strange quark mass . ) from the point of view of numerical convergence of the propagator calculation , it would be possible to push the calculation to smaller quark masses .",
    "however , that would probably require even higher statistics to get meaningful results so for our first pass we have not tried to probe for the ultimate small quark mass limit .",
