    "although we have relatively few direct constraints on the atmospheric metallicities of extrasolar gas giant planets , current mass and radius measurements suggest an inverse relationship between the planet s bulk metallicity and its mass @xcite . for sub - neptune - sized planets ,",

    "it currently remains an open question as to whether or not the metallicities of exoplanet atmospheres increase with decreasing mass , as models of planet formation indicate that small variations in protoplanetary disks can lead to a broad range of planet masses and compositions @xcite .",

    "previous studies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite indicate that , on average , highly irradiated hot jupiters appear to have inefficient day - night heat recirculation , whereas more weakly irradiated hot jupiters seem to exhibit more efficient day - night circulation albeit with a greater degree of diversity .",

    "we leave these weights as free parameters in our fit , and solve for the values that best match our observed light curves .",
    "we consider versions of the photometry with varying bin sizes , aperture sizes , and with up to two hours of data trimmed from the start of the time series in our fits . by fitting the binned light curves we are able to identify solutions with significantly less red noise on longer time scales and slightly higher scatter on the shortest time scales .",
    "the eclipses of the planets in this study typically have durations of several hours , and we are therefore most sensitive to noise on these time scales in our fits . for each fit",
    "we determine the best - fit model solution using the binned photometry , and then apply our best - fit model to the unbinned light curves in order to generate the plots shown here .",
    "we calculate our best - fit eclipse model and corresponding measurement uncertainties using the version of the photometry that minimizes the amount of time - correlated ( `` red '' ) noise in the residuals after the best - fit model has been removed .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , we evaluate the noise properties of a given set of residuals by calculating the root mean variance of the residuals as a function of bin size , where we step through bin sizes in intervals of powers of two .",
    "if the noise is gaussian and there is no correlation between adjacent data points , we would expect the rms of the binned data to decrease as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the number of points in each bin .",
    "we evaluate the relative amount of red noise in each version of the photometry by taking the difference between a model with the ideal @xmath118 scaling and the observed rms at each bin size , squaring the difference , and summing over all bins in order . by minimizing this least - squares metric",
    ", we can select the version of the photometry which has the least amount of red noise across all time scales ( see fig .",
    "[ rootn_fig ] and [ rootn_fig2 ] ) .",
    "when considering the optimal choice of aperture and bin size , we first identify the version of the photometry with the lowest overall rms variance in the best - fit residuals and discard all of the alternative versions of the photometry with a rms variance that is a factor of 1.2 greater than this value .",
    "this ensures that we avoid solutions that minimize the red noise component by significantly increasing the amount of white noise ( these are usually the largest apertures , where the sky background contributes additional noise ) .",
    "we then pick the bin size and photometric aperture that has the smallest amount of red noise as measured by our least squares metric .",
    "we find that there is an exponential ramp visible at the start of some visits , which is a well - known feature of the irac 3.6 and 4.5  arrays and has a shape that varies depending on the illumination history of the array immediately prior to each observation as well as the brightness of the target star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we remove this ramp by trimming data from the start of each light curve . after identifying the optimal bin size and aperture choice ,",
    "we determine the correct amount of data to trim by examining the best light curve after detector effects have been removed and trimming until no ramp is visible at the start of the observations .",
    "we then revisit our choice of bin size and aperture with the new trim duration in order to make sure that our previous choice is still the best one with the new trim interval . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rootn_fig ] and [ rootn_fig2 ] , this results in light curves with no detectible red noise component on the time scales spanned by our observations .",
    "we also calculate a lomb - scargle periodogram for the best - fit residuals from our nominal light curve for each visit and find that for periods between five minutes and five hours there are no peaks in the power spectrum with false alarm probabilities lower than @xmath120 . as a final step , we check to make sure that we obtain eclipse depths that are consistent at the @xmath121 level across different versions of the photometry that meet our @xmath122 excess noise threshold and have minimal red noise components .",
    "we use the routines described in @xcite in order to generate our eclipse light curves , where we set the planet - star radius ratio , orbital inclination , and the ratio of the orbital semi - major axis to the stellar radius equal to their best - fit values from previous studies ( see table [ table : tab1 ] for a complete list of references for each planet ) .",
    "we assume a circular orbit for the purpose of calculating the eclipse shape and duration , as there is no evidence for an orbital eccentricity large enough to appreciably alter the eclipse duration ( _ e _ sin @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the orbital eccentricity and @xmath125 is the longitude of periastron ) in any of these systems .",
    "we allow the individual eclipse depths and center of eclipse times to vary as free parameters in our fits .",
    "for the second @xmath126  eclipse observations of hat - p-19b and both 3.6  observations of wasp-67b the eclipse is detected with marginal significance and we therefore place a gaussian prior on the phase of the secondary eclipse in order to reduce the corresponding uncertainties on the eclipse depth .",

    "we find that the use of this prior changes the best - fit eclipse depth for the second 4.5  observation of hat - p-19b by less than @xmath128 , while reducing the measurement error on this depth by @xmath129 as compared to a fit with no constraint on the center of eclipse phase . for consistency",
    ", we apply the same prior to the first 4.5  eclipse observation of hat - p-19b , which is detected with a significance of @xmath130 in fits with the standard uniform prior on the eclipse phase .",
    "we find that in this fit the use of the prior has no effect on the best - fit eclipse depth and reduces the measurement error in this parameter by @xmath131 , as expected for a case where the data themselves provide good constraints on the eclipse time .",
    "for wasp-67b our 3.6  fits with a uniform prior prefer an eclipse solution at a much earlier phase with a best - fit eclipse depth that is consistent with zero at the @xmath121 level .",
    "we therefore conclude that this is likely a local minimum in @xmath127 caused by a trade - off with the instrumental noise model , and place a prior on the eclipse phase based on the measured 4.5  eclipse phase .",
    "this allows us to obtain new constraints on the eclipse depth at 3.6  for a range of phases consistent with the measured 4.5  eclipses .",
    "we determine the best fit model for each individual eclipse using a levenberg - marquardt minimization routine , where each fit has thirteen free parameters .",
    "in addition to the nine pixel weight parameters and two eclipse parameters , we also fit for a linear function of time in order to account for long - term instrumental and stellar trends .",
    "figures [ rawfig ] and [ rawfig2 ] show the raw photometry , while figures [ normfig ] and [ normfig2 ] show the corresponding normalized photometry after dividing out the best - fit pld model and linear function of time .",
    "we estimate the corresponding uncertainties on our model parameters using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis with @xmath132 steps per chain , where we define the @xmath121 uncertainties as the symmetric interval around the median parameter value containing 68% of the total probability .",
    "we assume uniform priors on all parameters with the exception of the 3.6  eclipse phase of wasp-67b and the 4.5  eclipse phase for hat - p-19b as noted in the previous paragraph .",
    "we initialize our chains using the best - fit solution from the levenberg - marquardt minimization in order to minimize the burn - in time .",
    "we then check to see where the @xmath127 value of the chain first drops below the median value over the entire chain , and trim all points prior to this step in order to remove any residual burn - in phase .",
    "we also examine our resulting posterior probability distributions in order to make sure that our choice of prior bounds is broad enough that it does not affect our final results , and re - run our chain with a broader prior range if required .",
    "although we find that individual pixel weights are often degenerate with each other , our probability distributions for the best - fit eclipse depths and center of eclipse times are gaussian and uncorrelated with the other fit parameters , with the exception of the 3.6  eclipse of wasp-6b which we discuss in more detail below .",
    "the correlation between pixel weights could be mitigated by a transformation to an independent set of basis vectors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but as these correlations do not affect our final best - fit eclipse parameters and their corresponding uncertainties we do not pursue this option here .",
    "we find that our measured center of eclipse time for wasp-6b s 3.6  eclipse has an uncertainty that is significantly larger ( 15 minutes ) than is typical for our other observations with statistically significant eclipse detections .",
    "we examined the results from our mcmc analysis and identified a correlation between the slope of the linear trend across the 3.6  micron  eclipse and the measured center of eclipse time in this visit ( see fig .",
    "[ wasp6_pdf ] ) . as discussed earlier , we found it necessary to trim the first 1.5 hours of data in order to remove an unusually long - lived ramp at the start of these observations .",
    "this trimming means that we have a relatively short baseline prior to the start of the eclipse , and it is therefore not surprising that there might be a correlation between the eclipse time and the linear trend in our fits .",
    "our best - fit eclipse depth for this visit does not appear to be correlated with either of these parameters , and we find no evidence for a similar correlation between eclipse time and linear trend slope in other visits with short pre - eclipse baselines .",

    "published optical transmission spectra for wasp-6b indicate that it does indeed possess a high altitude cloud layer @xcite , but there are no published transmission spectra available for hat - p-19b , wasp-10b , wasp-39b , or wasp-67b . if these planets possess a cloud layer that is optically thick when viewed during secondary eclipse , we would expect such a cloud layer to suppress the strengths of the observed molecular absorption or emission features , leading to a more blackbody - like spectrum .",
    "hat - p-19b has a dayside emission spectrum that is moderately inconsistent with that of a pure blackbody , which should produce a planet - star flux ratio that increases consistently towards longer wavelengths .",
    "wasp-6b , wasp-10b , wasp-39b , and wasp-67b are closer to a blackbody shape , and we therefore can not exclude the possibility that their dayside emission spectra are affected by clouds .",
    "however , we note that the transit technique is sensitive to more tenuous clouds and hazes than the secondary eclipse technique , as the slant optical path length traveled by light transmitted through the planet s atmosphere is longer than the radial path traveled by light emitted by the planet @xcite .",
    "gj 436b serves as a useful case in point , as it has an apparently featureless infrared transmission spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but still exhibits strong spectral features in its dayside emission spectrum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although our constraints on the atmospheric properties of planets in individual cases are limited by the signal to noise of our measurements , it is possible that the aggregate sample may display trends that are not apparent on a case - by - case basis .",
    "we therefore examine the properties of the planets in our sample using a series of model - independent metrics that allow us to construct a view of the global properties of this population .",
    "we begin by calculating the ratio of the 4.5 to 3.6  brightness temperatures for each planet ; this ratio is independent of both the planet - star radius ratio and the effective temperatures of the planet and star , and instead simply reflects the relative shape of each planet s emission spectrum as determined by the presence of any molecular absorption or emission features .",
    "if we assume that molecular features are observed in absorption ( i.e. , none of the planets have dayside temperature inversions ) , we would expect the ratio of the 4.5 to 3.6  brightness temperatures to vary primarily as a function of atmospheric metallicity . in this scenario",

    "we evaluate the statistical significance of this trend by taking the error - weighted average brightness ratio for planets with masses less than 0.3 m@xmath28 and comparing this ratio to the error - weighted average ratio for planets with masses greater than 0.5 m@xmath28 .",

    "we next evaluate the relative efficiency of circulation between the day and night sides of these planets by comparing their observed versus predicted dayside emission temperatures as described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we convert the set of individual dayside brightness temperatures across all bandpasses into a combined dayside effective temperature using two different schemes : error - weighted mean ( wavelengths with small uncertainties contribute most to the estimate ) and power - weighted mean ( wavelengths that capture large fractions of the planetary emission contribute most to the estimate ) . the uncertainty in the averaged dayside effective temperature and in its ratio with the planet s irradiation temperature",
    "is then estimated using a 1000-step monte carlo method with equal numbers of trials drawn from each scheme ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "we use the ratio of the measured vs predicted ( irradiation ) dayside temperatures to determine whether or not the correlation between planet mass and day - night circulation efficiency inferred in our cool planet sample is consistent with the larger sample of published secondary eclipse data for transiting gas giant planets with a range of incident flux levels .",

    "although our results are less well constrained for the smaller planets in our sample , we examine their aggregate properties by taking the ratio of the 3.6 to 4.5  brightness temperatures and plotting this ratio as a function of planet mass and temperature .",

    "we note that with just two wavelengths of data our ability to constrain the atmospheric metallicities of these planets is degenerate with other atmospheric properties , including the presence or absence of dayside temperature inversions as well as the potential effects of high altitude cloud layers .",
