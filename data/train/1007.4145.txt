    "monte carlo sampling techniques can not be applied to systems with large chemical potential due to the fermionic sign problem .",
    "it is therefore desirable to explore alternative approaches .    in the last few years",
    ", tensor network algorithms have received increasing attention as variational , non - perturbative methods to study spin lattice systems . the simplest tensor network variational ansatz , the matrix product state@xcite ( mps ) , is the basis of white s extremely successful density matrix renormalization group@xcite ( dmrg ) algorithm to compute the ground state of spin chains .",
    "several generalizations of the mps to two and larger spatial dimensions exist both for spin and fermionic systems , such as the projected entangled - pair states@xcite(peps ) , also referred to as tensor product states , and the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz@xcite ( mera ) , both of which lead to scalable simulations . since tensor network algorithms do not suffer from the sign problem , they are suitable to study problems beyond the reach of monte carlo techniques .",
    "recent calculations include frustrated antiferromagnets@xcite and interacting fermions@xcite in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the use of tensor network techniques within the hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory .",
    "we will consider the simplest non - trivial case , namely @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions@xcite , with a hamiltonian that contains the usual kinetic and potential terms for the gauge field and no fermionic matter .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the theory , which we aim to reproduce , is already well understood , due e.g. to previous studies using monte carlo techniques .",
    "therefore the aim of the present paper is not to uncover new physics , but rather to describe a new approach and to confirm its validity in a well - known , simple context .",
    "the merit of the present strategy resides in that it can be generalized to more complex settings beyond the reach of monte carlo techniques .    in this work",
    "we will describe ( i ) a coarse - graining scheme for the lattice model specifically designed to preserve and exploit its local @xmath0 symmetry ; ( ii ) a variational ansatz for the ground state(s ) and low energy states of theory ; and ( iii ) numerical results to illustrate the potential of the approach .",

    "the hopping term of the gauge field is implemented by deforming the toric code with a magnetic field , as investigated in refs . .",
    "in the deformed toric code model , the @xmath0 group is a local symmetry of the spin hamiltonian , and states are not forced to be gauge invariant . in particular , excited states exist that are gauge covariant .",
    "such states can be understood as describing the presence of static matter in specific locations of the lattice .",
    "our variational ansatz can also represent such states .",
    "previous related work can be divided into two categories . on the one hand ,",
    "sugihara@xcite has investigated the use of a mps to describe the ground state of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory in quasi - one dimensional systems , both directly or through a mapping to the quantum ising model .",
    "we notice that no attempt is made to adapt the mps , primarily a tensor network for one - dimensional systems ( where @xmath0 lattice gauge theory is trivial ) to the presence of the symmetry .",
    "on the other hand , schuch , cirac and perez - garcia@xcite , as well as swingle and wen@xcite , have recently considered a peps representation of a state of a two dimensional lattice with topological order and have investigated how to extract topological information from it , while chen et al.@xcite have stressed the importance of explicitly preserving certain symmetry in a peps in order to represent topological order .",
    "in contrast with the present work , where we propose and benchmark an algorithm to compute the ground state(s ) of a two dimensional system with topological order ( in some limiting regime ) or , relatedly , of @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , none of these previous contributions explains how to actually obtain , given a hamiltonian of a topologically ordered system , a tensor network representation of its ground state(s ) .",

    "[ sec : coarse ] , the lattice model is coarse - grained by means of a transformation that breaks into two parts @xmath9 and @xmath16 .",
    "the first part @xmath9 can be viewed as a local version of the duality transformation to the quantum ising model .",
    "the spin model is divided into blocks of spins , and within each block a duality transformation to the ising model is implemented .",
    "this produces two types of spins : at the boundary between blocks , spins which have not yet been mapped to the ising model ( referred to as _ constrained _ spins ) and in the interior of each block , spins that have been mapped to the ising model ( referred to as _ free _ spins ) .",
    "the second part @xmath16 of the coarse - graining transformation replaces the free spins inside a block with a single , effective _",
    "free _ spin .",
    "the resulting effective spin model contains _ constrained _ spins interspersed with _",
    "free _ spins .",
    "importantly , the local @xmath0 symmetry , which acts on the constrained spins only , is _ exactly preserved _ during the coarse - graining .",
    "in addition , thanks to applying duality mappings to the ising model only within each block of spins , the coarse - graining transformation is completely _ local _ : any local operator of the original model is mapped into a local operator of the effective model .",
    "finally , composition of coarse - graining transformations reduces a finite system to a small number of spins , which can be addressed with exact diagonalization . as it is costumary in tensor network algorithms , a _",
    "variational ansatz _ for e.g. the ground state of the model is then obtained by regarding the coefficients that characterize the coarse - graining transformation as variational parameters .",
    "thus , one of the highlights of the approach is that it produces a tensor network representation of the wave function of the ground state ( and low energy states ) of the model , from which the expectation value of arbitrary local observables can be computed .",
    "we notice here that , depending on the choice of transformation @xmath16 , namely depending on whether @xmath16 incorporates _ disentanglers _ or not , our approach can consider arbitrarily large systems or is restricted to small lattices . in the first case , one can study the renormalization group flow to a fixed point ( in preparation ) . in the second case , on which we will concentrate here in addition to local observables one can also evaluate non - local order parameters , wilson loops and ground state fidelities , see sect . [",
    "sec : bench ] .    as it is costumary in most tensor network algorithms , entanglement is central to the present discussion .",
    "the more entangled a system is , the more costly it is to simulate it with a tensor network ansatz .",
    "an important aspect of our work is that it highlights the potential role of duality transformations in transforming a strongly entangled ground state into a weakly entangled one , which is then suitable for tensor network algorithms .",
    "in particular , the toric code for small magnetic field has a robustly entangled ground state that is mapped into an ising model with large magnetic field , whose ground state is only weakly entangled , see fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglement ] .",
    "a key of our approach is then to be able to map the model to its less entangled dual while preserving locality .",
    "this is precisely the role of @xmath9 . after the entanglement in the ground state",
    "has been reduced significantly , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : entanglement ] , @xmath16 can proceed to coarse - grain the system by discarding high energy degrees of freedom .",
    "the reduction of entanglement obtained with @xmath9 significantly decreases computational costs . as a result , with a fixed computational cost ( as parameterized by some refinement parameter @xmath13 ,",
    "[ sec : bench ] ) , use of @xmath9 produces an improvement of four orders of magnitude in the estimate of the ground state energy in a @xmath10 lattice , as shown in fig [ fig : bare ] . as a side remark",
    "the entanglement structure of the same lattice gauge theory we consider here has also been studied in ref . .",

    "finally , we also discuss how to compose several layers of coarse - graining and how to build a variational ansatz for low energy states of the original model .",
    "let us restate our goal .",
    "we would like to build an isometric transformation @xmath208 , @xmath271 to coarse - grain the deformed toric code model , @xmath272 defined on a lattice @xmath4 made of @xmath18 sites ( or @xmath273 spins ) , as reviewed in sect .",

    "@xmath274 , the entire low energy subspace of @xmath6 is made of states that are invariant under the local symmetry , eq . [ eq : star ] .",
    "we next discuss two simple options .",
    "a first option is to proceed with a _",
    "coarse - graining scheme that ignores the presence of the local @xmath0 symmetry or , at most , merely exploits the global @xmath0 symmetry given by @xmath275 in this case , one could consider a transformation @xmath208 made of several types of disentanglers and isometries along the lines of the schemes used to study other two - dimensional lattice models with entanglement renormalization @xcite .",
    "notice that the local symmetry , arguably a fundamental property of the model , will in general not be protected against numerical errors that may occur during a bare coarse - graining transformation .",
    "in addition , several attempts in this direction ( see e.g. fig . [",
    "fig : bare ] ) indicate that , while it is possible to coarse - grain the system without exploiting the local symmetry , the computational cost of applying the bare approach to the deformed toric code is prohibitively large in the deconfined phase of the model , @xmath276 , due to the presence of large amounts of entanglement , as illustrated in fig . [",
    "fig : entanglement ] .",
    "it might therefore be more convenient to exploit the local @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the symmetry introduces local constraints on the degrees of freedom of the model , implying that the vector space @xmath207 of the theory is redundantly large .",
    "it is possible to exploit these constraints to obtain an equivalent description in a smaller vector space , and to then build the coarse - graining transformation directly on the reduced vector space . as reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : z2:lgt ] , when @xmath274 , projection onto the low energy subspace leads to the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory , with hamiltonian @xmath277 where @xmath278 was set to @xmath279 without loss of generality .",
    "recall that this model can be mapped into the quantum ising model@xcite , as reviewed in sect .",
    "[ sec : z2:duality ] , @xmath280 where different topological sectors of @xmath6 correspond to different boundary conditions for @xmath168 .",
    "this is the reduced description we were looking for .",
    "therefore a second option is to first transform the low energy sector of the deformed toric code @xmath6 ( with @xmath274 ) into the ising model @xmath168 ; then to apply coarse - graining techniques to determine the ground state phase diagram of the ising model @xmath168 ; and , finally , to translate the results back to the deformed toric code model by undoing the duality transformation .",
    "this is indeed a viable option . as a matter of fact",
    ", entanglement renormalization techniques have already been used to coarse - grain the quantum ising model and study its ground state phase diagram @xcite . in particular , with the specific layout of disentanglers and isometries proposed in ref . , it was possible to study arbitrarily large lattices .",
    "the presence of a smaller amount of entanglement in the ground state of @xmath168 , as compared to the ground state of @xmath6 , explains why the coarse - graining strategy has a lower computational cost for the ising model than for the deformed toric code model .",
    "this second approach can be extended to all those models with a local symmetry such that their low energy subspace is dual to a simpler model .",
    "this is the case , for instance , of the quantum double model@xcite for any discrete abelian group @xmath281 , whose low energy sector ( if one allows only for certain type of excitations ) corresponds to the @xmath281 lattice gauge theory , which in turn is dual to the @xmath282-state potts model with a transverse magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it seems , however , that for non - abelian groups , an analogous duality transformation produces a highly non - local model @xcite .    in spite of its simplicity , this second approach also has several drawbacks .",
    "let us discuss two of them .    _",
    "vacancy. _ the duality transformation produces an ising model with a vacancy that breaks translation invariance .",
    "while this may not be relevant in the thermodynamic limit , the presence of a vacancy in a finite system implies that the coarse - graining transformation can not be homogeneous . as a result , for instance , the cost of simulations with the mera increases from @xmath283 for a translation invariant system to @xmath284 for an inhomogeneous system .",
    "_ weak non - locality. _ another , more fundamental limitation of using the duality is that this transformation is not local , as reflected by the presence of two non - local , boundary spins in the ising model , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ising2 ] .",
    "we refer to the resulting model as being _",
    "weakly _ non - local , since its hamiltonian is still local in the bulk .",
    "a particular topological sector of @xmath6 can be studied by just fixing these boundary qubits to some product state , corresponding to fixing the boundary conditions of @xmath168 , in which case the model is completely local . however , in a finite system it might be of interest to study processes that simultaneously involve several topological sectors of the model .",
    "these processes can still be studied with the resulting ising model by allowing the boundary spins of fig . [",
    "fig : ising2 ] to be entangled with the rest of the spins .",
    "however , each boundary spin is coupled to @xmath200 neighbouring spins .",
    "this level of non - locality is expected to produce large amounts of entanglement , with a subsequent increase in computational costs , possibly rendering the approach too expensive .      finally , there are two fundamental reasons why in this work we explore an alternative coarse - graining transformation that is not based on simply mapping the low energy subspace of @xmath6 into @xmath168 .",
    "one is that our ultimate goal is to develop a systematic approach that can also be applied to locally symmetric models and lattice gauge theories with a more general symmetry group , such as e.g. non - abelian groups , and not just to cases where a duality transformation exists to a simpler model ( as is the case for finite abelian groups @xmath281 @xcite ) . in other words ,",
    "we use the deformed toric code , arguably the simplest possible example , for illustrative purposes only . the coarse - graining transformation described below",

    ", as well as to string - net models@xcite by using the results of ref . .",
    "the second reason is that we are interested in a scheme that can be generalized to models with a hamiltonian where the local symmetry is explicitly broken ( for the deformed toric code , by adding e.g. an additional magnetic field @xmath285 to @xmath6 ) but such that the local symmetry is still recovered at low energies . in this broader context ,",
    "the map to the ising model is strongly non - local , in that each @xmath286 is transformed into a string operator , whereas the coarse - graining scheme presented here can be suitably extended in a way that locality is strictly preserved , as discussed in subsequent work .",
