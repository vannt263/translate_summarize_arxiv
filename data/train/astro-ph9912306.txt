    "spatially extended emission - line regions are commonplace around steep - spectrum radio - loud quasars ; at low ( stockton & mackenty 1987 , hereafter sm87 ; crawford , fabian & johnstone 1988 ; hutchings & crampton 1990 ; durret 1994 ; boisson 1994 ) , intermediate ( crawford & fabian 1989 ; forbes 1990 ; hutchings 1992 ; bremer 1992 ; ridgway & stockton 1998 ) and high redshift ( heckman 1991a , b ) .",
    "the gas emits strongly in the coolants of ly@xmath1 , and over radii of tens to a hundred  from the quasar nucleus , thus providing a relatively direct way to study of the immediate environment of a quasar beyond its host galaxy .",
    "the spatial distribution of the ionized gas appears highly structured into clumps and filaments , but does not appear to be well correlated with any extended continuum structure ( sm87 ) . despite the statistical association of the presence of an eelr with steep - spectrum radio emission , few objects at low",
    "redshift show any clear morphological relation of the extended emission - line region ( eelr ) to the extended radio source structure ( sm87 ; he s , barthel & fosbury 1996 ) .",
    "an alignment of the principal axes is seen more obviously at at earlier epochs ( heckman 1991a , b ; crawford & vanderriest 1997 ; ridgway & stockton 1998 ) .    the distribution of the ionized gas and extended continuum ( particularly when elongated into putative tidal tails )",
    "is often taken as indicative of the emitting gas  and probably the quasar nuclear activity  originating in a gravitational interaction between the quasar host galaxy and a nearby companion ( sm87 ; hutchings & neff 1992 ; stockton & ridgway 1991 ; durret 1994 ; chatzichristou , vanderriest & jaffe 1999 ) . the kinematic structure of the ionized gas , however , where mapped shows no obvious organized pattern , being chaotic and sometimes split into several velocity components ( hickson & hutchings 1987 ; durret 1994 ) .",
    "off - nuclear spectroscopy of the extended oxygen emission shows the emitting gas to be of surprisingly low ionization given its proximity to a luminous quasar nucleus ( crawford & fabian 1989 ; forbes 1990 ; bremer 1992 ; boisson 1994 ; heckman etal 1991a ; crawford & vanderriest 1997 ) . the pressure of the gas is deduced to be high , typically @xmath2  within 20  of the quasar ; if unconfined , this will disperse rapidly on less than a crossing time . to avoid this ",
    "given the frequent occurrence of such systems and their apparently chaotic velocity structure  either an exceptionally large reservoir of neutral gas is required , or the eelr must be confined within a high - pressure environment.the inferred pressure is consistent with that in the hot intracluster medium of groups and clusters of galaxies ( eg fabian 1994 and references therein ) .",
    "there is plentiful additional evidence from other wavebands to support the idea that powerful intermediate-(and higher-)redshift radio sources lie in environments richer than the field : from excess galaxy counts ( yee & green 1984 , 1987 ; yates et al 1989 ; hill & lilly 1991 ; ellingson , yee & green 1991 ; dickinson 1997 ) , host continuum profiles that resemble cd galaxies ( best et al 1998 ) and gravitational lensing signatures ( bower & smail 1997 ; deltorn et al 1997 ) , to asymmetric faraday radio depolarization ( garrington & conway 1991 ) , sources with very high faraday rotation measures ( carilli 1994 , 1997 ) and direct x - ray detection of the environment ( crawford & fabian 1993 ; worrall 1994 ; crawford & fabian 1995 , 1996a , b ; crawford 1999 ; dickinson 1999 ; hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) . a surrounding intracluster medium could possibly provide fuel for the nuclear activity from a cooling flow gravitationally focussed to the quasar ( fabian & crawford 1990 ) .    much of the previous work on quasar eelrs",
    "has had to rely on either narrow - band imaging of the whole structure , or spectroscopy of only a small region of the gas . in this paper",
    "we present optical area spectroscopy of a small sample of low redshift ( @xmath3 ) radio - loud quasars in order to gain a complete picture of the ionized gas by combining direct information on its distribution , ionization state and kinematics over the whole nebula .",
    "connections and comparisons can then be made both directly between these properties and those of the associated radio source .    only a few low- to intermediate - redshift quasars have been previously targeted using integral field spectroscopy .",
    "durret ( 1994 ) presented optical area spectroscopy of three low - redshift quasars , two of which are in common with the sample presented here .",
    "the eelr were found to have a clumpy distribution , with discrete blobs embedded in a more diffuse envelope surrounding the quasar .",
    "the velocity fields were chaotic , not simply fit by a single rotating disk model .",
    "we have presented area spectroscopy data of the exceptional line emission associated with the @xmath4 radio - loud quasar 3c254 ( crawford & vanderriest 1997 ) .",
    "the argus instrument used ( vanderriest 1995 ; chatzichristou etal 1999 ) allows a larger aperture and a wider wavelength range to be used than the tigre system in durret ( 1994 ) .",
    "the kinematics and distribution of the large eelr around 3c254 strongly indicate an interaction of a radio jet with a dense cloud of ionized gas ; however this appears to have little effect on the ionization state of the gas , which remains low in this region .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : we detail the observations and data reduction in section 2 ; section 3 presents a brief introduction to and our results on each of the six quasars in order of increasing redshift ; we summarize and discuss our findings in section 4 ; finally , conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we selected our targets from those radio - loud quasars already known to possess spatially extended emission - line regions at the time of the observations , and with a redshift @xmath5 such that both the dominant emission lines of and could be observed .",
    "in addition , we chose quasars with a range of radio source properties  from fairly compact to very extended  from those thought to lie in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "additional considerations included whether an x - ray flux from the quasar was known at the time , enabling a better knowledge of the photo - ionizing continuum from the nucleus .",
    "the targets were observed using the integral field spectroscopy device argus on the canada - france - hawaii telescope during the nights of 1993 june 24 - 27 , except for the observation of 3c215 which was observed on the night of 1995 jan 7 .",
    "argus is an additional mode to the mos - sis spectrograph on the cfht ( vanderriest 1995 ) which uses a flexible bundle of optical fibres to transform independent spectra collected at an @xmath6 arcsec hexagonal aperture in the cassegrain focal plane , into a pseudo long - slit for collimation through the mos .",
    "each fibre has a diameter of 0.4 arcsec , and the spectral range and resolution of the observation are determined only by the ccd and grism used in mos , the same for all the field of view .",
    "the weather conditions were photometric , with seeing conditions typically just sub - arcsecond .",
    "the total exposure on each quasar was obtained by co - adding consecutive observations of 1500 - 2500  each ; a log of observations is given in table  [ tab : obslog ] .",
    "the loral  3 ccd was used with the o300 grism , leading to a wavelength coverage of 39809680  ( the combined ccd and grism efficiency is effectively zero below 3980 ) at a dispersion of 3  per pixel and a spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the argus aperture was oriented with north to the top of the aperture for all the observations in june  1993 , and with north toward the top left - hand corner of the aperture for the observation of 3c215 in jan  1995 .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]      @xmath1 for all bands is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "+ @xmath9 has been corrected for the over - steepening of pspc spectra of @xmath10 , as mentioned in the text .",
    "+ @xmath11 @xmath12 can only be constrained to be a lower limit where only a lower limit to the [ oiii]/ratio can be measured .",
    "+    the quasar continuum is assumed incident on a neutral gas cloud at the projected radius of the eelr from which the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratios shown in table  [ tab : linerats ] and figs  [ fig : allrats ] and [ fig:4c37.43bpt ] are extracted .",
    "the cloud parameters are varied in cloudy until the runs predict a good match to the observed line ratios .",
    "the pressures deduced within the eelr of all six quasars show a very similar and high range of values , all over @xmath13  for projected radii of 15 - 25  from the nucleus ( figs  [ fig : allpress ] and [ fig:4c37.43press ] ) .",
    "uncertainties in these estimates are due to the errors in the [ oii]/[oiii ] ratio from the emission - line fitting , typically around @xmath1435 per cent ; uncertainties in the temperature of the ` blue bump ' , where the errors in [ oiii]/could change the bump temperature and thus the inferred pressure by typically @xmath1420 per cent .",
    "the main potential source for error is the range in radius over which the line ratios are averaged ; at the inner ( outer ) part of this range the same line ratio would match a gas pressure typically a factor of two greater ( smaller ) than that inferred .",
    "this error margin is shown by the error diamonds in the fig  [ fig : allpress ] , where the error bars represent the errors due to the uncertainty only in the measurement of the [ oiii]/[oii ] line ratio .",
    "note though , that the lower limit to the temperature of the bump in 3c281 and 3c215 implies that the pressures inferred could also be greater at a given distance .",
    "the pressures inferred within the extended emission - line regions around the six quasars are all compatible with those measured in the intracluster medium of nearby clusters of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the range of pressures deduced are consistent with a moderate cooling flow ( of tens to a couple of hundred solar masses a year ) operating in the nearby environment of the quasar .",
    "the radial pressure profile of the ionized gas around 4c37.43 has a proportionality of @xmath15 ( fig  [ fig:4c37.43press ] ) .",
    "this is compatible with the eelr being in pressure equilibrium with hot gas following the @xmath16 distribution expected for distributed mass deposition in an isothermal halo . for comparison , in fig  [ fig:4c37.43press ]",
    "we also plot the pressure profile derived from a deprojection of rosat hri x - ray data of a3581 from johnstone , fabian & taylor ( 1998 ) .",
    "a3581 is an interesting analogy to 4c37.43 , as it is a poor cluster , hosting the fr  ii radio source pks1404 - 267 at its core .",
    "the x - ray data show a moderate cooling flow with a mass deposition rate of @xmath17to be occurring within the intracluster medium .",
    "the similarity of its pressure profile to our optically - deduced ones supports the inference of a cooling flow around these quasars , despite the fact that only three ( 3c215 , 3c281 and 3c323.1 ) lie in environments that can be classified from field optical galaxy counts as richer than abell class 0 ( ellingson 1991 ; yee & green 1984 , 1987 ; 3c334 and 4c11.72 lie less clustered regions , and 4c37.43 lies in a comparatively sparse environment . ) in a hierarchical model for the evolution of clusters , it may well be that quasars  and their relatively undisturbed cooling flows  can only survive to lower redshifts in the _ poorer _ clusters that are sufficiently isolated to have so far escaped merging with richer systems ( see e.g. fabian & crawford 1990 ) .",
    "our interpretation is also supported by the recent direct detections of the x - ray emission from the host clusters of 3c215 , 3c281 and 3c334 ( among a handful of such detections ; crawford 1999 ; hardcastle & worrall 1999 ) support this suggestion .",
    "in these cases , the extended x - ray component is consistent with thermal emission from the intracluster medium of moderately rich host clusters to the quasars , with inner regions dense enough to be part of a cooling flow .",
    "five out of six of our quasars are associated with radio sources that are over 200  in diameter ( table  [ tab : nebprops ] ) . amongst these",
    "are three with settled or quiescent kinematic behaviour ( 3c323.1 , 3c334 and 3c215 ) , and one with a little ( 3c281 ) and one with a large ( 4c37.43 ) amount of velocity structure .",
    "the quasar with the smallest contained radio source , 4c11.72 , not surprisingly has the most kinematically active eelr .",
    "naively this mostly conforms to the similar division of behaviour seen in the emission - line nebulae of higher - redshift radio galaxies by best 1999 , whereby the radio sources with smaller linear sizes ( @xmath18 ) show clear indications of physical interactions between the radio and optical plasmas , in terms of kinematic behaviour , ionization state and flux .",
    "larger systems have eelrs more consistent with photo - ionization by an embedded quasar .",
    "we can not test for the role of shock ionization in our sources as the diagnostic uv lines are not observable at the redshifts of our sample ; and do not allow us to clearly discriminate between these possibilities . however , we note that any extra sources of ionization ( such as shocks from jet - cloud interactions ) will act to exacerbate the high pressures inferred from the low ionization state of the eelr .",
    "the exception to this model is the eelr around 4c37.43 , which shows clear regions of higher ionization aligned along the radio axis . although only associated with an increased fwhm to the north - west side of the quasar , it is possible that extra ionization in the form of shocks may produce this ionization differential within the nebula .",
    "we have presented two - dimensional maps of the distribution , velocity structure and ionization state of the extended emission - line regions around six intermediate - redshift quasars .",
    "the eelrs show a diverse behaviour in morphology  including relation to the radio source axis  and kinematics . despite this ,",
    "they all have surprisingly similar  and low  ionization , as measured by the ratio of and .",
    "we thus infer a confining medium around all the quasars to sustain the eelr at such low ionization in the proximity of a strong ionizing quasar nucleus .",
    "csc thanks both the pparc and the royal society for financial support while this work was in progress .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
    "we have also made use of data obtained from the leicester database and archive service at the department of physics and astronomy , leicester university .",
