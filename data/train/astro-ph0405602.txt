    "the possibility that grb fireballs are collimated was first proposed for grb  970508 ( waxman et al . 1998 ) and subsequently invoked for grb  990123 as a possible explanation for its extraordinarily large isotropic energy ( fruchter et al .",
    "the observational evidence supporting this scenario is the achromatic break of the afterglow light curve which declines more steeply than in the spherical case ( e.g. rhoads 1997 , sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) . under the simplifying assumption of a constant circum - burst density medium of number density @xmath5",

    "the different slopes of the @xmath3@xmath14 ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) and the @xmath3@xmath51 correlations imply that they will intersect at some small value of @xmath79 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the precise value of the intersection depends mainly on the uncertainties in the @xmath3@xmath14 relation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ( dashed and dot  dashed lines ) . at any rate , bursts lying in this region of the @xmath3@xmath80 plane would be characterized , on average , by a nearly isotropic emission , small peak energies ( possibly in the uv / soft  x  ray range ) and by @xmath2 smaller than @xmath81 erg.ray emission was isotropic . ]",
    "recently , it has also been shown ( liang et al . 2004 ) that the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath14 ( found from the time - averaged spectrum ) holds when considering the time resolved spectral analysis of grbs .",
    "similarly , due to the much lower scatter ( a factor @xmath28 5.7 lower ) around the @xmath3 and @xmath51 correlation , we expect that considering the time resolved spectral peak energy @xmath82 and collimation corrected energy @xmath83 a possibly even less scattered correlation should hold within single grbs .",
    "this , in turn , might help in exploring the ( still obscure ) origin of the prompt emission .",
    "in fact , although we do not have an interpretation of the found @xmath3@xmath51 correlation , we believe it indicates that there should be some connection between the energy emitted by the burst and the emission process which determines its spectral properties .    the existence of the above correlation also allows to predict the jet break time , once the spectrum and the redshift of a burst are known . in the forthcoming swift era",
    "this might contribute in optimizing the grb follow up with planned observations at the expected jet break time .",
    "for this reason we think that it is important that the information about the peak energy be disseminated promptly together with the other fundamental grb properties such as the position , peak flux etc .",
    "now this routinely occurs for hete ii bursts , and it is crucial that this will happen also for the future swift bursts .",
    "berger et al . (",
    "2004a ) recently discussed the possibility that the real standard energy in cosmic explosions ( including grbs , xrfs and hypernovae ) is the total released kinetic energy rather than the fraction that goes into @xmath7-ray photons .",
    "this energy includes corrections due to mildly relativistic material ( estimated from radio emission such as in sn1998bw ; kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) and to a longer time - scale activity of the engine ( estimated from the afterglow lightcurve , such as in grb  030329 ) .",
    "while not in contrast with this idea , our findings underline the fact that the @xmath7-ray energetics is still an important parameter for understanding the physics of grbs .",
    "the found correlation implies that the peak energy of the spectrum , which is a quantity set by local micro ",
    "physical processes , is determined by a global property of the jet , namely its total @xmath7ray energy ( or the jet opening angle ) .",
    "last but not least , the @xmath3@xmath51 relation that we presented in this work and the low scatter of the sample of bursts with known redshifts around it strongly reminds a similar relation found for sn ia between their luminosity and the stretching factor of their optical light curve ( e.g. phillips 1993 , perlmutter et al . 1998 ) with less luminous supernovae showing a faster post  maximum light curve decay ( riess et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the proper modelling of this effect ( e.g. hamuy et al .",
    "1996 , perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ) allows to better determine the sn luminosity and consequently reduce the scatter in the hubble diagram with respect to the case that assumes that all sn ia are standard candles .",
    "similarly , our result shows that among grbs the existence of a correlation with small scatter between their peak spectral energy and the collimation corrected energy might be used to determine the different luminosities of different bursts .",

    "if our relation will be confirmed and possibly extended ( particularly to low peak energies ) with new bursts detected by swift , we might be able to test the cosmological models farther out the predicted snap sn limit of @xmath12=1.7 ( e.g aldering et al .",
    "this is particularly interesting since we might be able to explore an epoch in which the universe , matter dominated , was decelerating .",
    "we considered all the bursts with measured redshift and spectral peak energy up to now ( june 2004 ) .",
    "we systematically derived their source frame bolometric isotropic equivalent energy and , when available from the afterglow modeling ( 24/38 ) , corrected this energy for their collimation angle .",
    "we found a very tight correlation between the source frame @xmath3 ( the peak in the @xmath84 spectrum of the prompt emission ) and the collimation corrected emitted energy : @xmath85 kev .    *",
    "the small dispersion around this correlation is an indication of the robustness of the afterglow theory on which the estimate of the jet opening angle is based ( eq .  1 , sari et al .",
    "1999 ) * we found that , differently from previous results , grbs do not cluster around a unique value of their collimation corrected energy , but are spread in a relatively large range ( @xmath282 orders of magnitudes ) centered at @xmath866@xmath5410@xmath73 erg .",
    "we believe that the smaller spread found previously around a similar value @xmath285@xmath5410@xmath73 erg ( frail et al .",

    "2003 , panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) might be the result of a limited sample of grbs within a relatively small @xmath3 range .",
    "* the underlying physical motivation of the correlation is mysterious , but it is likely that it is the result of the radiation process producing the prompt emission which should be related to the local energy content of the burst .",
    "* there are relatively few bursts with @xmath87 kev , just the range of the bat instrument on - board swift , which therefore will be crucial for confirming or discarding the correlation . * finally , and more importantly , the correlation ( if the small scatter around it will be confirmed ) makes grbs exquisite cosmological tools , to measure @xmath88 , @xmath35 in a redshift range not accessible to supernovae ia , that is , @xmath89 , and up to any redshift . even if the optical information is unavailable for @xmath90 , the necessary information about the jet break time can be gathered by following the x ",

    "partial obscuration by dust , which can be an issue for using supernovae as standard candles , does not influence grbs .",
