    "our knowledge of neutron star masses @xcite is derived largely from three relativistic binary pulsars with eccentric orbits and probable neutron star companions @xcite .",
    "the masses of all known neutron stars exhibit a remarkably narrow scatter ( 0.04 ) about their mean of 1.35 .",
    "if one restricts attention to the neutron star pairs , the mean is 1.37 .",
    "these binary pulsars have also been pivotal in tests of the general theory of relativity ( taylor , fowler and mcculloch 1979 ) .",
    "gravitational waves have never been observed directly .",
    "our best quantitative evidence for their existence comes from observations of the binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 ( damour and taylor 1991 ) .",
    "this pulsar has a negative orbital period derivative that is consistent with the emission of gravity waves at the 0.4% level .",
    "unfortunately , the binary psr b1534 + 12 is so close to the earth that its proper motion induces a time - varying doppler term into the timing which prevents separation of the relativistic contribution to the orbital period derivative from the kinematic one @xcite .",
    "until an independent distance can be established , this pulsar s orbital period derivative can not verify the predictions of the theory to better than @xmath2% .",
    "nevertheless , measurement of psr b1534 + 12 s post - keplerian parameters have provided other tests of general relativity @xcite , and binary pulsars such as psr j04374715 have proved that the theory is consistently in agreement with the most precise observations @xcite .    discovered in the parkes multibeam survey",
    "is a 4.7@xmath3 binary pulsar with an eccentricity of 0.17 that consists of a 394 ms relatively youthful pulsar of characteristic age @xmath41.4 myr and an unidentified companion star .",
    "early observations @xcite of the periastron advance suggested a pulsar mass @xmath5 , and a companion @xmath6 .",
    "the observed tight distribution of neutron star masses near 1.35@xmath10.04 where the quoted error reflects a gaussian fit to the observed distribution , suggested that this system probably consisted of a @xmath7 1.3 neutron star and @xmath8 1 white dwarf companion .",
    "was therefore unique among the relativistic binary pulsars .",
    "its component masses argued for a white dwarf companion yet its orbit was highly eccentric making it the first of a new class of object .",
    "to date no white dwarf has been optically identified .",
    "is an exciting target for timing .",
    "firstly , scintillation observations have demonstrated a clear modulation of the timescale of the interstellar `` twinkling '' allowing derivation of the system s angle of inclination and runaway velocity ( ord , bailes and van straten 2002a ) .",
    "two degenerate fits to the changing scintillation timescale were possible .",
    "the observed distribution of neutron star masses favoured the solution with an inclination angle ( @xmath9 ) and center of mass velocity in the plane of the sky of @xmath10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "these results provide an independent estimate of the system orientation to be compared with the timing .",
    "secondly , neutral hydrogen observations ( ord , bailes and van straten 2002b ) have demonstrated that this pulsar is in a favourable location in the galaxy where the observed orbital period derivative will , as in the case of psr b1913 + 16 , be dominated by the general relativistic contribution .",
    "finally , contrary to psr b1913 + 16 , which is a very symmetric system with two neutron stars of nearly equal mass , is a very dissymmetric system as it comprises a strongly self - gravitating neutron star and a ( relatively ) weakly self - gravitating white dwarf .",
    "timing this system therefore tests new aspects of relativistic theories of gravity @xcite .    [",

    "observations of  were conducted from january 2001 until february 2003 at the parkes 64 m radio telescope as part of a scintillation study . the data from two orthogonal linear polarisations were detected and summed using a multi - channel filterbank consisting of 2@xmath12512@xmath120.5 mhz filters .",
    "these data were 1-bit sampled every 125 @xmath13s and written to magnetic tape for offline processing on the swinburne university of technology supercomputer .",
    "observations were usually greater than one orbit in duration , and there were ten sessions , nine of which took place in the 15 months prior to feb 2003 .",
    "the central observing frequency was 1390 mhz and total intensity pulse profiles were formed by folding the raw data at the topocentric period of the pulsar for integration times of 60s .",
    "a fit to the arrival times was made for the standard pulsar spin , astrometric , and keplerian terms as well as three post - keplerian parameters using a relativistic model ( damour and deruelle 1986 ) .",
    "after incorporation of archival timing data from the australia telescope national facility archives from july - august 1999 we found that our measurements of the periastron advance @xmath14 , transverse doppler and gravitational redshift , @xmath15 term , and orbital period derivative @xmath16 became much more significant .",
    "these values are displayed in table 1 .",
    "the archival data consisted mainly of data taken with a 2@xmath1296@xmath123 mhz filterbank system .",
    "we fit for a single arbitrary offset between the two datasets to allow for the change in instrumentation .",
    "newton s laws provide a relation between the system s masses and inclination angle @xmath17 , and the common observables orbital period @xmath18 and projected semi - major axis @xmath19 .",
    "this is often referred to as the pulsar mass function @xmath20 , @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the sum of the masses , @xmath23 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath24 is the speed of light . and refer to the mass of the pulsar and companion star respectively .",
    "general relativity allows us to use the post - keplerian terms to derive component masses .",
    "the advance of periastron gives us the sum of the masses .",
    "@xmath25 here @xmath26 is the orbital eccentricity .",
    "the combined transverse doppler and gravitational redshift term gives a different relation between the masses .",
    "@xmath27 general relativity predicts that gravitational wave emission from binary systems removes energy that results in an orbital decay .",
    "the system is over - determined if one can also measure the orbital period derivative @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 @xmath30 thus , binary pulsars such as can be used to test the validity of the general theory of relativity .",
    "the allowed range of masses for the system are shown in figure 1 .",
    "other post - keplerian parameters such as the range and shape of the shapiro delay were not significant in the fit .",
    "the companion is almost certainly a white dwarf , unless neutron star masses extend over a very large range .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the 7 neutron stars shown in figure 2 would place the companion of seven standard deviations from the mean of the others which appears unlikely .",
    "young pulsars often exhibit significant timing noise which make timing proper motions unreliable on the timescale of a few years .",
    "a formal fit to the limited data yielded proper motions in both right acension and declination of 12@xmath13 milli - arc seconds per year . whether the apparently 4-sigma proper motion is real or",
    "not will become apparent with continued timing .",
    "for now we are treating the result with some caution . timing noise",
    "has a much longer period ( months to years ) than the orbital period of our pulsar ( 4.7h ) , and so although the timing proper motion is potentially non - physical , the derived orbital parameters are not subject to contamination by timing noise .",
    "the self - consistency of the system with general relativity is very pleasing .",
    "the orbital period derivative is now a 4-sigma result .",
    "the relative error in this term scales as the length of the observing span @xmath31 , so by the end of the decade it should be near 1% .",
    "is therefore likely to be a very important new testing ground for general relativity .",
    "the dissymetry of the system tests different aspects of the theory since one of the stars is not strongly self - gravitating .",
    "its favourable location in the galaxy means that the measured orbital period derivative is close to the intrinsic value ( ord , bailes and van straten 2002a ) .",
    "unfortunately , the pulsar is young , and unlikely to be as intrinsically stable as psr b1913 + 16 , which has a much weaker magnetic field strength . whether this is important or not for post - keplerian orbital parameters remains to be seen . in any case",
    ", it will be difficult to surpass psr b1913 + 16 s relative errors on terms such as the relativistic contribution to the orbital period derivative .",
    "large - scale simulations of binary pulsar progenitors predict a large population of eccentric pulsar - white dwarf binaries @xcite , albeit with a short observable lifetime .",
    "is thought to arise from the evolution of a binary in which both stars are initially less than the critical mass required to produce a supernova @xcite .",
    "the initially more - massive star transfers mass to its companion before becoming a white dwarf .",
    "if sufficient matter can be accreted by the initially lower - mass star it will exceed and produce a pulsar .",
    "should the system remain bound , we will be left with a young neutron star orbiting a white dwarf companion in an eccentric orbit .",
    "s mass is therefore very important , because we know that the progenitor must have been less than 2  .",
    "this is the first time we have an upper limit to the progenitor mass of a neutron star , albeit in terms of .",
    "all previous neutron star mass measurements are from systems where both components were large enough to form neutron stars , which makes the progenitor masses far more difficult to constrain as our theoretical understanding of the mass of neutron star progenitors is limited .",
    "radio pulsar masses can not be easily determined .",
    "neutron stars can theoretically exist over a range of masses ( timmes , woosley and weaver 1996 ) that is much broader than that inferred from observations of radio pulsars ( weisberg and taylor 2003 , stairs et al.2002 , deich and kulkarni 1996 ) .",
    "until these measurements , the mean and standard deviation of the six accurately known neutron stars was just 1.37@xmath10.04 .",
    "s mass of 1.30@xmath10.02 is the smallest yet determined with any accuracy .",
    "it s mass is two standard deviations below the mean of the others as shown in figure 2 .      in the absence of any asymmetry in the explosion , component masses and orbital parameters define the progenitor system mass and runaway velocity @xcite .",
    "if the explosion were symmetric , the pre - supernova star in the system would have been only @xmath32 .",
    "it seems unlikely that the presupernova star could be such a small fraction of its original mass @xmath33 .",
    "thus s orbital configuration is therefore a strong argument in favour of asymmetric supernova kicks @xcite .",
    "such kicks can misalign the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors of the pulsar , allowing detectable precession due to spin orbit coupling@xcite .",
    "this has been observed in the binary pulsar psr 1913 + 16 @xcite . in the timescale for complete precession",
    "is only @xmath34 200 yr . its high orbital inclination could lead to significant changes in our line of sight to the pulsar s spin axis on the timescale of a decade or so .",
    "this might explain the non - detection of the pulsar in previous surveys of the region and we would expect rapid evolution of the pulse profile as suggested by @xcite",
    ".    is a very significant object .",
    "it has already validated scintillation speed methodologies , provided the first estimate of a neutron star mass where we have firm constraints on the progenitor , proved that mass transfer can transform a star that would otherwise become a white dwarf into a neutron star and extended the range of systems for which general relativity provides an accurate description .",
    "its orbital parameters suggest that the explosion was probably asymmetric . as the errors in orbital period derivative decrease",
    ", this system will test new aspects of theories of relativistic gravity that were impossible with the other relativistic binaries due to its unique composition @xcite .",
    "together , psr b1913 + 16 , psr b1534 + 12 and psr j11416545 will strongly constrain relativistic theories of gravity .                                                    * * acknowledgements + the parkes observatory is part of the australia telescope which is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro .",
