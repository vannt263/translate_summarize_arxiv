    "the advantage of quantum correlations in comparison with classical ones rises a fast development of quantum information and communication devices .",
    "however , the problem of identifying of quantum correlations in a given system is not resolved yet .",
    "first , the so - called quantum entanglement @xcite was considered as a proper measure of quantum correlations .",
    "later on , the quantum discord was accepted as a more adequate measure of quantum correlations @xcite . in particular",
    ", the states with zero entanglement can reveal non - zero discord .",
    "therefore it was noted @xcite that namely discord might be responsible for advantages of quantum information devices , in particular , for quantum speed - up . in general , the calculation of discord is very cumbersome optimization problem . in spite of intensive study of discord",
    "only very special cases have been treated analytically @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , namely these cases correspond to the reduced binary density matrix in spin-1/2 chains governed by different hamiltonians with either the thermal equilibrium initial state @xcite or the initial state with a single polarized node .",
    "a problem of a proper initial state is one of the fundamental problems in study of quntum correlations in different physical systems because of the technical difficulties of realization of a particular state .",
    "most popular is so - called thermal equilibrium initial state @xcite , which is most simple for realization .",
    "however , the initial state with a single exited node is more relative , for instance , in quantum communication lines @xcite .",
    "the state with a single polarized node has been produced experimentally @xcite .",
    "the evolution of quantum systems with this initial state at high temperatures has been studied , for instance , in @xcite , where the quantum echo has been found .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of identification of quantum correlations is not resolved yet . in particular",
    ", the measure of quantum correlations depends on the basis which is taken for the density matrix representation .",
    "the reason is that , considering different bases , we involve different types of  virtual particles  .",
    "a possible way to avoid this ambiguity is suggested in ref.@xcite , where the unitary invariant discord is introduced .",
    "this measure takes into account correlations among all possible  virtual particles  .    in this paper",
    "we consider the problem of preferable  virtual particles  ( or the preferable basis of the matrix representation ) from a different viewpoint . instead of collecting the correlations among all  virtual particles ",
    "( like in the unitary invariant discord @xcite ) we consider separately the quantum correlations among three types of particles , namely , among the fermions , which appear in a spin-1/2 system with the nearest neighbor interaction under the jourdan - wigner transformation @xcite ( we call them as the @xmath1-fermions ) , among the fermions which are the fourier representations of the @xmath1-fermions ( the @xmath2-fermions ) , and among the spin-1/2 particles in the basis of eigenvectors of the operators @xmath3 ( @xmath4-projection of the @xmath5th spin , @xmath8 ) .",
    "each type of particles corresponds to the proper basis of the density matrix representation .",
    "we show , that the choice of the basis is a significant ( may be even dominant ) factor in identification of quantum correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the evolution of the spin-1/2 open chain of @xmath0 nodes under the xy hamiltonian with the nearest neighbor interactions is derived in sec.[section : chain ] using the jourdan - wigner transformation .",
    "the general formulas for the discord and the concurrence are discussed in sec.[section : discord ] .",
    "the comparison of the discord and the concurrence in different bases of the density matrix representation is given in sec.[section : comparison ] .",
    "the summary of our results is represented in sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we study the quantum correlations in the one - dimensional open spin-1/2 chain of @xmath0 nodes governed by the xy hamiltonian in the approximation of nearest neighbor interactions , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the larmour frequency in the external magnetic field , @xmath11 is the spin - spin coupling constant between the nearest neighbors and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) is the @xmath15th spin projection on the @xmath16-axis .",
    "we chose the initial state of this chain with the single polarized @xmath5th node ( @xmath17 ) at arbitrary temperature , i.e. @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the plank constant , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath22 is the temperature of the system .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix is described by the liouville equation @xmath23 $ ] for the density matrix @xmath24 .",
    "the solution to this equation reads : @xmath25 to solve the liouville equation , we diagonalize the hamiltonian ( [ xy ] ) using the jordan - wigner transformation method @xcite @xmath26 where the fermion operators @xmath27 are defined in terms of other fermion operators @xmath28 by means of the fourier transformation @xmath29 and the fermion operators @xmath28 are defined as @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 it may be readily shown that the projection operators @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of the fermion operators @xmath28 as @xmath32 then the density matrix ( [ rho_t ] ) can be transformed to the following form @xcite @xmath33 where we use the identity @xmath34 it is interesting to note that the quantity @xmath35 for the @xmath36th node does not depend on @xmath1 and coincides with the result of ref.@xcite obtained for the high temperatures only ( @xmath37 for any operator @xmath38 ) : @xmath39    we will study the quantum discord @xmath40 and the concurrence @xmath41 ( as a measure of entanglement ) between any two particles . since @xmath42 and @xmath43 , hereafter we take @xmath44 without loss of generality , @xmath45 . as was mentioned in the introduction , we consider the open spin-1/2 chain using its density matrix representations in three different bases : ( i ) the basis of eigenvectors of the fermion operators @xmath27 ( we refer to this representation of the density matrix as the @xmath1-representation ) , ( ii ) the basis of eigenvectors of the fourier transformed fermion operators @xmath28 ( the @xmath2-representation of the density matrix ) , and ( iii ) the basis of eigenvectors of the operators @xmath3 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "of course , considering the correlations between the @xmath46th and the @xmath47th nodes in all these cases we consider the quantum correlations between physically different particles .",
    "thus , using either the @xmath1- or @xmath2-representation we consider the correlations either between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th @xmath1-fermions or between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th @xmath2-fermions , while using the basis of eigenvectors of the operators @xmath3 , we elaborate quantum correlations between the natural spin-1/2 particles .",
    "this is the reason of qualitative and quantitative difference among the discords and entanglements found in all these cases .",
    "first step in calculation of either discord or entanglement between the @xmath46th and @xmath47th nodes is the construction of the reduced density matrix with respect to all nodes except for the @xmath46th and @xmath47th ones .",

    "we write the density matrix as @xmath65 we use the superscript `` @xmath66 '' to specify the matrix representations of quantum operators in the basis of eigenvectors of the operators @xmath3 . reducing the density matrix @xmath24 with respect to all nodes except for the @xmath46th and @xmath47th ones",
    ", we obtain that the reduced density matrix is non - diagonal only if @xmath67 : @xmath68 otherwise ( @xmath69 ) the density matrix is diagonal : @xmath70 so that the discord and entanglement are both zero .",
    "the matrix form of the reduced density matrix @xmath71 in the basis ( [ basis ] ) coincides with eq.([rhonm_matr ] ) up to the replacements @xmath72 with @xmath73",
    "since the reduced bi - particle density matrices in all three cases have the same matrix form ( [ rhonm_matr ] ) , we derive the formulas for both the concurrence ( as a measure of entanglement ) and the discord for the density matrix ( [ rhonm_matr ] ) omitting the superscript @xmath1 .",

    "it might be readily demonstrated that the minimum in eq.([cl_min ] ) corresponds to @xmath112 .",
    "for this purpose we show that the derivative of the function @xmath113 with respect to the parameter @xmath110 is positive over the interval @xmath114 .",
    "in fact , this derivative reads after some transformations : @xmath115 rewrite eq.([der ] ) in the following form @xmath116 in our case @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",

    "the problem of description of those quantum correlations which are responsible for advantages of quantum computations is not resolved yet .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to characterize different types of quantum correlations in a quantum system , i.e. not only those which correspond to the real particles , but also correlations between the  virtual particles  .",

    "we investigate the quantum correlations in a spin-1/2 chain of @xmath0 nodes using three different matrix representations , i.e. we consider the same chain using ( i ) the @xmath1-representation introduced in sec.[section : bas1 ] , ( ii ) the @xmath2-representation introduced in sec.[section : bas2 ] , and ( iii ) the representation in the basis of eigenvectors of the operators @xmath3 , @xmath6 , discussed in sec.[section : bas3 ] .",
