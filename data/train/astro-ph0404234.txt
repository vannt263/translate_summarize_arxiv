    "the _ einstein _ observatory allowed for the discovery and study of x - ray emission from elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e.g. forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) , finding that the emission likely had two distinct contributors ( trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 , canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) .",
    "the softer emission is from hot interstellar gas ( forman et al 1985 , trinchieri , fabbiano , & canizares 1986 ) and dominates the total x - ray emission from the most massive ellipticals .",
    "observations with asca ( matsumoto et al . 1997 ) showed that a harder ( 5 - 10 kev ) spectral component scaled linearly with the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy , confirming its suggested origin as the unresolved contributions of numerous low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ; white , nagase , & parmar 1995 ; irwin & sarazin 1998 ) .",
    "the exquisite point source sensitivity of _ chandra _ led to the discoveries of the expected lmxbs ( e.g. sarazin , irwin & bregman 2000 ; blanton , sarazin & irwin 2000 ; sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2001 ; finoguenov & jones 2001 ; angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky 2001 ; kraft et al .",
    "2001 ; kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ; di stefano et al . 2003 ; randall , sarazin & irwin 2004 ) . these observations ( see gilfanov 2004 and kim & fabbiano 2004 ) typically find 20 - 50 lmxbs with @xmath10 from elliptical galaxies with stellar masses of @xmath11 .",
    "this has provided a large sample of very bright lmxbs that is unattainable from the milky way or even m31 , allowing for a new probe of binary evolution .",
    "gilfanov ( 2004 ) showed that the lmxbs of these elliptical and s0 galaxies are consistent with a single luminosity function @xmath12 from @xmath13 to a break value @xmath14 . with @xmath15 .",
    "kim and fabbiano ( 2004 ) recently found a similar result for @xmath16 of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath19 , the luminosity function steepens to @xmath20 .",
    "the total number of x - ray sources scales with the galactic mass , with @xmath21 sources of @xmath22 per @xmath23 ( gilfanov 2004 ) , or a total x - ray luminosity that scales linearly with the @xmath24 band luminosity as @xmath25 for @xmath26 ( kim & fabbiano 2004 ) .    starting with the original observation of ngc 4697 ( sarazin et al .",
    "2001 ) , it has become clear that many ( 20 - 70% ) of these lmxbs are residing in globular clusters ( angelini et al . 2001 ; kundu et al . 2002 ; maccarone , kundu & zepf 2003 ; minnitti et al .",
    "kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that there was no difference in @xmath27 for lmxbs in and out of gcs ( both had @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) in ngc 4472 , supporting the suggestion of white , sarazin and kulkarni ( 2002 ) that most of the bright lmxbs in ellipticals are made in gcs .",
    "kundu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) showed that nearly 4% of ngc 4472 gcs host a bright lmxb , with metal rich clusters about 3 times more likely to host an lmxb ( confirmed in ngc 4365 and ngc 3115 by kundu et .",
    "al . 2003 ) .",
    "sarazin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied four galaxies and found that the specific incidence of lmxbs in gcs is about one source with @xmath30 per @xmath31 , so that a star in a gc is about 1000 times more likely to be a donor than a star in the field .",
    "such a large enhancement of the incidence of lmxbs in gcs was first found in the milky way ( katz 1975 ; clark 1975 ) and is indicative of the important role of interactions in creating mass transferring binaries in gcs ( see hut et al .",
    "1992 for an overview ) .",
    "though numerous lmxbs have been found , the nature of the donor star in this old stellar population remains a mystery .",
    "piro & bildsten ( 2002 ) showed that for field lmxbs , the simplest way to reach @xmath32 ( or @xmath33 yr@xmath2 for accretion onto a neutron star of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) is to have a red giant branch star fill the roche lobe with orbital periods of days or longer .",
    "they noted that these wide binaries are nearly always transient accretors , and that multiple _",
    "chandra _ observations would easily identify them ( e.g. kraft et al . 2001 ) .",
    "however , calculating the resulting @xmath27 is impossible given our poor state of knowledge of the transient duty cycle .",
    "we argue here that the most likely type of mass transferring binary responsible for the bright end of the luminosity function in distant elliptical galaxies ( especially those in gcs ) are `` ultracompact '' systems consisting of either a he or c / o white dwarf donor of mass @xmath36 which is filling its roche lobe in a 5 - 10 minute orbit with a neutron star . in  2 , we summarize the observational clues that led us to this conjecture and derive the resulting @xmath27 , showing that the observed power law is naturally explained . in  3 , we use the observed normalizations from _ chandra _ to compare to the predicted formation rate of ultracompacts in gcs from dynamical interactions .",
    "we also predict the expected number of millisecond radio pulsars ( msps ) assuming that all ultracompacts become msps .",
    "we close in  4 by noting more observational tests , and discussing future work .",
    "there are a number of facts that support our conjecture .",
    "the first is that the brightest lmxb in a galactic gc ( see table 1 in deutsch , margon & anderson 2000 ) and the only one with a luminosity comparable to that detected in a distant elliptical is the @xmath37 source 4u  1820 - 30 in ngc 6624 .",
    "stella , priedhorsky & white ( 1987 ) found a coherent 11.4 minute periodicity in 4u1820 - 30 with a peak to peak variation in the x - rays of @xmath38% , which is now securely identified as the orbital period ( van der klis et al .",
    "the observed properties of the thermonuclear flashes from this system are best explained by accretion of nearly pure helium ( e.g. bildsten 1995 ; strohmayer & brown 2002 ; cumming 2003 ) .",
    "the second clue is that the observed luminosity break , @xmath39 , is much closer to the eddington limit of a neutron star ( ns ) accreting material with two baryons per electron ( e.g. he or c / o ) @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the thomson scattering cross section ) than accretion of cosmic composition this has been noted previously ( e.g. kim and fabbiano 2004 ) but none made the connection to ultracompacts .",
    "the last fact is that ultracompact progenitors ( i.e. a ns and white dwarf in a few hour orbit ) are vigorously produced in gcs ( verbunt 1987 ; davies 1995 ; rasio , pfahl and rappaport 2000 ) .",
    "verbunt ( 1987 ) noted that one way to form these systems is a direct stellar collision of a ns with a red giant that would trigger a common envelope ( ce ) event ( though simulations of rasio and shapiro 1991 found no common envelope ) .",
    "the ce would allow for inspiral of the ns and red giant he core ( of mass @xmath42 ) to short enough orbital periods that gravitational wave losses drive it into contact within a hubble time and initiate mass transfer .",
    "rasio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that a much more likely formation channel is an exchange interaction of the ns with a primordial binary ( e.g. hut , murphy & verbunt 1991 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) when the gc was young .",
    "the higher main sequence turnoff mass would then trigger unstable mass transfer and a ce event and inspiral of the he core when the star leaves the main sequence .",
    "some systems formed this way could also be ejected from the gc and appear as lmxbs at a later date when the gravitational radiation losses have driven them into contact .    at these very short orbital periods ( 1 - 10 minutes ) , @xmath4 is set by the rate of angular momentum loss from gravitational radiation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the orbital separation . under the constraint of conservative mass transfer and roche lobe filling , @xmath45 , @xmath4 relates to the angular momentum loss rate as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the rate of change of the wd radius under mass loss .",
    "bildsten ( 2002 ) and deloye and bildsten ( 2003 ; hereafter db ) calculated the impact of finite entropy on the value of @xmath48 , which is most pronounced at longer orbital periods where the donor is even less massive , @xmath49",
    ". however , the composition of the wd does matter , as coulomb physics makes the c or o donors more compact than he donors at a given mass and modifies @xmath48 , allowing it to range from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the relations between @xmath52 , @xmath48 and orbital period as a function of the accretion luminosity , @xmath53 , found by integrating equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with the wd models of db and an initial ns mass of @xmath34 .",
    "this shows that the companion masses required ( @xmath54 ) to reach @xmath55 are consistent with the evolution of a system with an initial wd donor mass of @xmath56 .",
    "we plot the evolution here during the @xmath57 stage and attribute the observed cutoff in @xmath27 to either the impact of super - eddington accretion or ( as noted below ) a predominance of ultracompact progenitors with @xmath58 he cores .",
    "we see no reason to attribute the @xmath59 sources to accretion onto black holes and think it most likely that these sources are ultracompacts accreting via a disk at a super - eddington rate .",
    "_ the best confirmation of our conjecture would be the discovery of the orbital periodicity in the range of figure 1 . _",
    "ultracompacts evolve through the observable @xmath53 range in @xmath60 years , a timescale much shorter than either the age of the gcs or any reasonable expectations of a timescale over which the birthrate of mass - transferring systems might change . hence , their total number is indicative of their current birthrate and we can demand continuity within the accreting population to directly calculate @xmath27 .",
    "we start by combining the evolution equations to yield a simple analytic form for @xmath61 where @xmath62 in the limit of @xmath63 . for @xmath64 ,",
    "this gives @xmath65 . integrating this equation ( and setting @xmath48 and",
    "@xmath66 constant ) yields @xmath52 as a function of time , @xmath67 , since the onset of mass transfer , @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the initial wd donor mass set by the progenitor scenario , which can range from @xmath70 for he cores to @xmath71 for c / o cores .    in the limit that @xmath72",
    ", we get the simple relation @xmath73 .",
    "the amount of time the binary spends with a luminosity in excess of @xmath53 is @xmath74 , which immediately yields @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting value of @xmath76 ( in equation 1 ) is then @xmath77 or @xmath78 for @xmath79 , in excellent agreement with the observed values of @xmath15 ( gilfanov 2004 ) and @xmath80 ( kim and fabbiano 2004 ) . clearly , there is little difference in @xmath76 for the range of @xmath48 expected from varied compositions .",
    "the power law steepens for @xmath52 close to @xmath69 , which could explain the observed break at @xmath39 if nearly all of the ultracompact progenitors had @xmath81 .",
    "this mass is the he core mass at the turnoff , but we know of no dynamical calculations that point to such a narrow @xmath69 distribution .",
    "most importantly , we have shown that the luminosity function slope is nearly independent of both the age of the gc and the type of initial wd donor ( i.e. he or c / o ) .",
    "this universality and remarkable agreement with the observations allows us to use the _ chandra _ derived incidence of lmxbs to calculate the ultracompact birthrates and the total number of such systems made over a hubble time .",
    "the identification of elliptical lmxbs with ultracompact binaries has broad repercussions .",
    "the simplest one to state is that the much smaller donor mass ( compared to main sequence donors ) naturally shortens the lmxb lifetimes and dramatically increases the implied lmxb birthrate . in their study of",
    "four elliptical galaxies , sarazin et al ( 2003 ) found a specific lmxb incidence within gcs of @xmath82 source with @xmath30 per @xmath31 , consistent with the @xmath83 found by kundu et al .",
    "this incidence is independent of gc mass , but dependent on gc metallicity ( kundu et al .",
    "an ultracompact at @xmath84 has @xmath85 , a he donor of @xmath86 and an age of @xmath87 years , implying an _ ultracompact birthrate of one new bright lmxb every @xmath87 years in a @xmath9 gc .",
    "_    kundu et al.s ( 2003 ) preliminary study found that the incidence of bright lmxbs is consistent with being independent of gc age over the range of 3 - 11 gyr , allowing us to integrate the birthrate over 8 gyr to obtain @xmath8 wd - ns binaries capable of undergoing stable mass transfer in a @xmath9 cluster .",
    "davies ( 1995 ) calculations found 5 - 50 wd - ns binaries that will make contact within 10 gyrs per 1000 initial binaries .",
    "if the initial binary fraction was @xmath88 , then the observed rate is consistent with davies ( 1995 ) lower estimate .",
    "ivanova and rasio ( 2004 ) found @xmath89 wd - ns capable of making contact ( with a roughly constant rate in time , see rappaport et .",
    "2001 for a declining rate in time ) during the evolution of a cluster model with a core density of @xmath90 ( similar to 47 tuc ) and a total mass after a hubble time of @xmath91 ; a factor of three less than implied by the _ chandra _ observations and our identification with ultracompacts .",
    "future comparisons must take into account the initial wd mass and its impact on the binary s fate once contact is established ( i.e. merging versus stable mass transfer ) .",
    "we can also check our hypothesis by comparing these total numbers to the supposed endpoints of the mass transfer , a recycled msp either in a tight binary ( rasio et al .",
    "2000 ) or isolated ( see bildsten s ( 2002 ) discussion of the likelihood of this ) .",
    "kulkarni , narayan and romani ( 1990 ) calculated that the msp birthrate in all galactic gcs ( @xmath92 ) was @xmath93 every @xmath94 years for a total number of gc msps of @xmath95 .",
    "assuming that the x - ray lifetimes of the gc lmxbs was @xmath96 years ( consistent with mass transfer on the main sequence , but likely inconsistent with the lifetime implied by the calculated formation rate ; hut , murphy & verbunt 1991 ) and using the @xmath97 persistent sources , they found a gc lmxb birthrate of one every @xmath98 years .",
    "they noted that a factor of 100 reduction in the x - ray lifetime was needed to alleviate the discrepancy with the msp birthrate .",
    "in retrospect , it is clear that the gc lmxb birthrate is completely dominated by the highest @xmath4 source , the ultracompact 4u  1820 - 30 with an age of @xmath99 years . though the numbers are small , its mere existence gives a gc lmxb birthrate a factor of 100 higher . rather than",
    "depend on 4u  1820 - 30 to derive the rate , if we use the rate found in elliptical gcs , then there should be @xmath100 msps in all of the galactic gc s , consistent with kulkarni et al.s ( 1990 ) estimate .",
    "finally , we compare the expectations from the ultracompact formation rate with the msp population in the galactic gc 47 tuc .",
    "the discovery of 20 msps in 47 tuc ( camilo et al . 2000 ) led camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to speculate that there might be as many as 200 msps in this @xmath101 cluster .",
    "later x - ray observations ( grindlay et al . 2002 ; edmonds et al .",
    "2003 ) bring this number down to 100 ( camilo , f. , priv .",
    "the implied rate from ellipticals would yield @xmath102 msps , just slightly high .",
    "our identification of these distant lmxbs with ultracompact binaries naturally explains the observed luminosity function from _ chandra _ observations and yields the lmxb birthrate of one new mass transferring binary every @xmath87 years per @xmath9 of gcs .",
    "rather remarkably , this derived birthrate from distant ellipticals agrees with both dynamical calculations ( e.g. ivanova & rasio 2004 ) and the observed number of msps in galactic gcs , especially 47 tuc .",
    "the much lower donor mass ( @xmath103 ) has alleviated the `` birthrate '' problem often discussed for lmxbs and msps in galactic gcs ( e.g. kulkarni et al .",
    "1990 ) .    the simplest way to prove this hypothesis is to find the 5 - 10 minute orbital periods .",
    "if we use 4u  1820 - 30 as our example , the level of orbital variability in the x - rays could be as low as a few percent , allowing for _ chandra _ searches amongst the few bright lmxbs in m31 gcs while _ xmm - newton _ could probe much deeper . the source",
    "4u  1820 - 30 cycles in luminosity by about a factor of 3 over a 171 day cycle for unknown reasons ( chou & grindlay 2001 ) . such variability is easily detected by _",
    "chandra _ , and",
    "indeed variability at this level has been reported for bright lmxbs in m31 ( e.g. trudolyubov & priedhorsky 2004 ) . however , attributing such behavior as unique to ultracompacts is much harder .",
    "ultraviolet observations of 4u  1820 - 30 ( king et al 1993 ; arons and king 1993 ) confirmed the 11.4 minute orbit and similar work could be done with _ hst _ amongst the bright systems in m31 .",
    "the lower luminosities that are visible in the gc sources in our galaxy and in m31 have yet to be probed by _",
    "chandra _ in distant ellipticals . for ultracompact binaries ,",
    "the expectation is that our derived @xmath27 will continue until a @xmath53 is reached where the systems become transients ( presuming no dramatic episode associated with msp turn - on ) .",
    "db showed that in the absence of x - ray heating in the outer disk , this would occur at @xmath104 , whereas with x - ray heating , the disks can remain stable down to much lower x - ray luminosities .",
    "unfortunately , the current populations of ultracompacts in our galaxy do nt provide a stringent test of which case is correct .",
    "_ chandra _ may be able to identify this cutoff with deeper observations of nearby ellipticals .",
    "there is still much to explain .",
    "clearly , not all bright lmxbs are ultracompact binaries , both because the msps in wide binaries with he wds ( orbital periods longer than a day ) can not be made from ultracompacts and because roughly half the galactic gc sources are clearly hydrogen accretors ( kuulkers et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , the strong expectation is that most of the h donors with @xmath53 large enough to detect at 10 mpc are transient accretors ( e.g. piro & bildsten 2002 ) , making secure predictions of @xmath27 difficult .",
    "observations of the bright lmxbs in m31 ( di stefano et al .",
    "2002 ; trudolyubov & priedhorsky 2004 ) have motivated a stable mass transfer scenario involving thermal timescale mass transfer from evolved stars ( di stefano et al .",
    "2002 ) , but @xmath27 was not derived .",
    "we have also not explained the higher incidence of bright lmxbs in metal - rich gcs ( kundu et al .",
