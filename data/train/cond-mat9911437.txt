    "long josephson junctions are known as the most clean systems to experimentally study basic properties of josephson vortices , often also called fluxons.@xcite the interaction of a josephson vortex with a potential induced by an externally applied magnetic field has been discussed in literature in various contexts.@xcite recently , first measurements reporting the thermally activated escape of the vortex from a magnetic field - induced potential well at @xmath0 have been reported.@xcite experiments probing the quantum properties of a josephson vortex trapped in a field - engineered potential are currently in progress .",
    "our interest in this subject is related to a possibility of using macroscopic quantum states of josephson vortices for quantum computation@xcite .",
    "we suggest that two distinct states of a fluxon trapped in a field - controlled double - well potential inside a narrow long junction can be used for designing a qubit , the basic unit of information in a quantum computer .",
    "we propose that by varying the external magnetic field and junction shape one is able to form an arbitrary - shaped potential for a fluxon in a junction ; the amplitude of this potential can be varied in experiment by tuning the magnetic field .",
    "in this paper we present our experimental results on the thermal escape of a fluxon from a potential well measured at different temperatures .",
    "we also discuss the quantum tunneling of a fluxon and some preliminary ideas on the engineering of a double - well potential for a fluxon .",
    "we consider a long josephson junction of arbitrary shape and constant width @xmath1 . if @xmath1 is smaller than the josephson penetration depth @xmath2 the junction can be considered as quasi - one dimensional .",

    "( [ eq : sinegordon ] ) contains the perturbation terms .",
    "the term @xmath7 is the bias current normalized to the critical current , the damping term due to the quasiparticle resistance @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the term @xmath10 describes the interaction of the josephson vortex with a spatial inhomogeneity region in the junction . in absence of perturbations the josephson vortex",

    "the force acting on the vortex can be expressed in terms of the potential @xmath17 .",
    "the bias current through the junction acts as a driving force ( of the lorentz type ) on the vortex .",
    "the pinning force may have different physical origins .",
    "a pinning center for a josephson vortex in a long junction can be realized by introducing a micro - short@xcite or a micro - resistor@xcite in the junction barrier .",
    "pinning may also occur due to the interaction of the vortex with the junction leads@xcite or interaction with parasitic magnetic flux trapped in the superconducting films .",
    "alternatively , a vortex can be pinned by its magnetic dipole interaction with an external magnetic field.@xcite in the following , we consider the latter pinning induced by an external magnetic field , because this method allows to _ control _ the pinning potential for the vortex during the experiment .",
    "the interaction of a josephson vortex with an external magnetic field applied in the plane of an annular junction can be taken into account by the perturbation term@xcite @xmath18 in eq .",

    "[ fig : exp ] , the fluxon has the lowest energy in the location where @xmath29 is directed along @xmath30 and the highest energy in the diametrically opposite location where @xmath29 is opposite to @xmath30 .",
    "the pinning potential for the vortex becomes @xmath31 .",
    "subject to a driving force mediated by the bias current @xmath32 , the potential is tilted proportionally to @xmath32 , effectively lowering the potential barrier for the fluxon .",
    "thus , the fluxon dynamics in an annular junction placed in a magnetic field is analogous to the motion of a particle in a tilted wash - board potential and can be mapped to the dynamics of the phase in a small josephson junction.@xcite",
    "at high enough temperatures , a josephson vortex trapped in a potential well can escape from the well by a thermally activated process .",

    "the activation of a vortex from a potential well can be determined experimentally by measuring the switching current distribution of the josephson junction.@xcite in this type of measurement , the probability of the vortex escape from a pinned state ( no dc voltage drop across the junction ) to a propagating state ( dc voltage drop proportional to the average vortex velocity ) is determined in dependence on the bias current .",
    "the experimentally observed critical current distribution @xmath38 is to be compared with a theoretical prediction @xmath39 which is calculated from the bias current sweep rate @xmath40 and the dependence of the activation rate @xmath41 on the bias current @xmath32 . if the escape of the vortex is due to a thermally activated process , i.e. when @xmath42 , the critical current distribution @xmath38 is determined by eq .",

    "a single josephson vortex could be trapped in the junction by applying a small bias current through the junction during the transition from the normal to the superconducting state .",

    "( [ eq : probdistribution ] ) the activation rate @xmath51 can be determined from the experimental data . using a cubic approximation of the potential eq .",

    "[ fig:13pi ] .    from a linear fit to @xmath52 , both the effective temperature @xmath53 of the thermal escape and the critical current in the absence of fluctuations @xmath54 can be determined self - consistently .",

    "the experimentally determined values of @xmath53 are within @xmath58 of the thermal bath temperatures @xmath59 for all values of the magnetic field . for the lowest temperature ,",
    "the fitted escape temperature is notably higher than the bath temperature , which is due to the limited current resolution of approximately @xmath60 in the @xmath61 range of the measurement setup used for data acquisition in this particular experiment .",
    "moreover , a small but systematic increase of the escape temperature for small magnetic fields is observed .",
    "this effect may be explained by considering a localized and magnetic field independent contribution to the pinning potential@xcite , which leads to an enhanced activation rate at low fields . in fig .",
    "[ fig:13tesc]b , the magnetic field dependence of the fluctuation - free critical currents @xmath62 is plotted .",
    "the currents are observed to be larger than the critical currents measured in the @xmath63 patterns , as expected .",
    "in the limit of @xmath64 , the thermal activation of the vortex from the potential well is exponentially suppressed and eventually the temperature independent contribution due to quantum tunneling of the vortex through the potential barrier will be the dominating escape process . by measuring the switching current distribution",
    "we expect to observe a crossover from thermal activation to quantum escape at low temperatures .",
    "experiments aiming to observe this effect are currently in preparation .",
    "the theory of macroscopic quantum tunneling for a single josephson vortex has been recently developed and discussed in detail in refs .  .",
    "essentially , the quantum tunneling of the vortex can be described in the caldeira- leggett approach@xcite , where the escape rate is given by @xmath65 with @xmath66 this analysis is valid for an expansion of the potential @xmath67 up to third order in the vortex coordinate @xmath68 .",
    "our numerical and analytical calculations of the expected switching current distributions ( [ eq : probdistribution ] ) using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : thermalescape],[eq : wkbrate ] ) show that a cross - over from thermal activation to quantum tunneling can be expected at temperatures @xmath69 for junctions which are several micron wide . in these calculations we took into account the effects of dissipation which can be modeled using the effective damping parameter @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coeffb ] ) .",
    "we considered both the quasiparticle tunneling across the junction barrier and the quasiparticle impedance of the electrodes as possible origins of dissipation ( also see ref .  ) . at @xmath0",
    "the damping parameter @xmath9 is typically @xmath70 and decreases exponentially with temperature .",
    "therefore , this damping mechanism does not substantially decrease the cross - over temperature . in ref .",
    ", the dissipation induced by the interaction of the vortex with plasma waves is studied , and the resulting decrease of the tunneling rate is found to be small .",
    "so far no other interaction mechanisms of the system with the environment have been taken into account .",
    "our calculations show that the cross - over temperature can be increased close to @xmath71 , by reducing the junction width down to sub - micron size and optimizing the junction electrical properties .",
    "most experiments on fluxon dynamics conducted so far have been done using long josephson junctions of width @xmath72 .",
    "this limit is imposed by the standard photolithographic preparation procedure .",
    "recently , we succeeded to fabricate high quality ultra - narrow long josephson junctions based on niobium - aluminum - oxide trilayer technology of width down to less than @xmath73.@xcite in this procedure , we are using electron - beam lithography for junction definition and cross - linked pmma for junction insulation.@xcite we have successfully prepared and characterized narrow long junctions of different geometries . a photograph of a @xmath74 wide heart - shaped long josephson junction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heart]a .",
    "first experiments on the activation of fluxons from magnetic field - induced potentials in @xmath75 wide annular junctions have been recently performed and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "since the interaction energy of the vortex with the external magnetic field is determined by the shape of the junction according to ( [ eq : magfieldpotential ] ) , it is possible to design an experiment with , in principle , arbitrarily shaped fluxon potential by simply varying the junction geometry .",
    "since the major goal in our experiments with quantum fluxons will be a demonstration of macroscopic quantum coherence , one needs to realize a double - well potential for a vortex in the junction .",
    "we suggest to use a heart - shaped josephson junction , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : heart]a .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath30 applied along the symmetry axis in the junction plane forms two equal potential wells for the fluxon at locations `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' . at these two positions",
    "the fluxon magnetic moment @xmath29 is directed along @xmath30 , see fig  [ fig : heart]b .",
    "the barrier height between the wells can be conveniently controlled by the field amplitude and its angle with the symmetry axis of the junction . the corresponding potential profile at @xmath76 , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfieldpotential ] ) with the normalized junction length @xmath77 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pot ] in units of @xmath78 .",
    "we note that there are constraints on the potentials that can be generated by changing the junction shape , because the shape dependent part of the potential is effectively averaged over the vortex size ( @xmath79 ) , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : magfieldpotential ] ) . in the limit of @xmath80",
    "all features of the potential disappear .    in the quantum limit , the two distinct fluxon states in the double well potential may be employed as a degenerate two - state system . under sufficient decoupling from the environment and provided that the temperature and dissipation in the junction are low enough , the superposition of the macroscopically distinct quantum states `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' is expected to be observed .",
    "the preparation of the initial state for a quantum coherence measurement may be achieved by turning the magnetic field in the plane of the junction , and the final state of the vortex can be read out by performing an escape measurement from one of the potential wells .",
    "we have considered a vortex in a long josephson junction interacting with an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "experiments indicating the thermal activation of the vortex from the field - induced potential have been successfully performed . moreover , the prospects of observing quantum tunneling of a single vortex from such a potential are discussed as well as possibilities of potential engineering in order to form a double - well potential for use in a qubit .",
