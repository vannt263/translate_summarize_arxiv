    "the physics of holes moving in a background build up from a great number of electrons has received much attention in the last decade given by the connection of this problem with main questions arising from the study of strongly correlated systems ( chernyshev and leung 1999 ) .",
    "developments in several fields underline this aspect : behaviour in antiferromagnetic background ( anderson 1997 ) , metal - insulator transition ( trugman 1990 a ) , doping effects ( loius _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , ferromagnetism ( kollar _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , high @xmath4 superconductivity ( trugman 1998 ) , colossal magnetoresistance ( ishihara _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , spiral states ( watanabe and miyashita 1999 ) , generalized - statistics ( long and zotos 1992 ) , pairing mechanism and bound - states ( trugman 1990 b ) , polaronic effects ( louis _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) , are main examples to be mentioned . from the theoretical side",
    "the hubbard type models are especially involved in the theoretical description starting from infinite on - site repulsion ( nagaoka 1966 ) , finite hubbard interaction ( stt 1991 ) , and continuing with the inclusion of spin - independent interactions ( tasaki 1989 ) , extensively extended versions ( kollar _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , degenerated orbitals ( shen and wang 1999 ) and limiting cases like the @xmath5 model in one - band ( chernyshev and leung 1999 ) , or multi - band versions ( shen and wang 1999 ) .",
    "the theoretical descriptions started with the 1-hole problem discussed by nagaoka ( nagaoka 1966 ) , which has been continued with two - holes studies ( kuzmin 1993 ) , and many - hole analyses in various configurations and circumstances ( mattis 1986 , doucot and wen 1989 , barbieri @xmath6 1990 , tth 1991 , tian 1991 ) . despite the huge intellectual effort spent in the field exact results related to the mentioned problem",
    "are extremely rare ( mattis 1986 ) and concern only the 1-hole nagaoka - state ( nagaoka 1966 ) and its possible extensions ( tasaki 1989 , stt 1991 , tth 1991 ) . however , in the above enumerated concrete applications mostly multi - hole descriptions are needed mainly in strong - coupling limit .",
    "these situations have been treated in the literature based on various approximations ( acceptable in restricted conditions ) like complete separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom ( kuzmin 1993 ) , extended gutzwiller wave - functions ( gebhard and zotos 1991 ) , canonical transformations ( chernyshev _ et al . _",
    "cond - mat 9806018 ) , generalization of 1d results to higher dimensions ( doucot and wen 1989 ) , restrictions related to the number of holes ( barbieri @xmath6 1990 ) , unrestricted hartree - fock ( loius _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , etc . , or numerical procedures like exact diagonalization on small clusters ( takahashi 1982 ) , and diagonalization within a retained portion of the hilbert space ( trugman 1998 ) .",
    "we witnessed also studies on specific problems like ferromagnetism ( vollhardt _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) .    on the background of the mentioned large spectrum of description attempts , in this paper we are presenting an unifying aspect of the hole - motion in the simple one - band hubbard model in the limit of infinitely large on - site repulsion @xmath7 . for this reason",
    "first of all we have deduced and presented an exact and explicit schrdinger equation for an arbitrary number of holes in the analyzed model .",
    "this equation clearly underlines the role played by the charge and spin degrees of freedom during the movement of the holes in the @xmath8 hubbard model , being mathematically based on the representations of the symmetric group @xmath0 of degree @xmath9 , where @xmath9 represents the number of electrons within the system .",
    "advantages of the presented description are underlined by the observations that : a ) the emerging matrix elements can be find ( or deduced in case of larger systems ) from standard textbooks of the group theory , and b ) the analysis reduced the concrete equation to be solved in subspaces fixed by a given , but arbitrary total system spin @xmath10 of the initial large hilbert space , allowing comfortable numerical applications .    after this step , and concrete applications of the deduced equation related to the @xmath11 spectrum and physical properties of small samples",
    ", we turn on the study of @xmath12 properties by showing how the presented formalism helps the deduction of the partition function @xmath13 based on the characters of the representations of the symmetric group ( again accessible from standard text - books in group theory ) .",
    "the emerging coefficients in @xmath13 can be reduced to coefficients easily obtainable from numerical methods , being related to the number of different loops with fixed length that can be drawn in the studied system connecting its lattice sites .",
    "the procedure is able even to increase the efficiency of the usual monte carlo simulation methods .",
    "starting from the deduced formulas , we are presenting some examples of the @xmath12 behaviour of the two - hole case .",
    "our results clearly underline that in the infinitely repulsive hubbard model the movement of holes is intimately influenced by the spin - background of the electrons . as a consequence , in describing this process in the general case",
    ", the charge and spin degrees of freedom can not be entirely separated .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii . describes the studied model and introduces the used notations , sec .",
    "iii . presents the basis of the hilbert space used during the paper , sec .",
    "iv . describes the action of the hamiltonian on the basis vectors , sec .",
    "v. presents the deduced schrdinger equation together with applications , sec .",
    "concentrates on @xmath14 properties and emphasises the advantages of the presented formalism in deducing thermodynamic quantities like partition function , thermodynamic potential , specific heat , expectation value of the total spin , sec .",
    "presents a summary of the paper , and an appendix containing the mathematical details closes the presentation .",
    "our starting hamiltonian ( @xmath15 ) describes the one - band hubbard model in @xmath1 limit .",
    "given by the absence of doubly occupied sites in the lattice , @xmath15 becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 are hopping matrix elements for nearest neighbour sites ( otherwise @xmath18 ) .",
    "the operators @xmath19 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath20 at lattice site @xmath21 , and @xmath22 represents particle number operator .",
    "the double occupancy is projected out by @xmath23 . for convenience ,",
    "we denote the lattice by @xmath24 , the number of the lattice sites by @xmath25 , the number of electrons by @xmath9 , so the number of holes becomes @xmath26 .",
    "being also interested in magnetic properties , we present below the notations and definitions related to spin characteristics .",
    "the total spin operator is taken as @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the pauli matrices .",
    "furthermore we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the eigenvalue of @xmath32 and by @xmath33 the eigenvalue of @xmath34 . the quantity @xmath10 represents the total spin of the state described .",
    "now we prepare a basis for a sector of the hilbert space of the system with a fixed @xmath35 number of holes and a given @xmath31 projection of the total spin .",
    "we start from hilbert space vectors characterized by the position of holes @xmath36 , and the spin configuration of the electrons situated in single occupied states @xmath37 , defined as @xmath38 where the product is taken over all the occupied sites in @xmath24 , and @xmath39 represents the bare vacuum with no fermions present . for mathematical convenience ,",
    "we introduce the convention that the elements of @xmath24 are building up an ordered set ( i.e. the lattice sites are numbered ) and the product in eq.([eq1 ] ) follows this order . as a consequence , the product of creation operators from eq.([eq1 ] ) is written in increasing order with respect to lattice indices .",
    "let us introduce now the function @xmath40 that performs a regroupation of lattice site positions , maintaining however their initial numbering . by definition",
    ", @xmath41 gives the indices of occupied lattice sites in increasing order for the first @xmath9 numbers in the @xmath42 set , and introduces the indices of the empty sites in arbitrary order for the last @xmath35 positions of the mentioned set ( we underline , @xmath43 ) .",
    "the numbering of hole positions obtained after the action of @xmath41 being arbitrary , @xmath41 itself is not uniquely defined . using it",
    ", @xmath44 becomes @xmath45    in order to describe the spin configuration with a fixed @xmath31 projection of the total spin , we observe that @xmath31 can be characterized by permutations @xmath46 of the symmetric group of degree @xmath9 . indeed , the set @xmath47 represents in fact a permutation of @xmath48 symbols @xmath49 and @xmath50 symbols @xmath51 ( see appendix ) . using @xmath52 , the spin configuration can be denoted as @xmath53 , where the function @xmath20 defined by @xmath54 if @xmath55 and @xmath56 if @xmath57 . with the introduced notations",
    "the basis vectors of the hilbert space with fixed number of holes @xmath35 and fixed total spin projection @xmath31 can be written as @xmath58 the subspaces generated by vectors @xmath59 with different @xmath41 are different but isomorphic parts of the whole hilbert space of the system .",
    "let us denote by @xmath60 the hilbert space which is isomorphic with all subspaces generated by @xmath61 with arbitrary but fixed @xmath41 and @xmath31 ( see appendix ) .",
    "similarly @xmath62 denotes the hilbert space which is isomorphic with all spaces generated by vectors @xmath63 with arbitrary but fixed @xmath52 and @xmath31 .",
    "we mention that independently on @xmath31 , @xmath62 represents in fact a hilbert space of a system of hard core spinless particles . with this notation the whole hilbert space of the system",
    "@xmath64 is a direct sum over @xmath31 sectors @xmath65 .",
    "we underline , that introducing the notation @xmath66 , we have only @xmath67 .    in the remaining part of the paper we denote an arbitrary element of @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath62 by @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "furthermore the basis vectors of @xmath62 will be written as @xmath73 , and the basis vectors of @xmath68 as @xmath74 . with these notations",
    "the basis vectors that we have are latexmath:[$| \\ :",
    "{ \\cal r \\ : , \\ : p } \\ : \\rangle \\ : = \\ :    states @xmath73 describe in fact the charge distribution and @xmath74 the spin configuration .",
    "we have to mention that eq.([basis ] ) has to be used with care because it contains redundant information . every @xmath76 and",
    "@xmath46 uniquely define a basis vector @xmath77 , but several different pairs of permutations define the same basis vector . because of this reason indexing these basis vectors by integers , in the case of the basis set @xmath78 the index @xmath21 goes up to @xmath79 and not to @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the basis set @xmath81 has @xmath82 different elements .",
    "the reason why we express the basis vectors in term of permutations is detailed in the appendix : the hilbert space of the spin configurations for fixed @xmath9 and @xmath31 is isomorphic with a proper right ideal of the group algebra @xmath83 $ ] of the symmetric group @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that the hamiltonian presented in eq.([h ] ) can not be written in the product form @xmath84 and the effect of the hamiltonian on @xmath68 depends on the hole configuration ( charge distribution ) @xmath73 .",
    "in fact we have @xmath85 , therefore the eigenstates of @xmath15 in general case can not be written in the form @xmath86 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no @xmath87 charge spin separation taken into account at the level of the description .",
    "however , contrary to @xmath88 , the effect of spin operators does not depend on @xmath73 , i.e. on @xmath62 .",
    "this is why the decomposition of the hilbert space into sectors characterized by a fixed total spin @xmath10 can be done within @xmath89 .",
    "denoting by @xmath90 an element of @xmath91 , an arbitrary common eigenvector of @xmath32 and @xmath34 in the sector of fixed number of holes can be written as @xmath92 .",
    "the contribution @xmath93 of the hamiltonian from eq.([h ] ) has non - vanishing effect on a basis vector from eq.([basis ] ) only if @xmath21 represents a hole position and @xmath94 an electron position , i.e. @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "furthermore , regarding the spin sum in eq.([h ] ) , only the term @xmath97 of @xmath93 has non - vanishing effect in which @xmath98 . using the notation @xmath99",
    ", we obtain @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents the transposition that interchanges the indices @xmath21 and @xmath94 .",
    "the result can not be written in the form @xmath102 , because the permutation @xmath103 does not meet the requirements regarding the site ordering presented after eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the creation operators are no more situated within the product in increasing order with respect to their lattice indices because @xmath104 is situated in a wrong place .",
    "to overcome this situation , let us introduce the cyclic permutation @xmath105 which rearranges the @xmath9 pieces of operators of the last row of eq.([effect0 ] ) in the required order by moving the @xmath104 operator positioned at site @xmath106 to the required position within the product . in the @xmath107 @xmath108 case , for this purpose @xmath109 interchanges the @xmath104 operator with previous ( following ) operators .",
    "the last operator with which we interchange , is situated in the position @xmath110 . here ,",
    "in the @xmath111 case @xmath112 is the least index among the indices greater than @xmath21 for which @xmath113 , and in the @xmath107 case @xmath112 is the greatest index among the indices smaller than @xmath21 for which @xmath113 . in other words",
    "@xmath112 labels the @xmath114 lattice site whose index is closest to @xmath21 among the indices situated between @xmath21 and @xmath94 .",
    "now we have @xmath115 it can be observed that we get the ordered sequence of the operators in eq.([effect0 ] ) if we permute their indices by @xmath116",
    ". given by this , also a sign - change @xmath117 is obtained , where @xmath118 has the meaning of the parity of the permutation .",
    "based on the presented properties we obtain @xmath119    the difference between the hole configuration described by the permutation @xmath41 and @xmath120 lies in the position of one hole , which has been moved from site @xmath21 to site @xmath94 .",
    "this shows that the holes are moved by the hamiltonian as if they were hard core bosons , while the spin configuration is changing depending on the actual hole configuration . the hilbert space generated by the vectors",
    "@xmath73 is actually the hilbert space of @xmath35 hard core bosons ( @xmath73 describes the state in which @xmath35 particles are situated in the @xmath121 lattice sites positions ) .",
    "therefore , we write the effect of the hamiltonian as @xmath122 , taking into account supplementary the effect on the spin configuration . according to the appendix , the effect on the spin configuration",
    "can be described with a linear operator @xmath123 $ ] where @xmath124 is a representation of @xmath0 uniquely determined by @xmath31 .",
    "based on these considerations , the effect of the hamiltonian on the basis defined by eq.([basis ] ) can be given as @xmath125 \\",
    ": | \\ : { \\cal p } \\ : \\rangle \\ : .",
    "\\label{effect}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] starting from eq.([effect ] ) we analyze below the schrdinger equation describing the behavior of the system .",
    "due to the fact that the system is invariant under the su(2 ) global rotations , in the spin space the hamiltonian and @xmath34 are simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "therefore the spin eigensubspaces are invariant under the effect of the hamiltonian .",
    "the effect of the hamiltonian on @xmath126 can be described by a @xmath127 representation of the symmetric group independently of @xmath31 ( see appendix ) .",

    "now the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath134 \\ : ) _ { nm } \\ : = \\ : e \\ : \\alpha_{kn } \\label{schr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq.([schr ] ) gives the energy eigenvalues @xmath135 connected to the eigenstates with given total spin @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath136 coefficients in eq.([schr ] ) represent the coordinates of the energy eigenstate @xmath135 in the basis @xmath137 given as @xmath138 we have to mention that essentially the same wave vectors as presented in eq.([schrvec ] ) has been used by long and zotos ( long and zotos 1993 ) in the study of the stability of the nagaoka state , without however to write an explicit schrdinger equation for it",
    ".    it can be seen from eq.([schrvec ] ) that the matrix elements of the hamiltonian between spin states depend also on the hole configuration @xmath41 , i.e. charge distribution , so dynamically the spin degrees of freedoms are not separated from the charge degrees of freedom . at the level of the basis states",
    "however , we have the possibility to treat them separately and this allows us to write the schrdinger equation in the form of eq.([schr ] ) .",
    "we also can use eq.([schr ] ) for exact numerical diagonalizations .",
    "the main advantage of eq.([schr ] ) is that the matrix elements of the starting hamiltonian have been reduced to a direct sum of matrices related to the invariant subspaces @xmath139 .",
    "because of this reason , in concrete applications we need to solve the eigenvalue problem of eq.([schr ] ) in a relatively small hilbert space instead of @xmath60 which is much larger . for concrete application",
    "the following indications are needed in order to use eq.([schr ] ) : the matrix elements of the hard core boson hamiltonian can be easily calculated and for small number of electrons the matrix elements of the representation @xmath127 is given in mathematical textbooks ( see for example hamermesh 1962 , table 7.3 ) . for greater",
    "@xmath9 values their clear calculation procedure is also available from same sources ( see e.g. hamermesh 1962 , section 7.7 ) .",
    "eq.([schr ] ) shows explicitly the role played by the total spin @xmath10 in the schrdinger equation .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath140 , the representation @xmath141 is the alternating representation . in this case",
    "the dimension of @xmath142 is 1 , and the matrix representing every even permutation is 1 and every odd permutation is @xmath143 . because of this reason hard core fermions with maximal spin do not differ from spinless fermions ( see also long and zotos 1993 ) .",
    "the on - site interaction has no effect on spinless fermions therefore there is no differention between hard core and free particles in this case .",
    "another simple example is the 1d case with open boundary conditions . numbering the sites of the chain in order one after another",
    ", the form of every nearest neighbour pair is simply @xmath144 in this case , and we have @xmath145 whose matrix is the unity matrix for arbitrary representation . therefore there is no difference between hard core bosons and fermions , so the energy spectrum is independent of the spin of particles , only every energy eigenvalue is @xmath146 fold degenerate , @xmath10 being the spin of particles .    if @xmath147 and @xmath148 than the effect of the hamiltonian on the spin background is highly nontrivial , and influences the mobility and interaction of holes .",
    "a such type of situation was analyzed by numerical technique by trugman ( trugman 1998 ) .",
    "he showed that on nel type antiferromagnetic background one hole is mobile but two holes are less mobile than it was previously considered .",
    "this is due in fact in the language presented here by the permutation possibilities of spin positions with mobile hole positions .",
    "trugman s results underlined as well that the effect of the hamiltonian is clearly seen also on the spin background , which can not be treated entirely separated from the movement of the holes within the system .",
    "we note that the schrdinger equation eq.([schr ] ) essentially differs from kuzmin s equation ( kuzmin 1993 ) for the purpose to solve the two hole problem on singlet background . in the mentioned reference",
    "the schrdinger equation has been solved supposing implicitly that the hamiltonian has no effect on the spin degrees of freedom i.e. spin background . from eq.([schr ] ) it can be seen that this is correct in the case of a hard core boson system only .",
    "this explains why kuzmin obtains the result that the nagaoka state ( the fully polarized ferromagnetic state ) is degenerated with the singlet state even in the one hole case , in contradiction with the nagaoka s original result ( nagaoka 1966 ) . in one hole case",
    "the spectrum given by kuzmin is really related to a hard core spinless boson system spectrum , which is equivalent with the spectrum of a spinless fermion system .",
    "this last one , on its turn , is equivalent with the @xmath149 spectrum of our original electron system as presented above .",
    "the first equivalence is due to the fact that for hard core spinless particles ( both bosons and fermions ) the @xmath9 hole problem is equivalent with the @xmath9 particle problem , and in the one particle case the statistics is unimportant . for more than one hole",
    "it is not the same whether we deal with bosons or fermions even for hard core interaction .",
    "the ground state energy of the bosons is always smaller ( long and zotos 1993 ) . in order to exemplify , we mention that the equality presented by kuzmin @xmath150 gives the spectrum of a spinless hard core boson system consisting of two particles ( or equivalently two holes ) . here",
    "@xmath151 is the one particle dispersion relation and @xmath152 is the total momentum of the system . for the ground state energy of the simplest non - trivial two dimensional case , the @xmath153 lattice , eq.([kuzmin ] )",
    "gives @xmath154 while from eq.([schr ] ) one find @xmath155 which connected to the @xmath156 value of the total spin , and @xmath157 is the lowest energy value on singlet background .",
    "furthermore we note that in the two particle case the spectrum of hard core spinless boson system is identical with the spin 1/2 fermion system s singlet spectrum , therefore it can be computed using eq.([kuzmin ] ) .",
    "however , as presented here , in the @xmath158 case the behaviour of the system described by eq.([h ] ) can not be described by hard core particles and independent spin degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath9 particle and the @xmath9 hole problems are not generally equivalent , and the behaviour of few holes is more complicated than the behaviour of few particles .",
    "an asset of the representation presented in eq.([effect ] ) is that the trace of @xmath159 over the spin degrees of freedom can be computed with this relation exactly .",
    "this allows us to calculate expectation values at @xmath12 of different thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the procedure is presented as follows .",
    "if we are interested in the magnetic properties of the model eq.([h ] ) , we may express for example the expectation value of the square of the total spin .",
    "we have @xmath160 where the partition function is given by @xmath161 in eqs.([ter1],[ter2 ] ) we used the fact that @xmath162 does not depend on @xmath31 due to the su(2 ) symmetry , therefore @xmath163 for arbitrary @xmath31 . as a consequence , the subspace under the tr in the last relations from eqs.([ter1],[ter2 ] )",
    "means that the trace should be taken only over the @xmath164 subspace .    for finite lattices",
    "the tr operation means a finite sum which can be interchanged with the sum arising from the series expansion of the exponential function .",

    "7 ) all this being done , the summation @xmath200 at a fixed @xmath172 means in fact a summation over all possible cycle structures obtained above .",

    "@xmath199 having the meaning of how many times this concrete @xmath210 cycle structure has been obtained in the procedure presented above .",
    "the number @xmath196 gives the parity of all permutations which give the same cycle structure @xmath210 ( as presented in the appendix , all different permutations with the same cycle structure have the same parity ) .",

    "can be deduced for a system with arbitrary number of holes .",
    "evidently , the calculation time increases with the size of the systems , or number of holes .",
    "> from the partition function @xmath13 given in eq.([z ] ) we can compute the free energy @xmath211 and the specific heat @xmath212 .    from eq.([s^2 ] ) we correctly obtain paramagnetic behaviour at high temperatures in thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first term of the @xmath172-sum becomes dominant if @xmath213 increases , and @xmath214 if @xmath215 otherwise @xmath216 .",
    "therefore we have in high temperatures limit @xmath217 , so the value of the total spin per particle is proportional with @xmath218 .    in order to analyze the temperature dependence of @xmath219",
    "we need the values of @xmath189 as functions of @xmath172 .",
    "comparing eq.([z ] ) with the formula for the partition function @xmath13 derived in first quantized formalism we obtain @xmath220 for arbitrary conjugate class @xmath188 which can occur in eqs.([s^2],[z ] ) , where @xmath221 is the ground state energy of the @xmath9 particle hard core boson system .",
    "the knowledge of the asymptotic behaviour given by the eq.([assymptotic ] ) is enough to analyze the @xmath213 dependence of the nagaoka ferromagnetism ( i.e. @xmath178 case ) .",
    "in this situation @xmath173 contains the @xmath172 length loops of the lattice @xmath24 . for one hole ,",
    "@xmath169 is uniquely determined by the position of the hole .",
    "the positions of the hole is described by @xmath222 at the starting point of the loop , and @xmath223 at the ending point of the loop are the same .",
    "it can be seen that the parity of @xmath224 is always even when we use open boundary conditions , because there is no loop with odd length in this case .",
    "it means that the dynamical evolution controlled by the hamiltonian eq.([h ] ) is not able to permute the particles by odd permutations , given by the presence of the hard core potential acting between them . as a consequence ,",
    "the fermionic character of the particles has absolutely no effect in this case .",
    "this is fully consistent with our previous statement ( presented before eq.([kuzmin ] ) ) that the @xmath225 spectrum of our original fermion system is equivalent with the spectrum of a hard core spinless boson system .",
    "moreover , if bosons , , existed  with half spin , then there would not be differences between the system consisting of these particles with hard core potential on a square lattice and our original fermionic system in the one hole case , because the permutations @xmath226 occur in the schrdinger equation eq.([schr ] ) are always even , and for even permutations there are no difference between the representations @xmath127 connected to bosons and fermions .",
    "as we mentioned above , the ground state wave function of a boson system is always symmetric , therefore the spin wave function is also symmetric , i.e. the ground state is ferromagnetic .",
    "this extreme `` symmetry '' is an interesting explanation of nagaoka s theorem .",
    "our formalism certainly gives back this result .",
    "it is obtained by taking the @xmath227 limit in eq.([s^2 ] ) , considering the asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients @xmath189 given by eq.([assymptotic ] ) for the conjugate classes with even parity and @xmath228 for odd parity , furthermore using the result eq.([sum_c_chi ] ) from the appendix .",
    "when we use periodic boundary conditions we still have @xmath229 which , however , can be odd , but only in the case when the linear length of the lattice is odd at least in one direction , and @xmath171 goes through the boundary in this direction . in @xmath230 case",
    "@xmath231 is always positive , the sign coming from the odd parity of the permutation is compensated by the sign obtained during the movement around odd steps , therefore the above argumentation remains valid .",
    "the key feature now is the fact , that the parity of @xmath232 is in one to one correspondence with the parity of @xmath233 .",
    "the existence of more than one hole permits arbitrary ( even and odd ) permutations of the particles under the dynamical evolution ( independently of the length of the loop ) , therefore the fermionic feature of them play an important role in building up the energy spectrum of the system . using the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath189 from eq.([assymptotic ] ) and the results of the appendix presented after eq.([sum_c_chi ] ) , the @xmath219 value remains undetermined ( i.e. 0/0 ) , which is due in our interpretation to the fact that @xmath221 is not a possible energy for the fermionic system any longer .",
    "the special similarity between bosons and fermions does not remain valid , therefore we can not draw conclusion for the magnetic property of the system based on nagaoka s theorem .",
    "there is a qualitative difference between the one and two hole case .",
    "it is similar with the case when in a special point the hamiltonian has an extra symmetry , but the features of the model could be very different even close to this point due to the symmetry breaking . if bosons would have half spin ,",
    "a system consisting of such hard core bosons on a lattice would be ferromagnetic even for arbitrary hole concentration .",
    "this statement remains valid for real bosons with integer ( non zero ) spin as well and the expectational value of the total spin goes to a macroscopical ( but not to the maximum ) value when the temperature goes to zero , in this case .    in order to obtain information about the two ( or more ) hole case , the study of eq.([s^2 ] )",
    "is needed . to deduce the @xmath189 numbers one can use monte carlo methods . for example , by random sampling we can determine the percentage of the contribution of loops with a given length in @xmath234",
    ". however , we have to mention , that the trace over the spin degrees of freedom has been taken already , and because of this reason , the presented procedure increases the efficiency of the usual world line algorithm . in this case , we need only a sampling from the world lines of the holes , which are @xmath235 times less than all the different world lines of the electrons . to see the trend of the magnetic behaviour in the @xmath213 dependence ,",
    "we have determined the @xmath189 coefficients up to the 14-th order exactly , and further , from 15-th up to the 50-th order by monte carlo in the case of a @xmath236 lattice with two holes .",
    "the square of the total spin per particle and the specific heat deduced from these results are presented in fig1.a . and",
    "b. as the temperature decreases the error of our results increases , but it is clear that the total spin increases , which underline a tendency to ferromagnetism at @xmath237 within the accuracy of our calculation .",
    "summarizing , we have analyzed a simple one - band hubbard model in @xmath238 limit in any dimensions .",
    "we have treated this problem for the case in which an arbitrary but fixed hole concentration is present within the system .",
    "concentrating on the effect of the hamiltonian on the charge and spin degrees of freedom and based on the representations of the symmetric group , we presented an exact schrdinger equation in a form which explicitly shows the effect of the spin background in the movement of the holes .",
    "explications related to the application of the presented equation in concrete situations were given in detail .",
    "based on the deduced results we have showed that the effect of the spin background on the movement of holes is unimportant a ) when the system is one dimensional with open boundary condition and b ) in any dimensions when the spin of the background is maximum . in the first case the holes move as hard core spinless bosons , in the second case as hard core spinless fermions .",
    "when we have @xmath147 and @xmath239 the effect of the spin background seen in the motion of the holes and the energy spectrum is highly non - trivial .",
    "the nagaoka ferromagnetism ( @xmath178 case ) in our formalism is due to the fact that in the one hole case and @xmath1 , the rearrangement of particles with odd parity permutations in the dynamical evolution of the system is impossible . therefore , the fermionic feature is not playing any role , and the system is equivalent with a system of hypothetical hard core half - spin boson system whose ground state is trivially ferromagnetic . in the presence of more than one hole",
    "this is no more true and the complete separation of charge and spin degrees of freedom is impossible .    on the other hand , based on our representation of the hamiltonian",
    ", the trace over the spin degrees of freedom can be computed exactly .",
    "the presented procedure allows us to express the partition function , free energy , specific heat and the expectational value of the square of the total spin .",
    "the calculations can be given based on the counting of loop contributions , whose steps were described in extreme details for potential applications . in principle the method allows to calculate @xmath14 expectation values for an arbitrary number of holes , based on clear formal steps handable by computer . in the frame of this formalism the efficiency of the usual monte carlo methods can also be increased .",
