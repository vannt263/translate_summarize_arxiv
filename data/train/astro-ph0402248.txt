    "numerical simulations of galaxy formation and interactions often include rules for star formation . in many cases ,",
    "the local rate of star formation , @xmath0 , is related to the local gas density , @xmath1 , by a power law : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a constant . this prescription has been justified both empirically and theoretically . from an empirical perspective , ( [ sfr - power - law ] )",
    "resembles the `` schmidt law '' @xcite , which relates star formation per unit surface area , @xmath4 to gas surface density , @xmath5 ; a recent determination of the schmidt law @xcite is @xmath6 @xcite adopted a rule equivalent to ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) with @xmath7 as an approximation to a schmidt law with index @xmath8 , while @xcite took @xmath9 , and presented numerical tests showing this gave a reasonable match to a schmidt law with index @xmath10 .",
    "a more theoretical approach , adopted by @xcite and @xcite , sets @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , the time - scale for star formation , is basically proportional to the local collapse time of the gas , @xmath13 .",
    "this yields ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) with @xmath9 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a dimensionless constant .    despite the apparent convergence of observation and theory on the index @xmath9 , it s unlikely that ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) really captures the process of star formation .",
    "for one thing , only about @xmath16  per cent of the gas actually forms stars per collapse time @xmath17 ; in other words , consistency with the observations implies that @xmath18 .",
    "current theories of star formation do nt offer any straightforward way to calculate this quantity .",
    "gravitational collapse is evidently not the limiting factor which sets the rate of star formation ; `` feedback '' processes are important in determining the fraction of available interstellar material which ultimately becomes stars . while several groups have now devised simulations including star formation regulated by various forms of feedback ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , this approach still has some way to go .",
    "moreover , models based on ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) do nt reproduce the large - scale star formation seen in many interacting galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that most of the star formation was confined to the central regions of their model galaxies , while @xcite noted that ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) underestimated the rate of star formation in regions where interstellar gas exhibits large velocity dispersions and gradients , or where the gas appears to be undergoing strong shocks .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have modeled the central bursts of star formation seen in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "but nuclear starbursts , while a necessary stage in the transformation of merger remnants into elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , may not be sufficient to accomplish this transformation .",
    "for example , merger - induced starbursts create massive young star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) which may subsequently evolve into globular clusters , but these clusters will be confined to the nuclei of remnants _ unless _ the starbursts are spatially extended .    in view of these considerations , it s worth examining alternatives to ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) .",
    "one long standing idea is that collisions of molecular clouds trigger of star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this has been implemented in `` sticky particle '' schemes which model the interstellar medium as a collection of discrete clouds undergoing inelastic collisions ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , molecular clouds have relatively long mean free paths , and direct collisions between clouds at velocities of @xmath19 or more may result in disruption rather than star formation .",
    "@xcite proposed a model of shock - induced star formation in interacting galaxies ; specifically , they suggested that fast collisions between extended h clouds create a high - pressure medium which compresses pre - existing molecular clouds and thereby induces bursts of star formation .",
    "high - pressure regions , and especially large - scale shocks in colliding galaxies , may favor the formation of bound star clusters @xcite .",
    "recent observations at optical , infrared , and radio wavelengths continue to reveal large - scale star formation in interacting galaxies , including ngc4038/9 , arp299 , and ngc4676 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several of these studies explicitly invoke shock - induced star formation in discussing the observational data . in this paper",
    "i focus on ngc4676 , a strongly interacting pair of disk galaxies with long tidal tails ( @xcite , hereafter tt72 ; @xcite ) , as a test - case for models of shock - induced and density - dependent star formation .",
    "  2 describes the star formation algorithms . ",
    "3 presents simulations of ngc4676 , and contrasts the results of shock - induced and density - dependent star formation rules .",
    "conclusions are given in ",
    "within the framework of `` smoothed particle hydrodynamics '' or sph ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) , the interstellar material can be modeled as an isothermal gas with a representative temperature @xmath20 .",
    "this approach is less complex than others which include radiative cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , heating by massive stars @xcite , or other feedback effects @xcite .",
    "however , previous studies indicate that simple isothermal models capture much of the relevant dynamical behavior of interstellar gas in interacting galaxies , including large - scale shocks , nuclear inflows , and the formation of extended gas disks in merger remnants ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    with the gas temperature fixed ,",
    "there remain two interesting local quantities which are easily evaluated in an sph simulation : the gas density , @xmath1 , and the rate of mechanical heating due to shocks and @xmath21 work , @xmath22 .",
    "( an isothermal model assumes that radiative processes locally balance mechanical heating or cooling . ) in galactic simulations , the gas temperature is much lower than the virial temperature , so most shocks are highly supersonic and shock heating exceeds @xmath21 work by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus shocks can be identified as regions with @xmath22 significantly larger than zero ; this criterion serves to locate shock fronts @xcite .    making use of both @xmath1 and @xmath22 , i consider a general star - formation prescription of the form @xmath23 where the max function , which returns the larger of its two arguments , is used to handle situations in which @xmath24 .",
    "this prescription is implemented in a probabilistic fashion ; the chance of gas particle @xmath25 undergoing star formation in a time interval @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the gas density and heating rate for particle @xmath25 , are defined in appendix  a. at each time - step , @xmath30 is computed for each gas particle and compared with a random number @xmath31 freshly drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath32 and @xmath16 . if @xmath33 then the gas particle is instantly and completely converted to a star particle , which subsequently evolves collisionlessly . for later analysis , each star particle formed during a simulation is tagged with the value of the time @xmath34 at its moment of birth .",
    "while ( [ sfr - two - power - law ] ) can encompass a wide range of rules , this paper focuses on two limiting cases .",
    "first , setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 yields _ density - dependent _ star formation , in which @xmath37 with _ no _ dependence on @xmath22 , and regions of higher density produce more stars .",
    "second , setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 yields _ shock - induced _ star formation , in which @xmath40 ; star formation is strictly limited to regions with @xmath41 , which typically correspond to shocks .",
    "more general rules with both @xmath35 and @xmath39 are beyond the scope of this paper , but it may be possible to anticipate their behavior using experience gained with the simple cases described here .",
    "simulations of shock - induced star formation are subject to resolution effects .",
    "the width of a shock region in sph is @xmath42 times the local smoothing scale @xmath43 @xcite ( in these experiments , @xmath43 is set to enclose @xmath44 gas particles within a radius @xmath45 of each gas particle @xmath25 ; see appendix  b ) .",
    "consider a situation in which a gas particle encounters a shock of some fixed strength .",
    "the time that the particle spends in the shock scales as @xmath43 , while the total amount of energy it dissipates is independent of @xmath43 , so @xmath46 .",
    "thus the net probability that the gas particle is transformed into a star particle while passing through the shock is proportional to @xmath47 .",
    "the specific choice @xmath48 should produce results which are approximately independent of the spatial resolution .",
    "for other choices for @xmath49 the star formation rate will depend on resolution ; to obtain roughly equivalent results in simulations with different spatial resolutions , it will be necessary to adjust the parameter @xmath3 .",
    "resolution effects also arise in simulations with density - dependent star formation rules .",
    "such simulations do a good job of reproducing the observed relationship ( [ schmidt - kennicutt - law ] ) between gas density and star formation rate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "but current sph simulations generally do nt resolve the vertical structure of gas in galactic disks , so this success may be due , in part , to compensating errors at different distances from the disk midplane .",
    "more critically , although shocks with mach numbers of @xmath50 to  @xmath51 will boost the density of an isothermal gas by factors of @xmath52 to  @xmath53 @xcite , these high - density regions are not resolved in existing sph calculations , and the localized bursts of star formation which should result have not been seen in the numerical models . in principle , simulations using density - dependent rules can exhibit shock - induced star formation , but the computing power required to achieve the necessary resolution may not yet be available .",
    "on account of their rounded bodies and long tails , the two galaxies making up ngc4676 were dubbed the `` playing mice '' by @xcite .",
    "the far left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] shows a deep optical image , overlain by contours of h @xcite , while the adjacent panel shows a shallower image .",
    "the individual galaxies are ngc4676a , to the north , and ngc4676b , to the southeast .",
    "the length and straightness of the bright northern tail imply that we are viewing the aftermath of a nearly - direct passage roughly edge - on to the orbit and disk planes , while the curve of the fainter southern tail is consistent with a more face - on view of an inclined disk .",
    "the fairly equal lengths of the two tails suggests that the galaxies involved had roughly equal masses .",
    "along with long - slit data indicating that both `` hulks '' rotate with north receding ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , these considerations led tt72 to a simple model for this system .",
    "their model required that the northern hulk recede faster than the southern one , a prediction soon confirmed with h@xmath54 spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "most kinematic studies , whether based on h@xmath54 spectroscopy @xcite , h interferometry @xcite , or co interferometry @xcite , yield results consistent with @xcite s . on the other hand , h@xmath54 spectroscopy by @xcite indicated a remarkably large difference of @xmath55 between the nucleus of ngc4676a and its associated tail , and a large velocity dispersion within the tail itself",
    "; it s tempting to interpret this as measurement error , but @xcite reported somewhat similar results , so the situation is not entirely clear . nonetheless , h interferometry appears the best choice for tracing the large - scale dynamics of the system , inasmuch as it provides a full map of the velocity field , and neutral hydrogen is unlikely to be disturbed by star formation .      the model of ngc4676 used in this paper is based on work with j.  hibbard ( hibbard & barnes , in preparation ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "in view of some concerns noted below , this model is somewhat preliminary , but it seems to describe the overall evolution of the system reasonably well",
    ".    the initial conditions for the individual galaxies each have three components : a bulge with a shallow cusp @xcite , an exponential disk with constant scale height ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and a dark halo with a constant - density core , based on a `` gamma model '' ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "density profiles for these components are @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the spherical radius , @xmath58 is the cylindrical radius in the disk plane , and @xmath59 is the distance from the disk plane .",
    "numerical results are presented using a system of units with @xmath60 . in these units ,",
    "the components have masses @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and length scales @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 . with these parameters ,",
    "the disk has a rotation period of @xmath68 time units at @xmath69 .",
    "scale factors relating simulation units to real physical quantities will be determined as part of the model - matching process .    beginning with tt72 s model",
    ", we ran experiments systematically varying the relative orbit and orientation of the two identical galaxies .",
    "the following parameters produced the reasonably good fit to ngc4676 shown on the right and far right of fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "first , the initial orbit was parabolic , with a pericentric separation @xmath70 .",
    "second , the disks of ngc4676a and ngc4676b were initially inclined to the orbital plane by @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "third , the initial angle between each disk s line of nodes and the direction of separation at pericenter was @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "fourth , the system was evolved @xmath16 time unit past pericenter .",
    "we used an interactive display program to rotate the model to best match the observed morphology and kinematics ngc4676 ; further details of the matching process will appear in a subsequent paper .    comparing the model with the observations , the main discrepancy is the position angle of ngc4676b s bar ; optical images show the bar runs roughly nne  ssw , while the bar in the model is roughly n  s or even nnw  sse .",
    "the pattern speed of a bar depends on the details of the rotation curve , so this discrepancy might be resolved by adjusting the mass model used for ngc4676b .",
    "it s also possible that ngc4676b s bar predates its encounter with ngc4676a , in which case the bar s current position angle would depend on its phase at pericenter @xcite .",
    "however , the hypothesis that ngc4676b s bar was induced by the tidal interaction is more parsimonious and has not yet been tested by experiments using a range of mass models .",
    "the time yielding the best match between the model and ngc4676 proved somewhat ambiguous ; by adjusting the viewing angle and scaling factors , acceptable matches to the tail morphology and kinematics were obtained for @xmath75  to  @xmath76 time units after pericenter . at @xmath77 , a good match was obtained by equating one length unit to @xmath78 , and one velocity unit to @xmath79 .",
    "this scaling assumes that ngc4676 s distance is @xmath80 , consistent with @xmath81 and ngc4676 s systemic velocity of @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "one time unit then works out to @xmath83 , and pericenter occurred @xmath84 ago .",
    "finally , one mass unit is @xmath85 .    given this scaling ,",
    "the initial parameters of the model galaxies can be computed .",
    "for example , the initial disks have reasonable scale lengths @xmath86 and masses @xmath87 ; on the other hand , they have maximum circular velocities of @xmath88 , which seem rather high and might be repaired by increasing the halo scale radius @xmath89 .",
    "since tt72 s work , ngc4676 has been modeled by several other groups .",
    "@xcite essentially produced a self - consistent clone of tt72 s model , even adopting a short - period elliptical orbit like the one tt72 s test - particle methodology dictated ; they favored an earlier viewing time which matched the position angle of ngc4676b s bar but produced tails significantly shorter than those observed .",
    "@xcite used @xcite s ( @xcite ) velocity data to construct a self - consistent model with a parabolic initial orbit . in most respects ,",
    "their model is very similar to the one described here , although we favor a closer passage to increase the heft of the tidal tails .",
    "@xcite produced a test - particle model , restricted to ngc4676a , which matched the general trend of their velocity data but not the large velocity dispersion they reported within the northern tail .",

    "[ fig02 ] compares global star formation rates for three different simulations of ngc4676 .",
    "to illustrate the range of possibilities , i contrast one simulation with density - dependent star formation ( solid line : @xmath9 , @xmath36 , @xmath96 ) and two simulations with shock - induced star formation ( dashed line : @xmath38 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ; dotted line : @xmath38 , @xmath48 , @xmath95 ) .",
    "all of these simulations were based on the initial orbit and disk orientations described in   3.1 ; the gas was initially distributed like the disk stars , and the gas mass in each disk was @xmath97 .",
    "further numerical details are given in appendix  b.        in simulations with density - dependent star formation , setting the constant @xmath96 yielded a baseline star formation rate per disk of @xmath98 ( see appendix  c ) ; at this rate , an undisturbed disk would consume its gas on a time - scale of @xmath99 time units ( @xmath100 ) . in the simulation with shock - induced star formation and @xmath93 ,",
    "a similar baseline rate of @xmath101 was obtained by setting @xmath94 ; this gave reasonable behavior throughout the encounter .",
    "on the other hand , it was necessary to adopt a much lower baseline rate of @xmath102 in the simulation of shock - induced star formation with @xmath48 to avoid using up most of the gas in the earliest stages of the encounter ; setting @xmath95 insured that this case ultimately consumed about as much gas as the other two .",
    "[ fig02 ] shows , the density - dependent simulation predict that the star formation rate remains fairly constant until some time after the first passage .",
    "eventually , as the gas encountered shocks and gravitationally interacted with the tidally induced bars in the stellar disks , it began accumulating in the centers of the galaxies , driving a fairly gradual increase in star formation . the two shock - induced simulations , on the other hand , produced sharp bursts of star formation as the disks interpenetrated ( @xmath103 ) , followed by brief lulls as the disks separated .",
    "soon thereafter , star formation rates rose again as gas flows intersected in the perturbed disks ; this produced the broad peaks , centered on @xmath104 , accounting for most of the stars formed before @xmath105 .",
    "as one might expect , the simulation with @xmath48 exhibited the most extreme form of this behavior , with a higher peak at @xmath90 and a deeper minimum immediately thereafter .",
    "these various star formation histories have interesting observational implications . according to the density - dependent simulation ,",
    "star formation in ngc4676 has just begun responding to the encounter , and the peak star formation rate will occur several hundred myr from now .",
    "in contrast , the shock - induced models predict that we are observing the system a short time after the broad peaks of star formation at @xmath106 .",
    "this difference in star formation history is fairly insensitive to the choice of @xmath3 , which influences the overall amplitude of star formation but does little to change the timing of starbursts .",

    "the top row of images set the stage by showing distributions of old disk stars and gas , taken from a simulation without star formation .",
    "the middle row shows distributions of old disk stars and star particles formed according to the density - dependent rule ( @xmath9 , @xmath36 , @xmath96 ) ; colors indicate ages of star particles , with red being youngest and blue oldest .",
    "the bottom row presents results for a simulation with shock - induced star formation ( @xmath38 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) using the same color coding .",

    "[ fig03 ] shows that the star formation rule clearly influences the distribution of newly - formed stars . in the density - dependent model ,",
    "star formation was always strongly concentrated toward the central regions of the disks . some star formation did occur outside the centers , but it was relatively weak and short - lived .",
    "in contrast , the shock - induced models produced large , spatially - extended bursts of star formation as the disks collided at @xmath90 , and relatively high levels of activity persisted in the bridge and tail regions until @xmath107 .    by the last time ( @xmath108 ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , products of star formation are much more widely distributed in the shock - induced simulations than in the density - dependent simulation .",
    "rather interesting in this regard are the gas - poor features which extend to roughly five oclock from the upper galaxy and to eleven oclock from the lower galaxy .",
    "these regions were swept free of gas during the interpenetrating encounter of the two disks . in the simulations with shock - induced star formation ,",
    "some of this gas was converted to stars _ before _ losing much momentum ; as a result , star formed in the pericentric bursts are scattered throughout these gas - poor regions . by contrast , these regions are bereft of both gas _ and _ star - formation products in the density - dependent simulation .",
    "[ fig04 ] presents views which approximate the observed morphology and kinematics of ngc4676 .",

    "the shock - induced simulations produced just such bursts at first passage ( @xmath103 ) , and the products of these bursts are widely distributed throughout the tidal tails at later times .",

    "outside of the centers of the galaxies , star - forming regions are observed in the straight tail extending to the north of ngc4676a .",
    "none of the simulations presented here reproduce this phenomenon , although the shock - induced models come closer inasmuch as they show enhanced star formation in their tails until @xmath107 ; the density - dependent model seems less promising in this regard since star formation in its tails declines after first passage .",
    "images also show ongoing star formation at the base of the curved tail to northeast of ngc4676b .",
    "this region has a relatively high surface brightness and is conspicuously blue in the acs images ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the present calculations also produce bursts of star formation associated with pericentric passages , but orbit decay in these fully self - consistent calculations is much more abrupt than in @xcite s experiments , possibly because the self - gravity of the gas is included .",

    "dissipation is a necessary precursor for any significant increase in central gas density , since gas can only accumulate in galactic centers as a result of an irreversible process .",
    "the rate of increase in gas density closely tracks the net energy radiated away in shocks ( @xcite , fig .",
    "6 ) ; globally , @xmath22 and @xmath138 are strongly correlated .",
    "thus , models of shock - induced star formation can respond promptly to external disturbances , while little activity occurs in density - dependent models until @xmath1 has had time to build up .",
    "the larger spatial extent of star formation in shock - induced models is , in part , a corollary of the earlier onset of activity in such models , since the gas is more widely distributed at earlier times .",
    "density - dependent rules may be used to implement unified models of star formation in normal and interacting galaxies .",
    "the disks of normal galaxies _ and _ the central regions of starburst galaxies fit onto the same power law @xcite .",
    "thus , by setting @xmath3 to match the baseline rate of star formation in unperturbed disks , @xcite were able to produce starbursts comparable to those inferred in ultraluminous infrared galaxies @xcite ; this represents a real success for the model defined by ( [ sfr - power - law ] ) with @xmath9 .",
    "but there is abundant evidence for large - scale star formation in interacting galaxies .",
    "this includes ongoing star formation in the `` overlap regions '' of systems like ngc4038/9 and arp299 , as well as the h@xmath54 emission from the tails of ngc4676 .",
    "it also includes the a - star spectra seen in the tails of ngc4676 and throughout the body of ngc7252 .",
    "density - dependent star formation ca nt easily explain these observations ; interactions funnel gas from the disks to the central regions of galaxies , thereby promoting rapid star formation in galactic nuclei but reducing the supply of gas needed for star formation elsewhere .",
    "moreover , violent relaxation ceases long before binding energies are effectively randomized ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , so merging is ineffective at transporting the products of star formation outward from nuclei to the bodies of merger remnants .",
    "thus , density - dependent rules offer at best an incomplete description of star formation in interacting galaxies .    in simulations with shock - induced rules ,",
    "the star formation rate depends on dynamical circumstances .",
    "shocks in unperturbed disks are associated with transient spiral patterns , and matching the baseline level of star formation depends on reproducing the `` right '' level of spiral structure .",
    "this , in itself , is a tough problem , and it s not clear that shock - induced models will soon yield a unified description of star formation in normal _ and _ interacting galaxies . until this becomes possible ,",
    "unperturbed disks ca nt be used to set @xmath3 , so the amplitude of a shock - induced starburst ca nt be predicted _ a priori_. nonetheless , shock - induced star formation is an important element of galactic collisions , and its implementation in numerical simulations is a useful step toward increased realism .",
    "these simulations have contrasted two limits of ( [ sfr - two - power - law ] ) : density - dependent star formation , with @xmath139 and @xmath36 , and shock - induced star formation , with @xmath38 and @xmath140 .",
    "these cases were chosen as instructive examples , but ( [ sfr - two - power - law ] ) is general enough to accommodate additional possibilities .",
    "first , setting @xmath35 and @xmath49 just slightly larger than @xmath32 would yield a modified law in which star formation is proportional to @xmath141 but occurs _ only _ in regions with @xmath41 ; this resembles the rule adopted by @xcite , who basically took @xmath142 but restricted star formation to regions with convergent flows .",
    "notice that cases with @xmath143 are _ not _ continuous with the case @xmath36 ; in the latter , star formation is strictly independent of @xmath22 .",
    "second , setting @xmath35 and @xmath39 would yield hybrid rules in which star formation depends on both @xmath1 and @xmath22 .",
    "the consequences of such rules can sometimes be inferred from the limiting cases considered here .",
    "for example , in the simulations of ngc4676 with shock - induced star formation , the gas involved in burst b@xmath121 has densities @xmath144 times higher than the gas involved in burst b@xmath117 ; setting @xmath35 would boost b@xmath121 relative to b@xmath117 by a factor of @xmath145 , assuming that neither burst was limited by the supply of gas .",
    "perhaps most exciting are the new avenues for research created by an alternative description of star formation in galaxy interactions :    * in contrast to density - dependent star formation , which seems fairly insensitive to most details of galactic encounters @xcite , different encounter geometries may yield a variety of shock - induced star formation histories .",
    "a survey of different encounters , along the lines of other surveys without star formation ( e.g.  @xcite ) , might establish if widespread star formation at first passage is generic or limited to a subset of close encounters , and also determine if shock - induced star formation can account for ultraluminous infrared galaxies .",
    "* shock - induced star formation makes definite predictions about the _ timing _ of starbursts triggered by galactic encounters .",
    "as already mentioned , models including the photometric evolution of starburst populations could sharpen the comparison between simulations and observations of systems like ngc4676 . in addition , these models might predict the ages of embedded young star clusters ; such predictions could be checked by multi - object spectroscopy of the clusters . * in the context of merger simulations , shock - induced star formation also yields predictions for the spatial distribution and kinematics of starburst populations .",
    "it would be quite interesting to compare these predictions with observations of the distribution and kinematics of metal - rich globular clusters in elliptical galaxies , which may have been formed in merger - induced starbursts ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "* encounters between gas - rich galaxies at redshifts of a few seem a natural setting for shock - induced star formation . while many high-@xmath59 galaxies have peculiar morphologies ( e.g.  @xcite ) , the bridges and tails characteristic of low-@xmath59 encounters ( tt72 ) are not very evident . instead , the optical morphology of these objects may be dominated by rest - frame uv from widespread starbursts ; if so , the photometric modeling approach described above could help interpret existing and forthcoming observations of interacting galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts .",

    "i use an adaptive sph code in which each gas particle @xmath25 is assigned smoothing length @xmath43 which depends on local conditions .",

    "one may nonetheless compute the mechanical heating rate @xmath153 associated with the pressure and ( artificial ) viscous forces on each particle @xmath25 , and assume that this heating is _ exactly _ balanced by radiative processes .",

    "the disk galaxies used in the star formation simulations had a total of @xmath164 particles each , with @xmath165 for the gas , @xmath166 for the stellar disk , @xmath167 for the bulge , and @xmath168 for the halo .",
    "the gas was initially distributed like the stellar disk , and accounted for @xmath169 per cent of the total disk mass . in simulation units ,",

    "these calculations were run with a sph code featuring adaptive smoothing and individual particle timesteps .",
    "the smoothing radius @xmath43 of each gas particle was set so that a sphere of radius @xmath45 contains exactly @xmath44 gas particles .",

    "depending on the star formation parameters , each simulation took between @xmath178  and @xmath179 on a @xmath180 processor ; the run without star formation was the slowest since its gas attained the highest densities .    in practice ,",
    "the limited resolution of computer simulations introduces effects which complicate the interpretation of numerical experiments .",
    "smoothing over a sphere of radius @xmath45 inevitably suppresses structures on smaller scales .",
    "the gas disks used in this paper provide good examples ; for the simulation parameters given above , only half of the disk particles have smoothing radii @xmath43 less than the vertical scale height @xmath181 ! clearly , the vertical structure of these disks is not resolved  and the same is true for most sph simulations of interacting galaxies published to date . in this circumstance , sph underestimates @xmath1 close to the midplane , and overestimates @xmath1 far from the midplane .",
    "to better characterize the behavior of the galaxy models used in the simulations of ngc4676 , i ran some test calculations of isolated disks .",
    "these can be used to establish the baseline rate of star formation in non - interacting disks , and to examine the radial distribution of star formation for various choices of @xmath182 and @xmath49 .",

    "the isolated disk models proved stable for the duration of the calculation .",
