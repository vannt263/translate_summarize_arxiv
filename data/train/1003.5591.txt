    "recently , the physics of ultracold dipolar gases has received growing attention .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies are motivated by the long - range and anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction which introduce a rich variety of quantum phases @xcite .",
    "for instance , supersolid and checkerboard phases are predicted in the phase diagram of polarized dipolar bosons confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical lattice @xcite . in bilayer samples where dipole interactions can also be attractive more exotic quantum phases are accessible , for example a pair - supersolid @xcite .",
    "experiments with ultracold atoms have now highlighted the role of dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "notably , with @xmath0cr , control via feshbach resonances allows one to efficiently reduce contact interactions and enter a regime where magnetic dipole - dipole interactions become dominant @xcite .",
    "polar molecules also appear very promising towards implementation of degenerate dipolar gases ( see @xcite and references therein ) , in particular since the demonstration of ultra - cold rubidium - potassium , and lithium - cesium molecules prepared in their ground rotovibrational state @xcite",
    ".    note that in most cases , if not all cases considered so far , dipolar gases are polarized , i.e. magnetic or electric dipoles point in the same direction .",
    "this , however , does not have to be the case always .",
    "a prominent example is that of exciton gases .",
    "excitons , which are bound electron - hole pairs , obviously carry an electric dipole moment that can _ a priori _ attain quite arbitrary directions .",
    "nevertheless , in indirect quantum wells , electrons and holes are confined in spatially separated regions such that electric dipoles can be aligned @xcite or even anti - aligned in type - ii heterostructures @xcite .",
    "another extreme case concerns molecules that follow the hund s rule ( a ) @xcite . for such molecules",
    "the electric dipole is either parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of the magnetic moment .",
    "if one takes thus a sample of such molecules and polarizes it magnetically , say in the up direction , one will obtain in this way a dipolar gas with certain fraction of electric dipoles pointing up , and the remaining fraction pointing down .",
    "this is the situation that we study in the present paper .",
    "in fact there was recently a spectacular progress in cooling and trapping of magnetically confined neutral oh molecules .",
    "this progress opens important perspectives to study novel quantum phases with ultracold dipoles @xcite . in its ro - vibronic ground state",
    "oh is indeed a hund s case ( a ) molecule , and it features both an electric @xmath1 and a magnetic dipole moment @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 being the bohr magneton ) , which can be aligned or anti - aligned independently . using these two degrees of freedom ,",
    "oh molecules may be confined in a 2d optical lattice , where the dipolar interactions lead to rich quantum phases , as we show in this work .",
    "we study here a sample of bosonic dipoles confined in a 2d lattice .",
    "we consider that dipoles are free to point in both directions normal to the lattice plane .",
    "this constitutes a novel ingredient compared to our previous works @xcite , and results in a nearest neighbor interaction either repulsive for aligned dipoles , or attractive for anti - aligned ones .",
    "we consider the case of dipolar interactions to be relatively weak compared to the contact interactions , and remarkably we find that the dipole - dipole interactions dominate the physics of the system . using a mean - field gutzwiller approach , we show that the system presents mott - insulating phases with ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic ordering , as well as with fractional values of the average magnetization , depending on the imbalance between the population of dipoles pointing in opposite directions .",
    "we also find evidences of a novel _ counterflow supersolid _ quantum phase .",
    "the latter exhibits broken translational symmetry , namely a modulation of the order parameter on a length scale larger than the one of the lattice spacing , analogously to supersolid phases .",
    "we consider a sample of dipoles in the presence of a 2d optical lattice , and an extra confinement in the perpendicular direction .",

    "in conclusion , in this work we have studied a gas of dipolar bosons confined in a two - dimensional optical lattice , where the dipoles are free to point in both directions perpendicular to the lattice plane .",

    "our work in a sense is the first step in the studies of dipolar gases with non - polarized dipoles , and is relevant for experimental studies of the ultracold oh molecules .",
