    "the general relativity as the theory of gravitation is triumphantly tested in `` classical experiments '' @xcite on    * the deflection of light by the sun , * the perihelion precession of mercury , * the gravitational redshift of electromagnetic radiation , * the time delay of signal from satellites due to the curved space - time , and * the gyroscope precession during the orbital motion around the earth as caused by the spatial curvature @xcite .",
    "in addition , an expanding universe is the prediction being inherent for the general relativity .",
    "sure , the general relativity conceptually is the perfect theory of classic gravity . in this respect , we usually expect that it is valid , indeed , until effects of quantum gravity would be essential at planckian scales of energy that is unreachable in practice .",
    "however , such the point of view , perhaps , is actually broken :    the general relativity itself gives us a brilliant tool in order to search for indications , which signalize on breaking down its validity : while observing a motion by inertia , we get a curvature of space - time , which can be inserted into einstein equations , that yields a tensor of energy - momentum for an appropriate substance , and if properties of the substance are mysterious and unpredictable , then we get a hint for suspecting of the incorrect description for the nature .",
    "this is exactly the case of hypothetic dark matter ( see , for instance , review in @xcite ) : in the framework of general relativity , it should be inevitably introduced as a transparent pressureless substance dynamically isolated from the ordinary visible matter made of known , well studied particles , except the interaction via the gravity , so that properties of dark matter are artificially tuned .",
    "this tuning has various aspects .",
    "first , rotational curves in disc - like galaxies , i.e. dependencies of rotation velocities of stars versus a distance to the galaxy center , if described by the law of newtonian gravity , requires the introduction of dark matter with a tuned spatial distribution .",
    "unexpectedly , the dark matter halo is inessential in regions , wherein the gravitational acceleration caused by the visible matter , is greater than a critical value @xmath0 , while the halo starts to dominate in regions , wherein the acceleration by the visible matter is less than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "that was m. milgrom who first introduced the critical acceleration @xmath0 in the description of rotational curves @xcite .",
    "it is spectacular that the critical acceleration is universal : it does not depend on a genesis of disk - like galaxy , and it is the same for any studied disc - like galaxy .",
    "unbelievably , an amount and spatial distribution of dark matter is tuned to the amount and distribution of visible matter in order to form in cosmic collisions the dark halos in disc - like galaxies with the same universal critical acceleration . in the framework of general relativity , there is no straightforward dynamical mechanism for a deduction of such the universal acceleration .",
    "anyway , the deduction looks to be very artificial , most probably , it certainly could be the fine tuning .",
    "the critical acceleration subtly binds the dark matter to the visible matter .",
    "if this relation is dynamical , then it is not due to newtonian gravity , that does not include any critical acceleration .",
    "further , in deep regions of dark halo dominance , the rotation velocities tend to constant values @xmath1 , that empirically satisfy the baryonic tully  fisher law @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 stands for the mass of visible matter in disc - like galaxy , @xmath4 denotes the newton constant .",
    "again , the dark matter halo is tuned , so that the star motion within the halo strictly correlates with the usual visible matter , while the constant @xmath0 is universal @xcite .",
    "finally , in order to complete the first item of argumentation , features in distributions of visible matter , no doubt , are imprinted in rotational curves even in regions of dark matter dominance @xcite , hence , features of dark matter distributions are tuned to the visible matter , though we have no dynamical reasons for such the correlations in the framework of general relativity .",
    "moreover , the morphology of spatial distributions is absolutely different for the baryonic and dark matter in disc - like galaxies : an exponentially falling central bulge and thin disc of stars and gas in contrast to power - law decline of dark spherical halo .",
    "thus , the universal critical acceleration is the mysterious quantity for the general relativity , that can not be predicted , while its notion emerged empirically .",
    "the critical acceleration @xmath0 reveals the fine tuning of hypothetic dark matter to the ordinary visible matter .",
    "second , in cosmology with the observed accelerated expansion of universe by data on a dependence of brightness of type ia supernovae versus the red shift @xcite , the general relativity was have to introduce the extended dark sector , which includes a homogeneous dark energy in addition to the nonhomogeneous dark matter . in the simplest case",
    ", the dark energy can be represented by the cosmological constant , otherwise it should be described by a homogeneous fluid @xmath5 with the state parameter @xmath6 being the ratio of pressure @xmath7 to energy density @xmath8 , @xmath9 close to vacuum value of @xmath10 , in contrast to the pressureless dark matter with @xmath11 . evidently , the nature of dark matter and dark energy is very different .",
    "but surprisingly , the energy density of dark energy , or the value of cosmological constant @xmath12 , is finely tuned to the critical acceleration @xcite , so that @xmath13 therefore , the dark energy should be inherently connected to the unexpectedly correlated dynamics of dark matter and ordinary matter .",
    "but the coincidence of ( [ finet ] ) is mysterious for the general relativity .    nevertheless , the general relativity applied to the cosmos still looks formally viable in the form of concordance model : the ordinary matter balanced with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant @xmath12 in the flat space , the @xmath14 variant with a spatial curvature compatible with zero in limits of uncertainties",
    ". moreover , there are two important successes in the model : 1 ) a correct fitting for observed anisotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite that becomes possible due to a tuned amount of non - baryonic dark matter , and 2 ) an appropriate baryon to photon ratio consistent with a current status of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) ( see review by fields b d , sarkar s in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the anisotropy of cmbr is suppressed by 5 orders of magnitude with respect to the cmbr temperature , and it is caused by a propagation of sound waves in a hot photon - electron - baryon medium up to a moment , when the electrons bind to nuclei to form neutral transparent gas .",
    "the snapshot of universe at the time of decoupling of photons evolves to us , and it represents acoustic peaks in the following multipole spectrum of temperature fluctuations @xmath15 where @xmath16 denote directions in the celestial sphere , @xmath17 are legendre polynomials of multipole number @xmath18 .",
    "the spectrum , i.e. @xmath19 , depends on    * the universe evolution , * a primary spectrum of inhomogeneity , and * the propagation of inhomogeneity during the evolution .",
    "then , the universe evolution is well described by @xmath12cmd @xcite and it can be extrapolated to the age of universe , when the snapshot of cmbr was done , i.e about 380 thousands years after the big bang .",
    "the primary spectrum of inhomogeneity is suggested to be close to the harison ",
    "zeldovich distribution of so called `` no - scale '' limit at a spectral index @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a contrast of energy density at comoving coordinate , @xmath23 is a wave vector conjugated to the comoving coordinate , @xmath24 stands for an amplitude at a reference value of @xmath25 .",
    "the spectral index and amplitude are subjects to fit the observed spectrum of @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the propagation of inhomogeneity includes the sound and further smearing of waves by the gravitation .",
    "the concordance model of cosmology in the framework of general relativity well fits @xmath19 with the flat space and tuned amount of dark components @xcite : relative fractions of dark matter @xmath26% and dark energy in the approximation of cosmological constant @xmath27% .",
    "the baryonic matter composes only @xmath28% .",
    "this value is dictated by heights of distinct initial three acoustic peaks in the multipole spectrum , @xmath19 .",
    "that is the dark matter fraction , which regulates the relative heights and positions of peaks up to small variations due to the parameters of primary spectrum of inhomogeneity .",
    "next , the amount of baryonic matter and the temperature of cmbr fixes the baryon - to - photon ratio of densities @xmath29 , that is the only free parameter in calculation of elements abundance during the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "the current state of measurements of elements abundance extrapolated to the primary abundance is compatible with @xmath30 extracted from the @xmath12cdm fit of cmbr anisotropy @xcite .",
    "thus , the success of concordance model stimulates direct searches for an appropriate heavy dark matter particle at colliders and underground big - volume experiments , sensitive to suppressed , but non - zero cross sections of dark matter interaction with the ordinary matter .",
    "however , even a discovery of candidate for the dark matter particle would not withdraw the problem of ad hoc tuning of dark sector .",
    "moreover , it would sharpen the need to search for the dynamical reasons causing the adjustment of dark matter , i.e to look beyond the general relativity .",
    "a model of gravity involving the critical acceleration should naturally include both empirical laws such as the tully - fisher relation at the galactic scales and correct descriptions of universe evolution , observed features of cmbr , large scale structure and elements abundance , so that the model would give a successful approach being alternative to the general relativity in cosmology , of course . at galactic scales ,",
    "m. milgrom invented the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite stating the gravitational acceleration @xmath31 @xmath32 where the critical acceleration extracted from the modern analysis of rotational curves is given by @xmath33 @xcite , while @xmath34 denotes the newtonian gravitational potential of ordinary matter , satisfying @xmath35 . at @xmath36",
    ", we get the newtonian limit of gravitational force , while at @xmath37 the tully - fisher law is satisfied by construction .",
    "note that ( [ milg ] ) successfully predicts the rotational curves by the given distribution of visible matter with appropriate imprints of its features , see review in @xcite .",
    "however , the straightforward insertion of ( [ milg ] ) into the dynamics at cosmological scales would results in an inconsistent distortion of vacuum homogeneity during the evolution of universe , for instance , i.e. in the vacuum instability as was shown in @xcite , wherein authors offered to introduce the cosmological behavior of critical acceleration in the form of @xmath38 where the distance is determined by comoving coordinate @xmath39 and scale factor of universe expansion @xmath40 , so that @xmath41 . then , the homogeneous cosmology with the gravity law modified at accelerations below the critical value of @xmath0 is consistent , that constitutes the cosmological extrapolation of mond @xcite .",
    "the cosmological regime is matched to mond at a size of large scale structure @xmath42 , i.e. at the characteristic scale of inhomogeneity , that is related to the acoustic scale and sound horizon in the baryon - electron - photon plasma ( see details in @xcite ) .    in the framework of cosmological extrapolation of mond with the interpolation function @xmath43 in ( [ milg ] )",
    "the gravity equations for the evolution of homogeneous and isotropic universe can be written in the form @xcite @xmath44 in terms of ricci tensor @xmath45 for the metric @xmath46 and 4-vector in the direction of cosmological time @xmath47 , wherein the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath48 defines @xmath49=8\\pi g \\left(t_\\mu^\\nu-\\textstyle{\\frac12 } \\eta_\\mu^\\nu      t\\right),\\ ] ] while the extra tensor of curvature @xmath50 is the ricci tensor of de sitter space - time being both homogeneous in time and space as well as isotropic @xmath51 in addition to ( [ mg1 ] ) the conservation of energy - momentum @xmath52 is hold , of course .",
    "then , in the limit of general relativity we put @xmath53 , and we find @xmath54 , that results in the einstein equations @xmath55 in the limit of @xmath56 we get the modified evolution of universe , effective at present .",
    "it is important that parameterizing the size of large scale structure by @xmath57 at @xmath58 and moderate value of @xmath59 , we find the simplest solution for the coincidence problem , because the milgrom acceleration @xmath60 becomes close to the scale of cosmological constant @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , we will see that the dark matter fraction of energy is also regulated by the value of @xmath62 .",
    "( [ mg1 ] ) successfully fits the evolution of universe measured by observing the brightness of type ia supernovae versus the red shift @xcite .",
    "so , the stellar magnitude @xmath63 depends on the photometric distance @xmath64 ( in mpc ) , determined by the hubble constant evolution @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is an absolute stellar magnitude of light source at the distance of 10 pc .",
    "we show the hubble diagram for the type ia supernovae in fig .",
    "the mean deviation squared per degree of freedom gives @xmath68 for our fit with the following assignment of parameters : @xmath69 where @xmath70 determines the deceleration parameter at red sift @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 stands for the red shift , when the acceleration is equal to zero , @xmath74 parameterizes the hubble rate at @xmath71 via @xmath75 . accepting the prescription of @xmath76 we can find that @xmath77 when the energy density determined by the cosmological constant , is given by the energy budget of universe , @xmath78 . the same values of deceleration , @xmath70 , and red shift of transition from the deceleration to acceleration , @xmath73 , could be obtained in concordance model of @xmath12cdmcdm parameters are marked by bars .",

    "the problem is that such the modification of perturbation transfer function is not linear , and the appropriate machinery of calculation is not yet developed .",
    "that is missing point of our consideration , of course .",
    "nevertheless , the extensive usages of tool have shown that the influence of dark matter on the spectrum is reduced to relative enhancement of third peak , whereas this enhancement is due to enforcing the gravity .",
    "so , since the modified gravity produces the very similar effect of enforcing the gravity , we can expect that it could results in the same fine feature as concerns for the enlarging the third peak .    in this respect",

    "thus , we need the development of procedure to calculate the transfer function of inhomogeneity versus the red shift @xcite in the case of nonlinear mond .",
    "the same is true as concerns for the simulation of large scale structure formation visible at present time .",

    "the enhanced value of baryon fraction in the energy budget , @xmath132 implies the enhanced value of baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath30 being the only free parameter of bbn calculation @xcite .",
    "the bbn takes place during the period when the deviations from the general relativity are negligible .",
    "therefore , the primary abundance of light elements in cosmological extrapolation of mond should differ from the bbn estimated within the concordance model of @xmath12cdm .    at present the data on the helium abundance",
    "has large uncertainties which are compatible with both models under consideration . then , the deuterium and lithium primary abundances are clearly able to discriminate between the enhanced value of @xmath30 and its concordance value . however , these quantities are not measured directly , they are extrapolations from a suggested model of evolution .    indeed , we observe the visible sources of light , that mean the primary matter is contracted in stars with further development of nuclear reactions , and a model of star evolution has to reproduce the primary values of abundances . in this respect , one has to take into account the different red shifts of star formation , i.e. different ages of luminous objects , as considered in the framework of general relativity or mond , of course .",

    "the fast running probably indicates the need to improve the calculation tool in order to include higher derivatives of spectral index with respect to logarithm of wave vector .",
    "the spectral index of primary inhomogeneity define initial conditions for the transfer of inhomogeneity during the evolution , which can be observed in baryonic acoustic oscillations in large scale structure of present universe @xcite .",
    "the procedure of calculating the transfer function in the framework of modified gravity with the critical acceleration is nonlinear , and it is not still developed , that does not allow us to make a comparison with data , at present .",
    "the structure growth is enhanced in mond , and it can probably need for additional mechanism of smearing the acoustic oscillations @xcite .",
    "4 .   the modified gravity in our version results in doubly enhanced fraction of baryons , approximately .",
    "this means that baryon - to - photon ratio is twice large , at least .",
    "* more reliable estimates of primary _ abundance of light elements _ is required in order to _ discriminate _ the general relativity from the modified gravity by the big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "therefore , _",
    "bbn _ can give the _ falsification _ of cosmological extrapolation of mond .",
    "* the doubling of baryons in the form of cold baryonic matter ( jupiter - like objects , for instance ) should be found in observations .",
    "for instance , the mass deficit in galaxy clusters described within mond , can signalize on the appropriate enhancement of baryons .",
    "the multipole spectrum of cmbr anisotropy needs improvements of accuracy in the range of third acoustic peak .",
    "if the model of modified gravity will still miss the correct description of third peak after such the improvement , then this would point to the extension of simplest consideration by strict inclusion of inhomogeneity propagation within the modified dynamics .",
    "finally , we have shown that the coincidence problem of general relativity is inherently solved in the framework of cosmological extrapolation of mond : the critical acceleration is connected to the extra ricci tensor of de sitter space , involved in the gravity equations ; then , it is naturally correlates with the cosmological constant .",
    "in addition , the modified gravity is mostly effective at zero acceleration of universe expansion .",
    "that is why the coincidence notion is actual at present .    keeping in mind soluble problems mentioned , we state that the cosmological extrapolation of mond is quite successful in cosmology . moreover , we can falsify it in the nearest future , although the same note on the verification is actual for the general relativity , too .",
