    "after the invention of general relativity , through 100 years , a lot of verification tests have been done and it passed all of them starting from weak field solar system tests until the recent great discovery of gravitational waves from a binary black hole system@xcite .",
    "then , we have entered into the next 100 years for the challenge to the discovery of an edge of general relativity .",
    "binary pulsar systems , such as the hulse - taylor binary@xcite , have been used to test the gravitational theories in the region with a strong gravitational field compared to the solar system observations .",
    "black hole ( bh)-pulsar systems can be also powerful tools for testing the theories , and the pulsar can be used as a unique probe for the environment around a bh .",
    "future prospects for gravity tests with pulsar - black hole binaries are discussed in detail in ref .",
    "while they have not been found yet , there are indirect evidences of the existence of bh - pulsar systems in our galaxy@xcite .",
    "one promising system is a pulsar orbiting around @xmath2 bh .",
    "recent simulations indicate that 200 pulsars exist within 4000  au from @xmath2 and the closest one probably has semi - major axis 120 au@xcite . in this paper , taking a pulsar orbiting around @xmath2 bh into consideration , we propose an approach to test gravity around a bh with two phenomenological parameters which characterize deviation from the vacuum einstein gravity .",
    "our phenomenological parameters are different from conventional ones , which are used , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the post - newtonian(pn ) approximation is still valid for pulsar motion with semi - major axis 120 au , we rely on the pn formalism throughout this paper .",
    "the parametrized post - newtonian(ppn ) formalism is an extension of the pn formalism , and the most popular phenomenological approach for testing gravitational theories .",
    "this formalism contains ten free parameters , ppn parameters , which appear as coefficients of potentials in the metric and represent deviation from general relativity(gr ) .",
    "observational constraints on these parameters are summarized in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if deviation from gr is found in the ppn framework , it may support modified gravitational theories . however , in the ppn framework",
    ", since matter effects are not usually taken into account , one may suspect a possible matter effect .",
    "then , the story of the vulcan might be repeated not for the solar system but for our galactic center .",
    "possibility of unknown matter effects might not be excluded using the ppn framework alone . therefore , as a complement to the ppn framework , we introduce phenomenological parameters to see how it deviates from the vacuum case .    in a phenomenological point of view , we do not necessarily persist in ordinary healthy matters .",
    "as in the case of the dark energy problem in cosmology , an energy component with an exotic equation of state could play a crucial role to explain an actual phenomenon even if its origin is not revealed . in the case of the dark energy problem",
    ", there are a lot of attempts to explain the accelerated expansion of our universe by using modified gravity theories instead of introducing an extra - ordinary matter component . in other words ,",
    "the evidence of the exotic equation of state might imply modification of the gravitational theory rather than the existence of the exotic matter field .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to consider a relativistic exotic matter component around a bh with gr to be valid . for this purpose , differently from the conventional pn formalism , we keep our formalism general enough so that relativistic matter components can be treated . in analogy with the dark energy problem",
    ", we introduce an extra - ordinary matter field with the equation of state @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pressure and energy density , respectively and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "it should be noted that , although we introduce the extra - ordinary matter component in analogy with the dark energy , it is not necessarily identical to the dark energy , which causes the accelerated expansion of our universe . @xmath5 and @xmath6 should be regarded as purely phenomenological parameters which characterize deviation of the geometry from the kerr bh .",
    "pulsars orbiting around @xmath2 bh can be treated as test particles .",
    "therefore we focus on geodesic motion in the spacetime described by the pn approximation . in the conventional pn scheme",
    ", the mass density of a fluid contributes to the newtonian order while the pressure does only to pn orders .",
    "however , as is mentioned above , we also consider relativistic fluid , in which the mass density and the pressure may contribute to the geometry at the same order .",
    "we introduce the fluid component as a small perturbation from the vacuum einstein theory .",
    "thus , the mass density and the pressure of the fluid are assumed to equally make only post - newtonian contributions .",
    "this prescription enable us to describe the geodesic motion around a bh with a surrounding relativistic fluid .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : metric ] we derive the pn metric in the situation of our interest . in sec .",
    "[ sec : geodesic ] , we focus on the geodesic equation and show the difference from it without a fluid component . we give an estimate of the effect of the surrounding fluid to the pericenter shift in sec .",
    "[ sec : pericenter ] .",
    "[ sec : sandd ] is devoted to a summary and discussion .    in this paper",
    ", the speed of light and the newton s gravitational constant are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "in this section , we derive the metric of spherically symmetric system composed of a bh and a surrounding matter component .",
    "the einstein equations are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ricci tensor and scalar , respectively , @xmath12 is the spacetime metric and @xmath13 is the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "we consider a central bh and the static spherically symmetric perfect fluid distribution having the energy - momentum tensor @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath4 are the mass density and the pressure , respectively , and @xmath16 is the four velocity of the fluid element .",
    "hereafter , we use a cartesian coordinate system given by @xmath17 or @xmath18 , and @xmath19 . in this notation",
    ", the four velocity can be described by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is determined by the normalization condition : @xmath22 .",
    "since we perform pn expansion , in our approximation , the matter density can be described as follows : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mass of bh and @xmath26 is the determinant of the metric @xmath27 , and @xmath5 is the surrounding fluid energy density .",
    "the equation of state of the surrounding fluid is assumed to be @xmath3 , where @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "it should be noted that , in a phenomenological point of view , global distribution of the fluid is not necessarily needed but local distribution near the pulsar trajectory may be enough .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we regard the equation of state as an approximate one valid only near the pulsar trajectory",
    ". then , we do not take the global distribution into account .",
    "let us introduce expansion parameters .",
    "in the situation of our interest , a pn expansion parameter @xmath28 can be defined by @xmath29 where @xmath11 is the reference radius given by a characteristic distance scale of the test particle orbit .",
    "we introduce another expansion parameter defined by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy density of the matter at the radius @xmath11 from the bh .",
    "we consider that the surrounding fluid is sparse enough for @xmath32 to be regarded as a small quantity . since we have two expansion parameters , for convenience , we introduce the following notation @xmath33 which denotes higher order terms of @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "we consider the geodesic equation up to the order of @xmath36 compared to the newtonian order .",
    "there is no order @xmath37 term in the geodesic equation .",
    "although the order @xmath38 terms give usual 2pn contributions , for simplicity , we neglect them by assuming @xmath39 in this paper",
    ". the order @xmath38 terms can be trivially introduced , and then our approach can be extended to the case @xmath40 . in summary , we neglect @xmath41 terms in the geodesic equation .    following the method given in ref .",
    "@xcite , neglecting the terms proportional to @xmath42 in @xmath43 and @xmath44 in @xmath45 , we obtain the following expressions for a spherically symmetric static near - zone metric in the standard harmonic gauge : @xmath46+\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^{2}),\\\\ g_{0j}&=0,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 here , the region of integral is the spatial region occupied by the fluid and @xmath48 is an arbitrary function .    decomposing the potential into the bh and fluid parts and using the equation of state for the fluid , we obtain @xmath49+\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^{2},\\alpha^2 ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the newtonian potentials of the bh and the fluid are given by @xmath50 we set @xmath51 using the regularization prescription : @xmath52@xcite , which is a special case of the hadamard regularization .",
    "this prescription yields the same outer metric as that with treating the bh as a finite size object .    for later convenience",
    ", we consider the following coordinate transformation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a constant , which will be determined later .",
    "the metric after the transformation is @xmath55+\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^{2},\\alpha^2 ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally we determine the distribution of the perfect fluid by solving the euler equation . in our case , it leads to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation : @xmath56 solving the equation with the boundary condition @xmath57 , we obtain @xmath58 we find that this solution is nonzero at spatial infinity unless @xmath59 .",
    "the near zone metric can not be defined for the fluid not having a compact support . however , as is mentioned before , since we consider the equation of state @xmath3 is approximately valid only in the vicinity of the test particle orbit , we do not care about the distribution beyond the region of our interest . furthermore , due to the spherical symmetry , the motion of a test particle is independent of the distribution outside the orbit .",
    "we see this fact in the next section . for the same reason , we do not care about the singular behaviour of @xmath5 for @xmath60 in this paper . in this viewpoint",
    ", the parameters @xmath31 and @xmath6 should be regarded as just phenomenological parameters which characterize the deviation of the local geometry from the vacuum gr case .",
    "it is worthy to note that , even if we consider these parameters are not really matter effects but effective description of some modified gravity theory , since the effective energy momentum tensor must be equal to the einstein tensor , it must be compatible with the bianchi identity",
    ". therefore , the hydrostatic equilibrium condition must be , at least locally , imposed in any case .",

    "and we get @xmath71 for this choice of @xmath54 , the geodesic equation is independent of @xmath72 , which means the motion of a test particle is not affected by the distribution of the fluid outside the orbit as mentioned before .    introducing the dimensionless quantities , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath76 -\\alpha ( 1 + 3w ) \\bar{r } \\bm{n } \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\alpha \\epsilon \\big [ \\big\\{\\frac{3}{2}(1 + 3w)\\frac{1+w}{w}+1-w\\big\\ } \\bm{n } -(1 + 3w)\\frac{1+w}{w } \\bar{r } \\bm{n } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\hspace{35 mm } + ( 1-w ) \\bar{v}^2   \\bar{r }   \\bm{n } -4(1+w)(\\bar{\\bm{v } } \\cdot \\bm{n } ) \\bar{r } \\bar{\\bm{v } } \\big ] + \\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^2,\\alpha^2 ) .",

    "let us consider how the orbital radius and phase deviate from the vacuum gr case . in our setting , the orbital motion is restricted within a fixed orbital plane as in the keplerian case . the 1pn term and the terms proportional to @xmath32 in the geodesic equation cause deviation from the keplerian motion .",
