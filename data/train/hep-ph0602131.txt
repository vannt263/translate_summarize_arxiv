    "we also note that longitudinal beam polarization can increase @xmath358 significantly , although the very small size of this effective asymmetry for our `` default '' parameters and transversely polarized beams ( top left frame ) is clearly accidental .",
    "last but not least , we have checked numerically the effect of varying the left  handed selectron mass @xmath364 on the cp  odd asymmetries .",
    "the transverse decay asymmetries , with transversely polarized beams , are sensitive to the mass ; in fact , they get a bit bigger with smaller mass values .",
    "nevertheless , we have noted that the longitudinal asymmetry for unpolarized beams becomes much bigger when the left  handed selectron mass is reduced .",
    "for example , taking parameters as in the top  left frame in fig.[fig5 ] , except for a reduced @xmath365 gev , the maximal value of @xmath366 after cuts increases to about 1.2 fb@xmath367 , whereas the maximum of @xmath368 reaches about 2.2 fb@xmath367 . we emphasize that we do not actually need any beam polarization to probe this asymmetry , although it can be increased significantly by using longitudinal polarized beams ; for reduced @xmath362 mass , taking left  handed @xmath45 and right  handed @xmath46 beams is often optimal . therefore , reducing the left ",
    "handed selectron mass does not affect the ordering of @xmath369 and @xmath370 , i.e. the inequality @xmath371 ( for optimized choice of longitudinal beam polarization . )",
    "in this paper we studied the production of neutralino pairs at future linear @xmath1 colliders , with subsequent two  body decays of the heavier neutralinos .",
    "we found that decays of the type @xmath372 are not sensitive to the @xmath373 polarization , unless one can measure the polarization of the @xmath374boson ( or that of the final  state neutralino @xmath47 ) .",
    "these decays can therefore only be used to probe cp violation in neutralino _",
    "production_. unfortunately the corresponding cp ",
    "odd term suffers from cancelations between @xmath277 and @xmath278channel diagrams , and is nonzero only in the presence of higgsino  gaugino mixing . as a result",
    ", measuring this asymmetry , which can be done only with transversely polarized @xmath69 beams , will be very difficult , if not impossible , with the currently foreseen linear collider performance .",
    "in contrast , @xmath134 decays into a slepton plus a lepton allows to probe the @xmath134 polarization state , thereby opening up the possibility to construct several decay asymmetries .",
    "moreover , this decay , followed by subsequent @xmath375 decays , allows to reconstruct even the simplest neutralino pair events , @xmath376 production with invisible ( e.g. , stable ) @xmath377 , with two or four  fold ambiguity . under favorable circumstances experiments at a collider with ( sufficiently strongly ) transversely polarized beams should then be able to determine non  vanishing asymmetries with high statistical significance .",
    "however , even in this case a different asymmetry , which does not depend on transverse beam polarization ( but can be maximized using longitudinal beam polarization ) , is generally larger in size than even the best of the transverse decay asymmetries we studied .",
    "we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] that this is true both for gaugino and higgsino  like @xmath35 .",
    "it also remains true when we vary the ratio @xmath378 , in particular for @xmath379 .",
    "however , if @xmath380 , or if both produced neutralinos are higgsino  like , all cp  odd asymmetries become small .",
    "recall that in the mssm all these asymmetries essentially result from a single ( potentially large ) phase , associated with the u(1 ) gaugino mass ( in the convention where the su(2 ) gaugino mass is real and positive ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that , _ at least _ in the context of neutralino production in the mssm , transverse beam polarization is not particularly useful in probing explicit cp violation . once the relevant masses have been determined , the most sensitive probe of the relevant cp ",
    "odd phases remains the total cross section @xcite , although it is a cp  even observable .",
    "if this measurement indicates that some phase differs from 0 or @xmath308 , one needs to see explicit cp violation , in order to convince oneself that the variation of the cross section is indeed due to a phase , rather than due to some extension of the mssm .",
    "however , as noted above , this can be most easily accomplished by using longitudinal , rather than transverse , beam polarization .",
    "the situation might be different in extensions of the mssm , however .",
    "whenever the quartic charges @xmath106 and @xmath381 defined in sec .",
    "2.2 contain ( combinations of ) phases that are independent of those in @xmath147 and @xmath382 , the option of transverse beam polarization might be very useful for determining these phases . in the nmssm ,",
    "for example , the neutralino mass matrix contains additional cp ",
    "odd phases associated with the singlino sector , which can be large . a dedicated analysis along the lines presented in this paper",
