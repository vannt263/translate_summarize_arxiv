    "a number of investigations aimed to check absolute stability of half - life of different radioactive isotopes and to search for possible time variations of the half - life constants under action of known and possible unknown natural factors has been carried out during last years .    in work @xcite it was shown that , after many years of investigations with scintillation and semi - conductor @xmath2-ray detectors , a conclusion was made about changes of rate of radioactive elements @xmath3-decay with 24 hours and 27 days periodicities .",
    "many years measurement s decay rates data for the @xmath4si ( @xmath3-decay ) measured in the brookhaven national laboratory ( usa , 1982 - 1986 years ) and for the @xmath5ra ( @xmath6 and @xmath3-decays ) measured in the physikalisch - technische - bundesanstalt ( germany , 1983 - 1998 years ) were analyzed in work @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "decay rate variations with a one year period and maximum amplitude of @xmath70.15% in january - february were found in both data sets .",
    "the authors considered an assumed seasonal variations of the detector systems characteristics and/or the direct annular modulation of the count rate being caused by some unknown factor depending on the sun - earth distance as possible causes of such count rate variations .",
    "the weak point of the count rate long time monitor experiments is a possible influence of meteorological , climatic and geophysical factors on the count rate of a source - detector pair",
    ". this shortcoming could be practically totally avoided in measurements based on a direct registration of a nuclear life time between birth and decay .",
    "such a method allows us to answer the question of possible change with time of a just nuclear decay constant .    besides that a direct registration of nuclear life time allows us to study of the exponentially decay low . some theoretical models",
    "@xcite , @xcite predicted that decay curve does not exactly follow an exponential low in the short - and long - time regions in particular due to of the so - called quantum zeno effect @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "experimentally zeno effect was proved @xcite in repeatedly measured two - level system undergoing rabi transitions , but not observed in spontaneous decays .",
    "very important condition for measure possible deviations from an exponential low is the all investigated nuclei could have the same age .",
