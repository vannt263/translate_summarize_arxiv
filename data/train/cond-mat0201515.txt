    "we found no chain monomers in the vicinity of the colloid surface , hence unambiguously found monomer desorption from the colloidal surface .    concerning the intra - chain monomer ordering for @xmath48 , fig .",
    "[ fig.pr_nr_qr_eps80](b ) shows that , although the chain conformation is relatively dense , there is only one main peak in the monomer @xmath63 profile ( the second peak is marginal ) .",
    "this proves that there is no strong intra - chain monomer ordering ( in the normal direction to the macroion sphere ) in this weak coulomb coupling in contrast with our observations at @xmath64 [ compare with fig . [ fig.pr_nr_qr_eps40](b ) ] .",

    "it is found that @xmath70 increases almost linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "this result fits well with the scaling theory in this regime from ref.@xcite where it is found that the chain extension shrinks proportionally with @xmath72 , and we can assume for our purposes @xmath73 . because the electrostatic interactions are weaker in the present case ( @xmath46 ) , the ion pair ( monomer - condensed counterion ) attractions are weaker which results in a higher @xmath70 value ( at fixed @xmath71 ) than in the strong coulomb coupling regime .",
    "our last result concerns the monovalent case ( @xmath75 and @xmath48 ) corresponding to run @xmath76 ( see table [ tab.runs ] ) .",
    "in this situation we have a strong macroion - polyelectrolyte repulsion , and one can not get like - charge complexation .",
    "we have carried out md simulations to study the complexation of a charged colloid with a charged polyelectrolyte of the same charge for various coulomb couplings @xmath72 and and varying charge fraction @xmath77 .",
    "a complementary view of the observed conformations is to regard both macroions as being neutralized by their counterions the isolated chain would then collapse into a globule , and the colloid would be regularly covered by its counterions . by changing the bjerrum length @xmath72 we change the correlations between the charges which lead in a first approximation to attractions of dipolar origin , and the attraction is roughly proportional to @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",
    "by varying @xmath77 we change the number of counterions of the chain , hence the number of available dipoles .",
    "for @xmath74 we can regard the colloidal particle as exerting only a perturbation of the chain complex ( which has a higher density of dipoles ) .",
    "for largest @xmath72 the strong attraction results in a flat disk , for weaker @xmath72 the disk swells back into the bulk structure , the globule . for smaller",
    "@xmath77 the number of counterions of the polyelectrolyte and the colloid become comparable in number , and both macroions can equally compete for the counterions leading to a greater freedom of both macroions to `` move '' in their common counterion cloud . for the largest value of @xmath72 we have again the strongest dipolar attractions leading to a purely 2d conformation , where the chain is wrapped around the colloid . for smaller values of @xmath72",
    "the conformations become more and more 3d - like , but are still wrapping around the colloid . of special interest",
    "is here the fact that even for a coupling strength which is typically for an aqueous solvent ( @xmath72 = 7.1  ) we find that like - charge complexation still occurs provided the linear charge density is sufficiently large .",
    "however the adsorption of the polymer chain onto the colloid is weaker than in the larger coulomb coupling regimes . for @xmath79 ,",
    "we observe formation of large loops .",
    "this argument assumes that the ions ( charged monomers + condensed conterions ) distribution along the chain is uniform .",
    "this should be relatively well satisfied since the bare charged monomers are already uniformly distributed ."
