    "thermopower ( @xmath5 ) of ce - based kondo lattice systems ( kls ) exhibits a variety of unusual features depending on the coupling strength ( @xmath6 ) between ce-4@xmath7 and conduction electrons , which is of both fundamental and application interests @xcite .",
    "particularly , as @xmath6 is enhanced by external pressure ( @xmath8 ) , typical features in @xmath9 from kondo to intermediate - valence ( iv ) regime can be observed even in a single compound , examples of which include cecu@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , ceal@xmath10 @xcite , cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 @xcite , cepd@xmath0si@xmath0 @xcite , cecu@xmath0 @xcite , ceru@xmath0ge@xmath0",
    "@xcite . at @xmath8 = 0 ,",
    "@xmath9 of these materials displays a positive maximum at high @xmath1 but a negative minimum at low @xmath1 .",
    "the increase of @xmath8 tends to upshift the whole @xmath9 curve . once @xmath6 becomes large enough for ce to be in an iv state , one broad positive @xmath9 maximum of the order of @xmath11/@xmath12 (= 87 @xmath13v / k ) persists , often with a shoulder at low @xmath1 @xcite . theoretically ,",
    "while at high and intermediate @xmath1 the @xmath5 behavior is understood as resulting from the interplay between kondo and crystal field ( cf ) effects @xcite , the low-@xmath1 negative @xmath5 remains mysterious .",
    "however , since in the aforementioned cases the long - range magnetic order ( if any ) disappears at @xmath8 @xmath14 8 gpa @xcite , the way in which @xmath9 evolves with @xmath8 remains largely unexplored for weak kondo coupling ( small @xmath6 ) regime . in this context",
    ", it is worth noting that we recently found a giant overlap in @xmath8 between the magnetic and superconducting phases of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 , which contrasts radically with the observations made on its sister compounds cecu@xmath0@xmath15@xmath0 ( @xmath15 = si , ge ) @xcite .",
    "strikingly , the magnetic order of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 persists up to @xmath3 @xmath4 22 gpa @xcite , which , together with the small magnitude of @xmath16@xmath5@xmath16 ( @xmath42 @xmath13v / k ) @xcite , places the compound far from magnetic instabilities .",
    "thus , the high-@xmath8 @xmath5(@xmath1 ) measurement of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 allows not only to look for possible differences with the normal - state properties of cecu@xmath0@xmath15@xmath0 , but also offers a rare opportunity to study the @xmath8-evolution of the characteristic features in @xmath5(@xmath1 ) starting from a small @xmath6 .    in this paper",

    "another salient feature illustrated in fig .",

    "a very similar situation is found when @xmath9/@xmath1 is concerned @xcite . actually , as suggested in fig .",

    "finally , it should be noted that substantial differences exist between the normal - state properties of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 and cecu@xmath0@xmath73 despite their similarities @xcite . in particular ,",
    "regardless its smaller overall @xmath21 , @xmath2 of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 ( @xmath4120 - 150 k ) is almost twice that of cecu@xmath0@xmath73 ( @xmath440 - 80 k ) .",
    "moreover , the low-@xmath22 of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 in comparison with cecu@xmath0ge@xmath0 suggests a longer mean free path , which is more favorable for unconventional sc @xcite .",
    "given that the interaction leading to the negative @xmath9 may also be involved in the superconducting pairing , these factors could be the key to understanding the exotic ground - state properties of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 under @xmath8 .",
    "in summary , we have studied systematically the high-@xmath8 thermopower and resistivity of ceau@xmath0si@xmath0 up to 27.8 gpa . for the first time , a scaling behavior is found in the @xmath9 data below 20.5 gpa as a function of a reduced temperature @xmath1/@xmath2 .",
    "the comparison with @xmath17 results shows that the @xmath9 magnitude is determined by the kondo coupling @xmath6 , while the cf splitting @xmath21 controls the characteristic temperatures of the sign change ( @xmath2 ) and the negative minimum ( @xmath44 ) . up to almost @xmath3 , a large negative @xmath9 minimum regularly precedes the superconducting transition , suggesting that the two phenomena are closely related .",
    "furthermore , the scaling relation is shown to hold up to 2@xmath2 for @xmath5(@xmath1 ) at ambient @xmath8 of related systems with diverse crystal structures , testifying to its wide applicability .",
    "our work demonstrates that thermopower can be useful in probing the @xmath8-evolution of cf energy scale in ce - based kls , but should be used with caution in estimating the @xmath43 of these materials .",
    "this calls for new theoretical understandings .",

    "the slope @xmath32 can be traced up to 16.7 gpa . at higher @xmath8 ,",
    "the analysis is not pertinent due to the interference of the two @xmath17 maxima .",
    "the determination of @xmath33 is limited to @xmath8 below 20.5 gpa since at higher @xmath8 the @xmath20ln@xmath1 slope is expected at @xmath1 @xmath40 300 k.          at low @xmath1 , where the @xmath34 contribution is negligible , the measured @xmath5 can be approximated as @xmath5 @xmath23 @xmath74@xmath71/(@xmath74 + @xmath22 ) , where @xmath74 and @xmath71 are the magnetic resistivity and magnetic thermopower , respectively .",

    "= 0 , the obtained @xmath43 @xmath4 2@xmath6710@xmath75 k seems too small , suggesting that the actual @xmath6 increases less rapidly than assumed in the calculation .",

    "_ @xcite .          according to @xcite , three -ln@xmath1 slopes",
    "@xmath39 ( @xmath42 = 1 , 2 , 3 ) are expected for two well - separated excited cf levels and the ratio of @xmath77/@xmath32 = 35/3 , while @xmath77/@xmath33 = 7/3 , the latter being close to the observed value .",
    "hence a possible scenario is that @xmath32 is masked by the magnetic ordering or the coherence effect .",
