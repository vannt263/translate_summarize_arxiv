    "amartya sen @xcite argues that famine and other catastrophes are easily avoided in a democracy .",
    "this argument relies on the fact that where information can freely diffuse , decision makers can form an unbiased picture of the state of a society , and take proper measures .",
    "biases due to individual opinions are expected to be washed out in the information aggregation process , a phenomenon often referred to as the `` wisdom of crowds '' @xcite .",
    "still , cases of information aggregation failure abound even in democratic societies .",
    "for example , in the aftermath of the 2008 lehman brothers bankruptcy , former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan expressed his state of `` shocked disbelief '' during his hearing before the us committee of government oversight and reform , leaving the public opinion to wonder where did he get the information the policy of the fed was based on .",
    "al gore @xcite argues that shortcuts between decision makers and the media are often such that the former are not in the best position to be informed about what is going on .",
    "a number of models on social dynamics have addressed the issue of information aggregation ( see e.g. @xcite for an excellent review ) .",
    "the simplest is probably the voter model , which entails agents taking the same opinion of a randomly chosen node amongst their neighbors .",
    "this allows for sharp predictions @xcite where generally the information aggregation process converges to the incorrect outcome with finite probability .",
    "other contributions have instead proposed different opinion dynamics mechanisms , such as majority rules @xcite or social impact models @xcite , which support different conclusions .",
    "these models , however , come short in their micro - economic foundation , as the interaction mechanism is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "more detailed micro - economic models of social learning have been proposed in the economics literature .",
    "it is well known that information aggregation may fail when agents free ride on the information gathered by others , without seeking independent sources .",
    "this phenomenon , called rational herding @xcite , is also supported by experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "a sequel of papers have focused on bayesian learning schemes @xcite , coming to the generic conclusion that when agents update their beliefs following bayes rule society correctly aggregates information ( still see @xcite ) .",
    "some authors have focused on the impact of dominant groups of individuals on the aggregation of information .",
    "for example , bala and goyal @xcite introduced the notion of `` royal family '' as a group of agents whose behavior is observed by anyone else . alternatively , golub and jackson @xcite defined @xmath0-step `` prominent groups '' as those groups whose behavior eventually influences all other agents within time @xmath0 .",
    "regardless of the specific definitions , these and other studies unanimously highlighted the negative role that exceedingly influential groups have on the information aggregation process .",
    "in this paper we focus on an extremely stylized model of a society and we address the issue of whether information distributed across the population is able to diffuse to an uniformed well connected clique of decision makers .",
    "our model assumes bayesian learning , but differently from @xcite , who study a continuum of agents , we study a finite but large population of agents connected by a social network . on a finite network , when agents talk repeatedly with their peers , they may not be able to disentangle what in their peer s opinion is new information and what reflects information exchanged in previous interactions , including the one provided by themselves to them .",
    "this phenomenon , called `` persuasion bias '' in @xcite , introduces a non - trivial positive feedback and leads to information aggregation failure , at odds with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "the main conclusions of our paper can be summarized in two points : _",
    "i ) _ information aggregation crucially depends on the synchronicity of the information updates of different agents : in the extreme case of a parallel update dynamics , where we can derive analytic results , information diffusion leads to the correct outcome in the limit of a very large society or for very informative initial signals .",
    "when the fraction of agents who update their beliefs at each time step is lower than a critical threshold , the society converges with finite probability to the wrong outcome , no matter how large the society is . _",
    "ii ) _ in the case of parallel dynamics , information aggregation _ degrades _ as the size of the clique of uninformed agents gets smaller .",
    "in particular , the limit of a vanishingly small clique of uninformed agents , behaves markedly differently from the case of a homogeneous society ( with no clique ) .",
    "both results suggests that it might not be wise to rely on crowds in situations which are reminiscent of those prevailing in our societies , where update is sequential and the social network is characterized by highly connected cliques ( news corporations , political parties ) .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in section [ dyn_topology ] we detail the network structure and the information update rules , as well as our quantitative measure of a social network s ability to correctly aggregate information . in section [ prob_computing ]",
    "we provide analytic results for the case of parallel information update . in section [ diff_dyn ]",
    "we numerically compare these results with those obtained in sequential update schemes .",
    "we conclude the paper with a few conclusive remarks in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , let us consider a population of agents who need to decide whether a certain event @xmath1 will occur ( @xmath2 ) or not ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "let us denote the prior probability of @xmath1 as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "as already stated , our interest is mainly focused on the information aggregation process as performed by societies where a fraction of individuals matters much more than the vast majority of the population . in the language of networks , the most obvious measure of the importance of a node",
    "is its degree , i.e. the number of neighbors . for this very reason , throughout the rest of the paper we shall focus on a highly stylized society structure , where only few nodes have a large degree , which we build starting from a connected regular graph where all @xmath6 nodes have degree @xmath7 .",
    "then , a randomly chosen set @xmath8 made of @xmath9 non - neighboring sites are connected among themselves , thus forming a clique of nodes with degree @xmath10 ( this construction is such that each hub has exactly @xmath11 links connecting it to nodes outside @xmath8 ) . in the following",
    ", we shall be mostly interested in the case @xmath12 , i.e. when @xmath8 becomes a group of mutually connected hubs .      at time @xmath13",
    ", each agent @xmath14 receives signals about event @xmath1 which are independently drawn from a probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "we assume these signals to be informative @xcite , i.e. @xmath16 @xmath17 , and we focus on the particular case @xmath18 on the other hand , the agents @xmath19  the leaders  are assumed to be initially uninformed .",
    "this means that their signals are independently drawn from a probability @xmath20 for @xmath21 .      in our model",
    ", agents repeatedly exchange information with their neighbors . in this exchange ,",
    "the generic agent @xmath22 collects a certain number @xmath23 of signals that we denote by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are the initial signals discussed above .",
    "given this information set @xmath26 , by bayes theorem @xcite , the agent s state of knowledge about @xmath1 is quantified by the conditional probability @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability of the signals @xmath26 .",
    "notice that the likelihood ratio of @xmath29 and @xmath30 does not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "if the agent believes that the different signals are independent , then @xmath31 and the logarithm of the likelihood ratio , which embodies the state of information of agent @xmath22 , can be described by a single variable @xmath32 : @xmath33    at @xmath34 , agents have just one signal .",
    "then we have @xmath35 and the above expression reduces to the very compact form @xmath36    when two agents , say @xmath22 and @xmath37 with signals @xmath26 and @xmath38 respectively , meet , they communicate by exchanging signals and , as a result , their state of knowledge changes . indeed , if @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "likewise , if @xmath41 , then @xmath42 .",
    "starting from an initial state of knowledge @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , one can think of different types of information update .",
    "our assumption will be that at each time step @xmath45 , a certain fraction @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 ) of randomly selected agents update their state of knowledge by _ listening _ to their neighbors .",
    "so , assuming that agents in the set @xmath48 are the ones to update their information at time @xmath0 , one has : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the @xmath51 element of the adjacency matrix @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath53 if agents @xmath22 and @xmath37 are connected and @xmath54 if they are not .",
    "clearly , the above dynamics has two limiting cases : @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the former describes cases where agents update their information one at a time , and we shall refer to this particular situation as random node sequential ( rns ) dynamics . the latter case , instead , describes a parallel dynamics where all agents simultaneously update their state of knowledge .",
    "this information update rule was initially proposed in @xcite , and , due to its analytical tractability , represents the most frequent choice in social learning models . in the following",
    ", we also shall investigate this type of dynamics , and then explore other cases in section [ diff_dyn ] .",
    "the dynamics in eq .",
    "( [ general_dyn ] ) is unbounded , i.e. each @xmath32 will either diverge to @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "thus , information aggregation properties can be assessed simply by looking at the signs of the @xmath32s in the long run .",
    "thus , a good measure of information aggregation is given by the `` magnetization '' of the system : @xmath59 the quantity @xmath60 tells what is the fraction of the population holding the right information on event @xmath1 at time @xmath0 . a quantitative measure of information aggregation is given by the probability @xmath61 that the majority will converge to the true outcome , in an ensemble of repeated trials .",
    "according to the parallel dynamics prescription , all agents in a social network listen to their neighbors at any time @xmath62 , and update their state of knowledge accordingly : @xmath63 by collecting all @xmath64s into a column vector @xmath65 the column vector with components @xmath66 , and by @xmath67 the corresponding row vector . ] , the dynamics described in equation can be rewritten as @xmath68 play a crucial role in the time evolution of the state of knowledge vector @xmath65 .",
    "being symmetric , the adjacency matrix @xmath69 yields @xmath6 real eigenvalues @xmath70 , whose corresponding eigenvectors @xmath71 ( @xmath44 ) form an orthogonal set in @xmath72 . by decomposing the adjacency matrix as @xmath73",
    ", one can see that , for large enough times , equation becomes @xmath74 , corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix @xmath69 , share the same sign , which we shall assume to be positive from now on .",
    "thus , in the light of the relation in , two main points become apparent :    * for large enough times @xmath65 is proportional to @xmath75 , meaning that all agents on the network either learn the correct value of @xmath1 or they all get it wrong .",
    "* the sign of the components in @xmath75 is completely determined by the sign of the overlap @xmath76 , so that the probability of the whole network learning the right information reads @xmath77    in the following we shall compute the probability for the simple network topology discussed above .    for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us assume @xmath2 , so that the probability in equation is equivalent to the probability of the scalar product @xmath78 being positive , and that each agent is initially given one signal @xmath79 at time @xmath13 .",
    "assuming that hubs , i.e. nodes in the clique @xmath8 , have no initial information ( @xmath80 for @xmath81 ) , such a scalar product can be written as a sum over the @xmath82 sites not belonging to @xmath8 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the @xmath22-th component of the first eigenvector , and @xmath85 ( see equation ) . a good approximation scheme to estimate the probability of the quantity in equation being positive is via the central limit theorem : as a matter of fact the scalar product in is the sum of @xmath82 random variables , each given by the product of two random variables : @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the probability of @xmath87 in equation being positive is approximately given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 denote the mean and standard deviation , respectively , of the random variable @xmath87 .",
    "given the independence of the @xmath32s and the eigenvector components @xmath84s , such two quantities are given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 denote the mean and standard deviation of the random variables @xmath32 , whereas @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the mean and standard deviation of the eigenvector components @xmath84 for @xmath14 .",
    "computing @xmath92 and @xmath93 is easy .",
    "recalling that signals must be informative ( see equation ) , one has @xmath96 .",
    "let us rewrite such probability as @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "then , one can immediately verify that @xmath99 as regards @xmath94 and @xmath95 , good approximate expressions for them can be computed by employing standard perturbation theory up to second order ( see appendix [ perturb ] for the details ) .",
    "to leading order in @xmath6 one gets : @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the fraction of hubs in the network . as can be seen from the inset in fig .",
    "[ ls ] , the above approximations are in excellent agreement with results obtained from numerical diagonalization of adjacency matrices , especially for large network sizes .",
    "plugging equations and into equation , one can eventually compute the probability of converging to the right value of event @xmath1 as in equation : @xmath102 as already stated , we are mostly interested in cases where only a few nodes in the network play the role of hubs , i.e. @xmath103 : in this case the probability in equation further simplifies to the following remarkably simple expression : @xmath104 in fig .",
    "[ ls ] the prediction by the above equation is compared with the results of numerical simulations for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and for several different system sizes @xmath6 : all results are in very good agreement with equation ( all data points are rescaled in order to collapse on the function @xmath107 ) .",
    "a few comments are in order on the approximate result of equation .",
    "since @xmath108 , according to equation for each system size @xmath6 correct information aggregation happens with probability that for all practical purposes can be considered equal to 1 when initial signals informativeness is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 .",
    "this point essentially means that for _ any _ population size @xmath6 correct information aggregation is possible , for informative enough initial signals , despite the presence of a fraction @xmath111 of dominant nodes .",
    "such a result shows that the presence of a group of individuals with large influence does not necessarily jeopardize correct information aggregation .",
    "moreover , the threshold value @xmath112 is inversely proportional to @xmath113 , meaning that large populations will be able to aggregate information correctly as soon as signals are informative , i.e. as soon as @xmath114 is slightly larger than @xmath115 .",
    "this is essentially a stronger statement of previous results obtained for infinite networks ( see for example @xcite ) , where the presence of signals with arbitrarily large informativeness , combined with the lack of individuals with unbounded influence , is identified as a sufficient condition for correct information aggregation . on the other hand , for @xmath116",
    "the population reaches consensus on the wrong value of @xmath1 with non - zero probability .    a very interesting role in the information aggregation process is played by the fraction of hubs @xmath111 . in fig .",
    "[ clt ] , one can see how , for a fixed system size @xmath6 , the probability of correct information aggregation behaves when increasing the fraction @xmath111 of hubs in the network .    also , it is rather interesting to compare such results with the information aggregation capabilities of a regular graph where all nodes have the same degree @xmath11 .",
    "in such a case , one can immediately verify that the first eigenvector of the adjacency matrix is uniform with all components equal to @xmath117 , and the probability of the scalar product in equation being positive simply reduces to the probability of the sum @xmath118 being positive .",
    "therefore , one can compute the probability of correct information aggregation of a regular network with easy central limit theorem considerations , analogous to those already presented in this section .",
    "such a probability does not depend on @xmath11 and reads : @xmath119 where the last approximation holds for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "as one can see , equation reduces to the above expression for @xmath120 ( though numerically one does not find perfect agreement between the two , since equations and represent good approximations only for very low values of @xmath111 ) .",
    "so , the lesson to be learned from the plots in fig . [ clt ] is twofold .",
    "first , one can see that as soon as a very small clique of uninformed hubs is introduced in a regular graph the overall population s ability to correctly aggregate information decreases sharply .",
    "this can be also understood by observing that the probability in equation does not recover the regular network ( rn ) result when considering vanishingly small fractions of hubs , i.e. : @xmath121 on the other hand , whenever a clique of hubs is present in the network , then information aggregation can actually be improved by increasing the size of the clique itself , up to the point ( for @xmath122 ) where the aggregation ability of the original regular graph can almost be reproduced .",
    "intuitively , the above findings can be altogether understood in the following terms . according to our setting ,",
    "all hubs in the clique @xmath8 are mutually connected and have a degree equal to @xmath123 .",
    "this means that each hub has exactly @xmath11 neighbors outside @xmath8 , so that one can expect roughly @xmath124 nodes to fall within the clique s neighborhood @xmath125 .",
    "so , for very low values of @xmath111 , @xmath125 contains a negligibly small number of nodes , which , however , will largely influence the initially uninformed hubs whenever they communicate for the first time .",
    "given the small size of @xmath125 , its initial state of knowledge will be much more sensitive to fluctuations in the initial signals distribution among agents . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath122 , the number of nodes in the neighborhood of @xmath8 becomes of order @xmath6 , hence much more robust with respect to fluctuations .    in summary ,",
    "the role of hubs in our model is subtle , as a handful of them is enough to heavily damage the good information aggregation properties of a population of equals ( as modeled by a regular graph ) , whereas increasing their number also has `` healing '' effects which can restore such good properties .",
    "so far , we only have considered the most popular and widely used evolution rule for the information propagation on a network , i.e. the parallel dynamics introduced in equation . however , as already discussed in section [ dyn_topology ] , parallel dynamics represents one of the two extreme cases of the general dynamics , according to which a fraction @xmath126 of agents listens to their neighbors at each time step @xmath0 , i.e. the case @xmath56 .",
    "the other extreme case is the already mentioned rns dynamics ( @xmath127 ) , according to which agents update their state of knowledge one at a time .",
    "numerical simulations highlight significant differences in a social network s ability to aggregate information correctly under parallel or rns dynamics , the latter performing much worse than the former : as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ transition ] , the probability of correct information aggregation under parallel dynamics outperforms the one obtained under rns dynamics over a wide range of signal informativeness levels a link is randomly selected and the two nodes that share it exchange information .",
    "however , none of the simulations we performed highlighted any significant difference between such a dynamics and the parallel one . ] .",
    "moreover , results obtained via rns dynamics show no relevant dependence on the system size @xmath6 .",
    "the above findings suggest to look for a transition in information aggregation as a function of the number of agents that update their state of knowledge at a given time step by letting the parameter @xmath126 take values over the whole interval @xmath128 $ ] . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ transition ] we plot the probability @xmath129 of correct information aggregation as a function of @xmath126 for different system sizes and a fixed informativeness level of the signals initially distributed to agents ( the qualitative overall appearance of the results is not changed when considering different levels of informativeness ) .    as can be seen , for increasing values of @xmath126",
    "a transition is observed towards better information aggregation capabilities for all system sizes .",
    "this can essentially be interpreted in terms of the speed of information update .",
    "as one could expect , rns dynamics is extremely slow compared to parallel dynamics ( depending on the system size , we find on average that rns dynamics reaches consensus in times that are 3 - 4 orders or magnitude larger than the ones required by parallel update ) , hence more prone to allow the spreading of misleading signals in the agents initial distribution . on the other hand , parallel dynamics is fast , in such a way that in a few time steps each agent receives through his / her neighbors aggregated information coming from the whole network .",
    "in summary , we have presented a stylized dynamic network model of the information diffusion throughout a large society featuring a small fraction of uninformed leaders .",
    "the model s simplicity allows , in some cases , to make analytical considerations .",
    "namely , when assuming all agents to simultaneously update their state of knowledge on a given issue , we are able to provide a closed - form expression for the probability of correct information aggregation as a function of the system size , i.e. the number of agents in the society , and the fraction of individuals playing the role of hubs . our results partially overlap with previous works from the social learning literature in economics , as we show that larger populations are better , on average , at aggregating information . on the other hand ,",
    "we provide interesting novel results on the role played by the size of an uninformed lite , portrayed in our model by a clique of nodes that do not own any prior information on the issue being discussed by the population .",
    "first , we show a rather counterintuitive result , i.e. that increasing the relative size ( compared to the overall population ) of such uninformed lites actually helps the information aggregation process .",
    "moreover , we show that letting the fraction of hubs go to zero does not recover the results obtained for the corresponding hub - free regular network .",
    "rather interestingly , we also show our model to be sensitive to the information update speed , as defined by the fraction of agents who simultaneously revise their information at each time step , by showing the existence of a transition towards better information aggregation capabilities when moving from the low speed towards the high speed regime .",
    "when assuming hubs to be identified by nodes @xmath130 , the network adjacency matrix @xmath69 takes the following block form : @xmath131 in the above equation , @xmath132 is an @xmath133 block such that @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 . the off - diagonal block @xmath137 is of size @xmath138 , and it accounts for neighbors of the clique @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath139 for @xmath81 and @xmath140 , or vice versa , and zero otherwise .",
    "lastly , the block @xmath141 is of size @xmath142 , and it accounts for links between nodes that do not belong to @xmath8 .",
    "spectral properties of the adjacency matrix @xmath69 , expressed in block form as in equation , can be deduced from standard perturbation theory . as a matter of fact ,",
    "such a matrix can be decomposed as @xmath143 , where @xmath144 for small values of @xmath11 ( i.e. the degree of nodes outside of @xmath8 ) , the matrix @xmath145 above is sparse and can be interpreted as a perturbation to the matrix @xmath146 describing the fully connected clique @xmath8 plus a sea of @xmath147 disconnected nodes .      *",
    "the largest eigenvalue reads @xmath150 , and its normalized eigenvector @xmath149 has the first @xmath9 components equal to @xmath151 and the remaining @xmath147 ones equal to zero . *",
    "@xmath152 for @xmath153 , with eigenvectors having non - zero components only in the first @xmath147 sites . * @xmath154 for @xmath155 , with eigenvectors that can simply be chosen as having all components equal to zero except for the @xmath22-th component being equal to one .",
    "let us then approximate the first eigenvector of the full adjacency matrix @xmath69 as @xmath156 and @xmath157 denote the first and second order corrections , respectively , to the unperturbed eigenvector @xmath158 .",
    "the first order correction only involves neighbors of the clique @xmath8 , and it reads @xmath159 where @xmath160 represents the number of neighbors that node @xmath22 has within the clique @xmath8 .",
    "the second order correction components of @xmath161 . however , such corrections are irrelevant to our analysis , so we can safely neglect them .",
    "] involves neighbors of the nearest neighbors of the clique @xmath8 : @xmath162 where @xmath163 denotes the set of next to nearest neighbors of the clique @xmath8 , whereas @xmath164 is the number of neighbors that node @xmath22 has amongst neighbors of the clique @xmath8 . in order to perform exact calculations up to second order",
    ", one should in principle compute the expected number of nodes belonging to @xmath125 and @xmath163 , and the expected values of the quantities @xmath165 in and @xmath166 in by averaging over all possible network configurations built as explained in section [ dyn_topology ] for given @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , in order to keep things simple , let us just assume that each node in @xmath125 has just one neighbor in the clique @xmath8 , and , in a similar fashion , that each node in @xmath163 has just one neighbor in @xmath125 , which amounts to posing @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , @xmath170 .",
    "clearly , both such approximations work well as long as the number of nodes in @xmath8 is small compared to @xmath6 , i.e. for @xmath103 where @xmath101 .      * @xmath171 components ( i.e. the number of nodes in @xmath125 ) equal to @xmath172 * @xmath173 components ( i.e. the number of nodes in @xmath163 ) equal to @xmath174 * @xmath175 components equal to zero .    therefore , the mean @xmath94 and standard deviation @xmath95 ( see equation ) can be computed as follows : @xmath176 and the approximations in equation can be immediately derived as leading order results in @xmath6 of the above expressions .",

    "<S> the ability of a society to make the right decisions on relevant matters relies on its capability to properly aggregate the noisy information spread across the individuals it is made of . in this paper we study the information aggregation performance of a stylized model of a society whose most influential individuals  the leaders  are highly connected among themselves and uninformed . </S>",
    "<S> agents update their state of knowledge in a bayesian manner by listening to their neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> we find analytical and numerical evidence of a transition , as a function of the noise level in the information initially available to agents , from a regime where information is correctly aggregated to one where the population reaches consensus on the wrong outcome with finite probability . </S>",
