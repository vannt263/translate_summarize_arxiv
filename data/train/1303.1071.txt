    "superfluid states in the nuclear environment have been extensively studied as they have a significative role in several physical processes , such as the structure of nuclei out the stability valley and the cooling dynamics of proto - neutron stars . + a variety of models and approximations",
    "have been used for this purpose @xcite , mainly non - relativistic potentials or effective forces , such as the density - dependent skyrme or gogny ones .",
    "it is not unusual a mixed treatment that combines both schemes in order to simplify involved calculations @xcite .",
    "+ approximately two decades ago a covariant model of the field theory of hadrons , generally known as quantum hadro - dynamics ( qhd ) @xcite , was used for the first time to study nuclear matter superfluidity @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons to use this theoretical framework to deal with nuclear superfluidity , in first place there are practical reasons , some self - consistent calculations are more simply stated and easily solved .",
    "this property gave rise to a version of qhd , known as density dependent hadron field theory @xcite which casts dirac - brueckner outputs in the qhd language .",
    "in second place one must consider field theory as a more adequate tool to make contact with the fundamental theory of strong interactions and the fact that covariant formulations are desirable for astrophysical applications , among others conceptual reasons .",
    "furthermore , the formalism has the versatility to include vacuum effects and finite renormalizations in a coherent way @xcite . +",
    "since qhd models are formulated as a many - body theory , one of its basic premises is the reproduction of the nuclear matter saturation properties .",
    "this can be fulfilled with a few adjustable parameters and even at the lowest order of approximation . once the free - parameters have been fixed , the qhd model has a noticeable prediction power .",
    "+ although a wide spreading of numerical results for the superfluid phase in infinite nuclear matter can be found in the literature , there is a qualitative agreement that the superfluid gap should not exceed 3 mev , and it should vanish for densities around the saturation density @xcite . unfortunately , the findings of @xcite for superfluid nuclear matter in the @xmath0 phase do not agree with these expectations .",
    "a maximum @xmath2 mev was found there , and only an unphysical reduction of 15% in the omega - meson mass yield results comparable with currently accepted values .",
    "+ this situation has not been changed substantially after the evaluation of different corrections into the original scheme .",
    "however , the good properties of this treatment have motivated mixed descriptions combining qhd models and conventional potentials @xcite . + more recently it was claimed that a coherent inclusion of meson proper self - energy @xcite , or adjustable quenching factor @xcite , could bring numerical calculations to the likely values .",
    "further studies about the effect of corrections of the meson propagators and the influence of low density instabilities on the superfluid gap can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "+ it was stressed in reference @xcite that the high momenta behavior of the repulsive potential has a crucial role in the exceedingly large values obtained for @xmath3 . it must be noticed that the relative strength of repulsive and attractive contributions have been calibrated for momenta below the fermi surface in order to produce the saturation mechanism",
    ". therefore it would be desirable a pairing potential which preserves the relative strength of its components in the fermi sphere , but having a repulsive component decreasing as faster as the attractive one in the high momenta domain .",
    "+ taking these facts into account we try in the present work , to obtain an effective and concise model able to deal with the superfluid phase of nuclear matter . for this purpose",
    "we use and compare several models of relativistic nuclear fields interacting through scalar and vector mesons . as a first approach",
    ", we reduce to its minimal expression the complexity of the nuclear interaction , but further refinements can be considered .",
    "we introduce a characteristic length scale in the effective interaction , which could eventually be traced back to the confining mechanism of the fundamental theory of strong interactions .",
    "a similar approach was applied in the past to describe heavy ion collisions @xcite as well as nuclear matter properties @xcite .",
    "it has been known as finite volume correction since it takes into account the spread of the nucleon localization .",
    "the relevance of this effect upon the evaluation of some bulk properties of the nuclear matter has been stressed long time ago @xcite .",
    "+ in the next section we present the theoretical deduction of the general gap equation at finite temperature in a context of landau - fermi liquid .",
    "the last part of this section is devoted to the theoretical deduction of the self - consistent expression defining the superfluid gap for the @xmath0 phase within the qhd framework .",
    "in section 3 we show the numerical results and discuss them .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the different superfluid phases in a fermionic system can be described in a general and compact way within the formalism of the fermi liquid , using for instance the formalism of reference @xcite .",
