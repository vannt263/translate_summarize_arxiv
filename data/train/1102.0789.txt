    "many physical systems yield wave - like solutions which satisfy the wave equation with a speed of propagation @xmath0 , @xmath1\\phi ( \\mathbf{x},t ) = 0\\ ] ] which is also the massless klein - gordon equation . to leading order",
    ", the lagrangian of any such field obeys a lorentz - like symmetry of lorentz transformations scaled with the limiting speed @xmath0 , even if the underlying system does not have that invariance .",
    "however , if there are multiple fields , they will in general have different limiting velocities , and there will not be a global lorentz symmetry . if the fundamental interactions are emergent phenomenon from an underlying theory without lorentz invariance@xcite , we might expect that particles would display different limiting speeds .    in this paper",
    "we show how interactions between the fields can lead to a universal limiting velocity , i.e. the speed of light , at low energies .",
    "we calculate how the different fields influence each other s propagation velocity through the self - energy diagrams , and then use the renormalization group to scale the results to low energy . using several examples",
    "we show that the condition of equal velocities is the low energy endpoint of renormalization group evolution .",
    "a heuristic explanation for this is that because fields can split into other types of fields , the propagation velocity of one field approaches that of the related other fields",
    ".    this result could be useful if the fields of the standard model are emergent from an underlying theory that is not lorentz invariant .",
    "of course , lorentz invariance is conventionally taken as one of the foundational principles underlying all our fundamental interactions . however , the weinberg - witten @xcite theorem is usually interpreted as telling us that non - abelian gauge bosons and gravitons can not be emergent fields arising from any underlying lorentz invariant non - gauge theory .",
    "all known examples@xcite satisfy this property . therefore if the idea of emergent fields has any application in the fundamental interactions it appears required that lorentz invariance is also emergent .",
    "our results show that a universal limiting velocity can be an emergent property in the low energy limit .",
    "however , in general the difference in velocity runs towards zero only logarithmically .",
    "this means that the underlying scale of emergence needs to be exponentially far away , making it difficult to test any feature of that theory which is power - suppressed .",
    "for example , we estimate that the scale where differences in the velocity are of order 10% would be beyond @xmath2  gev .",
    "because of this feature we propose a model that produces much faster power - law running .",
    "the model involves a large number of fields which accelerate the running .",
    "another consequence of the running speeds is that observable differences in the velocities would be greatest if the interactions are the weakest .",
    "this suggests that the measurement of the velocity of gravitational waves would be the most sensitive test of this aspect of emergence .",
    "this paper has the following structure . in the next section",
    "we give some general comments on our procedure .",
    "then in sec . 3 , 4 , 5 and 6",
    "we calculate the beta functions for yukawa theories , electrodynamics , yang - mills and mixed theories respectively .",
    "all cases yield beta functions such that the limiting velocities run towards each other at low energy . in sec 7",
    ", we analyze the general effects of logarithmic running and address the phenomenological constraints . because of the difficulties posed by logarithmic running",
    ", we display a model with power - law running in sec . 8 .",
    "we close with a summary and discussion .",
    "some of the more technical details are described in a pair of appendices .",
    "we assume that different species of fermions , scalars and gauge fields emerge at some uv scale with different speeds of light . in condensed matter systems , phonons and magnons",
    "do not propagate at the same speed .",
    "similarly , the same behavior is expected to carry on in an emergent theory of nature . in the absence of any form of interactions between particles ,",
    "their speeds are expected to be frozen as we run down to the ir .",
    "however , these particles are interacting due to yukawa and gauge forces .",
    "hence , the total lagrangian of such a system will be given by the sum of kinetic and interaction terms with certain _ bare _ coefficients specified initially at the uv .",
    "the parameter space of the system is spanned by the different speeds and interaction strengths . according to the principle of self - similarity and wilsonian renormalization",
    ", the same lagrangian will continue to describe the system at different energy scales provided that we replace the bare parameters with the _ renormalized _ ones .",
    "this can be achieved by integrating out the high momentum modes as we run down from uv to ir .",
    "quantum loops are sensitive to high momenta , and hence can be used to track the evolution of trajectories of the different speeds and interaction strengths in the parameter space .",
    "the evolution of these trajectories are encoded in the @xmath3 functions that are given by the gell - mann low equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass scale we introduce in dimensional regularization .    in theories with a universal limiting velocity , the lorentz symmetry prevents the renormalization of the speed of light , and one can set @xmath6 as a definition of natural units . however ,",
    "if different species carry different limiting velocities , @xmath0 , then these parameters also get renormalized and must be treated in the same manner as coupling constants .",
    "they carry a scale dependence through the renormalization procedure , and also generate their own beta function .",
    "we exploit this property to study the running of the limiting velocities .    throughout the paper we use dimensional regularization ( dim - reg ) .",
    "the high energy part of the quantum loops can be isolated by retaining only the @xmath7 pieces that arise upon using dim - reg .",
    "finally , we notice that our treatment is limited to one - loop corrections , and that the @xmath3 functions of the speeds require only self - energy corrections , while those of the couplings require vertex corrections as well ( see fig .",
    "[ quantum loops ] ) .",
    "we consider a two - species system , namely scalars and fermions , having different speeds of light at the uv and coupled through yukawa interaction .",

    "however , if the coupling is large ( and constant ) the running would be rapid with a power - law form , leading quickly to a universal speed of light",
    ".    however , the coupling itself also runs . for example , the yukawa coupling beta function can be integrated to yield @xmath189 with @xmath190 . while this coupling could be large at high energy it runs to smaller values at low energy",

    "this implies that the difference in the speeds runs only logarithmically towards each other .",
    "there are tight constraints on the equality of the limiting velocities for the different particles . for direct measurement of the velocities",
    ", we can look at timing accomplished at high energy accelerators .",
    "for example at lep , the electron beam travels at essentially the limiting velocity , since @xmath193 .",
    "the timing of the accelerator relies on this limiting velocity being the speed of light .",
    "because the timing of each bunch is recorded within @xmath194  ns over about 1000 revolutions in the 27  km accelerator@xcite , we estimate that this constrains @xmath195 for electrons .    however , indirect constraints are more powerful , and these have been described by altschul@xcite . for @xmath196",
    ", energetic electrons traveling faster than the speed of light will radiate cherenkov light , losing energy until they move at only the speed of light .",
    "this effect produces a maximum energy for subluminal motion , which is constrained by the observation of energetic electrons in astrophysics . for @xmath197",
    ", there is a constraint from the cutoff frequency in synchrotron emission .",
    "these constraints are more powerful than direct measurements because they bound factors of @xmath198 rather than the linear bounds on @xmath191 from the velocity measurements .",
    "altschul s bounds are @xmath199 .    in order to achieve this close equality of the different speeds with logarithmic running , the running needs to occur over an exponentially large energy range .",
    "for example , even if we take @xmath200 and @xmath201 ( which barely allows perturbation theory to be used near the energy @xmath183 ) , we would need @xmath202 , where we have generously used @xmath203 as the low energy scale .",
    "this clearly poses a problem for model building .",
    "in any realistic model of emergence without an intrinsic lorentz invariance , we do not expect the different species to emerge with the same limiting speed . in the above sections we showed that there is a potential mechanism to overcome this problem in a class of models whenever we run the renormalization group down to lower energies .",
    "however , we found that the speeds of light are forced to run logarithmically along with the running coupling constants .",
    "this is a relatively slow running if we want to meet the stringent constraints on lorentz violations without having to fine tune the speeds at the uv . in this section",
    ", we propose a way out of this situation .    in order to increase the effect of rg",
    "running there are two options .",
    "one is to keep the coupling constant large and unchanged with energy scale .",
    "such a nearly conformal theory would convert logarithmic running into power - law running , as we saw in the last section .",
    "we also need the large coupling such that the exponent is large .",
    "such theories are under active investigation @xcite in the context of `` walking technicolor '' where slowly running but strongly interacting theories are used to provide dynamical breaking of the electroweak theory while not producing excessive flavor changing processes .",
    "should walking technicolor theories prove successful , it would be quite interesting to tie those results with the idea of an emergent limiting velocity .",
    "the other option is if there are a very large number of fields of different scales , such that the running is increased by a large ( and energy dependent ) factor .",
    "we explore this option below .",
    "we introduce a large number @xmath204 of hidden fermions in addition to the standard model ( sm ) ones @xcite .",
    "moreover , we assume that all these fermions ( hidden and sm ) have the same origin , and hence all have the same initial speed of light @xmath205 , with @xmath206 , at some uv emergence scale @xmath183 . as a warm up calculation",
    ", we assume that the fermions have a common initial charge @xmath207 under a single @xmath124 gauge sector .",
    "the gauge photon emerges with some initial speed @xmath208 , with @xmath209 , that is different from the speed of fermions . at the uv scale",

    "instead , we numerically integrate our system setting appropriate values of the parameters @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 . from fig .",
    "[ rg flow of speeds and coupling ] we see that introducing many copies of @xmath124s achieves power - law suppression of @xmath191 in a very short interval .",
    "since the many @xmath124s do not intrude the evolution of @xmath218 , we can still get reasonable coupling strength in the ir .    to understand the choice of parameters used in the simulation in fig .",
    "[ rg flow of speeds and coupling ] , it is instructive to calculate the total number of fermions and gauge fields as seen in the uv . using eqs .",
    "[ power law running formulas ] and [ power law running for gauge bosons ] , and the numerical coefficients given in fig .",
    "[ rg flow of speeds and coupling ] ( take @xmath236 ) we find @xmath237 , and @xmath238 , which explains the above findings . because the rg flow of @xmath218 is enhanced only by a few number of fermionic species , the coupling constant runs only logarithmically . while the huge number of gauge fields that participate in the rg equation of speeds force the running of @xmath239 to be extremely fast .",
    "because the freezing of the speeds sets in almost immediately , we can try to replace the power law numbers in eqs .",
    "[ power law running formulas ] and [ power law running for gauge bosons ] by constant numbers .",
    "the idea is that we just need to have @xmath240 for a short interval until the speeds freeze to their desired values .",
    "then , we can immediately integrate the rg equations to find @xmath241 now if we take @xmath242 , @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 we find that @xmath246 , and @xmath247 .",
    "moreover , assuming that the masses of the hidden sectors are larger than @xmath248 , these masses decouple below @xmath248 and drop from the rg equations .",
    "therefore , one needs only a constant large number of copies , @xmath249 to accomplish the emergence of an ir lorentz - invariant fixed point in a short interval of running . moreover choosing the ratio @xmath250",
    ", we can meet the stringent constraints on the parameter @xmath191 .",
    "this opens up the possibility that many copies of hidden sectors may suppress lorentz - violating effects already present at the tev scale .",
    "achieving a universal speed of light is a challenge for theories which do not postulate an fundamental lorentz symmetry .",
    "this problem is visible in known emergence models@xcite and also in hoava - lifshitz gravity@xcite . for emergent gauge fields",
    ", the weinberg - witten theorem@xcite suggests that this will be a continual challenge as a lorentz - noninvariant initial theory may be required .",
    "we have shown through several examples that a common limiting velocity can be emergent at low energies even if the original high - energy theory involves fields satisfying the wave equation with different velocities .",
    "there is a heuristic rationale for this in that since fields can transform into each other through interactions , the endpoint where all the fields travel in unison is preferred .",
    "the renormalization group treatment indeed produces this outcome .",
    "because the running is only logarithmic for simple systems , it would take an exponentially large amount of running in order that the limiting velocities be close enough to agree with experiment .",
    "we addressed the phenomenological constraints in sec .",
    "7 . however , power law running is also possible if the coupling is large and constant , or if there are a very large number of interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "we have reported on a model with this latter property .",
    "it is important to note that not all forms of lorentz - violation disappear at low energies .",
    "the renormalization of a general parameterization of lorentz - violation of qed has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and some operators that grow at low energy are found . a well behaved emergent theory must avoid those operators .",
    "the running of the limiting velocities only happens due to the interactions that couple one type of particle to another .",
    "this implies that the running will be weakest if the coupling is weak . at low energies the gravitational coupling is by far the weakest of all the fundamental forces",
    "this implies that the most plausible velocity difference would be that of gravity .",
    "while there have been some claims that the speed of gravity has been indirectly measured@xcite , the consensus appears to be that there is no experimental constraint on the speed of gravity@xcite .",
    "however indirectly there is a stringent limit at the @xmath251 level on the difference of the speeds of gravity and that of light from gravitational cherenkov radiation @xcite which is valid if the speed of gravity is less than that of light .",
    "future experiment with gravitational wave detectors provide the best opportunity to measure or constrain the difference if the speed of gravity is greater than that of light .",
