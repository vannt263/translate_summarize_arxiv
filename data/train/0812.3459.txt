    "during the last decade a great deal of research has focussed on electrical conduction through individual molecules@xcite .",
    "many molecules are electrically polarized due to chemical charge transfer between unlike atoms .",
    "this results in electric fields that should influence electrical conduction through such molecules and through molecules in their vicinity .",
    "however , there have been few direct experimental investigations of such effects in the context of molecular - scale nanoelectronics .",
    "recently experimental studies of the effects of charged chemical species attached to a molecule on electrical conduction through the _ same _ molecule have been reported @xcite .",
    "the presence of a charged dangling bond on a silicon surface has been observed to affect electrical conduction through nearby molecules@xcite and , conversely , transport through adjacent silicon atoms has been found to be perturbed by dipole fields due to molecules located elsewhere in the si 7@xmath17 cell@xcite .",
    "however , no experimental work directly probing the effects of electric fields emanating from polar molecules on electrical conduction through _ other _ individual molecules has been reported to date .",
    "this topic is explored experimentally and theoretically in the present article.@xcite the influence of these electric fields on electrical conduction through the underlying semiconductor substrate to which the molecules are bound is also examined.@xcite    the specific systems that we study here are one - dimensional ( 1d ) organic heterostructures consisting of chains of substituted styrene molecules grown on hydrogen - terminated si substrates by the self - directed growth mechanism described by lopinski and coworkers@xcite originally for styrene on h : si(100 ) 2@xmath11 but subsequently applied to a wide range of molecules .",
    "the substituents in the present work are cf@xmath0 and och@xmath0 groups , one of which replaces a single hydrogen atom bound to the aromatic carbon ring of each styrene molecule . in each case",
    "the substituent is in the  para \" position .",
    "each heterostructure consists of a line of surface bound och@xmath0styrene molecules joined end - to - end ( at the heterojunction ) to a line of cf@xmath0styrene molecules .",
    "the och@xmath0 group donates electrons to the aromatic ring of the styrene and is therefore positively charged while the cf@xmath0 group withdraws electrons and is negatively charged .",
    "however , electric polarization also occurs _ within _",
    "the cf@xmath0 and och@xmath0 groups themselves and we find the resulting molecular multipole fields to also play an important role in electrical conduction in these systems .    in the experimental work presented here electrical conduction between the silicon substrate and a tungsten scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) tip via the molecular heterostructures",
    "was measured at room temperature in ultra - high vacuum under a variety of bias conditions .",
    "strongly enhanced conduction was observed through a group of several och@xmath0styrene molecules near the heterojunction at low and moderate negative substrate bias . under positive substrate bias similar pronounced enhancement of the molecular conduction near cf@xmath0styrene / och@xmath0styrene heterojunctions",
    "was absent .",
    "in related heterostructures , cf@xmath0styrene lines in a _ side - by - side _ configuration were found to locally depress transport originating from filled states in the underlying silicon . as will be explained below these qualitative differences",
    "can be understood as arising from the different structural , electronic and electrostatic properties of och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules on silicon .",
    "the och@xmath0styrene / cf@xmath0styrene heterowires were modeled theoretically by determining their ground state electrostatic potential profiles ( at zero applied bias ) by means of _ ab initio _ density functional theory - based computations , and then employing semi - empirical tight binding models together with the _ ab initio _",
    "electrostatic profiles , solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation and landauer theory to calculate the electric current between the tungsten stm tip and the silicon substrate under bias via the molecular heterostructure .",
    "we note that while the use of density functional theory for performing _ transport _ calculations in molecular wires lacks a fundamental justification and is increasingly being questioned in the literature,@xcite the use of density functional theory to calculate ground state electrostatic potentials is justified ( at least in principle ) by a lemma proved originally by hohenberg and kohn .",
    "@xcite the usefulness of such density functional theory - based _ electrostatic potential _",
    "calculations for the present system is supported also by the fact that the present theory is able to explain the experimentally observed phenomena outlined in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the theoretical work that is presented here demonstrates that electric fields due to intramolecular charge transfer within och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules can ( for appropriate molecular geometries ) result in enhanced electrical conduction through certain molecules in chains of och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules on silicon , consistent with the experimental stm data : these electric fields shift the energies of the molecular homo and lumo states of _ like _ molecules in different parts of the chain by _ differing _ amounts with the result that resonant conduction begins at lower bias voltages on some molecules in the chain than on others .",
    "the differences in the observed behavior under positive and negative applied bias and between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules are accounted for in terms of this electrostatically modulated resonant transport mechanism .",
    "the present theory predicts that conduction through individual molecules in such systems can be changed by orders of magnitude by varying the conformations of ( and hence the arrangement of charges in ) molecules in their vicinity .",
    "this raises the possibility of molecular switches of a new type that depend for their operation not on conformational changes in the molecular wire carrying the current ( as has been discussed previously@xcite ) but on conformational changes in _ other _ nearby molecules that result in changes in the energy level structure of the molecular wire .",
    "an advantage of a conformational switch based on this different principle is that the molecular wire that carries the current need not be a moving part in the device .",
    "the shorter range of electrostatic fields due to molecular dipoles ( and higher multipoles ) than those of electric monopoles such as the charged dangling bond studied in ref .",
    "is also advantageous , making it possible in principle to achieve higher densities of molecular switches controlled by molecular dipoles in potential device applications . the greater chemical stability of a polar molecule than a charged radical is also an important advantage .",
    "furthermore manipulating the orientations of molecular dipoles may be an attractive alternative@xcite to inducing switching by charging and discharging atomic or molecular - scale constituents of the ultimate nanoscale electronic devices .",

    "postponing discussion of the interfacial height enhancement for the time being , the bias dependent height response of the och@xmath0styrene line segment near the terminal dangling bond is much like that reported in ref . for a single homomolecular styrene line segment : at elevated negative substrate bias , ( @xmath17 v ) the highest band of occupied @xmath11 states in the och@xmath0styrene lies above the tip fermi - level and the och@xmath0styrene images with roughly uniform height . as the bias decreases in magnitude , these occupied @xmath11 states of the och@xmath0styrene approach the tip fermi - level ( and eventually begin to drop below it ) , and the molecules image with reduced height above the surface .",
    "molecules in the vicinity of the negatively charged dangling bond on the degenerately doped n - type surface exhibit a spatially dependent reduction in ionisation potential due to the electrostatic field emanating from the negatively charged dangling bond.@xcite thus at low bias , molecules nearest the terminal dangling bond image with increasing height.@xcite    in stark departure from the imaging characteristics of homomolecular styrene chains reported in ref . , and absent from the images of the ch@xmath0styrene / styrene heterowires studied in ref .",

    "these heterowires were identified on a region of the crystal where imaging of the h : silicon surface before line growth was not carried out .",
    "the chemical identities of the line segments were confirmed at the end of the imaging sequence by dosing with cf@xmath0styrene , and comparing the imaging characteristics of the newly reacted line segments ( not shown ) with the nearby heterowires .",
    "characteristics in these images ( in combination with those in fig.[fig_1expt ] ) are representative of the range of tip - dependent imaging contrast encountered over the course of the experiments .",

    "this contrast reversal ( tip dependent ) is often encountered at low bias in filled - state imaging . in all instances , whether or not this low bias contrast reversal occurs , height enhancement of the interfacial och@xmath0styrene remains prominent and corresponds to the height of och@xmath0styrene far from the interface at greater magnitude filled - state bias ( i.e. the interfacial och@xmath0styrene images as though accompanied by a localised increase in effective tip - sample bias magnitude ) .",
    "figs [ fig_2expt](c ) to ( f ) show empty - state images for the 3 heterowire cluster . in fig.[fig_2expt](c ) at @xmath23v , the cf@xmath0styrene images above ( brighter than ) the och@xmath0styrene .",
    "as is discussed in section [ positive ] this result is consistent with the increased electron affinity of the cf@xmath0styrene ( a result of the highly electronegative f atoms ) .",
    "as the @xmath11 * state for the cf@xmath0styrene is much lower than the corresponding @xmath11 * states belonging to the och@xmath0styrene , a greater number of tip states can tunnel into the cf@xmath0styrene ( and therefore , the stm tip must travel further away from the surface above the cf@xmath0styrene to maintain a constant tunnel current across the heterostructure ) . in fig.[fig_2expt](d ) , @xmath24v and the tip fermi - level is presumed to lie below both the och@xmath0styrene ( as before ) and cf@xmath0styrene @xmath11 * states .",
    "the tunnel current is dominated by carrier injection into the silicon conduction band , and the molecules image ( non - resonantly ) with similar contrast .    figs [ fig_2expt](e ) and ( f ) display empty - state imaging data acquired at @xmath14 = + 2.0 v following spontaneous tip structural changes . in this imaging mode , the och@xmath0styrene images above ( brighter than ) the cf@xmath0styrene .",
    "this imaging behaviour when apparent , often extends to greater bias ( up to @xmath14 = + 3.2 v ) .",
    "in addition to this empty - state contrast reversal , changes to the molecular corrugation within the homomolecular line segments are apparent ( particularly in terms of the appearance of the och@xmath0styrene between frames ( d ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "it is clear in these experiments that the tip density of states plays a considerable role in determining the contrast ( in terms of overall height and/or molecular corrugation ) observed between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene line segments .",
    "tip - dependent imaging contrast in stm of organic molecules has been documented previously.@xcite    while the empty - state imaging displays considerable contrast variation , of particular significance is the absence of notable interfacial structure .",
    "an exception to this was observed in a small portion of low bias empty - state images which revealed height enhancement for a single interfacial molecule .",
    "the height enhancement was between 0.01 to 0.02 nm , and smaller than the 0.02 nm to 0.14 nm height enhancement observed for the considerably broader ( @xmath25 molecule wide ) filled - state interfacial features resolved in figs [ fig_1expt](c)-(d ) , [ fig_2expt](b ) , and others ( not shown ) . while such a narrow empty - state feature appears in the simulation work presented in sections [ case ] and [ relationship ] , additional observations will be required before a detailed comparison with theory can be undertaken .",

    "the prominence ( both in terms of height and lateral extent ) of the filled - state interfacial feature compared with the absence of significant interfacial structure resolved in empty - state imaging in these structures , suggests an electronic origin for the effect . as the low bias imaging conditions required to observe the filled - state interfacial feature also result in decreased tip - sample separation , the possibility of tip - molecule interactions at the heterojunction leading to altered molecular conformations which contribute to the observed interfacial structure can not be ruled out .",

    "the errors in these energy offsets obtained from the density functional calculations have recently been estimated for a few molecules to range from 0.6 to 1.4ev.@xcite because of these and other@xcite deficiencies , the predictions of transport calculations based on _ ab initio _ density functional calculations of the electronic structure are unreliable for molecules on silicon ; they are able to capture some observable phenomena@xcite but are qualitatively incorrect for others.@xcite    in the case of linear chains of styrene@xcite and methyl - styrene@xcite molecules grown by self - assembly on a hydrogenated ( 001 ) silicon surface , the incorrect offsets between the molecular homo levels and the silicon valence band edge given by the density functional calculations result in such calculations yielding qualitatively incorrect stm images for these systems.@xcite in particular , at low bias the _ ab initio _ calculations predict _ minima _ in the stm height profiles of the molecular chains over the centers of the molecules where _ maxima _ are observed experimentally.@xcite these deficiencies of the _ ab initio _ calculations have been overcome@xcite by developing a different electronic structure model based on extended hckel theory , a tight binding scheme from quantum chemistry @xcite that provides an approximate description of the electronic structures of many molecules and has also been used successfully to explain the experimental current - voltage characteristics of a variety molecular wires connecting metal electrodes@xcite and to model the band structures of a variety of crystalline solids @xcite    extended hckel theory describes molecular systems in terms of a small set of slater - type atomic orbitals @xmath31 and a hamiltonian matrix @xmath32 . the diagonal hamiltonian elements @xmath33 are taken to be the atomic orbital ionization energies and the non - diagonal elements @xmath34 for @xmath35 are expressed in terms of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and phenomenological parameters chosen for consistency with experimental molecular electronic structure data . as is described in detail in ref . , the standard extended hckel theory@xcite was modified so as to also provide an accurate description of the band structures of the silicon substrate and the tungsten stm tip .",

    "the model proved to be remarkably successful , accounting not only for this low bias property of the stm images , but also for several counter - intuitive features of the experimental data , including the experimentally observed reversal in the contrast between the styrene and methyl - styrene molecular chains with increasing stm tip bias , the observed increase in the apparent height of the molecules at the ends of the molecular chains relative to those far from the ends with increasing bias and the observed disappearance of the corrugation of the stm height profile along the molecular chains with increasing bias.@xcite    the tight binding model based on extended hckel theory that is described in ref .",
    "is adopted in the present work but with an important modification : a limitation of extended hckel theory is that in it the atomic orbital energy @xmath36 depends on the type of atom on which orbital @xmath39 is located but is not influenced by the presence of other atoms in the vicinity .",
    "this is a reasonable first approximation for the styrene and methylstyrene molecules considered in ref . since those molecules do not contain strongly charged groups .",
    "however for the och@xmath40-styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules that will be considered here , there is strong charge transfer between carbon atoms and fluorine and oxygen atoms that results in significant electrostatic fields that should modify the atomic orbital energies @xmath36 of surrounding atoms .",

    ", the use of density functional theory at the level of lda or gga for calculating electronic quasiparticle properties has no fundamental justification , this criticism does not apply to calculations of the ground state electronic charge density distribution _ and the electrostatic potentials _ that that have been shown by hohenberg and kohn@xcite to be functionals of the charge density .",
    "therefore the use of _ ab initio _ density functional calculations to estimate the electrostatic contributions to the atomic orbital energies @xmath36 that are due to charge transfer between different atoms ( but are neglected in extended hckel theory ) , while still involving approximations , is justified at the fundamental level . in the present work these electrostatic corrections to extended hckel theory",
    "were included in our model in the following way :    an _ ab initio _ calculation was carried out@xcite of the electrostatic potential @xmath41 at the nucleus of every atom @xmath42 of an atomic cluster that included a molecular chain with a total of 20 och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules in the geometry that they take on the silicon surface , a few layers of nearby si atoms , and the h atoms needed to passivate the dangling bonds on the surface of this silicon cluster .",
    "a similar _ ab initio _ calculation was carried out@xcite of the electrostatic potential @xmath43 at the nucleus of each of these atoms in the _ absence _ of all of the other atoms .",
    "thus @xmath44 is an estimate of the contribution to the electrostatic energy of an electron in an atomic orbital on atom @xmath42 that is due to the presence of all of the _ other _ other atoms in the system , calculated self - consistently from first principles .",
    "i.e. , it is the electrostatic contribution to the atomic orbital energy that is neglected in extended hckel theory , as discussed above .",
    "this contribution was included in the present model by making the substitution @xmath45 ( for each atomic orbital @xmath39 of every atom @xmath42 ) in the diagonal elements @xmath46 of the extended hckel - like model hamiltonian obtained for this system as described in ref .. because the orbital basis used is not orthogonal ( as in standard extended hckel theory ) , the non - diagonal matrix elements of the model hamiltonian were also adjusted according to @xmath47 for orbitals @xmath39 and @xmath48 on atoms @xmath42 and @xmath49 as required for gauge invariance.@xcite the effect of the bias voltage applied experimentally between the stm tip and the silicon substrate on the hamiltonian matrix @xmath50 was included in the present model as in ref ..    since in the above theoretical approach a highly compute - intensive _ ab initio _ calculation of the effects of charge transfer is carried out only once for any molecular chain being studied and a smaller basis set is used in the transport calculations that follow , in addition to correcting some fundamental deficiencies of density functional theory as discussed above , the present approach is able to treat much larger systems than is practical to study by _ ab initio _ methods alone .",
    "this was crucial for the present work where fairly long molecular chains on si needed to be studied and the system is not periodic along the molecular chain .",
    "the electric current flowing between the stm tip and silicon substrate via the adsorbed molecules was evaluated as described in detail in ref . by solving the lippmann - schwinger equation , determining from the solution the landauer transmission probability @xmath51 that depends on the electron energy @xmath52 and applied bias voltage @xmath53 and",

    "therefore a molecular mechanics method was adopted : chains of 40 molecules , half of the chain och@xmath0styrene and the other half cf@xmath0styrene , on a hydrogenated silicon cluster were relaxed using the universal force field model@xcite starting from a variety of initial configurations , and many different metastable relaxed structures were found .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that many of them as well as intermediate structures between them were being sampled thermally in the experiment which was carried out at room temperature .",
    "thus the limited accuracy of the structures given by the molecular mechanics method was deemed to be adequate for the purpose of the present study .",
    "since the phenomena of interest in the present work were observed experimentally near the junction of the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene chains , the relaxed molecular chain was truncated to a subset of 20 molecules surrounding the junction and the calculations of the electrostatic potential and of electrical conduction between the silicon substrate and stm tip via the molecules were carried out for this truncated chain of molecules and underlying h - terminated si cluster with a dimerized ( 001 ) surface without further relaxation .",
    "the stm tip in the present work was modelled as in ref . as a 15 tungsten atom cluster with a ( 001 ) orientation and a single terminating atom , and coupled to an electron reservoir by many ideal leads .      in the present theoretical approach ,",
    "the energy offsets between the homo levels of the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene parts of the molecular chain are given by the extended hckel theory with the parameterization described in ref .",
    ", modified so as to yield an accurate band structure for silicon and to include the _ ab initio _ electrostatic corrections",
    "@xmath62 as discussed in section [ formalism ] . the same applies to the molecular lumo levels and to the variation of the atomic orbital energies from molecule to molecule along the molecular chain .",
    "the molecular homo and lumo levels for both types of molecules considered here reside primarily on the benzene rings of the molecules .",
    "thus , because of the electron withdrawing ( donating ) nature of the cf@xmath0 ( och@xmath0 ) group , the och@xmath0styrene homo is higher in energy than the cf@xmath0styrene homo,@xcite and the cf@xmath0styrene lumo is lower than the och@xmath0styrene lumo .",
    "thus the homo of the molecular chain as a whole is located on its och@xmath0styrene part ( as has already been mentioned in section [ expt ] ) and the lumo of the molecular chain as a whole is located on its cf@xmath0styrene part .",
    "however , as in ref . , the energy offset between the molecular homo of the molecular chain and the silicon valence band edge is an adjustable parameter of the present theory whose value is not known accurately : as was discussed at the beginning of section [ formalism ] , this offset is not given correctly by calculations based on standard density functional theories ; its accurate determination ( like the determination of the energy offsets between the molecular levels and substrate fermi levels for other molecular nanowires@xcite ) is a difficult unsolved problem of molecular electronics .",
    "however , based on the discussion of our experimental results that follows it is plausible that the molecular homo is located below the silicon valence band edge and the molecular lumo is located above the silicon conduction band edge :    an important aspect of the experimental data presented in section [ expt ] is that even for the smallest values of @xmath18 , the bias voltage voltage between the stm tip and substrate at which imaging of the molecular chains was feasible , @xmath63 was considerably larger than the band gap of silicon , for _ both _ positive and negative biasing of the silicon substrate relative to the stm tip . given that the fermi level of the stm tip at zero bias is located within the si band gap , it therefore follows that the stm tip fermi level was well below the top of the silicon valence band or well above the bottom of the silicon conduction band when the molecules were being imaged for negative and positive biasing of the substrate relative to the stm tip , respectively .",
    "a reasonable interpretation of this fact ( that is consistent with all of the experimental data and with the results of our theoretical modeling ) is that the homo of the molecular chain is located in energy below the silicon valence band edge , that the lumo of the molecular chain is above the silicon conduction band edge , and that the experimental imaging of the molecular chains themselves ( in the present study ) was being carried out for stm tip fermi energies near or above the lumo or near or below the homo of the molecular chain , conditions under which enhancement of stm currents due to resonant or near resonant transport via the molecules is to be expected .",
    "this will be the view adopted in the remainder of this article .",
    "thus three regimes will be considered theoretically for both positive and negative substrate bias :    \\1 .",
    "very low bias at which the stm tip fermi level lies between the si conduction band minimum ( valence band maximum ) and the molecular lumo ( homo ) energy levels .",
    ". low bias at which the stm tip fermi level is slightly above ( below ) the lowest ( highest ) molecular lumo ( homo ) level .",
    "higher bias at which the stm tip fermi level is near the top ( bottom ) of the lowest ( highest ) molecular lumo ( homo ) band .    as will be seen below",
    ", each regime is predicted to have its own characteristic signature in stm imaging that can be compared with our experimental data .",
    "these signatures do not depend qualitatively on the precise value assumed for the offset between the silicon valence band edge and molecular homo level .",
    "thus comparison between theory and experiment allows us to draw conclusions regarding the specific regimes in which the data was being taken and the physical mechanisms underlying the phenomena that were observed .",
    "different conformations have been proposed for styrene molecules on h terminated si(100)@xcite and it is reasonable to suppose that different atomic geometries are possible for the substituted styrenes on si that are studied here .",
    "one possibility is that the c atom of the molecule that bonds to the c atom that bonds to the si is located over the  trench \" between two si dimer rows as is shown in fig.[fig_4struct](a ) for och@xmath0styrene and in fig.[fig_4struct](b ) for cf@xmath0styrene .",
    "this conformation is similar to that assumed for chains of styrene molecules on si in refs and and will be referred to as  the t - tethered geometry \" . in another conformation",

    "however , the opposite ( d ) orientation of the och @xmath0 group with the c oriented towards the si dimer to which the molecule bonds as shown in fig.[fig_4struct](d ) is also possible .",
    "the molecular conformations described above are ideal cases : molecule - molecule interactions in the molecular chains and thermal motion at room temperature are expected to result in many intermediate geometries with the molecular benzene ring and the co bond of the och@xmath0 group not being coplanar with each other or with the silicon dimer to which the molecule bonds and the och@xmath0 and cf@xmath0 groups being rotated through different angles about the bonds that link them to their respective molecules . as will be seen below , these deviations from the ideal geometries need to be taken into consideration when modeling the experimental stm images of the molecular heterowires",
    ". however it will often be convenient in the discussions that follow to classify molecular structures according to the idealized structures such as those in fig.[fig_4struct ] ( t or d tethered molecule , t or d oriented och@xmath0 group ) that they most closely resemble .",
    "in this section we present theoretical results for electrical conduction between the stm tip and si substrate through a particular 20-molecule cf@xmath0styrene / och@xmath0styrene chain on the dimerized h - terminated ( 001 ) silicon surface .",

    "some further details of this structure should also be noted since they shall prove to be crucial in making the connection between the theoretical results that will follow and key aspects of our experimental data : _ most _ of the molecules lean somewhat in the direction away from the heterojunction and also have swung outwards somewhat ( away from the heterojunction ) about the axes of the tethering si - c bonds , as one might expect for molecules subject to a net weak mutual steric repulsion . due to the repulsion between the f atoms on different cf@xmath0styrene molecules ,",
    "the cf@xmath0 groups are all rotated through different angles about the bonds between the cf@xmath0 groups and the molecules benzene rings , and the benzene rings themselves are tilted somewhat differently from molecule to molecule . because of this the detailed structure of cf@xmath0styrene chain is more complex and less well ordered than that of the och@xmath0styrene chain .",

    "in both figures , curves l ( black ) are calculated current profiles along the molecular chain in the very low bias regime 1 introduced in section [ level ordering ] : here the stm tip fermi level lies between the silicon conduction band edge and the lowest state of the molecular lumo band in fig .",

    "the relevant information is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] ( a ) .",
    "there the red curve ( ph ) shows the average of @xmath62 over the six carbon atoms of the benzene ring of each molecule ( the scale is on the left axis ) vs. the lateral position of the center of the ring along the molecular chain .",
    "since the homo and lumo of both the cf@xmath0styrene and och@xmath0styrene are located principally on the benzene ring , the red curve is an approximate guide as to how the molecular homo and lumo orbital energies are affected by the electrostatic potentials due to charge transfer between the atoms of this system .",
    "the blue dotted vertical line separates the och@xmath0styrene part of the chain on the right from the cf@xmath0styrene part on the left .",
    "the black curve labeled si ( for which the scale is on the right axis ) shows @xmath62 for the si atoms to which the molecules bond .",
    "these electrostatic shifts differ by several tenths of an ev between the och@xmath0styrene and the cf@xmath0styrene parts of the molecular chain due to the different signs and magnitudes of the charge transfer between the cf@xmath0 and och@xmath0 substituent groups and the benzene rings of the respective molecules .",
    "they result in a further lowering of the homo and lumo of the cf@xmath0styrene relative to those of the och@xmath0styrene in addition to that predicted by extended hckel theory and also a _ very local _ band bending of the silicon conduction and valence bands in the immediate vicinity of the molecular chain ; the si band edges are lower in energy near the cf@xmath0styrene chain than near the the och@xmath0styrene .",
    "the horizontal dotted line in fig . [ fig_7pots ] ( a ) indicates @xmath62 for surface si atoms if all molecules are replaced by h atoms bound to the si ; the effect of such ( passivating ) h atoms on the orbital energies of the surface si atoms is intermediate between those of och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene molecules bound to the silicon .",
    "because of the form of these electrostatic profiles , when the si substrate is biased positively relative to the stm tip , the fermi level of the metal tip crosses the si conduction band edge near the cf@xmath0styrene chain and the lumo levels of the cf@xmath0styrene before doing so at the och@xmath0styrene . thus the cf@xmath0styrene appears higher than the och@xmath0styrene for positive substrate bias .",
    "this is seen in the theoretical current plots in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] and also experimentally in fig .",
    "[ fig_2expt](c ) although , as was discussed in section [ expt ] the contrast between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene depends on the unknown microscopic details of the stm tip .",
    "as will be discussed in section [ relationship ] it also depends on the specific conformation of the molecular chain .    the red curve ( ph ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] ( a ) has a sharp minimum at the third cf@xmath0styrene molecule from the junction with the och@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "thus the molecular lumo level is lowest at that molecule .",

    "[ fig_5th ] ( which is at lower bias ) because in that case the stm tip fermi level is still too far away from the molecular lumo levels for resonant tunneling through those levels to be important ; thus the larger electrostatic shift of the third cf@xmath0styrene molecule s lumo level does not play a large role here . when the bias is large enough for the stm tip s fermi level to have risen to the top of the molecular cf@xmath0- styrene lumo band _ all _ of the molecular lumo orbitals throughout the cf@xmath0styrene chain",
    "are transmitting resonantly so that the difference between the third cf@xmath0styrene molecule and the other cf@xmath0styrene molecules has been largely erased in the blue curve h in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] .",
    "notice that although the si band edge is lowered locally around the cf@xmath0styrene molecules ( see the black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] ( a ) ) so that one may expect the si to appear higher in that vicinity than elsewhere in empty state stm images , the black curve labelled si in fig . [ fig_7pots ] ( a ) does _ not _ show a minimum at the third cf@xmath0styrene molecule from the junction , confirming that it is the local electrostatic lowering of the molecular lumo at that molecule and not the effect of the electric fields at the si that is responsible for the prominent feature at the third cf@xmath0styrene molecule in the red profile e in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] .    at the bias voltages considered in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] the tip fermi level is well below the och@xmath0styrene lumo states so that resonant transport via the och@xmath0styrene lumo states is not important and thus there is little contrast between different parts of the och@xmath0- styrene chain except possibly at the highest bias value shown for the och@xmath0styrene molecule that is closest to the cf@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "notice also that in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] the contrast between the cf@xmath0styrene and och@xmath0styrene chains decreases markedly with _ decreasing _ magnitude of the applied bias .",
    "this is because the role of resonant transmission via the molecular levels in the cf@xmath0styrene part of the chain is decreasing rapidly whereas no resonant transmission is involved in conduction via the och@xmath0styrene which is therefore less sensitive to the magnitude of the applied bias .",
    "this behavior is in qualitative agreement with the experimental data in fig . [",
    "fig_2expt](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the qualitative features of the theoretical current profiles for negative substrate bias in fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] can also be understood by considering the electrostatic energy profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] ( a ) :    the current profile at very low bias ( black curve l , fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] ) shows only weak contrast between different parts of the cf@xmath0styrene chain and between different parts of the och@xmath0styrene chain because the tip fermi level is between the silicon valence band edge and the molecular homo levels so that resonant tunneling via the molecular homo levels ( that is strongly modulated by local extrema of the electrostatic potential along the chain of molecular benzene rings exhibited by the red curve in fig . [ fig_7pots ] ( a ) ) is not occurring.@xcite    when the tip fermi level falls below the highest molecular homo - derived level ( which is located at and around the second och@xmath0styrene molecule from the junction where the electronic electrostatic potential energy [ the red curve b in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] ( a ) ] has its maximum ) the current develops a strong maximum there because of the onset of resonant conduction via the molecular homo in that vicinity .",
    "this is why the red curve e of fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] has a strong maximum at the second och@xmath0styrene molecule from the junction .",
    "with further increase of the bias voltage the tip fermi level moves deeper into the molecular homo band and resonant transport via molecular states derived from the molecular homo becomes possible in other parts of the och@xmath0styrene chain as well and thus the peak in the current profile of the och@xmath0styrene chain becomes less pronounced , as in the blue curve h in fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] .",
    "notice also that with increasing bias the boundary between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene chains becomes blurred with the higher current typical of the och@xmath0styrene chain extending to the nearest one or two cf@xmath0styrene molecules , as in the feature labelled * in the blue curve h in fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] .",
    "another feature of fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] is the reversal in the contrast between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene chains between low and intermediate bias : curve l is higher for the cf@xmath0styrene while curves e and h are higher for the och@xmath0styrene .",
    "this is possible because the transport mechanisms for the och@xmath0styrene in the low and intermediate bias regimes are different : the latter is dominated by resonant conduction via the molecular homo levels while the former is not . whether such a contrast reversal with increasing bias occurs or not was found in the present theoretical study to depend on the structures of the molecular chains : for the geometry shown at the top of fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_4struct ] ) the och@xmath0 groups lie especially low relative to the cf@xmath0 groups which makes it possible for the cf@xmath0styrene molecules to appear higher than the och@xmath0styrene at low negative substrate bias .",
    "this occurs despite the fact that both the molecular homo levels and the local si valence band edge are higher in energy on the och@xmath0styrene side of the heterowire . for some other geometries of the och@xmath0styrene / cf@xmath0styrene chain to be discussed in section [ relationship ] the och@xmath0 groups lie higher relative to the cf@xmath0 groups and no contrast reversal is found theoretically : the och@xmath0styrene appears higher than the cf@xmath0styrene even at low negative substrate bias . in experiment ,",
    "contrast reversal between the och@xmath0styrene and cf@xmath0styrene chains with changing bias was observed in some runs ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig_2expt ] ) but not in others ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig_1expt ] ) , most likely due to undetermined differences between the stm tips involved .",
    "a significant difference between the calculated current profiles in figs [ fig_5th ] and [ fig_6th ] and our experimental stm height profiles is that the latter do not show the quasiperiodic modulation with a period of roughly two molecular spacings seen in the calculated current profiles for the cf@xmath0styrene part of the chain .",
    "this difference can be understood as follows : this quasi - periodic modulation of the calculated cf@xmath0styrene chain current profile is a geometrical effect due to the differing orientations of the cf@xmath0 groups and also the associated differing tilts of the molecules along the cf@xmath0styrene chain described near the end of section [ structure ] .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect this modulation not to be visible in stm images taken at room temperature where the cf@xmath0 groups are rotating rapidly about their axes and the local phase of the spatial current modulation is therefore fluctuating rapidly so that only an average over many structures with different phases is observed on the time scale on which the stm scans are recorded , and thus a period equal to the molecular spacing is observed .",
    "the prominent peaks in the red current profiles e in figs [ fig_5th ] and [ fig_6th ] near the interface between the cf@xmath0styrene and och@xmath0styrene molecular chains have the following important characteristics : the peak for positive substrate bias in fig .",
    "[ fig_5th ] is narrow , just one molecule wide and occurs on the cf@xmath0styrene side of the junction .",
    "the peak at negative substrate bias in fig .",
    "[ fig_6th ] is broader , extending over a few molecules and occurs on the och@xmath0styrene side of the junction .",
    "these properties of the interfacial peak at negative substrate bias are consistent with the experimental data presented in section [ expt ] .",
    "furthermore the interfacial peak at negative substrate bias was seen experimentally at low bias in all of the many cf@xmath0styrene / och@xmath0styrene heterojunctions that we imaged and persisted when the stm tip changed spontaneously in the course of the imaging . by contrast , in empty state imaging ( i.e. , for positive substrate bias ) , no discernible height enhancement at the interface was usually observed .",
    "the above discussion in section [ positive ] identified the interfacial peaks in the calculated current profiles as being due to a maximum or minimum of the electrostatic contribution to the molecular homo or lumo energy along the molecular chain occurring at the location of the peak . however , in order to understand the physics underlying the differences between the predicted properties of the peaks at positive and negative substrate bias and the similarities and differences between the predictions and experiment it is necessary to examine how these features of the current profiles depend on the structure of the molecular chain .",
    "this will be explored in the next section .",
    "several significant aspects of the structures of the experimentally realized molecular chains such as whether the molecules are tethered to the si in the t or d orientation ( as defined in section [ geom ] ) and whether the och@xmath0 groups are t or d oriented , are not obvious from a direct inspection of the experimental stm images .",
    "it is also not clear theoretically which types of these structures should be favoured by the kinetics of the growth process or by energetics at room temperature .",
    "thus it is desirable to study a variety of plausible relaxed molecular chain geometries theoretically and to clarify how their structures relate to their electrostatic and current profiles .",
    "this is done in the present section and the results presented here also elucidate the mechanisms underlying the phenomena described in sections [ expt ] and [ case ] .",

    "systematic studies of various structures and their potential energy profiles showed the reversal of the slope of the potential energy profile along most the chain of benzene rings of the och@xmath0styrene chain from structure ( a ) to structure ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] should be attributed _ not _ to the och@xmath0 groups being switched from the t to the d orientation _ per se _ , but primarily to the fact that the _ projection onto the axis of the molecular chain _ of the dipole moment associated _ internal _ charge structures of the och@xmath0 groups ( negative o and positive ch@xmath0 ) has reversed direction from structure ( a ) to structure ( b ) as is evident from the geometries of the two structures in fig .",
    "[ fig_8th ] .",
    "this reversal of the charge structure along the molecular axis should lead to a reversal of the slope of the potential energy profile and this is what is in fact seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots ] .    in this way",
    "the change in the geometrical structure of the och@xmath0styrene chain has resulted in the shift of the potential energy maximum ( and stm tip current maximum at moderately low negative substrate bias ) from the vicinity of the heterojunction to the vicinity of the far end of the och@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "an important point to note is that because of the geometrical structure of the och@xmath0styrene molecules and the way in which they bond to the silicon the internal dipole moment of the och@xmath0 group has a strong component _",
    "parallel _ to the silicon surface and the och@xmath0 groups of all of the och@xmath0styrene molecules can be aligned in such a way that the projections of the och@xmath0 groups of _ all _ of these molecules onto the axis of the molecular chain have the same sign .",
    "this results in a gradual buildup of the electrostatic potential along the och@xmath0styrene chain and a _ broad _ electrostatic potential energy peak near one of its ends as in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots](a ) or ( b ) , and consequently a broad current peak under moderately low negative substrate bias , consistent with the experimental results presented in section [ expt ] .    by contrast , because the geometrical orientation of the cf@xmath0 group ( see fig . [ fig_4struct ] ) and the arrangement of charges within it are different than for the och@xmath0 group , and because of the repulsion between the f atoms on different molecules ( see the end of section [ structure ] ) , such a well ordered arrangement of dipole projections onto the axis of the molecular chain does not occur for the cf@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "thus the electrostatic potential energy minimum on the cf@xmath0styrene side of the heterojunction is a much more local phenomenon .",
    "its location is determined by the orientations of a few molecules surrounding it and by the fringing electrostatic field of the och@xmath0styrene chain that extends across the heterojunction into the cf@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "thus the electrostatic potential energy minimum on the cf@xmath0styrene side of the heterojunction is very narrow and its location is sensitive to the details of the local molecular geometry .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect any profile peak associated with it in stm imaging at room temperature ( at positive substrate bias ) , if present at all , to be more strongly impacted by thermal fluctuations in the molecular geometry and therefore less readily observed than the corresponding peak at negative substrate bias on the och@xmath0styrene side of the molecular chain .",
    "this is consistent with the differences between the experimental results obtained under positive and negative substrate bias that are presented in section [ expt ] .",

    "because in this work the growth of the och@xmath0styrene chain followed the growth of the cf@xmath0styrene , a charged dangling bond is normally expected to be present at the end of the och@xmath0styrene chain ( remote from the och@xmath0styrene / cf@xmath0styrene junction ) where the growth of the molecular chain terminated , as in previous experimental work on styrene chains on silicon.@xcite the electrostatic potential due to this charged dangling bond gives rise to enhancement of the height profile of the molecular chain in its vicinity in stm experiments as is discussed in ref . if alignment of och@xmath0styrene molecular dipoles as in structure ( b ) was occurring in the present experiments , the associated electrostatic profiles such as in fig .",

    "carrying out such a test was beyond the scope of the present experimental work .",
    "however , the fact that height enhancement was _ consistently _ observed experimentally near the och@xmath0styrene / cf@xmath0styrene heterojunction at low negative substrate bias suggests that och@xmath0styrene chains with dipole fields similar to that arising from structure ( a ) rather than structure ( b ) in fig .",

    "[ fig_8th](c ) , the other och@xmath0styrene molecules in structure ( c ) have a different geometry : they are tethered to the si in the d orientation and their och@xmath0 groups are in the t orientation . between the 8th and 9th och@xmath0styrene the molecules from the junction with the cf@xmath0styrene",
    "there is another abrupt change in the molecular geometry : although the molecules to the right and left of this dislocation are both d - tethered and the och@xmath0 s are t oriented , the molecules to the right of the fault tilt more to the right and their och@xmath0 groups are oriented nearly perpendicularly to the axis of the molecular chain .",
    "this is reflected in the electrostatic potential energy profile along the chain that is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots](c ) : since the molecular structure at the junction is similar to that for structure ( b ) the potential profile on the benzene rings is also similar there , i.e. , there is a sharp potential energy minimum at the cf@xmath0styrene molecule at the junction .",
    "since for och@xmath0styrene molecules 2 - 8 from the junction the orientation of the o and two c atoms bonded to it is similar to that for the och@xmath0styrene molecules in structure ( a ) the orientation of the relevant dipoles on that part of the chain is also similar and thus the potential energy profile is also qualitatively similar : there is a broad potential energy maximum on the och@xmath0styrene benzene rings peaked near the junction with the cf@xmath0styrene .",
    "however , the different orientation of the charged groups of the of the 9th-15th och@xmath0styrene molecules from the junction results in a reversal of the slope of the potential profile and the electronic potential energy on the och@xmath0styrene benzene rings rises to another maximum near the right hand end of the molecular chain .",
    "the calculated stm current profiles for structure ( c ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_10th ] are again consistent with the potential energy profile along the chain of benzene rings : at moderately low positive substrate bias ( violet curve e@xmath64 ) the current profile has a sharp maximum one molecule wide at the cf@xmath0styrene molecule where the potential energy minimum along the molecular chain is located . at moderately low negative substrate bias ( red curve e )",
    "there is a broad current maximum peaked on the och@xmath0styrene side of the junction where the potential energy has one of its maxima .",

    "this geometrical difference also shows up as a step in the other current profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig_10th ] at the dislocation in the och@xmath0styrene chain .    for structure ( c )",

    "thus one should expect a potential energy profile along the chain of och@xmath0styrene benzene rings somewhat similar to that for structure ( a ) . indeed the red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots](d ) does have its maximum in the och@xmath0styrene chain near the junction with the cf@xmath0styrene and it declines overall to the right , but the decline is modulated by strong oscillations due to the different tethering of alternate och@xmath0styrene molecules to the si .",
    "the potential energy profile along the chain of benzene rings on the cf@xmath0styrene chain of structure ( d ) is quite different than that for structures ( b ) and ( c ) : there is no potential energy minimum on the cf@xmath0styrene next to the junction but instead a shallow minimum near the middle of the cf@xmath0styrene chain .",
    "the current profiles for structure ( d ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_11th ] for moderately low positive substrate bias ( violet curve e@xmath64 ) and moderately low negative substrate bias ( red curve e ) .",
    "again the maxima of these profiles are near the lowest and highest points of the potential energy profile along the chain of benzene rings , respectively .",
    "but in this case the potential energy peak in the och@xmath0styrene chain is less prominent and narrower than in the the previously discussed cases due to the less uniform structure of the array of dipoles .",
    "the broad potential energy minimum in the cf@xmath0styrene results in a broader current peak at positive substrate bias than in the cases discussed earlier .",
    "this illustrates further the strong sensitivity of the cf@xmath0styrene chain s potential minima to the precise details of the conformation of a single molecule or a few molecules : in structure ( d ) the och@xmath0styrene molecule at the junction of the chains is d - tethered and the och@xmath0 group is t oriented while the reverse is true for structures ( b ) and ( c ) while the cf@xmath0 groups are rotated slightly differently and cf@xmath0styrene at the junction tilts somewhat differently .",
    "structure ( e ) is similar to structure ( a ) except that now the orientations of the och@xmath0 groups alternate between t and d and the cf@xmath0 groups have rotated about their axes through substantial angles . because of the alternating orientations of the och@xmath0 groups the electric fields due to the different och@xmath0styrene molecules are not aligned and produce a potential energy profile in fig .",
    "[ fig_7pots](e ) with a very broad maximum near the end of the chain remote from the junction .",

    "the och@xmath0styrene chains result in a strong modulation of the current with a period of 2 molecular spacings .",
    "since this modulation is not seen experimentally , either these structures are not realized in the experiments or the experiments are averaging over geometries for which the modulation occurs with different phases due to thermal fluctuations of the molecular geometries at room temperature .",

    "the origin of this effect is seen in the solid black curve labeled `` si '' in fig.[fig_13th](c ) : dipole fields associated with the cf@xmath0-styrene molecules lower the si orbital energies below the triple cf@xmath0-styrene by @xmath650.2ev more than under the single file cf@xmath0-styrene . at low bias",
    "this reduces the silicon electronic density of states near the silicon surface at the fermi level of the stm tip more under the triple cf@xmath0-styrene line than under the single cf@xmath0-styrene line , resulting in the weaker tip current through the former .",
    "as the magnitude of the bias increases eventually the tip fermi level is lowered further by an amount substantially exceeding the differential electrostatic energy shift between the si orbitals under the triple and single cf@xmath0-styrene lines and thus the contrast between the stm tip currents through the triple and single cf@xmath0-styrene lines becomes weaker as is seen in curve l of fig.[fig_13th](b ) for which the tip fermi level is 0.5ev lower than for curve v.    this behavior found in the simulations ( lower current through the triple cf@xmath0-styrene line than through the single cf@xmath0-styrene line at low bias and the reduction in this contrast with increasing magnitude of the bias ) is qualitatively similar to that seen experimentally in fig .",
    "[ fig_3expt](e ) .",
    "however , quantitatively the suppression of the current through the triple cf@xmath0-styrene line at low bias is more pronounced in the experiment ( fig .

    "[ fig_3expt](e ) at low bias ) normally corresponds to approximately a 2 - 3 orders of magnitude change in current at constant tip height in stm experiments .",
