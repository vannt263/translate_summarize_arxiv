    "ultracold atomic gases loaded into optical traps offer the unique possibility of experimentally simulating many of the fundamental models of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these systems are clean , and owing to remarkable advances in trapping , cooling , and the manipulation of inter- and intraparticle interactions , may be studied with an unprecedented level of experimental control .",
    "one of the field s landmark achievements has been the observation of the superfluid - mott insulator transition in bose gases @xcite .",
    "analogous successes with fermions have led to the direct observation of such phenomena as fermi pressure and antibunching @xcite .",
    "focus has now shifted to ultracold mixtures of bosons and fermions @xcite . at the most practical level , bosons may be used to sympathetically cool trapped fermions @xcite .",
    "much more tantalizing , however , is the prospect that bosons may be able to mediate a bcs superfluid transition in ultracold fermi gases @xcite , or emulate many - body hamiltonians of mixture systems predicted to exhibit a plethora of exotic phases @xcite . equally intriguing is the possibility of using newly created `` bose - fermi molecules '' with permanent dipole moments as qubits for quantum computers or as probes of the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron @xcite .",
    "these possibilities have galvanized both experimentalists and theorists to develop new tools capable of exploring the full range of mixture phenomenology .    from a theoretical standpoint , delineating the exact finite - temperature bose - fermi phase diagram represents a formidable challenge .",
    "mean - field and perturbation theory calculations suggest that bose - fermi mixtures may exhibit a wide variety of behaviors , ranging from bose - fermi `` molecule '' spin and charge density waves to phase segregation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these techniques are approximate by definition , which raises concerns about the phase diagrams they yield .",
    "a reliable description of bose - fermi mixture phenomenology requires an exact framework capable of accurately accounting for strong correlation among particles .",
    "accurate results can be obtained for small clusters whose limited hilbert spaces are amenable to exact diagonalization ( ed ) , and linear chains for which quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques free of the sign problem or density matrix renormalization group methods may be applied @xcite . techniques for large systems in two and higher dimensions , however , are scarce .    the most promising and flexible technique for mixtures to date uses the framework of dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . while initial applications of dmft to mixtures paired well - established dmft methods for fermions with approximate treatments of bosons @xcite , the first rigorous bose - fermi dmft algorithm has recently been proposed , which weds fermion dmft with a newly - derived dmft approach for bosons @xcite . as with all dmft approaches , this technique is only expected to be accurate in the limit of large dimensionality or coordination number .",
    "indeed , recent boson - dmft ( bdmft ) calculations on the bose - hubbard model demonstrate that , while dmft is remarkably accurate in three dimensions , it is less so in two dimensions @xcite . furthermore , because dmft is most useful for systems with short - range correlations , inhomogeneous phases and long - wavelength collective modes may present additional challenges .",
    "in contrast , qmc techniques offer the promise of being exact regardless of system size , dimensionality , and homogeneity .",
    "qmc techniques differ widely in detail from algorithm to algorithm , but all employ stochastic sampling to solve the schrdinger equation at zero temperature or determine partition and correlation functions at finite temperatures . because of their accuracy and modest computational cost , qmc methods such as the worldline and worm algorithms have become the techniques of choice for boson lattice models @xcite .",
    "auxiliary - field and diagrammatic qmc techniques also exist for fermions @xcite . unlike techniques for bosons , however , fermion qmc in two or more dimensions is generally plagued by the sign problem , resulting in an exponential scaling of computational cost with inverse temperature to achieve a fixed accuracy @xcite . developing a widely - applicable qmc technique for mixtures",
    "thus requires not only marrying two considerably different fermion and boson techniques together , but finding a way to tame the sign problem within that combined formalism .    widely employed in condensed matter and nuclear physics , the auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( afqmc ) method @xcite is a field theoretical method where many - body propagators resulting from two - body interactions are transformed into many - dimensional integrals over one - body propagators using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xcite .",
    "the resulting integrals are then computed using monte carlo sampling . in recent years",
    ", afqmc has predominantly been used to study the equilibrium properties of the hubbard model both at finite - temperature and in the ground - state . like all fermion qmc techniques ,",
    "conventional afqmc suffers from the sign problem in most parameter regimes .",
    "however , an alternative formulation , in which walkers are pruned using population control techniques as they sample afs in imaginary time , has allowed a general , efficient approach to treat both local and extended interactions .",
    "this framework allows the constrained - path and phaseless approximations to be easily incorporated to control the sign and phase problems @xcite . in recent years",
    ", these approximations have been tested on a variety of systems including the hubbard model @xcite and the electronic structure of solids and molecules @xcite and has been shown to yield accurate energies and correlation functions .",
    "thus , constrained - path afqmc ( cpmc ) is well - equipped to explore phases beyond the scope of other fermion qmc methods .",
    "the formalism of afqmc has also previously been generalized to treat bosons in the ground state @xcite .",
    "this suggests that afqmc would be perfectly suited for studying mixtures via a combination of bosonic and fermionic monte carlo techniques if the formalism could be further expanded to treat bosons at finite temperatures .    in this work ,",
    "we present an exact qmc methodology that can be used to determine the thermodynamic properties of bose - fermi mixtures in any dimension over a wide range of parameters .",
    "our method , bose - fermi auxiliary field quantum monte carlo ( bf - afqmc ) , generalizes finite - temperature afqmc for fermions to bosons and bose - fermi mixtures . by casting the bosonic portion of the problem in terms of auxiliary fields",
    ", we can extend determinantal qmc techniques to bosons and sample the boson partition function by sampling determinants just as one would for fermions .",
    "we arrive at an exact technique for mixtures by combining our approach for bosons with previous afqmc techniques for fermions .",
    "we then discuss how the constrained path and phaseless approximations can be imposed to remove the sign and phase problems in our method . as a benchmark",
    ", we compare our algorithm s results for bose - hubbard and spin - polarized bose - fermi - hubbard clusters to those obtained using ed .",
    "we also contrast our results with those from mean - field theory ( mft ) and the worm algorithm .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we begin by reviewing the afqmc formalism for fermions as background for our new algorithm .",
    "we then proceed to present the underlying formalism for our new boson and bose - fermi algorithms in section iii , including importance sampling schemes .",
    "we also outline the implementation of the constrained path and phaseless approximations , which can respectively control the sign and phase problems . in section iv",
    ", we compare our algorithm s results for the bose - hubbard and spin - polarized bose - fermi hubbard models against those produced using alternative methods in an effort to demonstrate the accuracy of our technique .",
    "we finally conclude in section v , leaving the derivation of the expression relating the boson partition function to a determinant and other details to the appendices .",
    "to facilitate the subsequent discussion , we use the following form of the bose - fermi - hubbard hamiltonian as a concrete example @xmath0 where @xmath1 contains all one - body boson terms @xmath2 @xmath3 contains all one - body fermion terms @xmath4 @xmath5 contains two - body boson terms , @xmath6 @xmath7 contains two - body fermion terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 represents the bose - fermi coupling term @xmath10 in the above , @xmath11 denote the boson creation and annihilation operators and @xmath12 the fermion creation and annihilation operators with spin @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) at site @xmath16 .",

    "this hamiltonian can exhibit the full range of bose - fermi phenomenology .",
    "more general hamiltonians may be handled by the approach outlined below .",
    "the finite - temperature afqmc method for fermions calculates the thermodynamic properties of a system of particles with two - body interactions by reexpressing two - body propagators as integrals over one - body propagators and a set of auxiliary fields .",
    "here , we review the basic formalism to acquaint the reader with previous work relevant to the following discussion @xcite . in general , the finite - temperature expectation value of an observable , @xmath27 , may be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath30 .",

    "each short - time propagator is thus a product of two one - body propagators and one two - body propagator . in our hamiltonian , @xmath38 this form allows the two - body propagators to be reexpressed in terms of an integral over a product of one - body propagators and a set of auxiliary fields using the hubbard - stratonovich ( hs ) transformation @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an auxiliary - field ( af ) .",
    "note that , while there are discrete versions of the hs transformation for the form of @xmath7 in our hamiltonian , we have outlined a continuous version which formally resembles the transformation we will use for @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "this expression for the short - time propagator may be further simplified by viewing the collection of fields at each timeslice as a vector of fields , @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of lattice sites , and the normalized gaussians at each site as probabilities , @xmath43 . collecting all one - body operators into @xmath44",

    "the set of fields at each timeslice and site constitutes a path in af space .",
    "thus , in afqmc , one calculates the multi - dimensional partition function by stochastically sampling a set of paths in af space and evaluating the weighted average of the trace along those paths .",

    "there are only two formal differences between b - afqmc and standard fermion afqmc : the minus sign in front of the product of the one - body propagators , and the inverse in the determinant . these differences , however , have a large impact on how the b - afqmc algorithm is implemented compared to standard afqmc .",
    "as discussed in detail in appendix b , the new form of the green s function requires that adjustments be made to the way one stabilizes products of one - body matrices at low temperatures , while the new form of the determinant requires that adjustments be made to the way local - updates to the green s function are computed and weights are accumulated as fields are selected at each timeslice and site . except for these adjustments , b - afqmc maps formally and directly onto previous afqmc algorithms .",
    "to combine afqmc and b - afqmc into a procedure for mixtures , one needs to decouple the bose - fermi coupling term in eq .",

    "[ eq : vb ] .",
    "an important way to improve the efficiency of bf - afqmc simulations is to subtract any background terms prior to the hs transformation . in both boson and fermion ground - state calculations ,",
    "this was shown to greatly reduce the qmc statistical fluctuations and the severity of the sign and phase problems @xcite .",

    "[ simplifiedbfhequation ] contains three terms quadratic in the boson and fermion densities , three hs transformations must be used at each timeslice and site to reduce these terms to one - body operators .",
    "the boson and fermion green s functions may analogously be written as above , but with one - body matrices that now contain their respective contributions from the coupling terms .",
    "thus , in bf - afqmc , a generic bose - fermi hamiltonian may be simulated by first rewriting all coupling terms such that they can be transformed into independent boson and fermion propagators .",
    "once the propagators are repartitioned , the individual boson and fermion green s functions may then be evaluated as if there was no coupling term , so long as paths are sampled from the full bose - fermi partition function .",
    "determinants are computed using a set of walkers whose weights and green s functions are determined as each field is sampled _ sequentially _ in imaginary time . at the beginning of our simulations , we initialize the weights , @xmath82 , of a collection of walkers to 1 .",

    "the trial hamiltonian is typically the exact hamiltonian minus any terms quadratic in the density ( @xmath86 terms , after background subtraction ) .",
    "since the chemical potential corresponding to some desired filling differs between the trial and exact hamiltonians , care must be taken to determine the appropriate chemical potential for the trial hamiltonian before sampling proceeds so as to prevent additional statistical fluctuations .    as each field ( or fields , if multiple hs transformations are performed ) is selected at site @xmath16 and timeslice @xmath87 , the weights of the walkers are multiplied by a factor , @xmath88 . in the absence of importance sampling ( see below ) , @xmath88 is the ratio of the product of the newly - updated determinants to the old determinants .",

    "iii.b above .",
    "then , the weight may be defined as @xmath93 the final product of these factors over all sampled fields is proportional to the product of boson and fermion determinants for the full path that we wish to sample . as each field",
    "is sampled , the green s functions are also updated by replacing the trial one - body matrices with the exact one - body matrices based upon the fields",
    ". the corresponding green s function matrix , after sampling field @xmath16 at timeslice @xmath87 , would therefore be @xmath94 and @xmath95 all trial matrices are replaced until all fields are sampled and the green s functions correspond to those for the exact hamiltonian . after all fields are sampled , average observables are computed .",
    "the weights and green s functions are then reinitialized to their starting values and fields are sampled again until the desired number of samples have been collected .",
    "of course , if the fields are drawn randomly according to @xmath96 , the ratios in eq .",
    "[ noimpsampling ] will cancel in successive steps , and our sampling procedure above will be identical to simply sampling entire paths of afs randomly and then calculating the determinants in eq .",
    "[ eq : zbf ] as weights of the paths .",
    "the advantage of the sampling scheme above is that it allows importance sampling to be done efficiently and , as we discuss in the next subsection , constrained path and phaseless approximations to be easily incorporated to control sign and phase problems @xcite .",
    "importance sampling uses an estimated contribution based on a trial wave function or density matrix to guide the sampling of afs @xcite . just as gains in efficiency",
    "may be obtained by subtracting the average density from the exact density in each hs - transformed propagator , even further gains may be obtained by subtracting a site - dependent shift , @xmath97 , from the auxiliary - field , @xmath98 .",
    "this shift , called a force bias , effectively modifies the probability @xmath99 for sampling @xmath100 , to take into account the af paths that have been built up so far , i.e. , the prior @xmath101 values ( from @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "the shift is added by performing a change of variable in the usual hs transformation .",
    "for example , the boson 2-body term , after absorbing the contribution from @xmath77 and background subtraction , can be written as @xmath104 where shift- and field - related constants may be regrouped into an additional weighting term , @xmath105 , that contributes to eq . [ noimpsampling ] .",
    "the one - body operator is now also a function of the shift .",
    "optimal importance sampling is achieved when the shift is chosen such that the fluctuations in the weights of the walkers are minimized . at finite - temperatures",

    "[ examplecoefficient2 ] , @xmath108 .",
    "shifts may be calculated in this way for each hs transformation .",
    "this importance sampling technique enables us to simulate well into the moderate - coupling regime with high - efficiency , _ free of any approximations_.",
    "as alluded to earlier , a phase problem develops whenever complex propagators produce complex determinants . when sampled by walkers , these complex determinants in turn yield complex walker weights .",
    "although background subtraction and importance sampling , as discussed above , can help reduce statistical fluctuations , the phase problem will eventually overwhelm any simulation at sufficiently low temperatures or sufficiently large repulsive interactions .",
    "the signature of the sign or phase problem is that the weights will populate both positive and negative values on the real axis ( sign problem ) or arbitrary phase angles in the complex plane , resulting in dramatic cancellation and large fluctuations .",
    "the phase problem may be avoided with the phaseless approximation , an approximation that renders the weights of complex walkers real via a gauge transformation using a trial wave function or density matrix @xcite .    in the phaseless approximation ,",
    "one first uses importance sampling as described in section iii.c to minimize the phase of the weighting factor at each step ( timeslice and site ) . without importance sampling , the weighting factor is given by eq .",
    "[ noimpsampling ] . with importance sampling , it becomes @xmath109 with the optimal choice of force bias , as we discussed in eq .",
    "[ eq : optimal_fb ] , it can be shown that the overall phase accumulation is proportional to @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the so - called local energy @xcite . in the case of the exact trial wave function or density matrix , the imaginary part of @xmath111 vanishes .",
    "once the phase is optimally reduced , the phaseless approximation omits the overall phase .",
    "it then projects the random walk to the real axis to constrain the overall phase to one gauge choice . in the finite - temperature phaseless approximation",
    ", we define the phase rotation angle @xmath112 as @xmath113 the phase angle may more generally be defined in terms of the ratios of both the boson and fermion determinants , however we find that the phase problem may typically be attributed to boson fluctuations in the hamiltonians studied here .",
    "we then multiply the modulus of the weighting factor , @xmath114 by 0 if @xmath115 and @xmath116 otherwise .",
    "this keeps the walker weights real , preventing the mass cancellation of weights symptomatic of a bad phase problem .",
    "in addition to the phase problem from bosons , a mixture simulation may also encounter the sign problem for fermions at low temperatures @xcite , which is a special case of the phase problem .",
    "the phaseless approximation in the case of a real hs transformation and real determinants reduces to the constrained - path approximation @xcite .",
    "we use this approximation to curb the sign problem in this situation .",

    "in this section , we present illustrative results from our bose - fermi afqmc method .",
    "results are compared to those obtained from ed , mft , and the boson worm algorithm @xcite . except where indicated ,",

    "indeed , it only reproduces the exact condensate fractions throughout this limited temperature range for @xmath127 . as illustrated below in fig .",
    "[ 2dworm ] , even in situations where mean - field condensate fractions are nearly exact , energies produced using mft may be unreliable .",

    "[ 3sitebhedqmcphaseless ] , we show that we obtain the same results with improved statistics using these techniques for @xmath128 . using importance sampling and the phaseless approximation ,",
    "our error bars on the number of bosons for the same number of samples are at least halved compared to those obtained without importance sampling .",
    "error bars on other quantities are too small to judge . in previous works ,",
    "importance sampling was observed to greatly reduce the error bars in finite - temperature fermion calculations @xcite .",
    "similarly , in ground state boson calculations , an order of magnitude or more improvement in efficiency is seen @xcite .",
    "our phaseless calculations for finite - temperature bosons therefore do not see the dramatic error bar reductions seen in other applications .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "the system size is small , such that the variations in the sampled space are much reduced compared to larger systems , where the effect of importance sampling is expected to increase significantly .",
    "the present boson finite - temperature calculations are performed in the grand canonical ensemble , which could contribute to increased fluctuations .",
    "the main contribution to the statistical fluctuations in the boson calculations is likely from the so - called  rogue eigenvalue \" problem which we discuss in the next section .    for larger lattices",
    ", we compare to the worm algorithm .",
    "[ 2dworm ] demonstrates that b - afqmc energies are consistent with worm energies for 2d systems of varying sizes for several @xmath22 .",
    "interestingly , as alluded to above , qmc and mft energies differ dramatically at all but the highest of temperatures .",
    "this is even so when the energies are normalized to account for the fact that the qmc and mft algorithms require different chemical potentials to achieve the same fixed boson number .",
    "[ 2dworm ] may readily be extended to larger lattices and boson - boson repulsions , but at the price of the increased sampling needed to surmount the phase problem .",
    "in order to illustrate our bose - fermi afqmc method , we similarly apply our technique to the bose - fermi - hubbard model , the standard model for studying ultracold mixture phenomenology .",
    "as mentioned before , here , we limit ourselves to the spin - polarized hamiltonian , namely eq .",
    "[ simplifiedbfhequation ] with @xmath129 .    as with the bose - hubbard model",
    ", collapse is anticipated for @xmath130 and any value of @xmath24 for densities sufficiently large that the boson - boson attraction term dominates the linear coupling term .",
    "if @xmath131 and the boson - boson interaction does not dominate , collapse may also be observed for a sufficiently large and negative @xmath24 .",
    "the phase problem is observed whenever @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "we thus again simulate amidst the phase problem so as to at once avoid collapse and demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm despite complex phases .",
    "as our first example , we consider a 2-site bose - fermi - hubbard model with varying @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 . we find that our results for the potential energies , kinetic energies , condensate fractions , and double occupancies per site @xcite agree with ed to within small error bars for @xmath137 values up to 13 .",
    "@xmath137 ratios up to 7 are shown in fig .",
    "[ 2sitebfhall ] for the sake of clarity .",
    "these results demonstrate the correctness of our algorithm and implementation , and that exact computations are feasible for moderate coupling strengths amidst an appreciable phase problem .",
    "we expect that our ability to calculate observables amidst such large phase problems will diminish with larger system sizes where fewer samples may be taken within a fixed time .",
    "more sophisticated sampling techniques , better handling of the  rogue eigenvalue problem \" ( see below ) , and the use of the phaseless approximation will drastically improve the statistical accuracy .",
    "lastly , as a check on our mixture algorithm for larger systems sizes , we compare to results from mft in the limit of small @xmath22 and @xmath24 . our results in fig .",
    "[ 2dbfmftqmc ] are in concurrence with those from mft for up to 8x8 systems ( larger sizes are not pictured here ) .",
    "a similar comparison , not presented here , was made for the bose - hubbard hamiltonian and yielded analogous results . in both cases ,",
    "mft results compare well with qmc results until the two begin to deviate at lower temperatures , as expected . because there are a limited number of exact methods for multidimensional mixtures to which we can compare , we reserve further mixture examples and applications for a future publication .",
    "as the results presented in this work demonstrate , our algorithm represents , in principle , an exact method for simulating the thermodynamic behavior of an essentially arbitrary lattice system composed of interacting bosons and fermions .",
    "nevertheless , its performance is still hindered by several practical challenges .",
    "one of the more benign challenges relates to the estimation of the correct chemical potentials for desired fillings . in order to simulate a mixture with the desired fillings in the grand canonical ensemble",
    ", one must estimate not only the correct fermion chemical potential , but the correct boson chemical potential as well .",
    "this task is particularly laborious for bosons since their fillings may change especially rapidly with chemical potential .",
    "when fillings change more gradually with chemical potential , such as in the mott insulator or normal liquid regimes , iterative methods may be employed . outside of such regimes , particularly near or in superfluid phases ,",
    "such methods fail because incorrect or unphysical chemical potentials may yield seemingly correct fillings within error bars .    a second challenge to our algorithm",
    "is posed by the phase problem . as discussed in section iii.d ,",
    "whenever propagators become complex , walker weights and green s functions acquire a complex phase .",
    "when this phase grows particularly large , controlling statistical fluctuations becomes a computational challenge .",
    "the severity of the phase problem depends upon the model and simulation parameters . for the bose - hubbard model , the phase problem develops for positive @xmath22 ; for the bose - fermi - hubbard model",
    "it is present whenever @xmath132 or @xmath133 . as with the related sign problem in fermion qmc",
    ", the severity of the phase problem grows exponentially with system size or inverse temperature .",
    "this means that for large systems and at low temperatures , we need to properly impose constraints that systematically bias the results .",
    "the performance of the constraint in ground state calculations should provide a `` lower bound '' to the quality of the approximation in these finite - temperature calculations .",
    "as was previously discussed , importance sampling can significantly reduce statistical fluctuations , and where importance sampling fails , the phaseless approximation may be invoked .",
    "however , how the approximation performs across a phase transition , especially when the constraining trial density matrix is poor , remains to be studied .",
    "perhaps the biggest issue in the present formulation relates to the fact that in the grand canonical ensemble boson numbers may fluctuate in an unbounded manner . in the auxiliary - field formalism , the many - body problem is turned into multiple independent - particle problems in external fields . by fluctuation of the external fields , the target chemical potential may be too high for a particular independent - particle path , which would result in a condensate with an infinite number of particles .",
    "we have termed this the `` rogue eigenvalue problem . ''    as seen in eq .",
    "[ keybosonrelation ] , our boson partition function is expressed as a determinant of a matrix whose denominator may approach or fall below zero .",
    "this happens whenever the largest eigenvalue of the product of one - body boson matrices approaches or surpasses unity .",
    "although it is unphysical for the leading eigenvalue to surpass one - and indeed , it never does in our completely deterministic mean - field calculations - our walkers may stochastically sample such unphysical paths and their related `` rogue eigenvalues . ''",
    "walkers whose eigenvalues have surpassed one at any point in imaginary time possess corrupted paths that develop appreciable phase problems more severe than those seen in fermion systems and unique to simulations of bosons in the grand canonical ensemble . this is the leading challenge which impacts the effectiveness of the algorithm even in the presence of importance sampling and the phaseless approximation . in order to obtain sensible results well into condensed phases where eigenvalues may approach one on physical grounds",
    ", we must therefore prevent walkers from sampling rogue paths .",
    "one facile method for suppressing rogue paths used to produce many of the figures in this paper involved using larger @xmath138 values than the mean - field values . instead of setting @xmath138 in eq .",
    "[ eq : mfbg_sub ] to the sum of the mean - field densities at a given site , we set it to larger values that increase the effective chemical potential seen by the green s functions .",
    "this reduces the risk of a rogue eigenvalue problem at the cost of increased phase fluctuations , which can be surmounted by increased averaging .",
    "further details about this approach and more sophisticated ones will be presented in an upcoming publication .",
    "in this work , we have outlined a new algorithm that enables the exact calculation of the thermodynamic properties of bf mixtures in multiple dimensions over a wide range of parameters .",
    "this algorithm enables us to sample the boson partition function and calculate boson expectation values much as one would sample the fermion partition function and calculate fermion expectation values using conventional fermion afqmc .",
    "our method is , in principle , exact and we have demonstrated its accuracy by comparing our results to those obtained via ed and mft for the bose - hubbard and spin - polarized bose - fermi hubbard models .",
    "approximations need only be invoked when stochastic errors stemming from the sign and phase problems become uncontrollable . because our algorithm is at once exact and computationally tractable , we believe it is uniquely positioned to answer many open questions about the bose - fermi phase diagram and recent mixture experiments .",
    "our algorithm is particularly well - suited for the study of inhomogenous phases with long - range correlations , which can not be reliably captured by mean - field approaches .",
