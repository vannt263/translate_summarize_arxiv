    "is a bright , narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy in the ursa major cluster , lying at a tully - fisher distance of 15.2 mpc ( russell 2003 ) , with a heliocentric velocity of 753 km s@xmath0 ( verheijen 2001 ) .",
    "the rapid and large amplitude variability ( lawrence  1985,1987 ) was strong early evidence that the powerful x - radiation found to be a common property of seyfert galaxies by ariel 5 ( cooke  1976 , elvis  1978 ) and uhuru ( tananbaum 1978 ) observations resulted from accretion onto a central supermassive black hole .",
    "subsequent monitoring with  revealed a different aspect of , where it occasionally lapses into extended periods of low and quasi - constant x - ray emission ( lamer  2003 ) .",
    "more recently , high resolution x - ray spectra provided by  and  have shown that  also exhibits a strong ionised outflow .",
    "an early  hetg observation resolved two x - ray absorption line systems , with outflowing velocities of photoionised gas of @xmath1600 and @xmath12300 km s@xmath0 , while contemporaneous hst spectra of civ , nv and siiv found several absorption systems with velocities from @xmath130 km s@xmath0 to @xmath1650 km s@xmath0 ( collinge 2001 ) .",
    "of particular interest in the context of the present analysis , where we find a clear correlation of velocity and ionisation parameter , the higher velocity x - ray component had no counterpart in the uv spectra .",
    "the  data also showed an unresolved fe k emission line at @xmath16.41 kev ( fwhm @xmath22800 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "observations of  with  in 2001 and 2002 coincided with periods of relatively high and low x - ray flux , offering an opportunity to further explore the complexity of its x - ray spectrum .",
    "pounds  ( 2004 ) , hereafter po04 , found the hard x - ray band to be dominated by reflection from cold matter , which could also explain a non - varying , narrow fe k fluorescent line .",
    "a soft x - ray narrow emission line spectrum evident at low continuum fluxes , with observed wavelengths consistent with the  rest frame , indicated an extended ionised emission region , while a dominant absorption line spectrum in the high flux rgs observation of 2001 showed an ionised outflow with a line of sight velocity of @xmath1500 km s@xmath0 .",
    "an fe k absorption line in the epic spectrum indicated the presence of a more highly ionised outflow component with a velocity some 10 or 30 times higher , depending on the ionisation state being fexxvi or fexxv .",
    "most recently , steenbrugge  ( 2009 ) have reported the analysis of  letg observations in 2001 and 2003 , finding evidence for a more complex ionised outflow , with low ionisation components ( log@xmath3@xmath10.1 and log@xmath3@xmath10.5 - 0.9 ) outflowing at v@xmath1200 - 330 km s@xmath0 , a more highly ionised component of log@xmath3@xmath12 at v@xmath1600 km s@xmath0 and a high ionisation component ( log@xmath3@xmath13 ) at v@xmath14600 km s@xmath0 .",
    "those authors find no evidence for recombination in 3 of the 4 ionisation components up to 20 ks after a sudden , factor - of-5 drop in x - ray flux , indicating their location at a radial distance @xmath4@xmath5 cm for the higher velocity gas and @xmath4@xmath6 cm for the lowest velocity absorption in ov .",
    "we note that these minimum radii conflict with those from a similar time variability analysis of krongold  ( 2007 ) , and have the incidental bonus of removing the conceptual problem in krongold  where the local escape velocity exceeded the measured outflow value .",
    "evidence for much higher velocity x - ray outflows ( chartas  2002 , pounds   2003 , 2006 ; reeves  2003 , cappi 2006 , tombesi  2010 ) has been confined to the very highly ionised matter ( log@xmath3@xmath13.54 ) most readily detected in the fe k band .",
    "the high velocities and high column densities in these fe k band observations are thought to offer the best prospect that such energetic flows represent a significant feedback mechanism to constrain the continued growth of a black hole and star formation in the host galaxy , although to date only in the case of the bright qso pg1211 + 143 has the requisite wide angle flow and large covering factor been directly observed ( pounds and reeves 2009 ) . in the case of in contrast ,",
    "krongold  ( 2007 ) concluded that the low velocity gas has a small covering factor and hence involves a relatively insignificant mass and energy rate .",
    "while steenbrugge ( 2009 ) do not confirm the high density and small radial distance of the ionised outflow , they also derive a low mass and energy rate from the soft x - ray spectrum of .",
    "in this paper we report an analysis of a new  study of  with substantially greater sensitivity than hitherto , finding a rich absorption line spectrum revealing a velocity - structured outflow covering a wide range in velocity and ionisation parameter .",
    "we re - examine the suggestion in po04 that both high and low velocity absorption lines arise at different stages of a mass - conserved outflow .",
    "our new assessment considers the new data in the context of a high velocity , highly ionised wind being slowed by interaction with the interstellar medium , losing much of its mechanical energy in the resulting shock , while retaining momentum to push low ionisation gas out into the host galaxy ( king 2010 ) .",
    "we note that the same ideas would apply to an outflow colliding with earlier , slower moving ejecta .",
    "the wider importance of such shocked outflows , perhaps launched during an eddington accretion episode ( king and pounds 2003 ) , lies in the possibility that the accumulated thrust from multiple episodes - rather than the outflow energy - would eventually drive gas from the bulge , thereby limiting further star formation and black hole growth .",
    "such a momentum - driven feedback mechanism has been shown by king ( 2003,2005 ) to reproduce the observed correlation of black hole and galaxy masses ( e.g. ferrarese and merritt 2000 , gebhardt  2000 , haring and rix 2004 ) ) .",
    "was observed by  on 15 orbits between 2009 may 3 and june 15 .",
    "here we use mainly the soft x - ray data from the reflection grating spectrometer / rgs ( den herder  2001 ) , while also checking for evidence of a more highly ionised outflow in the epic pn ( strder 2001 ) and mos ( turner  2001 ) spectra . excluding high background data near the end of each orbit",
    "the net exposures available for spectral fitting were typically 40 ks per orbit , yielding an overall exposure of @xmath1600 ks ( pn ) and @xmath11.2 ms ( combined mos and rgs ) , factors of @xmath16 and @xmath112 higher than in the  observations of 2001 and 2002 . in the present paper",
    "we use spectra integrated over whole orbits , and note the mean orbit flux levels cover a similar range to the ` bright ' and ` faint ' observations of 2001 and 2002 .",
    "full details on the timing , flux levels and x - ray light curves for each revolution are included in an accompanying paper on the ` rapid x - ray variability of ' by vaughan  ( 2010 ) .",
    "figure 1 contrasts the rgs spectrum at representative high ( revs 1727 - 1730 ) and low ( revs 1725,36,39 ) flux levels during the 2009 observation .",
    "the distinction found previously ( po04 ) is again evident , with a dominant absorption line spectrum seen against the stronger continuum when bright , and an emission line spectrum emerging more clearly when the continuum is faint .",
    "the most obvious absorption lines are associated with h- and he - like ions of c , n , o and ne , and multiple velocity components are seen for several resonance transitions .",
    "the emission spectrum is also better defined than in any earlier observation of , benefiting from the long exposures of the 2009 observation .",
    "reference to figure 1 also shows a broad trough in the rgs spectrum between @xmath115.5 - 16.8  , present in both high and low flux data , which we attribute to a uta from fe - l absorption in low ionisation matter .",
    "inclusion of this uta casts doubt on the reality of a relativistic emission line of oviii lyman-@xmath7 , previously reported for  by ogle  ( 2004 ) and steenbrugge  ( 2009 ) .    in analysing the 2001  absorption spectrum of , po04 first subtracted line emission determined in the low flux spectrum of 2002 .",
    "however , in the 2009  data the low flux spectrum still shows residual absorption .",
    "we therefore adopted a different approach , by first modelling the emission spectrum in the low flux data and retaining the measured emission parameters in fitting the high flux absorption spectrum .",
    "a representative ` highflux ' spectrum was obtained by integrating rgs 1 and rgs 2 data from the 4 orbital revolutions 1727 - 1730 , while broad resonance emission lines and radiative recombination continua ( rrc ) were determined from a representative ` lowflux ' spectrum ( revs 1725 , 1736 and 1739 ) .",
    "the ` highflux ' continuum was first modelled by a power law ( @xmath8@xmath13.5 ) , with broad emission features added as observed in the low flux spectrum .",
    "individual absorption lines were then fitted with negative gaussians , with wavelength , line width and amplitude as free parameters .",
    "we discuss the emission line spectrum of  in more detail in a separate paper ( pounds and vaughan 2011 ; hereafter paper ii ) . for the present purposes , in order to quantify the absorption line spectrum in the highflux state , we simply represent the broad line emission component of each principal resonance line with a positive gaussian , with parameters determined in the corresponding lowflux spectrum .",
    "figure 2 ( top panel ) illustrates the lowflux spectrum in the region of the oviii lyman-@xmath7 line ( rest wavelength 18.97 ) .",
    "a broad emission line is clearly resolved , with substantial absorption near the line core . fitting a positive gaussian to",
    "the broad emission component finds a rest wavelength of 18.96@xmath9 0.02  , 1@xmath10 line width of 90@xmath9 9 m  and amplitude of @xmath11 photons @xmath12 s@xmath0 @xmath0 .",
    "the median wavelength indicates a velocity blueshift of @xmath1750@xmath9200 km s@xmath0 while , allowing for the rgs 1 resolution ( @xmath10=28 m  at 19 ) , the line width corresponds to @xmath13100@xmath9400 km s@xmath0 fwhm , if interpreted purely as velocity broadening .",
    "figure 2 ( lower panel ) shows the same spectral region near the oviii lyman-@xmath7 line , with a complex of absorption lines superimposed on the continuum plus broad line emission . a sweep across the 1820   waveband with a negative gaussian of width initially set to the rgs resolution , found 3 strong and 3 weaker absorptions lines , located at wavelengths labelled ( a ) - ( f ) in the figure .",
    "however , it is apparent that the absorption structure is only approximately matched by gaussian lines , with the broad opacity between @xmath118.5 - 18.8   suggesting a spread of velocities .",

    "we note that the probable blend of component ( c ) with the ovii 1s-3p line ( rest wavelength 18.63  ) renders the parameters of that component uncertain . however , velocity components a , b and c are all independently supported by their detection in oviii lyman-@xmath13 ( table 2 ) .",
    "the weaker absorption lines labelled ( e ) and ( f ) in figure 2 are most likely due inner shell transitions in ovi ( rest wavelengths 19.18    and 19.34  ; holczer  2009 ) , and we note a further possible satellite line in ov ( 19.97  ) , all 3 low ionisation lines yielding a low outflow velocity .    in summary , we find evidence for 3 , or possibly 4 blue - shifted velocities in oviii lyman-@xmath7 , with a clear separation between the component at @xmath1780 km s@xmath0 and components at @xmath14100 and @xmath15600 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the lowflux spectrum in the region of the ovii 1s-2p triplet also shows a strong and broad emission feature ( figure 3 , top panel ) , together with a narrow emission line readily identified with the forbidden transition ( rest wavelength 22.101  ) . fitting a gaussian to the narrow line",

    "we find the ovii forbidden line to be marginally blue - shifted , with a velocity of -125@xmath940 km s@xmath0 , and to be unresolved by rgs1 , the 1 @xmath10 upper limit corresponding to a velocity width of @xmath1250 km s@xmath0 fwhm .",
    "a single gaussian fit to the broad emission from the ovii 1s-2p triplet finds a rest wavelength of 21.8@xmath90.1  , line width @xmath10=305@xmath935 m   and amplitude @xmath15 photons @xmath12 s@xmath0 @xmath0 .",
    "the intrinsic width , corresponding to a velocity width of @xmath19500 km s@xmath0 ( fwhm ) , is clearly much larger than that found for oviii lyman-@xmath7 . however , a more detailed analysis of the emission spectrum in paper ii finds broad emission components for both the ovii resonance ( 21.602 ) and intercombination ( 21.807  ) lines , with component line widths comparable to that found here for oviii lyman-@xmath7 .",
    "for the present purposes of quantifying the highflux absorption spectrum we retain the single emission profile , shown added to the best - fit continuum in figure 3 ( lower panel ) .",
    "six absorption lines are detected in the region of the ovii triplet , all but that near 22.75   being of width consistent with the rgs resolution .",
    "those labelled ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) are identified as blue - shifted components of the ovii 1s-2p resonance line , the individual blue shifts yielding line - of - sight outflow velocities of -440@xmath960 km s@xmath0 , -4080@xmath9140 km s@xmath0 , and -5810@xmath9120 km s@xmath0 , respectively . while these values are consistent with the 3 stronger components seen in oviii lyman-@xmath7 , the high velocity absorption is much weaker in ovii .",
    "we note the strong low velocity component in ovii is probably a blend of core absorption in the broad emission line ( confirmed as self absorption in paper ii ) and absorption in the highflux continuum .",

    "the deduced velocities for these low ionisation lines are comparable to the lowest velocity component in ovii .",
    "detailed values are listed in table 2 , apart from line ( f ) , where a probable blend of oiv lines at 22.74   and 22.77   ( holczer  2009 ) makes a velocity measurement uncertain .          given the complexity of the emission and absorption in the region of the ovii triplet , it is interesting to examine the rgs data for other he - like ions .",
    "that for cv unfortunately lies beyond the range of the rgs , while the spectrum in the vicinity of the neix triplet is complicated by the presence of strong fe - l lines .",

    "the deduced velocities of -325@xmath950 km s@xmath0 and -260@xmath940 km s@xmath0 , the lowest found in the analysis so far , extend the observed link of velocity with ionisation energy .",
    "we note that any higher velocity component of nvi , corresponding to that observed near 4000 km s@xmath0 in oviii and ovii , would be blended with the absorption in cvi .",

    "those are of cvi , nvii and nex . in modelling the highflux absorption spectrum , a shallow emission line of width @xmath10=90 m  is added to the best - fit highflux continuum in each case .",

    "although the rgs suffers from decreasing sensitivity in this short wavelength region , several absorption lines are seen .",
    "line ( a ) lies just shortward of nex lyman-@xmath7 ( rest wavelength 12.13  ) , and is most probably due to a low velocity component of -620@xmath9150 km s@xmath0 . if also attributed to nex , line ( b ) corresponds to a much higher outflow component at -8230@xmath9130 km s@xmath0 , while intermediate velocity components at @xmath14000 and @xmath16000 km s@xmath0 are not detected in nex .",
    "we suggest the most likely identification of line ( c ) is with neix 1s-3p ( rest wavelength 11.55  ) , at a velocity of -5000@xmath9350 km s@xmath0 it is interesting that for nex only the highest and lowest velocity components of those seen in oviii , nvii and cvi are detected , a further indication of the trend of increasing outflow velocity with ionisation energy of the parent ion .",

    "we note , in contrast , that the low velocity absorption is seen in all resonance lines across the rgs spectrum .    in section 6",
    "we suggest that this difference , also reflected in xstar modelling , is due to a separate origin of a component of the low velocity absorption arising from self absorption in a limb - brightened shell , rather than in the direct agn continuum .",
    "table 2 brings together all the outflow velocities assigned to a significant absorption component where the parent ion can be reliably identified .",
    "also listed in table 2 is the ionisation parameter at which each ion stage would have a maximum concentration in a photoionised gas illuminated by the agn continuum flux ( kallman  1996 ) .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from the data in table 2 , which are also shown graphically in figure 8 .    first , several discrete outflow velocities are indicated , each across a range of different ions , with a clear distinction between a ` low velocity ' group ( @xmath1250 - 800 km s@xmath0 ) and a higher velocity group , with components at @xmath14000 , @xmath16000 and @xmath18500 km s@xmath0 .",
    "second , there is a strong correlation of velocity with ionisation parameter , absorption in the lower velocity components being strongest in the lower ionisation lines , and the higher velocity components being noticeably stronger for the higher ionisation lines .",
    "moreover , only the lowest velocity flow is evident in the lowest ionisation gas .    to ascertain whether the trend of increasing outflow velocity with ionisation parameter continues to still higher values , we look for evidence of absorption lines in the epic data , covering the k - shell energies of the heavier abundant elements mg , si , s. ar and fe .",
    "examination of the epic spectra reveals several absorption lines , detected in both pn and mos data , lying close to k - band resonance transitions in mg , si , s , ar and fe .",
    "figure 6 shows a section of the highflux ( revs1727 - 30 ) pn and mos spectra in the energy range from 1 - 4 kev .",
    "although the plotted ratio of data to a simple power law continuum fit are rather noisy ( with deviations near 1.8 kev and 2.3 kev that are probably due to imperfect modelling of the si k and au m edges in the instrument response function ) , a consistent set of absorption lines is seen for the 4 abundant elements with k - shell resonance transitions in this energy range .    identifying the features , observed in both pn and mos data near 1.50 , 2.05 , 2.68 and 3.42 kev , with lyman-@xmath7 absorption lines of mg , si , s and ar , respectively , and taking a weighted mean of gaussian fits to the mos and pn data , yields outflow velocities of -7100@xmath91500 km s@xmath0 , -7100@xmath92000 km s@xmath0 , -7700@xmath91600 km s@xmath0 and -9700@xmath91800 km s@xmath0 km s@xmath0",
    ". within the substantially larger uncertainties these values are consistent with the higher velocity components in the rgs data , extending their detection over a still wider range of ionisation parameter .",
    "the epic velocities are added to those from the rgs analysis in table 2 .",
    "when identified with the lyman-@xmath7 line of - from left to right - mg , si , s and ar . deviations , seen particularly in the mos data near 1.8 kev and 2.3 kev , are attributed to imperfect modelling of the si k- and gold m - absorption edges in the detector response and mirror reflectivity , title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]   when identified with the lyman-@xmath7 line of - from left to right - mg , si , s and ar . deviations , seen particularly in the mos data near 1.8 kev and 2.3 kev , are attributed to imperfect modelling of the si k- and gold m - absorption edges in the detector response and mirror reflectivity , title=\"fig:\",width=238 ]      narrow absorption lines are also seen in the fe k region of the epic spectra .",
    "correct modelling of the continuum is especially important in the neighbourhood of the fe k lines as spectral curvature below @xmath16.4 kev will have an associated fe - k absorption edge if attributed to reflection or partial covering .",

    "while most of the initial mechanical energy is lost in the shock , the total outflow momentum is maintained .    on this picture , we associate the intermediate velocity components , observed at @xmath13000 - 7500 km s@xmath0 and with the highest opacity at intermediate ionisation parameters , with the rapidly cooling shell ( or shells ) of post - shock gas , while a well - separated continuum component at @xmath1400 - 700 km s@xmath0 , in a lower ionisation state , is attributed to the gas accumulating ahead of the contact discontinuity .",
    "we speculate that a still lower velocity component may be in the ism swept up by the forward shock .",
    "compton cooling of the shocked gas by the agn radiation field is predicted to produce a soft continuum emission containing much of lost outflow kinetic energy and we propose that part of this might be observed as a residual , quasi - constant soft x - ray component ( @xmath8@xmath13.5 ) in the lowest flux spectra of .",
    "the broad line emission and strong rrc observed from several of the most abundant ions in the rgs spectrum provide additional cooling as the post - shock flow recombines .",
    "self - absorption arising in the higher line - of - sight column density around the circumference of a thin shell of post - shock gas could explain the persistence of low velocity absorption , across a wide range of ions , even when the continuum is faint .",
    "if a non - varying ovii forbidden line is a measure of the swept - up ism ahead of the forward shock , the estimated mass of @xmath17500  represents only @xmath14% of that for a virial gas density , suggesting that previous eddington episodes in  have substantially reduced the gas density in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the results reported here are based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
    "the authors wish to thank andrew king for many stimulating discussions , the anonymous referee for helpful suggestions in improving the structure of the paper , and the soc and ssc teams for organising the  observations and initial data reduction .",

    "<S> an extended  observation of the seyfert 1 galaxy  has revealed a rich absorption line spectrum indicating the presence of a photoionised outflow with a wide range of velocities and ionisation parameter . at low continuum </S>",
    "<S> fluxes an emission line spectrum is well defined with both narrow and broad emission components of several abundant metal ions . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption line velocity structure and a broad correlation of velocity with ionisation parameter are consistent with an outflow scenario where a highly ionised , high velocity wind , perhaps launched during intermittent super - eddington accretion , runs into the interstellar medium or previous ejecta , losing much of its kinetic energy in the resultant strong shock . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the possibility that a quasi - constant soft x - ray component may be evidence of this post - shock cooling . this revised view of agn outflows is consistent with multiple minor eddington accretion episodes creating a momentum - driven feedback linking black hole and host galaxy growth .    </S>",
