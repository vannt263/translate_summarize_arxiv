    "interest in the spin structure of the nucleon became prominent in the 1980 s when experiments at cern  @xcite and slac  @xcite on the integral of the proton polarized structure function @xmath22 showed that the total spin carried by quarks was very small , @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this was in contrast to the simple relativistic valence quark model prediction  @xcite in which the spin of the valence quarks carries approximately @xmath24 of the proton spin and the remaining @xmath25 comes from their orbital angular momentum . because the quark model is very successful in describing static properties of hadrons , the fact that the quark spins account for only a small part of the nucleon spin was a big surprise and generated very productive experimental and theoretical activities to the present .",
    "current understanding  @xcite of the nucleon spin is that the total spin is distributed among valence quarks , @xmath26 sea quarks , their orbital angular momenta , and gluons .",
    "this is called the nucleon spin sum rule : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the nucleon spin , @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent respectively the quark spin and orbital angular momentum ( oam ) , and @xmath31 is the total angular momentum of the gluons .",
    "only about @xmath32 of the nucleon spin is carried by the spin of the quarks . to further study the nucleon spin ,",
    "one thus needs to know more precisely how it decomposes into the three components and to measure their dependence on @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the bjorken scaling variable , which in the quark - parton model  @xcite can be interpreted as the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the quark .",
    "for a fixed target experiment one has @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the nucleon mass , @xmath35 the four momentum transfer squared and @xmath36 the energy transfer from the incident electron to the target . however , due to experimental limitations , precision data have been collected so far only in the low and moderate @xmath13 regions . in these regions ,",
    "one is sensitive to contributions from a large amount of @xmath37 sea and gluons and the nucleon is hard to model .",
    "moreover , at large distances corresponding to the size of a nucleon , the theory of the strong interaction  quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  is highly non - perturbative , which makes the investigation of the roles of quark orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and gluons in the nucleon spin structure difficult .",
    "our focus here is the first precise neutron spin structure data in the large @xmath13 region @xmath38 . for these kinematics ,",
    "the valence quarks dominate and the ratios of structure functions can be estimated based on our knowledge of the interactions between quarks . more specifically , the virtual photon asymmetry @xmath39 , defined as @xmath40 ( the definitions of @xmath41 are given in appendix  [ app : formalism ] ) , which at large @xmath35 is approximately the ratio of the polarized and the unpolarized structure functions @xmath42 , is expected to approach unity as @xmath43 in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "this is a dramatic prediction , not only because this is the only kinematic region where one can give an absolute prediction for the structure functions based on pqcd , but also because all previous data on the neutron asymmetry @xmath11 in the region @xmath38 have large uncertainties and are consistent with @xmath44 .",
    "furthermore , because both @xmath37 sea and gluon contributions are small in this region , it is a relatively clean region to test the valence quark model and to study the role of valence quarks and their oam contribution to the nucleon spin . +",
    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has served as one of the major experimental tools to study the quark and gluon structure of the nucleon .",
    "the formalism of unpolarized and polarized dis is summarized in appendix  [ app : formalism ] . within the quark parton model ( qpm )",
    ", the nucleon is viewed as a collection of non - interacting , point - like constituents , one of which carries a fraction @xmath13 of the nucleon s longitudinal momentum and absorbs the virtual photon  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon cross section is then the incoherent sum of the cross sections for elastic scattering from individual charged point - like partons .",
    "therefore the unpolarized and the polarized structure functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be related to the spin - averaged and spin - dependent quark distributions as   @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the unpolarized parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the @xmath50 quark , defined as the probability that the @xmath50 quark inside a nucleon carries a fraction @xmath13 of the nucleon s momentum , when probed with a resolution determined by @xmath35 .",
    "the polarized pdf is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the probability to find the spin of the @xmath50 quark aligned parallel ( anti - parallel ) to the nucleon spin .",
    "the polarized structure function @xmath54 does not have a simple interpretation within the qpm  .",
    "however , it can be separated into leading twist and higher twist terms using the operator expansion method  @xcite : @xmath55 here @xmath56 is the leading twist ( twist-2 ) contribution and can be calculated using the twist-2 component of @xmath57 and the wandzura - wilczek relation  @xcite as @xmath58 the higher - twist contribution to @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 .",
    "when neglecting quark mass effects , the higher - twist term represents interactions beyond the qpm , _",
    "e.g. _ , quark - gluon and quark - quark correlations  @xcite .",
    "the moment of @xmath60 can be related to the matrix element @xmath61  @xcite : @xmath62 \\nonumber\\\\        & = & 3\\int_{0}^{1 } { \\mathrm}{d}x ~x^2 \\bar g_2(x , q^2)~. \\label{equ : d2def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence @xmath61 measures the deviations of @xmath59 from @xmath63 .",
    "the value of @xmath61 can be obtained from measurements of @xmath46 and @xmath59 and can be compared with predictions from lattice qcd  @xcite , bag models  @xcite , qcd sum rules  @xcite and chiral soliton models  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we conclude the paper by summarizing the results for @xmath11 and @xmath21 and speculating on the importance of the role of quark oam on the nucleon spin in the kinematic region explored . some of the results presented here were published previously  @xcite ; the present publication gives full details on the experiment and all of the neutron spin structure results for completeness .",

    "data on @xmath11 from previous experiments did not have the precision to distinguish among different predictions , as will be shown in section  [ ch2:exp ] .      in the simplest non - relativistic constituent quark model  ( cqm )  @xcite ,",
    "the nucleon is made of three constituent quarks and the nucleon spin is fully carried by the quark spin . assuming su(6 ) symmetry , the wavefunction of a neutron polarized in the @xmath64 direction then has the form  @xcite : @xmath65 where the three subscripts are the total isospin , total spin @xmath66 and the spin projection @xmath67 along the @xmath64 direction for the ` diquark ' state . for the case of a proton one needs to exchange the @xmath68 and @xmath69 quarks in eq .",

    "i.e. _ @xmath79 . using eq .  ( [ equ : f1qpm ] ) and  ( [ equ : disf1f2 ] ) , and assuming that @xmath80 is the same for the neutron and the proton , one can write the ratio of neutron and proton @xmath81 structure functions as @xmath82 applying @xmath79 gives @xmath83 however , data on the @xmath84 ratio from slac  @xcite , cern  @xcite and fermilab  @xcite disagree with this su(6 ) prediction .",
    "the data show that @xmath85 is a straight line starting with @xmath86 and dropping to below @xmath87 as @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , @xmath88 is small at low @xmath13  @xcite . the fact that @xmath86 may be explained by the presence of a dominant amount of sea quarks in the low @xmath13 region and the fact that @xmath89 could be because these sea quarks are not highly polarized . at large  @xmath13 , however , there are few sea quarks and the deviation from su(6 ) prediction indicates a problem with the wavefunction described by eq .",
    "( [ equ : su6wvfunc ] ) .",
    "in fact , su(6 ) symmetry is known to be broken  @xcite and the details of possible su(6)-breaking mechanisms is an important open issue in hadronic physics .",
    "a possible explanation for the su(6 ) symmetry breaking is the one - gluon exchange interaction which dominates the quark - quark interaction at short - distances .",
    "this interaction was used to explain the behavior of @xmath84 near @xmath43 and the @xmath90-mev mass shift between the nucleon and the @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "later this was described by an interaction term proportional to @xmath92 , with @xmath93 the spin of the @xmath50 quark , hence is also called the hyperfine interaction , or chromomagnetic interaction among the quarks  @xcite . the effect of this perturbation on the wavefunction is to lower the energy of the @xmath71 diquark state , causing the first term of eq .",
    "( [ equ : su6wvfunc ] ) , @xmath94 , to become more stable and to dominate the high energy tail of the quark momentum distribution that is probed as @xmath43 .",
    "since the struck quark in this term has its spin parallel to that of the nucleon , the dominance of this term as @xmath43 implies @xmath95 and @xmath96 for the neutron , while for the proton one has @xmath97 one also obtains @xmath98 which could explain the deviation of @xmath85 data from the su(6 ) prediction .",
    "based on the same mechanism , one can make the following predictions : @xmath99    the hyperfine interaction is often used to break su(6 ) symmetry in the relativistic cqm ( rcqm ) . in this model ,",
    "the constituent quarks have non - zero oam which carries @xmath100 of the nucleon spin  @xcite .",
    "the use of rcqm to predict the large @xmath13 behavior of the nucleon structure functions can be justified by the valence quark dominance , _ i.e. _ , in the large  @xmath13 region almost all quantum numbers , momentum and the spin of the nucleon are carried by the three valence quarks , which can therefore be identified as constituent quarks .",
    "predictions of @xmath11 and @xmath101 in the large @xmath13 region using the hyperfine - perturbed rcqm have been achieved  @xcite .      in the early 1970 s , in one of the first applications of perturbative qcd ( pqcd )",
    ", it was noted that as @xmath43 , the scattering is from a high - energy quark and thus the process can be treated perturbatively  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when the quark oam is assumed to be zero , the conservation of angular momentum requires that a quark carrying nearly all the momentum of the nucleon ( _ i.e. _ @xmath43 ) must have the same helicity as the nucleon .",
    "this mechanism is called hadron helicity conservation ( hhc ) , and is referred to as the leading - order pqcd in this paper . in this picture ,",
    "quark - gluon interactions cause only the @xmath70 , @xmath102 diquark spin projection component rather than the full @xmath70 diquark system to be suppressed as @xmath43 , which gives @xmath103 this is one of the few places where pqcd can make an absolute prediction for the @xmath13-dependence of the structure functions or their ratios .",
    "however , how low in @xmath13 and @xmath35 this picture works is uncertain .",
    "hhc has been used as a constraint in a model to fit data on the first moment of the proton @xmath22 , giving the bbs parameterization  @xcite . the @xmath35 evolution was not included in this calculation . later in the lss(bbs ) parameterization  @xcite ,",

    "it has been suggested that effects beyond leading - order pqcd , such as quark oam  @xcite , might play an important role in processes involving quark spin flips .      in a next - to - leading order ( nlo )",
