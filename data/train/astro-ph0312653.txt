    "the large scale structures of the universe evolved from initial mass density perturbations seeded by the quantum fluctuations of inflation .",
    "the power spectrum of the initial perturbation is of power law , @xmath13 , with index @xmath14 , and so the mass density perturbation is stronger on smaller scales .",
    "accordingly , objects on smaller scales generally formed at earlier time . small objects like primordial black holes",
    "could form at the early radiation - dominated era .",
    "objects on scales of stars could form in the dark age , i.e. between the recombination and the reionization .",
    "these stars play the leading role of the history of the reionization .",
    "the study of structure formation in the cosmic dark age is challenged recently by two observations .",
    "the complete ly@xmath1 gunn - peterson trough in the absorption spectra of high redshift quasars shows that the reionization occurred probably at the redshift @xmath15 ( fan et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "the te polarization of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) yields a model - independent value of the electron scattering optical depth to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , @xmath16 , which requires the reionization redshift to be @xmath17 if the reionization happen rapidly ( kogut et al . 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , a problem naturally arisen is how to reconcile the two results , or why the reionization redshift from the ly@xmath1 spectrum is significantly lower than that given by the optical depth to the cmb .",
    "it has been realized that the high @xmath11 and low @xmath18 probably indicates that the reionization is not abrupt , but lasts a long period from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( cen 2003 ; haiman & holder 2003 ; whyithe & loeb 2003 ; holder et al .",

    "the further questions we might ask are how to describe the long period of the reionization and which is the physical mechanism leading to such a long period of the reionization ? this paper is to address these problems using a semi - analytical approach in the lognormal ( ln ) model .",
    "the ln model assumes that the mass field of intergalactic medium ( igm ) is given by an exponential mapping from the linear field ( bi 1993 ; bi & davidsen 1997 ) . the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the igm field is then lognormal .",
    "the first argument in supporting the lognormal pdf is probably from the isothermal model of the igm in the gravitational potential as @xmath21.\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the igm mass density and @xmath23 the gravitational potential . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are , respectively , the temperature and molecular weight of the gas , and @xmath26 is the polytropic index .",
    "( 1 ) is the well - known igm model of intracluster gas ( sarazin & bahcall 1977 ) .",
    "zeldovich et al .",
    "( 1990 ) pointed that when the gravity potential @xmath23 is a random field with a gaussian pdf , the field @xmath27 of eq.(1 ) is lognormal .",
    "it has been shown that the lognormal solution is a reasonable approximation of the dynamical equations of the igm ( e.g. jones 1999 ; matarrese & mohayaee 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , the ln is dynamically legitimate to model the weakly nonlinear properties ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) , and highly non - gaussian features ( feng & fang 2000 ) of the igm .",
    "recently it is also used to study the collapsing of hydrogen clouds of the igm ( bi et al .",
    "2003 , here after bffj ) .",
    "as has been emphasized in bffj , the formation of the first generation of collapsed hydrogen clouds is given by rare events , which is sensitive to the tail of the mass field pdf on the high perturbation side .",
    "it is noted that the ln pdf is of long tailed and predicts a higher probability of rare events of high perturbation than pdfs without a long tail . upon this consideration",
    ", the bffj showed that the reionization lasts a period from redshift 15 to about 10 .",
    "however , the bffj did not considered the reaction of the evolved igm on the reionization . during the reionization ,",
    "the igm underwent a dramatic evolution from neutral to ionized hydrogen , from cold to hot gas , and from low to high entropy states .",
    "consequently , the clustering behavior of the igm should also undergo a remarkable evolution in the epoch around the reionization . on the other hand ,",
    "the clustering of the underlying dark matter is not affected by the reionization .",
    "therefore , we must analyze the impact of the igm evolution upon the reionization history .",
    "the ln model directly provides the spatial distributions of the igm .",
    "it is effective to reveal the reaction of the evolution of the igm on the reionization .",
    "we will show that a long period of the recombination is a natural outcome of the ln model if considering the evolution of the igm at the reionization .",
    "a long period of the reionization history generally yield a high optical depth @xmath11 to the cmb and a low reionization redshift to the ly@xmath1 forests .",
    "we will calculate these quantities in the cold dark matter cosmological models .",
    "the paper is outlined as follow . in ",
    "2 we will describe the ln model of the reionization .",
    "the history of hydrogen reionization will be discussed in  3 . finally ",
    "4 gives the discussion and conclusion .",
    "in the ln model , the mass field of the igm is given by an exponential mapping of the linear density field of the underlying dark matter as @xmath28,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the variance of the linear gaussian field of the dark matter filtered on scales of the jeans length @xmath30 of the igm ; @xmath31 is the linear density contrast of dark matter @xmath32 smoothed by a window on the jeans scale , i.e. its fourier counterpart is ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is @xmath35 of the comoving jeans length of the igm .",
    "obviously , when the fluctuation @xmath31 is small , i.e. @xmath36 , eq.(2 ) reduces to approximately @xmath37 , where @xmath38/\\bar{\\rho}$ ] is the density contrast of the igm .",
    "moreover , when the fluctuation @xmath31 is large , combining eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) yields eq.(1 ) ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) . since the initial density perturbation is stronger on smaller scales , the perturbations of the dark matter gravitational potential @xmath39 are larger on smaller scales .",
    "thus , even at early universe the igm field on small scales may already be in the state described by eq.(1 ) .",
    "thus , it would be not appropriate to assume that the igm field is always gaussian on all scales .",
    "the ln model provides a uniform description of the igm distribution in the linear , weakly nonlinear and lognormal regime at various scales and redshifts .",
    "since the random field @xmath40 is gaussian , the pdf of the field @xmath22 is lognormal as @xmath41 , \\hspace{3 mm } \\rho \\geq 0.\\ ] ] which gives the probability density of the event such that the mass density within an area on scales of the jeans length is found to be equal to @xmath42 .",
    "the tail of the pdf eq.(4 ) is @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "therefore , the probability of @xmath44 for a given @xmath29 would be equal to the probability of @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "namely , the change of variance @xmath29 by a factor 2 leads to a change of the possible high density events from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .",
    "obviously , the pdf is normalized as @xmath47 , and the variance of @xmath44 is given by ( vanmarcke 1983 ) @xmath48^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the @xmath49 moment of @xmath50 is @xmath51.\\ ] ] equation ( 6 ) shows @xmath52^{1/n } > [ \\overline { ( \\rho/\\bar{\\rho})^2}]^{1/2}$ ] . that is , the ratio between the high- and low - order moments is divergent in the limit of @xmath53 .",
    "a field with such a divergent moment ration , by definition , is intermittent ( zeldovich , ruzmaikin , & sokoloff 1990 ) .",
    "actually , ln is typically a mathematical model of intermittent field .",
    "this property is in good consistent with the detected intermittency of the transmitted flux of qso ly@xmath1 absorption ( jamkhedkar , zhan & fang 2000 ; feng , pando & fang 2003 , jamkhedkar et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "equation ( 2 ) shows that , in the ln model , the clustering features of the baryonic gas is characterized by the variance @xmath29 of the linear density field on the scale of the jeans length .",
    "primordial baryons , created at the time of nucleosynthesis , recombines with electrons to become neutral gas at @xmath54 .",
    "thereafter , the gas cools down adiabatically with the expansion of the universe . in a homogeneous universe with the mean mass density @xmath55 , the jean length of gaseous baryonic matter or the igm",
    "is defined by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the sound speed of gas .",
    "the corresponding jeans mass is @xmath58 . in a comoving scale of @xmath59",
    ", we have ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) @xmath60^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the polytropic index is assumed to be @xmath61 , and hydrogen temperature thus follows @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the mean mass density of baryonic matter . at @xmath64 ,",
    "the hydrogen temperature is @xmath65 k ( medvigy & loeb 2001 ) , and the jeans length @xmath66 kpc . the redshift evolution of the comoving jeans length @xmath34 is approximately given by @xmath67 .    during the reionization , the baryonic gas will be heated by the uv ionizing background from few degrees of temperature to @xmath68 ; and correspondingly , there is about 2 magnitudes increasing in @xmath34 or 6 magnitudes in the jeans mass ( e.g. ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) .",
    "after the reionization , the igm temperature is maintained at about @xmath69 by the uv background photons , and therefore , @xmath34 will gradually increase with the decrease of @xmath70 due to the factor @xmath71 in eq.(7 ) .    for the variance @xmath29 in eq.(2 ) , we consider three fiducial cosmological models .",
    "two are inferred from the wmap , and one from the cobe .",
    "the cosmological parameters of these models are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use the linear power spectrum of the dark matter given by eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) .",
    "the linear variance is approximately growing with redshift as @xmath72 .",
    "for cosmological models of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the linear growth of density perturbations is not exactly following the factor @xmath75 ( lahav et al .",
    "we take account of this effect by replacing the factor @xmath75 by @xmath76 , where the @xmath77 factor is @xmath78 this correction is approximately reasonable at @xmath79 ( avelino & de carvalho 1999 , carroll et at .",
    "for the models of wmap1 , wmap2 and cobe , the @xmath77 factor is also shown in table 1 .",
    "because the powers of the linear perturbations @xmath80 in all of these models are smaller on larger scales , the two order magnitude jump of @xmath34 at the reionization generally leads to a drop - off of the variance @xmath29 .",
    "a typical curve of @xmath29 for the model wmap2 is displayed in fig . 1",
    ", in which the reionization is assumed to happen instantly around redshift @xmath81 . the dotted line in fig .",
    "1 is for @xmath29 in case of no reionization occurring .",
    "the zigzag @xmath70-dependence around the reionization is a common feature of the @xmath29 curve .",
    "for instance , the fig .",
    "2 of the bffj shows also a zigzag at @xmath82 . in the bffj",
    ", it is _ assumed _ that the reionization takes place at redshift @xmath83 . in this paper , we will not use _ a priori _ zigzag redshift @xmath18 , but determine it by a self - consistent calculation .",
    "it should be pointed out that the zigzag @xmath70-dependence of @xmath29 does not affect the evolution of dark matter , of which the clustering is basically regardless the reionization .",

    "thus , fig .",
    "2 can be only used at redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath109 with @xmath44 is much slower than a gaussian pdf , or pdfs with a gauss - like tail . for a gaussian tail",
    ", we have @xmath110 $ ] , or @xmath111 , when @xmath112 . however , fig .",
    "2 shows that even when @xmath70 is as high as 20 , @xmath113 is less than @xmath114 only by a factor less than 10 .",
    "this is obviously due to the long tail behavior of the lognormal pdf , which gives a larger probability of high density events at high redshifts when the variance @xmath29 is still small .",
    "the variable @xmath44 in eq.(9 ) is the density within an area on scales of the jeans length , and therefore , the area with @xmath115 has mass larger than the jeans mass .",
    "however , these regions are not always in collapsing .",
    "this is because that the igm clouds have no time to collapse even when the cloud mass is larger than the jeans mass .",
    "bffj found that at redshift @xmath116 , only clouds with density @xmath117 are in the turning phase .",
    "the threshold @xmath118 is much larger than the jeans mass . in other words ,",
    "the clustering on the jeans length scales is significantly suppressed .",
    "the suppression of collapsing on the jeans length scales has also been noted in studying the so - called filtering scale ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) .",
    "the threshold for the clouds going to collapsing at redshift @xmath119 is a little lower than 6 .",
    "therefore , the mass fraction of collapsed clouds can be estimated by the cumulative mass fraction @xmath114 .",
    "one can estimated the velocity dispersion of the collapsed clouds by considering that in the ln model the collapsed clouds in potential well is probably isothermal [ eq.(1 ) ] .",
    "in this case , the velocity dispersion of the collapsed clouds is approximately ( e.g. jing & fang 1994 ) @xmath120 thus , for @xmath121 , @xmath122 , the velocity dispersion of the collapsed clouds of @xmath123 is from @xmath124 3.8 km s@xmath125 at @xmath126 to @xmath124 7.7 km s@xmath125 at @xmath127 . if using @xmath128 , we have @xmath129 5.0 km s@xmath125 at @xmath126 to @xmath124 9.8 km s@xmath125 at @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , all these clouds have mass larger than @xmath130 m@xmath131 , the @xmath132 cooling can take place .",
    "the so - called clumping factor is the second moment of the igm density field defined by @xmath133 fig .",
    "3 plots the clumping factor @xmath134 in the three models with @xmath29 without considering the drop - off at @xmath18 .",
    "it can only be used for redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the clumping factor is significantly @xmath70-dependent .",
    "for all three models , @xmath134 are large only at redshift @xmath135 , and rapidly decreases to @xmath136 at redshifts @xmath137 . at a first glance , it seems to be a contradict between a higher probability of clustering and a lower clumping factor .",
    "actually , it is nothing but a typical feature of intermitted field , which consists of high density spikes and low density regions between the spikes , and therefore , dense objects can be effectively formed in the spikes , while the mean clumping factor over the whole space is relatively low .",
    "from fig . 1 , one can see that the @xmath70-dependence of @xmath29 before and after the reionization @xmath18 are similar . before @xmath18 , @xmath29",
    "is increased from 0.4 to 0.8 , and after @xmath18 , @xmath29 is again to increase from about 0.4 to higher values .",
    "a fall of @xmath29 is by a factor of @xmath138 2 at @xmath18 . of course",
    ", the change of @xmath29 at the drop is dependent on @xmath18 . in this section ,",
    "we only qualitatively describe the effect of the @xmath29 drop on the clustering of baryonic gas .",
    "quantitative calculation will be given in next two subsections .",
    "as emphasized in  2.1 , the cumulative mass fraction is a strong function of @xmath29 .",
    "the drop of @xmath29 by a factor of two leads to a substantial change of the cumulative mass fraction .",
    "one can then divide the igm clustering into two phases , before and after redshift @xmath18 . before the reionization ,",
    "structure formation was weak when the variance @xmath139 , and became more active when the variance reached @xmath140 . just after @xmath29 dropping , the structure formation tended to inactive again as the variance reduced to @xmath139 . soon after the variance growing up to @xmath140 , the structure formation was built up once more",
    ". therefore , there are two phases , in which the rate of structure formations are high .",
    "the early phase is just before @xmath18 , and the late phase is at the second time of @xmath141 .",
    "the physical reason for the two - phase scenario of structure formation is obvious .",
    "baryonic gas falls into dark matter gravity wells and the first generation of stars forms before @xmath18 . because the uv ionization photons background is gradually established from the first generation stars , baryonic gas is heated to temperature @xmath142 , and the jeans length becomes bigger .",
    "the irregularities or clustering within the big jeans scale would be smeared out by thermal motion . since the density fluctuations on the big jeans scales would still be in the linear regime , the process of the structure formation is significantly suppressed even halted . at the end of this smearing out , some ionized hydrogen will move away from the bottom of the gravity wells of dark matter halos .",
    "eq.(1 ) also shows that when the temperature @xmath24 increases by a factor of 10@xmath143 , many nonlinear structures will disappear .",
    "the clustering will recover till the variance @xmath29 growing again . in the second phase , the objects form from ionized igm , and their masses range in the order of @xmath144 @xmath145 .",
    "in the two - phase scenario , the structure formation will be slowed down just after the reionization .",
    "consequently , there is no enough uv photons produced by stars to maintain a fully ionized igm , and a significant fraction of hi remains in the igm . in this case , the igm is opaque for ly@xmath1 photons .",
    "the igm becomes transparent for ly@xmath1 photons till the redshift at which the rate of star formation grows again to be able to produce enough uv photons for maintaining a highly ionized igm .",
    "therefore , we can define two redshifts : ( 1 ) @xmath18 , the redshift of reionization , which is the first time when the igm was fully ( or almost fully ) ionized and heated up to temperature @xmath146 k ; ( 2 ) @xmath9 , the redshift of the gunn - peterson transparency , which is the starting time for igm entering into the state such that the volume - averaged fraction of hi is less than 10@xmath147 , and the gunn - peterson absorption ceased . in a word , the clustering of the igm is suppressed during the period from @xmath18 to @xmath9 , and thus leads to the reionization epoch lasting a long period from @xmath18 to @xmath9 .    the two - phase scenario is based on the @xmath70-@xmath29 relation indicated in fig .",
    "1 . obviously",
    ", this @xmath70-dependence of @xmath29 is approximate , as we assumed that the temperature of the igm suddenly increased by a factor of 10@xmath143 .",
    "more precisely , the sharp decline of @xmath29 at @xmath18 should be replaced by a soften transition from the top branch to the bottom branch in the @xmath148 plane .",
    "nevertheless , the mechanism for a long period reionization outlined above still works , as it essentially depends only on the decrease of @xmath29 with the heating and ionizing igm .",
    "let us first calculate the reionization redshifts @xmath18 .",
    "the reionization of hydrogen clouds is usually characterized by the filling factor of ionized hydrogen @xmath149 .",
    "the reionization redshift @xmath18 can approximately determined by requiring @xmath150 .",
    "the equation of @xmath149 is given by ( e.g. barkana & loeb 2001 ) @xmath151 where the factor @xmath152 is from the fraction of hydrogen in the cosmic baryons , @xmath153h@xmath154/0.022 ) @xmath155 is the present value of the mean number density of hydrogen , @xmath156 is the mean ionization photons produced by each baryon in collapsed objects and might be @xmath157-dependent . the first term on the r.h.s . of eq.(12 ) accounts for the ionizing source",
    "the ionization photons produced by primordial black holes are negligible because of the spectral index @xmath158 on small scales ( he & fang , 2002 ) .",
    "the second term on the r.h.s . of eq.(12 ) is from the recombination , in which @xmath159 is the cosmic factor , @xmath160 is the case b recombination coefficient @xmath161 for hydrogen at @xmath162 k , and @xmath163 is the clumping factor of @xmath164 .",
    "solving eq.(12 ) yields @xmath165 where @xmath166 in the solution ( 13 ) , an uncertain parameter is @xmath12 , which depends on the atomic processes in star formation . as usual , one can express this number by @xmath167 , where @xmath168 - the fraction of collapsed baryon that formed star ; @xmath169 - the ionization photon number produced per baryon in star ; and @xmath170 - the fraction of photon that escaped from galaxy .",
    "generally , the first generation stars are massive ( abel et al . 2002 , bromm et al . 2002 ) , and their lifetime are much less than the hubble time at high z that we are interested .",
    "thus , it would be reasonable to approximate the photons @xmath169 being produced at the same redshift as collapsed clouds .",

    "a common feature is that the reionization @xmath176 drops to a level less than 1 after @xmath18 , and then keeps @xmath196 in the epoch of redshift @xmath197 .",
    "it is due to the decrease of the star formation rate when @xmath29 drops back to @xmath139 .",
    "when @xmath198 , @xmath29 becomes higher again [ fig . 1 ] , and therefore , @xmath176 quickly approaches to 1 .",
    "each curves of fig . 6",
    "show that there are two solutions to the equation @xmath199 , the first is at @xmath200 , and the second is at @xmath201 .",
    "this corresponds to the two phases of the star formation . during the period between the redshift @xmath18 and @xmath9 ,",
    "the igm is in multi - phase .",
    "the igm consists of neutral and ionized hydrogen , hi and hii .",
    "both components are comparable , and opaque for ly@xmath1 photons . however , the temperature of such multiphase igm can be of the order of 10@xmath143 k in average .",
    "therefore , it is self - consistent to apply the bottom branch of the @xmath29 of fig . 1 .    when @xmath198 , the filling factor of neutral hydrogen becomes small quickly .",
    "the igm is then transparent for ly@xmath1 photons when the volume filling factor of hi is less than 10@xmath147 , and thus the redshift @xmath9 corresponds to the onset of the gunn - peterson transparency .",
    "it should be pointed out that the two peak curve of @xmath176 actually depends on the sharply dropping of @xmath29 at @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . as has been discussed in  3.1",
    ", more realistic model should replace the sudden increase of igm temperature by a soft process . in this case",
    ", @xmath176 probably never reached 1 at @xmath18 , but at most shows a peak around @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , before @xmath9 , the igm has never been ionized to the level of @xmath202 . thus",
    ", the redshift @xmath9 is the first time of the igm becoming the gunn - peterson transparency .",
    "table 3 gives @xmath9 for three sets of parameters .",
    "figure 6 and table 3 shows that the redshift interval @xmath203 is always as large as @xmath204 , which is not sensitive to the adopted parameters .",
    "this is because long duration from @xmath18 to @xmath9 is essentially due to the zigzag @xmath70-dependence of the @xmath29 , which is less - sensitive to cosmological parameters , and the details of start formation .",
    "the temperature of the igm increases by a factor of about 10@xmath143 during the reionization , while the entropy parameter @xmath205 also increases by few orders . since high temperature and high entropy prevent baryonic gas from collapsing into the gravity well of dark matter , the reionization is slowed down with the increase of temperature and entropy of the igm .",
    "it behaves like a negative feedback mechanism : once the rate of star formation is higher , the uv background produced by the star formation is also higher , and then more baryonic gas will be heated to higher temperature and higher entropy state .",
    "this finally yields a suppression on the rate of star formation .",
    "therefore , the long duration of reionization is mainly given by the evolution of the temperature and entropy of the baryonic gas during the reionization .",
    "if the reionization lasts the long period of @xmath18-@xmath9 , the number density of free electrons is significant through the whole epoch @xmath206 .",
    "one can then expect that in this reionization history the electron scattering optical depth to the cmb would be much larger than models with @xmath207 . with the solution of @xmath176 , the electron scattering optical depth to the cmb",
    "can be calculated by ( e.g. hui et al . 2003 ) @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the volume filling factor of @xmath164 .",
    "eq.(16 ) considered only the electrons from ionized hydrogen . to consider the contribution of he ,",
    "we had assumed the filling factor of heii to be identical to @xmath164 , i.e. the optical depth is increased by a factor of 1.08 .",
    "the heii @xmath210 @xmath211 ionization occurred at redshift @xmath212 ( theuns et al .",
    "2002 ) , and therefore , the correction of heiii on @xmath11 is no more than 0.001 .",
    "the relation between the volume filling factor @xmath213 and @xmath176 is dependent on the statistical behavior of the formation of the ionized region .",
    "if the ionized hydrogen region increase , @xmath214 in the duration @xmath157 to @xmath215 is without spatial memory , the formation probability would be uniform in space regardless whether there are ionized region formed at time before @xmath157 .",
    "thus , we have equation @xmath216 , and the solution is @xmath217 $ ] . however , the formation of the ionized region probably is not without spatial memory .",
    "the probability of forming collapsed clouds at the position where already hosted collapsed clouds should be low .",
    "therefore , the process of the ionized hydrogen region formation most likely is self - avoid , i.e. the process has less probability at the positions where the process has been visited(e.g .",
    "cardy 1996 ) . for a perfectly self - avoiding process",
    ", no position can host the formation process more than once ( e.g. cardy 1996 ) . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath218 till @xmath219 .",
    "table 3 lists the results of @xmath18 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 for the model wmap2 with parameters @xmath220 specified by ( 6 , 40 ) , ( 8 , 40 ) and ( 6 , 80 ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath221 is for the model without any self - avoiding , while @xmath222 is for model with perfectly self - avoiding .",
    "real number probably is in between of these two ultimate models .",
    "all results shown in table 3 give a low @xmath9 @xmath223 and a high @xmath11 @xmath224 .",
    "these results are excellently consistent with the observations of the redshift of the gunn - peterson trough and the electron optical depth to the cmb .",
    "the key of reconciling the two observation is that there exists a long period of the universe to have @xmath225 .",
    "the free electrons in this period contribute to a high value of @xmath11 . on the other hand , the gunn - peterson transparency occurred at the end of this epoch , and the redshift @xmath9 is small .",

    "we showed with the ln model that the reionization and gunn - peterson transparency emerged at very different time .",

    "hot dark age @xmath2 , in which a substantial part of baryon gas is ionized and hot , but it is still opaque for ly@xmath1 photons , 3 . ) bright age @xmath3 .",

    "that is , the hot dark age is in the redshift interval from 13 - 19 to 6 -8 .",
    "this thermal history naturally yields a high optical depth @xmath229 and a low @xmath230 , which is in excellent agreement with the observations of @xmath11 ( wmap ) and @xmath9 ( gunn - peterson trough ) .",
    "the long duration from @xmath18 to @xmath9 is essentially due to the evolution of the temperature and entropy of the baryonic gas during the reionization .",
    "for all the considered cosmological models , there is always a drop - off of @xmath29 at @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , a large difference @xmath231 is a common property of these models .",
    "the result of low @xmath9 and high @xmath11 is less sensitive to the cosmological parameters .",
    "this result is also weakly dependent on the details of production of ionization photons from stars .",
    "this is due to the feedback mechanism of the start formation (  3.3 ) .",
    "the higher rate of ionization photon production will cause a stronger input of entropy to baryonic gas .",
    "it then leads to a lower rate of the collapsing of baryonic clouds , suppressing the rate of star formation and the uv photon production .",
    "therefore , model , which properly considers the dramatic evolution of the temperature and entropy of the igm , will generally yield a low @xmath9 and a high @xmath11 .",
    "the ln model provides an intuitive and quantitative description of the effect of the igm temperature evolution upon the reionization history .",
    "this is because the ln model use directly variance @xmath29 as a key parameter .",
    "it has already been recognized that the variance @xmath29 is more effective and successful in modeling the igm detected by qso s ly@xmath1 forests ( bi & davidsen 1997 ) .",
    "we showed in this paper that the ln model provides a plausible description of photoionized and neutral igm not only in the redshift range @xmath232 , but extended to @xmath233 .",
    "the hot dark age between the redshifts @xmath18 and @xmath9 is an interesting issue . during that period ,",
    "star formation is significant , although the rate of star formation is lower than that at @xmath18 . on the other hand ,",
    "baryonic gas is in multiphase , and consists of comparable components of hi and hii .",
    "the gas has been already hot .",
    "therefore , it is expected to find some observable signatures , such as high redshift 21 cm emission , of the hot dark age ."
