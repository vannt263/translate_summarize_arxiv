    "this represents the particular wavepacket of waveguide modes that takes part in the determination of the prepared cavity field . on the other hand , the vacuum noise provided by the modes @xmath117",

    "we thus find that also the problem of feeding the cavity can be mapped to a beam - splitter evolution , characterized by the same figure of merit that we found in the main text for the complementary task of cavity field extraction .",
    "it is easy to see that the same results apply to the models describing the two - cavity implementations presented in the main text : namely the same figures of merit @xmath132 are found when considering the cavity feeding problem .",
    "as a concrete example , we shall consider the case in which the cavity mode @xmath42 is initially prepared in a squeezed state @xcite .",

    "we find @xmath176 once again , a cooperativity parameter directly affects the figure of merit of our protocol . in this case",
    ", the additional decay rate @xmath177 introduced by the atoms combines additively with the bare decay rate @xmath5 of the main cavity .",
    "here , we show that even a two level system may be in principle capable of extracting a cavity field with high fidelity , in spite of its low dimensionality . indeed , assume that the bosonic scatterer @xmath0 of the main text is substituted by a two level atom , such that the hamiltonian becomes @xmath178 .",
    "as before , we assume that the atom decays at rate @xmath2 in the waveguide , and @xmath4 into external modes .",
    "the heisenberg equations of the system in this case read @xcite @xmath179 now , let us assume that all relevant cavity states satisfy @xmath180 , with @xmath181 fixed .",
    "if one works in the fast emission regime @xmath182 , it is expected that the atom stays close to its ground state throughout the dynamics , and it can thus be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "hence , we can substitute @xmath183 in eq .  , which in turn allows to express @xmath184 as a function of @xmath185 . subsituting this in eq .",

    "it is then straightforward to prove that the usual beam - splitter mapping @xmath189 can be retrieved , now characterized by a figure of merit @xmath190 that is given by the ratio between waveguide emission and total emission : @xmath191 this indeed coincides with the result obtained for the bosonic scatterer in the main text , if the limit @xmath192 is taken in eq .  .",
    "for simplicity , let us describe here the case of @xmath193 atom , the extension to @xmath194 atoms being straightforward . together with the ground state @xmath195 , we now consider two degenerate excited states @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "we assume that the transition @xmath198 is coupled to the cavity field @xmath6 only , while @xmath199 is coupled to @xmath59 .",
    "in the two - cavity setup we have proposed , this selectivity may be due to a different spatial orientation of the atomic emission pattern of the two transitions , such that each transition is spatially matched to only one of the two cavity fields .",
    "if instead @xmath6 and @xmath59 belong to the same cavity , the selectivity may be due to the different polarization of the two modes .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between atoms and fields reads @xmath200 where @xmath201 and @xmath202 are the coupling strengths . to realize standard cavity qed within the high - q cavity @xmath6",
    ", we have to suppress the hamiltonian term proportional to @xmath202 .",

    "<S> @xcite ) . at variance with the previous case no bosonization of the atoms </S>",
    "<S> is required , hence the scheme may be applicable also when the number of atoms @xmath63 is small . </S>",
    "<S> we consider eq .   with @xmath97 , and add a detuning @xmath98 to all atoms , resulting in a hamiltonian @xmath99 . in the large detuning limit @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> one can adiabatically eliminate the atomic excited states and derive an effective hamiltonian for the ground state subspace @xcite : @xmath101.$ ] identifying @xmath102 , this provides the desired interaction hamiltonian , with @xmath103 ( plus a global frequency shift which can be ignored ) . </S>",

    "<S>  a natural question to ask is whether the standard protocols of cavity qed are still applicable in our two - mode scheme . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it would be convenient if the same atoms employed for the q - factor control could be used for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> in @xcite we show that this is indeed possible , by addressing two internal transitions of the atoms such that each mode is coupled to a different transition . by applying appropriate stark shifts to the atoms , </S>",

    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook _ </S>",
    "<S>  we have proposed a general scheme in which a mediator allows to switch coherently from a ` closed ' to an ` open ' cavity , so that the advantages of both regimes may be combined in a single setup . after having identified the accessible output mode that best represents the initially prepared cavity field , we have fully characterized the effective ` transmittivity ' parameter which encodes the quality of the process . as clarified in @xcite , the same figure of merit </S>",
    "<S> is obtained for the complementary process of ` feeding ' an initially empty cavity . </S>",
    "<S> let us also emphasise that our scheme is applicable to a single qubit mediator whose excited level is only virtually populated , which allows for an effective bosonic description @xcite . by considering a cavity - qed implementation </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that state of the art experimental parameters should be compatible with a demonstration of our scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> our work may represent a contribution towards the achievement of ambitious goals such as the direct access to nonclassical cavity field states , the realization of cavity - based quantum memories and continuous - variable quantum networks . </S>",
    "<S> goals worth pursuing include the introduction of time dependent controls to achieve time - reversal symmetry in the emitted fields , crucial for the realization of quantum networks @xcite .    _ acknowledgments _  we thank g. m. palma , f. ciccarello , d. segal , m .- j . </S>",
