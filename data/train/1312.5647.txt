    "introduced by topologists @xcite , @xmath0-betti numbers have been generalized to various contexts like groups , groupoids etc .",
    "alain connes and dimitri shlyakhtenko @xcite introduced @xmath0-betti numbers for subalgebras of finite von neumann algebras , with the purpose to obtain a suitable notion for arbitrary ii@xmath1-factors and in the hope to get a nice homological invariant for them . unfortunately , as of now there are only very few concrete calculations of them .",
    "the most advanced computational result so far is due to andreas thom @xcite who proved that the @xmath0-betti numbers vanish for von neumann algebras with diffuse center .",
    "to allow more computable examples , he also introduced a continuous version of the first @xmath0-betti number @xcite which turns out to be much more manageable than its algebraic counterpart .",
    "the first continuous @xmath0-betti number is defined as the von neumann dimension of the first continuous hochschild cohomology of the von neumann algebra @xmath2 with values in the algebra of operators affiliated with @xmath3 .",
    "the word ` continuous ' here means that we restrict attention to derivations which are continuous from the norm topology on @xmath2 to the measure topology on the affiliated operators .",
    "so far only vanishing results were obtained about the first continuous @xmath0-betti number : it has been shown to vanish for ii@xmath1-factors with cartan subalgebras , non - prime ii@xmath1-factors @xcite as well as for ii@xmath1-factors with property ( t ) , property @xmath4 and finitely generated ii@xmath1 factors with nontrivial fundamental group @xcite .",
    "the last result is due to a compression formula for the first continuous @xmath0-betti number ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.10 ) .    the hope placed upon @xmath0-betti numbers for group von neumann algebras was to be able to connect them with @xmath0-betti numbers of groups , thus obtaining a powerful invariant which would be able to distinguish free group factors , thus solving a long - standing problem in operator algebras .",
    "in fact , the attempt to do this can be formulated in a very concrete way using generators of the @xmath0-cohomology of the group ring @xmath5 of the free group or some other subalgebras of @xmath6 generated by free elements .",
    "one possible choice of generators is to consider the so - called voiculescu s free difference quotients @xcite .",
    "andreas thom posed a natural question in @xcite , whether these derivations possess continuous extensions to operators from @xmath6 to @xmath7 ; a positive answer to this question would solve the free factor isomorphism problem .    in the present paper",
    "we answer this question in the negative ; in fact , we show that the first continuous @xmath0-cohomology of free group factors vanishes ; in particular , they can not be distinguished by this invariant .",
    "this also suggests that the invariant might be altogether trivial , i.e. that the first continuous @xmath0-cohomology might in fact vanish for all ii@xmath1-factors .",
    "the result is established in several steps .",
    "first , we focus on the free group with three generators @xmath8 and show that the canonical derivations which `` derive in direction of a free generator '' can not be extended to the group von neumann algebra .",
    "this is shown by analyzing their values on some specific elements for which the spectrum of the resulting operators can be calculated using free probability theory . to derive the vanishing of the whole continuous cohomology",
    ", we have to use certain automorphisms of the free group factors .",
    "hereby we make use of certain weak mixing properties relative to a subalgebra ; intuitively speaking , we are using the fact that there are enough automorphisms to move our derivations around ; thus , the existence of one continuous non - inner derivation would automatically guarantee that all derivations of @xmath9 are extendable , which yields a contradiction .",
    "finally , we make use of the compression formula to extend the result from a single free group factor to all of them .    the author thanks thomas schick and andreas thom for helpful discussions and useful suggestions .",
    "in this section we set up the notation and briefly recapitulate the theory of non - commutative integration and the theory of @xmath0-betti numbers for von neumann algebras .",
    "we consider finite von neumann algebras @xmath2 , @xmath10 etc . with separable preduals .",
    "we always endow them with a fixed faithful normal tracial state ( usually denoted by @xmath11 ) and consider them in the corresponding gns representation @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 is a finite von neumann algebra , then there is an induced a faithful normal tracial state on the von neumann algebraic tensor product @xmath14 of @xmath10 with its opposite algebra ; abusing notation slightly , we will still denote it by @xmath11 .",
    "we let @xmath15 be the algebra of closed densely defined operators on @xmath12 affiliated with @xmath10 .",
    "we equip @xmath15 with the _ measure topology _ , defined by the following two - parameter family of zero neighbourhoods : n ( , ) = \\{au(n)| p(n ) : < , ( p^ ) < } , , > 0 . with this topology , @xmath15 is a complete ( * ? ? ?",
