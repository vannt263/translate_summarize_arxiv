    "the standard model ( sm ) has been very successful to describe the experimental data from accelerator physics so far . with new colliders , like the large hadron collider ( lhc ) or later on the international linear collider ( ilc ) , becoming operational , the hope is to detect signals which could reveal physics beyond the sm , that in turn provide answers to the many theoretical questions left unanswered by the sm .",
    "+   + one of the most motivated scenarios for new physics is generally considered to be supersymmetry ( susy ) . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    ", the large number of free parameters makes the phenomenological studies rather complicated .",
    "many studies are therefore based on the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  often called msugra  with the number of parameters reduced to five , corresponding to @xmath3 ( common mass of scalar particles at the supersymmetric grand unification scale ) , @xmath4 ( universal gaugino mass ) , @xmath5 ( universal trilinear susy breaking parameter ) , together with the sign of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath6 and the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath1 .",
    "+   + many studies have been performed to constrain the supersymmetric parameter space , and in particular direct and indirect searches for new particles have provided lower bounds on their masses @xcite .",
    "other constraints come from the cosmological observations of the large scale structures and the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , and the study of radiative b meson decays .",
    "+   + the precision measurements of the radiative b meson decays , which have become possible with the operation of the b factories and other b - dedicated experiments , have provided exciting opportunities for mapping possible routes beyond the sm .",
    "one such rare decay mode is the exclusive process @xmath0 and its associated inclusive transition @xmath8 , which have been extensively used to constrain new physics @xcite .",
    "consequently , a thorough investigation of the branching ratio of these decay modes has been instrumental in constraining the parameter space of various models . in this paper , we focus on another observable , the isospin asymmetry , and we will show that this observable may even lead to more stringent constraints than the branching ratios . +   + the isospin asymmetry for the exclusive process @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath9 with @xmath10 obtained from eq.([isospinasym ] ) by using the charge conjugate modes .",
    "the most recent data for exclusive decays from belle @xcite and babar @xcite point to isospin asymmetries of at most a few percent , consistent with zero within the experimental errors : @xmath11 where the last error in eq.([babar ] ) is due to the uncertainty in the ratio of the branching fractions of the neutral and charged b",
    "meson production in @xmath12 decays . within the sm ,",
    "this asymmetry , which is due to the non - spectator contributions , has been estimated in the literature , using the qcd factorization approach in refs . @xcite and @xcite , brodsky - lepage formalism @xcite , and the perturbative qcd method @xcite .",

    ". +   + in the following , we first present the general framework of our investigation , followed by an analysis of the constraints of the isospin asymmetry on the msugra parameter space in the context of minimal flavor violation . in order to compare the constraints due to isospin breaking with those obtained from the branching ratios ,",
