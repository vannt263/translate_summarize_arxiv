    "the multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm from signal processing has in the past years been successfully utilized as a non - iterative reconstruction method for detecting small point - like scattering obstacles or inhomogeneities from so - called multi - static scattering data ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and it is well known that music - type reconstruction methods have strong connections to other qualitative reconstruction schemes such as , e.g. , the linear sampling method  @xcite or the factorization method  @xcite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the basic assumption of this class of algorithms is that observations of scattered fields generated by sufficiently many different incident fields at a fixed frequency ( i.e. , multi - static scattering data ) are available .    in this work",
    "we consider a different data set .",
    "we assume that far field patterns of scattered fields corresponding to plane wave incident fields with just one fixed incident direction but several different frequencies are given .",
    "we design and analyze a _ multifrequency music _ algorithm for determining the number and the positions of finite collections of small scattering objects from these data .",
    "we will also show how to adapt this reconstruction scheme to work with multifrequency backscattering data sets .",
    "our discussion of the multifrequency music algorithm is based on an asymptotic representation formula for the far field pattern of the scattered field as the size of the scatterers tends to zero with respect to the wave length of the incident field .",
    "such expansions have been widely studied in the literature ( cf .",
    "however , since we apply the result to justify a multifrequency reconstruction scheme , we put particular emphasis on frequency dependence and give a short concise proof showing that the asymptotic formula holds uniformly across whole frequency bands .",
    "moreover , we include the possibility that the scatterers are absorbing , which is modeled by a frequency dependent imaginary part in the index of refraction .",
    "making use of the fact that the leading order term in the asymptotic expansion of the far field pattern resembles a so - called _ multivariate extended exponential sum _ , the inverse scattering problem essentially reduces to a parameter estimation problem .",
    "related problems have recently been considered in @xcite where different multivariate generalizations of prony - type methods have been proposed , in @xcite where music - type methods for single - snapshot spectral estimation have been considered , and in @xcite where a rather different approach relying on total variation minimization has been discussed .",
    "the multifrequency music algorithm considered in this work generalizes the one - dimensional scheme considered in @xcite and is also related to multi - variate prony - type methods .",
    "when compared to the methods in @xcite our scheme has two advantages : ( i ) it does not require to compute common zeros of sets of multivariate polynomials , and ( ii ) we do not have to assume that the coefficients in the multivariate exponential sum have equal sign to avoid cancellation effects .",
    "indeed , we give sufficient conditions on the number of frequencies and observation directions that are needed to guarantee that the reconstruction algorithm recovers all scattering objects  at least theoretically  which generalizes related results on parameter estimation for bivariate exponential sums in @xcite .    recently a multifrequency music algorithm has been considered for the ( quasi - stationary ) inverse boundary value problem of electrical impedance tomography in @xcite , but the approach used in these works differs considerably from the method discussed here .",
    "furthermore , a multifrequency linear sampling method has been proposed in @xcite , but in contrast to our work this method requires a much larger data set , namely observations of scattered fields generated by plane wave incident fields with sufficiently many different incident directions at several different frequencies . on the other hand , a prony - type reconstruction method for a much smaller data set that requires a single far field pattern corresponding to a plane wave incident field at a single frequency only has been considered in  @xcite . since this method uses the evanescent modes of the far field pattern only , it suffers from a certain lack of stability .",
    "finally , backpropagation algorithms for multifrequency scattering data have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we specify the problem setting and establish the asymptotic representation formula for the far field pattern due to an ensemble of finitely many small scattering objects . the multifrequency music algorithm for determining the number and the positions of the scatterers",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : music ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : numerics ] we provide numerical results and briefly comment on how to adapt the multifrequency music scheme to work with backscattering data .",

    "<S> furthermore we apply the method to the practically interesting case of multifrequency backscattering data . </S>",
    "<S> numerical examples are presented to document the potentials and limitations of this approach .     </S>",
