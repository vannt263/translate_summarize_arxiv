    "relativistic nearly - ideal hydrodynamics @xcite famously provides a very good quantitative description of azimuthal correlations in high energy nuclear collisions , usually parametrized by @xmath0 coefficients    @xmath1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the reaction plane , determined by geometry .",
    "the quantitative precision of this description , now extending to many fourier coefficients , has motivated the consensus that an `` ideal fluid '' has been created in heavy ion collisions , for which hydrodynamics is a good effective theory even at @xmath3 scales .",
    "however , several phenomenological puzzles have accumulated challenging hydrodynamics as the origin of @xmath0 .    * the near independence of @xmath4 , and particularly @xmath5 , on system size as long as one of the systems is a nucleus @xcite .",
    "this means @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions @xcite give , scaled for geometry , the same azimuthal coefficients as @xmath8 collisions@xcite .",
    "recently , even @xmath9 collisions have been reported to give comparable coefficients @xcite . *",
    "the near independence of @xmath10 on energy and rapidity @xcite , up to very high @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic and transport simulations usually present momentum - integrated @xmath4 , but energy scan simulations where @xmath10 is calculated usually fail @xcite , as transverse flow develops differently in each energy and influences elliptic flow in each bin . * the photon and dielectron @xmath4 are comparable to the hadron @xmath4 .",
    "usual explanations aim to provide an _ enhancement _ of this @xmath0 , but never to explain the _ equality _ @xcite .    summarizing these @xcite , @xmath12 @xmath13    individually",
    ", all these phenomena have been studied , and sometimes even predicted , either by using particular assumptions within hydrodynamic and transport simulations , or by assuming that correlations in small and large systems are of different origin @xcite .",
    "however , taken together they represent a compilation of puzzles which are , at the very least , interesting .",
    "in particular , it has long been pointed out , both by heuristic arguments @xcite and explicit simulations @xcite , that the patterns above pose a problem for the hydrodynamic interpretation of @xmath4 .",
    "close to the hydrodynamic limit , one expects @xmath4 to be :    *   approximately @xmath14 , since @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is small and dimensionless . *",
    "approximately @xmath17 , since @xmath18 , and the dimensionless @xmath19 tracks the equation of state . *   maximum for ideal hydrodynamics , since the knudsen number @xmath20 ,",
    "quantifying the ratio of the mean free path to the system size , is small and dimensionless , @xmath21 . in turn",
    ", the knudsen number is related to the viscosity over entropy density @xmath22 as well as the system size @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "* @xmath25 is a highly non - linear function of the lifetime @xmath26 , @xmath27 , which can be numerically shown to be monotonically saturating , @xmath28 in a cooper - frye freezeout .",
    "@xmath26 is in turn related to the freezeout temperature and energy density @xmath29 . * for @xmath30 and isothermal freeze - out , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 depending on how `` three dimensional '' is the flow",
    ", this relation becomes more complicated , but qualitatively similar for systems at high chemical potential .    in summary ,",
    "elliptic flow in the hydrodynamic limit should scale as    @xmath33    it is clear that only @xmath34 terms mix intensive quantities such as the energy density @xmath35 with extensive ones such as the size @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath36 `` ideal '' terms , except for the initial time @xmath37 , depend purely on intensive quantities , giving rise to scaling between systems of different sizes .    under this scenario ,",
    "the scaling of @xmath10 with energy is puzzling enough , since @xmath4 should increase with energy in _ all _ @xmath11 bins , as transverse flow , increasing for larger and hotter systems in proportion to their longer lifetime , enhances the effect of a given anisotropy at all @xmath11 bins ( this is demonstrated in calculations such as @xcite , where @xmath10 rather than integrated @xmath4 is calculated for different energies ) .",
    "what is also remarkable is that these scalings only work when @xmath0 summed over all particle species is considered .",
    "@xmath38 for @xmath39 , etc .",
    "certainly does not scale with energy @xcite .",
    "this presents a further puzzle when one considers that the total @xmath4 is a sum of species @xmath4 weighted by relative abundance    @xmath40    now , how flow anisotropy is shared between different species is , if one believes the cooper - frye formula @xcite , independent of the relative abundance of these particles , i.e. it just depends on the masses @xmath41 of the particles .",
    "this means that , while @xmath42 depends on @xmath43 via the equation of state and the lifetime , the dependence on @xmath43 of @xmath44 is rather weak .",
    "however , the relative abundance of particles , @xmath45 , strongly and directly depends on @xmath43 .",
    "this means that , in the upper - right sum of eq .",
    "[ masscaling ] the first coefficient is very weakly correlated with the second .",
    "hence , the overall @xmath10 scaling requires a cancellation of quantities that depend on particle abundances and masses in rather different ways .",
    "this is unnatural , yet this is the scaling we see in experimental data @xcite .",
    "the scaling with system size , from @xmath9 to @xmath6 and @xmath7 systems is truly strange , because one naturally expects the opposite .",
    "transverse geometry in @xmath9 and @xmath6 collisions is very similar , whereas it is different in @xmath8 collisions at the same @xmath46 ( since these are more dilute but more spread out ) .",
    "hence , it is naturally expected that similar @xmath46 also has a similar @xmath47 between @xmath9 and @xmath6 , but different ( larger ) ones in @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "instead , all three systems are comparable , though there is room for @xmath47 suppression in @xmath9 .",
    "one could , of course , believe that @xmath0 in peripheral aa , just like pa and pp , is non - hydrodynamic in origin while central @xmath8 is hydrodynamic , but then comparison of lower energy central @xmath8 with @xmath7 and @xmath6 collisions at top rhic / lhc energies , and the observed scaling with @xmath46 alone @xcite , should give this interpretation pause ( a pa , da energy scan at @xmath48 would test this conclusion much more tightly than what is currently available ) .    at higher @xmath11 ,",
    "the hydrodynamic regime is thought to be substituted by the tomographic regime where @xmath0 is still generated in the same sign as hydrodynamics .",
    "the scaling variables , however , should be very different . while the hydrodynamic @xmath0 is generated by gradients and suppressed by viscosities , tomographic @xmath0",
    "is generated via integrated energy losses , which in turn depend on a combination of the traversed path and the local density .",
    "the exact combination is model dependent , but can be phenomenologically parametrized into an `` abc model ''    @xmath49    where @xmath50 approximate the dependence of the rate of energy loss on momentum @xmath51 , temperature @xmath52 , and proper time @xmath53 . in a collisional dominated parton cascade @xmath54 , in a radiative dilute plasma ( `` bethe - heitler regime '' ) @xmath55 , in a dense plasma ( lpm regime ) @xmath56 , while in a `` falling string '' ads / cft scenario @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "hence , one expects the hydrodynamic regime and the tomographic regime to scale very differently with temperature and system size .",
    "the evidence we have , however , is that this scaling is remarkably similar across both energies and system sizes .",
    "if this evidence is confirmed and extended to @xmath6 collisions , particularly in regard to the critical @xmath11 when @xmath0 turns off @xcite , it would imply that low momentum and high momentum @xmath0 s have the same scaling variables , something which fundamentally flies in the face of the `` standard model '' of heavy ion collisions .",
    "all of these puzzles are notable _ not _ because physics seems to be more complicated than our models but , on the contrary , because physics seems remarkably simple across orders of magnitude in energy , system size , and rapidity .",
    "this , and the complication of the current `` standard model '' of heavy ion collisions , makes it desirable to at least attempt to develop a different paradigm of generating @xmath0 , one where the scalings described in this section come naturally .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to do so .",
    "we start @xcite by noting the fact that structure functions @xmath58 and fragmentation functions @xmath59 naturally follow the scaling suggested by both the overlap of @xmath10 and its breakdown by particle species , since both of them depend weakly on momentum exchange @xmath60 but strongly on the rescaled variables @xmath61 @xcite . in structure functions ,",
    "@xmath62 is absorbed into the longitudinal component of momentum , with @xmath63 . in fragmentation functions , @xmath64 but",
    "unitarity protects the effect of fragmentation on all hadrons , @xmath65 .",
    "together , they lead to a particle species dependent @xmath66 with @xmath67 , but a much weaker dependence of total @xmath10 .",
    "hence , if we could just assume that either the structure function acquired an azimuthal dependence having the usual bjorken scaling ( strong and fundamentally non - perturbative dependence on @xmath62 , and logarithmically suppressed dependence on @xmath60 ) , and this azimuthal dependence generated most of @xmath4 , all issues described in this introduction would be naturally resolved .",
    "the equality of photon and hadron @xmath0 is due to the fact that @xmath0 is really an initial state effect .",
    "the scalings with @xmath67 , system size , and rapidity would come from the usual scalings of non - perturbative qcd operators when probed at scales @xmath68 .",
    "both soft and hard @xmath0 would be regulated by the same physical process . if the emc effect has something to do with the observed azimuthal dependence , the hierarchy with system size is also naturally explained .",
    "last but not least , the interplay of particle species would be a consequence of unitarity at fragmentation ( a parton has to fragment to _ something _ ) .",
    "such a `` simple '' suggestion of course is superficially extremely implausible : qcd has azimuthal symmetry , and the parton structure and fragmentation functions are based on factorization at high energy scales .",
    "thus , they are `` universal '' and should not depend on relative angles , even if the target and/or projectile are spatially extended . yet",
    ", ways compatible with @xmath69 to incorporate azimuthal dependence of structure functions do exist .",
    "we certainly know the sivers effect generates just such a solution @xcite .",
    "such a model for @xmath4 is , however , most likely untenable because the angle @xmath70 would have no relation to geometry ( it would be a reflection of the relative spin orientation between nuclei ) , and because it would assign a privileged role for @xmath4 w.r.t . other coefficients .",
    "there are semiclassical qcd models , valid at high occupancy number , where different orientations of semiclassical `` color antennae '' generate azimuthal correlations @xcite , though such mechanisms become negligible in the limit of a large number of randomly - pointing antennae , i.e. in aa systems . as mechanisms like this",
    "are possible for smaller systems , this begs the question of why pa and aa azimuthal correlations look so similar if the underlying processes are different .",
    "more generally @xcite , since the distributions functions depend on the probe used to measure them beyond tree level ( `` run '' ) , a dipole colliding off - center with an extended object will measure azimuthally asymmetric parton distribution functions to one - loop precision ( fig .",
    "[ impact ] ) .",
    "this point is somewhat subtle , since pdfs are an `` initial state '' property of the hadrons wavefunction , which intuitively should not know about the subsequent evolution of the system .",
    "however , within quantum mechanics , the result of the observation in general depends on the observable , even if the observable is an `` initial state '' . in field theory",
    ", this dependence extends to the scale of the measurement : parton distribution functions depend on the scale @xmath60 at which they are probed , even though this scale is obviously external to the hadron . if both the probe and the target are extended , there are two scales , both vector - like : the momentum transfer @xmath71 and the impact parameter @xmath72 . in this regime ,",
    "lorentz symmetry will not constrain the dynamics to depend on @xmath60 , for @xmath73 terms , sensitive to nuclear gradients , are allowed .",
    "this has been found in explicit calculation s , e.g. in @xcite .    assuming nuclear symmetry ( projectile = target ) , each gluon of the projectile hitting the target at a certain impact parameter `` knows '' that the target structure function is slightly ( @xmath74 ) asymmetric w.r.t .",
    "the direction s up and down of the target nucleus .",
    "this asymmetry must go as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the unit vector target radial direction , @xmath77 is the impact in the impact parameter direction , and @xmath78 is the radial gradient in the gluon density . by symmetry , the same effect will happen in the projectile s frame of reference w.r.t .",
    "the target , assumed here to be the same kind of nucleus as the projectile .",
    "any interaction between projectile and target will therefore a cquire a @xmath79 dependence ( fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "it is clear from this figure that such dependence mirrors exactly the initial gradients used to generate @xmath4 by flow , due to the @xmath80 term .",
    "everything said above is easily generalized from an idealized spherically symmetric nucleus to a realistic nucleus with nuclear fluctuations . in that case , the polygons in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] will point in fluctuating directions , generating , in @xmath81 , odd harmonics in precisely the same direction as the density gradients in hydrodynamics . within hydrodynamics , these density gradients will give rise to pressure gradients and ; hence , to flow . in these processes ; however , one interaction is enough to produce an anisotropy of final - state particles .    since the impact parameter @xmath82",
    ", these corrections are expected to be tiny@xmath83 ; hence , provided evolution is linear , their contribution to the observed @xmath0 are smaller by at least an order of magnitude .    in this work ; however , we investigate whether this initial azimuthal symmetry , present at _ moderate _ @xmath84 , can be amplified to lower @xmath84 ( i.e. towards midrapidity ) by the same processes that are thought to lie at the core of saturation physics . if it can , the above anisotropies are indeed tiny at high rapidities , but could be amplified at mid - rapidity , in the same way as cylindrical boundary conditions in a flow of water from a faucet ( fig .",
    "[ faucet ] ) lead to an azimuthally asymmetric turbulent flow when density and flow velocity are high enough .",
    "our analogy here is that the flow is the nucleon s partons flying at the probe at high speed , and the non - linear evolution equation is the one developing turbulence .",
    "the resulting azimuthal anisotropy is then the required order of magnitude larger than the higher twist seed , but still ultimately depends on nuclear gradient ( as in hydrodynamics and experimental data ) and still obeys the scaling laws evident from pqcd ( which would explain the experimental scalings seen in the previous section ) . in particular , since , kinematically @xcite @xmath85 an unstable mode in @xmath62 would grow approximately linearly in @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 ) up until a maximum depending on @xmath88 , reproducing , provided the `` lyapunov exponent '' is approximately constant ( which in an rg evolution it should be ) , the limiting fragmentation of @xmath0 observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "in the next few sections , we will give an outline of how this could work .",
    "the glr equation @xcite is the simplest non - linear correction to gluon evolution at low @xmath62 .",
    "such non - linear corrections are motivated by the breakdown of unitarity at asymptotically high energy due to the divergence of the number of gluons in linear evolution .",
    "going beyond this non - linear correction is a focus of extensive and active research .",
    "the most direct consequence of non - linear evolution is the appearance of a bjorken @xmath62-specific `` saturation scale '' @xmath89 @xcite , where the linear term and the non - linear correction match .",
    "the glr equation has been interpreted , in the past , as evidence that a hierarchy of scales in @xmath90 between valence color charges ( of small characteristic transverse side and high rapidity ) and `` wee gluons '' ( of low @xmath62 and characteristic size @xmath91 ) require a renormalization group approach .",
    "such an approach was developed via the jimwlk and bk equations , and is now firmly established as the `` color glass condensate '' effective theory @xcite .",
    "however , the symmetries of the uv theory can in principle be broken in the ir , via the vacuum ( `` symmetry breaking '' ) or quantum corrections ( `` anomalies '' ) . in these cases , effective theories from the symmetric fixed point will not be realized .",
    "thus , it is not clear that the action in this limit has all the symmetries of qcd . in this work",
    ", we shall examine , starting from the glr equation , the possibility of azimuthal symmetry being broken by nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we note that this setup is very different from the idea of azimuthally asymmetric cgc fields , proposed earlier in @xcite and developed in @xcite , as well as azimuthally asymmetric solutions of the bk equation @xcite . in this case , one solves an azimuthally symmetric lagrangian with asymmetric boundary conditions .",
    "we propose that the lagrangian itself dynamically aquires a preferred direction , something that vanishes in the uv .",
    "while both glr and jimwlk are renormalization group equations , the first ultimately connects hard and soft ( ir and uv ) degrees of freedom ( whose rg running is implied by qcd renormalizability ) , while the second connects central rapidity and large rapidity processes , intrinsically assuming that they develop an rg flow ( a reasonable assumption , but one which a spontaneous breaking of azimuthal symmetry in the mean field would invalidate ) .    as an illustration of the above paragraph",
    ", an azimuthally dependent structure function is part of the wavefunction of _ every _ parton in the nucleon . as such",
    ", it should show up in every cumulant of @xmath0 , just like experimental data seems to be @xcite .",
    "anisotropies described in cgc field - based models , on the other hand , typically decrease with the number of cumulants @xcite .",

    "the full dynamics governing this generalization will be a continuum non - linear partial differential equation , most likely not amenable to analytical solutions .",
    "we note here that instabilities in 2 + 1 continuum partial differential equations typically generate an `` inverse kolmogorov cascade '' @xcite , where low -amplitude high -frequency perturbations coalesce into low -frequency high -amplitude perturbations ( 3 + 1 dimensional instabilities typically behave the opposite way , low frequency / high amplitude @xmath167 high frequency / low amplitude ) .",
    "therefore , in an object extended in transverse area , many randomly pointing antennae , at the @xmath168 target / projectile , will tend to coalesce into a single azimuthal instability at large @xmath169 .",
    "the exact form of this evolution , however , necessitates full control over the @xmath170 term in eq .",
    "[ crossladder ] and will therefore have to be left to a further work .    to compare our results to those of existing literature , we note that while , superficially , the mechanism suggested here looks similar to other initial - state mechanisms for producing @xmath4 @xcite , the fact that @xmath0 is specifically generated by instabilities could be the key of avoiding the many randomly pointing antennae issue which makes these mechanisms untenable for systems with a large number of color domains , such as @xmath0 in @xmath8 collisions .",
    "it also ensures that @xmath0 is present in every cumulant of the particle distribution .    in case of a successful contact with phenomenology ,",
    "an obvious way to experimentally test the ideas discussed in this work is via an @xmath171 collider .",
    "a prediction that can be made is that @xmath171 collisions will give a non - zero @xmath0 , perhaps comparable to the one given in hadronic collisions . of course ,",
    "for such low multiplicity systems some care needs to be taken in defining @xmath0 in such a way that it does not include trivial non - flow effects such as energy momentum conservation and jet fragmentation .",
    "a multiplicity of @xmath172 particles , together with a wide rapidity coverage , is required . in this limit",
    "a `` ridge '' would show up as it does in @xmath173 collisions , as a multiparticle correlation elongated in rapidity both from the recoiling @xmath35 and between each of the few hadronic constituents .",
    "if such a thing is found , it would form evidence that @xmath174 does indeed have an initial azimuthal dependence .    independently from the viability of the alternative proposed here , which , we underline , should be regarded at this point as a speculative suggestion , the phenomenological puzzles highlighted in section [ phenointro ] remain , especially if a tighter scan in energy , rapidity , and system size ( more high rapidity data together with lower energy @xmath175 data ) cements the scaling shown in eq .",
    "[ scale1 ] and [ scale2 ] .    absent a comprehensive explanation of them from hydrodynamics , alternative ideas for the origin of @xmath4 should be explored . existing experimental data , however ,",
    "imposes rather impressive challenges on new ideas for them to be considered viable even qualitatively .",
    "for instance , elliptic flow must depend on geometry , something now established experimentally by measurements of elliptic flow over rapidity @xcite , by measurements of elliptic - flow and spectator correlations @xcite , and by the applicability of event - shape engineering ( @xmath4 is proportional to geometry within each _ event _ , and this is an _ experimental fact _",
    "previous non - hydrodynamic explanations for @xmath4 @xcite did not have such a straight - forward relationship between geometry fourier components and @xmath0 ( in fact , rapidity-@xmath4 correlations were proposed as a signature @xcite for the hydrodynamic origin of @xmath4 ) . neither would a generic azimuthal instability of parton distribution functions , or , for that matter , one triggered by sivers - type processes ( as explained in detail at the end of section [ phenointro ] ) . in a similar vein ,",
    "the generation of @xmath0 must monotonically increase with transverse multiplicity density , independently from system size , for all cumulants , as confirmed by experimental data @xcite .",
    "models whose source are localized color domain walls @xcite can , at most , describe @xmath4 for smaller systems , and have to deal with experimental evidence that small and large systems behave in a surprisingly similar way .",
    "the instability scenario described in this work encouragingly could pass these obstacles .",
    "provided the instability is seeded by nuclear gradients , @xmath0 should be sensitive to initial geometry ( see fig .",
    "[ impact ] ) and be in the same direction with rapidity as it monotonically increases together with parton density .",
    "also , provided the instability in an extended system behaves as an inverse cascade , its dependence on the total multiplicity is likewise monotonically increasing , with different nuclei in a system extended in transverse space aligning the same way as partonic densities increase for smaller rapidities and denser systems .",
    "this means the instability scenario could qualitatively describe the dependence of @xmath0 on both geometry and system size and is therefore a candidate for further development and quantitative testing .    in conclusion",
    ", we have discussed the phenomenological scaling of azimuthal anisotropy coefficients in hadronic collisions , arguing that it suggests an initial state origin compatible with `` bjorken scaling '' phenomenology .",
    "we have also noted that saturation dynamics corresponds also to a regime where azimuthal instabilities , in the full ( 2 + 1 ) evolution equations , could acquire growing modes .",
    "we have used the azimuthally asymmetric glr equation as a laboratory to test these growing modes , and found intriguing hints that they are indeed possible and have some qualitative features required for modeling @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that this model should be developed further in order to connect it with data at a quantitative level , something that we plan to do in a subsequent work .",
