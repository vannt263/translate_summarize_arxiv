    "we next calulate the curvature bispectrum @xmath158 , defined by @xmath159 using the relations above , we can write @xmath160 and then find , @xmath161 a few observations : ( 1 ) it is only the amplitude , not the shape , that depends on the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath7 . ( 2 ) the bispectrum decreases , for fixed @xmath162 , as @xmath163 with increasing @xmath6 , again reflecting that the model should become increasingly gaussian with more fields , a consequence of the central - limit theorem . ( 3 ) the scaling with @xmath164 is @xmath165 , as opposed to the @xmath166 scaling of the local - model bispectrum . in words ,",
    "the non - gaussianity is of order unity , a consequence of the fact that the density perturbation is the square of a gaussian random field [ cf . , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : matterperturbation ] ) ] , rather than something very small , as in inflationary models .",
    "we now put the curvature bispectrum in a slightly more familiar form by defining a non - gaussianity parameter @xmath9 for the model .",
    "to do so , we recall that the local - model prediction for the curvature bispectrum is , @xmath167\\ , , \\label{eqn : localmodelcurvbi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 is the local - model non - gaussianity parameter , defined by writing the curvature as @xmath169 $ ] in terms of a gaussian field @xmath170 .",
    "we now define the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath9 for sosfs by equating the local - model and sosf bispectra for equilateral triangles ; i.e. , equating eqs .",

    "note that @xmath9 is manifestly positive , unlike @xmath176 for the local or equilateral models , which may take on either sign .",
    "as indicated in the introduction , the bispectrum can be probed with the cmb , large - scale structure , and the abundances of objects .",
    "the strongest current constraints to the local - model bispectrum come from the cmb @xcite , followed closely by galaxy - clustering constraints . given that sosfs produce a larger temperature - fluctuation amplitude for a given density - perturbation amplitude , we surmise that the cmb will provide stronger constraints to sosf non - gaussianity than galaxy clustering .",
    "we thus now estimate a constraint to @xmath9 from the cmb .    before doing so , we first caution that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : centralresult ] ) is derived for the curvature perturbation only for modes once they are well within the horizon .",
    "it is thus not , strictly speaking , appropriate for cmb modes @xmath177 .",
    "still , the shape dependence of the bispectrum , and its amplitude relative to the curvature - perturbation amplitude , arises primarily from the quadratic dependence of the density perturbation on the scalar - field perturbation as encoded in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : delta_k ] ) .",
    "the shape dependence of the bispectrum we calculate should thus be at least roughly correct even for @xmath178 .",
    "cmb constraints to @xmath176 are typically applied assuming that the density perturbations are adiabatic , which implies a certain relation , @xmath179 , for the large - angle temperature fluctuation . in our case , though , there is roughly @xmath180 times more @xmath119 for a given @xmath181 than in adiabatic models .",
    "if so , and if all of these temperature fluctuations are due to scalar perturbations ( rather than vector and/or tensor modes ) , then the implied cmb bispectrum should be roughly @xmath182 times larger .",
    "simulations show , though , that only a fraction @xmath183 of the sosf temperature - fluctuation power is due to scalar modes , the rest coming from vector and tensor perturbations @xcite .",
    "the implied cmb bispectrum should thus scale with @xmath184 . combining these scalings with @xmath185",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fnlsigma ] ) ] , the @xmath122 dependence of the cmb bispectrum drops out .",
    "we can therefore apply cmb constraints to @xmath9 by identifying the @xmath176 constraints obtained from the cmb for adiabatic perturbations with @xmath186 . and",
    "one final caveat : we disregard the differences in the temperature power spectra from sosfs and adiabatic perturbations .",
    "keeping these multiple caveats in mind , we proceed with our very rough estimate by noting that the wmap-7 95% c.l .",
    "limit to @xmath187 , the non - gaussianity parameter for the equilateral model , is @xmath188 @xcite ; this bispectrum is maximized for equilateral triangles . on the other hand ,",
    "the sosf bispectrum is maximized for aligned triangles and is zero for squeezed triangles .",
    "we thus conclude that the constraint to @xmath189 will be stronger than that to @xmath187 , but it is not clear  given the different weightings to squeezed and aligned triangles",
    " how it will compare with that to @xmath168 . applying these rough arguments to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fnlsigma ] ) , with @xmath190 , then we estimate a non - gaussianity parameter in excess of the predicted threshold @xmath191 for detection by planck @xcite . for now , however , we simply estimate conservatively that @xmath192 .",
    "we have carried out our calculations in the regime where analytic progress is most easily made  i.e . , modes that have entered the horizon during matter domination and only after those modes have evolved well within the horizon .",
    "strictly speaking , therefore , our calculations apply only to galaxy surveys on _ very _ large scales  those generally larger than extant surveys cover  and possibly to mid - scale regimes in the cmb .",
    "still , our results for the bispectrum can be easily adapted to obtain roughly the bispectrum for smaller - scale modes , those that enter the horizon during radiation domination and those relevant for galaxy surveys .",
    "the calculation for the evolution of these modes is altered by three effects : ( 1 ) the index @xmath193 for the bessel functions in the scalar - field dynamics ( section [ sec : scalarfielddynamics ] ) is different .",
    "however , we have shown that this has no more than an @xmath103 effect on the power - spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "this is simply because the correlations between different fourier modes of the scalar - field energy density are imprinted , through eq .",
    "( [ eqn : delta_k ] ) , by the dependence of those fourier modes on the scalar - field perturbations .",
    "this is the same for modes that enter the horizon during matter and radiation domination .",

    "if some post - inflationary physics involves the spontaneous breaking of an exact @xmath3 symmetry with @xmath201 , then the ordering of these scalar fields may provide a secondary contribution to primordial perturbations .",
    "current constraints allow up to @xmath5 of the power in primordial perturbations to be due to sosfs .",
    "sosf models are appealing from the theoretical perspective because they are simple , well - defined , and parametrized only by the symmetry - breaking scale @xmath7 and number @xmath6 of fields .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the matter and curvature bispectra induced by the ordering of such scalar fields . given that the density perturbation is quadratic in the scalar - field perturbation ,",
    "sosf density perturbations are expected to be highly non - gaussian , and if so , measurements of non - gaussianity may provide the means to test these models .    here",
    "we have calculated analytically the bispectrum due to sosfs and presented results in a way that should be easily accessible to those doing measurements with the cmb and large - scale structure .",
    "we find that the triangle - shape dependence of the bispectrum peaks for aligned triangles , unlike the local - model bispectrum , which is largest for squeezed triangles , and the equilateral bispectrum , which is largest for equilateral triangles . we have estimated a current upper limit to the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath9 for the model and find that the implied constraints to the @xmath7-@xmath6 sosf parameter space are competitive with those from the upper limit to cmb temperature fluctuations .",
    "finally , we have already argued above , in section [ sec : currentconstraints ] , that the correlation of modes will be similar for the large - scale modes as they enter the horizon , those relevant for large - angle cmb fluctuations .",
    "we therefore believe that rough constraints to the model can be derived from cmb measurements by assuming that the curvature bispectrum we calculate is the primordial one .",
    "clearly , there is room for further numerical work to test our assumptions and to make our predictions more precise . in the meantime , though , we believe that our analytic approximation captures the essential physics and that our bispectrum can be used in the meantime as a `` working - horse '' model to derive constraints , from non - gaussianity measurements , to this interesting class of models for secondary contributions to primordial perturbations .    finally , we note that the model makes a number of other predictions . given that density perturbations are actively generated as new modes come within the horizon , vector and tensor modes will be excited , and these may give rise to interesting polarization signals @xcite in the cmb and perhaps excite b modes @xcite in the cmb that might be distinguished from those due to inflation @xcite .",

    "<S> the universe may harbor relics of the post - inflationary epoch in the form of a network of self - ordered scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> such fossils , while consistent with current cosmological data at trace levels , may leave too weak an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large - scale distribution of matter to allow for direct detection . </S>",
    "<S> the non - gaussian statistics of the density perturbations induced by these fields , however , permit a direct means to probe for these relics . here </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the bispectrum that arises in models of self - ordered scalar fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find a compact analytic expression for the bispectrum , evaluate it numerically , and provide a simple approximation that may be useful for data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the bispectrum is largest for triangles that are aligned ( have edges @xmath0 ) as opposed to the local - model bispectrum , which peaks for squeezed triangles ( @xmath1 ) , and the equilateral bispectrum , which peaks at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that this non - gaussianity should be detectable by the planck satellite if the contribution from self - ordering scalar fields to primordial perturbations is near the current upper limit . </S>"
