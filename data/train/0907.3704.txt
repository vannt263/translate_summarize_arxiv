    "let @xmath26 be a distribution over a set @xmath27 , where we write @xmath28 for the probability of choosing a particular element @xmath11 .",
    "the _ rnyi entropy _",
    "@xcite of this distribution is defined as @xmath29 for any @xmath30 .",
    "it will be useful to note that the rnyi entropy is in fact related to the @xmath31-norm of the vector @xmath32 of probabilities @xmath33 by taking the logarithm @xmath34 a special case of the rnyi entropy is the well - known shannon entropy  @xcite obtained by taking the limit @xmath35 we are especially interested in the so - called _ collision entropy _ , that is , the rnyi entropy of order @xmath36 given by @xmath37 and the _ min - entropy _ given by the limit @xmath38 as @xmath39 the rnyi entropies are monotonically decreasing in @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , we thus have @xmath42 .",
    "note that any such entropies can take on values in the interval @xmath43 , where the lower bound is clearly attained if the distribution is sharply defined with @xmath44 for some @xmath11 , and the upper bound is attained when @xmath45 is the uniform distribution .    in the following ,",
    "we will write @xmath46 to denote the entropy arising from a measurement in an orthonormal basis @xmath47\\}$ ] and use @xmath48 to denote the entropy arising from measuring with observables @xmath49 given by the projectors @xmath50 .      an intriguing question is to find measurements which are very incompatible , in the sense that the r.h.s of   is very large",
    ". we will refer to this as a _ strong uncertainty relation_. note that given any set of projective measurements @xmath22 , we can always find a state @xmath15 such that @xmath51 for one of the measurements @xmath16 , namely by choosing @xmath15 to be an eigenstate of one of the measurement operators .",
    "we thus know that the r.h.s of   can never exceed @xmath52 if for any choice of measurements the lower bound is given by @xmath53 , we know that if @xmath15 has zero entropy for one of the measurements , the entropy is maximal for all others .",
    "we call a set of measurements that satisfy this property _ maximally incompatible _ , and refer to the corresponding uncertainty relation as being _",
    "maximally strong_. as outlined below , mutually unbiased bases lead to maximally strong uncertainty relations for @xmath25 measurements .",
    "this however does not hold in general for the case of @xmath54 .",
    "we will also see that maximally incompatible measurements can be found for any @xmath55 if we only consider @xmath56 outcomes .    for measurements in different  _ bases _ , note that all bases must be mutually unbiased in order for us to obtain strong uncertainty relations : suppose two bases @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not mutually unbiased , and there exist two basis vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 that have higher overlap @xmath61 .",
    "then choosing @xmath62 yields zero entropy when measured in basis @xmath57 and less than full entropy when measured in the basis @xmath58 .",
    "since mutually unbiased bases play an important role in the study of uncertainty relations , we briefly review two well - known constructions for which particular uncertainty relations are known to hold .",
    "[ def - mub ] let @xmath63 and @xmath64 be two orthonormal bases in @xmath65 .",
    "they are said to be _ mutually unbiased _ if @xmath66 , for every @xmath67 $ ] .",
    "a set @xmath68 of orthonormal bases in @xmath65 is called a _ set of mutually unbiased bases _ if each pair of bases is mutually unbiased .",
    "for example , the well - known computational and hadamard basis are mutually unbiased .",
    "we use @xmath69 to denote the maximal number of mubs in dimension @xmath70 . in any dimension @xmath70",
    ", we have that @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath72 is a prime power , we have that @xmath73 and explicit constructions are known  @xcite . if @xmath74 is a square , @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the number of mutually orthogonal @xmath77 latin squares  @xcite . in general , we have @xmath78 for all @xmath79  @xcite . from this",
    "it follows that in any dimension , there is an explicit construction for 3 mubs  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , not much else is known .",
    "for example , it is still an open problem whether there exists a set of @xmath80 ( or even @xmath81 ! ) mubs in dimension @xmath82 . in this text",
    ", we refer to two specific constructions of mutually unbiased bases .",
    "there exists a third construction based on galois rings  @xcite , which we do not consider here , since we do not know of any specific uncertainty relations in this setting .",
    "first , we consider mubs based on mutually orthogonal latin squares  @xcite .",
    "informally , an @xmath77 latin square over the symbol set @xmath83 $ ] is an arrangement of elements of @xmath83 $ ] into an @xmath77 square such that in each row and each column every element occurs exactly once .",
    "let @xmath84 denote the entry in a latin square in row @xmath85 and column @xmath86 .",
    "two latin squares @xmath55 and @xmath87 are called mutually orthogonal if and only if @xmath88\\ } = \\{(u , v)|u , v \\in [ s]\\}$ ] .",
    "intuitively , this means that if we place one square on top of the other , and look at all pairs generated by the overlaying elements , all possible pairs occur .",
    "an example is given in figure  [ latinsquaremols ] below . from any @xmath89 latin square",
    "we can obtain a basis for @xmath90 .",
    "first , we construct @xmath91 of the basis vectors from the entries of the latin square itself .",
    "let @xmath92 } e^l_{i , j}(\\ell ) \\ket{i , j},\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is a predicate such that @xmath94 if and only if @xmath95 .",
    "note that for each @xmath96 we have exactly @xmath91 pairs @xmath97 such that @xmath98 , because each element of @xmath83 $ ] occurs exactly @xmath91 times in the latin square .",
    "secondly , from each such vector we obtain @xmath99 additional vectors by adding successive rows of an @xmath77 complex hadamard matrix @xmath100 as coefficients to obtain the remaining @xmath101 for @xmath102 $ ] , where @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "two additional mubs can then be obtained in the same way from the two non - latin squares where each element occurs for an entire row or column respectively . from each mutually orthogonal latin square and these two extra squares which also satisfy the above orthogonality condition",
    ", we obtain one basis .",
    "this construction therefore gives @xmath106 many mubs .",
    "it is known that if @xmath107 is a prime power itself , we obtain @xmath108 mubs from this construction . note , however , that there do exist many more mubs in prime power dimensions , namely @xmath109 .",
    "if @xmath91 is not a prime power , it is merely known that @xmath110  @xcite .            as an example , consider the first @xmath111 latin square depicted in figure  [ latinsquaremols ] and the @xmath111 complex hadamard matrix @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "first , we obtain vectors @xmath114 with the help of @xmath115 we obtain 3 additional vectors from the ones above . from the vector @xmath116 , for example",
    ", we obtain @xmath117 this gives us basis @xmath118\\}$ ] for @xmath119 .",
    "the construction of another basis follows in exactly the same way from a mutually orthogonal latin square .",
    "the fact that two such squares @xmath55 and @xmath87 are mutually orthogonal ensures that the resulting bases will be mutually unbiased . indeed , suppose we are given another such basis , @xmath120\\}$ ] belonging to @xmath87 .",
    "we then have for any @xmath121 $ ] that latexmath:[$|{\\langle{u_{1,\\ell'}}|{v_{1,\\ell}}\\rangle}|^2 =    as there exists exactly only one pair @xmath121 $ ] such that @xmath123 .",
    "clearly , the same argument holds for the additional vectors derived from the complex hadamard matrix .",
    "the second construction we consider is based on the generalized pauli matrices @xmath124 and @xmath125  @xcite , defined by their actions on the computational basis @xmath126 as follows : @xmath127 where @xmath128 .",
    "we say that @xmath129 for @xmath130 and @xmath131 $ ] is a _ string of pauli matrices_. note that for @xmath132 these are just the usual pauli matrices .",
    "if @xmath70 is a prime , it is known that the @xmath109 mubs constructed first by wootters and fields  @xcite can also be obtained as the eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "if @xmath72 is a prime power , consider all @xmath134 possible strings of pauli matrices excluding the identity and group them into sets @xmath135 such that @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath138 and all elements of @xmath139 commute .",
    "let @xmath140 be the common eigenbasis of all elements of @xmath139 .",
    "then @xmath141 are mubs  @xcite .",
    "a similar result for @xmath142 has also been shown in  @xcite .",
    "a special case of this construction are the three mutually unbiased bases in dimension @xmath143 given by the unitaries @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 applied to the computational basis , where @xmath115 is the hadamard transform and @xmath147 .",
    "a simple example of this construction are the mutually unbiased bases in dimension @xmath132 which are given by the eigenvectors of the pauli matrices @xmath6 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "a very interesting aspect of such mutually unbiased bases is that there exists an ordering @xmath150 and a unitary @xmath151 that cyclically permutes all bases , that is , @xmath152 for all @xmath86 , where @xmath153  @xcite .",
    "the case of two measurements ( @xmath25 ) is reasonably well understood in any dimension , and for any number of outcomes .",
    "this case was of particular interest as is directly inspired by the two measurements for which heisenberg had originally formulated his uncertainty relation , i.e. , position and momentum .",
    "we begin by recalling some of the history of this fascinating problem , before reviewing the currently relevant results .",
    "the first entropic uncertainty relation was given by  @xcite for position and momentum observables , which was improved by the inequalities of  @xcite and the entropic uncertainty relations of  @xcite to an entropic uncertainty relation for systems of @xmath154 canonical pairs of position and momentum coordinates @xmath155 and @xmath156 : @xmath157 where @xmath158 refers to the ( differential ) shannon entropy of the joint distribution of the coordinates @xmath159 when measured on the state @xmath15 .",
    "that entropic uncertainty relations are of great importance was pointed out by  @xcite , who proved that for measurements in two bases @xmath49 and @xmath160 we have @xmath161 where @xmath162 .",
    "we will see later that the same bound holds for the min - entropies @xmath163 .",
    "his results were extended to a continuous setting for angle - angular momentum and position and momentum by  @xcite , which in turn was improved by  @xcite .",
    "different relations for particular angular momentum observables were later also derived by  @xcite .",
    "a rnyi entropic version of such an uncertainty relation may be found in  @xcite .        following a conjecture by kraus  @xcite , maassen and uffink",
    "@xcite improved deutsch s uncertainty relation for measurements in two different bases . in particular , they showed that if we measure any state @xmath164 with @xmath165 using observables with orthonormal eigenbases @xmath166 and @xmath167 respectively , we have @xmath168 where @xmath162 .",
    "since @xmath169 is concave in @xmath2 , this result also applies to mixed states @xmath15 .",
    "what is the strongest possible relation we could obtain ? that is , which choices of @xmath49 and @xmath160 maximize the r.h.s . of equation ( [ eq : mubound ] ) ?",
    "it turns out that the maximum is reached when the two bases are mutually unbiased ( see section  [ sec : mub ] ) i.e.  when all the inner products on the right hand side above are equal to @xmath170 .",
    "we then obtain that the entropy sum is lower bounded by @xmath171 .",
    "this is tight , as the example of @xmath172 shows",
    ". note that for general observables , this lower bound is not necessarily tight , but its usefulness lies in the fact that it is in terms of _ very simple _ geometric information of the relative position of the bases .      for dimension @xmath132",
    "optimal uncertainty relations have been obtained for two observables @xmath173 and @xmath174 where @xmath175 , for some angles of the bloch vectors @xmath176 analytically , and for others numerically  @xcite .",
    "uncertainty relations which give improved bounds for a large class of measurements in two different bases @xmath49 and @xmath160 have also been obtained in  @xcite for the case that the overlap between two basis vectors is large , that is , @xmath177 .",
    "letting @xmath178 , the following analytical bound is shown for this regime @xmath179 and a numerical bound is provided that is slightly better for @xmath180 .",
    "it is an often overlooked fact that maassen and uffink actually also show uncertainty relations in terms of the rnyi entropies . in particular , they extend a result by  @xcite to show that for any @xmath2 @xmath181\\ .\\ ] ] to see that this bound can be tight for some choices of @xmath49 and @xmath160 , consider two mutually unbiased bases in dimension @xmath132 .",
    "for example , the computational @xmath182 and the hadamard basis @xmath183 .",
    "the lower bound then becomes @xmath184 , which is attained for @xmath185 .",
    "they furthermore use a result for @xmath31-norms  @xcite to show that the following relation holds in terms for rnyi entropies of order @xmath31 and @xmath186 satisfying @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xmath189 for any state @xmath2 , which gave the result for the shannon entropy above in the limit of @xmath190 .        the result by  @xcite has been extended to the case of a general povm .",
    "the first such result was given by  @xcite , who pointed out that their result can easily be extended to the case of rank one povms .",
    "his result was subsequently strengthened  @xcite by noting that any two povms @xmath191 and @xmath192 acting on the hilbert space @xmath10 have a naimark extension to an ancillary space @xmath193 such that @xmath194 , and @xmath195 for any unitary @xmath196 acting only on @xmath193 , where @xmath197 form an orthonormal bases on the ancillary system . maximizing over such unitaries , that is , possible extensions of the povm , one obtains the bound @xmath198 any state @xmath199 .",
    "the general setting was analyzed by  @xcite who showed that @xmath200 for any povms @xmath201 and @xmath202 and any state @xmath199 .",
    "entropic uncertainty relations for rnyi entropies have also been obtained for the case of povms . in particular , it has been shown by  @xcite that for any two povms @xmath203 and @xmath204 and any state @xmath205 we have @xmath206\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath207 .      in the context of quantum information theoretical applications",
    "some other uncertainty relations were discovered , which are entropic in spirit , but lie outside of the formalism introduced above .",
    "here we quote two , which can be viewed as extensions of the inequality of  @xcite in the case of two measurement bases related by the fourier transform , to multipartite quantum systems and involving the von neumann entropy @xmath208 . with this entropy",
    ", one can formally construct a mutual information and a conditional entropy , respectively , for bipartite states @xmath209 with marginals @xmath210 and @xmath211 : @xmath212 both inequalities compare two conjugate bases , i.e.  without loss of generality , one is the standard basis @xmath213 , the other one its fourier transform @xmath214 .",
    "( these are just the eigenbases of the generalized @xmath148 and @xmath6 pauli operators . )",
    "denote the projections onto these bases by @xmath215 , @xmath216 , respectively : @xmath217    the first uncertainty relation is by  @xcite : for a bipartite quantum state @xmath209 such that @xmath218 is maximally mixed , @xmath219    the second is by  @xcite , who show similarly that for any tripartite state @xmath220 , @xmath221 note that this directly reduces to ( [ eq : mubound ] ) for trivial systems @xmath1 and @xmath222  which is why @xcite conjecture the following inequality when @xmath215 and @xmath216 are more generally the projections onto two arbitrary bases @xmath223 and @xmath224 , respectively : @xmath225",
    "we now review the known results for entropic uncertainty relations for more than two measurement settings . rather little is known in this scenario , except for a number of special cases .",
    "in particular , it is an interesting open question whether strong uncertainty relations even exist for a small constant number of measurement settings and more than two measurement outcomes . as pointed out already in the beginning , this is conceivable because unlike canonically conjugate variables , which come in pairs , there are generally more than two mutually unbiased observables .",
    "first of all , it may not be at all obvious that strong uncertainty relations can even be obtained at all for more than two measurement settings , independent of the number of measurement outcomes .",
    "we will use @xmath226 where @xmath227 forms an orthonormal basis for @xmath10 to denote the basis obtained by rotating the standard basis into the basis determined by the unitary @xmath228 .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that @xmath229 unitaries @xmath228 chosen from the haar measure randomly and independently obey @xmath230 with high probability , and for sufficiently large dimension @xmath70 .",
    "it is important to note that the number of measurement settings is not constant but depends on the dimension .",
    "now that we know that it is in principle possible to obtain reasonably strong uncertainty relations , can we construct explicit measurements for which we obtain such relations ? recall that it is a necessary condition for bases to be mutually unbiased in order to obtain a maximally strong uncertainty relation in the first place .",
    "given the fact that if we have two measurement settings , choosing the measurement bases to be mutually unbiased leads to maximally strong uncertainty relations , it may be tempting to conclude that choosing our measurements to be mutually unbiased is in general also a sufficient condition . perhaps surprisingly ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "we first consider the case of all @xmath109 mutually unbiased bases , for which we _ can _ obtain strong uncertainty relations .",
    "in particular , @xcite has shown that for the mutually unbiased bases @xmath150 we have for any state @xmath15 @xmath231 if the dimension @xmath70 is even , this can further be improved to  @xcite @xmath232\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in dimension @xmath132 , the latter bound gives @xmath233 , which is tight for the mutually unbiased bases given by the eigenvectors of the pauli matrices @xmath6 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the case of @xmath132 was also addressed separately in  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the first bound   is in fact obtained by first lower bounding the shannon entropy @xmath169 by the collision entropy @xmath234 , and then one proves that @xmath235 this inequality can also be proven using the fact that a full set of mutually unbiased bases forms a @xmath236-design  @xcite , and we provide a completely elementary proof of this inequality in the appendix .",
    "interestingly , it has been shown  @xcite that the states @xmath15 minimizing the l.h.s of   are states which are invariant under a unitary transformation that permutes the mutually unbiased bases as discussed in section  [ sec : mub ] .      what about less than @xmath109 mutually unbiased bases ?",
    "first of all , note that it is easy to see that we do not always obtain a maximally strong uncertainty relation in this setting .",
    "consider dimension @xmath237 and three mutually unbiased bases @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath238 given by the eigenvectors of @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 respectively .",
    "then a simple calculation shows that for example for the state @xmath242 we have @xmath243 for all bases @xmath244 and hence @xmath245 in  @xcite ( see the eprint version ) numerical work on three and more mutually unbiased bases in prime dimensions up to @xmath246 is reported , which are consistent with a behavior of @xmath247 of @xmath248 .",
    "the mutually unbiased bases are taken as a subset of the mubs constructed via the generalized pauli matrices in prime power dimension .",
    "trivial bounds for more than two and less than @xmath109 can be derived quite easily .",
    "for example , for any number of mutually unbiased bases @xmath249 we obtain by combining   for each pair of bases @xmath250 and",
    "@xmath251 that @xmath252 as shown in the appendix , it is also easy to see that @xmath253    curiously , it turns out  @xcite that in square prime power dimensions @xmath254 there exist up to @xmath255 mubs derived from the generalized pauli matrices for which we obtain extremely weak uncertainty relations ! in particular , we have for any such set of mubs that the lower bound of   can be attained , that is , @xmath256 furthermore , the same is true for _ all _ mutually unbiased bases derived from latin squares . these results clearly show that mutual unbiasedness is _ not _ enough to obtain strong uncertainty relations . combined with the numerical results from above , we also note that the dimension @xmath70 , as well as the choice of mutually unbiased bases may indeed matter . in  @xcite it was noted that the set of mutually unbiased bases derived from the generalized pauli matrices for which we obtain weak uncertainty relations are exactly those which are separable across the space @xmath257 .",
    "however , we can now conclude from the results of  @xcite that there is nothing inherently special about these separable bases , since there exists a unitary @xmath151 that maps them to a set of entangled bases ( see section  [ sec : mub ] ) .",
    "it has also been shown by  @xcite that for any three bases from the `` standard '' mutually unbiased bases construction in prime power dimension the lower bound can not exceed @xmath258 , for large dimension , and assuming the generalized riemann hypothesis . furthermore , for any @xmath259 , there always exist @xmath260 many of these bases such that the lower bound can not be larger than @xmath261 .",
    "it remains an interesting open question to show tight uncertainty relations for all mutually unbiased bases .",
    "maximally strong uncertainty relations are known to exist for any number of measurement settings @xmath55 , if we limit ourselves to @xmath262 outcomes .",
    "these uncertainty relations are derived for generators of a clifford algebra  @xcite , which has many beautiful geometrical properties . for any integer @xmath154 , the free real associative algebra generated by @xmath263 , subject to the anti - commutation relations @xmath264",
    "is called _",
    "clifford algebra_. it has a unique representation by hermitian matrices on @xmath154 qubits ( up to unitary equivalence ) .",
    "this representation can be obtained via the famous jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite : @xmath265 for @xmath266 , where we use @xmath6 , @xmath149 and @xmath148 to denote the pauli matrices .",
    "an additional such matrix can be found by taking the product @xmath267 , which is sometimes known as the pseudo - scalar . to see how such operators are observables with two measurement outcomes ,",
    "note that the eigenvalues of @xmath268 always come in pairs : let @xmath269 be an eigenvector of @xmath268 with eigenvalue @xmath270 . from @xmath271 we have that @xmath272 .",
    "note that both @xmath273 occur since we have @xmath274 .",
    "we can therefore express each @xmath268 as @xmath275 where @xmath276 and @xmath277 are projectors onto the positive and negative eigenspace of @xmath268 respectively .",
    "furthermore , note that we have for @xmath278 @xmath279 that is , all such operators are orthogonal . to gain some intuition of why such operators may give good uncertainty relations note that the positive and negative eigenspaces of such operators are mutually unbiased ( analogous to bases ) , since for all @xmath138 , and an arbitrary eigenvector @xmath280 of @xmath268 , @xmath281 hence",
    ", if we were measure the maximally mixed state on the positive eigenspace of @xmath282 with any of the other observables , the probability of obtaining a measurement outcome of 0 is the same as for obtaining outcome 1 . for simplicity ,",
    "we will write @xmath283 .    it was shown  @xcite that the following maximally strong uncertainty relation holds for any set of anti - commuting observables @xmath284 @xmath285 for dimension @xmath132 , this reduces to an uncertainty relation for the mutually unbiased bases given by the eigenvectors of @xmath6 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively . for the collision entropy ,",
    "the bound becomes @xmath286 and for the min - entropy we have @xmath287 interestingly , uncertainty relations for anti - commuting observables can also be used to prove tsirelson s bound  @xcite .",
    "it is not known how to extend this result to more than two measurement outcomes .",
    "one may conjecture that the generalized clifford algebra generated by operators @xmath288 , where for all @xmath138 we have @xmath289 with @xmath290 may give strong uncertainty relations for measurements with @xmath96 measurement outcomes .",
    "however , the example for @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath241 given above , and numerical evidence for higher dimensions refute this conjecture .",
    "uncertainty relations for measurements in different bases have recently played an important role in proving security of cryptographic protocols in the bounded  @xcite and noisy - storage model  @xcite respectively . here , uncertainty relations are used to bound the information that a cheating party has about bits which are encoded into several possible bases , where the choice of basis is initially unknown to him .",
    "the simplest example is an encoding of a single bit @xmath291 into either the computational ( as @xmath292 ) or hadamard basis ( as @xmath293 ) .",
    "suppose we choose the bit @xmath294 , as well as the basis uniformly at random , and suppose further that the cheating party is allowed to perform any measurement on the encoded qubit giving him some classical information @xmath295 .",
    "after his measurement , we provide him with the basis information @xmath296 .",
    "it can be shown using a purification argument , that we can turn the uncertainty relation for the min - entropy for the computational @xmath57 and hadamard basis @xmath58 ( see  ) @xmath297 into the following bound for the adversary s knowledge about the bit @xmath298 given @xmath295 and the basis information @xmath296 @xmath299 the conditional min - entropy thereby has a very intuitive interpretation as @xmath300 , where @xmath301 is the average probability that the cheating party can guess @xmath298 given @xmath295 and @xmath296 , maximized over all strategies  @xcite .    in a cryptographic setting , we are especially interested in the case where we repeat the encoding above many times .",
    "suppose we choose an @xmath154-bit string @xmath302 uniformly at random , and encode each bit in either the computational or hadamard basis , also chosen uniformly and independently at random .",
    "using the sdp formalism of  @xcite it is easily seen  @xcite that this gives us @xmath303 in the limit of large @xmath154 , it is known that for independent states , the min - entropy behaves approximately like the shannon entropy  @xcite .",
    "this allows one to turn the uncertainty relation of  @xcite for the shannon entropy into a better bound on the adversaries knowledge about the long string @xmath302 in terms of the min - entropy .",
    "more precisely , it is known  @xcite that @xmath304 for @xmath305 , where @xmath306 is the @xmath307-smooth min - entropy defined in  @xcite .",

    "it is an interesting open question , whether one can find good uncertainty relations for higher designs .",
    "the most interesting open problem , however , is to find any sets of measurements at all for which we do obtain maximally strong uncertainty relations for more than two measurement settings , and a constant number of measurement outcomes @xmath311 .",
    "note that always @xmath312 for any set of measurements @xmath313 with outcomes in the set @xmath27 .",
    "the problem of the entropic uncertainty relations at its most general is to find an expression , or at least a lower bound , for the quantity @xmath24 in `` simple '' terms of the geometry of the measurements @xmath16 .    for measurements in different bases , which are of special interest for example in locking applications  @xcite ,",
