    "<S> we consider atoms interacting each other through the topological structure of a complex network and investigate lattice vibrations of the system , the quanta of which we call _ netons _ for convenience . </S>",
    "<S> the density of neton levels , obtained numerically , reveals that unlike a local regular lattice , the system develops a gap of a finite width , manifesting extreme rigidity of the network structure at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> two different network models , the small - world network and the scale - free network , are compared : the characteristic structure of the former is described by an additional peak in the level density whereas a power - law tail is observed in the latter , indicating excitability of netons at arbitrarily high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the gap width is also found to vanish in the small - world network when the connection range @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> a variety of network systems such as computer networks , neuronal networks , biochemical networks and social networks , possesses complex topological structure , which can be described neither by regular networks nor by completely random networks  @xcite . among various models for generating such complex networks , the watts - strogatz ( ws ) model  @xcite and the barabsi - albert ( ba ) model  @xcite provide the two most representative ones . </S>",
    "<S> both model networks are characterized by very small network diameters proportional to the logarithm of the network size , which is dubbed `` small - world behavior '' and commonly observed in various real networks . </S>",
    "<S> other important properties of many real network systems include high clustering  @xcite and scale - free degree distributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while most existing studies of complex networks have focused on the geometrical and topological characterization , there now emerges an increasing number of studies paying attention to the dynamics defined on the networks .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice vibrations and associated phonon excitations on local regular networks , e.g. , one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains or two - dimensional square lattices , have been a textbook example of the introductory solid - state physics . in the case of such regular networks , atoms located on vertices interact only with nearest neighboring atoms , resulting in the standard linear phonon dispersion . on the other hand , when the interaction between atoms takes the form of the connection topology of a complex network , ingredients of long - range nature enter into the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ws network has both local edges and long - range shortcuts  @xcite , which in this work are interpreted as the coexistence of the local and the long - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> existing studies on phonon excitations have mostly been performed on the local regular networks such as @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattices or on the fractal geometry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the spectral properties of lattice vibrations have been studied in a small - world network similar to the ws network  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , effects of the local interaction range and the dependence of the spectral properties on the rewiring probability have not been investigated in detail .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of this work is to study in detail the vibration spectra of both the ws network and the ba network , in comparison with those of regular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider atoms located on vertices of a complex network and interacting with each other connected via edges of the network , and investigate lattice vibrations and phonon excitations , with emphasis on the effects of the network topology . </S>",
    "<S> the results of such study can have implications in the mechanical property of a system of long chains bent in a complicated way . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a bundle of long flexible polymer chains , some monomers which were separated by a long distance along a chain can make new couplings , building shortcuts . throughout this work </S>",
    "<S> , we refer to phonons in a complex network as _ netons _ , to manifest qualitatively different characteristics due to the fact that the underlying geometric structure is not a usual periodic lattice . by means of numerical diagonalization of the dynamic matrix , neton </S>",
    "<S> excitation spectra are obtained and the corresponding density of neton levels are computed . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that the complex network in general has a finite gap in the level density , indicating the absence of low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the gap width on the rewiring probability and the local interaction range is investigated in detail . the existence of the gap is also reflected by the vanishingly small specific heat at low temperatures . in the ws network three singularities </S>",
    "<S> are observed in the neton level density : among them two are shown to be reminiscence of the van hove singularity present in the local regular network , while the third one originates from the complex network structure . </S>",
    "<S> the ba network is also considered and the scale - freeness results in a power - law distribution of the level density , suggesting excitability of netons with arbitrarily high energies .    </S>",
    "<S> we build the ws network following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : first , a 1d regular network with only local connections of range @xmath2 is constructed under the periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> next , each local edge ( or link ) is visited once , and with the rewiring probability @xmath3 removed and reconnected to a randomly chosen vertex . </S>",
    "<S> after a whole sweep over the entire network , the average number of shortcuts in the system of size @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 . in the ws network built as above , an atom is put on every vertex whereas an edge connecting two vertices represents the coupling between the two atoms located at the two vertices . for simplicity , we assume that all atoms are identical , each having mass @xmath6 and moving only along the direction of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the @xmath7th atom at the position @xmath8 then reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the set of vertices connected to the @xmath7th vertex ( via either local edges or shortcuts ) and the interaction strength @xmath11 is assumed to be the same for any pairs of the interacting atoms .    in the absence of shortcuts , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : motion ] ) describes a 1d chain of atoms with only local connections up to the @xmath2th nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic solution in this limit of @xmath12 is easily found to take the form : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the interparticle spacing , @xmath15 is the eigenfrequency and the periodic boundary conditions , @xmath16 , restrict the wavenumber @xmath17 to take the value @xmath18 with integer @xmath19 . for simplicity , we set @xmath20 , and obtain @xmath21 which leads to the dispersion relation @xmath22 for small wave numbers ( @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : rsmall ] ) shows that @xmath24 regardless of the local interaction range @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> such linear dependence of the frequency @xmath15 on the wavenumber @xmath17 implies that the group velocity equals the phase velocity , both of which are frequency independent . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth we measure the frequency @xmath15 in units of @xmath25 for convenience .    in the presence of shortcuts @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> , the plane wave solution fails , owing to the lack of the translational symmetry . substituting @xmath27 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : motion ] ) , we write the equation of motion in the matrix form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath4-dimensional column vector with the components @xmath30 @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath32 dynamic matrix @xmath33 has the elements @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the number of vertices connected directly to the @xmath36th vertex via local edges or shortcuts . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that @xmath37 lacks the translational symmetry due to the existence of shortcuts . we have performed numerical diagonalization of the dynamic matrix @xmath33 for various network sizes @xmath38 , 200 , 400 , and 800 , only to find insignificant difference between the two largest sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenfrequencies found numerically for given network realization are sorted in the ascending order and an integer label @xmath19 is attached from the lowest eigenfrequency ( @xmath39 for the smallest @xmath15 , @xmath40 for the next smallest @xmath15 , and so on ) . to obtain better statistics , </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered 1000 - 10000 different network realizations , over which averages are taken .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : wk ] shows the neton frequency @xmath15 versus the _ quasi - wavenumber _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 at various values of the rewiring probability @xmath3 for the local interaction range ( a ) @xmath0 and ( b ) @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the quasi - wavenumber @xmath43 becomes identical to the true wavenumber @xmath17 only when @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the wavenumber @xmath17 is not appropriate for the system in the presence of shortcuts ( @xmath44 ) : it does not make a good quantum number for @xmath44 , where the translational symmetry is broken . for the range @xmath45 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](a ) suggests that the linear dispersion relation @xmath46 , which has been obtained analytically in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rsmall ] ) for @xmath12 , still appears to hold at any value of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the local interaction range @xmath42 , the dispersion @xmath47 changes its functional form as @xmath3 is raised from zero , reducing to the linear relation @xmath46 only in the limit of @xmath48 [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](b ) that for @xmath49 there appears a nonzero minimum value of @xmath15 , below which the eigenfrequency does not exist . </S>",
    "<S> we have also examined the cases with the range larger than two ( @xmath50 ) and confirmed that these features remain qualitatively the same . with regard to this , it is of much interest to note that the ws network has a finite clustering coefficient  @xcite , only when @xmath51  @xcite , which makes it plausible that the difference in the neton frequency spectrum between the cases @xmath45 and @xmath42 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , is a manifestation of the clustering effects . </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered numerically the decomposition property of the network and found that while the ws network with @xmath51 does not decompose into distinct parts , for @xmath45 the probability of decomposition is finite . however , it should be noted that those networks with @xmath45 which are not decomposed still display the vanishing gap . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the vanishing gap in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](a ) for @xmath45 has its origin not in the decomposition property but presumably in the clustering property of the network . </S>",
    "<S> similar ws networks can also be built in a slightly different manner : instead of rewiring local connections with the total number of edges fixed , one may _ </S>",
    "<S> add _ shortcuts to the network without removing local connections . in this case , we have confirmed numerically that there exists a gap even for @xmath45 , which keeps parallel to the observation that the @xmath52 model on the ws network with @xmath45 , constructed in such a way , has a finite - temperature transition , similar to that in the original ws network with @xmath53  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we next consider the neton - level density @xmath54 , which is given by  @xcite @xmath55 in one dimension . </S>",
    "<S> using the mathematical identity @xmath56 with @xmath57 , we write eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : density1d ] ) in the form @xmath58 in the regular network ( @xmath12 ) , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gw ] ) , together with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rsmall ] ) , gives the density @xmath54 independent of @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath59 , in the low - frequency limit @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> -0.8 cm    in the presence of shortcuts , we use the box counting method to compute the neton - level density from the obtained eigenvalues of the dynamic matrix . the resulting density @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g(w ) ] , which exhibits several characteristic features . first , as already found in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wk](b ) , the density @xmath54 develops a gap @xmath61 below which @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : wc ] shows that the gap @xmath61 , well described by the linear relation @xmath63 for small @xmath3 ( see the inset of fig .  [ fig : wc ] ) , keeps increasing as the rewiring probability @xmath3 is raised and then appears to saturate for @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> such saturation behavior has also been observed in the synchronization phenomena in the ws network  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the emergence of the gap implies that the ws network is very rigid against lattice vibrations at small energies . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , one can not excite netons at sufficiently low energies . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the specific heat of the ws network for @xmath65 , and compare it with that of the local regular network ( @xmath12 ) in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : wscv ] . as expected , the presence of a finite gap in the neton - level density gives rise to exponentially small specific heat at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the local regular network , where thermal excitations of phonons are gapless and accordingly , the specific heat is described by the well - known debye form with power - law dependence on the temperature , i.e. , @xmath66 in one dimension .    the second interesting feature observed in the neton - level density in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : g(w ) ] is the emergence of sharp peaks at small @xmath3 . figure  [ fig : vanhove](a ) shows in detail the density @xmath54 at @xmath67 , displaying three peaks . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a local regular network ( @xmath12 ) ( i.e. , a regular lattice ) has van hove singularities whenever @xmath68 vanishes [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : gw ] ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the local regular network with the second - nearest neighbor interaction @xmath69 , the positions of the van hove singularities are easily obtained : the eigenfrequency @xmath70 given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : w2 ] ) , combined with the condition @xmath71 , leads to two singularities at @xmath72 and @xmath73 ; this allows us to conclude that the first two peaks in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vanhove](a ) are remnants of the van hove singularities present in the local regular network . on the other hand , the third peak at @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> can not be explained in terms of the singularity of the local regular network . in order to probe the origins of the peaks , </S>",
    "<S> we measure how the peak heights change as the rewiring probability @xmath3 is varied and plot the results in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vanhove](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first peak and the second one at @xmath75 and at @xmath76 , respectively , are observed to have heights which decrease with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this again confirms that these two peaks originate from the local regular network , thus becoming weaker as the network loses its local structure . </S>",
    "<S> the height of the third peak , in contrast , is found to grow as @xmath3 is increased , which clearly indicates that the third peak provides a feature generic to the ws network structure .    finally , we examine neton excitations on the ba network  @xcite . in more detail , we first grow the ba network , following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : starting from @xmath6 vertices initially ( at time @xmath77 ) , we attach a vertex with @xmath6 edges at every time step . </S>",
    "<S> once the ba network is built , we then put an atom on each vertex , assuming that the network is embedded in a 1d chain . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency spectrum is obtained in the same way as that of the ws network , with the dynamic matrix still given by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : matrix ] ) and ( [ eq : dij ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> similarly to the ws network , revealed is the emergence of a gap . </S>",
    "<S> as the number @xmath6 becomes larger , the gap grows and the peaks tend to smear out . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting observation in the ba network is the slow decay of the density @xmath54 at large frequencies , which is to be compared with the vanishingly small density at high frequencies found in the ws network . </S>",
    "<S> the log - log plot of the density @xmath54 versus the frequency @xmath15 , displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : batail ] , reveals that the ba network exhibits power - law decay which is well scaled as @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath54 in the ws network shows very rapid decay , which is presumably of the exponential form . </S>",
    "<S> the observed power - law decay of @xmath54 in the ba network implies that netons may be excited with arbitrarily high energies . </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to compare this with the behavior of the adjacency matrix of the ba network  @xcite . although the adjacency matrix @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 , and the dynamic matrix @xmath33 have different diagonal components , both show similar scale - free distributions at large eigenvalues .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the phonon spectra in the monatomic chain where atoms interact with each other through the edges of complex networks . the density of phonon levels in the complex network , i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , neton levels has been found to develop a gap , which indicates that netons may not be excited up to the critical frequency , and accordingly , a finite amount of energy is required to generate lattice vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness of a complex network has also been shown to yield exponentially small specific heat at low temperatures , in contrast to the power - law temperature dependence in the local regular network . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic structure of the ws network has been described by the emergence of a peak in the level density in addition to those originating from the van hove singularities . in the ba network , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the level density has been found to decay algebraically at high frequencies , which suggests excitability of arbitrarily high - energy netons .    </S>",
