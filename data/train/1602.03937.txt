    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) provides a well - established experimental manifestation of a strongly correlated electron system supporting topologically ordered ground states .",
    "when quasi - two - dimensional electrons are placed in a strong perpendicular magnetic field of strength @xmath0 ( tens of teslas ) at very low temperatures ( @xmath1 k ) such that the electron filling factor @xmath2 is a rational fraction ( @xmath3 is the magnetic length and @xmath4 is the two - dimensional electron density ) the kinetic energy is quenched ( macroscopically degenerate landau levels form ) , the low - energy physics is dominated by the electron - electron interaction , and an incompressible topological ordered quantum fluid forms  @xcite .",
    "the experimental phenomena of the fqhe is the observation of a plateau in the hall resistance @xmath5 along with a vanishing of the longitudinal resistance @xmath6 , when @xmath7 is a rational fraction .",
    "the existence of fractionally charged abelian anyonic quasiparticles is experimentally established with the observation of fractional charge combined with an unambiguous theoretical understanding  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is tantalizing and controversial experimental evidence of abelian and non - abelian statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , the observation of fractional braiding statistics and the definitive observation of non - abelian anyon quasiparticles  @xcite remain elusive  the experimental confirmation of either would be a major step towards the construction of a topologically protected quantum computing device  @xcite .",
    "the fqhe requires a quasi - two - dimensional electron system and was first discovered in gaas semiconductor heterostructures and has since been observed in other quasi - two - dimensional systems , one of which is the newly discovered atomically thin two - dimensional system of graphene  @xcite .",
    "the experimental exploration of the fqhe in graphene is still in its relatively early development  @xcite .",
    "graphene is a hexagonal crystal system of carbon atoms with two atoms ( @xmath8 and @xmath0 sites ) per unit cell .",
    "the low - energy hamiltonian , in the continuum limit of a nearest neighbor tight binding model , consists of @xmath9-electrons in two bands ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 valleys ) each with a massless linear spectrum , therefore , each two - dimensional electron has a spin and valley index . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", the linear dirac spectrum gives a cyclotron energy of @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dielectric and @xmath14 m / s is the fermi velocity .",
    "the landau level index @xmath15 has a spacing between consecutive landau levels decreasing as @xmath16 for large @xmath17 ( compared to @xmath18 for electrons in semiconductor heterostructures with @xmath19 with constant landau level spacing ) .    at the simplest level",
    ", one can theoretically study the fqhe with a hamiltonian consisting of only the coulomb interaction between electrons in the @xmath17th landau level .",
    "however , it is important to take into account realistic physics when they may produce qualitatively different effects compared to the minimal model of the coulomb hamiltonian alone . to leading order ,",
    "the most important realistic effects in graphene are landau level mixing and disorder .",
    "( note that graphene is atomically thin , so unlike the fqhe in semiconductor heterostructure , one does not need to consider the width of the quasi - two - dimensional system . )",
    "landau level mixing is the tendency of electron / hole excitations in unoccupied / occupied landau levels outside the @xmath17th level and can be parameterized by the ratio @xmath20 of the coulomb interaction strength to the landau level spacing : @xmath21 and , interestingly , it is independent of the magnetic field strength . if @xmath22 then landau level mixing can be safely ignored when constructing an effective theoretical model .",
    "experimental samples where the fqhe in graphene has been observed ( both suspended graphene and graphene on a boron nitride substrate  @xcite ) , however , have a landau level mixing parameter of @xmath23 and landau level mixing can never be safely ignored in graphene .",
    "therefore , it is important to at least study a well - defined model where the effects of landau level mixing can be understood in a controlled approximation that is exact in some limit ( in our case as @xmath24 ) .",
    "previous numerical work  @xcite has shown the system to be sensitive to small perturbations to the hamiltonian and only some  @xcite have attempted to take landau level mixing into account . in this work , however , we do not discuss specific results of exact diagonalization or variational monte carlo studies of the fqhe in graphene , rather , we seek to provide a more accurate formalism going forward in which to investigate realistic effects with less chance of significant systematic errors .",
    "a technique commonly used in theoretical studies is to map the two - dimensional plane to the compact sphere ",
    "this geometry has the advantage of being free of boundaries allowing a more straightforward study of bulk properties ( we will discuss the spherical geometry in more detail below ) .",
    "most numerical studies of the fqhe in graphene that have utilized the spherical geometry have formulated the hamiltonian describing the electron - electron interactions in terms of haldane pseudopotentials calculated in the infinite planar geometry . while it is feasible that the use of planar pseudopotentials in spherical geometry calculations may better approximate the thermodynamic limit , when the energy difference between competing fqh states is small , which is apparently the case for the fqhe in graphene , it is important to carefully approach the thermodynamic limit using spherical geometry pseudopotentials .",
    "recent works by balram _ et al_.  @xcite and wjs _",
    "et al_.  @xcite have investigated graphene using the spherical pseudopotentials and have provided a formula for the coulomb matrix elements in the spherical geometry in terms of the usual matrix elements for massive electrons ",
    "this allows one to calculate the graphene spherical pseudopotentials . while the mathematical physics problem of dirac fermions in the presence of a magnetic monopole has received attention ( cf",
    ". refs .   and  )",
    "the recent work  @xcite was justified by appealing to a calculation of the eigenstates by jellal  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we accomplish essentially three things :    \\(i ) one thing we do to provide an alternative derivation ( compared to jellal  @xcite ) of the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies for massless dirac fermions on the haldane sphere  our approach is more in line with the traditional approach used in the fqhe literature and utilizes the cyclotron motion operators discussed previously by greiter  @xcite .",
    "incidentally , we note that our hamiltonian is different from that analyzed previously  @xcite .",
    "the single - electron eigenfunctions @xmath25 and eigenenergies @xmath26 are @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the monopole harmonics used in fqhe studies in the spherical geometry , @xmath30 is the monopole strength at the center of the sphere that produces the radial magnetic field , and @xmath31 is the landau level index .",
    "\\(ii ) the second thing we do is to use the above single - particle eigenstates @xmath25 to calculate the haldane pseudopotentials for the @xmath32 landau level of graphene completely within the spherical geometry and tabulate the values for a number of commonly diagonalized or studied system sizes .",
    "\\(iii ) the third thing we do is formulate an effective landau level mixing hamiltonian entirely within the spherical geometry for use in subsequent studies .",
    "this is possible because we find the single - particle kinetic energy ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this is a crucial ingredient to understand the effect of landau level mixing in graphene for finite - sized spherical systems .",
    "again , we tabulate the three - body pseudopotentials and two - body pseudopotential corrections that characterize the effective interaction for a number of commonly studied finite - sized systems .    in the process of characterizing the finite - sized effective hamiltonian",
    ", we learn a number of important things .",
    "we learn precisely how the pseudopotentials approach the thermodynamic limit , how different the finite - size values are from the values in the thermodynamic limit , and the number of landau levels that need to be kept in the sums over virtual transitions to higher and lower landau levels in order to obtain proper convergence .",
    "this is important because an alternative approach to studying landau level mixing in the fqhe is to exactly diagonalize or implement density - matrix - renormalization - group techniques in an expanded , yet truncated , fock space  @xcite .",
    "however , due to computational limitations , the number of landau levels kept in these sorts of calculations is on the order of five or six .",
    "what we learn here is that the three - body pseudopotentials converge rather quickly with the number of landau levels kept in the sums and usually are nearly converged by five or six landau levels  this is good news for the expanded fock space method of incorporating landau level mixing .",
    "however , the two - body corrections to the bare pseudopotentials commonly require well over ten landau levels to ensure reasonable convergence  this is not very good news for the expanded fock space approach .",
    "it is important in the future to determine the validity and precise parameter regimes where the two alternative methods of including landau level mixing are valid .",
