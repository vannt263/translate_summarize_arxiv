    "in recent years fluctuation diamagnetism and the nernst effect in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors have generated great interest both theoretically   @xcite and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "experiments have found a very large diamagnetic and nernst response in the enigmatic pseudogap phase of the cuprates .",
    "a large diamagnetic signal naturally points towards fluctuating superconductivity as one of the possible origins .",
    "also , the fact that the nernst response is usually very small in typical nonmagnetic metals and a much stronger response is observed in the vortex - liquid regime as is expected in a fluctuating superconductor supports this point of view .",
    "compared to conventional superconductors , the nernst and diamagnetic response have been found to exist over an anomalously large region @xcite in the pseudogap phase , extending to temperatures far above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 ( see however ref .  ) .",
    "this , and other mysterious features of the pseudogap phase@xcite , have lead to an intense debate over whether these responses originate purely from superconducting ( sc ) fluctuations  @xcite or have a significant contribution from quasiparticles and other possible competing orders  @xcite .",
    "another important piece of the debate is related to the fact that the putative boundary @xcite of the large nernst and diamagnetic response regime , the so - called ` onset ' temperature @xmath1 , tracks @xmath2 and follows a dome - shaped curve as a function of doping @xmath3 instead of tracking the pseudogap temperature scale @xmath4 , which monotonically decreases with @xmath3 .",
    "this has been argued as evidence against a pairing origin of the pseudogap , mainly due to the expectation that if the pseudogap arises from pairing then sc fluctuations and associated nernst and diamagnetic responses should persist all the way up to pseudogap temperature  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical works in the past have studied the nernst effect and diamagnetism in the models of sc fluctuations in various parameter regimes .",
    "one of the pertinent issues in this context is the relative importance of amplitude and phase fluctuations of the sc order parameter @xmath5 and the role of vortices in the observed signal .",
    "microscopically , the effect of gaussian fluctuations around the bcs state has been investigated@xcite near @xmath6 and , more recently , over a broad range of temperature and magnetic field @xcite . also , fluctuations beyond that of the bcs paradigm have been studied using a more phenomenological description @xcite .",
    "the thermo - electric response has also been calculated in numerical simulations @xcite capturing fluctuations beyond the gaussian level through a ginzburg - landau functional , modeling overdoped cuprates .",
    "other complementary theoretical works , more relevant for the underdoped region , have utilized a ` phase - only ' description , by studying a two - dimensional ( 2d ) xy model and its variants via various numerical @xcite and analytical methods @xcite .",
    "such a description for underdoped cuprates is based on the phase - fluctuation scenario @xcite , where , unlike in bcs theory , @xmath6 is controlled by the superfluid density @xmath7 rather than the pairing gap scale @xmath8 . as a result , superconductivity gets destroyed at @xmath6 by strong phase fluctuations in the underdoped regime , whereas local pairing survives up to a much higher temperature scale @xmath9 .",
    "the importance of phase fluctuations has also been emphasized in the analysis of diamagnetism @xcite and the nernst effect @xcite by ong and co - workers , but this interpretation of the nernst data has been challenged recently @xcite .",
    "however , there is considerable independent evidence in underdoped cuprates that the sc order is destroyed by phase - disordering @xcite rather than a gap collapse .",
    "this is also what one expects in a doped mott insulator @xcite .",
    "studies of fluctuation diamagnetism @xcite based on the phase - fluctuation scenario have mostly ignored the effect of amplitude fluctuations and thus are constrained to describe only the extreme underdoped part of the cuprate phase diagram .",
    "a complete theoretical calculation of either diamagnetism or the nernst effect based on a single model of sc fluctuations over the entire range of experimentally realized doping has so far not been performed .    in this work",
    ", we aim to address the above issue and calculate the fluctuation diamagnetism ( an equilibrium property , unlike the nernst effect which is a consequence of nonequilibrium transport ) based on a recently proposed phenomenological model of high-@xmath0 superconductors @xcite .",
    "this model is of the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) type with doping and temperature dependent coefficients and is motivated by a large amount of spectroscopic data obtained from the cuprates such as arpes@xcite , stm @xcite as well as thermodynamic and transport measurements@xcite .",
    "the starting point of our description is the premise that to understand several aspects of their phenomenology , the free energy of cuprate superconductors can be expressed solely as a functional of the complex pair amplitude ( e.g.  for investigating the role of pairing fluctuations in diamagnetic response ) , other degrees of freedom e.g. electrons , cdw being not explicit .",
    "there are two main inputs to our phenomenological theory@xcite ",
    "( i ) a pairing temperature scale @xmath4 below which local pairing amplitude becomes substantial and ( ii ) the superfluid density @xmath10 , that linearly increases with doping for small x , as implied by well - known uemura correlation @xcite . as shown in the schematic phase diagram for our model in fig .",
    "[ fig.phasediagram ] , the temperature scale @xmath4 mimics the doping dependence of the pseudogap temperature scale @xcite and is much larger than @xmath7 in the underdoped regime .",
    "the model effectively interpolates between a phase - only description in the extreme underdoped side to a conventional ginzburg - landau model in the overdoped region and also accesses the intermediate regime around optimal doping .",
    "the model is also able to produce several other experimentally observed properties of the cuprates , such as the doping dependence of the phase stiffness or @xmath11 and the fluctuation specific heat @xcite and when coupled to nodal quasiparticles can produce fermi arcs with details that agree well with experiments @xcite .",
    "a summary of the model and the parameters occurring in it is provided in appendix a.    we note that there is considerable evidence for other ordering tendencies in the cuprates , e.g. , nematic@xcite , stripes@xcite , checkerboard@xcite , circulating current @xcite and charge density wave ( cdw ) @xcite . the strength and significance of each varies with the material , doping and temperature .",
    "recently detection of short - range cdw order by x - ray @xcite and nmr measurements @xcite in the pseudogap and superconducting states of underdoped cuprates has attracted a lot of attention . in zero magnetic field , short - range cdw order competes with superconductivity and seems to become long - ranged only at high fields , presumably giving rise to fermi surface reconstruction , as suggested by quantum oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "motivated by these findings a phenomenological nonlinear sigma model ( nlsm ) , in terms of a coupled sc and cdw order parameter has been proposed recently  @xcite .",
    "subsequent work  @xcite has pointed out that the observed magnetization and nernst effect could arise primarily from the vortex physics that results after the charge ordering degrees of freedom have been integrated out .",
    "further , it also attributes the rise of the x - ray structure factor , seen in experiments , to a proliferation of vortices .",
    "our theory is similar in spirit to these ideas and the parameters in our gl - like free energy functional can be thought to be renormalized values of those that occur in a theory with a larger order parameter space after the other orders have been integrated out .    in this work",
    "we obtain the magnetization by performing classical monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations on the gl - like model described above .",
    "calculations of the nernst effect will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as our model effectively reduces to a phase - only description on the underdoped side for the temperature range @xmath12 , vortices play a major role in determining the nernst and diamagnetic responses in this regime .",
    "the vortex core energy is one of the important quantities in this regard ; we calculate its doping dependence from our model and show that it is consistent with the available estimates  @xcite for underdoped cuprates .",
    "our main results could be summarized as follows ",
    "we calculate the diamagnetic response over the entire doping - temperature phase diagram for a range of magnetic fields and show that our results match well with the available experiments .",
    "we obtain a region of enhanced fluctuation diamagnetism in the pseudogap phase extending far above the transition temperature @xmath6 and show that the boundary of the region , namely the onset temperature @xmath13 , follows a dome shaped curve tracking @xmath6 as a function of doping ( fig .",
    "[ fig.phasediagram ] ) .     in the hole doping @xmath3 and temperature @xmath14 plane .",
    "the local pairing temperature scale @xmath4 , ( solid black line ) is an input to our phenomenological model [ eq .  ] and it mimics the experimental pseudogap temperature scale .",
    "the model reproduces a dome - shaped superconducting region ( shaded in pink ) .",
    "the region of enhanced fluctuation diamagnetism ( shaded in blue ) in the pseudogap phase and corresponding onset temperature @xmath1 are shown .",
    "the two arcs shown by dotted lines denote regions where quantum fluctuation effects , as well as other low - energy degrees of freedom , such as electronic and spin plus their coupling with pair degrees of freedom , need to be explicitly included in the free energy functional.,height=226 ]    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec.conc ] . in appendix [ app.parameters ] , we also describe in detail the various features of the model and parameters in it along with a summary of how the cuprate dome can be obtained from it . a discussion of the effects of quantum phase fluctuations and other competing orders on the superconducting dome is given in appendix [ app.tcquantum ] .",
    "in our model , the highly anisotropic cuprate superconductor is modeled as a weakly coupled stack of @xmath15 planes . as a first approximation",
    ", we ignore the interplane coupling .",
    "the free energy functional  @xcite @xmath16 is defined on the @xmath17 planes of the superconductor .",
    "the model describes the free energy as a functional in which the effects of the fluctuations of the order parameter phase and magnitude are coupled , and the relative importance of the latter increases with hole doping @xmath3 .",
    "the pairing field @xmath18 , with amplitude @xmath19 and phase @xmath20 , is defined on the sites @xmath21 of a square lattice .",
    "microscopically , the field @xmath22 is expected to be related to the complex spin - singlet pairing amplitude defined on the cu - o - cu bonds @xcite . the functional @xmath23 is defined as    [ eq.functional ] @xmath24    where @xmath25 represents pairs of nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the details of the choice of parameters for a specific cuprate material , e.g.  bi2212 , that we study here , are discussed in appendix [ app.parameters ] .",
    "we note that the two main inputs from cuprate phenomenology are the doping and temperature dependence of the parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is assumed a doping independent positive number .",
    "the effect of a magnetic field is incorporated in our model through a bond flux @xmath29 , which modifies @xmath30 to @xmath31 in @xmath32 [ eq . ] . assuming extreme type - ii ( infinite penetration depth ) limit as appropriate for the cuprate superconductors , the magnetic field @xmath33 is given by the condition @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a sum over a plaquette of the lattice and @xmath36 is the magnetic flux per plaquette in units of the universal flux quantum @xmath37 . as mentioned earlier",
    "the lattice constant @xmath38 introduces a field scale @xmath39 , which , in principle , can be deduced by comparing our results with experimental data .",
    "here we study the phase diagram as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "introducing a magnetic field gives rise to a diamagnetic moment @xmath41 in the system .",
    "the principal goal of our calculation is to find @xmath41 as a function of @xmath14 , @xmath33 and @xmath3 . to achieve this",
    ", we first define the diamagnetic current along a bond between nearest neighbour sites @xmath21 and @xmath42 as @xmath43 @xmath41 is then obtained from @xmath44 by an appropriate integration . to this end",
    "we perform our calculations in a cylindrical geometry with periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath3 and zero current conditions along the @xmath45 direction .",
    "the magnetic field is radially outwards which yields a magnetization @xmath41 along the same direction .",
    "we work in the landau gauge where the @xmath29 are non - zero only for @xmath25 along the @xmath45 direction and @xmath46 is only along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "we integrate the current along the @xmath45 direction from the edge of the sample to the middle to obtain @xmath47 .",
    "we use metropolis sampling for the mc simulations .",
    "we have verified that our results are independent of gauge choice and also boundary conditions .",
    "we would like to emphasize that there is no meissner effect in our system since it is strictly two dimensional .",
    "thus , the expression for the current we use is different from the standard london expression @xmath48 , which holds only for the so - called coulomb gauge ( @xmath49 ) and where the complex superconducting order parameter is spatially uniform . here , we are concerned with diamagnetism at field scales for real materials much higher than @xmath50 , where the meissner effect sets in . in our numerical grid , the direction of the current is always in the periodic direction for all choice of gauges as can be seen from the gauge invariance of the expression for the current eq .. gauge invariance here is invariance under the simulatenous transformations @xmath51 and @xmath52 for an arbitrary function @xmath53 of @xmath54 .",
    "note that such a transformation is not allowed if the @xmath55 is spatially uniform ( a necessary condition for the london expression for the current ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we have verified the gauge invariance of our results by choosing different gauges for @xmath56 in our simulation .",
    "we perform our simulations using the standard metropolis monte - carlo scheme . for obtaining the superfluid density @xmath7",
    ", we perform the simulations on a square lattice of size 100@xmath57100 with periodic boundary conditions along both directions . at each value of doping @xmath3 we let the system equilibrate for about @xmath58 mc steps per site and then average over @xmath59 mc steps . as mentioned in section [ sec.superconductingtc ] we determine the actual transition temperature @xmath6 accurately by employing the standard finite - size scaling analysis  @xcite of kt transition for small system sizes .    to calculate the magnetization we perform our simulations on a cylindrical grid with periodic boundary conditions in one direction and zero current conditions along the other .",
    "the magnetic flux is in the the radial direction of the cylinder with uniform flux per plaquette .",
    "the allowed values of flux are in the radial direction and determined by the condition of zero flux in the axial direction .",
    "the current is in the azimuthal direction ( in the direction in which we have periodic boundary conditions ) , is maximum at the edges and falls to zero and changes direction at the centre . as a consistency check ,",
    "we calculate the magnetization at zero , @xmath60 and @xmath61 flux / plaquette and find it to be zero as it should be . for each @xmath62 , we perform @xmath63 mc steps per site for equilibration and a further @xmath64 steps for thermal averaging for our largest system size .",
    "even though we perform the simulation for a single 2d layer we assume that the actual 3d system is a collection of 2d layers with a negligible josephson coupling between them .",
    "thus , the only possible interaction between the pancake vortices is electromagnetic in nature .",
    "this type of interaction has been shown to not change the bkt universality class of the superfluid transition and gives a very small non - universal correction to the superfluid density jump  @xcite .",
    "we thus also ignore the electromagnetic interaction among the vortices in different layers .",
    "the conversion from 2d magnetization to 3d magnetization involves division by an appropriate length along the @xmath65 axis . for bi2212 ,",
    "the lattice spacing along the @xmath65 axis is 3.07 nm and the appropriate length is half this value @xmath66 nm  @xcite .",
    "the dimensionless temperature is converted into kelvin by multiplying with @xmath67 which is suitably chosen for bi2212 ( see appendix [ app.parameters ] ) .",
    "in this section we report our results for fluctuation diamagnetism . based on these ,",
    "we analyse the superconducting fluctuation regime in the pseudogap phase .",
    "we also discuss the role of vortex core - energy in our model .",
    "we have obtained the values of magnetization as a function of temperature , doping and field in our model .",
    "the overall features of diamagnetism over the phase diagram are summarized in fig.[fig : magcolor ] through color map plots of the strength of diamagnetic signal as a function of @xmath14 and @xmath33 for three different values of doping from underdoped to overdoped .",
    "having already fixed the parameters of our model , we convert the magnetization to physical units as mentioned above .",
    "the magnetic field also could be converted to tesla by a suitable choice of the field scale @xmath68 or equivalently the coarse - graining length @xmath38 in our model",
    ". we can achieve good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data of li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite with magnetization values at worst being within a factor of 2 with the measured values by choosing @xmath69 t , i.e. @xmath70 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : magvsf ] shows the magnetization as a function of magnetic field for @xmath71 and @xmath72 at different temperatures .",
    "the main qualitative observation that one can immediately make is that as the field decreases the magnetization appears to go to zero for temperatures @xmath73 and to diverge for @xmath74 .",
    "this is consistent with the predictions of a renormalization group calculation in the vicinity of the bkt transition  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we do not have a meissner effect in our calculations .",
    "the full meissner effect diamagnetic signal for real materials is much larger than the values of magnetization that we obtain here . for the range of magnetic fields",
    "we apply , it is of the order of @xmath63 a / m per tesla . since this is several orders of magnitude larger than the fluctuation diamagnetic response we calculate ( about 1500 a / m at its largest ) , we do not show it in the plots with the experimental data .",
    "our assumption of working with a strictly two dimensional system is valid only for fields substantially larger than @xmath50 , which holds for the specific range of fields for which we perform our calculations .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : magvst ] , we show plots of the magnetization as a function of temperature for two different values of doping .",
    "it is evident that there is a significant diamagnetic signal persisting much above @xmath6 as seen in experiments  @xcite .",
    "to clearly demonstrate this point , we have plotted the magnetization above in the @xmath3-@xmath14 plane for @xmath76 for two values of magnetic field as in fig .",
    "[ fig : magxt ] .",
    "the diamagnetic signal is found to extend till a temperature which is weakly dependent on the field and approximately scales as @xmath77 for the particular choice of parameters here .",
    "experimentally , both the nernst effect  @xcite and diamagnetism  @xcite have been seen to track the superconducting dome .",
    "the persistence of the nernst and diamagnetism signal over a dome - shaped region above @xmath6 , instead of the entire pseudogap state till @xmath4 , has been argued as evidence against the pairing origin of the pseudogap line .",
    "this is due to the expectation that if the pseudogap line is related to pairing then superconducting fluctuations should continue till @xmath78 .",
    "however , on the basis of our results , we can argue that this expectation is not justified since pairing fluctuations identifiable as superconducting fluctuations , e.g.  those detected through nernst effect or diamagnetism , are mainly controlled by @xmath7 or the @xmath6 scale .",
    "the gl - like model we study has the pseudogap temperature @xmath4 explicitly set as the local pairing scale by construction , but , even then , the diamagnetic signal tracks the superconducting @xmath6 that is governed by the superfluid density rather than the pairing scale @xmath78 on the underdoped side .",
    "plane for two different values of @xmath79 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that diamagnetic signal follows the superconducting dome .",
    "the magnetization at these fields is obtained by interpolating between our numerical data points for fixed values of fields.,width=11,height=302 ]    the putative boundary of the region of substantial fluctuation diamagnetism can be defined as the onset temperature @xmath80 . experimentally the onset temperature is inferred from both nernst  @xcite effect and diamagnetism  @xcite measurements . in the former case @xmath75",
    "is defined as the temperature at which the measured nernst signal starts deviating from the high - temperature background quasiparticle contribution and , in the latter case , as the temperature where the magnetization starts decreasing rapidly away from a weakly @xmath14-dependent paramagnetic van vleck signal . in our model @xmath75",
    "can be deduced by defining , albeit in an ad hoc manner , a threshold value of the magnetization .",
    "however , more concretely , a good qualitative measure of the onset temperature can be obtained from our model by estimating the transition temperature @xmath81 via a single - site mean - field approximation  @xcite .",
    "@xmath82 gives a measure of the temperature scale corresponding to the local superfluid density and is found to be approximately @xmath83 .",
    "fluctuation effects destroy the global phase coherence and reduce the mean - field transition temperature from @xmath81 to the actual transition temperature @xmath6 .",
    "however , one would expect a manifestation of substantial sc fluctuations , such as fluctuation diamagnetism , to persist over a temperature range @xmath84 .",
    "these considerations lead to the schematic phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig.phasediagram ] .",
    "the suppression of @xmath2 relative to @xmath4 is an indicator of the strength of superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the fact that @xmath2 is dome shaped while @xmath4 decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath3 shows that fluctuations get weaker with increasing doping .",
    "the two extremes of the strength of fluctuations are represented by the phase - only @xmath85 model ( ` strong fluctuations ' ) and the gaussian model ( ` weak fluctuations ' ) .",
    "the magnetization in the former model has been calculated and found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data  @xcite .",
    "our data for extreme underdoped samples are in agreement with the results of these calculations as shown in fig  [ fig.mag_2dud ] .",
    "the strong fluctuation limit corresponds to the fluctuations essentially in the phase @xmath86 of the superconducting order parameter with the amplitude @xmath55 being frozen .",
    "as @xmath3 increases , amplitude fluctuations start becoming more significant even as the overall strength of fluctuations decreases till one arrives at regime where the fluctuations are gaussian and can not be divided into contributions from amplitude and phase in any meaningful sense . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : magvsf ] , our calculations show that the qualitative behavior obtained from the @xmath85 model persists even when amplitude fluctuations develop changing only the overall magnitude of the magnetization",

    "<S> we analyse the pairing fluctuations above the superconducting transition temperature in the cuprates , ranging from the strong phase fluctuation dominated underdoped limit to the more conventional amplitude fluctuation dominated overdoped regime . we show that a model where the pairing scale increases and the superfluid density decreases with underdoping produces features of the observed magnetization in the pseudogap region , in good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement with the experimental data . in particular , we explicitly show that even when the pseudogap has a pairing origin the magnetization actually tracks the superconducting dome instead of the pseudogap temperature , as seen in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the doping dependence of the ` onset ' temperature for fluctuation diamagnetism and comment on the role of vortex core - energy in our model . </S>"
