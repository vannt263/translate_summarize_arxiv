    "an intense branch of astroparticle physics is the study of high - energy cosmic rays to reveal their origin , as well as their acceleration and propagation mechanisms @xcite . at energies exceeding @xmath0  ev cosmic rays",
    "are usually studied by indirect measurements  the investigation of extensive air showers initiated by cosmic particles in the atmosphere .",
    "different techniques are applied , like the measurements of particle densities and energies at ground level , or the observation of and fluorescence light .",
    "an alternative technique has been recently revitalized  the detection of radio emission ( at tens of mhz ) from extensive air showers at energies exceeding @xmath1  ev .",
    "radio emission from air showers was experimentally discovered in 1965 at a frequency of 44 mhz @xcite .",
    "the early activities in the 1960s and 1970s are summarized in . only recently , fast analog - to - digital converters and modern computer technology made a clear detection of radio emission from air showers possible .",
    "lopes , a lofar prototype station had shown that radio emission from air showers can be detected even in an environment with relatively strong radio frequency interference ( rfi ) @xcite .",
    "further investigations of the radio emission followed with lopes @xcite and the codalema experiment @xcite , paving the way for this new detection technique @xcite .",
    "most likely , the dominant emission mechanism of the radio waves in the atmosphere is synchrotron radiation due to the deflection of charged particles in the earth magnetic field ( geosynchrotron radiation ) @xcite . in the frequency range of interest ( @xmath2  mhz ) the wavelength of the radiation is large compared to the size of the emission region : the typical thickness of the shower disc is about 1 to 2  m only .",
    "thus , coherent emission is expected , which yields relatively strong signals ( of the order of a few @xmath3v / m mhz ) at ground level .",
    "goal of the present activities is to further push the development of radio detection to become a new , independent way to measure the properties of air showers .",
    "ultimate goal is to derive information about the primary , shower - inducing particle from the measurements , such as the energy and mass of the particle as well as the particle direction and point of incidence .",
    "an advantage of radio detection , e.g.  with respect to the fluorescence technique , is that showers can be observed with almost 100% duty cycle .",
    "the _ arrival direction _ can be inferred from the arrival time of the wavefront at the antennas .",
    "the measured radio signal at a certain distance from the shower axis is a good estimator for the number of particles at shower maximum , being almost independent of the primary particle type @xcite .",
    "this can be used to determine the shower _ energy_. the curvature of the shower front has been investigated @xcite .",
    "it could be shown that the radius of curvature measured at ground level is related to the distance to the shower maximum .",
    "the depth of the shower maximum in the atmosphere is an important observable to determine the mass of the primary particle .",
    "the study indicates a resolution of from radio observations of order of @xmath4  2 , i.e.  comparable to the accuracy of present fluorescence detectors .",
    "the lopes experiment registers radio signals in the frequency range from 40 to 80  mhz @xcite . in this band are few strong man made radio transmitters only , the emission from air showers is still strong ( it decreases with frequency ) , and background emission from the galactic plane is still low . an active short dipole has been chosen as antenna . an inverted v - shaped dipole is positioned about 1/4 of the shortest wavelength above an aluminum ground plate . in this way a broad directional beam pattern is obtained .",
    "lopes comprises 30 antennas @xcite located on site of the kascade - grande experiment @xcite .",
    "the lopes data acquisition is triggered by large air showers registered with kascade - grande .",
    "the latter measures the showers simultaneously to lopes and delivers precise information on the shower parameters , such as shower energy as well as position and inclination of the shower axis .",
    "the codalema experiment is set up at the nancay radio observatory @xcite . in the first phase six",
    "conic logarithmic periodic antennas of the decametric array have been used .",
    "the present set - up comprises new antennas , developed to optimize simplicity , costs , and performance @xcite .",
    "the broadband antennas ( 100  khz",
    " 220  mhz ) are based on a fat active dipole concept .",
    "they are simple dipoles ( @xmath5  m long ) placed 1  m above ground .",
    "21 dipoles are oriented in east - west polarization direction and three dipoles in north - south direction .",
    "the set - up is completed by 17 plastic scintillation counters to measure the properties of air showers .",
    "the low frequency array ( lofar ) is a new digital radio observatory , presently under construction @xcite .",
    "an objective of lofar is the detection of radio emission from particle cascades , originating from extremely high - energy particles from outer space .",
    "two main lines of research are followed : ( i ) the measurement of radio emission from extensive air showers , generated by interactions of high - energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere @xcite and ( ii ) the detection of radio emission of particle cascades in the moon , originating from ultra high - energy neutrinos and cosmic rays interacting with the lunar surface @xcite .    more than 40 stations with fields of relatively simple antennas will work together as digital radio interferometer .",
    "the antenna fields are distributed over several countries in europe with a dense core in the netherlands .",
    "the latter will have at least 18 stations in an area measuring roughly @xmath6  km@xmath7 .",
    "each station will comprise 96 low band antennas , simple inverted v - shaped dipoles ( like the lopes antennas ) , operating in the frequency range from 30 to 80  mhz .",
    "each antenna will have a dipole oriented in north - south and east - west directions , respectively .",
    "in addition , fields of high - band antennas will cover the frequency range from 110 to 240  mhz . for air shower observations the signals from the low band antennas are digitized and stored in a ring buffer ( transient buffer board , tbb ) .",
    "for valid triggers the data are send to a central processing facility , based on an ibm blue gene supercomputer .",
    "first data from lofar are expected in early 2010 .",
    "a small air shower array will be installed in the lofar core .",
    "it comprises 20 scintillator counters , each with an area of about 1  m@xmath7 , the detectors have been used previously in the kascade experiment @xcite .",
    "the array will provide basic air shower information .",
    "it may also serve as trigger for the radio antennas .",
    "radio emission from air showers at the pierre auger observatory will be measured with the auger engineering radio array ( aera ) @xcite .",
    "aera is co - located with the infill array of the auger observatory and in the field of view of the high - altitude fluorescence telescopes ( heat ) @xcite .",
    "this unique set - up will allow to register air showers simultaneously with three independent detection methods : radio waves , fluorescence light , and particle detection in water detectors .",
    "aera will comprise about 150 antennas located on an area of about 20  km@xmath7 and is designed to cover the energy range from @xmath8 to @xmath9  ev . during the first phase ( spring 2010 ) 24 logarithmic periodic dipole antennas will be deployed and put into operation .    presently , different antenna designs are tested and optimized at the auger site . among them are logarithmic periodic dipole antennas @xcite and simple dipoles , as in the codalema experiment @xcite .",
    "a ring antenna design and fpga - based hardware for a self trigger algorithm are developed within and at the auger site @xcite .",
    "the antenna gain pattern is typically obtained from numerical calculations .",
    "two methods are available for the absolute calibration of the electronics .",
    "( i ) in lopes all antennas , including the complete analog electronics chain , have been individually calibrated with a reference radio source @xcite .",
    "( ii ) an independent way is to use the galactic radio background as calibration source .",
    "the expected strength of the galactic radio signal can be calculated as function of siderial time as well as day of the year and can be used as reference .",
    "this technique is presently explored with aera @xcite .",
    "the measured radio signal as function of siderial time is depicted in .",
    "the colors represent measurements at different days of the year .",
    "the siderial variations are clearly visible , illustrating the good sensitivity of the system .",
    "the properties of the showers registered by lopes are simultaneously measured by the kascade - grande air shower experiment .",
    "an empirical relation has been found to express the expected east - west component of the field strength at a distance @xmath10 from the shower axis as a function of shower parameters @xcite @xmath11 \\cos \\theta   %    \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\\\",
    "\\exp\\left(\\frac{-r}{(236\\pm81)~{\\rm m}}\\right ) \\\\       \\left(\\frac{e_0}{10^{17}~{\\rm ev}}\\right)^{(0.95\\pm0.04 ) }       \\left[\\frac{\\mu{\\rm v}}{\\rm m~mhz}\\right ] . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath12 is the angle between the shower axis and the direction of the earth magnetic field ( geomagnetic angle ) , @xmath13 the zenith angle of the shower , and @xmath14 the energy of the shower inducing primary particle .",
    "it is interesting to note the absolute values of some parameters : the exponential fall - off has a characteristic length of about 240  m , much larger than the classical molire radius of electrons in air ( @xmath15  m ) .",
    "this indicates that the lateral distribution of the radio component is flatter as compared to the electromagnetic component , an important fact to build large - scale radio arrays with an economic antenna density .",
    "the measured radio signal is almost directly proportional to the shower energy ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "such a behavior is expected for a coherent emission of the radio waves in the air showers .",
    "this calibration of the measured radio signal is a first important step towards the application of the radio detection as independent method to register extensive air showers .",
    "recently , the lateral distribution of the measured radio signals has been investigated in more detail with lopes @xcite .",
    "it is found that some air showers exhibit a relatively flat lateral distribution .",
    "most likely , such events are registered at a small distance to the shower axis for showers with large zenith angles .",
    "also the codalema group has parameterized the expected radio signals as function of shower parameters @xcite : @xmath17   \\nonumber .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the parameters @xmath18 the frequency interval , energy @xmath14 and zenith angle @xmath13 of the shower , @xmath19 the direction of the shower axis , @xmath20 the earth magnetic field , @xmath10 the distance to the shower axis , and @xmath21 an empirical function . and @xmath20 in is @xmath12 in . the @xmath12 dependence in and is @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . in the interval",
    "@xmath24 $ ] , both expressions yield similar values , which are compatible with the measurements , given the present accuracy of the data . ]",
    "the frequency spectra in air showers have been investigated with both , the lopes @xcite and codalema @xcite experiments , yielding similar results . due to the relative small frequency range covered ( @xmath25  mhz )",
    "it can not be decided yet whether the data are described better by a power law or an exponential function .",
    "the investigation of the polarization properties and of asymmetries in the arrival direction is the key to confirm the geosynchrotron mechanism and is currently the hottest topic discussed by codalema and lopes .",
    "the field strength produced near the motion axis of the particle is expected to be approximately proportional to @xmath26 and the radiation is expected to be linearly polarized @xcite . the e - w and n - s polarization components",
    "are obtained by the projection of the @xmath27 vector on the corresponding axis .",
    "strong radio signals are expected from showers with arrival directions being about perpendicular to the magnetic field in the respective polarization direction .    since the earth magnetic field",
    "is inclined we expect an asymmetry in the observed signal strength on the sky .",
    "sky maps of the e - w component as measured by the different experiments are shown in ( ) @xcite , ( ) @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the color code in represents the measured field strengths .",
    "the boxes indicate the directions of the events with the strongest signals .",
    "lopes and codalema clearly see more strong events from the north , while more strong events are registered from the south in the southern hemisphere .",
    "a similar effect is observed for the n - s component . in this case ,",
    "strong events arrive from the east and the west @xcite , see ( ) .",
    "the ratio of the measured field strength in n - s to e - w polarization directions as measured by lopes is depicted as function of azimuth ( ) and geomagnetic angle ( ) in @xcite .",
    "mean values and the spread of the distributions are shown . a correlation between the plotted quantities",
    "can be recognized .",
    "the ratio of the north - south divided by the east - west component of the vector of the measured showers exhibits the same behavior as a function of the azimuth angle and geomagnetic angle .",
    "in addition , the codalema group investigated the polarity of the fields measured at ground @xcite . also in this observable clear asymmetries are measured .",
    "showers with a positive electric field arrive mainly from the north and the east , while showers which induce a negative field preferably come from southern and western directions .",
    "simulations of the radio emission by the codalema group show the same behavior as the measured data for both polarization directions , for the arrival direction of the showers as well as for the polarity @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements and simulations conducted at various sites strongly support an emission process in air showers being proportional to @xmath28 and they support geosynchrotron radiation as dominant process .",
    "during thunderstorms there are strong ( static ) electric fields in the atmosphere which severely influence the radio emission of air showers .",
    "the study of radio emission during thunderstorms has a two - fold goal : ( i ) the study of the thunderstorms itself and ( ii ) the ( early ) detection of thunderstorm conditions to prevent false air shower reconstruction during thunderstorms .    as an example",
    ", a thunderstorm observed at the auger observatory is shown in @xcite .",
    "it can be recognized how the thunderstorm moves on the sky as function of time .",
    "quantitative investigations of the radio signals during thunderstorms have been conducted with lopes data @xcite .",
    "the electric fields in the atmosphere yield to an acceleration of charged particles , which in turn yields to an amplification of the radio emission from air showers during thunder storm conditions .",
    "the investigations of radio signals from air showers with lopes and codalema are the basis for the application of these technique in large - scale experiments .",
    "the next step is to utilize the radio detection technique in large arrays , comprising several hundreds of antennas .",
    "the radio detection of air showers is a fast growing sub - discipline in astroparticle physics . with the new experiments starting operation ,",
    "exciting results are expected in the next few years .",
    "i would like to thank the conference organizers for their invitation to give this review in the inspiring environment of lago di como and the villa olmo .",
    "i m thankful to my colleagues from lopes , lofar , and the pierre auger observatory for fruitful discussions ."
