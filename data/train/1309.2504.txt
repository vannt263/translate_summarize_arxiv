    "for the last few years the concept of topological insulators has attracted great attention to a study of massless surface ( or edge ) dirac fermions ( dfs ) in crystals .",
    "these excitations can be realized in semiconductor structures of two types : 1 ) at a flat surface of the 3d topological insulators ( tis ) , like @xmath3 , @xmath4@xcite or at an edge of the 2d tis in @xmath5 quantum wells ; 2 ) at a flat surface of narrow - gap semiconductors@xcite , like bismuth , bismuth - based solid alloys , lead chalcogenides . in a continuous model",
    "both systems are described by multicomponent envelope functions .",
    "however , it is assumed that the surface states ( sss ) in the two types of systems arise due to different reasons .",
    "emergence of the sss in the tis is caused by changing of the topological @xmath6 indices across a crystal ",
    "vacuum interface@xcite .",
    "the topological indices are solely defined by the bloch hamiltonian@xcite . because they are robust to moderate perturbations of the bloch hamiltonian and can change only by closing of the gap , the sss are topologically protected . for the systems of the second type ,",
    "the sss arise due to an abrupt cutoff of a crystal potential , as in refs .",
    "[ , ] . in latter case",
    "the topological arguments are not relevant .",
    "these sss are sometimes called the tamm states or the shockley states , or the tamm  schockley states .",
    "3d tis ( @xmath3-type ) are described in terms of the envelope functions by a modified 3d dirac hamiltonian with momentum depending mass term@xcite @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the 3d momentum operator , @xmath10 are the model parameters , @xmath11 is the vector of the pauli matrices , @xmath12 is an identity matrix 2@xmath13 . to derive the surface state spectrum of @xmath14 , one needs to specify boundary conditions ( bcs ) for the envelope functions .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath14 has the second order in the momentum operators , therefore it is required four restrictions for the envelope functions at the surface . since the envelope functions are only a smoothly varying factor of a real wave function , the problem of the proper bcs for them is not trivial .",
    "one of the most widespread and the simplest bcs are the open bcs@xcite .",
    "these bcs guarantee appearing of the sss in the bulk gap and agree with a spectrum of the tight  binding calculations for the ( 111 ) surface@xcite .",
    "however , the issue of correct bcs for other surface termination is poorly studied .    in the systems of the second type ,",
    "the envelope functions of the massive dirac fermions obey the 3d dirac equation with a constant mass term@xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an effective mass , @xmath17 is an effective  speed of light  . in eq .",
    "( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) two - component spinors @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the envelope functions corresponding to the conduction ( c ) and valence ( v ) bands . in this case",
    "we need only two restrictions for components of the spinors at the surface , as the dirac hamiltonian is of the first order in the momentum operators .",
    "one can derive the bc for the spinors from the hermiticity and time - reversal symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian in a region with the surface @xmath20@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an inner normal to the surface @xmath20 , @xmath0 is the real phenomenological parameter , which characterizes both the microscopic surface structure and bulk band structure .    in a halfspace",
    "@xmath23 the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) with the bcs ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) results in appearing of the 2d massless sss with a conical spectrum@xcite(see fig.[fig : semispace_specrtum ] ) @xmath24 where is the sss speed , , is the energy of the dirac point counted from the middle of the bulk gap , here and below an effective chirality @xmath25 are eigenvalues of an operator @xmath26)$ ] .",
    "we will call these states the tamm  dirac ( td ) states .",
    "one can classify the surface properties depending on a sign of the boundary parameter @xmath0 . at @xmath27",
    "the energy of the dirac point @xmath28 is in the bulk gap , fig.[fig : semispace_specrtum]a , that is the spectrum of the td states is similar with the spectrum of the sss of ti . at @xmath2",
    "the td states spectrum is away from the bulk gap , fig.[fig : semispace_specrtum]b .",
    "for the surfaces with @xmath29 , the spectrum of the td states possesses the particle  antiparticle symmetry with @xmath30",
    ". it should be noted , that such a case is the most popular in the theory of tis .",
    "below , we will show that deviation from this symmetry ( @xmath31 ) has important consequences for backscattering between the td states in a quantum wire .",
    "one can try to clarify the physical meaning of the parameter @xmath0 in a model of sharp ",
    "inverse heterocontact@xcite ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the model is described by the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) with abruptly varying mass and work function ( it is not included in ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) ) across the heterocontact .",
    "the surface with of @xmath1 corresponds to an inversion of mass sign on the heterojunction@xcite .",
    "deviation of @xmath0 from unity accounts for particle  antiparticle asymmetry of the interface .",
    "thus , the massless 2d sss arise both at a flat surface of the ti with the hamiltonian ( [ ti_ham ] ) and at a flat surface of crystal , which is described by the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) with the bcs ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath14 ( [ ti_ham ] ) reduces to the dirac hamiltonian in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to correlate results for the sss of the two types of systems .",
    "spin polarization of the td states is , where @xmath33 is the conventional spin operator for the dirac hamiltonian@xcite , @xmath34 . in the case of particle  antiparticle symmetry ( @xmath29 ) , the td states are not spin polarized ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the topological sss at the ( 111 ) surface of @xmath3 has spin polarization .",
    "recently it has been shown , that the dirac point energy and the spin polarization of the topological sss depend on crystallographic orientation of the surface@xcite , as @xmath3 is an anisotropic crystal .",
    "consequently , more appropriate bcs for @xmath14 ( [ ti_ham ] ) , that are differed from the open bcs , can lead to additional dependence of spin polarization and the dirac point energy on the surface orientation .",
    "consider now an effect of a longitudinal magnetic field on the spectrum of the dfs , confined in a quantum wire . from the one hand ,",
    "a diagonalization of @xmath14 ( [ ti_ham ] ) in a quantum wire in the magnetic field is a sophisticated problem . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the problem is not solved . from the other hand ,",
    "the bcs ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) allow to solve the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) and to find analytically a spectrum of the surface dfs in the magnetic field , taking the quantum confinement into account .    in the present paper we study in frames of latter approach properties of the td states in a cylindrical quantum wire allowing two possible classes of surfaces ( i.e. different signs of @xmath0 ) .",
    "recently , aharonov ",
    "bohm magnetoresistance oscillations have been observed in nanowires of @xmath3 and @xmath4@xcite .",
    "period of the oscillations corresponded to passing of the one flux quantum @xmath36 through the nanowire cross section area .",
    "it was suggested that the effect was caused by the topological sss .",
    "spectrum of these sss in the quantum wire consists of 1d surface subbands@xcite and has periodic dependence on a magnetic flux @xmath37 through the wire . due to the berry phase @xmath38 , massless surface subbands emerge at half - integer values of @xmath39 . in refs .",
    "[ , ] a ss conductance along a ti quantum wire was numerically calculated in two models .",
    "first , the conductance was calculated in the model of an effective surface hamiltonian@xcite for different disorder strength and various doping regimes . at the low doping ( when the fermi level is in the vicinity of the dirac point )",
    "the conductance is formed by the perfectly transmitted mode .",
    "it approaches @xmath40 at half - integer values of @xmath39 for every disorder strength , because of suppression of backscattering in this model . at",
    "the high doping the conductance oscillates with @xmath36 period only at weak disorder . at strong disorder oscillations of the magnetoconductance disappear in this regime .",
    "second , in the fu ",
    "mele lattice model@xcite small gap arose in 1d subband spectrum at half - integer values of @xmath39 , due to time - reversal symmetry breaking in the magnetic field .",
    "this results in a deviation of the wire conductance from @xmath40 .    in our paper",
    "we focus on the solution of the 3d dirac equation supplemented by the bcs ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) .",
    "one of goals constitutes in a qualitative comparison between results obtained in frames of ( [ ti_ham ] ) and ( [ dirac_hamiltonian])-([boundary_condition_main ] )",
    "[ , , ] present the results of the ti hamiltonian diagonalization . in sec .",
    "[ section1 ] we calculate the energy spectrum of the dirac fermions , as surface as well as quantum  confined ones , confined in the cylindrical quantum wire . besides , we find conditions , when backscattering of the surface dfs by a scalar potential is suppressed in zero magnetic field . in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we consider influence of the magnetic field on the spectrum of the states in the wire .",
    "it is shown that the massless surface dfs emerge periodically on the magnetic flux through the quantum wire .",
    "finally , we explicitly determine factors that break down suppression of backscattering of the surface massless dfs in the magnetic field and calculate the conductance in this regime .",
    "consider a cylindrical quantum wire with a radius @xmath41 . choose the cylindrical axis",
    "@xmath42 along the wire axis . the envelope functions of dfs @xmath43 obey the 3d dirac equation ( [ dirac_hamiltonian ] ) and satisfy bcs ( [ boundary_condition_main ] ) with constant @xmath0 at the cylindrical surface . from now on we set @xmath44 everywhere , except where it is needed .",
