    "none of the agents knows on what values the other agents have bid until the end of the auction .",

    "each agent performs a search for a single target whose position changes from auction to auction , as it is determined by the bid history of the whole population of agents .",
    "since the cost of each bid is as much as @xmath15 times larger than the natural unit of the bid , the number of bids that can be made by a single agent is limited and allows only a partial exploration of the bid space .",
    "successful agents need to identify good strategies in order to maximize their winning chances and thus limit their risk .",
    "lowest unique bid auctions are just a particular variant of online pay - to - bid auctions , but other types of pay - to - bid auctions are regularly hosted on the web .",
    "for example , in highest unique bid auction the mechanism of lowest unique bid auction is inverted , and the winning bid is determined by the highest value closest to a pre - determined upper bound value . since these auctions still involve a blind search of the winning value , highest unique bid auctions are equivalent to lowest unique bid auctions . indeed ,",
    "in this paper we analyze data taken from both types of auctions . + other online pay - to - bid auctions , however , can be very different from lowest unique bid auctions .",
    "for example , the so - called penny auctions , which have acquired a great popularity in recent years , appear quite similar to but are not . as in the case of lowest unique bid auctions ,",
    "the cost of the fee is at least @xmath15 times larger of the bid increment , and as a consequence , the final value of the winning bid is much lower than the real value of the good up for auction .",
    "however , in penny auctions the value of the winning bid is publicly known and can only grow during the auction ( i.e. , the word `` penny '' is used because , in penny auctions , bid increments are equal to one cent ) . while escalation plays a very important role in penny auctions , in this type of auctions agents do not need to explore the bid space because the value of the winning bid is known .",
    "penny auctions have been the focus of some theoretical and empirical studies  @xcite .",
    "we collected data from three distinct web sites hosting lowest unique bid auctions .",
    "we automatically downloaded and parsed the content of the tables reporting the bid history of closed auctions .",
    "these data sets contain all the information on individual auctions , including the details of each bid : its value , when it was made and who placed it .",
    "these data allow us to keep track of all the movements performed on bid space by a given agent bidding in a specific auction .",
    "we show in figure  2a a typical exploration of the bid space performed by a single agent .",
    "the exploration of the bid space is bursty : consecutive bid values are generally close to each other , but from time to time the agent performs `` long jumps '' in bid space .",
    "we first compute the jump lengths ( fig .",
    "2b ) and estimate their probability distribution function ( fig .",
    "we find a strikingly robust power - law scaling consistent with the exploration of the bid space using a lvy flight search strategy  @xcite .",

    "our discrete model converges to a standard lvy flight only in the continuum limit of space and time  @xcite .",
    "the power - law scaling can be observed both at the level of single agents ( whenever the number of bids is sufficiently large for estimating the distribution ; c.f .",
    "figs .  2c and supporting information ) and globally , by aggregating the length of the jumps made by all agents in all auctions ( figs .  3a and supporting information ) .",
    "the density distribution of the exponents calculated over single agents is peaked around a mean value @xmath16 ( figs .",

    "2d and  2e are in fact calculated by considering different agents bidding in different auctions .",
    "the power - law scaling and its measured exponent are very stable .",
    "exponent estimates do not depend on the direction of the jumps ( figs .",
    "3b and supporting information ) or the level of activity of the agent ( figs .",
    "3c and supporting information ) .",
    "surprisingly , performing lvy flights does not appear to be a learned strategy .",
    "instead it appears to be an intrinsic feature of the mental search process : the jump lengths in the bid space follow the same power - law at any stage of the auction ( figs .",
    "3d and supporting information ) .",
    "our results represent the strongest empirical evidence for the use of lvy flight strategies in the search of scarce resources reported in literature up to now . differently from previous studies where `` two orders of magnitude of scaling can represent a luxury ''  @xcite , here",
    "the power - law decay can be clearly observed even over four orders of magnitude .",
    "it is unlikely , though , that adopting lvy flight strategies is a deliberate choice of the agents , just as it is not likely that animals searching for food consciously follow a lvy flight strategy .",
    "nevertheless , the data demonstrate that the changes in bid value are statistically consistent with a power - law decaying distribution over several orders of magnitude ( see and supporting information )  @xcite .",
    "simple correlation measurements show also that the lengths of consecutive jumps are independent of each other ( see and supporting information ) .",
    "we believe that the power - law is valid over such a broad regime because the space is not strictly physical .",
    "that is , movements of tens of thousands of cents can be performed for the same cost of those of only one cent .",

    "their peculiarity consists in the fact that they are reverse auctions : rather than the bidder with the highest bid ( as in the case of traditional auctions ) , the winner is the person who makes the lub ( see figure  1a in the main text ) .",
    "the rules of a lub auction are very simple . at the beginning of each auction",
    ", the auctioneers put up for auction a good of value @xmath0 .",
    "after the beginning of the auction and for a certain period of time ( in general of order of weeks ) , agents participate to the auction by making bids .",
    "the natural unit of the auction is one hundredth of dollars , euros , etc ( i.e. , the currency depends on the country where the auction is hosted ) . bids may be any amount ( in cents ) between one cent and a maximal bid amount @xmath1 ( generally lower than ten hundreds of cents ) .",
    "sometimes , the value of @xmath1 is not fixed , but the bid space is anyway naturally bounded since none of the agents wants to bid more than @xmath0 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 depends on the auction , but generally its order of magnitude is of thousands of hundreds of cents . making a bid costs a fee @xmath3 ( typically from one hundred to ten hundreds cents ) . after each bid @xmath120",
    ", the agent receives an automatic message , from the web site hosting the auction , saying whether that bid was the winning bid ( i.e. , the bid is the lub ) or not .",
    "the agent is constantly informed about the status of her bids ( i.e. , whether one of them becomes the lub or is not longer the lub ) . however",
    ", each agent knows only what she has bid , without any information on which values the other agents have bid . in general , there is no restriction for the number of bids that the same agent may place .",
    "when the time dedicated to the auction expires , the winner is the agent who made the lub and can therefore purchase the good for the value of her winning bid . if at the close of the auction a single lowest unique bid does not exist , the successful bid becomes the lowest one made by only two agents and the winner is the one who has bid first on such value . in the case in which also a bid made by only two agents",
    "does not exists , then the winning bid becomes the lowest one made by only three agents and so on .",
    "again in these situations , the winner is the agent who has first placed a bid on the winning value . in our data sets",
    "however , we always observe that the winning bid is an unmatched bid .",
    "+ there are several slight variations of this kind of auctions . very often , the end of the auction is not determined by an expiration time , but by a minimum required number of bids , _ a priori _ fixed by the auctioneers . in other variations called highest unique bid ( hub ) auctions ,",
    "the winning bid is the unique one closest to @xmath1 . + independently on the type of auctions , this kind of auctions are particularly profitable for both the auctioneers and the winners of the auctions .",
    "figure  5 of the main text and figure  [ fig : profit ] clearly show that there are only few exceptions in which auctioneers or winners have lost money , but in the majority of the auctions their returns are positive .",
