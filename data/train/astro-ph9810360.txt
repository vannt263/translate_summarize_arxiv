    "abundance anomalies are observed in many different types of star  the photospheres of stars with effective temperatures hotter than @xmath0k may have undergone chemical separation ( michaud 1970 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that this may be explained via the force on atoms by radiation : if this is larger than gravity , then the element will diffuse toward the surface , else it will settle .",
    "the force due to radiation pressure on elements in a star has been discussed at length by e.g. michaud _ et al . _  ( 1976 ) vauclair _ et al . _  ( 1978 ) , aleican & artru ( 1990 ) and gonzalez _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) .",
    "abundance anomalies have been discussed in a variety of chemically peculiar stars eg .",
    "am and fm stars ( charbonneau & michaud 1991 , alecian 1996 ) , @xmath1  bootis stars ( michaud & charland 1986 ) and magnetic ap - bp stars ( alecian & vauclair , 1981 , michaud _ et al . _  1981",
    "when the star is also rotating , the surface abundance anomalies generated by radiation pressure may be destroyed by the action of turbulent motions within the star ( charbonneau 1992 , talon & zahn 1997 ) .",
    "these arise from shear motions created by the meridional motions which arise due to gravity darkening ( see eg .",
    "von zeipel 1924 , tassoul & tassoul 1982 , zahn 1992 )    there is some observational evidence for _ latitudinal _ abundance variations of heavy elements in planetary nebulae ( balick _ et al . _  1994",
    "this is possibly explained by more highly processed material being ejected faster but at later times then the rest of the shell .",
    "however , the observations raise an interesting question : it is possible that there are stars which are chemically inhomogeneous in both radial and latitudinal directions ?    here a non - magnetic mechanism which generates latitudinal abundance variations is suggested and investigated .",
    "it is found that a significant latitudinal radiative acceleration on heavy elements exists in rotating stars due to gravity darkening ( von zeipel 1924 ) , which causes ionic species to diffuse toward the equatorial plane .",
    "competing with this equatorward drift are the meridional circulation currents , and turbulence generated via shear motions .",
    "the aim of this paper is solely to assess whether any latitudinal drift of heavy elements may occur in rotating stars .",
    "the transport of chemicals is discussed in  2 . in ",
    "3 the radiative force due to gravity darkening is calculated and in  4 the drift velocity of metals around an equipotential is derived .",
    "numerical results of the diffusion velocity in stellar envelopes are presented in  5 , and by considering the relevant timescales , ",
    "6 identifies the important regions within a star for diffusion to occur .",
    "a discussion is presented in  7 , and conclusions given in  8 .",
    "the conservation equation for a trace element of concentration @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the diffusivity tensor , @xmath5 is the global motion of the fluid ( in this case the meridional motions generated via the rotation of the star ) , and @xmath6 describes any motion affecting only the contaminant .",
    "the concentration @xmath2 is defined as the number density of ions compared to the number density of protons .",
    "hereafter , the star is assumed to be axisymmetric , so that using a spherical coordinate system , for any @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "also , for rotating stars , the equipotential is not defined by @xmath9constant . therefore the `` horizontal '' direction is taken to be perpendicular to the equipotential , and the `` vertical '' direction to be parallel to equipotential .",
    "following the work of chaboyer & zahn ( 1992 ) and zahn ( 1992 ) , charbonneau ( 1992 ) examined the effect of anisotropic turbulent diffusion on the distribution of @xmath10 ( zahn 1975 , tassoul & tassoul 1983 , zahn 1987 ) , and found that if the horizontal reynold number is @xmath11 then the equation above loses its bi - dimensional behaviour , and becomes one dimensional ie .",
    "@xmath12 . essentially the horizontal turbulence becomes vigorous enough that it may redistribute the concentration of the trace element faster than meridional motions can generate an anisotropy .",
    "this also makes the angular momentum independent of @xmath13 and gives rise to `` shellular '' rotation of the star ( zahn 1992 ) .    in the current study , however , the velocity field @xmath6 may be non - zero due to the meridional forces on trace elements arising from the anisotropy of the radiation flux ( see  2 ) . to assess its likely effect in the presence of bulk meridional motions and diffusion ,",
    "the ratio of the ( turbulent ) diffusive term to the radiation driven advective term across an equipotential @xmath14 in eq.1 is examined : @xmath15 \\frac{1}{r } h(c)\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the horizontal diffusion coefficient , the extra velocity component is @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a function containing logarithmic derivatives of the concentration with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "this is only an approximation as the unit vectors along an equipotential @xmath19 and @xmath20 are not parallel .",
    "however , this expression will suffice for the current study .",
    "also it should be noted that there is no term in the angular momentum evolution equation equivalent to the radiation term @xmath21 in eq.1 .",
    "therefore , shellular rotation will still be achieved in the star , although the distribution of the trace element may be anisotropic .",
    "the discussion of turbulent diffusion coefficients @xmath16 has a long history , and the simple approximation due to chaboyer & zahn ( 1992 ) is adopted here : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a number of order unity and @xmath24 is the radial component of the velocity of the bulk meridional circulation . with this replacement eq.2 becomes @xmath25 h(c)\\ ] ] the main controlling parameter here is the ratio of the radial component @xmath24 of the bulk meridional flow and the velocity @xmath26 of the trace element due to the radiation as it slips through the plasma .",
    "if @xmath27 then the turbulent diffusion term will dominate the movement of trace elements , and so the star will become chemically homogeneous on equipotentials . however , if @xmath28 then the distribution of the elements is determined by the extra drift velocity @xmath29 .",
    "the criterion adopted in this paper for chemically inhomogeneous stars is that the extra drift velocity @xmath26 is larger than the typical velocity of meridional motions @xmath24 . in a recent numerical study of the a 20star , urpin _",
    "et al._(1996 ) found that for high rotational velocities , the circulation velocity is less than @xmath30 cm s@xmath31 .",
    "this value is significantly lower than that from eddington - sweet theory , which fails close to the surface of the star .",
    "if velocities of @xmath32 cm  s@xmath31 are produced due to the effects of rotation , then the star may develop metal - rich and metal - poor regions on the same equipotential .",
    "assuming that the potential of the outer parts of a rotating star may be represented using the roche approximation , the radius of equipotential surfaces @xmath33 is dependent on the angle to the pole @xmath13 , and is found by the solution of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the angular velocity , @xmath36 is the radius in the polar direction , and @xmath37 is the mass contained within the equipotential surface .",
    "this has been solved for @xmath38 geometrically by collins & harrington ( 1966 ) . deep within the star",
    "the roche approximation will be incorrect , although for the present discussion , it is adequate .",
    "indeed the region in which it is possible to generate latitudinal metallic abundance anisotropies is found , _ a posteriori _ , to be the outer parts of the envelope and so @xmath39 , and eq.5 will be a good representation .",
    "the flux of the star @xmath40 is proportional to the local gravity ( von zeipel 1924 ) : @xmath41 along the surface of any equipotential the local flux @xmath40 is higher at the pole than the equator ( gravity darkening ) .",
    "this difference between pole and equator is the root cause of the latitudinal variation of the metallic abundance .",
    "it is noted that this gravity darkening actually causes the meridional circulation , else energy would not be conserved in the star .",
    "however , the change in flux is not destroyed by the motions .      the force on ions due to",
    "radiation @xmath42 is dependant on the gradient of the flux passing through that point , i.e. @xmath43 . to facilitate the calculation of the force along an equipotential the ratio of the forces in the radial and latitudinal directions",
    "is now calculated . in the outer parts of the star ,",
    "the luminosity is a constant , and hence the flux varies with distance @xmath33 from the centre of the star as @xmath44 . as the radiative force is proportional to @xmath45 ,",
    "then the ratio of the latitudinal to radial components is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the distance along an equipotential .",
    "again , note this is only an approximation as the unit vectors @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not orthogonal .",
    "this ratio is shown in fig.1 for different rotation rates . as can be seen",
    "it is typically @xmath50 , and therefore , perhaps surprisingly , the radiative force around an equipotential is typically similar to the radial radiative acceleration .",
    "( 100,270 ) ( 0,0 )    michaud _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1976 ) see also alecian & artru ( 1990 ) have discussed the radiative force due to lines on heavy elements .",
    "their expressions , along with eq.7 , lead to the latitudinal force on on a trace element ( with a negligible gradient in the concentration of the ions ) of @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the temperature and effective temperature in units of @xmath54k respectively , @xmath33 is the radius and is the stellar radius .",
    "the atomic parameters are enveloped in @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the atomic mass of the element @xmath57 .    with the inclusion of a non - zero concentration of ions the driving lines become saturated , and the line force",
    "is reduced from eq.8 : @xmath58 ( alecian 1985 ) .",
    "the reference concentration @xmath59 is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the rosseland mean opacity , @xmath62 is the number density of electrons and @xmath63 is an atomic parameter containing line broadening effects .",
    "to calculate a typical order of magnitude of the drift velocity @xmath6 between the ions and rest of the plasma , the radiation force will be approximately balanced by the retarding frictional force .",
    "the diffusion velocity is @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the mass of a proton , @xmath66 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath67 is the charge of the element @xmath57 in units of the fundamental charge @xmath68 .",
    "the thermal diffusion coefficient is @xmath69 and the microscopic diffusion coefficient is @xmath70 .",
    "the effective gravity is zero in the @xmath48 direction ( from the definition of the equipotential ) , and so the third term in parentheses above is zero .",
    "also , the thermal diffusion term is typically small compared to the radiative term and so the diffusion velocity is determined only by the radiative forces , and the concentration gradient .",
    "if the mass of species 1 ( the stellar plasma - mostly hydrogen and helium ) is neglected compared to the mass of species 2 ( the diffusing ions ) , and ion shielding is neglected in the computation of the debye length , eq.40 of paquette _ et al . _  ( 1986 ) becomes @xmath71 where @xmath72\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the density . to obtain a simple expression for the diffusion velocity , an initially chemically homogeneous star is assumed , so that @xmath74 and eq.9 are good representations .",
    "the diffusion velocity is then @xmath75 this expression will overestimate the drift velocity as soon as a concentration gradient is established , as then @xmath76 in eq.11 .",
    "however , with these points in mind , eq.14 is used as an estimate for the velocity in eq.4 .",
    "here the typical drift velocity is calculated for two model stars .",
    "the stellar models have been provided by m. salaris ( private communication ) and are coomputed according to the evolution code described in salaris _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) and references therein .",
    "the two models correspond to ( 2.0 , 1.8@xmath77k ) and ( 5.0 , 3.0@xmath78k ) main sequence stars .",
    "these models are computed with no rotation and solar composition .",
    "although below the models are used to represent non - solar composition rotating stars , it is unlikely that this slight inconsistency will introduce a large error .",
    "the calculation of the atomic parameters @xmath55 and @xmath63 are lengthy and cumbersome , and so the parameters given by alecian _",
    "et al._(1993 ) for iron are assumed ( their table 4 ) , derived using opacity project data .",
    "these are for the states fe fe .",
    "for a given temperature in the model stars , the atomic parameters used are interpolated between those for the dominant , and next dominant ions ( the temperatures at which ions are dominant is given in eq.3 of alecian _ et al . _",
    "these temperatures also give the applicable range used in the calculation : @xmath79 to cover all the ions used .",
    "although the models are calculated with solar metallicity , the drift velocity @xmath26 is calculated for two values of iron abundance : solar abundance @xmath80 and @xmath81 solar .",
    "although strictly this is inconsistent , the error associated in doing so will be very small .    in fig.2 ,",
    "the _ radial _ radiative acceleration is shown for the two stars with solar iron abundance , and should be compared with fig.4 of alecian _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) .",
    "it can be seen that the interpolation used here to calculate the atomic parameters is not introducing any large errors in the calculation .",
    "( 100,270 ) ( 0,0 )    fig.3 shows the value of @xmath26 as a function of the fractional mass exterior to that point @xmath82 for the two models .",
    "the stars is assumed to rotate at 0.7 of their break up velocities ( 0.89 of its break - up angular velocities ) , equal to @xmath83 and 320  respectively for the 2and 5stars .",
    "the top panel of fig.3 corresponds to the 5star , and the lower to the 2star . in each panel , the lines refer to @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the uppermost line corresponding to @xmath87 decreasing downwards .",
    "the solid and dotted lines correspond to iron abundance of solar and @xmath81solar respectively .",
    "( 100,480 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    in three of the four models , the drift velocity exceeds @xmath88",
    "cm s@xmath31 in the outer layers at some latitude .",
    "this indicates that there may be regions in the envelope where iron may start to diffuse round the star . for the 5star the outer @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) of the solar ( @xmath81 solar ) composition model may suffer latitudinal drift of iron .",
    "for the 2star , at @xmath81 solar composition the situation is similar  @xmath32",
    "cm s@xmath31 in the outer @xmath88 of the star",
    ". however for solar composition , there may be no effect as the radiative acceleration on iron is smaller . in this case",
    "the turbulence may homogenise the star faster than the metals may drift due to the radiation .",
    "taken at face value , fig.3 indicates that stars rotating at significant fractions of their break - up velocity may be prone to latitudinal metallic drift in their outer envelopes .",
    "is is likely that a star may come into equilibrium ?",
    "this clearly depends on the timescales over which the relevant processes act . here",
    "the important timescales are ( i ) the diffusion time ( time taken for the ions to diffuse round that star ) , ( ii ) the main - sequence lifetime of the star , ( iii ) the lifetime of each layer ( if mass - loss is present ) .      for an asymmetry to occur in the elemental distribution along an equipotential",
    ", the metals must diffuse a significant distance from their initial latitude to the equator .",
    "this therefore defines a drift timescale @xmath91 , dependent on latitude @xmath92 , which is that over which a latitudinal asymmetry in the metals will be generated : @xmath93    the star only has a finite time in which to allow metals diffuse around its equipotentials .",
    "the main sequence lifetimes for these models are @xmath94yr and @xmath95yr for the 2and 5star respectively .",
    "the mass - loss timescale within the envelope depends on the mass exterior to that point ( @xmath96 ) and the mass loss rate .",
    "if the mass - loss rate  is a function of azimuthal position @xmath13 for rotating stars ( for line - driven winds see friend & abbott 1982 and for radiation - driven dusty winds see dorfi & hfner 1996 ) , then the mass - loss timescale also varies with @xmath13 .",
    "however , as a first approach @xmath97 is taken to be independent of @xmath13 : @xmath98      in order for any significant metallic asymmetry to be generated , the diffusion timescale must be less than the mass - loss timescale .",
    "this ensures that the diffusion process has enough time to act before that layer of the star is lost in an outflow .",
    "the diffusion timescale must also be shorter than the typical main - sequence timescale else no significant asymmetry will build up over the lifetime of the star . therefore , chemical abundance variations may be generated in regions for which the two inequalities @xmath99 are satisfied .",
    "( 100,490 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,0 )    the timescales are displayed in fig.4 .",
    "the lines are the diffusion timescale around the star for @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 with the lower line corresponding to @xmath87 decreasing upwards .",
    "the solid lines are for solar iron abundance , and the dotted lines are for @xmath81 solar abundance .",
    "the oblique dashed lines are the mass loss timescale , corresponding to mass - loss rates of @xmath100(lower ) , @xmath101(upper ) .",
    "fig.4 should be interpreted as follows : the region to the right and lower than the mass - loss timescale lines may , if the diffusion velocity is larger than the diffusive velocity ( @xmath102 the meridional velocity @xmath24 see  2 ) develop metallic abundance gradients around an equipotential .",
    "therefore , the 5model may have enough time to develop a significant abundance gradient across most of the meridian in the outer regions is the mass - loss rate is @xmath103 .",
    "fig.4 suggests that during the main sequence lives of the @xmath81solar abundance 2and both 5stars , the drift velocity due to the anisotropic flux in the star @xmath26 is large enough that a latitudinal abundance gradient may be generated .",
    "however , this statement must be confined to stars which are rotating at significant fractions of break - up , and only applies to bands near to the equator .",
    "although this effect may produce metallic drift , it seems from fig.4 unlikely that the whole of an equipotential @xmath47 will be involved .",
    "it appears that only regions close to the equator will be effected and consequently the metallic distribution will _ not _ come into equilibrium during the star s main - sequence lifetime .",
    "the distribution of metals is therefore difficult to calculate  indeed the dynamical modelling of the distribution is out of the scope of this paper and is flagged for further study .",
    "the results of the previous sections are startling . it has been found that in bands near the equator metals may drift toward the equatorial plane due to the anisotropic radiation field created when the star rotates .",
    "however , it is noted that if the mass - loss rate in the equatorial regions is strongly dependent on the metallicity , then the enhanced mass - loss rate will reduce the time that a given layer is bound to the star . therefore the metallicity enhancement will not be able to build up to such a large level ( as estimated below ) . in this case",
    "then a new equilibrium will be approached in which the magnitude of the metallicity enhancement is controlled by the enhanced mass - loss .",
    "this aspect of the problem is currently being investigated  the homogenising effect of the outer convection zone in the models has , so far , been neglected .",
    "this may homogenise the metallicity fast enough that no effect on the mass - loss rate may be observed .",
    "the drift will slow and eventually stop when the logarithmic concentration gradient becomes comparable with the radiative force ( see eq.11 ) : @xmath104 ( again note this is an approximation as @xmath105 and @xmath20 are not parallel ) . as an example , the temperature is set to @xmath106k corresponding to @xmath107 for both stars .",
    "the radii of the stars of @xmath108 ( 5 ) and 1.8(2 ) . from fig.2",
    "the radial radiative force is @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) for the 5(2 ) star .",
    "if it is assumed that the radiative force around the star @xmath111 is a tenth of this ( see fig.1 ) then the right - hand side of eq.18 is 1360 and 205 for the 5and 2stars respectively .",
    "these are clearly large numbers  indicative of a very large abundance build - up in the equatorial plane .",
    "however as shown in  6 it is unlikely that the whole of the meridian will come into equilibrium .",
    "it may be surmised , though , that significant abundance inhomogeneities can be generated ( without being thwarted by the concentration gradient ) through rotation .    in the course of this paper , radial motions due to radiative acceleration or gravitational settling",
    "have been neglected .",
    "it is likely that a radial component of drift velocity is present as well as the meridional component focussed on here .",
    "therefore , the motion of heavy element ions will not be solely be meridional  if the radial radiative acceleration exceedes gravity , then the drift will be towrd the equator _ and _ toward the surface .",
    "it is difficult to accurately assess the effects of large latitudinal abundance gradients on the structure of a star .",
    "as soon as the abundances change at a given point , then the flux distribution will also change along with the local convective stability criterion .",
    "convection smooths out the abundance overdensity , and provides some feedback to the ionic build up .",
    "it is posssible that this feedback will regulate the ionic drift , modifying the structure of parts of the star .",
    "let us now consider the evolution of the outer envelope of the star during the main sequence .",
    "as the very outer layers are lost in a wind , then a given layer becomes slightly more diffuse and the layer moves to lower @xmath82 ( which will promote latitudinal ion drift ) .",
    "however , as the layer becomes convectively unstable then it is quickly made homogeneous .",
    "the presence of extra radiation - blocking ions in fact make the layer more unstable to convection , and so the equatorial regions of rotating stars can be expected to have a more extensive convective region . due to this rapid convective homogenisation , it is very unlikely then that this latitudinal drift will be observed in the photosphere of the star during its main sequence lifetime ( the possibility of a star having different chemical compositions on the same equipotential has already been considered using radial diffusion and magnetic fields by michaud , mgessier & charland 1981 ) .",
    "the possibility of observing a direct manifestation of latitidinal abundance variation in post main - sequence phases of evolution is currently under study . here",
    "the mass - loss rate may be large enough to prevent complete convective chemical homogenisation of regions which have generated abundance gradients during the main sequence .",
    "it is clear that as the timescales over which a significant abundance gradient may be generated in parts of the star are similar to either mass - loss timescales or main - sequence lifetimes .",
    "therefore the evolution of the star needs to be taken into account whilst considering the abundance time dependence  something which is not attempted here .",
    "although difficult due to necessarily 2d nature of the calculation , it appears that time dependence of the abundance distribution this needs to be included in models for rotating stars .",
    "it has been shown that rotation may indirectly have a large effect on the latitudinal abundance distribution of metals via gravity darkening . indeed , the effect is possibly active in all the model stars considered here .",
    "stars of low metallicity are particularly prone to this effect .",
    "if the mass loss of the star is strongly metallicity dependent , then the effect in the outer layers may be curtailed somewhat .",
    "this may lead to an extra mass - loss rate enhancement in the equatorial plane .",
    "although several major points regarding the effects of meridional diffusion of ions toward the equator have simply been touched on , the principle of metallic latitudinal distribution asymmetries has at least been put on quantitative basis .",
