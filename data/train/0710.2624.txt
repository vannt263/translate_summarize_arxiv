    "the redistribution of electrons in a finite system that occurs when it is exposed to an external electromagnetic field is characterized by a set of constants called polarizabilities@xcite .",
    "static _ polarizabilities refer to static fields , whereas the _ dynamical _ polarizabilities are functions of the frequency of the external field .",
    "usually the name _",
    "polarizability _ is restricted to the constants that determine the cited redistribution to first order in the applied field ",
    "when high - intensity fields are applied , one needs to make use of the higher - order ones or _",
    "hyperpolarizabilities_.    besides characterizing the electromagnetic field - matter interaction , they are also important when studying collision phenomena , and as coarse indicators of physical size , structure and shape .",
    "the knowledge of the polarizability helps to obtain numerous physical quantities that depend on it : the dielectric constant and the refractive index of extended systems , the long - range interaction potentials between polarizable systems , van der waals constants , etc .",
    "the dynamical polarizability , also , contains precious information about the excited states of a finite system : the peaks of the polarizability as a function of the energy determine the excitation energies of the system .",
    "the absorption cross section of a finite system is trivially related to the imaginary part of the dynamical polarizability@xcite .",
    "the oscillator strengths of the transition are the weights of the peaks of this absorption spectrum .",
    "the polarizabilities may also be classified as dipole , quadrupole , etc . , depending on the shape of the perturbing field : for example , the dipole polarizabilities characterize the response of the system to a dipole field . rigorously speaking",
    ", one should also specify the physical magnitude that is measured , and speak , for example , of the dipole - dipole polarizability : the response of the system dipole to a dipole field . in this article",
    ", we will exclusively deal with dipole - dipole first - order polarizabilities  the most commonly studied ones , and arguably the most important for nanostructure characterisation .",
    "since there are three possible directions for the perturbing dipole field , and three possible directions for the system dipole response , the dipole - dipole polarizability is in fact a three - dimensional tensor .    because of its tensorial character , one way of simplifying the calculation of the polarizability is to use neumann s principle  @xcite : the polarizability tensor of the system must be left invariant under any transformation that is also a point symmetry operation of the system .",
    "this condition of invariance reduces the number of independent tensor components , since it signifies relationships between those components , thus potentially reducing the number of calculations necessary to obtain the full tensor .",
    "numerous theoretical techniques can be used to calculate polarizabilities , with varying level of accuracy and detail . in particular",
    ", there is a class of methods that rely on the explicit use of the external perturbation , i.e. each line of the tensor is obtained by performing one calculation . because of this , when using these methods it is not always obvious along which directions the perturbing fields should be aplied in order to make full use of neumann s principle . in this article",
    "we discuss how this can be done .",
    "_ stricto sensu _",
    ", the polarizabilities refer to the reaction to spin - independent ( i.e. , _ electrical _ ) perturbations measured by spin - independent observables ; they are referred to as _ density - density _ response functions .",
    "however , one can also think of more general response functions and apply spin - dependent perturbations and/or look at spin - dependent observables , obtaining in this way _ spin - density _ , _ density - spin _ and _ spin - spin _ response functions ",
    "these generalized objects are sometimes referred to as _",
    "susceptibilities_. even though this work is mainly concerned with the polarizability itself , we will consider these more general objects , since we will also show how the calculation of the _ density - density _ and _ spin - spin _ response of a spin - saturated molecular system may be simplified .    in the following section , we recall the necessary definitions , and list some of the first - principles techniques that can be used to calculate polarizabilities of technologicaly relevant nano and bio structures  some of which can benefit from the simplifications proposed in this article .",
    "these are discussed in section  [ section : method ] .",
    "section  [ section : spin ] shows how essentially the sames ideas may serve to simplify the calculation of the singlet and triplet excitations of systems whose ground - state is spin - saturated .",
    "finally , we present two systems where the technique was used to compute the density - density and the spin - spin responses .",
    "we will now introduce the notation and key quantities that are relevant for the use of symmetries to obtain the different linear response functions .",
    "let @xmath0 be the spin - density of a system of @xmath1 electrons : @xmath2 if we apply an infinitesimal perturbation , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , the response of the density , @xmath5 , will be related to the perturbation , to first order , by a density response function , @xmath6 . in the frequency domain",

    ", the dynamical polarizability can be calculated through real - time propagation of the time - dependent kohn - sham equations@xcite . moreover ,",
    "both static and dynamical polarizabilities can be obtained through straighforward perturbation theory . in this case , `` perturbation theory '' refers to the application of sternheimer equation@xcite in one way or another , either for the static or for the dynamical@xcite case .",
    "another very recent and quite promising approach , is a efficient lanczos - based method@xcite .",
    "for all these methods the calculations rely on the explicit use of the external perturbation .",
    "if we want to calculate the full tensor , we have to perform three calculations , one for each spatial direction .",
    "if , moreover , we need both the density and spin modes , we have to make two calculations per spatial direction , one for each of the two possible perturbations discussed above . in the next sections",
    "we will show how the number of actual calculations can be severely reduced when using these methods by taking advantage of the symmetries of the system .",
    "note that the polarizability can also be obtained , for example , from the response functions , using , for example , the formalism developed by m.  casida@xcite .",
    "this is a case in which the considerations presented below will not simplify the calculations , since they do not proceed by the successive application of the different perturbations .",
    "in this section , we will drop the spin indices , since the whole argument is valid for any of the spin components of the polarizability .    by making use of eq .",
    ", it is easy to prove that @xmath42 is a proper tensor : if we consider a second orthonormal reference frame @xmath46 , @xmath42 transforms following the tensorial transformation law : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the polarizability in the second reference frame , and @xmath49 is the rotation matrix between the two frames .",
    "this tensorial character of the polarizability permits us to work in any orthonormal reference frame ; once we obtain its values , we may easily transform it by straightforward matrix manipulation .",
    "we may then choose the frame which is most appropriate , bearing in mind the geometry of the molecule , and this can reduce the total number of calculations .",

    "we define the polarizability elements @xmath51 as : @xmath52 this corresponds to a process in which the polarization of the perturbing field is along @xmath53 , and the dipole is measured along @xmath54 .",
    "if we know the 3x3 matrix @xmath55 , we get the _ real _ tensor @xmath42 by making use of the following simple relationship , which can be obtained once again from eq .  :",
    "@xmath49 is the transformation matrix between the original orthonormal reference frame and @xmath50 .",
    "note that this transformation is in general not a rotation ; @xmath49 is not unitary . moreover ,",
    "no matter how familiar it looks , eq .   is not a change of coordinates : @xmath55 is _ not _ the polarizability tensor in the new reference frame . and",
    "finally , also note that the traces of @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not coincide : @xmath59 =     { \\rm tr}\\left[\\mathbf{p}^t\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(\\omega)\\mathbf{p}\\right ] =     { \\rm tr}\\left[\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(\\omega)\\mathbf{p}\\mathbf{p}^t\\right]\\,.\\ ] ] but @xmath60 .",
    "notwithstanding this , it tells us that we may obtain the polarizability tensor by calculating the related object @xmath55 .",

    "we consider an initial unit vector , @xmath63 , and define : @xmath64 we assume that this may be done such that the set @xmath50 is linearly independent .",

    "since the matrix is symmetric , we also have the column @xmath66 .",
    "the symmetry of the molecule also permits us to obtain the diagonal : @xmath67 .",
    "the only missing element is @xmath68 , but it is easy to prove that : @xmath69 which we can also get from our original calculation .",
    "the conclusion is that we have access to the full tensor by making only one calculation .    to fix ideas",
    ", we use the example of a molecule with one @xmath70-th order axis of symmetry ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "let @xmath72 be the rotation of @xmath73 degrees around this axis .",
    "we then choose @xmath63 not collinear with this axis , and also not perpendicular to it .",
    "if we define @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the set @xmath76 will be linearly independent . in this case , moreover , since @xmath77 , eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath78 .",
    "it may very well be that we may only find two linearly independent `` equivalent axis '' , @xmath63 and @xmath79 , related by a symmetry transformation , @xmath61  this is the case of a system that possesses only a plane of symmetry , or only an axis of symmetry of order two .",
    "we may then define @xmath63 to be a tilted vector with respect to this plane ( not contained in it , and not perpendicular ) .",
    "then , @xmath80 , where @xmath61 is the reflection on the plane , is an equivalent vector , and @xmath81 can be chosen to lie in the symmetry plane ( the obvious choice will be @xmath82 , that ensures linear independence ) .",
    "we then only need two calculations , one with the polarization along @xmath63 ( or @xmath79 ) and another with the polarization along @xmath83 .",

    "there are many complex molecules of tecnological relevance that present symmetries such that the schemes outlined in the previous sections can be used .",
    "we chose two of them to illustrated the method : protonated triphenylguanidine and one hidrogenated silicon cluster si@xmath92h@xmath93 .",
    "triphenylguanidine compounds are regarded as interesting for quadratic nonlinear optical applications while hidrogenated silicon is an important optico - electronic material with potentially important technological applications .",

    "applying a perturbation of the same form as eq .   with a polarization direction along @xmath63 and using eqs .  , and allowed us to obtain the response functions with just one calculation in both cases .",
    "all response calculations were done with the code octopus  @xcite using the perdew - zunger  @xcite parametrization of the adiabatic local density approximation for the exchange - correlation potential .",
    "this method has already been successfully used for the calculation of optical spectra in a variety of systems , ranging from small molecules@xcite and clusters@xcite to biological systems@xcite .    to represent the wave - functions in real space we used a uniform grid with a spacing of 0.195  and a box composed by spheres of radius 5  around every atom . in order to propagate the kohn - sham orbitals we employed state of the art algorithms@xcite .",
    "a time step of 0.0048fs assured the stability of the time propagation , and a total propagation time of 19.35fs allowed a resolution of about 0.1ev in the resulting spectrum .",

    "[ fig : tpg_response ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : si8h18_response ] where we plot the averaged absorption cross - section ( trace of the tensor ) for singlets and triplets .",
    "in summary , we presented a scheme that can considerably reduce the number of calculations necessary to obtain the full polarizability tensor by using the symmetries of the system .",
    "these can be spatial symmetries ( like planes of inversion or symmetry axis , e.g. ) or they can lie in spin space ( if the ground - state is spin saturated ) . finally , the scheme is trivial to implement , and can be easily extended to different symmetries and different responses i.e. higher multipole responses , and higher order hyperpolarizabilities  , so we expect that its usefulness to surpass the present context .",
