    "<S> the corresponding eigenfunctions are chiral and the number of left- and right - handed zero modes are related to the topological charge of the gauge configuration : @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed by many that this theorem has important consequences on the low energy properties of qcd . </S>",

    "<S> the dirac operator is expected to have a large number of quasi - zero modes which could be responsible for spontaneous chiral symmetry - breaking @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> typical gauge field configurations contributing to the path integral are not smooth , however . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the regularization which is necessary to define the quantum field theory breaks some other conditions of the index theorem as well . </S>",
    "<S> standard lattice formulations , for example , violate the conditions of the index theorem in all possible ways : the topological charge of coarse gauge configurations is not properly defined and the dirac operator breaks the chiral symmetry in an essential way . in the continuum limit these problems disappear , while close to the continuum some trace of the index theorem can be identified @xcite . in general , however , the expected chiral zero modes are washed away and , even worse , unwanted real modes occur as lattice artifacts ( exceptional configurations ) @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we are going to show here that a lattice formulation of qcd working with the fixed point ( fp ) action ( classically perfect action ) [ 611 ] and fp topological charge @xcite which are defined in the context of wilson s renormalization group theory @xcite , solves all these problems : the index theorem remains valid on the lattice even if the cut - off is small ( the resolution is poor ) . </S>",

    "<S> here we shall follow another way which allows to prove the index theorem on the lattice directly and leads to additional results as well </S>",
