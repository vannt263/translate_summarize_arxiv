    "many seyfert 1 galaxies and radio - quiet quasars possess x - ray spectra that steepen below @xmath1  kev .",
    "this ` soft excess ' emission , usually defined as the excess emission over and above the hard x - ray power - law , was first seen in spectra obtained by  ( pravdo 1981 ) ,  ( arnaud 1985 ; turner & pounds 1989 ) and  ( bechtold  1987 ) . its physical origin remains uncertain , as does its connection with the so - called ` big blue bump ' emission rising through the ultraviolet , although it is often associated with thermal emission from the putative accretion disc ( e.g. arnaud  1985 ; czerny & elvis 1987 ) .",
    "boller , brandt & fink ( 1996 ) and laor  ( 1997 ) showed that the objects with the steepest soft x - ray spectra ( implying the strongest soft excesses ) tend to have relatively narrow optical  lines ; many are classified optically as narrow - line seyfert 1s ( nls1s ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "these ` ultrasoft ' seyferts often show other notable properties such as very rapid x - ray variability ( e.g. forster & halpern 1996 ; boller  1997 ; turner  1999 ; leighly 1999a ; brandt 1999 ) and strong optical  emission ( e.g. lawrence  1997 ; vaughan  2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectral form , x - ray variability and optical broad - line properties seem interconnected .    here",
    "we report the results of a 30  ksec  observation of tonantzintla s180 ( @xmath2 ) obtained as part of a guaranteed time programme ( pi : th .",

    "is one of the x - ray brightest ultrasoft seyferts ( vaughan  1999 ; leighly 1999a ) and its luminosity is such that it is often classified as a quasar .",
    "previous x - ray observations with  ( turner , george & nandra 1998 ; vaughan  1999 ; leighly 1999b ; ballantyne , iwasawa & fabian 2001 ) and  ( comastri 1998 ) showed a strong excess of soft emission and tentative evidence for an ionised iron line . the more recent high - resolution letgs spectrum ( turner  2001b ) showed no strong , narrow absorption or emission features and showed the soft x - ray continuum is smooth and featureless .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in the following section the observation and basic data reduction procedures",
    "are outlined .",
    "section  [ sect : spectra ] describes the x - ray spectral fitting results .",

    "( jansen  2001 ) carries three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) , specifically two mos ( turner  2001a ) and one pn ( strder  2001 ) ccd camera .",
    "in addition there are two reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ; den herder  2001 ) and an optical monitor ( om ; mason  2001 ) .     observed  on 2000 december 14 ( revolution 0186 ) for a duration of @xmath330  ksec , during which all instruments were operating nominally .",
    "the mos1 camera was in timing mode , which severely complicates the analysis , and these data are ignored in the present paper .",
    "both the mos2 and pn were operated in small window mode to reduce `` pile up '' from this relatively bright ( few ct s@xmath4 ) source , and all epic cameras used the medium filter .",
    "the rgs was operated in standard ( spectro+q ) mode .",
    "extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system v5.3 ( sas ) .",
    "the raw data were processed to produce calibrated event lists and screened to remove unwanted hot , dead or flickering pixels , and events due to electronic noise .",
    "light curves extracted from these event lists showed the background to be stable throughout the duration of the observation .",
    "the total amount of `` good '' exposure time selected was @xmath5  s and @xmath6  s for mos2 and pn , respectively , and @xmath7  s and @xmath8  s for rgs1 and rgs2 .",
    "( the lower pn exposure is due to the lower `` live time '' of the pn camera in small - window mode , @xmath371 per cent ; strder  2001 ) .",
    "source data were extracted from circular regions of radius 35from the mos2 and pn , and show no signs of pile - up .",
    "background events were extracted from off - source regions .",
    "events corresponding to patterns 012 ( single  quadruple pixel events ) were extracted from mos2 and patterns 04 ( singles and doubles ) were used for the pn analysis , after checking for consistency with the data extracted using only single pixel events ( pattern 0 ) .",
    "standard redistribution matrices ( m2_r6_all_15.rmf for mos2 and epn_sw20_sdy9.rmf for the pn ) were used , and ancillary response files were generated using arfgen v1.48.8 .",
    "first - order rgs spectra were extracted using the rgsproc v1.3.3 script , and appropriate response matrices were generated using rgsrmfgen v1.44.5 .",
    "the total number of `` good '' source events extracted was @xmath9 for the pn , @xmath10 for mos2 and @xmath11 for each rgs .",
    "the source spectra were grouped such that each spectral bin contains at least 20 counts , and they were fitted using the xspec v11.1 software package ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the quoted errors on the derived best - fitting model parameters correspond to a 90 per cent confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. , a @xmath12 criterion ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "values of @xmath13  km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and @xmath14 are assumed throughout the paper , and fit parameters are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "the two epic spectra were first examined separately to test for discrepancies .",
    "the data were fitted over 2.510  kev using a model comprised of a power - law modified by galactic absorption ( with fixed column density @xmath15  @xmath16 ; dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "this provided a reasonable fit to both spectra ( @xmath17  degrees of freedom and @xmath18 for the mos2 and pn data , respectively ) with consistent normalisations and photon indices ( @xmath19 for mos2 and @xmath20 for pn ) .",
    "given this good agreement between the two spectra over the 2.510  kev energy range , the data were fitted simultaneously in the rest of the spectral analysis , but in each fit the residuals from the two spectra were examined separately to check for inconsistencies .",
    "the relative normalisations were left free to allow for slight differences in absolute flux calibration between the two detectors .",
    "figure  [ fig : hard_spec ] shows the two epic spectra compared to a simple power - law fitted over 2.510  kev . as expected from the fits to the individual spectra , this model ( @xmath21 ) is in excellent agreement with the data ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the pn spectrum shows positive residuals around @xmath24  kev which could indicate spectral features from iron k. to test for this an intrinsically narrow ( @xmath25  ev ) gaussian emission line was added to the model . with the narrow line energy fixed at 6.4",
    "kev the fit was not significantly improved ; the 90 per cent upper limit of the equivalent width of a narrow , neutral iron line is @xmath26  ev .",
    "allowing the line energy to be free provided an improvement to the fit ( @xmath27 ) but the best - fitting line energy of @xmath28  kev is marginally too high for k@xmath23 emission from even hydrogen - like iron .",
    "the equivalent width of this line is @xmath29  ev . according to an @xmath30-test , upon adding two parameters ( line flux and energy ) the fit is significantly improved at 98.5 per cent confidence .. allowing the line width to be free improved the fit further ( @xmath31 ) with a best - fitting width of @xmath32  kev and an energy of @xmath33  kev , which is consistent with k@xmath23 emission from h - like iron .",
    "an @xmath30-test suggests the fit is improved , at 98.8 per cent confidence , upon allowing the line width to be free .",
    "this broad line is strong , with an equivalent width of @xmath34  ev .",
    "the high energy derived from the line might instead be indicating the presence of iron k absorption ( at @xmath35  kev ) , but this seems unlikely . replacing the broad gaussian with an absorption edge gave a worse fit ( @xmath36 ) , with edge parameters @xmath37  kev and @xmath38 .    using a diskline line profile ( fabian  1989 ) to model the residuals around @xmath39  kev",
    "provided a comparable fit to the broad gaussian ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "an @xmath30-test suggests this improvement to the fit , compared to the simple power - law model , is significant at @xmath41 per cent confidence .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of the line were the following : rest - frame energy @xmath42  kev , @xmath43  ev and inclination angle @xmath44  deg . allowing the other free parameters ( inner radius @xmath45 , outer radius @xmath46 , and disc emissivity index @xmath47 ) to be free",
    "did not improve the fit significantly , and thus these parameters were kept fixed at @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : hard_spec ] , the excess at @xmath24  kev in the pn data is not obvious in the mos2 data ; however , the two spectra are formally consistent with one another .",
    "when the normalisation of the diskline was allowed to be free between the two detectors , the best fitting normalisations were consistent , although the normalisation form the mos2 spectrum is poorly constrained and is consistent with zero .",
    "the above results are suggestive of `` reflection '' off a ( possibly ionised ) accretion disc .",
    "to provide a more physically realistic description of emission from an ionised disc , the model of ross & fabian ( 1993 ) ( see also ballantyne  2001 ) was fitted to the data ( assuming solar abundances ) .",
    "the disc reflection spectrum was blurred using the laor kernel ( laor 1991 ) to simulate doppler and gravitational effects around a black hole .",
    "the best fitting ionised disc model gives a good fit ( @xmath51 ) with @xmath52 , @xmath53 and fairly low ionisation ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the laor profile parameters were only poorly constrained and were kept fixed ( as above ) .",
    "we conclude that the presence of a broad , ionised iron line ( as previously suggested by comastri  1998 and turner 1998 ) is consistent with the  data , but the line parameters are only poorly constrained .",
    "having parameterised the spectrum above 2.5  kev the analysis was extended to cover the full useful spectral bandpass of  by including the epic data down to 0.3  kev and the rgs data .",
    "however , there are significant differences between the mos2 and pn spectra below 1  kev ; the difference is most pronounced around 0.56  kev .",
    "there is a similar feature present in the calibration observation of mrk 421 , which is almost certainly related to the instrumental o k - edge at 0.537  kev and seems to be most pronounced in data taken in pn small - window mode ( as here ) .",
    "the residuals in the mos camera are at a much lower level ( @xmath55 per cent ) in this spectral region . for these reasons",
    "a conservative restriction was applied to the pn data , the spectrum was fitted between 1.210  kev only , while the mos2 data were used over the 0.310  kev band .",
    "an extrapolation of the simple 2.510  kev power - law model down to 0.3  kev ( figure  [ fig : full_spec ] ) shows a smooth upturn in the epic spectrum : the soft excess .",
    "there does not seem to be an obvious transition from hard power - law to soft excess in the spectrum , on the contrary , the spectrum is gently curving up to at least 2  kev .",
    "the average observed flux in the 0.310  kev band was @xmath56  erg s@xmath4 @xmath16 and the corresponding ( unabsorbed ) luminosity was @xmath57  erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is most likely @xmath58  erg s@xmath4 ( this is a conservative estimate as  probably harbours a strong euv excess ; turner  2002 ) .",
    "assuming  is radiating at the eddington limit ( or lower ) then it requires a black hole mass @xmath59 ( see also turner  2001b ) .    ) and extrapolating to lower energies , revealing the curved continuum .",
    "the bottom two panels show the results of fitting with a power - law plus blackbody or a two power - law model .",
    "( the data were rebinned for display purposes.),width=8 ]      the 0.351.5  kev rgs data confirm that the soft excess emission in  is a smooth continuum , as seen by turner  ( 2001b ) from  letgs data .",
    "figure  [ fig : rgs_spec ] shows the background subtracted rgs spectrum of  in flux units ( rgs1 and rgs2 combined ) .",
    "an absorbed power - law provides a good fit to the data ( @xmath60 ) with the absorbing column fixed at the galactic value and a power - law slope of @xmath61 .",
    "there are no significant sharp residuals in the rgs spectrum , the only obvious deviation from the power - law model is around 0.50.6  kev and is probably associated with the o k - edge in the detector response .",
    "the equivalent widths of any narrow absorption features are restricted to @xmath62  ev ( 90 per cent upper limit ) in the 0.350.70  kev energy range , @xmath63  ev in the 0.71.0  kev range and @xmath64  ev in the 1.01.5  kev range .",
    "thus the soft excess in  is a smooth continuum resembling a power - law . in the following sections the epic spectra",
    "are used to test various physical models for the soft excess emission .",
    "given that the rgs spectrum can be fitted with a steep power law , the broad - band epic spectrum was first compared to a simple double power - law model , similar to that used by comastri  ( 1998 ) in their analysis of a  observation of . fitting with a broken power - law model gave @xmath65 with slopes @xmath66 , @xmath67 and a break energy @xmath68  kev .",
    "a slightly better fit was obtained using two separate power - laws ( @xmath69 ) with slopes @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( see figure  [ fig : full_spec ] ) . in this model",
    "the softer of the two power - laws dominates the spectrum up to @xmath72  kev .",
    "the harder power - law is considerably flatter than in the broken power - law parameterisation , due to the addition of the steeper power - law over the whole band , and is perhaps unrealistically flat .",
    "these simple fits to the epic data , and the rgs results , show that the soft excess has the form of a steep power - law .    figure  [ fig : sed ] places the  spectrum in the context of the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) compiled by turner  ( 2002 ) .",
    "the multiwavelength data were taken approximately one year before the  observation , but it is clear that the x - ray spectral form did not change drastically between observations .    ) .",
    "the dots show the multiwavelength data from turner  ( 2002 ) corrected to match the slightly different cosmology used here .",
    ", width=6 ]      the possible presence of iron k@xmath23 emission ( section  [ sect : iron_line ] ) may indicate significant reflection off the surface of the accretion disc .",
    "the reflection spectrum can be strong below @xmath73  kev and could contribute significantly to the soft excess . to test whether the soft excess in  could be produced by reprocessing of primary x - rays in the disc the reflection model discussed in section  [ sect : iron_line ]",
    "was fitted to the 0.310  kev spectrum . the best fitting model obtained for the data above 2.5  kev gave a very poor fit to the broad - band data ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the ionisation state of the reflector means it produces strong o  vii recombination emission , not obvious in the data , while the total reflected flux below 2  kev falls far short of the observed soft excess .    refitting this model to the full - band epic data still provided a rather poor fit to the data ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the best fitting parameters were @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and parameters of the laor kernel were @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 was kept fixed at @xmath82 ) . in this model",
    "the disc surface is highly ionised and produces a smooth excess of emission in the soft band , partly from bremsstrahlung in the irradiated skin of the disc , with relatively weak spectral features .",
    "however , this model leaves significant residuals in the fit above 7  kev , where it predicts a strong , ionised iron edge .",
    "thus the low - energy data seemed to require a highly ionised reflector , while the higher - energy spectrum suggested a reflector with much lower ionisation .",
    "allowing for two reflection components , with different ionisation parameters , improved the fit ( @xmath83 ) . in this fit",
    "the continuum slope was @xmath84 incident on reflectors with ionisation parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the laor profile parameters were @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this model",
    "the highly ionised reflector had relative strength @xmath89 while the colder reflector was much stronger , with @xmath90 .",
    "both reflection components contributed to the soft excess emission , but the strong colder reflector improved the fit to the hard x - ray data , although significant residuals still remained above 7  kev . the small inner radius of the laor kernel was required in order to smooth sufficiently the recombination features present in the reflection spectra .",
    "a power - law plus single blackbody component , to model the soft excess , provided a poor fit to the data ( @xmath91 , see figure  [ fig : full_spec ] ) . including a second blackbody component significantly improved the fit ( @xmath92 ) , while a power - law plus three blackbodies provided an excellent fit ( @xmath93 ) with the following parameters : @xmath94 , @xmath95  ev , @xmath96  ev , @xmath97  ev .",
    "this multiple blackbody parameterisation is similar to that used to characterise the broad - band x - ray spectra of other ultrasoft seyferts , e.g. , re  j1034 + 396 ( pounds , done & osborne , 1995 ) , pks 0558504 ( obrien  2001 ) and 1h 0419577 ( page  2002 ) .",
    "however , while this multiple blackbody model did provide an adequate fit to the data , the temperatures and luminosities of these components are at odds with those expected for a simple accretion disc .",
    "a standard accretion disc around a @xmath98 black hole should have a peak temperature @xmath99  ev , much lower than the hottest temperature in the multiple blackbody model .",
    "the observed temperatures and luminosities predict sizes of the blackbody emitting regions of @xmath100  cm for the hottest and @xmath101  cm for the coolest , which are also difficult to reconcile with a simple accretion disc around a @xmath102 black hole ( @xmath103  cm ) .",
    "fitting the data with a more realistic thermal accretion disc spectrum , using the diskpn code ( gierliski  1999 ) , provided a poor fit to the data ( @xmath104 ) , because the model spectrum is not broad enough , and again it gave an unreasonably high temperature ( @xmath105  ev ) .",
    "the strong , rapid variability of the soft excess ( section  [ sect : timing ] ) also seems incompatible with the expected timescales in a simple accretion disc ( see also boller  1997 ) .",
    "these results would seem to reject an origin for the soft excess in terms of ( un - modified ) thermal emission from an accretion disc .",
    "but , as discussed by e.g. bechtold  ( 1987 ) , czerny & elvis ( 1987 ) and ross , fabian & mineshige ( 1992 ) , inverse - compton scattering in the upper layers of the disc atmosphere should significantly affect the observed high - energy tail of the disc emission .",
    "this possibility is discussed below .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of soft photons in an optically thick medium ( i.e. , @xmath106 ; where the diffusion approximation is valid ) produces an approximately power - law spectrum at low energies .",
    "thus , as the soft excess in  resembles a steep power - law , a comptonised blackbody component should provide a reasonable fit .",
    "the energy index of the comptonised spectrum is determined by the compton @xmath107-parameter ( @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the dimensionless electron temperature ) according to @xmath110 ( e.g. , section 7.7 of rybicki & lightman , 1979 ) .",
    "this means that it is not possible to solve for both @xmath111 and @xmath112 from knowledge of the spectral slope alone . using",
    "the double power - law parameterisation of  ( section  [ sect : phenom ] ) gave a slope of @xmath113 for the soft excess , which corresponds to @xmath114 and it is possible to obtain this value , and hence the observed spectral slope , for a range of @xmath111 and @xmath112 values .",
    "a similar situation occurs when considering the optically thin regime , in which case the spectral slope is determined by @xmath115",
    ". see zdziarski ( 1985 ) and references therein for more details .",
    "the comptt code ( titarchuk 1994 ) was used to model comptonisation of soft photons in a thermal plasma .",
    "a power - law plus comptonisation component gave a good fit to the data ( @xmath116 ) with @xmath117 and the soft excess modelled by comptonisation of a thermal spectrum from a @xmath118  ev source .",
    "however , for the reasons mentioned above , the temperature and optical depth of the comptonising plasma are strongly covariant parameters , and thus can not be constrained simultaneously .",
    "fitting the spectrum with just two comptonisation components , similar to the model used by obrien  ( 2001 ) and page  ( 2002 ) , gave a good fit ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "the seed photon temperature was @xmath120  ev , but the parameters of the two plasmas were poorly constrained due to the degeneracy mentioned above .",
    "( similar fits were obtained using the  code , discussed below , to model two purely thermal plasmas . )",
    "it seems reasonable to associate the source of the soft seed photons with the thermal emission from the inner regions of an optically thick accretion disc .",
    "the existence of two discrete comptonising plasmas is not so easy to explain , especially given that they varied almost identically on short timescales ( section [ sect : timing ] ) .",
    "the double comptonisation model described above has the two spectrally identified continua ( soft and hard power - laws ) originating in two distinct thermal comptonising plasmas .",
    "an alternative is that the whole spectrum is produced by a single plasma with a hybrid thermal / non - thermal electron distribution ( see coppi 1999 for a discussion of the physics of such plasmas ) .",
    "gierliski  ( 1999 ) modelled the spectrum of the galactic black hole candidate ( gbhc ) cygnus x-1 in its high / soft state in terms of a hybrid plasma . in this model",
    "the cyg x-1 spectrum is comprised of a blackbody from the accretion disc , plus a component due to inverse - compton scattering of the disc photons in a corona containing both thermal and non - thermal electrons . the non - thermal tail to the electron distribution produces the steep power - law tail of the x - ray spectrum dominating above 10  kev ( and observed up to at least @xmath121  kev ) and the thermal electrons produce a `` soft excess '' at a few kev between the non - thermal tail and the accretion disc spectrum .",
    "the definite detection of a non - thermal comptonisation component requires high - energy data , which are not available here , but , as first noted by pounds  ( 1995 ) , the x - ray spectra of ultrasoft seyferts do resemble that of cyg x-1 in its high / soft state .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to test whether a hybrid thermal / non - thermal plasma is a viable model for the x - ray continuum of .",
    "the  code ( coppi 1992 ; gierliski  1999 ) was used to compute the spectrum formed by comptonisation of a blackbody photons in a plasma with an hybrid electron distribution .",
    "non - thermal ( relativistic ) electrons are injected ( by some unspecified process ) as a power - law in lorentz factor , @xmath122 , into a background thermal plasma , the rate of injection is given by : @xmath123 ( between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) . the total optical depth ( including that produced by e@xmath126 pairs ) and the equilibrium temperature of the thermal component ( after accounting for coulomb heating by non - thermal e@xmath126 and compton heating / cooling )",
    "are computed self - consistently once the initial parameters have been specified . for a detailed discussion of the processes accounted for by this code see gierliski  ( 1999 ) and coppi ( 1999 ) .",
    "the important parameters of the model are the following : the temperature of the input thermal disc spectrum @xmath127 ; the soft compactness @xmath128 , which corresponds to the power supplied by soft seed photons ( @xmath129 is the total seed photon luminosity and @xmath130 is the radius of the emission region ) ; the similarly defined thermal compactness @xmath131 , corresponding to the heating supplied to thermal electrons ; the non - thermal compactness @xmath132 , which gives the rate of injection of non - thermal electrons ; the index of the non - thermal electron injection spectrum @xmath133 ; and the optical depth @xmath134 of the background electron - proton plasma .    with so many parameters ( some of which were covariant in the fit ) the @xmath135-space contained many local minima . in order to reduce the complexity of the fit some parameters were fixed at physically reasonable values ( these are discussed further below ) .",
    "the details of the fitted model parameters will obviously depend on the chosen values for those parameters kept fixed .",
    "thus , while the following fits demonstrate that the  model can reproduce the shape of the  spectrum , the exact values of the fitted model parameters should be treated with some caution .    the total compactness @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is the total hard compactness ) is not constrained by the  spectra .",
    "if the spectrum extends out to @xmath138  kev a high compactness will lead to efficient pair production , but the strongest observable consequence of the presence of pairs is an annihilation line at 511  kev . in the absence of this information the soft compactness was therefore kept fixed at @xmath139 ( the lower limit obtained in section  [ sect : timing ] ) and the ratios @xmath140 and @xmath141 were used as free parameters in the fitting . assuming the corona covers the inner disc , the former is related to the ratio of power dissipated in the corona compared to the disc , and",
    "the latter gives the fraction of power deposited in the corona that goes into the non - thermal component .",
    "the radius of the emitting region was kept fixed at @xmath142  cm , this is @xmath143 for a @xmath144 black hole , and at the above assumed value of @xmath145 this gives a reasonable soft x - ray luminosity .",
    "the temperature of the seed blackbody was fixed at @xmath146  ev and the minimum and maximum lorentz factors for the non - thermal injection spectrum were @xmath147 and @xmath148 ( the resulting model spectrum is largely insensitive to the chosen value of @xmath125 when @xmath149 ) .",
    "the  model gave a good fit ( @xmath150 ) with the following parameters : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "thus there is marginally more power supplied by the seed photons than the coronal electrons , and most of the electron heating is in the form of non - thermal electrons which are injected with a steep spectrum .",
    "the soft excess is produced by compton scattering of the accretion disc spectrum by thermalised electrons , and the emission above a few kev is produced by the non - thermal component .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by gierliski  ( 1999 ) for the high / soft state spectrum of cyg x-1 ; the significant difference is that in this case the optical depth of the background plasma is much higher than in cyg x-1 . if the optical depth is kept fixed at @xmath155 a slightly poorer ( but still acceptable ) fit is obtained ( @xmath156 ) . again",
    "the soft excess is produced by compton scattering of seed photons by thermal electrons , and the harder x - ray emission is produced by the non - thermal electrons .",
    "this section describes timing analyses of the epic data .",
    "results are presented only for the pn data , which have the highest signal - to - noise , but the results were checked against the mos2 data and the two were found to be entirely consistent .",

    "this was used to estimate the radiative efficiency @xmath163 of the source , assuming photon diffusion through a spherical mass of accreting matter , following fabian ( 1979 ) : @xmath164  erg s@xmath162 .",
    "( but see also brandt 1999 , for a discussion of the assumptions used in this calculation . )",
    "this gave a limit of @xmath165 per cent .",
    "the rapid variability was also used to place a limit on the compactness parameter , following done & fabian ( 1989 ) . assuming that @xmath166 gives @xmath167  erg s@xmath162 . for  this",
    "gave @xmath168 .",
    "figure  [ fig : curves ] also shows the pn light curves extracted from five different energy bands in 500  s bins .",
    "the light curves all show similar trends , albeit with relatively poor signal - to - noise in the harder bands . the hardness ratios of these light curves were examined as a first test of spectral variability .",
    "the ten hardness ratios ( six of which are shown in figure  [ fig : ratios ] ) from the five light curves were each compared to a constant using a @xmath169 test .",
    "four of the ten hardness ratios examined were inconsistent with a constant hypothesis at @xmath170 per cent confidence .",
    "these ratios , namely @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 , are also among the highest signal - to - noise ratios . using the spearman rank - order correlation coefficient and the kendall @xmath111statistic ( see e.g. , press  1992 ) to test for correlations ,",
    "none of the hardness ratios was correlated with the broad - band count rate at greater than 90 per cent confidence .",
    "figure  [ fig : hilow ] shows a comparison of pn spectra extracted from intervals of high and low flux .",
    "these were extracted from only those intervals when the source count rate was above 10 ct s@xmath4 ( high ) or below 8.8 ct s@xmath4 ( low ) .",
    "the high and low flux spectra contained @xmath175  ct and @xmath176  ct , respectively .",
    "the ratio of high to low flux spectra is consistent with a constant ( @xmath177 ) , again indicating a lack of flux - correlated spectral variability .",
    "the normalised rms spectrum was calculated in order to quantify the degree of variability in the different energy bands , again using the 500  s binned light curves .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude was measured using the @xmath178 statistic ( edelson  2002 ) which is equal to the square root of the normalised excess variance @xmath179 ( nandra  1997 ) .",
    "the errors were estimated using the formula in edelson  ( 2002 ) and should be considered as conservative estimates on the true uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : rms ] shows the fractional variability amplitude calculated in ten energy bands , which changes by only 3 per cent over the  band - pass .",
    "this remarkably flat rms spectrum contrasts with the situation in many ` normal ' spectrum seyfert 1s , which tend to show larger fractional variations at lower energies ( e.g. nandra  1997 ) . altering the sizes of the time bins or",
    "the energy ranges used in the light curves made little difference to the rms spectrum since most of the variability power is on timescales @xmath180  s.     values were calculated using 500  s binned data .",
    ", width=6 ]    having established that the light curves show similar trends and almost identical amplitudes , the temporal cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) were calculated in order to search for leads or lags between different energy bands . the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) of edelson & krolik ( 1988 )",
    "was used as an estimator of the ccf .",
    "the other nine energy bands used in the rms spectrum were compared to the softest band ( 0.20.3  kev ) .",
    "of the nine ccfs examined eight peaked at zero - lag ( e.g. , see figure  [ fig : ccf ] ) and the one exception ( @xmath181  kev against @xmath182  kev ) peaked at a lag of only one time bin ( 500  s , with the harder band lagging the softer band ) which we do not consider to be significant . in all cases",
    "the ccf was reasonably symmetric .",
    "these results indicate there is no evidence for a lag or lead between the various energy bands to a limit of @xmath183  s.",
    "this paper presents an uninterrupted @xmath160  ksec  observation of the ultrasoft , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy .",
    "the spectrum above 2.5  kev is slightly steeper than the norm for seyfert 1 galaxies ( @xmath184 compared to @xmath185 ) but the iron k@xmath23 line emission is only poorly constrained . at lower energies the spectrum steepens , seen as a soft excess over the hard x - ray power - law with a featureless , approximately power - law form .",
    "the shape of the soft excess is similar to that observed in other objects .",
    "for example , marshall  ( 2002 ) found the high - resolution soft x - ray spectrum of the ultrasoft seyfert 1 mrk  478 ( which has a similar x - ray luminosity to ) was a featureless power - law .",
    "pks 0558504 also showed a similar soft excess shape ( obrien  2001 ) .",
    "the  hetgs observation of the variable , narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  4051 again showed the soft excess to be a rapidly variable continuum component .",
    "however , in this lower - luminosity source it showed significant spectral curvature ( collinge  2001 ) .",
    "the observed flux of  showed rapid variability , changing by @xmath186 per cent during the observation , but showed only weak spectral variability .",
    "this implies that , to first order at least , the curved x - ray spectrum is varying as one component .",
    "there are indications that this may be a general result , that seyferts with steep x - ray spectra show very little spectral variability ( at least on short timescales ) .",
    "the  monitoring of ark  564 and  showed flat rms spectra ( turner  2001c ; romano  2001 ; edelson  2002 ) , as did the recent  observation of 1h  0707495 ( boller 2002 ) .",
    "this lack of short timescale spectral variability is somewhat different from the case in `` normal '' seyfert 1s , which tend to show stronger variability at lower energies ( e.g. , nandra  1997 ; markowitz & edelson , 2001 ; vaughan & edelson , 2001 ) .",
    "the lack of strong spectral features means that the observed form of the soft excess is consistent with a range of models .",
    "the data clearly rule out models based on blends of narrow soft x - ray lines ( e.g. , turner  1991 ) , but leave a variety of continuum emission mechanisms as plausible alternatives .",
    "reprocessing of primary x - rays by an ionised accretion disc can produce a strong , smooth excess similar to that observed but has difficulty simultaneously explaining the hard x - ray spectrum ( section  [ sect : refl_spec ] ) .",
    "the observed lack of spectral variability is also a challenge for this model .",
    "the highly correlated , simultaneous variability between 310  kev flux ( dominated by the primary x - rays ) and softer x - ray bands ( dominated by the reprocessed emission ) requires the reprocessing to produce a near - perfect `` reverberation '' signature with a delay of @xmath187  s ( section  [ sect : timing ] ) . assuming a black hole mass of @xmath188 ( from the eddington limit ) this places the reprocessor within @xmath189 of the hard x - ray source .",
    "as first pointed out by bechtold  ( 1987 ) the soft excess is too hot to be `` bare '' thermal emission from the accretion disc .",
    "the spectral form is consistent with emission from multiple blackbody components , but the derived temperatures and sizes are inconsistent with those predicted for an accretion disc ( unless  is highly super - eddington ) .",
    "allowing for doppler and gravitational shifts does not significantly alter this result .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of soft photons by thermal electrons provides a more physically satisfying explanation for the broad soft excess ( sections  [ sect : compt_spec ] and [ sect : compt2_spec ] ) , in which case the seed photon source is consistent with thermal accretion disc emission .",
    "the harder power - law emission extending to 10  kev ( and presumably beyond ) can also be produced by comptonisation , either in another purely thermal plasma or by non - thermal electrons in a plasma with a hybrid thermal / non - thermal distribution . whether this is dominated by thermal or non - thermal electrons",
    "is impossible to tell without higher energy data ; fits using thermal and hybrid thermal / non - thermal models are comparable in the  band , where the predicted spectra both resemble power - laws .",
    "a problem with the models discussed above is that they have difficulty explaining the rapid and energy - independent variability of ( section  [ sect : timing ] ) .",
    "these constraints force the hard and soft x - ray producing regions to be in very close causal contact with one another . if at high accretion rates the disc is puffed - up due to radiation pressure , then it is possible that the separation between the hot corona and the optically thick accretion disc can be negligibly small . in this scenario ,",
    "some fraction of the accretion energy is dissipated in the surface layers of the disc , producing hot electrons which can comptonise the soft photons from below .",
    "the accretion disc model of hubeny  ( 2001 ) demonstrates the formation of a hot upper layer to the accretion disc due to dissipation near the surface ( see their figure 10 ) , and simulations of magnetized accretion discs by miller & stone ( 2000 ) suggest that even higher temperatures may be reached , leading to the formation of a true corona .",
    "simulations of emergent disc spectra accounting for dissipation in the upper atmosphere will be presented elsewhere ( ross  in prep . ) , but early indications suggest that the observed strong , smooth soft excess can be reproduced .",
    "we also note the lack of a significant narrow , neutral iron emission line at 6.4  kev . the formal",
    "( 90 per cent ) upper limit on the equivalent with of such a line is @xmath190  ev , similar to that obtained for 1h 0707495 by boller  ( 2002 ) .",
    "again this contrasts with the situation in more normal seyfert 1s , which tend to show a narrow 6.4  kev emission line from distant , cold material ( e.g. , yaqoob , george & turner , 2002 ) .",
    "however , whether this is due to a systematic difference between ultrasoft and normal seyfert 1s remains to be seen .",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
