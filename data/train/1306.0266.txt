    "tantalum ( ta ) metal is used frequently as the pressure scale in the diamond - anvil cell ( dac ) and shock wave ( sw ) experiments , thanks to its high stability , chemical inertness , and very high melting temperature .",
    "it has attracted tremendous interests on its very wide range of properties in recent years . among these properties , melting is the most intriguing one because there are very large discrepancies in its high - pressure melting temperature between different experiments . in detail , there exist several thousand degrees of discrepancies in the melting temperature of ta when extrapolating from the diamond - anvil cell ( dac )  @xcite pressures of @xmath1100 gpa to the shock wave ( sw )  @xcite pressure of @xmath1300 gpa .",
    "extensive investigations have been performed to understand the underlying causes both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the melting discrepancies of ta still remain inconclusive up to now .",
    "most recently , dewaele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite revisited the melting curve of ta via dac experiment and obtained a much higher result compared to previously reported flat dac melting curve  @xcite . in their dac experiment , they excluded the effects of chemical reactivity of ta samples with pressure medium and pressure medium melting . and",
    "they believe that the previous tantalum melting curve  @xcite has been underestimated because of the undetected chemical reactions or errors of pyrometry .",
    "furthermore , the measured melting data are in general agreement with our previous molecular dynamics simulations  @xcite and _ ab initio _ results by taioli",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite with the difference of around 1000 k. while , almost at the same time , in another new dac experiment ruiz - fuertesa _ et al .",
    "_ still obtained the same flat melting curve ,  @xcite in contrast with the dac results of dewaele _ et al . _",
    "@xcite    whether or not a solid - solid ( ss ) phase transition occurs before melting is key to understand the large discrepancies between dac and sw experiments , and those between different dac experiments .",
    "so , the ss transition in ta has been another attractive subject in recent years .",
    "theoretically , burakovsky _ et al . _ reported a phase transition from bcc to hexagonal omega ( hex-@xmath0 ) phase above 70 gpa based on first - principles simulations .",
    "@xcite they also believe that the previous dac melting data  @xcite are problematic , because the observed sample motion in dac experiments is very likely not due to melting but internal stresses accompanying a ss transition such as bcc-@xmath0 transition .",
    "@xcite in addition , in highly undercooled tantalum liquid jakse _ et al .",
    "_ observed another metastable structure , _ _",
    "a__15 , in the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "@xcite while , no ss phase transition was observed in the new dac experiment by dewaele _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite    on one hand , there is at least about 1000 k regime between the new dac data  @xcite and the theoretical predictions ,  @xcite where it is possible to occur ss phase transitions . on the other hand , the discontinuity in recent experimental shear sound velocities @xmath2 at @xmath160 gpa  @xcite and the softening of experimental and theoretical shear sound velocities",
    "@xcite have the obvious characteristics of ss phase transitions .",
    "furthermore , hsiung observed the displacive @xmath0 phase transition within the shock - recovered polycrystalline tantalum after being shocked to relatively lower pressure , 45 gpa .",
    "@xcite it was recently reported that the observed @xmath0 phase in the shock - recovered ta is not ideal hexagonal but pseudo - hexagonal .",
    "@xcite but what burakovsky  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported is the ideal @xmath0 phase .",
    "so , it is necessary to further explore the phase stability of ta at high pressure and high temperature ( hpht ) to understand the high - pressure melting discrepancies between different experiments .",
    "this motivates us to further investigate whether or not bcc - ta transit to other phase before melting .",
    "first , we globally searched the low - energy structures of ta using our recently developed _",
    "ab initio _ mac crystal structure prediction technique .",
    "then , the stability of the produced metastable structures was carefully checked .",
    "finally , the sound velocities of the stable and metastable structures were deduced from the calculated elastic constants and compared with experiments .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ compdet ] is the computational details .",
    "we present the results and discussion in section  [ results ] .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in section  [ concl ] .",
    "in order to determine the stable structures and alternative metastable structures for ta , we searched its low - energy structures from 0 to 300 gpa with the interval of 10 gpa using the mac crystal structure prediction technique as implemented in our muse code .",
    "the mac algorithm combines organically the multi algorithms including the evolutionary algorithm , the simulated annealing algorithm and the basin hopping algorithm to search collaboratively the global energy minima of materials with the fixed stoichiometry .",
    "@xcite after introduced the competition in all the evolutionary and variation operators , the evolution of the crystal population and the choice of the operators are self - adaptive automatically .",
    "that is to say the crystal population undergoes a self - adaptive evolution process .",
    "so , it can effectively find materials stable and metastable structures under certain conditions only provided the chemical information of the materials .",
    "@xcite more importantly , muse generates the random structures of the first generation with symmetry constraints , and then largely shortens the optimization time of the first generation and increase the diversity of crystal population .",
    "the random structures can be created according to the randomly chosen space group numbers from 2 to 230 and wyckoff positions must be fit to the atom - number ratio of different kinds .",
    "@xcite tests on systems including metallic , covalent and ionic systems all show that muse has very high efficiency and almost 100% success rate .",
    "the structures generated by the muse code were optimized by vasp package .",
    "@xcite we applied the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) parametrized by pbe  @xcite and the electron - ion interaction described by the paw scheme .",
    "@xcite the pseudopotential for ta has the valence electrons configuration of @xmath3 . to achieve good convergences the kinetic energy cutoff and the _ k_-point grids spacing",
    "were chosen to be 500 ev and 0.03 @xmath4 in the calculations , respectively .",
    "the accuracies of the target pressure and the energy convergence for all optimizations are better than 0.1 gpa and @xmath5 ev , respectively .",
    "the systems containing 4 , 8 and 16 atoms in the primitive cell were used in all the structure searches .",
    "the structures were generated with symmetry constraints and optimized at fixed pressure in our mac crystal structure searches .",
    "@xcite the enthalpies of these structures were calculated and compared to find the proper path towards the lowest - enthalpy structure .",
    "bcc has the lowest enthalpy among all the searched structures .",
    "it is interesting that we found an energetically competitive structure with the orthorhombic _ pnma _ symmetry ( space group : 62 ) .",
    "_ pnma_-ta has four atoms in its primitive cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pnma - ta ] ) .",
    "the four atoms are at wickoff s 4__c _ _ positions ( 0.132 , 0.250 , 0.366 ) with the lattice constants 4.98 , 4.30 and 2.56 @xmath6 at @xmath1100 gpa .",
    "this structure was then checked and confirmed by burakovsky .  @xcite it is noted that we also reproduced the previous reported _ pm@xmath7n _ ( _ _ a__15 )  @xcite and _ p6/mmm _ ( hex-@xmath0 )  @xcite structures whose energy are much higher than _ pnma _ structure .",
    "meanwhile , other produced structures of ta with space groups _ i4/mmm _ , _ c2/c _ , _ fddd _ and so on , were also found to have much higher energies than _ pnma_-ta .        in detail",
    ", we found that bcc is stable at pressure up to 300 gpa .",
    "the enthalpy differences of some low - enthalpy structures relative to bcc are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltah ] .",
    "we note that _ pnma_-ta has much lower enthalpies than the previously reported hex-@xmath0  @xcite and _ _ a__15  @xcite phases .",
    "but it has lower symmetry than hex-@xmath0 ( p6/mmm , 191 ) and _ _ a__15 ( _ pm@xmath7n _ , 223 ) .",
    "their enthalpy differences with respective to bcc are all positive and increase with pressure .",
    "this indicates that , at 0 k , bcc is the most stable phase and becomes more and more stable as pressure increases . while , it is probably not the case at elevated temperature and the _ pnma _ structure is expected to be more stable than bcc at hpht . after all , _",
    "pnma_-ta has much lower energy that hex-@xmath0 and _ _",
    "a__15 structures at high pressure .",
    "before we treat _ pnma _ structure as an alternative metastable phase of ta , we should check its stability at high pressure .      to test the dynamic stability of this candidate metastable structure",
    ", we calculated its phonon dispersion curve .",
    "we determined the vibrational frequencies of _ pnma_-ta using the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) ,  @xcite as implemented in the quantum - espresso package .  @xcite we used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) proposed by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite as the exchange - correlation functional . a nonlinear core correction to the exchange - correlation energy function",

    "as an example , the calculated phonon dispersion curve of _ pnma_-ta at 96 gpa was shown in fig .",

    "@xcite while at 100 gpa , the shear sound velocity begins the softening behavior , consistent with the ixs experiment ,  @xcite and it recovers at about 250 gpa .",
    "recently , hu _ et al .",
    "_ observed a discontinuation of hugoniot shear sound velocity @xmath2 at @xmath160 gpa , implying a ss phase transition under shock compression .",
    "@xcite our calculated 0 k bcc - ta sound velocities are in good agreement with their experimental data below 50 gpa . while , their experimental shear sound velocities have an abrupt decrease at about 60 gpa , implying a ss phase transition .",
    "our bcc - ta shear sound velocities have no such discontinuation at 60 gpa .",
    "but our shear sound velocities of _ pnma_-ta deviate from those of bcc - ta .",
    "it is interesting that our calculated shear sound velocities of _",
    "pnma_-ta reproduced the experimental discontinuation of shear sound velocities above 60 gpa . for bulk",
    "sound velocity @xmath19 , our calculated values of both bcc and _ pnma _ are in good agreement with experiments , respectively , and they have no discontinuation in the pressure range of interest .",
    "our shear sound velocities of _ pnma_-ta are also in good agreement with those of hu _ et al .",
    "_ this suggests that solid ta transits from bcc to _ pnma _ phase under shock compression .",
    "it is noted that both our calculated 0 k shear sound velocities of bcc - ta and the root temperature ixs data  @xcite show the elastic softening at 100 gpa , but the hugoniot shear sound velocities  @xcite have softening at 60 gpa .",
    "this is attributed to the effects of the high temperature and the shock shear stress , which lower the phase transition pressure .      in order to determine the mechanical stability of hex-@xmath0-ta , we also calculated its high - pressure elastic constants after full relaxation . for hexagonal lattices ,",
    "there are five independent elastic constants , i.e. @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we calculated the elastic constants as the second derivatives of the internal energy with respect to the strain tensor which leads to volume conserving lattice .",
    "the elastic constants were calculated at the equilibrium relaxed structure at fixed volume @xmath18 by keeping the strains in the lattice and relaxing the symmetry allowed internal degrees of freedom , and by finding the quadratic coefficients after fitting the forth - order polynomial curves to the total energies and strains .",
    "the method for reducing the five elastic constants is the same as that in ref .  .",

    "so , we should check the high - temperature stability of hex-@xmath0 phase from the high - temperature phonon dispersion .",
    "it was pointed that the mechanically unstable phase at 0 k can be stabilized by vibrational entropy of lattice at elevated temperature , i.e. the interactions between phonons .",
    "@xcite the harmonic phonon calculation methods , typically the frozen phonon method and the density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) ,  @xcite only treat with the 0 k lattice , despite that they can include the electronic temperature through the finite - temperature dft . in order to include the high - temperature lattice vibration",

    "the phonon frequencies are thus renormalized by the very same interaction.@xcite    the force calculations were performed with vasp ,  @xcite within gga parametrized by pbe .",
    "@xcite the electron - ion interactions were also described by the paw scheme  @xcite with the energy cutoff of 350 ev .",

    "after tests , the supercell was chosen to contain 54 atoms resulted from the @xmath41 replication of hex-@xmath0 unit cell .    in the scaild calculations ,",
    "the forces calculations are very demanding , and the high temperature phonon dispersion spectra were converged after more than 100 scaild loops .",

    "all the dispersion curves contain considerable imaginary frequencies in the acoustic branches , in agreement with the calculations of burakovsky _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and at high temperature the converged phonon dispersion curves still have considerable imaginary frequencies at pressures from 0 to 300 gpa and temperatures from 4000 to 7000 k. so according to the scaild theory , hex-@xmath0 phase is unstable at high temperature under compression .",
    "this does not support the previous theoretical predictions that bcc-@xmath0 transition occurs before melting above 70 gpa .",
    "@xcite      from our elastic constants and high - temperature phonon dispersion curves , we see that the ideal hex-@xmath0 phase is not stable at 0 k and elevated temperature under high pressure .",
    "furthermore , the hex-@xmath0 phase is not energetically competitive compared with the _ pnma _ structure according to our structure searches .",
    "however , what hsiung observed in the recent experiment is the pseudo - hex-@xmath0 with fractional coordinates : ( 0,0,0 ) , ( 2.056/3,0.944/3,1/2 ) , and ( 0.944/3,2.056/3,1/2 ) .",

    "the high - temperature phonon dispersion curves of hex-@xmath0 ta also show considerable imaginary frequencies , suggesting it is not dynamically stable .",
    "the negative shear moduli @xmath24 of hex-@xmath0 ta reflected its mechanical instability .",
    "why the pseudo - hex-@xmath0 structure is stable and observed in experiment is probably because of the existence of impurities such as w atoms  @xcite in the samples .",
    "w atoms prevent ta atoms from moving to their ideal equilibrium positions in hexagonal lattice .    from the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of ta , wu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found that shear induces bcc to transit to a viscous plastic flow ( partially disordered , partially crystalline structure ) before melting .",
    "so they argued that this transition was misinterpreted as melting in previous dac  @xcite experiments due to the similarity of the plastic flow to liquid .",
    "the substantial elastic softening and the discontinuities of the hugoniot shear sound velocities  @xcite and the shear sound speed at room temperature  @xcite of the bcc phase imply the ss phase transition in solid ta . just as klug reviewed , possible additional phases except @xmath0 may complicate the measurement of the melting point and the pyrometric techniques also have space to improve .",
    "@xcite the additional phases with very low symmetries resemble the local structure in the liquid phase .",
    "so , the transformations from bcc to such low symmetry phases bring the difficulties to identify the occurrence of melting in experiments .",
    "our predicted new phase with _",
    "low symmetry is expected to be the phase to which bcc transits before melting .",
    "in conclusion , in order to find low - energy structures of ta at high pressure , we globally searched the structures for pure ta from 0 to 300 gpa using the _ ab initio _ mac crystal structure prediction technique .",
