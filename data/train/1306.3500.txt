    "agn outflows appear to be a substantial component of the nuclear environment , and their ubiquity suggests that mass ejection is probably linked to or even required for mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "for example , outflows could provide a mechanism for expelling angular momentum from the accreting material ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , outflows in luminous agns may play an important role in the feedback of smbhs into typical massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the outflowing material could drive away sufficient gas from the host galaxy to quench both star formation and smbh growth , leading to the observed relations between the mass of the smbh and the properties of the galaxy bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the strongest observational signature of outflows from luminous agns ( i.e. , quasars ) is broad absorption lines ( bals ; @xcite ) in the ultraviolet ( uv ) ; these are seen in of optically selected quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "aside from dust reddening , bal quasars generally have indistinguishable continuum spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from non - bal quasars from the infrared ( ir ) to the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that all / most quasars have bal winds , with bals being observed only when inclination angles are large and the line of sight passes through the outflowing wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "is the average value .",
    "quasars with winds having larger covering factors would have larger chances of being observed as bal quasars . ]",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that bal quasars represent an early evolutionary stage of quasars and/or the appearance as a bal quasar might be related to the duty cycle of smbh growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a promising scenario for bal quasar outflows is the accretion - disk wind model , where the wind is launched from the disk at @xmath910@xmath10  cm and is radiatively driven by uv line pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig - art ] is a schematic illustration of the model .",
    "uv absorption - line profiles predicted by this model are consistent with observations of bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since line - driving becomes less efficient when the ionization state of the gas is too high , the disk - wind model has invoked `` shielding '' material to prevent the wind from being overionized by the extreme uv ( euv ) and soft radiation from the innermost accretion disk and its corona .",
    "one proposed origin for the shielding gas is a `` failed wind '' , which is located at the base of the uv - absorbing wind and consists of material that does not reach escape velocity due to overionization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detailed geometry of the shielding gas is still uncertain ( e.g. , it could also perhaps `` hug '' the uv - absorbing wind ) .",
    "10@xmath10  cm and is driven by uv radiation from the disk .",
    "bals are observed when the line of sight passes through the outflowing wind .",
    "the shielding gas located at the base of the wind blocks the euv and x - ray radiation from the nucleus and prevents the wind from being overionized .",
    "one origin for the shielding gas could be a `` failed wind '' ; the small arrows in this gas represent the velocity field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for a standard accretion disk , the disk region that emits most strongly in the uv has a radius @xmath11  cm ; see section  [ sec - physicalimp ] below .",
    "[ fig - art ] ]    under the above scenario , agns with observable disk winds would appear x - ray weak due to absorption by the shielding gas . indeed , bal quasars are in general weak , and absorption is often seen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the observed weakness of bal quasars is correlated with the absorption strength and maximum velocity of the uv bals ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the shielding gas does play a role in shaping the properties of the uv wind .",
    "the absorption in bal quasars often appears complex ( i.e. , not just a simple photoelectric absorption cutoff but an ionized or partially covering absorber ) ; the measured absorption column densities ( @xmath12 ) are typically in the range of @xmath13 to @xmath14  @xmath3 , although absorption constraints usually have significant uncertainties due to limited photon statistics and poorly constrained absorption complexity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray absorption variability has been observed in a few bal quasars on timescales of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that the shielding gas can be a dynamical structure subject to rotational and outflow / inflow motions , but the details of the dynamics remain unclear .",
    "significant flux variability has also been seen in a few objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , when compared with the quasar population in general , bal quasars do not show exceptional variability @xcite .",
    "overall , the nature of the shielding gas in bal quasars remains poorly constrained .    with the current spectra of bal quasars observed by _",
    "asca _ , _ chandra _ , or _",
    "xmm - newton _ , the absorption column density can be constrained up to @xmath15  @xmath3 . at higher column densities ,",
    "even photons at energies of  kev are severely absorbed , and the observed spectra may be dominated by a scattered / reflected component .",
    "it is thus difficult to determine the absorption properties for heavily obscured ( @xmath16  @xmath3 ) or compton - thick ( @xmath17  @xmath3 ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) objects . supplemented with multiwavelength data ,",
    "the level of weakness can be estimated by comparing the seds of bal quasars to those of typical quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "specifically , in such comparisons the power - law slope parameter ( @xmath18 ) is often used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is a measure of the soft ( 2  kev ) luminosity of a quasar relative to its optical / uv luminosity .",
    "this parameter is known to be correlated with the 2500    monochromatic luminosity ( @xmath19 ) of the quasar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus @xmath20 , defined as the difference between the observed @xmath18 and the one expected from @xmath19 ( @xmath21 ) , indicates the level weakness of the source .    for many bal quasars , the observed weakness can be attributed entirely to absorption .",
    "it is clear that their photons have penetrated the obscuring material , and , after correcting for the moderate absorption , their fluxes recover to nominal levels ( ) . in these cases , the absorption - corrected 2  kev flux , and thus @xmath22 and @xmath23 , are generally estimated assuming a power - law spectrum ( e.g. , with a nominal photon index @xmath24 ) and normalizing it to the hard ( e.g. , rest - frame @xmath25  kev ) continuum ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for some of the sources with better spectra , absorption corrections can be derived directly via spectral fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has also been found that the effective photon index determined from hardness ratios is correlated with the level of x - ray weakness ( @xmath20 ) , i.e. , x - ray weaker sources are harder , suggesting that absorption plays an important role in causing the x - ray weakness of the general bal quasar population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , some bal quasars show significant weakness which can not be accounted for by the _",
    "apparent _ x - ray absorption determined using @xmath26  kev data . in these cases",
    "the continuum levels are still factors of lower than the expected sed levels after absorption corrections ( @xmath27 to @xmath28 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the x - ray weakness for such objects is uncertain .",
    "it is possible that they are heavily obscured , and the observed spectra are dominated by the scattered / reflected component .",
    "alternatively , these objects could be intrinsically weak compared to typical quasars , not emitting at a nominal level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an example of a mechanism that could cause intrinsic weakness is wind quenching of the accretion - disk corona , as proposed by @xcite , where the coronal x - ray emission is suppressed when the failed disk wind falls into the corona and makes it `` too dense , too opaque , and consequently too cold '' .",
    "a few bal quasars have been suggested to have compton - thick absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies are based on the weak / non detection of the source in the x - ray band , making detailed spectral analysis infeasible .",
    "therefore the scenario of intrinsic weakness can not be excluded .",
    "an open question is whether even stronger absorption could be present in weak bal quasars , or if instead some of these quasars are actually intrinsically weak .",
    "one way to address this is to observe at higher energies where the are considerably more penetrating .",
    "for example , the _ bepposax _ observation of the bal quasar mrk  231 revealed an absorption column density of @xmath29  @xmath3 , with only the @xmath3050  kev x - rays observed by _ bepposax _",
    "able to penetrate the obscuring gas @xcite ; this discovery was later apparently confirmed by the _ suzaku _",
    "data in the  kev band @xcite . with the successful launch of the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ ; @xcite ) on 2012 jun 13 , it is possible to investigate this question systematically .",
    "_ nustar _  is the first focusing telescope in orbit observing in the hard x - ray band ; it provides about two orders - of - magnitude improvement in @xmath31  kev sensitivity over previous hard missions , as well as accurate source positions ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "survey of significantly weak bal quasars can detect penetrating the absorber at @xmath31  kev unless the absorber is very compton - thick , and thereby better constrain the nature of the shielding gas and the disk - wind mechanism .      as a pilot program , we selected two well studied bal quasars , pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 , that appear weak and observed them with _ nustar_. we selected these two targets from the 87 palomar - green ( pg ) quasars @xcite at @xmath33 .",

    "for our purpose of constraining the basic absorption column density in these bal quasars , the model is likely also applicable to ionized material , as high - energy attenuation is dominated by compton scattering ( not photoelectric absorption ) in the compton - thick regime .",

    "if the observed emission has contributions from additional continuum components that were not considered in the mytorus modeling , our estimation of the column density above would likely be an underestimate as the scattered / reflected component associated with the absorber would be weaker than the observed emission .",

    "therefore , a bal quasar may be compton - thick but without a strong fe  k@xmath5 line due to highly ionized compton - thick absorption , although it would appear difficult to ionize highly a compton - thick medium due to the effects of compton scattering ( e.g. , see section 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the strong narrow fe k@xmath5 line could be affected by line broadening ( or smeared out in the extreme case ) if the absorber / reflector has outflow motion and consists of multiple velocity components . while the kinematics of the absorbing component of the disk wind are still uncertain , broadening and shifting of the fe k@xmath5 emission line has perhaps been seen in bal quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider these explanations less likely than jet - linked dilution but still possible .",
    "of course , it is also possible that pg  1004 + 130 is not compton - thick and thus does not have a prominent fe k@xmath5 line feature . in this case",
    ", it would not produce emission as typical quasars do and would be intrinsically weak , as discussed in the next subsection .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the best - studied cases is the narrow - line type 1 quasar phl 1811 , which is rapidly variable by a high amplitude but always appears weak and shows no evidence for intrinsic absorption @xcite .",
    "a systematic survey for such intrinsically weak quasars demonstrated that these objects are rare in optically selected ( non - bal ) quasar samples ; the fraction of sdss quasars with @xmath146 is @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "many bal quasars are weak due to absorption ( see section 1.1 ) , and thus they are often excluded in searches for intrinsically weak quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , intrinsic weakness is in fact an attractive possibility to account for the bal nature in the disk - wind scenario . as introduced in section  1.1 , to launch successfully a wind through the uv line - driving mechanism , the soft emission from the nucleus must be shielded to prevent the wind from being overionized .",
    "if the nucleus were incapable of producing strong emission , the wind could be launched with little / no shielding , and then a bal quasar would be observed if the viewing angle were appropriate .",
    "it is clear that some bal quasars do emit at a nominal level as their fluxes recover to expected levels after absorption corrections ( see section 1.1 ) .",
    "however , there are other bal quasars , including pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 , that still appear weak after basic absorption corrections ; these are candidates for being intrinsically weak quasars .",
    "the nature of intrinsic weakness remains unclear .",
    "possible explanations generally invoke mechanisms that weaken or destroy the emitting accretion - disk corona ( see , e.g. , the discussions in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one specific mechanism relevant to bal quasars was proposed by @xcite , who suggested that part of the accretion - disk outflow ( i.e. , a dense , highly ionized `` failed wind '' produced by overionization ) could fall into ( see figure  1 for the velocity field ) the corona and thereby suppress its emission . with the presence of dense gas from the outflow ,",
    "the coronal magnetic field becomes insufficient to liberate and transport energy from the disk to heat the corona via magnetized bubbles , and also relativistic electrons in the corona will cool efficiently via bremsstrahlung instead of inverse - compton radiation ( bremsstrahlung is less effective in making hard x - rays ) .",
    "we caution that the natures of both the `` failed wind '' and the corona remain uncertain , and therefore there are inevitable uncertainties associated with the interaction of these two components    considering the modeled dynamical nature of the outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the above coronal - quenching model , we suggest that there may even be a cyclical mechanism that switches on / off the coronal emission : after the quenching of the coronal emission , the wind can be successfully launched and there will be no `` failed wind '' falling into the corona ; the corona thus recovers to a standard emitting mode , and overionizes the inner portion of wind which will then again fall into the corona and suppress its emission .",
    "the outflow is expected to settle down to a steady state over a timescale of years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus we might expect the above mechanism to operate over a timescale of years or longer .",
    "such a cyclical mechanism could be used to explain why some bal quasars are normal ( after absorption corrections ) and some are perhaps intrinsically weak , and it may be responsible for the significant flux and spectral variability observed in some bal quasars ( e.g. , pg  2112 + 059 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "if bal winds exist in all / most quasars , such a mechanism could also be responsible for the strong variability seen from some non - bal quasars when they have entered weak states due to quenched coronal emission ( e.g. , phl 1092 ; * ? ? ?",
    "pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 appear to have some intrinsic absorption regardless of whether they are intrinsically weak . for pg  1004 + 130 ,",
    "the column density derived from spectral modeling is @xmath86  @xmath3 ( see section  [ sec - spec ] ) . for pg  1700 + 518 ,",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ data reveal a column density of a few @xmath148  @xmath3 @xcite ; significant absorption is also indicated by the small effective photon index ( @xmath149 ) derived using the _ nustar _  band ratio ( see section  [ sec - pho ] ) . within the above coronal - quenching mechanism",
    ", the apparent absorption could still be attributed to the shielding gas in bal quasars as there may be a period when the coronal emission is quenched while the shielding gas has not fully disappeared .",
    "the values of @xmath20 are both @xmath150 for these two bal quasars after corrections for apparent absorption @xcite , indicating that they are @xmath151 times intrinsically weaker than expected .",
    "intrinsic weakness would naturally explain the lack of a strong fe k@xmath5 line in pg  1004 + 130 , as the observed x - ray spectra are not scattering / reflection dominated . for the radio - loud object ,",
    "pg  1004 + 130 , the intrinsic weakness scenario implies that the radio jet does not produce emission at a nominal level either ( @xmath1 times weaker ) .",
    "although unusual , a small fraction of radio - loud quasars appear to be providing little / no excess emission compared to their radio - quiet counterparts ( see , e.g. , figure 7 of * ? ? ?",
    "the likely large inclination angle of pg  1004 + 130 ( @xmath152 ; e.g. , @xcite ) could be one factor that reduces the observed x - ray emission compared to other radio - loud quasars due to a lack of relativistic beaming .",
    "intrinsic weakness in quasars may affect the appearance of the optical  uv emission lines by modifying the photoionization properties of the emission - line region .",
    "phl  1811 , for example , has unusual line emission : its high - ionization lines ( e.g. ,  @xmath98 and  @xmath153 ) are very weak , there is no evidence for forbidden or semiforbidden lines ( e.g. , [ ]  @xmath154 ) , and the and pseudo - continuum in the near - uv is very strong @xcite .",
    "the phl 1811 analogs investigated by @xcite have similar emission - line properties and are also weak quasar candidates .",
    "such unusual emission lines can probably be attributed to a soft ionizing continuum ( uv nominal but weak ; e.g. , @xcite ) . for pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 , the  @xmath98 and  @xmath153 lines",
    "are strongly absorbed due to their bal nature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rendering reliable line - strength measurements impossible .",
    "pg  1004 + 130 shows normal [ ]  @xmath154 emission ; pg  1700 + 518 is a narrow - line type 1 quasar ( as for phl 1811 ) and shows no visible [ ]  @xmath154 line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "their optical emission - line properties in general do not appear unusual compared to other pg quasars when considering `` eigenvector 1 '' correlations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult to determine if pg  1004 + 130 and pg  1700 + 518 share the same usual emission - line properties as phl 1811 when the weakness of their high - ionization lines can not be constrained .",
    "however , even if they have generally normal line emission , the intrinsic weakness scenario may still work , based on the following consideration . for a typical quasar ,",
    "the ionizing continuum is dominated by euv emission , which is largely unobservable and is often estimated via interpolating the uv and photometric data points assuming a power - law spectrum ( e.g. , see the composite quasar seds in figure  [ fig - sed ] ; also adopted in @xcite ) .",
    "the coronal - quenching mechanism discussed above could perhaps mainly reduce the @xmath155  kev emission while leaving the euv radiation from the accretion disk largely the same .",
    "although the significantly weakened emission would certainly affect the ionization state of the emission - line region somewhat , it is possible that the appearance of the emission lines is affected less dramatically due to ionization from euv photons ; further photoionization calculations of emission lines are required to assess this in detail .          motivated by our _ nustar _  results , we derived basic statistical constraints upon the fraction of intrinsically weak bal quasars from the relatively well - studied large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) bal quasar sample in @xcite . these are distant bal quasars at @xmath343 ; at their mean redshift of @xmath156 , the 0.58  kev _ chandra _  observations are probing the rest - frame @xmath13724  kev band , close to the hard band observed by _",

    "only six objects have @xmath18 values in the expected range for typical quasars ( dark - shaded region ) .",
    "however , after absorption corrections , 15 additional objects have @xmath22 values within the expected range ( light - shaded region ) , indicating that they probably have nominal underlying x - ray emission . there are four objects below the light - shaded region ( two measurements and two upper limits ) , and another ten in the light - shaded region have upper limits on @xmath22 .",

    "it appears that the stacked source is a candidate for being intrinsically x - ray weak , as it is close to the slanted dashed line in the unshaded region ( having a fairly soft x - ray spectrum and being x - ray weak ) . as a first - order estimate",
    ", we consider that about half ( six ) of the 12 quasars being stacked are probably softer ( @xmath169 ) than the stacked signal , and the other half are harder ( @xmath170 ) .",

    "if non - bal quasars also have bal winds lying out of the line of sight ( see section  1.1 ) , the significant difference in the fractions would suggest that intrinsically weak quasars are preferentially seen as bal quasars .",
    "one possible scenario is that although the average covering factor of the bal wind is @xmath8 ( see section  1.1 ) , the wind in an intrinsically weak quasar has a considerably larger covering factor , as it is likely easier to launch the wind when the nuclear x - ray emission is weak .",
