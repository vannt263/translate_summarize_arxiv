    "in the 1970s works by penrose and ammann showed that the euclidean space can be filled gapless and non - overlapping by two or more tiles which are arranged in a nonperiodic way according to matching rules @xcite .",
    "these quasiperiodic tilings showed a hierarchical structure and long - range oriental order .",
    "the study of such tilings was strongly intensified after the discovery of quasicrystals by shechtman et al .  in 1982",
    "these materials are characterized by a perfect long range order without having a three - dimensional translational periodicity .",
    "the former is manifested by the occurrence of sharp spots in the diffraction pattern and the latter in the occurrence of rotational symmetries forbidden for conventional crystals @xcite .",
    "while the diffractions patterns of quasicrystals were not explainable by the structure of crystals with their periodic repetition of unit cells , the mathematical concept of quasiperiodic tilings was suitable to describe the structure of this new material class @xcite .",
    "various experimental investigations revealed rather exotic physical properties .",
    "for instance quasicrystalline surfaces are anti - adhesive in combination with a high level of hardness making them suitable for the production of coatings of cookware , engines , tools , etc . @xcite .",
    "further , they possess a rather low thermal and electrical conductance although they contain a high amount of well - conducting elements @xcite . this motivated extensive research to obtain a better theoretical understanding of the structure and the physical properties of these materials .",
    "today several exact results are known for one - dimensional quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "however , the characteristics in two or three dimensions have been clarified to a much lesser degree and are mainly based on numerical studies . due to the lack of translation symmetry in quasicrystals , one has to study very large approximants to obtain an insight into the physical properties of macroscopic quasicrystals .",
    "in addition many physical properties in quasiperiodic systems show a power - law behaviour with respect to time or system size , which indicates the absence of a typical time / length scale in the system . that behavior is in correspondence with the self - similarity of quasicrystalline structures , what allows scaling between the various hierarchic levels of the tilings .",
    "the resulting scaling exponents provide an insight into the properties of the macroscopic systems .",
    "such a scaling approach was also used for the numerical determination of the electronic properties for the penrose tiling , the ammann - kramer - neri tiling , or octagonal tiling models @xcite .",
    "however , all these calculations were performed for relatively small systems , making it difficult to determine the exact scaling behaviour .    to obtain a better insight into the properties of quantum - mechanical wave functions and the quantum diffusion in quasicrystals , we study here models of @xmath0-dimensional quasicrystals with a separable hamiltonian in a tight - binding approach @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the fibonacci sequences , which describes the weak and strong couplings of atoms in a quasiperiodic chain .",
    "the fibonacci chain is the one - dimensional analogue of the penrose tiling and the icosahedral quasicrystal @xcite and , hence , it is related to quasicrystals with five - fold and ten - fold rotational symmetries .",
    "our higher - dimensional tilings are then constructed as a direct product of these chains .",
    "also the eigenstates of these tilings can be directly calculated by multiplying the wave functions and by adding / multiplying the energies of the quasiperiodic chains , which yields the hypercubic tiling or the labyrinth tiling , respectively .",
    "this approach allows us to study very large systems with up to @xmath1 sites in three dimensions based on the solutions in one dimension .    the quantum diffusion in the fibonacci chain and the corresponding hypercubic tiling has been studied quite intensively in the past @xcite .",
    "further , in our previous work we obtained more insight into the electronic eigenstates and the transport properties of the labyrinth tiling .",
    "for instance , we showed that the product structure of the labyrinth tiling leads to a connection of the multifractal properties of the wave functions in different dimensions @xcite . in recent years also some new properties for one - dimensional quasiperiodic chains were found .",
    "these include the step - like behaviour of the wave - packet dynamics of metallic - mean chains reported by us @xcite and the discovery of log - time - periodic oscillations of wave packets in the fibonacci chain @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report new results for the multifractal properties of wave functions in quasiperiodic systems and for the return probability of the wave packets .",
    "in particular , we study the participation numbers which provide an insight into the distribution of the probability density of electronic wave functions and allow us to distinguish extended and localized states .",
    "this can be related to the electronic transport properties , because e.g.  bloch functions indicate ballistic transport and localized wave functions are associated with insulators . to describe the electronic transport properties more quantitatively two quantities",
    "are usually studied : the mean square displacement and the temporal autocorrelation function .",
    "the scaling exponent @xmath2 of the mean square displacement is connected to the electrical conductivity of a quasicrystal according to the generalized drude equation @xcite . in our recent work",
    "we showed that the scaling exponent @xmath2 can be determined analytically for the labyrinth tiling in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation by a renormalization group ( rg ) approach @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the temporal autocorrelation function , which is directly related to the properties of the ( local ) density of states .",
    "further , it describes the decay of the wave packet which can be linked to the quantum diffusion of electrons in the system .",
    "we also show that for systems with absolute continuous energy spectra an improved lower bound for the exponent @xmath2 can be obtained , which is not restricted to the systems studied here .",
    "the paper is structured in the following way . in sec .  [",
    "sec : state - of - art ] we briefly describe the construction rules for the @xmath0-dimensional separable tilings .",
    "we also introduce the participation numbers and the temporal autocorrelation function and give an overview of known results for these quantities in quasiperiodic systems . in section [ sec : rg - approach ] we briefly describe the rg approach , which is applied in the following two sections .",
    "this is followed by the presentation of new results for the properties of the wave functions in these systems in sec .",

    "we also apply the rg approach to show that the wave functions do not become localized even for very small coupling strengths . in sec .",
    "[ sec : returnprob ] we study the wave - packet dynamics with a special focus on the return probability with numerical methods and with the rg approach .",
    "further , the lower bounds for the scaling exponent @xmath2 of the mean square displacement are discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the construction of the separable quasiperiodic tilings is based on the fibonacci chain defined by the inflation rule @xmath3 . starting with the symbol",

    "thus , we obtain with the continued fraction representation @xmath14 = [ 1,1,1, ... ]$ ] the relations @xmath15    our model describes an electron hopping from one vertex of a quasiperiodic chain to a neighboring one .",
    "the aperiodicity is given by the underlying quasiperiodic sequence of couplings , where the symbols @xmath11 and @xmath4 denote the weak and strong bonds of the chain .",
    "solving the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath16 for the fibonacci chain with zero on - site potentials , we obtain discrete energy values @xmath17 and wave functions @xmath18 represented in the orthogonal basis states @xmath19 associated to a vertex @xmath20 .",
    "if not stated differently we use free boundary conditions , which yields @xmath21 eigenstates .",
    "the hopping strength @xmath22 in the schrdinger equation is given by the fibonacci sequence @xmath6 with @xmath23 for a strong bond and @xmath24 for a weak bond ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "for @xmath26 only isolated clusters of single vertices or two strongly coupled vertices occur , and for @xmath27 the system is periodic .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional separable quasiperiodic tilings are then constructed from the product of @xmath0 quasiperiodic chains which are perpendicular to each other . for this setup",
    "two special cases are known for which the systems become separable @xcite :    _ hypercubic tiling @xmath28 _",
    " this tiling corresponds to the usual euclidean product of @xmath0 linear quasiperiodic chains , i.e. , only vertices connected by vertical and horizontal bonds interact as shown in figure [ fig : tilings ] .",
    "such a tiling is referred to as a square tiling in two dimensions and in general as a hypercubic tiling @xcite . in literature",
    "this model has been studied mainly for the fibonacci sequence @xcite , and for reasons of comparison we will also present a few results of this model .    _",
    "labyrinth tiling @xmath29 _  in the other case only coupling terms to neighbours along the diagonal bonds are considered ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : tilings ] ) , where the bond strengths of this tiling equal the product of the corresponding bond strengths of the one - dimensional chains .",
    "the resulting grid is denoted as labyrinth tiling .",

    "thus , the eigenstates of the tilings in @xmath0 dimensions can be constructed from the eigenstates of @xmath0 one - dimensional chains . in both cases",
    "the wave functions of the higher - dimensional tiling are constructed as the product of the one - dimensional wave functions , i.e. , @xmath32 the superscripts @xmath33 enumerate the eigenvalues @xmath34 , and the subscript @xmath35 represents the coordinates of the vertices in the quasiperiodic tiling .",
    "however , the energies are treated in a different way for the two cases . in @xmath0 dimensions",
    "the eigenenergies are given by @xmath36 for the hypercubic tiling and by @xmath37 for the labyrinth tiling .",
    "while for the hypercubic tiling all combinations of the indices @xmath38 are allowed , for the labyrinth tiling only certain sets yield the correct solution due to symmetries of the eigenfunctions @xcite .      for the one - dimensional quasiperiodic systems the energy spectrum is known to be singular continuous @xcite .",
    "the properties of the energy spectrum for the hypercubic tiling and the labyrinth tiling can be obtained from studying the scaling behaviour of the width of the energy bands @xcite .",
    "the numerical results for both tilings provided evidence for a transition from a singular continuous to an absolutely continuous energy spectrum upon increasing the coupling parameter @xmath11 including an intermediate region where both parts coexist @xcite .",
    "the transition parameters depend on the dimension and the underlying quasiperiodic structure . in particular , we like to point out the threshold values @xmath39 in two dimensions and @xmath40 in three dimensions above which the spectrum of the hypercubic tiling and the labyrinth tiling becomes absolutely continuous @xcite .",
    "these transition parameters @xmath41 seem to correspond to the threshold values @xmath42 for which the density of states becomes gapless in two and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath26 the isolated clusters lead to a pure point spectrum and the periodic systems for @xmath43 possess an absolutely continuous spectrum regardless of the dimension .",
    "further , it was shown analytically that the energy spectrum of the square tiling is singular continuous in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation @xcite .",
    "another interesting property is that the energy spectrum of the fibonacci chain splits into ( sub)bands , which can be described by an rg approach proposed by niu and nori @xcite .",
    "we use this property later to derive a relation between the structure and the properties of the electronic wave function .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : wavefunctions ] we study the multifractal properties of the wave functions in fibonacci chains and the labyrinth tiling .",
    "this includes the computation of the participation ratio @xmath44 , which reflects the fraction of the total number of sites for which the probability measure of the wave function @xmath45 is significantly different from zero .",
    "hence , it provides information about the degree of localization of the wave function @xmath46 @xcite . for the discrete positions @xmath47 the participation ratio is defined via the inverse participation number @xmath48 of a wave function @xmath46 and the number of sites",

    "the participation ratio @xmath52 of a state @xmath53 was found to scale with a power law with respect to the number of sites @xmath49 , where the exponent @xmath54 is connected to the nature of this eigenstate @xcite .",
    "the wave function of a localized state is characterized by a scaling exponent @xmath55 , and @xmath56 corresponds to an extended state .",
    "intermediate values of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) indicate fractal eigenstates , which are neither extended over the whole system nor completely localized at a certain position and show self - similar patterns @xcite .",
    "the participation ratios within a small energy interval usually fluctuate over a certain range , but the participation ratios and the inverse participation numbers as well as the corresponding scaling exponents do not show any significant trend over the whole energy spectrum for the systems considered here @xcite .",
    "while the eigenstates of purely periodic systems can be characterized by a single scaling exponent @xmath59 , the wave functions of chaotic systems and quasicrystals are usually multifractals @xcite . the generalized dimensions @xmath60 describe the nature of the multifractality of the eigenstates , where @xmath60 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath61 .",
    "the dimension @xmath62 is equal to the capacity dimension , which can be understood as the box counting dimension here , @xmath63 is equal to the information dimension , and @xmath64 to the correlation dimension .",
    "the generalized dimensions can be determined either via the generalized inverse participation numbers or via a multifractal analysis .",

    "we measure the probability to find the electron in this particular box , i.e. , we study the spatial distribution of the wave functions .",
    "hence , for an eigenstate @xmath70 we determine the probability @xmath71 and then compute the mass exponent @xmath72 by a least squares fit of the quantity @xmath73 versus @xmath74 considering box sizes from @xmath75 @xcite .",

    "it is possible to improve the quality of the results by adapting the multifractal analysis to work also for non - integer fractions @xmath77 and by averaging over different initial positions of the boxes @xcite .",
    "however , we do not apply this improved method because it requires significantly more computing time .",
    "we also found that the simple partitioning scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the determination of the mass exponents .",
    "the generalized dimensions @xmath60 are easily obtained from the mass exponents according to the relation @xmath78 .      in the second part of the paper",
    "we investigate the dynamics of the quasiperiodic systems by means of the time evolution of a wave packet @xmath79 , which is constructed from the solutions @xmath80 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation obtained by the separation approach .",
    "the wave packet is then represented as a superposition of these orthonormal eigenstates @xmath81 @xcite , where we assume that it is initially localized at the position @xmath82 of the quasiperiodic tiling , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "hence , with the completeness relation and normalized basis states the wave packet is defined by @xmath84    for a wave packet @xmath85 initially localized at the position @xmath82 the temporal autocorrelation function @xcite @xmath86 corresponds to the integrated probability to be at the position @xmath82 up to time @xmath87 , i.e. , @xmath88 here , we denote the integrand as return probability @xmath89 , i.e. , @xmath90    the autocorrelation function for an infinite system is expected to decay with a power law @xmath91 for @xmath92 @xcite , where the scaling exponent @xmath93 depends on the initial position @xmath82 of the wave packet .",
    "further , it is known that the scaling exponent @xmath93 is equivalent to the correlation dimension @xmath94 of the local density of states @xmath95 of a system @xcite . due to this equivalence",
    "we can distinguish two limit cases and their associated spectral properties .",

    "a pure point spectrum implies @xmath96 , but the opposite statement may not be true @xcite . in one dimension",
    "@xmath97 corresponds to the ballistic motion of an electron , where the electron moves freely on the chain without scattering @xcite . in two and three dimensions",
    "@xmath97 usually does not indicate ballistic transport .",
    "further , an absolutely continuous spectrum implies @xmath97 but again the reverse is not necessarily true @xcite . for quasiperiodic structures one often obtains intermediate values of @xmath98 , i.e. , @xmath99 , which is related to the singular continuous energy spectrum @xcite .    to provide a better insight into the dynamical properties and to compare the properties of different systems , we average the results over different initial positions of the wave packet , i.e. , we investigate the scaling behaviour of @xmath100 .",
    "previous studies mostly use non - averaged data , which do not adequately display the macroscopic transport properties @xcite . due to restrictions in computing time",
    "we can not consider all possible initial positions @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , for the fibonacci chain we have chosen the 500 positions nearest to the center of the chain and in two and three dimensions we have randomly selected 100 vertices in a square of linear size 25 and a cube of linear size 15 around the center of the tilings .",

    ", the time - evolution operator becomes separable .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the wave packets in higher dimensions are much better understood than for the labyrinth tiling .",
    "they were able to show that @xmath101 and that the scaling behaviour of the temporal autocorrelation function is given by @xcite @xmath102 further , they found that for the limit case @xmath27 one always obtains @xmath103 . with the same arguments ,",
    "also the threshold values for the transition to an absolutely continuous energy spectrum can be directly obtained from the one - dimensional scaling exponents @xmath104 according to @xmath105 .",
    "in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation it is possible to relate the energy spectra and the wave functions of different approximants of the fibonacci chain by an rg approach proposed by niu and nori @xcite .",

    "[ sec : returnprob ] we also apply the rg approach to find a relation between the quasiperiodic structure of the fibonacci chain and its return probability .",
    "the general idea is that a given system can be transformed ( renormalized ) by the application of an rg step in such a way that we obtain a new system with a reduced number of degrees of freedom ( i.e. sites / bonds ) . in particular , for the fibonacci chain for @xmath107 the isolated sites ( atoms ) and biatomic clusters ( molecules ) coupled by a strong bond are visualized in figure [ fig : rg - fib ] .",

    "<S> we study the properties of wave functions and the wave - packet dynamics in quasiperiodic tight - binding models in one , two , and three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms in the one - dimensional quasiperiodic chains are coupled by weak and strong bonds aligned according to the fibonacci sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the associated @xmath0-dimensional quasiperiodic tilings are constructed from the direct product of @xmath0 such chains , which yields either the hypercubic tiling or the labyrinth tiling . </S>",
    "<S> this approach allows us to consider rather large systems numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the wave functions of the system are multifractal and that their properties can be related to the structure of the system in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation by a renormalization group ( rg ) approach . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the dynamics of wave packets to get information about the electronic transport properties . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we investigate the scaling behaviour of the return probability of the wave packet with time . applying again the rg approach </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the regime of strong quasiperiodic modulation the return probability is governed by the underlying quasiperiodic structure . </S>",
    "<S> further , we also discuss lower bounds for the scaling exponent of the width of the wave packet and propose a modified lower bound for the absolute continuous regime . </S>"
