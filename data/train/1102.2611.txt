    "heavy quark production in high - energy hadronic collisions has been a focus of interest for years .",
    "it is one of the few instances in which experimental measurements can be compared with qcd predictions over nearly the entire kinematical range  @xcite . due to the large masses of charm and bottom quarks ,",
    "they are produced almost exclusively during the initial high - q parton - parton interactions and thus can be described by perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "measurement of heavy flavor production in elementary collisions represents a crucial test of the validity of the current theoretical framework and its phenomenological inputs .",
    "it is also mandatory as a baseline for the interpretation of heavy flavor production in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite . in these heavy - ion collisions",
    "one investigates the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , which is created at sufficiently high center - of - mass energies .",
    "many effects on heavy flavor production in heavy - ion collisions have been observed but are quantitatively not yet fully understood  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are effects which modify the transverse momentum spectra of heavy flavor hadrons , including energy loss in the qgp ( `` jet quenching '' )  @xcite , as well as collective effects such as elliptic flow  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath12 might be regenerated in a dense plasma from the initial open charm yield  @xcite , making precise measurements of the transverse momentum spectra in elementary @xmath2+@xmath2 collisions imperative .",
    "open heavy - flavor production in , , and   collisions at @xmath13 = 200 gev has been studied at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) using a variety of final - state observables  @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration measured charm mesons directly through their hadronic decay channels  @xcite . due to the lack of precise secondary vertex tracking and trigger capabilities these measurements are restricted to low momenta ( @xmath14 gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "both star  @xcite and phenix  @xcite also measured heavy flavor production through semileptonic decays of charm and bottom mesons ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "while the measured decay leptons provide only limited information on the original kinematics of the heavy flavor parton , these measurements are facilitated by fast online triggers and extend the kinematic range to high .    in this paper",
    ", we report star results on non - photonic electron production at midrapidity in   collisions at  = 200 gev using data recorded during year 2005 ( run2005 ) and year 2008 ( run2008 ) with a total integrated luminosity of 2.8 pb@xmath16 and 2.6 pb@xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the present results are consistent with the next - to - leading logarithm ( fonll ) calculation within its theoretical uncertainties . utilizing the measured relative contributions of b and d mesons to non - photonic electrons which were obtained from a study of electron - hadron correlations ( e - h )  @xcite",
    ", we determine the invariant cross section of electrons from bottom and charm meson decays separately at @xmath0 3.0 gev/@xmath1 .",

    "star is a large acceptance , multi - purpose experiment composed of several individual detector subsystems with tracking inside a large solenoidal magnet generating a uniform field of 0.5 t  @xcite .",
    "the detector subsystems relevant for the present analysis are briefly described in the following .      the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite is the main charged particle tracking device in star .",
    "the tpc covers @xmath171.0 units in pseudorapidity ( @xmath18 ) for tracks crossing all layers of pads , and the full azimuth .",
    "particle momentum is determined from track curvature in the solenoidal field . in this analysis ,",
    "tpc tracks are used for momentum determination , electron - hadron separation ( using specific ionization @xmath19 ) , to reconstruct the interaction vertex , and to project to the calorimeter for further hadron rejection .",
    "the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) measures the energy deposited by photons and electrons and provides a trigger signal .",
    "it is located inside the magnet coil outside the tpc , covering @xmath20 and @xmath21 in azimuth , matching the tpc acceptance .",
    "the bemc is a lead - scintillator sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with a nominal energy resolution of @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the full calorimeter is segmented into 4800 projective towers .",
    "a tower covers 0.05 rad in @xmath23 and 0.05 units in @xmath18 .",
    "each tower consists of a stack of 20 layers of lead and 21 layers of scintillator with an active depth of 23.5 cm .",
    "the first two scintillator layers are read out separately providing the calorimeter preshower signal , which is not used in this analysis . a shower maximum detector ( bsmd )",
    "is positioned behind the fifth scintillator layer .",
    "the bsmd is a double layer wire proportional counter with strip readout .",
    "the two layers of the bsmd , each containing 18000 strips , provide precise spacial resolution in @xmath23 and @xmath18 and improve the electron - hadron separation .",
    "the bemc also provides a high - energy trigger based on the highest energy measured by a single tower in order to enrich the event samples with high-@xmath24 electromagnetic energy deposition",
    ".      the beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite are two identical counters located on each side of the interaction region covering the full azimuth and 2.1 @xmath255.0 .",
    "each detector consists of sets of small and large hexagonal scintillator tiles grouped into a ring and mounted around the beam pipe at a distance of 3.7 m from the interaction point . in both run2008 and run2005 ,",
    "the bbc served as a minimum - bias trigger to record the integrated luminosity by requiring a coincidence of signals in at least one of the small tiles ( 3.3 @xmath255.0 ) on each side of the interaction region .",
    "the cross - section sampled with the bbc trigger is @xmath26 mb  @xcite for @xmath2+@xmath2 collisions .",

    "each vpd consists of 19 lead converters plus plastic scintillators with photomultiplier - tube readout that are positioned very close to the beam pipe on each side of star .",
    "each vpd is approximately 5.7 m from the interaction point and covers the pseudorapidity interval 4.24 @xmath28 5.1 .",
    "the vpd trigger condition is similar to that of the bbc trigger except that the vpd has much better timing resolution , enabling the selected events to be constrained to a smaller range ( @xmath2930 cm in _ d_+au run ) around the interaction point .",

    "the amount of material is mostly from the beam pipe ( bp ) , the ifc , air , and a wrap around the beam pipe . in run2005 , the amount of material is estimated to be @xmath30 10 times larger in front of the tpc inner field cage  @xcite and is dominated by the silicon detectors which were removed before run2008 .",
    "the contribution from the tpc gas is not significant because we require the radial location of the first tpc point of reconstructed tracks to be less than 70 cm ( see sec .",
    "[ eid_cut_eff_est ] ) in the run2008 analysis ; furthermore , conversion electrons originating from tpc gas have low probability to be reconstructed by the tpc tracking due to the short track length . while the run2008 simulation describes the material distribution very well ,",

    "the statistical uncertainty of each data point is obtained by adding the relative statistical uncertainties of the corresponding data points in the non - photonic electron and the @xmath33 measurement in quadrature .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are treated similarly , except that the uncertainties from the interpolation process are also included .",
    "the measured bottom electrons are consistent with the central value of fonll calculation and the charm electrons are in between the central value and upper limit of the fonll calculation , the uncertainties of which are from the variation of heavy quark masses and scales . from the measured spectrum ,",

    "the 8.1% global scale uncertainty from the bbc cross section is included in the total systematic uncertainty .",
    "relying on theoretical model predictions to extrapolate the measured results to the phase space beyond the reach of the experiment , one can estimate the total cross section for charm or bottom quark production .",
    "we perform a pythia calculation with the same parameters as in ref .  @xcite . after normalizing the @xmath24 spectrum to our high-   measurements and extrapolating the results to the full kinematic phase space",
    ", we obtain a total bottom production cross section of 1.34 @xmath41b . however ,",
    "with the pythia calculation using the same parameters except msel=5 , i.e. bottom production processes instead of minimum - bias processes as in the former calculation , we obtain a value of 1.83 @xmath42b .",
    "the pythia authors recommend the minimum - bias processes  @xcite .",
    "this large variation between the extracted total bottom production cross sections comes mostly from the large difference in the shape of the bottom electron spectrum in the two pythia calculations with msel=1 and with msel=5 .",
    "since both calculations are normalized to the measured data , the difference in the shape shows up at @xmath24 @xmath43 3 gev/@xmath1 . the fact that the pythia calculation with msel=5 only includes leading order diagrams of bottom production causes the difference between the pythia calculations .",
    "measurements in the low @xmath24 region are therefore important for the understanding of bottom quark production at rhic . both values are consistent with the fonll  @xcite prediction , @xmath44b , within its uncertainty .",
    "star measurements of high @xmath24 non - photonic electron production in @xmath31 collisions at @xmath3= 200 gev using data from run2005 and run2008 agree with each other despite the large difference in background .",
    "this measurement and phenix measurement are consistent with each other within the quoted uncertainties . after correcting a mistake in the photonic electron reconstruction efficiency ,",
    "the published star result using year 2003 data is consistent with our present measurements .",
    "we are able to disentangle the electrons from bottom and charm meson decays in the non - photonic electron spectrum using the measured ratio of @xmath33 and the measured non - photonic cross section .",
    "the integrated bottom and charm electron cross sections ( @xmath4 ) at 3 gev/@xmath37 10 gev/@xmath1 are determined separately as      fonll can describe these measurements within its theoretical uncertainties .",
    "future measurements on low-@xmath24 electrons from bottom meson decay are important to overcome the large uncertainties of the derived total bottom quark production cross section that originate mostly from the large variations of theoretical model prediction in the low-@xmath24 region .",
