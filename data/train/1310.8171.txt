    "in recent years , two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have gained intense interest not only from theory communities , but also from experimental scientists .",
    "2d materials are interesting due to their unique physical properties .",
    "for example 2d mos@xmath3 is a direct band gap semiconductor , whereas 3d mos@xmath3 is an indirect band semiconductor , while nbse@xmath3 retains its metallic character both in 2d and 3d structures.@xcite in contrast 2d ge is a poor metal , whereas 3d ge is a semiconductor.@xcite reduced dimensionality can sometimes help to reduce the defect formation energy of magnetic systems.@xcite light elements ( c , si , ge , e.g.)based 2d structures have very unique properties .",
    "graphene , which is a 2d crystal with carbon atoms arrayed in the flat hexagonal lattice of graphite , has dirac - like electronic structure with linear dispersion around the fermi level ( @xmath4).@xcite therefore , graphene is considered to be a host for dirac type electrons , whose unusual properties have been studied extensively in graphene monolayers produced by mechanical exfoliation from graphite.@xcite    silicene , which is a 2d buckled monolayer honeycomb structure of si atoms , has also gotten much attention around the world.@xcite it is demonstrated by first - principles calculations that low - buckled silicene is dynamically stable and has a linear electronic dispersion relation near @xmath2 points at the corner of the brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite the stability of silicene can be understood from the nature of @xmath5 hybridization . although silicene is isoelectronic to graphene , but si has a larger ionic radius , which promotes @xmath6 type hybridization . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath7 type hybridization is energetically more favourable in c , whereas in a 2d layer of si atoms , the bonding is formed by mixed @xmath7 and @xmath6 hybridization .",
    "hence , silicene is slightly buckled and such buckling creates new possibilities for manipulating the dispersion of electrons in silicene and opening an electrically controlled sublattice - asymmetry band gap ,  @xcite which is not possible in graphene due to sublattice - symmetry .",
    "the electronic @xmath8- and @xmath9-bands derived from the si @xmath10 orbital disperse linearly to cross at @xmath4 , and the silicene electrons behave as massless dirac fermions .",
    "this unusual property of silicene puts it as a promising candidate for quantum spin hall effects.@xcite    recent experiments have demonstrated silicene on different substrates  @xcite with a hope to utilize massless fermions in silicene .",
    "however , the results are somehow conflicting .",
    "et al._@xcite have shown that buckled silicene on zrb@xmath3 has an energy gap at @xmath4 .",
    "the angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiment of @xmath11 silicene showed a linear band structure , which is considered to be the finger - print of dirac fermions , and the dirac point was measured to be 0.3 ev below @xmath4.@xcite in another experiment carried out by chen and his co - workers ,  @xcite the dirac point was @xmath12 ev below @xmath4 . in both of these experimental work",
    "the fermi velocity was close to the theoretical value of @xmath13 @xmath14.@xcite on the other hand , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations found linear dispersion only within a energy interval @xmath15 ev , which is smaller than the experimentally reported values.@xcite in spite of these two pioneer experimental work , a very recent experimental study  @xcite on landau level in silicene on ag and absence of the characteristic signals was attributed to the landau level , which does not agree with the previous experimental work of vogt _ et al._@xcite and chen _",
    "et al._@xcite    from the above comprehensive literature , it can be inferred that it is very essential to investigate the nature of dirac point in silicene in different external perturbations , e.g. , strain , pressure , electric field , etc .",
    "silicene can be deposited on different substrates for practical applications and its electronic properties can be perturbed by strain or interfacial effect .",
    "so , from applications point of view , we must investigate the desired properties against strain / distortion , which can be induced by substrate .",
    "this effect can not be ignored in real devices because there is always lattice mismatch whenever we grow a material on a substrate . in some cases ,",
    "such distortion / strain is technologically beneficial and can be used to engineer the band structure of a material .",
    "@xcite therefore , in this article , we inquire the electronic structure and cohesion of silicene under distortions and electric fields .",
    "the present calculations are performed in the framework of dft  @xcite using linear combinations of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) as implemented in the siesta code .  @xcite we used a double-@xmath16 polarized ( dzp ) basis set for all atoms .",
    "we employed the local density approximation ( lda ) as parametrized by ceperly and adler , @xcite for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we used standard norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite in their fully nonlocal form .@xcite we found that 200 ry was enough to converge the lattice parameters and band structure of bulk si and monolayer of silicene .",
    "the brillouin zone integration was performed using monkhorst - pack grids of @xmath17 .    the optimized lattice constant and buckling parameter @xmath18 of silicene are @xmath19and @xmath20 , respectively , which are comparable with the previous work.@xcite as mentioned in the introduction that when silicene is deposited on a substrate then it is expected that silicene may distort slightly , therefore , we considered different distortions .",
    "we mainly distort the bond angle between the si atoms , that will also change the bond length of si - si .",
    "in such distortions , the lattice parameters of silicene were kept at their optimized values .",
    "the distorted systems are denoted by @xmath210 - 5 ) . here",
    "@xmath22 corresponds to pristine silicene .",

    "it is essential to discuss the cohesive energy of silicene under different strain and electric field .",
    "first , we calculated the cohesive energy of bulk si .",

    "our calculated @xmath25 does not include a correction for the zero point energy which is about 0.103 ev  @xcite .",
    "once we confirmed that our bulk @xmath28 agrees with previous work , we then calculated @xmath25 of silicene which is @xmath29 ev .",
    "this value is also comparable with calculation using other functional and computational codes.@xcite this shows that bulk si is 0.34 ev per atom more stable than silicene .",

    "it is clear that @xmath25 increases with @xmath30 .",
    "one can also judge that external distortion decreases @xmath25 of silicene .",
    "the pristine silicene has large @xmath25 at higher fields , which suggests that silicene may become unstable .",
    "however , if we distort silicene in such a way that changes the bond angle between sublattice a and b , then @xmath25 becomes smaller even smaller than bulk si at higher strain .",
    "though , distortions decrease @xmath25 of silicene , but it may not be dynamically stable due to imaginary frequencies in the phonons mode along the @xmath31 direction of bz.@xcite the increment ( decrement ) of @xmath25 in electric field ( distortion ) can be partially understood in terms of dipole - dipole interactions . figure  [ energy - filed ] ( b ) shows the dipole moments under electric field of different systems @xmath23 .",
    "we see that electric field induces dipole moment in silicene which grows with the strength of electric field .",
    "therefore , @xmath25 increases with electric field .",
    "the marked difference between @xmath25 and dipole moment is the behaviour of silicene in the external field the dipole moment increases linearly with electric field , consistent with the previous work ,  @xcite but the cohesive energy does not follow a linear trend at higher fields .",
    "it is also noticeable that the distorted systems have larger induced dipole moment , and on the other hand , the distorted systems have lower @xmath25 .",
    "so , the electronic polarization of valence electrons also contributes to the cohesive energy of silicene .    to have some physical arguments for the behaviour of @xmath25 under electric field , and to know why @xmath25 changes with @xmath30 and distortion , we calculated the electronic band structures of silicene under different distortions @xmath23 and electric fields .",

    "it is interesting to note that strain does not induce any band gap opening .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the well studied system , graphene.@xcite when the structure of silicene is distorted , the linear dispersion relation at @xmath2 near the fermi energy is preserved , and the dirac point @xmath34 is shifted below the fermi energy at higher distortions . note that silicene retains the semi - metallic band structure , until the bond length ( angle ) @xmath35 (107.85@xmath36 ) , which is close to the bulk si values .",
    "major changes in the electronic structure around the @xmath37 point are also visible .",
    "the @xmath37 degenerate band around @xmath38 ev also retains its degenerate behaviour under the studied distortions .",
    "however , when the silicene is distorted this degenerate band moves towards the fermi energy and finally touches the fermi energy before transferring to metallic silicene .",
    "similarly the high energy bands around @xmath39 ev also move towards the fermi energy at higher strains .",

    "all bands cross the fermi energy and silicene is no longer semi - metallic .",
    "it suggests that silicene can absorb such small deformations before changing its electronic structure .",
    "such behaviour of silicene advices that silicene can be used in nano devices provided that one should not cross this distortable limit . from these calculations",
    ", we can infer that the bond angle(length ) between the si atoms in silicene plays a vital role to control the dirac cones .",
    "we believe that the experimentally determined scattered results  @xcite may not only be due to the interface effect,@xcite but also due to different distortions , which change the bond angle of silicene , when deposited on a substrate .",
    "even distortion changes the electronic structure , and at higher strain ( bond angles smaller than @xmath40 ) the dirac point moves below the fermi energy and retains its linear dispersion .",
    "the location of the dirac point is very important and it can be used to engineer the carrier ( holes or electrons ) concentration @xmath41 . for a 2d dirac system , @xmath41 can be estimated from the distance between @xmath34 and @xmath4 , using the expression @xmath42 ,  @xcite where @xmath43 can be calculated from the linear dispersion around @xmath2 as @xmath44 .",
    "interpretation of fig .",
    "[ band - strain ] in terms of @xmath41 shows that silicene behaves as a @xmath1-type doped system beyond system @xmath45 , @xmath34 is shifted below the fermi energy and @xmath41 is negative for the distorted silicene .",
    "this suggests that such distortion can behave as a self doping in silicene .",
    "the physical mechanism of this behaviour can be understood from the band structure ( see fig .",
    "[ band - strain ] ) , where the highest occupied states at @xmath37 point move towards the fermi energy under different strains . at bond angle @xmath0 ( @xmath46)(compressed about 11% ) ,",
    "the occupied states ( strain free case ) become unoccupied and cross the fermi energy and silicene behaves as a @xmath47type doped system .",
    "we see from these band structures that the band structure of silicene under small strain follows the linear dispersion relation at @xmath2 point .",
    "such strains can only lower the dirac point , , changing the carriers type .",
    "strain is a good tool to engineer the band structure of silicene .",
    "chemical doping , e.g. , li , c , h , co , dramatically changes the band structure and silicene does not have a linear dispersion relation around @xmath2 point in the bz .",
    "such chemical doping may either transform silicene to metallic or insulating one .",
    "it seems that the electronic structure can be tuned either by strain or electric field .",
    "indeed , large strain or e - field can destroy the linear relation of dispersion .",
    "now we investigate the electronic structure of silicene in the presence of external electric field @xmath30 .",
    "the calculated band structure of silicene around dirac point for various electric field and distortions @xmath23 are shown in fig.[band - efield ] .",
    "the band gap in silicene is opened due to breaking of inversion symmetry by the electric field since the potential seen by the atoms at the sites @xmath48 and @xmath49 are different . in this situation ,",
    "the finite value of on - site energy difference @xmath50 arises due to the potential difference and hence , we can write @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) are proportionality constant and the potential seen by the atom at the site @xmath54 , respectively . for constant electric field between the sheets , the potential difference @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the electric field intensity and @xmath18 is the buckling parameter of silicene , which is non - zero ( zero ) for silicene ( graphene )",

    "[ energy - filed ] ( b ) .",
    "it will be very essential to estimate this proportionality constant @xmath57 ( @xmath59 ) , which can be estimated from the slope of @xmath58 vs @xmath30 .",
    "for this purpose , we varied @xmath30 from 0.0 to 1.0 @xmath60 and calculated @xmath58 at @xmath2 point for each value of @xmath30 .",

    "@xcite figure [ band - efield](f ) shows @xmath57 of all systems .",
    "it shows that @xmath57 also increases linearly with distortion irrespective of the location of dirac point .",

    "hence , the band gap and the effective masses are proven to be proportional to @xmath30 .    before summarizing our work",
    ", we must note that the band gaps and the band widths are usually underestimated by dft - lda , which can be corrected by gw type calculations.@xcite previous gw calculations show @xmath62 50 to 140% enhancement of band gap as compared with dft - lda calculations.@xcite therefore , it is speculated that our calculated e - field induced band gaps and band widths may be larger than those shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , both gw and lda predict linear dispersion relation around @xmath2-point and semi - metallic behaviour in low buckled silicene.@xcite    in summary , we used dft to elucidate the origins of experimentally determined different dirac points in silicene .",
    "we showed that the cohesive energy of silicene decreases with distortions and increases with external electric fields .",
    "the band structure calculated at different distortions and electric fields showed that as silicene was distorted , the cohesive energy decreased due to unoccupied states at @xmath37 , and at larger distortions , the dirac cones also shifted below @xmath32 and silicene behaved as an @xmath1-doped silicene .",
    "this @xmath1 type behaviour of silicene also participated in lowering of the cohesive energy of silicene . from our dft - lda calculations",
    ", we came to the conclusion that silicene can retain the semi - metallic band structure when the bond angle between the si atoms in silicene is closer to the bond angle between the si atoms in bulk si .",
    "therefore , the scattered experimental reports about the position of dirac point may be attributed to different distortions of silicene on different substrates .",
    "we believe that it is not only the interfacial effect , but also the bond angle between the si atoms in silicene that destroys the dirac cones in silicene .",
    "these two factors can determine the existence or nonexistence of semi - metallic nature of silicene , when deposited on a substrate .",
