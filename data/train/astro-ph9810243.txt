    "the two best - studied samples of bllacs are the einstein extended medium sensitivity x - ray and the 1jy radio samples ( stocke et al .  1991 ; stickel et al .",
    "1991 ) . however , numerous others exist including the einstein slew , heao , exosat , s4 and pg samples ( perlman et al .  1996 ; wood et al .  1984 ; giommi et al .  1991 , khr & schmidt 1990 , fleming et al .  1993 ) in addition to new samples based on the rosat all - sky survey ( see , e.g. , beckmann et al . , these proceedings ) . with so many existing samples ,",
    "why are more required ?",
    "first , despite these attempts only @xmath0250 bllacs were known prior to the rosat mission , and the largest complete samples consisted of only @xmath030 objects .",
    "second , these objects were chosen with a variety of selection methods some of which have biased previous samples against particular bllac subclasses .",
    "new samples which incorporate the observational consequnces of the underlying physics which drives the bllac phenomenon are required if we are to understand in detail the relationships between bllacs and other agn or between the different bllac subclasses .",
    "third , previous surveys have only sampled the brightest objects in either the x - ray or radio bands which has led to gaps of two orders of magnitude between , e.g. , the radio fluxes of sources in radio- and x - ray - selected samples .",
    "interesting populations of objects lurk between the extremes of radio- and x - ray - dominated objects and discovery of them requires delving into fainter populations .",
    "finally , only now are suitable parent surveys available which will allow us to satisfy these goals .",
    "x - ray surveys contain relatively large fractions of bllacs .",
    "coupled with the fact that radio - silent bllacs either do not exist or are exceedingly rare ( stocke et al .",
    "1990 ) , correlation of x - ray and radio surveys is an efficient means of creating new bllac samples .",
    "therefore , we have chosen the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) , the 6 cm green bank radio ( gregory et al.1996 ) and first 20 cm surveys ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) for our parent surveys .",
    "the rgb sample consists of 1567 sources found in a correlation of the rass and green bank catalogs .",
    "optical spectroscopy of previously unidentified objects revealed 38 new bllacs ( laurent - muehleisen et al .",
    "1998 ) and resulted in a final sample of 125 rgb bllacs .",
    "these objects span a large range in radio ( 3@xmath1s@xmath2@xmath12160mjy ) , optical ( 13.3@xmath1b@xmath121.2 ) and x - ray ( 3@xmath3@xmath1f@xmath4@xmath1@xmath5erg s@xmath6@xmath7 ) fluxes .",
    "optical polarimetry shows that @xmath060% of the sources are polarized @xmath83% ( pursimo et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the rgb complete sample consists of 32 bllacs with b@xmath918.0mag in a 3970deg@xmath10 region of sky .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the broadband spectral energy distribution of the rgb bllacs .",
    "these figures clearly indicate that intermediate bllacs , those between the previously disparate classes of low and high energy peaked bllacs ( lbls and hbls , respectively ) are present in large numbers and that no clear division exists between the two subclasses ( see also siebert et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the biggest advantage the rass - first correlation has compared to the rgb survey is its twenty times deeper radio flux limit which enables the study of lower radio luminosity sources and also moderate luminosity sources to higher redshifts .",
    "this facilitates a better study of the effects of cosmic evolution vs.  beaming on bllac logn - logs distributions and luminosity functions .",
    "the rass - first sample currently consists of 82 bllacs in a 3000deg@xmath10 region of the sky .",
    "spectroscopic identifications are continuing but the bllacs found to date range from 1mjy to 1500mjy and from very low redshift ( 0.034 ) to z@xmath111.37 .",
    "the first bright quasar survey ( fbqs ; gregg et al .",
    "1996 ; white et al .  1998 ) is a program designed to identify a new deep radio - selected sample of quasars .",
    "spectroscopy of bright ( r@xmath117.8 ) , blue ( b@xmath12r@xmath12.0 ) optically unresolved sources has shown that this survey is also a surprisingly rich source of bllacs , yielding a sample of 158 objects .",
    "the optical color and morphology criteria have undoubtedly biased the sample , but it has the advantage , unlike the rgb or rass - first samples , of selecting bllacs independent of their x - ray emission .",
    "it is therefore most similar to the radio - selected 1jy sample , but with a flux limit 1000 times more sensitive . this sample will undoubtedly be useful for studying the transition between lbls and hbls at radio flux densities between 1 and 1000mjy , a regime which presently is dominated by x - ray - selected samples .",
    "bllacs , like all blazars , exhibit flat radio spectral indices , a fact used to create the 1jy bllac sample .",
    "the high radio flux limit of the 1jy sample can easily be improved upon using the first and green bank catalogs .",
    "we have constructed a sample of @xmath05000 sources with radio spectral indices flatter than 0.5 between 6 and 20 cm and brighter than 35mjy .",
    "we have obtained spectroscopic identifications for @xmath01/3 of the 1600 sources with counterparts on the poss i plates and constructed a sample of 68 bllacs . like the fbqs bllac sample , the first flat spectrum sample is selected completely independent of x - ray emission .",
    "this sample will be ideal for studying the transition between flat spectrum radio quasars and bllacs .",
    "new bllac samples based on the green bank and first radio surveys and the rass x - ray survey are proving highly successful . in figure 3",
    "we show the radio logn - logs distribution for all known bllacs in the first survey ( see  3 - 5 ) .",
    "clearly these samples bridge the gap between hbls and lbls and will provide useful databases for constraining unification models and the relationship between bllacs and other classes of agn .",
