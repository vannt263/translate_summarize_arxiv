    "many genomic datasets consist of measurements from multiple samples at a common set of genetic markers , with no  phenotype \" representing clinical state or experimental condition of the sample .",
    "datasets of this type include genome - wide measurements of dna copy number or dna methylation , for which the main goal is to identify aberrant regions on the genome that tend to have extreme measurements in comparison to other regions .",
    "testing for aberrations requires some thought about appropriate test statistics , and constructing a null distribution that appropriately reflects serial correlation structures inherent to genomic data . a meta - analysis across several genome - wide association studies",
    "might also be viewed in this framework , in the sense that the testing for association within each study produces a vector of @xmath0-values that might be viewed as a vector of  observations . \"    the problem of interest to us is the identification of aberrant markers , where multiple samples exhibit a coordinated ( unidirectional ) , departure from the expected state .",
    "aberrant markers are of particular interest in cancer studies , where tumor suppressors or oncogenes exhibit dna copy variation or modified methylation levels .",
    "similarly , it may be possible to identify pleiotropic single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) in disease association by identifying genetic markers that repeatedly give rise to small @xmath0-values in multiple association studies .",
    "in this paper we provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of a permutation based testing procedure for identifying aberrant markers in genomic data sets .",
    "the procedure , called dinamic , was introduced in walter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and is described in detail below .",
    "in contrast to other procedures which permute all observations , dinamic is based on cyclic shifting of samples .",
    "cyclic shifting eliminates concurrent findings across samples , but retains the adjacency of observations in a sample ( with the exception of the first and last entries ) , thereby largely preserving the correlation structure among markers .",
    "our principal result is that , for a broad family of null data distributions , the sampling distribution of the dinamic procedure is close to the true conditional distribution of the data restricted to its cyclic shifts . as a corollary",
    ", we find that the cyclic shift testing provides asymptotically correct type i error rates .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to a description of the cyclic shift procedure , a discussion of the underlying testing framework within which our analysis is carried out , and a statement of our principal result . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we apply cyclic shift testing to dna copy number analysis , dna methylation analysis , and meta - analysis of gwas data , and show that the results are consistent with the existing biological literature . because of its broad applicability and solid statistical foundation , we believe that cyclic shift testing is a valuable tool for the identification of aberrant markers in many large scale genomic studies .",
    "we consider a data set derived from @xmath1 subjects at @xmath2 common genomic locations or markers .",
    "the data is arranged in an @xmath3 matrix @xmath4 with values in a set @xmath5 .",
    "depending on the application , @xmath6 may be finite or infinite .",
    "the entry @xmath7 of @xmath4 contains data from subject @xmath8 at marker @xmath9 .",
    "thus the @xmath8th row @xmath10 of @xmath4 contains the data from subject @xmath8 at all markers , and the @xmath9th column @xmath11 of @xmath4 contains the data at marker @xmath9 across subjects . for @xmath12 let @xmath13 be a local summary statistic for the @xmath9th marker . in most applications",
    "the simple sum statistic @xmath14 is employed . in order to identify locations with coordinated departures from baseline behavior ,",
    "we apply a global summary statistic to the local statistics @xmath15 .",
    "when looking for extreme , positive departures from baseline it is natural to employ the global statistic @xmath16 to detect negative departures from baseline , the maximum may be replaced by a minimum .",
    "the cyclic shift procedure and the supporting theory in theorem [ thm1 ] apply to arbitrary local statistics , as well as a range of global statistics .",
    "given a data matrix @xmath4 , we are interested in assessing the significance of the observed value @xmath17 of the global statistic . when @xmath18 is found to be significant , the identity and location of the marker @xmath9 having the maximum ( or minimum ) local statistic is of primary biological importance . while in special cases it is possible to compute @xmath0-values for @xmath18 under parametric assumptions , permutation based approaches are often an attractive and more flexible alternative .",
    "a permutation based @xmath0-value can be obtained by applying permutations @xmath19 to the entries of @xmath4 , producing the matrices @xmath20 , and then comparing @xmath18 to the resulting values @xmath21 of the global statistic .",
    "the maximum global statistic accounts for multiple comparisons across markers , so it is not necessary to apply further multiplicity correction to the permuted values @xmath21 .",
    "the performance and suitability of permutation based @xmath0-values in the marker identification problem depends critically on the family of allowable permutations @xmath19 . if @xmath19 permutes the entries of @xmath4 without preserving row or column membership , then the induced null distribution is equivalent to sampling the entries of @xmath4 at random without replacement . in this case",
    "the induced null distribution does not capture the correlation of measurements within a sample , or systematic differences ( e.g.  in scale , location , correlation ) between samples .",
    "in real data , correlations within and systematic differences between samples can be present even in the absence of aberrant markers . as such",
    ", @xmath0-values obtained under full permutation of @xmath4 will be sensitive to secondary features of the data and may yields significant @xmath0-values even when no aberrant markers are present .",
    "an obvious improvement of full permutation is to separately permute the values in each row ( sample ) of the data matrix .",
    "this approach is used in the gistic procedure of beroukhim et al .",
    "while row - by - row permutation preserves some differences between rows , it eliminates correlations within rows ( and correlation differences between rows ) , so that the induced null distribution is again sensitive to secondary , correlation based features of the data that are not related to the presence of aberrant markers .    the dinamic cyclic shift testing procedure of walter et al .",
    "( 2011 ) addresses the shortcomings of full and row - by - row permutation by further restricting the set of allowable permutations . in the procedure , each row of the data matrix is shifted to the left in a cyclic fashion , as detailed below , so that the first @xmath22 entries of the vector are placed after the last element ; the values of the offsets @xmath22 are chosen independently from row to row .",
    "cyclic shifting preserves the serial correlation structure with each sample , except at the single break point where the last and first elements of the unshifted sample are placed next to one another . at the same time , the use of different offsets breaks concurrency among the samples , so that the resulting cyclic null distribution is appropriate for testing the significance of @xmath17 .      formally , a _",
