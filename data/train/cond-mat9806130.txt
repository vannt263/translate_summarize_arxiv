    "consider the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice with @xmath4 vertices .",
    "the partition function is defined by @xmath5 where the sum is over all configurations of non - intersecting loops . in any given configuration @xmath6",
    "is the number of occupied vertices , with @xmath7 the weight of the empty ( unoccupied ) vertices .",
    "the variable @xmath0 is the fugacity of a closed loop , with @xmath8 their number in any given configuration .",
    "a typical loop configuration is shown in fig .",
    "1 .    = 2.5 in    this model originates from the high - temperature expansion @xcite of the o(@xmath0 ) or @xmath0-vector model @xcite .",
    "nienhuis identified two branches of critical points for the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice defined by @xcite @xmath9 baxter has shown that this is also the necessary condition for which the row transfer matrix of the corresponding 3-state vertex model can be diagonalised by means of the co - ordinate bethe ansatz @xcite .",
    "this vertex model turned out to be a special case of a more general solvable model defined on the square lattice @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz solution was later extended to open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "most importantly , the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice has led to a wealth of exact information on the configurational properties of self - avoiding walks in the @xmath10 @xcite limit . for a review ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the simplest result concerns the enumeration of a single @xmath11-step self - avoiding walk from a point deep in the bulk , for which the number of configurations scales as @xmath12 for large @xmath11 .",
    "the connective constant , @xmath13 , follows from ( [ poly ] ) .",
    "the configurational exponent @xmath14 was first obtained via coulomb gas calculations @xcite .",
    "more general configurational exponents have been obtained for arbitrary networks of long chains , both in the bulk and near a surface @xcite .",
    "given the solvability of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice along the line of critical points defined by ( [ poly ] ) , i had often wondered if the corresponding model could be solved on the 3 - 12 lattice depicted in fig .",
    "2 . it also has co - ordination number three .",
    "prompted by a suggestion that the connective constant for self - avoiding walks on the 3 - 12 lattice may also be obtained exactly , jensen and guttmann have found the value @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "they were able to relate the generating functions for both self - avoiding walks and self - avoiding polygons on the honeycomb lattice to those on the 3 - 12 lattice by a simple change of variables .",
    "this mapping is discussed here in the context of the more general o(@xmath0 ) loop model , which indeed turns out to be solvable at criticality .",
    "vertices on the honeycomb lattice are either empty or occupied . for each type of vertex configuration on the honeycomb lattice",
    "there are two possible configurations on the 3 - 12 lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "it thus follows that any given configuration of loops on the honeycomb lattice , with weight @xmath15 , maps to @xmath16 possible configurations on the 3 - 12 lattice , with @xmath17 .",
    "one of the @xmath18 possible configurations generated from the honeycomb configuration in fig . 1",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    = 3.5 in    the partition function of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the 3 - 12 lattice can be written @xmath19 this is to be compared with @xmath20    it follows that the critical points of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the 3 - 12 lattice are given by solving ( [ poly ] ) with @xmath21      in particular , when @xmath1 @xmath22 the exact connective constant @xmath23 follows from the largest real root , as obtained by jensen and guttmann @xcite .",
    "equivalently , it follows on solving @xmath24 their mapping @xmath25 between generating functions follows on defining @xmath26 as the weight per step .",
    "another point of note is the ising model at @xmath3 .",
    "it is known that the critical temperature of the ising model on both the honeycomb and triangular lattices follows from ( [ poly ] ) and the standard duality relation . in a similar way , the critical ising point can be obtained from ( [ map ] ) for both the 3 - 12 lattice and its dual ( the asanoha lattice ) . for @xmath3 ( [ poly ] ) and ( [ map ] ) give @xmath27 taking the positive root gives @xmath28 as the critical coupling on the dual asanoha lattice .",
    "the critical point @xmath29 on the 3 - 12 lattice follows from the duality relation @xmath30 .",
    "the ising values ( [ asa ] ) and ( [ 3.12 ] ) are precisely those given by syozi @xcite , who arrived at the ising model on the 3 - 12 lattice from the ising model on the honeycomb lattice after the successive application of the double decoration process and the star - triangle transformation .",
    "the partition function of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the honeycomb lattice has been mapped to that of the o(@xmath0 ) loop model on the 3 - 12 lattice .",
    "the critical behaviour of both models is thus related . in particular , they share the same operator content and thus critical exponents . although the mapping between the models is particularly simple , it nevertheless provides a clear example of universality between models defined on regular and semi - regular lattices .",
    "the non - universal features , such as the critical points , are related via the transformation ( [ map ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 this gives the exact value @xmath2 found recently by jensen and guttmann @xcite for the connective constant of self - avoiding walks on the 3 - 12 lattice .",
    "when @xmath3 the exact critical points , ( [ 3.12 ] ) and ( [ asa ] ) , are recovered for the ising model on the 3 - 12 lattice and the dual asanoha lattice .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank tony guttmann and ivan jensen for their interest in the self - avoiding walk problem and for communicating their results prior to publication .",
    "i gratefully acknowledge financial support from the australian research council ."
