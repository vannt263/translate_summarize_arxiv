    "a non - negative matrix of order  @xmath1 with unit row and column sums is called doubly stochastic . to each strictly positive square matrix @xmath2",
    "there corresponds a unique re - scaled matrix @xmath3 such that @xmath4 where @xmath3 is strictly positive with unit row and column sums .",
    "the doubly stochastic projection @xmath5 can be computed by iterative proportional scaling ( deming and stephan , 1940 ) , although , in this context , it is usually called the sinkhorn algorihm ( sinkhorn , 1964 ; linial , samordnitsky and wigderson , 1998 ) .",
    "a non - negative matrix @xmath2 containing some zero components is said to be scalable if there exist real numbers @xmath6 such that @xmath7 where @xmath3 is doubly stochastic . in that case , the pattern of zeros in @xmath2 is the same as the pattern of zeros in  @xmath3 .",
    "a non - negative matrix is scalable if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "the permanent of a square matrix @xmath3 @xmath9 is the sum over permutations @xmath10\\to[n]$ ] of products , @xmath11 , one component taken from each row and each column .",
    "if @xmath12 , then the permanents are related by @xmath13 thus , the problem of approximating the permanent of a scalable non - negative matrix is reduced to the approximation of the corresponding doubly stochastic matrix , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "it is known that the permanent of a generic matrix is not computable in polynomial time as a function of  @xmath1 ( valiant , 1979 ) .",
    "since exact computation is not feasible for large matrices , most authors have sought to approximate the permanent using monte - carlo methods .",
    "for example , jerrum and sinclair ( 1989 ) and jerrum , sinclair and vigoda ( 2004 ) use a markov chain technique , while kou and mccullagh ( 2009 ) use an importance - sampling scheme for @xmath14-permanent approximation .",
    "this paper develops an entirely different sort of computable approximation , deterministic but asymptotic .",
    "the determinantal formula ( [ det_approx ] ) is an asymptotic approximation for the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix  @xmath15 , the conditions for which are ordinarily satisfied if the original matrix  @xmath3 has independent and identically distributed components .",
    "the approximation is not universally valid for all matrix sequences , but it is valid under moderate - deviation conditions , which can be checked .",
    "for example , @xmath3  may be symmetric .",
    "the scaling algorithm has an interpretation connected with maximum likelihood for generalized linear models as follows .",
    "let the components of @xmath2 be independent exponential variables with means @xmath16 such that @xmath17 lies in the additive subspace _",
    "row+col_. the maximum - likelihood projection @xmath18 is such that @xmath19 ( mccullagh and nelder , 1989 ) .",
    "the residual matrix @xmath20 is strictly positive with row and column sums equal to  @xmath1 , from which it follows that @xmath21 is doubly stochastic .",
    "the residual deviance @xmath22 is a measure of total variability for strictly positive doubly stochastic matrices , taking the value zero only for the uniform matrix @xmath23 .",
    "the exponential assumption can be replaced by any gamma distribution provided that the gamma index @xmath24 is held constant .",
    "the re - scaled matrix @xmath3 thus generated is said to have the doubly stochastic dirichlet distribution @xmath25 with parameter  @xmath24 .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath24 , the more extreme the components of  @xmath3 , and the greater the deviance .",
    "the distribution @xmath26 is not uniform with respect to lebesgue measure in the sense of chatterjee , diaconis and sly ( 2010 ) , but it is presumably close for large  @xmath1 . the maximum - likelihood estimate @xmath27 is such that @xmath28 where @xmath29  is the derivative of the log gamma function .",
    "it is apparent from simulations that if @xmath30 , @xmath31 with variability decreasing in  @xmath1 .",
    "this limiting product appears to be invariably less than one for non - dirichlet matrices .",
    "the scaling @xmath5 can be accomplished either by iterative weighted least squares , as is usually done for generalized linear models , or by the sinkhorn iterative proportional scaling algorithm . for present purposes ,",
    "the latter algorithm is preferred because it is efficient and simple to implement .",
    "linial , samorodnitsky and wigderson ( 1998 ) provide a a modification that guarantees convergence in polynomial time . for moderate - deviation matrices , the time taken to compute the sinkhorn projection is usually negligible .    for a doubly stochastic matrix",
    ", it is known that @xmath32 the lower bound being attained at the matrix @xmath33 whose components are all equal ,  @xmath34 .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath35 is attained at each of the permutation matrices , which are the extreme points in the set @xmath36 of doubly - stochastic matrices of order  @xmath1 .",
    "these bounds suggest that it may be easier to develop an approximation for the permanent of a doubly stochastic matrix than the permanent of an arbitrary positive matrix .",
    "a sequence of square matrices @xmath37 in which @xmath38 is of order  @xmath1 is called _ weakly bounded _ if the absolute @xmath39th moment @xmath40 is finite for all  @xmath41 .",
    "the set @xmath36 of doubly stochastic matrices of order  @xmath1 is convex .",
    "the extreme points are the @xmath42 permutation matrices , and the central point @xmath43 is the equally - weighted average of the extremes . given two matrices @xmath44 , the row and column totals of the deviation matrix @xmath45 are zero .",
    "it is helpful to define the @xmath46-norm and associated metric in @xmath36 by the standard euclidean norm in the tangent space @xmath47 thus , the central point has norm zero , and each extreme point has norm @xmath48 .",
    "each doubly stochastic matrix has one unit eigenvalue , and all others are less than or equal to one in absolute value .",
    "consequently , it is helpful to define the operator norm in @xmath36 as the hilbert - schmidt norm of the deviation @xmath49 , i.e.  the largest absolute eigenvalue @xmath50 .",
    "the spectral gap of @xmath3 is the difference @xmath51 .",
    "a sequence of doubly stochastic matrices @xmath52 is said to be of _ moderate deviation _ if the re - scaled sequence @xmath53 is weakly bounded , and the spectral gap @xmath54 is bounded below by a positive constant .",
    "if @xmath55 are moderate - deviation sequences , the sequence @xmath56 of matrix products is also a moderate - deviation sequence , which implies that @xmath57 is also of moderate deviation .",
    "convex combinations are also of moderate deviation . finally , for fixed  @xmath24 , the random sequence @xmath58 is of moderate deviation with probability one .",
    "the main purpose of this note is to show that , for a moderate - deviation sequence @xmath59 with error decreasing as @xmath60 .",
    "one consequence is that @xmath61 is bounded as @xmath60 .",
    "even though it does not affect the order of magnitude of the error , the modified approximation @xmath62 with @xmath63 is a worthwhile improvement for numerical work .",
    "table  1 illustrates the permanental approximation applied to a class of symmetric positive definite matrices @xmath64 for points @xmath65 equally spaced on the interval @xmath66 $ ] , so the components range from @xmath67 to one .",
    "the first step uses the sinkhorn algorithm to obtain a doubly stochastic matrix @xmath3 from  @xmath68 , and the second step uses the determinantal approximation ( [ det_approx ] ) . all values shown are on the log scale . because of the difficulty of computing the exact permanent , the range of @xmath1-values shown is rather limited",
    "nevertheless , it appears that the error decreases roughly as @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for @xmath72 , in agreement with  ( [ det_approx ] ) .",
    "a sequence of matrices of this type with bounded  @xmath73 is of moderate deviation ; a sequence of matrices with @xmath74 is not .",
    "it is unclear whether a sequence with @xmath75 is moderate or not , but the approximation error does appear to decrease roughly at the rate @xmath76 or @xmath77",
    ".    for a very special class of kronecker - product matrices , table  2 shows the relative error in the approximation for substantially larger values of  @xmath1 .",
    "these matrices have two blocks of size @xmath78 each , with @xmath79 within blocks and @xmath80 between blocks . the smaller the between - blocks value , the smaller the spectral gap , and the greater the approximation error . for the associated doubly stochastic matrix  @xmath81 ,",
    "table  2 shows the exact value @xmath82 together with the error in the determinantal approximation @xmath83 .",
    "once again , the empirical evidence suggests that the error for moderate - deviation matrices with constant  @xmath73 is @xmath0 , and for large - deviation matrices , @xmath84 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a matrix of order  @xmath1 such that @xmath85 , where the row and column totals of @xmath86 are zero .",
    "if the components of @xmath86 are real numbers greater than @xmath87 , @xmath3  is doubly stochastic and @xmath88 is the deviation matrix . in the calculations that follow , @xmath86 is complex - valued and weakly bounded , and @xmath89  has spectral norm strictly less than one . in other words ,",
    "@xmath3  need not be doubly stochastic , or even real , but the associated sequence is assumed to be of moderate deviation .    the permanent expansion of @xmath90 as a polynomial of degree  @xmath1 has the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the descending factorial , and @xmath93 is the average of @xmath94 products @xmath95 taken from distinct rows and distinct columns .",
    "more explicitly , the term of degree  @xmath96 is @xmath97 with summation over distinct @xmath96-tuples @xmath98 and @xmath99 .    in the variational calculations that follow , each term such as the restricted sum @xmath100 or the unrestricted sum @xmath101",
    "is assigned a nominal order of magnitude as a function of  @xmath1 . for accounting purposes ,",
    "the components of @xmath86 are of order @xmath102 , and each product @xmath103 is also regarded as being of order one , i.e.  bounded , at least in a probabilistic sense , as @xmath60 .",
    "a sum such as @xmath100 , for fixed  @xmath96 , is of order @xmath104 , so the @xmath46-norm @xmath105 is of order @xmath106 .",
    "these sums could be of smaller order under suitable circumstances .",
    "for example , the difference @xmath107 is a sum of @xmath108 terms , and is therefore of order @xmath109 .",
    "thus , if the sum of the components of @xmath86 is zero , @xmath110 implies that the restricted sum @xmath111 is of order @xmath109 .",
    "likewise , if the components of @xmath86 were independent random variables of zero mean , @xmath112 , and a similar conclusion holds for the restricted sum .",
    "the variational calculations that follow are not based on assumptions of statistical independence of components , but on the arithmetic implications of zero - sum constraints on rows and columns .",
    "for example , @xmath3  may be symmetric .",
    "the first goal is to show that the zero - sum restriction on the rows and columns of @xmath86 implies that @xmath100 is of order @xmath113 rather than @xmath114 . in other words",
    ", @xmath93 is of order @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , the even - degree terms in the permanent expansion are @xmath102 , while the odd terms are @xmath0 .",
    "these conclusions do not hold for all doubly stochastic matrices .",
    "for example , if @xmath116 for some fixed  @xmath117 , the @xmath46-norm @xmath118 and other scalars of a similar type are not bounded .      in the term of degree three ,",
    "the restricted sum is @xmath119 in the first line , the restricted sum over @xmath120 is @xmath121 , while the restricted sum over @xmath122 of @xmath123 is @xmath124 . proceeding in this way by restricted summation over each non - repeated index",
    ", we arrive at the following expressions for the restricted tensorial sums of degree two , three and four : @xmath125 without the zero - sum constraint on the rows and columns , @xmath111 is a sum over @xmath94 @xmath86-products , and thus of order @xmath114 . in the reduced form ,",
    "each distinct value occurs in duplicate at least , so there are at most @xmath126 distinct values for the row indices and @xmath126 for the column indices .",
    "we observe that @xmath127 is @xmath106 , while @xmath128 is @xmath106 rather than @xmath129 .",
    "the five terms in @xmath130 are @xmath106 , @xmath129 , @xmath129 , @xmath131 and @xmath131 respectively .",
    "the final pair can be expressed in matrix notation as @xmath132 .    for any vector @xmath133 in @xmath134 ,",
    "let @xmath135 be the associated partition of @xmath136=\\{1,\\ldots , k\\}$ ] , i.e.  @xmath137 if @xmath138 and zero otherwise .",
    "the restricted sum @xmath139 can be expressed in reduced form either as a restricted sum or an unrestricted sum , the only difference arising in the coefficients as shown above for @xmath140 . generally speaking ,",
    "unrestricted sums are more convenient for computation . for general  @xmath96 ,",
    "the restricted sums are as follows : @xmath141 where the outer sum extends over ordered pairs @xmath142 of partitions of the set @xmath136 $ ] , and the inner sum over the row and column indices , @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which are held constant in each block .",

    "we write @xmath155 for the sum , @xmath156 in which @xmath157 and @xmath158 are constant within blocks , but the values for distinct blocks may be equal . putting these expressions together with a scalar @xmath159",
    ", we find @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the set of partitions of  @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "the polynomial ( [ per_expansion ] ) is the exponential generator @xmath162 for the moment numbers @xmath163 taking @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "the coefficients in the log series are the cumulant numbers @xmath166 for @xmath167 .",
    "note that @xmath168 in line  2 are the restrictions to the blocks of @xmath169 of the partitions @xmath168 in line  3 , so @xmath170 .",
    "evidently , @xmath171 is the generalized cumulant associated with the reciprocal descending factorial series . for example , @xmath172 thus , the complete formal expansion for the log permanent is @xmath173 in which @xmath174 for @xmath175 , and zero otherwise .      for a fixed pair of partitions @xmath176 the key scalar",

    "in order to test the adequacy of the determinantal approximation , 5000  random matrices @xmath3 of order 1025 were generated , and the exact values @xmath196 were computed using the ryser algorithm .",
    "the matrices of even order were generated from the distribution @xmath197 . in order to ensure an adequate range of permanental values ,",
    "the parameters @xmath198 were generated randomly and independently from the gamma distribution with mean one on four degrees of freedom , i.e.  @xmath199 .",

    "the alternating pattern of residuals for odd and even  @xmath1 is a consequence of the block pattern embedded in the matrices of odd order . for both types of matrices",
