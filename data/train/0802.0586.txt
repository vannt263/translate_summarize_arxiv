    "early single - electron - transport devices @xcite were based on conducting grains containing large gate - controlled number of electrons .",
    "a grain was coupled by tunnel barriers to two macroscopic leads . with number of electrons on the grain being large",
    ", superconductivity could be induced in the grain @xcite upon lowering the temperature , while the leads remained either normal @xcite or also turned into a superconducting state @xcite .",
    "the focus of the early studies was the interplay between the two low - energy @xcite scales , namely , the charging energy and the superconducting gap .",
    "this interplay manifested itself in the coulomb - blockade oscillations . on the theoretical side , different regimes of transport via superconducting grain @xcite",
    "were studied for experimentally relevant situation of a grain containing many electrons .    in the later experiments",
    "the grains have been replaced by much smaller few - electron quantum dots , based either on @xmath6 @xcite or carbon nanotubes @xcite . in these devices , there is no superconducting pairing of electrons on the dot .",
    "rather , either one @xcite or both @xcite leads are made of superconducting material .",
    "interesting physics in the s - n - s junctions with superconducting leads is due to the fact @xcite that the andreev process @xcite in these junctions gives rise to a rich subgap structure in the current - voltage characteristics @xcite . when the n - region is a small quantum dot ( or a single resonant level ) coupled by tunneling to the leads , this subgap structure is more pronounced @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the latter case the on - site interaction of two electrons , which in a small dot assumes the role of charging energy , becomes important @xcite .",
    "what makes the s - n - s structures with a resonant level as a n- region particularly interesting , is a delicate interplay of a new energy scale , kondo temperature , which is much smaller than the charging energy , and the superconducting gap .",
    "this interplay is the focus of the very recent experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the results reported in refs . suggest that subgap anomalies in differential conductance , @xmath7 , at biases @xmath8 , where @xmath1 is the superconducting gap , are enhanced in the kondo regime . another intriguing observation made in refs .",
    "is that kondo resonance leads to smearing of the conventional anomalies in @xmath7 at @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies suggest that on - site repulsion affects the subgap structure in the conductance .",
    "however , it is commonly believed that for @xmath10 there is no qualitative difference between the cases when superconducting leads are separated by a barrier or both coupled to a quantum dot . in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate that on - site repulsion manifests itself even for @xmath10 , leading to _ supergap _ anomalies in @xmath7 .",
    "the underlying reason is that , at finite repulsion , _ inelatic _ electron transitions between normal leads become possible @xcite .",
    "these transitions are accompanied by a quasiparticle excitations in the leads .",
    "when one of the leads is superconducting , the minimal energy of the excitation is @xmath1 .",
    "then , in order for electron tunneling from the normal lead to create the excitation in superconducting lead , the bias should exceed @xmath2 .",
    "threshold for inelastic tunneling results in a supergap singularity , @xmath11 , in the n - s conductance , as demonstrated in sect .",
    "iii a. for the same reason , inelastic tunneling between two superconducting leads has a threshold at @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the supergap anomaly in the s - s transport has a step - like form , @xmath12 ( sect .",
    "iv ) , i.e. , it is stronger than in the n - s case .",
    "this is due to the enhancement of the density of states at the edges of the superconducting gap .",
    "in addition , finite temperature , @xmath13 , affects the s - s supergap anomaly only via the temperature dependence of @xmath14 , whereas the n - s supergap anomaly is a universal function of @xmath15 ( sect .",
    "iii a. ) . in sect .",
    "iii b we also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states causes a sharpening of the large - bias transport anomalies @xcite that involve two - electron transitions .",
    "in order to illustrate how the on - site repulsion , @xmath16 , gives rise to the anomalies in the conductance , @xmath7 , we start from an auxiliary problem of the escape of an electron from the occupied localized state ( ls ) into a superconductor . this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . if the energy of the ls , @xmath17 , lies above the upper boundary of the gap , @xmath18 , then the population of the ls , which is occupied at time @xmath19 , decays with @xmath20 as @xmath21 where the decay rate , @xmath22 , is given by the golden - rule expression @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the tunnel matrix element and @xmath25 is the density of states in the superconductor .",
    "( [ dos ] ) applies when @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "our main point is that , for large enough @xmath17 , there exists another _",
    "inelastic _ channel of the electron escape into the continuum .",
    "namely , the escape can be accompanied by excitation of a quasiparticle across the gap .",
    "this process leads to the threshold anomaly in the dependence @xmath26 .",
    "the position of the threshold , @xmath27 , can be found from the following two conditions on the energy , @xmath28 , of electron leaving the ls @xmath29 the first condition ensures that the state into which electron escapes is empty , while the meaning of the second condition is that the energy loss suffered by escaping electron is sufficient to create a quasiparticle . from eq .",
    "( [ conditions ] ) we find the minimal value of @xmath17 @xmath30 inelastic process is enabled by a finite @xmath16 . to see this , we notice that there are two contributions to the amplitude of the process :    \\1 . an electron from the ls tunnels into the state @xmath31 ( i ) ; another electron from the occupied state , @xmath32 , enters the ls ( ii ) , and subsequently tunnels into the empty state @xmath33 .",
    "these steps are illustrated in fig",
    "\\2 . initial and final states are the same as in 1 , while the intermediate steps ( i ) and ( ii ) are interchanged . as a result ,",
    "after the first step , the ls is doubly occupied . in the absence of the on - site repulsion , the two amplitudes , 1 and 2 , would cancel each other identically . at finite @xmath16",
    ", this cancellation does not happen .",
    "note that , for large @xmath34 , the energy denominator corresponding to @xmath35 contains @xmath16 , so that the second amplitude can be neglected .",

    "( [ 3scales ] ) is that the kondo temperature , @xmath247 $ ] , is much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the kondo effect will not developed fully , but rather manifest itself as an enhancement @xmath248 of the conductance at small bias .",
    "recent experimental papers refs . are focused on the domain of parameters @xmath249 , where the two prominent regimes of transport compete with each other .",
    "this competition is due to the fact that antiparrallel spins of electrons in the cooper pairs can not mediate the spin - flip processes that are responsible for the kondo effect .",
    "experimentally , in the case of normal leads , the kondo effect manifests itself on the stability diagram in the @xmath250 plane as enhanced zero - bias conductance in the valley @xmath251 , where ls is occupied .",
    "it has no effect on the valley @xmath252 . on the other hand , with superconducting leads",
    ", conductance is suppressed in the entire domain of biases @xmath253 in both valleys",
    ". a non - trivial result of interplay between the kondo effect and superconductivity is that the peaks at @xmath254 emerge in the kondo valleys , whereas the conventional peaks at @xmath9 are suppressed @xcite .",
    "this implies that the andreev transport process is facilitated by the kondo resonance .",
    "conversely , in the non - kondo valleys , the peaks @xmath254 do not show up , while @xmath9-peaks are strong and exhibit a well - known threshold behavior , reflecting the bsc density of states .    in the present paper",
    "we predict additional anomalies _ both _ outside the kondo regime and above the gap .",
    "nevertheless , the origin of the new anomalies is intimately related to the kondo physics . to clarify this relation ,",
    "we recall that , in a _ bulk _",
    "metal with magnetic impurities the energy exchange between electrons is possible even without direct electron - electron interaction .",
    "this was first demonstrated by kaminski and glazman in ref .  .",
    "obviously , such an exchange is impossible in the case of non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the reason is that the mechanism , which is responsible for an impurity ( ls ) being magnetic , is a finite on - site repulsion , @xmath16 . as a result , the interaction between two electrons in metal , leading to the energy exchange , takes place when they _ virtually _ visit the ls .",
    "the energy exchange occurs between electrons with opposite spins , and in the case of magnetic impurity , involves spin - flips  @xcite . thus the mechanism ref",
    ".   represents the most elementary manifestation of the kondo physics , and even does not require the presence of the fermi sea .    as was demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the mechanism  @xcite can be extended to the transport between two normal leads , coupled to the ls .",
    "then , for two electrons tunneling between the leads , the magnitude of the energy exchange is limited by the applied bias , @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to the anomalies in conductance at @xmath168 .",
    "the main message of the present paper is that , in the case when one or both leads are superconducting , the gap , @xmath1 , sets the threshold for inelastic process of one - electron transfer accompanied by a quasiparticle excitation in the superconducting lead .",
    "the ensuing anomalies at @xmath255 ( for n and s leads ) and at @xmath239 ( for s - s leads ) are independent of the gate voltage , @xmath17 .",
    "the anomaly near @xmath256 is not smeared by temperature and manifests itself as a sharp peak in the second derivative @xmath257 .",
    "although the papers on transport through coulomb - blockaded dots report the data on first derivative , i.e. , the differential conductance , @xmath258 , the second derivative was previously measured for single - electron transport through a molecule @xcite . in ref .",
    "the second derivative was required to resolve a fine structure in the @xmath259-dependence , related to the vibrational satellites .    as a final remark",
    ", we note that higher - order , in parameters , @xmath260 , @xmath261 processes will lead to anomalies at even larger biases due to creation of more than one quasiparticle by a tunneling electron . for the case of",
    "the s - s leads , additional anomalies can be expected at biases @xmath262 .",
    "estimate for the behavior of inelastic current @xmath263 can be easily found by extending the four - fold integral in eq .",
    "( [ 4e ] ) to higher @xmath264 .",
    "this yields : @xmath265 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with e.  g.   mishchenko and f.  von  oppen .",
    "the fact that the superconductivity manifests itself in the expression eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) for the tunneling rate @xmath26 _ only _ through the density of states eq .",
    "( [ dos ] ) is well known .",
    "however , it is not obvious that higher - order , in the tunnel matrix element , @xmath24 , corrections to @xmath26 can be expressed solely through @xmath200 , and do not contain coherence factors .",
    "indeed , in our calculations we treated the amplitude , @xmath266 , eq .",
    "( [ amplitude1 ] ) as a number determined only by the energies @xmath267 of initial and final states _ in superconductor _ , and ignored the fact that the real amplitude contains contributions of positive and negative bare energies @xmath268 .",

    "( [ disp ] ) and @xmath270^{1/2},\\ ] ] for the lower branch in eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) . then , when performing summation over states corresponding to , say , upper branch , one has to take into account contributions @xmath271 and @xmath272 , since they correspond to the same energy @xmath273 .",
    "now the fact that the main contribution @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to the lifetime does not contain coherence factors can be formally interpreted as a consequence of the identity @xmath274 .    turning to the third - order amplitude eq .",
    "( [ amplitude1 ] ) , the correct way to write one particular contribution to @xmath275 is @xmath276 then the correction @xmath58 is , actually , the sum of all possible contributions , i.e. , @xmath277 from eq .",
