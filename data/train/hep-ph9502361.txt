    "a variety of predictions concerning chiral symmetry breaking and concerning the lightest hadrons in various channels can be made within the instanton liquid model .",

    "the quark propagator in the background of one instanton in the well known regular and singular gauge is compared to a gauge invariant ( gi ) propagator , for which explicit expressions are calculated in this work .",
    "the rest of section [ sec1 ] contains a summary of well known instanton formulas , which are used in the subsequent sections .",
    "the solutions of the euclidian yang - mills equations fall into topology classes @xmath1 and are called @xmath2 instanton  solutions .",
    "the one instanton solution has the well - known form a_i^a(x ) & = & o_i^ab_b^q_i ( x - z_i)_(x - z_i)^2 2 ^ 2 ( x - z_i)^2+^2   + a_i^a(x ) & = & o_i^ab_b^-q_i 2(x - z_i)_(x - z_i)^2+^2   + _ i=(z_i , o_i,_i , q_i)&= & the parameters @xmath3 of the instanton simply reflect the symmetries of the lagrangian ( translation , rotation , scale invariance , parity ) . the partition function in semiclassical approximation is @xcite,@xcite @xmath4 @xmath5 is the density of instantons of size @xmath6 , @xmath7 the running coupling constant , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the classical instanton action and @xmath11 is the unrenormalized tree level coupling constant .",
    "whenever @xmath11 appears in some formulas , one has to guess its value .",
    "this unlucky situation may be improved by using the two loop expression for @xmath5 replacing @xmath10 by @xmath12 and @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "but this is only an improvement for a small coupling .",
    "when @xmath6 reaches the qcd scale @xmath14 one should rely on a low order calculation to have a chance to get sensible results .",
    "the sum of widely separated instantons is also an approximate solution of the ym equations .",
    "@xmath15\\approx ns_0\\ ] ] the partition function of this so called instanton gas is @xmath16 the sum is dominated by an instanton density @xmath17 . unfortunately @xmath18 is infinite and the assumption of a dilute instanton gas is inconsistent .",
    "this infinite density is caused by the divergence of @xmath5 for large @xmath6 , which in fact is a consequence of the increasing coupling constant at large distances .",
    "there were several suggestions to overcome this problem .",
    "the most primitive is to introduce a cut - off @xmath19 and ignore large instantons : @xmath20 the cut - off is chosen small enough to make the spacetime fraction @xmath21 filled with instantons less than 1 so that the dilute gas model is justified @xmath22 this simple cut - off procedure can be improved by introducing a scale invariant hardcore repulsion between instantons , which effectively supresses large instantons @xcite .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of respecting the scaling ward identities which are otherwise violated by the simple cut - off ansatz . in @xcite",
    "such an repulsion has been found leading to a phenomenologically welcomed packing fraction .",
    "unfortunately this repulsion is an artefact of the sum - ansatz as has been shown by @xcite .",
    "therefore the infrared problem is still unsolved .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to make successful predictions by simply assuming a certain instanton density and some average radius .",
    "this instanton liquid model has been very successful in describing the physics of light hadrons @xcite,@xcite .    in high energy processes involving momenta @xmath23 of @xmath24gev , @xmath5",
    "is usually multiplied by a function sharply peaked at @xmath25 .",
    "the integral over @xmath6 is now dominated by small instantons and infrared convergent .",
    "the results are therefore independent of the cut - off and no model has to be invented .",
    "gauge symmetry is a rather large symmetry , an infinite product of @xmath26 in the case of qcd .",
    "a physicist is always happy of having symmetries because they can be exploited to make predictions even without solving the theory .",
    "gauge symmetry is neccessary to get a physical vector particle spectrum .",
    "as long as one does not make an approximation which manifestly breaks gauge symmetry one can choose a comfortable gauge for calculations because the result is gi .",
    "but it is very difficult _ not _ to break gi , especially in a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "it is not easy to find a gi regularization and furthermore , the gluon propagator , the primary object in perturbation theory , is not gi .",
    "of course it is meanwhile well known how to perform gi calculations in every order perturbation theory using fp - ghosts and dimensional regularization .",
    "every new approach beyond perturbation theory is again confronted with the problem of gi . in lattice theory",
    "the wilson action had to be invented .",
    "in schwinger - dyson and bethe - salpeter type selfconsistency equations gi is still an open problem . in instanton physics when going beyond the one instanton approximation the choice of gauge is also important .",
    "this will be discussed in the next paragraph .",
    "there is a related problem when considering non - gi objects from the very beginning like the gluon or quark propagator . strictly speaking",
    "they are only _ defined _ when relying to a certain gauge . in principle",
    "one should not give them any physical meaning at all .",
    "often one is tempted to do so and therefore it is necessary to give some motivation of choosing this or that gauge .",
    "the gauge field @xmath27 describes the connection between neighbouring vector bundles over the spacetime manifold @xmath28 .",
    "thus a choice of gauge is like the choice of a coordinate system in general relativity with connection @xmath29 . when choosing a crooked coordinate system ,",
    "although being in a smooth universe , there will appear fictitious accelerations towering above the real physical accelerations @xmath30 when making general covariant calculations these fictitious accelerations and the @xmath31 contribution will cancel out thus leading to the correct small result .",
    "but the slightest unsystematic approximation will produce gross errors .",
    "the natural solution of this problem is to use a coordinate system as smooth as possible to avoid fictitious accelerations , e.g. to choose @xmath29 as small as possible . to make this statement more quantitative",
    "we may try to minimize @xmath32 simultaneously for all curves .",
    "this is done by choosing a coordinate system which minimizes @xmath33 this obviously measures the crookedness of the coordinate system .",
    "let us now transfere this to qcd .",
    "the analog norm for the gauge potential is @xmath34 a stationary point is found by variating @xmath35 w.r.t",
    ". gauge transformations @xmath36+\\partial_\\mu\\omega",
    "\\quad,\\quad    \\delta ||a||^2 = 2i\\int tr(\\partial_\\mu a^\\mu)\\omega d^4\\!x = 0    \\quad \\forall\\omega    \\quad\\gdw\\quad    \\partial_\\mu a^\\mu = 0\\ ] ] therefore in lorentz gauge , @xmath27 contains as few pure gauge as possible , if the stationary point is a minimum .",
    "an expansion in @xmath37 is thus most rapidly convergent in lorentz gauge . in applications where @xmath37 is not needed in total e.g. when only a certain momentum region is probed , different norms and different gauges",
    "may be optimal in the sense discussed above .",
    "especially one should include derivatives of @xmath37 into the norm in order to guarantee a smooth @xmath37 which is important for high energies .      when calculating gi quantities in the background of one instanton in a gi way the choice of gauge is only a matter of convenience .",
    "but one can see that there are large cancelations between different terms in regular gauge at large distances due to their slow decay and in singular gauge at small distances due to the topological singularity at the instanton center . for non - gi",
    "invariant quantities like the gluon or quark propagator , or when making some unsystematic approximation , the lesson is to use singular / regular gauge when dealing with low / high energies to avoid these cancelations .",
    "this is consistent with the discussion given above .",
    "singular as well as regular gauge fulfill the lorentz condition .",
    "@xmath38 is finite and a minimum .",
    "@xmath39 is therefore a good choice for low energies . for high energies",
    "it is important to have a smooth @xmath37 which is obviously only satisfied by the regular gauge .    to linearly superpone instantons they have to decay rapidly enough .",
    "therefore one has to use singular gauge .",
    "this argument can in principle be circumvented by superponing two fields @xmath40 and @xmath41 the former / latter being an exact multi - instanton / anti - instanton configuration in regular gauge . despite this , for low energies singular",
    "gauge is in any case a good choice and for high energies a one instanton approximation is already a good approximation .",
    "a specific example to test the gauge dependence is the quark propagator .",
    "the contribution of one instanton of radius @xmath6 to @xmath42 which usually is interpreted as a constituent quark mass is shown in figure [ fig1 ] in regular , singular and axial gauge .",
    "the regular graph is larger than the singular at low momentum and the singular graph shows the slow decay ( only polynomial in @xmath43 ) for large momenta .",
    "the analytical expressions are well known and are listed in appendix [ appa ] together with expressions in axial gauge which will be derived and discussed below .",
    "a correlator containing color - non - singlet operators can be made gi by connecting distant points with a special path - ordered exponential containing the gauge field .",
    "the exponential ensures the parallel transport of color from one point to the other .",
    "the gi quark propagator may symbolically written as [ gi31 ] s_ax(x , y ) = 0|(x ) p(i_x^y dza(z ) )    @xmath44 to be its color singlet part because only the singlet part is gi .",
    "@xmath44 will be called the axial propagator because in axial gauge with @xmath45 the exponential vanishes . in the one instanton background in zeromode approximation",
    "we get @xmath46\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is now the instanton field and @xmath47 is the zeromode in any gauge . in a coordinate system where the instanton sits at the origin and @xmath48",
    "is in time direction ( time , space ) . ]",
    "@xmath49 the path ordered exponential reduces to an ordinary exponential .",
    "alternatively we could have tried to find a gauge transformation which transforms the regular gauge in axial gauge .",
    "in both cases we get : [ gi33 ] s_ax(x , y ) & = & 1n_ctr_c , _",
    "ax(x ) = r(x)_reg(x ) , + [ gi34 ] r(x ) & = & e^i(x ) * * |*x*| = ( x)i * * |*x*| ( x ) = : i_^ ( x ) + [ gi35 ] ( x ) & = & |*x*| @xmath50 may also be written in a covariant form @xmath51 but now @xmath50 depends also on @xmath52 and the expression for the propagator no longer factorizes .",
    "the reason for this is that the axial gauge is not covariant , but the definition of the propagator is . inserting ( [ gi34 ] ) and",
    "( [ gi86 ] ) into ( [ gi33 ] ) we get [ gi36 ] s_ax(x , y ) = 1n_c ( ( ) - 12__^ ) 1_52_reg(x)_reg(y ) inserting ( [ gi34 ] ) , ( [ gi35 ] ) and ( [ gi86 ] ) into ( [ gi36 ] ) the space - time averaged propagator can be expressed as an integral over elementary functions @xmath53\\cdot\\ ] ] @xmath54 the difference between the propagator in regular and axial gauge is the insertion of the @xmath55 $ ] factor .",
    "therefore the axial propagator is everywhere smaller than the regular propagator , except at @xmath56 where they coincide because the path - ordered exponential is one . at large distances",
    "it is smaller by a factor @xmath57 . instead of performing the integration in coordinate space ,",

    "@xmath72 plotted in figure [ fig1 ] we see that the axial @xmath61 lies somewhat in between the regular and the singular .",
    "so one may conclude that axial gauge is a good compromise for all momenta .",
    "the calculation of the gi propagator seems to make the discussion of its gauge dependent partners obsolet .",
    "i will now argue that this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that there are a huge number of gi definitions of a quark propagator and ( [ gi31 ] ) is only one possible choice .",
    "one obvious generalization is to choose a more complicated path from @xmath73 to @xmath52 than a straight line .",
    "the next thing one could do is not to restrict oneself to a specific path , but to take into account all paths one is interested in and average the results with arbitrary weights .",
    "another possibility is to let the path depend on the gauge field itself , as long as this choice is made in a gi way .",
    "finally one can combine both generalizations .",
    "i am sure that it is possible to produce any result for the propagator with a suitable generalized definition .",
    "the advantage of the standard axial propagator is , that the definition is simple and that the non local operator has a physical interpretation .",
    "it creates a quark - antiquark pair connected by a thin gluon flux tube .",
    "this might be a good choice for a non - local meson creation operator .",
    "but it is also plausible that one of the generalizations given above is even better .",
    "the only thing i want to point out is , that the gi definition for the propagator given above is nothing more than to work in axial gauge .",
    "one still has to choose the right gauge using more sophisticated arguments .",
    "the only reason for performing the @xmath74 limit is to make the @xmath75 dependence of the resulting formulas simple .",
    "the accuracy has been checked to be within the standard 10% for @xmath76 usually achieved by @xmath77 expansion . here",
