    "as exemplified by the presentations of this 2002 edition of the  beauty  conference , cp violation is currently the focus of a great deal of attention .",
    "the results of the b - factories @xcite measure @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cp - phase between the top and charm sides of the ( bd ) unitarity triangle @xcite . to within the experimental sensitivity ,",
    "the ckm mechanism @xcite of the standard theory is verified . in this description ,",
    "all the cp - violating observables depend on a unique phase in the quark mixing matrix .",
    "any inconsistency between two independent determinations of the cp - phase is an indication for new physics .",
    "two main reasons for the search of new physics in cp - violating observables are :    \\i )  the dynamic generation of the baryonic asymmetry in the universe requires cp - violation , and its magnitude in the standard model looks insufficient .",
    "\\ii )  essentially all extensions of the standard model introduce new sectors with additional sources of cp - phases .",
    "the examples that i will consider here to search for new physics are based on the following attitude : the decays dominated by standard model diagrams at tree level with w - exchange allow the extraction of @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . on the contrary",
    ", new physics will be apparent in processes which , for the standard model , are described by loop diagrams , like @xmath7 and @xmath8 mixing or penguin amplitudes . in so doing , i will cover cases which are appropriate for b - factories , as well as others which need hadronic machines .    in section [ section2 ]",
    "i discuss coherent correlated decays of @xmath0 s in order to build ( besides cp - odd asymmetries ) t - odd and cpt - odd observables .",
    "section [ section3 ] is devoted to temporal asymmetries which need absorptive parts and are a signal of a non - vanishing @xmath9 in @xmath0 decays . in section [ section4 ]",
    "i discuss @xmath1-mixing .",
    "the decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 are presented in section [ section5 ] as ways to search for new physics .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in section [ section6 ] .",
    "in a b - factory operating at the @xmath12 peak , correlated pairs of neutral b - mesons are produced .",
    "this permits the performance of either a flavour tag or a cp tag . to @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the wolfenstein parameter @xcite in the quark mixing matrix",
    ", the determination of the single @xmath15-state is possible and unambiguous @xcite .",
    "any final configuration ( x , y ) , where x , y are decay channels which are either flavour or cp conserving , corresponds to a single particle mesonic transition .",
    "the intensity for the final configuration @xmath16 is thus proportional to the time dependent probability for the meson transition .",
    "the case @xmath17 associated with the @xmath18 transition is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we consider genuine asymmetries for cp , t and cpt operations , in the sense that a non - vanishing value is a proof of the violation of the symmetry .",
    "two cases are of particular interest :    \\i ) * flavour - to - flavour transitions *    the final configuration denoted by ( @xmath19 ) , with flavour definite ( for example , semileptonic ) decays detected on both sides of the detector , corresponds to flavour - to - flavour transitions at the meson level .",
    "the equivalence is shown in table [ tabla1 ] .",
    "the first two processes in the table are conjugated under cp and also under t.    .flavour - to - flavour transitions [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the exact limit @xmath20 , @xmath21 and t operations , although different ( compare the second lines of tables [ tabla2 ] and [ tabla3 ] ) , are found to become equivalent , so that the temporal asymmetries satisfy @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the asymmetries @xmath24 and @xmath25 are non - genuine , so that the presence of @xmath26 may induce non - vanishing values for them , even in the absence of true t or cpt violation . these effects can be calculated and are thus controllable .",
    "this reasoning leads to an interesting suggestion : * there are linear terms in * @xmath9 *  inducing a non - vanishing asymmetry * @xmath27 .",
    "this last asymmetry is particularly clean , under the reasonable assumption that @xmath28 .",
    "explicit calculations @xcite show that , even in the limit of perfect symmetry , i.e. , @xmath29 besides @xmath30 , one finds a non - vanishing @xmath31-asymmetry , given by    @xmath32    the simple result ( [ 8 ] ) is modified under the realistic @xmath33 situation .",
    "one has , if only @xmath30 , the result    @xmath34    @xmath35    the three terms of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) contain different @xmath21-dependences , so that a good time resolution will allow the determination of the parameters .",
    "taking into account that @xmath36 , all of the three terms are linear in @xmath9 .",
    "we conclude that the comparison between the channels @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a good method to obtain information on @xmath9 , due to the absence of any non - vanishing difference when @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 are not mass eigenstates , so that their oscillation frequency is governed by their mass - difference .",
    "the measurement by the ua1 collaboration @xcite of a large value of @xmath42 was historically the first indication of the heavy top quark mass .",
    "this is so because of non - decoupling effects of the heavy - mass exchange in the box diagram . for @xmath43 ,",
    "it is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .    to avoid many hadronic uncertainties ,",
    "it is interesting to consider the ratio between @xmath44 and @xmath42 , given by @xcite    @xmath45    where @xmath46  is the flavour - su(3 ) breaking parameter in terms of the meson decay constants and the bag factors .",
    "@xmath47  if one uses a vacuum saturation of the hadronic matrix element .",
    "the great advantage of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is that , in the ratio , different systematics in the evaluation of the matrix element tends to cancel out .",
    "however , unlike @xmath48 @xmath49 , which is measured with a good precision @xcite , the determination of @xmath44 is an experimental challenge due to the rapid oscillation of the @xmath50 . at present @xcite , @xmath51 , with 95%c.l . , but this bound already provides a strong constraint on @xmath52 .",
    "the use of qcd spectral sum rules leads to @xcite .",
    "@xmath53    in agreement with the present experimental lower bound and within the reach of the proposed experiments .",
    "ali and london @xcite have examined the situation for susy theories with minimal flavour violation . in this class of models , the susy contributions to @xmath42 and @xmath44 can both be described by a single common parameter @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55   \\label{12 } \\\\",
    "\\delta m_{s } & = & \\delta m_{s}(sm)[1+f]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the parameter @xmath54 is positive definite , so that the susy contributions add constructively to the sm contributions in the entire allowed supersymmetric parameter space .",
    "the size of @xmath54 depends , in general , on the parameters of the susy model .",
    "they conclude that , if @xmath56 is measured to be near its lower limit , susy with large @xmath54 is disfavoured .    with respect to the values of the cp phases @xmath57 , @xmath3 and @xmath58 of the unitarity triangle ,",
    "the key observation is that a measurement of @xmath59 will not distinguish among the various values of @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath3 is rather independent of @xmath54 .",
    "if one wants to distinguish among the various susy models , it will be necessary to measure @xmath58 and/or @xmath57 independently .",
    "contrary to these susy models , in which the ratio @xmath60 remains that of the standard model , left - right - symmetric models with spontaneous cp violation modify @xmath44 and @xmath42 with different phases relative to the sm contribution .",
    "one has @xcite",
    "@xmath61    as a consequence , the ratio is modified with respect to the sm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analysis of the joint constraints imposed by @xmath62 and @xmath63 is performed , with the conclusion that the left - right model favours opposite signs of @xmath64 and @xmath2 and it would be disfavoured for @xmath65 . a test of the @xmath43 would be crucial in this context .",
    "the general argument of considering cp - violation in @xmath43 as a prime candidate for new physics is well defined . in @xmath68 ,",
    "the sm amplitudes of mixing ( dominated by the virtual top quark ) @xmath69 and decay @xmath70 define a relative phase @xmath3 of the order of one , because the corresponding unitarity triangle satisfies the scales of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "contrary to this standard @xmath3 , the sm amplitudes for @xmath71 satisfy that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , so that the corresponding unitarity triangle is shown in figure [ fig4 ] and the relative phase @xmath74 is tiny , of the order of @xmath75 .",
    "it does not take much new physics to change the tiny standard @xmath74 !    in hadronic machines ,",
    "substantial number of @xmath10 events are expected .",
    "the decay process is described by three lorentz invariant terms , two cp - even terms and one cp - odd term .",
    "the joint angular distibution with @xmath76 and @xmath77 has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the aim of separating out the definite cp eigenstates and thus recovering a cp asymmetry free of cancellations .    following the argument of the introduction ,",
    "candidates for new physics are processes which , in the sm , are described by either mixing or penguin amplitudes in the decay . in left - right models ,",
    "the gluonic penguin contribution to @xmath78 transition is enhanced by @xmath79 due to the presence of right - handed currents .",
    "this may overcome the suppression due to small left - right mixing angle .",
    "two new phases @xcite in the @xmath80 decay amplitude may therefore modify the time dependent cp asymmetry in this decay mode by o(1 ) .",
    "this scenario implies also large cp asymmetry in the decay @xmath81 which can be tested in hadronic machines .",
    "the prospects for an experimental study of the flavour problem in the next coming years are much interesting , from cp - violating observables in b - factories and hadronic machines",
    ". the ( bd ) unitarity triangle will be tested , with separate determinations of the cp - phases ( @xmath57 , @xmath3 , @xmath58 ) , after the present establishment of cp - violation in @xmath0 -physics .",
    "new phenomena are probably around the corner .",
    "discoveries like t - violation in b - physics , without any contamination of absorptive parts , and sensitive limits ( or spectacular surprises ) for cpt - violation are expected .",
    "temporal asymmetries in b - decays are a good method to search for linear terms in @xmath82 .",
    "the intensities @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are predicted to be equal under cpt invariance and @xmath20 .",
    "linear terms in @xmath9 induce a non - vanishing asymmetry for this cp @xmath21 transformation .",
    "@xmath43 is considered to be of prime importance for the search of new physics , particularly in its cp - violating component .",
    "extended models modify the tiny phase between the top and charm sides of the standard ( bs ) unitarity triangle .",
    "the non - decoupling effects of new physics can be put under control by the cancellation of hadronic matrix element uncertainties in the ratio @xmath60 .",
    "the interest in a detailed analysis of @xmath10 is apparent in this context .",
    "new physics in penguin - mediated decays , like @xmath87 and @xmath81 , is also expected , with information complementary to that of mixing .",
    "all in all , we can expect a beautiful future in front of us !",
    "i would like to thak e. alvarez , p. ball , d. binosi , f.botella , j. matias , m.nebot and j. papavassiliou for interesting discussions and to the organizers of  beauty 2002  for their invitation to such a beautiful event in santiago .",
