    "the lhc has completed its first full year of collecting data and searching for new physics in 7 tev proton - proton collisions .",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations conducted an impressive series of searches for supersymmetry ( susy ) at the lhc looking for squarks and gluinos in final states containing jets and missing transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "the latest of these analyses are based on @xmath2 of data taken in the first half of 2011  @xcite .",
    "so far , these searches have shown no evidence for susy ( nor for any other new physics ) .",
    "this fact by itself does not imply the demise of supersymmetry , it rather points out that new physics was not ` hiding around the corner ' and more work is needed to uncover it . in this paper",
    "we will assess the impact of these searches for general gauge mediated ( ggm ) susy breaking models with long - lived next - to - lightest supersymmetric particles ( nlsps ) .",
    "interpretations of the latest lhc data in terms of other phenomenological models are given in  @xcite .",
    "here , we will derive the exclusion contours arising from the atlas zero - lepton search for susy at @xmath0 @xcite , henceforth ` jets + met ' , and compare with the lep higgs bounds  @xcite .",
    "we will argue that for ggm models with low - to - moderate values of @xmath3 , the higgs bounds are still the strongest bounds in sizable areas of parameter space . as such for this classes of models",
    "supersymmetry searches at the lhc are only beginning .",
    "figure  [ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] summarises our main findings for the lhc susy and lep higgs exclusion contours in models of general gauge mediation and references therein for details on ggm . ] in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "we plot both sets of exclusions on the plane of physical squark ( vertical axis ) and gluino masses ( horizontal axis ) .",
    "the left panel shows ggm with lower messenger masses of @xmath4 gev , and the right panel shows a high - messenger - mass case with @xmath5 gev .",
    "the susy exclusion contours in ggm are derived from @xmath0 of data collected by the atlas collaboration in their searches for jets and missing transverse momentum ( met ) in proton - proton collisions at 7 tev with zero leptons in the final state @xcite .",
    "we obtain these susy exclusion contours following the same strategy as in @xcite .",
    "as will be explained in more detail in the following section , we use  @xcite to simulate events in ggm and  @xcite to implement the experimental cuts used by atlas in @xcite .",
    "the resulting signal rates of ggm are then compared to data .",
    "the data strongly constrains events with missing energy carried for example by a neutralino nlsp . in sizable regions of ggm parameter space",
    "the nlsp is the stau ( rather than the neutralino ) , which we take to be stable on collider scales . in our analysis",
    "we use a conservative approach to the data by assuming that events with long - lived stau nlsps will not give met signatures and thus will not be constrained . in these regions",
    "one should instead use the dedicated searches for long - lived charged particles .",

    "the curve follows the boundary between neutralino and stau nlsp regions . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] the stau nlsp region grows at large @xmath3 because the stau mass is reduced by its yukawa coupling , which increases with @xmath3 .",

    "this case has been studied , e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "an example is a bino - like neutralino decaying into a photon and gravitino . in this case",
    "it is more appropriate to rely on the dedicated met searches with two photons in the final state @xcite",
    ". these are more sensitive than the inclusive jets + met searches , since the missing transverse momentum is halved when each neutralino can decay into a photon and a gravitino ( with only the latter carrying the met ) . in the present paper we concentrate on long - lived nlsps .",

    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] as dashed lines in red , black and blue , for @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively . the position of the higgs exclusion contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] shows significant dependence on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is as expected , since the tree level contribution to the mass of the lightest higgs is @xmath15 , which decreases with decreasing @xmath1 , making it harder to satisfy the lep lower bound on the higgs mass . in order to fulfill this bound ,",
    "as is well known , one needs large loop corrections from the stop . at one - loop level ( see e.g. @xcite ) one has , @xmath16 , \\label{mh - sq - primer}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cosine and sine of the stop mixing angle .    to compensate for the tree level deficit at lower values of @xmath3",
    "we need sufficiently large stop masses which makes the higgs exclusion contours more powerful , i.e. they exclude larger portions of the parameter space .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] we see that in the ggm susy framework with not too high values of @xmath3 , the current lhc searches for supersymmetry based on missing transverse momentum with jets and zero leptons in the final state have only just started to be competitive with the higgs exclusions from lep . in these scenarios we are not surprised that susy has not yet been discovered at lhc .",
    "we note however , that the jets + met searches exclude even decoupled squarks for sufficiently light gluinos ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is a region where the higgs exclusion can not compete .",
    "the area of susy parameter space least probed and constrained by jets+met susy searches is the area with a charged nlsp , in ggm notably the stau .",
    "this has already been noted in  @xcite and can be seen very clearly from fig .",
    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] .",
    "the higgs exclusion holds regardless of the nlsp identity .",
    "therefore , it is crucial that the data from dedicated searches for charged massive particles started in  @xcite can be interpreted in terms of general classes of susy models .    to what extent",
    "is the relative prominence of the higgs exclusion in ggm different from other susy models , in particular from the much studied example of the cmssm ?",
    "an important distinctive feature of all gauge mediation models in this context is the absence ( or more precisely the loop - level suppression ) of the trilinear soft @xmath20-terms at the high scale .",
    "this is not the case in gravity mediation models . in the cmssm",
    "the @xmath20-coupling at the gut scale is given by @xmath21 which is a free parameter .     and",
    "the messenger scale @xmath22 .",
    "the diagonals delimiting the excluded areas in each case arise from one of the following two effects .",
    "either the nlsp ( in gauge mediation models ) changes from a neutralino to a stau , for which our implementation of the atlas jets + met search has no sensitivity , or we simply reach a region in the gluino - squark mass plane which is theoretically inaccessible  @xcite.,width=396 ]    we now switch to the cmssm and compare the jets + met exclusion with the lep higgs exclusion at different @xmath3 and @xmath21 .",
    "the insensitivity of the former to these variables in the cmssm was shown in @xcite .",
    "higgs bounds however depend on both .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : cmssm - sq - gl - plane ] . in the left panel",
    "we show @xmath12 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 for constant @xmath11 , and we reach similar conclusions as for the gauge mediation case discussed above . in the right panel",
    "we vary @xmath21 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the usual cmssm scalar mass parameter ) , keeping @xmath26 fixed .",
    "the variation of @xmath21 affects the value of the higgs mass and the relevance of the higgs exclusion contour .",
    "the reason is that negative ( positive ) @xmath27 increases ( decreases ) stop mixing and thus the physical higgs mass ( see eq .  ) , making the higgs searches less ( more ) constraining .    in this sense , for the cmssm and related models , the lep higgs bound provides a stronger constraint than jets + met searches only in a part of the parameter space , characterised by vanishing or ( moderately ) positive values of @xmath21 .",
    "a common strategy for dealing with the additional parameter @xmath27 is , instead of keeping it fixed , to optimise with respect to it .",
    "in other words one looks for such values of @xmath21 where the susy is least constrained by the higgs ( and , if desired , other experimental inputs  @xcite ) . for ggm models ,",
    "@xmath21 is not a free parameter and there is no simple way of reducing the dominance of the lep higgs exclusion contours ( apart from dialing up @xmath3 ) .",
    "we would like to note that even in models where @xmath27 is a free parameter , the direct searches provide additional sensitivity beyond the higgs bounds only for a certain range of @xmath27 .",
    "as the overall scale probed by the collider increases this range grows as well .",
    "therefore the size of the newly probed parameter space increases rapidly .",
    "again susy searches are just taking off .",
    "the observation that for not too high values of @xmath28 , the available parameter space of general models of gauge mediation is not yet significantly constrained by the current met susy searches at the lhc is one of the main points of this paper .",
    "the ongoing searches of supersymmetry at the lhc are entering the crucial discovery phase , but they are far from announcing the demise of supersymmetry .",
    "the details of our analysis leading to the implementation and interpretation of the lhc susy searches for ggm models as well as the validation of this implementation for the known cmssm case will be presented in the following section .",
    "there we also explain how the higgs bounds were derived . before moving on ,",
    "however , we note that the jets + met exclusion shows little model dependence provided the neutralino is stable on detector scales . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmssm - ggm - comb ] we show this exclusion in terms of physical squark and gluino masses both for the cmssm and for ggm with low and high values of @xmath3 and of the messenger scale @xmath22 . as one can clearly see the variations in the relative positions of the contours are not dramatic . the position of the turning point where stau becomes lighter than the neutralino and the resulting slope do however depend on the model .",
    "our approach in implementing and validating the latest @xmath0 atlas met search constraints for a general bsm model follows the general strategy laid out in ref .",
    "@xcite and uses a combination of , and .",
    "-1 cm    a monte carlo event generator , in our case  @xcite , is used to compute signal rates from any given bsm model , in our case ggm ( or cmssm for validation ) with mass spectra calculated by  @xcite .",
    "our implementation of the experimental event selection used by atlas in @xcite , defining five different signal regions , was done in the  @xcite analysis framework . since the matrix elements implemented in general purpose monte carlo event generators are only accurate to leading order in perturbative qcd , we supplement the acceptance calculated with with an nlo cross section calculated with  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we use to simulate three sets of supersymmetric particle production processes for each point in susy parameter space : a ) squark and gluino production , b ) the production of an electroweak gaugino in association with a squark or gluino and c ) the production of slepton and electroweak gaugino pairs",
    ". the fraction of events passing the experimental cuts in each channel was then used together with the cross section calculated using to obtain the number of signal events passing the cuts for each of the five signal regions .",
    "the maximum allowed number of signal events in each signal region is provided by atlas  @xcite .",
    "comparing our numbers of events calculated in a given susy model point with this number decides whether the model point is allowed or excluded .    to validate our implementation",
    "we simulate the same cmssm plane in the five signal regions presented by atlas in ref .",
    "@xcite and compare our exclusion with theirs . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : validate ] we obtain excellent agreement between our exclusion contours and theirs . having implemented the same kinematic cuts and selections as atlas this consistency means that the detector efficiencies are relatively close to one in the relevant kinematic regions .",
    "this makes us confident that our analysis , which does not use a detector simulation , can be applied to the ggm case . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite an efficiency factor is needed to account for loss of jet energy .",
    "we have included a factor of 0.85 for the four of five signal regions with softer cuts on the jet @xmath29 ( i.e. excluding the high mass region the position of this contour has large uncertainties . ] ) to account for this and give a minor improvement .      to check exclusion by higgs - based searches",
    ", we used the superpartner spectrum computed by with feynhiggs 2.8.5  @xcite to accurately calculate further details of the higgs sector , in particular decay cross - sections .",
    "this information was passed to higgsbounds 3.5.0beta  @xcite to compare with current experimental limits from lep , the tevatron and the lhc ( version 3.5.0 includes data from the eps - hep-2011 , leptonphoton-2011 , and susy-2011 conferences ) .",
    "higgsbounds returns @xmath30 for the search channel with the highest statistical sensitivity : a ratio greater than @xmath31 indicates @xmath32 confidence - level exclusion .",
    "this approach has the rigour of monte carlo based exclusion  in comparing cross - sections to their limits rather than using model - dependent mass limits  whilst only taking a time comparable to the generation of the mass spectrum itself . in our case",
    "we see only the lep lower bound , @xmath33 , for an sm - like higgs .",

    ", a stau would leave a track and therefore would nt be counted as missing energy . similarly if the neutralino decays inside the detector into , say , a photon and a gravitino , then less missing energy is generated ( and the event may also be vetoed due to the presence of photons ) . for these reasons the zero - lepton jets + met",
    "searches are primarily aimed at and are most sensitive to long - lived neutralinos .",

    "let us conclude with a brief discussion of what happens if we allow for six different @xmath44s to span the entire ggm parameter space .",
    "we need to address what happens in this case for both the direct susy search and higgs exclusion contours .",
    "jet + met susy searches depend crucially on three parameters , the mass of the gluinos , the first generation squark mass and the neutralino mass .",
    "the first two are taken into account by presenting our results in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggm - sq - gl - plane ] on the gluino - squark mass plane .",
    "the gluino mass chiefly depends on the parameter @xmath57 . for direct searches",
    "the most relevant squark mass is the lightest one .",
    "this squark mass squared is determined by a certain linear combination of the @xmath58 and the @xmath59 through the rg evolution .",
    "as long as the neutralino remains the nlsp and its mass is not fine - tuned to be very close to the squark and gluino masses , the exclusion limits from direct searches in the gluino - squark mass plane are not affected by a splitting of @xmath44s . on the other hand",
    "if the splitting of @xmath44s changes nlsp species jets + met searches lose sensitivity , as explained earlier .    now the higgs exclusion contour chiefly depends on the stop masses .",
    "since gauge mediation does not distinguish between the generations this mass is directly linked to the mass of the first generation squarks . unless extreme splittings are introduced this is essentially the same squark mass parameter that governs the direct searches .",
    "in addition there is a higher order dependence of the higgs mass on the gluino mass , which is our second parameter . in summary",
    "the same two parameters , squark and gluino mass , are the most relevant ones for both , the direct susy searches and the higss constraints .",
    "showing the results in the plane spanned by these two parameters gives qualitatively the same picture independent of the particular combination of the original high energy parameters , @xmath44 .      to bring the higgs mass in our ggm model up into the region @xmath60 , hinted at by the recent lhc results  @xcite ,",
