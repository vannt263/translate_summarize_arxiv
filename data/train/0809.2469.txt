    "therefore duality investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite is broken here due to additional mass term . in the range @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) we can obtain solutions by the replacement @xmath98 .",
    "then for @xmath99 we have @xmath100 as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "presented solutions are valid in the pre - bounce phase .",
    "later when modes cross the bounce solutions of the equation of motion have a different form . despite the fact that size of horizon diverges at the turning point ( @xmath101 @xmath102 @xmath103 ) the solutions evolve smoothly without any anomalies . in the context of loop cosmology such",
    "a behaviour has been recently approved for gravitational waves based on the analytical and numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "interesting generic feature of the bouncing cosmologies is suppression of power of the low energy models @xcite .",
    "therefore we can expect damping of the low energy modes also for the model studied here .",
    "however it can depend whether condition @xmath75 for validity of the linear approximation is conserved during the whole evolution .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied then nonlinear effects should be also taken into account .",
    "otherwise suppression of power of the low energy modes should be easily obtained .",
    "such an effect is typically presented as a possible explanation of the low cmb multipoles suppression @xcite .",
    "however it seems that fine tuning must occur to match energy scales of the bounce with the cosmological ones at which suppression of the cmb modes is observed .",
    "these issues have to be addressed in the further considerations .    scalar field with potential ( [ potential ] )",
    "is non - gaussian . namely modes with different wave numbers",
    "interact one another @xcite .",
    "since observations suggest that primordial perturbations were nearly gaussian @xcite the cmb nonlinearities can in principle be used to restrict models with interacting potentials . in our case potential of interaction",
    "has non - polynomial form therefore non - gaussian features of the field should be significant .",
    "however since we do not know how many perturbations originate from the short quantum phase ( where model studied here can be applied ) we can not infer about their impact on the cmb nonlinearities . in principle contribution from the phase of bounce",
    "can be affected by the succeed phase of inflation .",
    "detailed studies of this issues are however beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we devote for these issues another paper @xcite while now concentrate only on some preliminary estimations of nonlinear effects .",
    "the lowest order interacting term is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 this term becomes important when dominates the mass one .",
    "therefore ratio @xmath106 can be seen as a measure of non - gaussianity .",
    "here we have defined parameter @xmath107 we show this function in fig .",
    "[ xi ] .     for @xmath108.,width=264 ]    at the points where @xmath109 non - gaussian part becomes dominant since the mass vanishes there . in the limits",
    "@xmath110 the parameter @xmath111 stabilises .",
    "above results indicate that non - gaussian effects can be in fact produced .",
    "especially interesting are points where @xmath109 , then nonlinear effects are dominant .",
    "these regions could be an effective source of the cosmological non - gaussianity .",
    "it is therefore in principle possible to constraint this model from cmb nonlinearities .",
    "this could bring observational bounds on parameter @xmath112 or equivalently barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath113 in this specific model .",
    "however to prove this supposition further detailed analysis is required . in principle bispectrum and",
    "resulting parameter of nonlinearities @xmath114 have to be determined .",
    "in this letter we have considered self - interacting scalar field theory in the universe with holonomy effects resulting from the loop quantum cosmology .",
    "we have performed constraint for the scalar field in the form @xmath0 where @xmath2const .",
    "based on this restriction we have derived expression for the scalar field potential which fulfills this condition . this condition can be fulfilled for @xmath115 $ ] .",
    "the case @xmath55 is excluded .",
    "such a state can be obtained only in the case @xmath46 and can not be mimicked with @xmath116 .",
    "we have solved considered model analytically .",
    "subsequently , we have performed analogous investigations for the phantom field @xmath117 .",
    "potentials for scalar and phantom fields are related by the symmetry @xmath118 .",
    "we have shown how barotropic matter can be introduced in lqc in the well - defined manner . in this approach matter",
    "content is mimicked by the scalar field with derived potential ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "we have shown that field @xmath19 is monotonic function of time in both considered cases .",
    "this result indicates that scalar field ( as well as phantom field ) with derived potentials can be moreover treated as intrinsic time .",
    "the models therefore seems to be good candidate to the further purely quantum considerations .",
    "we have performed preliminary studies of the perturbations of the scalar field with obtained multi - fluid potential . in the pre - bounce phase",
    "super - horizontal modes are typically damped .",
    "namely the power spectrum is @xmath100 .",
    "however to verify that this spectrum survives during the bounce phase further numerical analysis should be performed .",
    "if super - horizontal spectrum does not change qualitatively this can lead to the suppression of the low cmb multipoles .",
    "we have also indicated that non - gaussian perturbations are produced .",
    "further analysis of this issue may provide observational bounds on the model .",
    "therefore beside the purely theoretical results as the method of introducing barotropic mater in lqc also phenomenological consequences were found .",

    "in this appendix we are going to verify obtained solutions ( [ solpt],[solphit ] ) solving from scratch equations of motion ( [ friedmann],[fieldequation ] ) with potential ( [ potential ] ) . without loose of generality",
