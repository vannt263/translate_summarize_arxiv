    "the phenomenon of zitterbewegung ( zb , trembling motion ) was devised by schrodinger in 1930  @xcite .",
    "schrodinger observed that , in the  @xmath0 dirac hamiltonian for relativistic electron in a vacuum , the velocity operator  @xmath1 does not commute with the hamiltonian , so that , even in the absence of external fields , the electron velocity is not a constant of the motion .",
    "schrodinger calculated velocity and position operators as functions of time and showed that they contain , in addition to the expected classical terms , also quickly oscillating terms , which he called zitterbewegung .",
    "this quantum result is quite unexpected , as it goes beyond the newton first law of motion . since schrodinger s pioneering work",
    "the phenomenon of zb has become a subject of numerous theoretical papers and some controversies .",
    "it has been recognized that , mathematically speaking , zb is a result of interference between the positive- and negative - energy states of the dirac hamiltonian , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "lock  @xcite in his important paper showed that , if one represents the electron as a wave packet then , as a result of the riemann - lesbegues lemma , the zb oscillations decay in time .",
    "the use of wave packets satisfies the well - known requirement of the quantum theory stating that an operator alone does not represent physical reality .",
    "the latter is given by an average value of the operator taken over a quantum state .",
    "this difficulty is present in the original treatment of schrodinger s , who obtained his results in terms of operators .",
    "beginning from 1970 the zitterbewegung was proposed also for electrons in solids where the velocities are not relativistic  @xcite .",
    "the decisive feature is that the electron energy spectrum consists of at least two bands , so that the interference of upper and lower energy states can take place .",
    "a real surge of works dealing with zb in solids and other periodic systems began in 2005 , when the papers by zawadzki  @xcite and schliemann _ et al . _",
    "@xcite dealing with semiconductors appeared . as we already mentioned , representing an electron by a wave packet makes theoretical treatment much more physical , although it introduces a decay of zb oscillations which depends on packet s width",
    "however , there exists another important parameter defining the initial conditions .",
    "since the zb phenomenon is a result of interference between upper and lower energy states , the initial state must also be defined by upper and lower initial components . in handbooks on relativistic quantum mechanics",
    "@xcite four - component packets are usually assumed without specifying their values . for semiconductors ,",
    "commonly assumed packets have the gaussian shape with one non - vanishing component  @xcite @xmath2.\\ ] ] for this choice , as we show in appendix  a , one always needs an initial momentum  @xmath3 in one direction to have zb oscillations in the perpendicular direction . on the other hand , as shown by gerritsma _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their proof - of - principle simulation of the one - dimensional dirac equation with the use of trapped ions interacting with laser beams , a gaussian wave packet was created with two non - vanishing components and the observed zitterbewegung had the same direction as the initial momentum .",
    "a review of zb in various periodic systems was given by the present authors in  @xcite .",
    "it follows from the above description that the choice of initial wave packet , i.e. its shape , initial momentum and components , is decisive for the resulting properties of zb . as to the common choice of packets indicated in  ( [ intr_gauss ] ) , which requires the initial value of  @xmath3 , it is not clear how to create this momentum .",
    "if one uses light to create the electron packet , the initial wave vector  @xmath4 will be small since photons do not carry much momentum .",
    "if one uses acoustic phonons to trigger the zb motion , the initial energy will be small .",
    "one could use simultaneously energy and momentum conservation laws in photon excitations between bands , but then one would deal with packets depending on the modulus  @xmath5 , i.e. with a circle ( or sphere ) of momenta in different directions around the zero value .",
    "also , a narrow light pulse creates a relatively large energy uncertainty which results in a wide spread of initial momenta .    in view of the above difficulties and also to make the project more realistic experimentally , we propose here not to assume anything _ a piori _ about the electron wave packet , but to determine it as a result of a realistic laser pulse",
    ". then we propose to use it for a calculation of zb oscillations . a preliminary effort to determine and then use the electron wave packet created by a light pulse",
    "was carried out in a perturbative way in  @xcite .",
    "we consider carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) as a suitable electronic system , see  @xcite .",
    "we also tried to apply our procedure to monolayer graphene , but it turned out that graphene is not particulary suitable for our purpose .",
    "this aspect is discussed in appendix  b.    the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we outline the theory of packet creation and zb oscillations in carbon nanotubes with the use of an ultra - shot laser pulse . in section  3",
    "we present the results of calculations , in section  4 we discuss the obtained results .",
    "the paper is concluded by a summary . in appendices",
    "we discuss an influence of packet components on zb in general , the zb motion in graphene for the electron wave packet created by a laser pulse , and the validity of an approximate form of the vector potential .",

    "see appendix  c.    in order to introduce the vector potential into the tight - binding hamiltonian  ( [ ml_hh ] ) we employ the method proposed by graf and vogl  @xcite . following this approach we replace in  ( [ ml_hab1 ] ) each  @xmath16 by its potential - dependent counterpart  @xmath64 @xmath65\\right\\}.\\ ] ] we do not modify the in - site energies  @xmath66 because the scalar potential is zero . since  @xmath67 in  ( [ pulse_at ] ) does not depend on  @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 and one obtains @xmath70 where  @xmath71 is the generalized quasi - momentum .",
    "the final result of the above approximations resembles the usual `` minimal coupling '' substitution for the free - electron case in the presence of an electric field .",
    "thus , as a result of illumination by light , we deal with the time - dependent electron hamiltonian for our problem .",

    "figure  2(a ) shows the probability distribution  @xmath110 at  @xmath111  fs , for which the laser pulse terminates and the packet oscillates according to the field - free hamiltonian given in  ( [ ml_hh ] ) and  ( [ cnt_hab2 ] ) .",
    "the packet created by the laser pulse consists mainly of negative - energy states . since there is :  @xmath112 , the several minima of  @xmath110 give rise to the positive - energy component of the packet .",
    "the contribution of these states does not exceed a few percent of the probability density .",
    "for  @xmath113 the probability of finding the electron in the negative - energy state is zero ( not shown in the figure ) , since the nanotube of  @xmath43 includes one pair of bands ( with  @xmath114 ) having the vanishing energy gap .    in figure  2(b ) we show the calculated probability densities  @xmath115 for four pairs of bands listed in table  1 .",
    "for all pairs of bands , except the pair with  @xmath114 , the probability densities of negative energy states exceed 70% and for each pair of bands they form a few bell - like minima .",
    "it is seen that , for the pair of bands with  @xmath116 ( i.e. those having the lowest non - vanishing energy gap ) , the probability density  @xmath110  has a bell - like minimum near  @xmath113 , which does not occur for other pairs of bands . as mentioned above",
    ", the bell - like minimum of the negative - energy states corresponds to the analogous maximum of the positive - energy states .",

    "both the electron velocity and electric field are zero .",
    "then , within the first  @xmath118  fs , the amplitude if electron velocity grows and decreases similarly but not identically to the field amplitude .",
    "after  @xmath119  fs the electric field of the pulse disappears , but there persist oscillations slowly decaying in time .",
    "these oscillations resemble the zb oscillations in cnt described in  @xcite and they have a similar character , slowly decaying as  @xmath120 with  @xmath121 . in figure  3(b ) we show the calculated time - dependent probability of negative - energy component of the packet , see  ( [ cnt_pm ] ) .",
    "initially , for  @xmath82 , the electron occupies only the valence states and there is  @xmath122 . for  @xmath123 , after the pulse disappears , the final electron state has a nonzero admixture of states with positive energies which is a necessary condition for the appearance of zb oscillations  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the fourier transform of  @xmath89 and the power spectrum  @xmath124 for  @xmath125 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  4 by the solid line .",
    "the intensity has the maximum for  @xmath126  fs@xmath127 , which is close to the interband frequency  @xmath128  fs@xmath127 between the pair of bands corresponding to  @xmath116 , see figure  1 .",
    "this means that the average packet velocity oscillates mostly with the interband frequency  @xmath129 .",
    "the dashed line shows power spectrum of the laser pulse given in  ( [ pulse_et ] ) centered around  @xmath130  fs@xmath127 and having the width  @xmath131  fs@xmath127 , which corresponds to pulse duration  @xmath132  fs . since the zb frequency  @xmath129 occurs within the pulse spectrum , it is possible to excite zb oscillations .",
    "the results presented in figures  3 and  4 confirm the possibility of experimental creation of the wave packet which , for  @xmath133  fs , ( i.e. after the pulse termination ) oscillates with the interband zb frequency  @xmath134  fs@xmath127 .    , calculated for  @xmath125 , versus frequency .",

    "although the packet oscillations have the zb frequency both for  @xmath136  fs and  @xmath138  fs , we interpret only the motion at  @xmath138  fs , in the absence of the laser pulse , as an unmistakable manifestation of the zb phenomenon .",

    "figure  5 shows separate velocities  @xmath141 resulting from the interference between three pairs of energy bands , respectively . for  @xmath125",
    "the oscillations disappear for all pairs of bands except those for  @xmath116 .",
    "the latter have the interband zb frequency  @xmath128  fs@xmath127 .",
    "this means that , for  @xmath125 , the zb oscillations shown in figure  3(a ) are caused by the interference of states in upper and lower  @xmath116 bands .",
    "they are similar to those found within the  @xmath142 theory in  @xcite . in figure  6",
    "we show the calculated average velocity  @xmath141 for the central laser frequency  @xmath54 close to the interband frequency  @xmath143  fs@xmath127 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the pair of bands with  @xmath144 . in this case , for  @xmath125 the zb oscillations for the pair of bands with  @xmath116 quickly vanish , but the oscillations for the bands with  @xmath144 resemble those in figure  5(a ) , which means that the zb motion results from the  @xmath144 bands .",
    "results shown in figures  5 and  6 indicate that zb oscillations are caused by pairs of bands separated by the gap close to the energy of laser light .",
    "this means that , in principle if the gap between bands falls within the range of power spectrum of the laser pulse , these bands can contribute to zb motion .",
    "this , however , should not be understood as single - photon resonances .",
    "the calculations shown in figures  5(c ) and  6(c ) strongly suggest that the pair of linear bands with  @xmath114 , for which the energy gap vanishes , _ does not _ contribute to the zb motion after the termination of the laser pulse .",

    "@xmath53 we calculated the power spectrum of the fourier transform of packet velocity  @xmath148 as functions of laser frequency  @xmath54 .",
    "for each combination of  @xmath54 and  @xmath53 we calculated the packet velocity  @xmath149 , found the appropriate cut - off time  @xmath150 and calculated the fourier transform of  @xmath149 for  @xmath125 and its modulus squared .",
    "in figure  7 we plot our results for the pairs of bands with  @xmath144 ,  @xmath116 , and  @xmath151 .",
    "we identify two qualitatively different regimes of the velocity oscillations .",
    "the first regime occurs for  @xmath152  fs@xmath127 , where the electron motion consists of one or two interband frequencies close to  @xmath54 .",
    "the second regime occurs for  @xmath153  fs@xmath127 , i.e. for the frequencies below the energy gap for bands with  @xmath116 . in this regime",
    "the photon energy is _ smaller _ that the lowest non - vanishing energy gap in cnt , but the large amplitude of the electric field excites some electrons from the valence to the conduction bands .",
    "this statement should be understood qualitatively .",
    "the excitement in this regime has no one - one correspondence to the resonant frequencies . as a result ,",
    "in the second regime it is possible to obtain the zb oscillations with _ a few _ interband frequencies for sufficiently large electric field intensities . in our opinion",
    "the zb motion can be observed more readily in the first regime of  @xmath54 .    in more general terms , one can ask the question whether the wave packet created in real space by the laser pulse is sufficiently localized , so that one can talk about its trembling motion .",
    "we calculated its variance :  @xmath154 and it turns out that it behaves like that of an equivalent gaussian packet slowly spreading in time .",
    "this means that one can legitimately consider the trembling motion of such a packet .",
    "it is more convenient to measure experimentally the effect of zb when there is only one zb frequency .",
    "an existence of two or more frequencies , as indicated in figure  7 , may be inconvenient since then one must calculate the fourier transforms of observed oscillations . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on packet s velocity rather than position , because the velocity is more closely related to observable quantities , like radiation or current .",
    "an average position can be obtained from the velocity by the time integral :  @xmath155 .",
    "it should be mentioned that we analyzed previously the zb motion in cnt using the  @xmath156 method assuming the gaussian shapes of electron wave packets as given in  ( [ intr_gauss ] ) , see  @xcite . in this case , averaging over the packet presents no difficulties because the gaussian function automatically limits the range of integration .",
    "the use of  @xmath156 method for the packets created by laser pulses , which are not strongly concentrated in the  @xmath157 space , see figure  2 , creates problems of averaging because the final results depend on the range of integration . for this reason we used in this paper the tight - binding method , so that the integration is automatically limited to the first brillouin zone .",
    "the second important reason for using the tight - binding calculations for cnt is that they give a few realistic energy bands which play different roles for various laser frequencies  @xmath54 .",
    "the tight - binding model for cnt , as considered in this paper , includes only the interactions between valence  @xmath158 orbitals of the nearest - neighbour atoms , while other orbitals , i.e.  @xmath159 ,  @xmath160 and  @xmath161 , are neglected .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , more advanced models for cnt give similar energy band structures to that employed here .",
    "we consider zigzag cnts with the chiral vector  @xmath162 .",
    "such cnts were widely analyzed in the literature , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to consider other possible cnts having , for example , other chiral vectors  @xmath28 .",
    "taking  @xmath163 allows one to observe zb with the interband frequency  @xmath164  fs@xmath127 , which can be excited by a red laser , as discussed in  @xcite , or with the ti : sapphire laser .",
    "however , the obtained zb oscillations in this case are much weaker than those shown in figure  3 .",
    "we also calculated the electron motion for wider nanotubes :  @xmath165 ,  @xmath166 and  @xmath167 . by increasing  @xmath168 ,",
    "it is possible to reduce the gap between positive and negative energy bands even to 0.32  fs@xmath127 , i.e. to the far - infrared region .",
    "however , illumination of such nanotubes by short laser pulses causes excitations of electrons in many bands , so the resulting electron motion consists of many interband frequencies . for",
    "@xmath167 the packet motion for  @xmath125 resembles chaotic noise and it is only after calculating the fourier transforms that one can identify various interband components .",
    "therefore , it seems impractical to observe the zb motion in wider cnts .",
    "in addition to the zigzag nanotubes described by the chiral vector  @xmath30 there exist two other types of nanotubes : armchair cnts , characterized by a chiral vector  @xmath169 , and chiral cnts having a chiral vector  @xmath170 with integer  @xmath171 . in the present paper we chose the zigzag cnt because in this case the energy gaps are located at the  @xmath172 point of the brillouin zone ( at  @xmath113 ) , while for armchair or chiral cnts the energy gaps occur in low - symmetry points of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "this feature complicates analysis of zb , but the zb oscillations should also exist in armchair or chiral nanotubes .",
    "in our model we consider completely occupied valence bands and completely empty conduction bands which assumes that the system is at low temperatures .",
    "this approach can be justified by the results presented in figures  5 and  6 , showing that the zb oscillations are caused by the pair of  @xmath116 energy bands separated by the wide energy gap  @xmath173  ev . since the linear energy bands with  @xmath114 do not contribute to the zb motion",
    ", one may safely neglect the impact of nonzero temperatures .",
    "we disregard both the many - body and scattering effects .",
    "this is an approximation , since the scattering as well as radiative recombination processes will cause a decay of the non - stationary states .",
    "after the excitation , packet s energy may be larger than the energy of initial state .",
    "this excess energy will be radiated through recombination processes which may be different from the radiation related to oscillating electron dipoles due to the zb motion .",
    "as pointed out before  @xcite , the oscillating electron packet emits dipole radiation proportional to the average packet s acceleration .",
    "the dipole radiation has the same frequencies as  @xmath149 , so its measurement may confirm the existence of packet motion with the zb frequencies .",
    "excitation of zb oscillations requires sufficiently short laser pulses properly tuned to the interband frequency .",
    "it has been recently possible to produce laser pulses with the relative carrier - to - envelope phase  ( cep )  @xcite . for such pulses",
    "the electric field has the form :  @xmath174 , where  @xmath175 is the gaussian envelope and  @xmath176 is the carrier - to envelope - phase .",
    "the results shown in section  3 correspond to  @xmath177 , see  ( [ pulse_et ] ) .",
    "we also performed calculations for  @xmath178 and the results are qualitatively similar to those presented above .",
    "we concentrate on experimentally available pulses having the intensity  @xmath179  v / m  @xcite .",
    "we also performed calculations for  @xmath52 changing from  @xmath180  v / m to  @xmath181  v / m , and other parameters listed in table  1 . for low fields :  @xmath182  v / m , the electron motion is weakly perturbed by pulse s field and the resulting amplitude of zb motion is small . for larger fields , close to  @xmath183  v / m , we obtain clear zb oscillations whose amplitude depends on field intensity . the optimum field for packet creation",
    "is  @xmath184  v / m , see figures  6 and  7 , and for such a field the excited packet consists of 95% of states with negative energies and 5% of states with positive energies . for still larger fields ,  @xmath185  v / m",
    ", the results become ambiguous since a strong electric field excites electrons from many bands in a way similar to that discussed in figure  7 .    as to the gauge aspects ,",
    "it is convenient to use the vector gauge since then the schrodinger equation  ( [ cnt_hht ] ) represents a set of ordinary differential equations for  @xmath83 . in the scalar gauge",
    ":  @xmath186 ,  @xmath187 , the corresponding schrodinger equation presents a set of partial differential equations in time and position variables , which is more difficult to solve .",
    "if we treated our problem using the @xmath117 formalism , the interband matrix elements of momentum , necessary to determine the band structure , appear also in the interband optical transitions .",
    "they would then be responsible for the resulting electron wave packet created by the laser pulse .",
    "however , in the tight - binding formalism , when we calculate the electron packet solving exactly the equations of motion by numerical procedure , the resulting packet is calculated without approximations and it is probably quite realistic .    the average packet velocity calculated in figures  3 ,  5 and  6 are closely related to the interband polarization induced by the laser pulse :  @xmath188 . in fact , the zb oscillations are proportional to the time - derivative of interband polarization .",
    "an advanced method to calculate the latter quantity in cnt is the so - called cnt bloch equations ( cbe )  @xcite , which are modification of semiconductor bloch equations  @xcite for carbon nanotubes .",
    "thus one can also use cbe to calculate the zb oscillations .",
    "the formalism of cbe allows one to take into account decoherence and relaxation processes . in a recent paper we took into account the above features in the description of zb using the density matrix formalism  @xcite",
    "it turned out that the decoherence causes an exponential decay of zb oscillations governed by the decoherence time  @xmath189 .",
    "the experimental time  @xmath189 was estimated to be  @xmath190  fs  @xcite , which is much larger than the scale of zb oscillations in figures  3 ,  5 and  6 , so that the dephasing processes do not modify qualitatively our results .",
    "the approach used here corresponds to the free - particle version of cbe and it does not take into account excitonic effects as well as the renormalization of the band energies by the many - electron interactions  @xcite . as follows from our analysis ,",
    "the zb oscillations depend on the energy gap between the pair of interfering bands , so that they will be somewhat affected by the excitonic effects and gap renormalization , but we do not expect any major modifications of our description caused by these effects .",
    "we mention that , in order to introduce the sbe one often uses the so - called rotating wave approximation ( rwa )  @xcite . in our paper",
    "we do not use this approximation since our results are obtained numerically .",
    "however , in the regimes shown in figures  3 ,  5 and  6 the rwa would be justified since the differences between the central laser frequency and zb frequency are around  10%-20% .",
    "now we briefly mention numerical aspects of our calculations .",
    "the results presented in figures  3   6 are obtained for a grid of  @xmath90 points with  @xmath92 and for  @xmath191 energy bands , which means that  ( [ cnt_hht ] ) is solved  7,218 times .",
    "we treat  @xmath192 as an accuracy - control parameter and the reported value of  @xmath192 ensures the proper accuracy of  @xmath38 integration [ see  ( [ cnt_vx ] ) ] .",
    "the results in figure  7 require calculations of zb for  90 values of  @xmath54 and for three values of  @xmath53 , so that  ( [ cnt_hht ] ) has to be solved  1,948,860 times .",
    "the norm of the wave function  @xmath83 serves as a control - parameter of the numerical solution of  ( [ cnt_hht ] ) .",
    "we adjusted the time - step and other program parameters to ensure the norm of the wave function with the relative error below  @xmath193 for all instants of time .",
    "the basic question arises : are the one - component shifted gaussian wave packets , as used in the literature and indicated in  ( [ intr_gauss ] ) , adequate to describe the phenomenon of electron zitterbewegung in solids ? on the one hand , they correctly give zb oscillations with the interband frequency and , for example , the zb motion for  @xmath125 calculated for a realistic wave packet , as shown in figure  3(a ) , is similar to that calculated with the use of gaussian packets , see figure  3 of  @xcite .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication that zb is a robust and basic phenomenon , not very sensitive to the details of the employed model . however , there are two important objections to using the shifted gaussian packets .",
    "the first is , that such packets are almost impossible to create , mostly due to their large built - in initial momentum .",
    "the second objection is that sometimes such packets are `` too good to be true '' , resulting for example in very nice zb oscillations in graphene , see e.g. figure  2 in  @xcite , while the realistic wave packet created by the laser pulse gives almost no zb effect , see our figure  8 .",
    "we conclude that one must be very cautious when using convenient but not realistic shifted gaussian packets for the description of zitterbewegung .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that a calculation similar to ours can be done for electrons in superlattices with finite energy gaps between 2d subbands .",
    "technically , such a calculation is somewhat more complicated than that for the 1d motion in cnt since one should in addition integrate over the 2d electron wave vectors .",
    "we describe the phenomenon of electron zitterbewegung with the use of non - stationary electron wave packets created by laser pulses in zigzag carbon nanotubes .",
    "the band structure of cnt is calculated with the use of a tight - binding approximation generalized for the presence of radiation .",
    "the laser light must be roughly tuned to the energy gap between proper pairs of energy bands in cnt .",
    "it is shown that , after the laser pulse terminates , the electron experiences zb oscillations with the interband frequency .",
    "the pair of linear energy bands , separated by the vanishing energy gap , does not contribute to the zb effect .",
    "the influence of initial packet components on the resulting zb motion is analyzed and it is shown that electron wave packets commonly used in the theoretical literature are convenient for calculations but not realistic .",
    "here we briefly analyze , as a matter of example , the motion of an electron in monolayer graphene prepared in the form of a packet with two nonzero components @xmath194 where  @xmath195 and  @xmath196 are two real functions of  @xmath157 normalized to :  @xmath197 . in the",
    "@xmath156 approach the hamiltonian for electron at the  @xmath198 point of the brillouin zone is  @xcite @xmath199 where  @xmath200 m / s .",

    "the first two integrals in  ( [ appla_vx_ab ] ) vanish and the remaining integral is an odd function of  @xmath27 .",
    "this integral vanishes for  @xmath208 being an even function in  @xmath27 , but is nonzero for  @xmath208 having a non - vanishing odd part .",

    "however , for  @xmath213 there is  @xmath214 , so that the last integral in  ( [ appla_vx_ab ] ) remains finite and it leads to decaying zb oscillations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for one - component gaussian packets , the nonzero value of  @xmath215 is a necessary condition of the zb motion in the  @xmath49 direction .",
    "this was concluded in many papers .",
    "let us now consider packets with two nonzero components . for simplicity",
    "we take  @xmath216 , with  @xmath195 given in  ( [ appa_ak ] ) , and set  @xmath211 .",
    "then the last integral in  ( [ appla_vx_ab ] ) vanishes identically , but the first two integrals remain finite because they are even functions of  @xmath29 and  @xmath27 .",
    "then the first integral describes zb oscillations , while the second gives a rectilinear motion .",
    "this simple example shows that various choices of packet components lead to qualitatively different results for the average velocity .    as to the wave packet created by a laser shot ,",
    "see ( [ cnt_hht ] ) , numerical calculations show that after pulse termination the packet consists of  @xmath217 of states having positive energies and  @xmath218 of states having negative energies .",
    "this packet has two non - zero components @xmath219 where  @xmath220 and  @xmath221 are oscillating functions of  @xmath38 . since the created wave packet has two non - vanishing components and it consists of states having both positive and negative energies one can expect existence of the zb oscillations .",
    "this is indeed the case , as shown above .",
    "for  @xmath222 for the packet created by laser pulse ; ( c ) probability density  @xmath223 for  @xmath82 for the gaussian packet given in equation  ( [ intr_gauss ] ) and with parameters used in  @xcite .",

    ", width=302,height=302 ]    the results shown in figures  5(c ) and  6(c ) for cnt indicate that the linear energy bands with  @xmath114 and  @xmath42 do not contribute to the zb motion after the termination of laser pulse .",
    "this suggests that the zb oscillations may quickly disappear also in monolayer graphene , in which the linear bands are most important . to verify this conjecture",
    "we calculate the electron motion in graphene after an illumination by the laser pulse . introducing the vector potential into the hamiltonian  ( [ ml_hh ] ) in the way described in sec .",
    "2 we obtain the following schrodinger equation , see  ( [ ml_hh ] ) ,  ( [ ml_hab2 ] ) and  ( [ cnt_h0 ] ) @xmath224 where @xmath225 in which  @xmath226 . then the average packet velocity is , see  ( [ cnt_vxkxmy ] ) and  ( [ cnt_vx ] ) @xmath227 the integration is performed over the two - dimensional brillouin zone ( bz ) , which is a hexagon having vertices at the  @xmath198 and  @xmath228 points :  @xmath229 and  @xmath230 .",
    "the average electron velocity in the  @xmath231 direction is obtained by analogy .",
    "we solve numerically the schrodinger equation  ( [ appb_hht ] ) for  @xmath232 values of  @xmath29 and  @xmath27 , respectively , taking  @xmath233 .",
    "the initial condition for the wave function is :  @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the negative energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian  ( [ ml_hh ] ) .",
    "the results of calculations for the material and pulse parameters listed in table  1 are shown in figure  8(a ) .",
    "the solid line indicates  @xmath236 obtained from  ( [ appb_ml_vx ] ) , the dashed line is the laser electric field in arbitrary units .",
    "average packet velocity in the  @xmath231 direction is zero .",
    "as before ,  @xmath237  fs indicates the time for which the pulse vanishes .",
    "it is seen in figure  8(a ) that the velocity oscillations disappear quickly after the pulse termination .",
    "this result confirms our expectation that the laser pulse allows one to excite the zb oscillations in nanotubes , but it can hardly create the zb motion in graphene .",
    "next we calculate the fourier transform of  @xmath236 and find that the spectrum  @xmath238 contains the laser frequency  @xmath130  s@xmath127 plus two satellites at  @xmath239  s@xmath127 and  @xmath240  s@xmath127 .",
    "this means that the electron oscillates with the laser frequency and not with the interband frequency .",
    "this is in contrast to nanotubes in which the electron , even during the pulse , oscillates with  @xmath129 corresponding to the interband energy between some pair of energy bands . to confirm this conclusion we calculate the average packet velocity and its fourier transform for the pulse created by a ti : sapphire laser :  @xmath241  s@xmath127 and  @xmath242  fs . in this case",
    "the electron motion also disappears quickly after the pulse termination and its fourier spectrum contains the frequency  @xmath243 plus one satellite .",
    "these results confirm that it is practically impossible to excite the zb oscillations in monolayer graphene by a laser pulse .",
    "the above conclusion seems to be inconsistent with our previous results obtained in  @xcite , in which the zb oscillations in monolayer graphene were calculated for gaussian packets .",
    "this apparent contradiction is caused by the difference between electron wave packets used in the two cases . to show this difference we again calculate probability densities of states having negative energies for both packets , in a way analogous to that described in section  2 , see  ( [ cnt_a1a2 ] ) and the last paragraph of section  2 . in figure  8(b ) we plot the probability density  @xmath244 at  @xmath222 for the wave packet created by laser pulse .",

    "the packet shown in figure  8(b ) is delocalized in the  @xmath157 space and it consists of wave vectors within the whole bz .",
    "it is seen that there are contributions to  @xmath244 arising from the six vertices of the hexagonal bz of graphene and from other areas of the bz , e.g. from its center .",
    "the probability distribution does not possess the sixfold symmetry because the laser light is assumed to be polarized in the  @xmath49 direction .",
    "on the other hand , in figure  8(c ) we plot the probability density  @xmath223 for the gaussian packet given in  ( [ intr_gauss ] ) , taking  @xmath246 ,  @xmath247 m@xmath127 and  @xmath248   , see  @xcite . in our previous approach the hamiltonian  ( [ ml_hh ] ) was expanded in the frame of  @xmath117 theory in the vicinity of the  @xmath198 point of bz .",
    "the arrow indicates position of one the  @xmath198 points in bz .",
    "note the big difference in scales in figure  8(b ) and figure  8(c ) .",
    "in contrast to the distribution shown in figure  8(b ) , the gaussian packet in figure  8(c ) is concentrated in a small fraction of bz .",
    "for this reason , one may expect very different behavior of zb oscillations for both packets , which is indeed the case , see figure  8(a ) and  @xcite .",
