    "one of the more profound features of supersymmetric field theories is that solitonic field configurations are often endowed with a special status , namely they are annihilated by a certain number of supercharges and thus lie in shortened , or bps , representations @xcite .",
    "this feature has far - reaching consequences due to the ensuing non - renormalization theorems which affect the mass ( or tension ) and spectrum of these solitons , some of which may play an important role in the dynamics . in general ,",
    "soliton configurations exhibit a moduli space of solutions , and much insight can be gleaned from a study of the low energy collective coordinate dynamics on this space and its induced metric @xcite .",
    "this is particularly true in cases where the moduli space is nontrivial in the sense that it includes components beyond that associated with the broken translation generators ; the latter component is always present on the grounds that a soliton is a localized configuration .    in the supersymmetric context",
    ", the moduli space @xmath2 _ locally _ admits the general decomposition , _",
    "susy  , where @xmath3 refers to the sector associated with bosonic generators in the supersymmetry ( susy ) algebra which are broken by the soliton , and in flat space always includes a translational component @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the codimension .",
    "the realization of supersymmetry in this sector , associated with the unbroken generators , is then fixed by the kinematics of the bulk superalgebra .",
    "in contrast , @xmath6  the ` reduced moduli space '  is not directly associated with broken generators in the superalgebra .",
    "this has the important consequence that in certain cases the realization of worldvolume supersymmetry is less constrained by the bulk kinematics .",
    "in particular , we will argue here that there are situations in which the number of supercharges which act trivially on the reduced moduli space of a bps soliton can be _ larger _ than one would infer directly from the preserved fraction of bulk supersymmetry .",
    "the origin of this supersymmetry enhancement is that not all of the supercharges which are realized on the worldvolume of the soliton lift to supercharges in the full theory .",
    "the additional _ supernumerary _ supercharges arise due to special geometric features of the reduced moduli space , e.g. a khler or hyperkhler structure , which are not present within the full theory .",
    "the primary aim of this paper is to illustrate how this novel feature plays an important role in the dynamics of 1/2-bps domain walls in sqcd .",
    "in particular , we will focus on the theory with gauge group su(@xmath7 ) accompanied by @xmath1 fundamental flavors with masses which are small relative to the dynamical scale , @xmath8 , of the theory .",
    "this theory has a low energy description on the higgs branch , in terms of meson and baryon chiral superfield moduli , where it reduces to a massive perturbation of a khler sigma model on the manifold determined by the quantum constraint @xcite , m - b = _",
    "the massive theory possesses @xmath7 quantum vacua which , with a hierarchical structure for the quark mass matrix , are in the weak coupling regime . on decoupling @xmath7 flavors ,",
    "these @xmath7 vacua tend smoothly to the @xmath7 quantum vacua of pure sym @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 distinct vacua of this theory allow for domain wall solutions which interpolate between them .",
    "the corresponding central charge is present in the superalgebra @xcite and such solitons are 1/2-bps saturated . in previous work @xcite",
    ", we studied the bps wall spectrum in this theory , following earlier work on bps walls in other variants of sqcd @xcite .",
    "the vacuum structure is illustrated in the plane of the superpotential in fig .  1 , which also provides a graphical definition of a @xmath9-wall , namely a bps wall which interpolates between vacua differing in phase by @xmath10 .",
    "in @xcite we argued , as reviewed below , that @xmath9-walls exhibit a nontrivial classical reduced moduli space @xmath11 due to localized goldstone modes associated with the flavor symmetries which are broken by the wall solution .",
    "the corresponding coset is a complex grassmannian @xcite , _ k = g(k , n )  .",
    "one can then formally deduce that the multiplicity of @xmath9-walls , @xmath12 , is given by the worldvolume witten index for this grassmannian sigma model , which depends only on the topology of the space , and is given by the euler characteristic , _ k  =   ( g(k , n ) )  =   .",
    "[ degen1 ] this was the primary result of @xcite , which interestingly was consistent with an alternative string - theoretic picture of bps walls in pure sym @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we wish to study the worldvolume dynamics in more detail , and resolve some of the puzzles which arise from a closer inspection of the above result .",
    "one of these is the statement that the reduced moduli space is a khler manifold .",
    "since the worldvolume theory lives in 2 + 1d , the dual constraints of ( i ) a khler target space , and ( ii ) lorentz invariance , imply that the low energy dynamics must preserve supersymmetry , namely four supercharges !",
    "since only two bulk supercharges act trivially on the soliton solution , this conclusion clearly requires some justification .",
    "a seemingly related paradox was in fact noted some time ago in considering the khler moduli space of lumps in khler sigma models @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case , the problem dissipates once one realizes that lorentz invariance places no constraint and one can consistently realize just two supercharges in terms of one - component fermions @xcite .",
    "the situation here allows for no such resolution and , as alluded to above , in this case there is indeed an enhancement of supersymmetry , at least at the two - derivative level .",
    "this enhancement does not of course apply to the ( decoupled ) translational sector , but only to the reduced moduli space .",
    "we will provide an explicit example of how this can occur , and then apply it to @xmath9-walls in sqcd and more specifically to the simplest case of 1-walls in the case of an su(2 ) gauge group .",
    "we note that the mechanism appears likely to apply more widely for other solitons in theories .",
    "a second issue that we aim to resolve is to understand what happens to the flavor moduli coordinatizing @xmath11 when we explicitly break some of the flavor symmetries by putting the quark mass matrix in a hierarchical form .",
    "in such a maximally asymmetric regime , the wall no longer breaks any additional global symmetries and one anticipates that the moduli space should be lifted .",
    "we will provide evidence that this is indeed the case .",
    "in particular , by considering the realization of the worldvolume supercharges for the su(2 ) @xmath13 theory , we show that , for a linear order perturbation in the mass matrix , the effect is to introduce a potential on the moduli space which geometrically is the norm squared of a u(1 ) killing vector .",
    "such a ` real mass ' deformation in 2 + 1d is known to be consistent with susy @xcite . moreover , one important consistency check is that the result one obtains via this linear deformation is in fact perfectly compatible with the opposite limit in which the second flavor is integrated out .",
    "the third and final aim of this work is to explore the realization of other bulk solitons within the worldvolume theory of domain walls . the example we focus on corresponds to a novel class of two - wall 1/4-bps junctions which are possible by virtue of the degeneracy ( [ degen1 ] ) of bps walls interpolating between the same two vacua .",
    "we will provide evidence that these configurations can be identified with 1/2-bps kinks in the worldvolume grassmannian sigma model .",
    "these configurations thus preserve two worldvolume supercharges only one of which can be identified with the unbroken bulk supercharge . as evidence for this identification",
    ", we will verify for the su(2 ) case that there is a direct match for the tension between the bulk result obtained in the hierarchical mass regime , and the appropriate limit of the kink tension for the massive sigma model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we consider the moduli space of bps solitons , and discuss in some generality the worldvolume realization of supersymmetry .",
    "we argue that the reduced moduli space may in certain cases exhibit supersymmetry enhancement and present a simple sigma model where this arises for the worldline dynamics of bps kinks .",
    "we then turn to the specific case of bps walls in @xmath1 flavor sqcd in sect .  3 , recalling the structure of the wall moduli space @xcite and then describing the worldvolume realization of supersymmetry , which on the reduced moduli space is enhanced to .",
    "we describe the structure explicitly for the su(2 ) case with unequal quark masses , as is required to remain at weak coupling .",
    "this viewpoint is applied in sect .  4 to consider novel 1/4-bps two - wall junctions from the viewpoint of the wall worldvolume .",
    "we finish with some concluding remarks on other worldvolume solitons , including lumps , in sect .  5 .",
    "in an appendix , we review the structure of tensorial central charges in @xmath14 and 4 , noting a subtlety with vectorial string charges .",
    "in this section we will discuss some aspects of the matching between bosonic and fermionic moduli for bps solitons .",
    "we distinguish the translational sector , which is essentially fixed on kinematic grounds , from the remainder of the moduli  the reduced moduli space  which we argue , by way of an explicit example , can in certain situations exhibit an ` enhancement ' of supersymmetry , in the sense that the associated dynamics preserves more supercharges than one would infer from the bulk superalgebra .",
    "the additional supercharges act only on the reduced moduli space and are not present in the bulk theory .",
    "we begin with a simple physical perspective on the matching between bosonic and fermionic moduli of bps solitons .",
    "recall that on general grounds the bosonic moduli space for a configuration of solitons in flat space locally admits the decomposition _",
    "susy  , [ decomp ] where @xmath3 is the sector associated with broken ( bosonic ) symmetry generators in the superalgebra .",
    "the second factor in ( [ decomp ] ) , @xmath6 , encodes any other modes associated with broken global symmetries , e.g. relative translations or , as will be more relevant here , flavor symmetries .",
    "consider a bosonic soliton configuration @xmath15 in @xmath16-dimensional minkowski space which has finite mass ( or tension )  large relative to the scales of the underlying theory  and is localised in @xmath17 spatial dimensions . within a lorentz invariant field theory ,",
    "it is clear that this configuration possesses @xmath5 localized bosonic zero modes as it spontaneously breaks translational invariance .",
    "it follows that the minimal content of the moduli space takes the form",
    "_ susy^min = ^d  . for solitons within theories of extended supersymmetry",
    ", @xmath3 may acquire additional bosonic dimensions , due to the enforced khler or hyperkhler structure .",
    "we would now like to argue that there are _ at least _",
    "@xmath5 fermionic zero modes of the soliton configuration if the bulk theory possesses linearly realized supersymmetry . more precisely , we will consider a soliton in a globally supersymmetric field theory .",
    "furthermore , to simplify the discussion , we will assume a real representation for the superalgebra . and 4 which we will focus on here , but the argument should generalize appropriately to dimensions without majorana spinors . ] since two susy variations commute to a translation , @xmath18s(x ) \\propto \\ga^\\mu \\ptl_\\mu\\ , s(x)$ ]",
    ", it follows that if there are @xmath5 broken translational generators , there are at least @xmath5 broken supersymmetry generators , and thus @xmath5 fermionic zero modes . in practice , the number may of course be larger on account of lorentz invariance or extended susy .    while this matching is essentially enforced by the representation theory of the worldvolume superalgebra in many examples , it is interesting that this simple argument also applies even if the worldvolume of the soliton is 0 + 1-dimensional , for which supersymmetric quantum mechanics in principle imposes no fixed relation between the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , we did not need to assume the existence of a well - defined fermion parity @xmath19 on the states , and thus representations could exist which are not bose - fermi paired . as simple illustrations of the minimal one - to - one matching consider first a putative bps vortex in a theory with minimal susy ( i.e. two supercharges ) in 2 + 1d .",
    "such a configuration would require a worldvolume description with two bosonic zero modes , but only one fermionic mode .",
    "this is not permitted by the argument above , and indeed no configurations of this type are known .",
    "vortices always exhibit at least two fermionic zero modes and are thus bps only in theories in 2 + 1d . as a second example , consider an su(2 ) yang - mills instanton . within the superconformal algebra they possess eight bosonic , but only four fermionic , zero modes , and are indeed bps .",
    "however , to exist as solitons we must lift them to 4 + 1d where the minimal superconformal algebra possesses sixteen generators and bps instantons then exhibit eight fermionic zero modes restoring the minimal one - to - one matching .",
    "proceeding further , one notes that a one - to - one matching between bosonic and fermionic modes ( in practice a two - to - one matching of phase space variables ) is possible only in the absence of nontrivial constraints from lorentz invariance , namely when the worldvolume is 0 + 1 or 1 + 1-dimensional .",
    "these cases still cover the majority of solitons present within theories in 3 + 1d , and this minimal matching is known to occur in many cases .",
    "the first example where lorentz invariance does impose a constraint arises for bps walls in 3 + 1d , where the mode matching must be one - to - two .",
    "it is this case that will be of interest here .",
    "the discussion above focused on the translational or , more generally , the ` super - goldstone ' sector of the moduli space @xmath3 .",
    "the constraints imposed by lorentz invariance on @xmath6 are the same , but in general the realization of supersymmetry may be somewhat different .",
    "this is the issue to which we turn next .",
    "the realization of susy in the translational sector of the moduli space is highly constrained by kinematics .",
    "in contrast , the reduced moduli space may contain moduli which are unrelated to translational zero modes and the structure of the superalgebra .",
    "of course , this is not necessarily the case if we consider a multi - soliton configuration where @xmath6 will include moduli corresponding to relative translations , but we have in mind a situation where @xmath6 is instead associated with other broken global symmetries . in this case",
    ", we will argue that the reduced moduli space may exhibit an apparent ` enhancement ' of supersymmetry at the two - derivative level relative to the full dynamics on @xmath2 .    to motivate why supersymmetry enhancement for the low energy dynamics on @xmath6 can be rather natural ,",
    "we will first present an explicit example .",
    "consider an sigma model in 1 + 1d with target space @xmath20 accompanied by its round metric @xcite , for which we introduce spherical polar coordinates @xmath21 , ds^2 = r .",
    "we also turn on a ( real ) superpotential , ( ) = m  , which depends on only one of the angular coordinates parametrizing the @xmath20 .",
    "the theory then has two vacua at @xmath22 .",
    "classical bps kinks exist which interpolate between the two vacua , having mass m_sol = z = 2 m  , and satisfying the bogomolnyi equation , _ z ^a = g^ab _ b w ( )  .",
    "[ bogeqn ] the solutions have the simple sine - gordon form _",
    "sol(z ) = 2 , _ sol=_0 , _ sol=_0  , [ sgsol ] exhibiting three bosonic moduli @xmath23 .",
    "these bosonic moduli are goldstone modes for the symmetries broken by the wall : @xmath24 is associated with the breaking of translation invariance ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 arise from the so(3 ) global symmetry of the target space which is preserved in the vacua but broken to so(2 ) by the kink solution .",
    "we thus anticipate that @xmath25 and @xmath26 coordinatize the coset so(3)/so(2 ) @xmath27 .",
    "this may be verified by inserting the solution into the bosonic lagrangian and computing the induced metric for the bosonic zero modes @xcite , on allowing for weak time - dependence , [ coord ] ds^2_m = 2 m dz_0 ^ 2 + h_ij dx^i dx^j = 2 m dz_0 ^ 2 +  , i , j=1,2  , where @xmath28 is the metric of the reduced moduli space @xmath6 .",
    "the bosonic moduli space is thus = = s^2  , with the natural metric on each factor .",
    "let us now consider the fermionic sector .",
    "the @xmath20 coordinates @xmath29 are partnered under susy by a set of two - component majorana spinors , @xmath30 , @xmath31 . for each bosonic zero mode @xmath32 ,",
    "one finds a corresponding ( one - component ) fermionic partner @xmath33 in the lower component of @xmath30 , ps .",
    "^a_sol = ^i (    c 0 + 1    ) +  .",
    "only one of these modes is guarunteed to exist by virtue of the fact that the solution is classically 1/2-bps and thus breaks one of the two supercharges .",
    "the broken supercharge is realized as q_1 = 2z ^z  , in terms of this ` goldstino ' mode . here",
    "@xmath34 is the superpartner of @xmath24 .",
    "we now come to a rather surprising feature of this system .",
    "the reduced moduli space @xmath6 is a khler manifold and , since the bosonic and fermionic zero modes are paired , exhibits supersymmetry .",
    "one of these supercharges is @xmath35 , the unbroken charge present in the bulk theory , while the second which we will call @xmath36 exists only due to the complex structure @xmath37 associated with @xmath6 . in the coordinate system ( [ coord ] ) , j= (    cc0&1 + -1 & 0    )  .",
    "[ compstruc ] we can represent the supercharges as . ] ^i \\ {    l q_2 = h_ij ^i ^j + _ 2 = h_ij j^j_k ^i ^k    . and , noting that @xmath38 , one can verify that they satisfy the algebra of sqm , \\{q^i , q^j } = h_sqm ^ij  , where @xmath39 is the worldline hamiltonian . introducing the complex coordinate w = e^i_0 [ ccoord ] on @xmath6 , and its fermionic partner ps .",

    "at this point we should emphasize that the arguments for enhanced supersymmetry presented above refer to the low energy or two - derivative sector of the worldvolume theory . since supersymmetry does not enforce this enhancement , nor indeed the khler structure of the reduced moduli space",
    ", it seems inevitable that higher derivative terms on the worldvolume will not respect supersymmetry . we will not attempt to verify this in detail , as we will focus on the worldvolume vacuum structure for which the two - derivative sector of the theory is sufficient .    in this specific example",
    ", one can show that on quantization there are no supersymmetric vacua , and thus no quantum bps kinks , since @xmath40 is bounded from below by the scalar curvature @xmath41 of @xmath6 which is clearly positive .",
    "more precisely @xcite , @xmath35 can be realized as the dirac operator on @xmath6 , q_2 = ^j ( -i _ j )  , and thus one finds ( q_2)^2 = h_sqm = -^2 +  , [ liech ] where @xmath42 is the laplacian on @xmath6 .",
    "although we focused on one particular example , the mechanism for susy enhancement exhibited above clearly generalizes readily to , for example , sigma models with target spaces which are ( nontrivial ) u(1 ) bundles @xmath43 over khler manifolds @xmath44 ( e.g. regular sasakian manifolds ) , where the soliton profile in the transverse coordinate @xmath45 lies entirely within the @xmath46 fibre , s^1(z ) & r & + & & + & k & and it would clearly be interesting to explore other generalizations .",
    "it is worth emphasizing here that a global feature of this kind is ultimately what is responsible for enhancing the supersymmetry on @xmath6 . in other words ,",
    "the existence of a globally defined khler form on @xmath6 , while not strictly proven through our local considerations , is ensured by an underlying geometric structure .",
    "note also that the nontriviality of the fibration is a necessary condition ensuring that the @xmath47 zero modes are normalizable , i.e. that they are localized to the kink .    here",
    "we will note only one natural extension of the example above , which is directly relevant to our subsequent discussion of bps walls in sqcd .",
    "we can embed the @xmath20 model in a khler @xmath48 sigma model with target space @xmath49 .",
    "the bosonic soliton solutions persist , and depend only on the base @xmath20 coordinates .",
    "consequently , the bosonic moduli space is unchanged .",
    "however , the cotangent directions supply an additional set of fermionic zero modes , so that the bosonic and fermionic moduli are now paired one - to - two , and the reduced moduli space preserves the action of four supercharges constructed as above with @xmath50 reinterpreted as a two component majorana spinor .",
    "this in fact is crucial as the system can then be lifted to a nonchiral theory in 1 + 1d with @xmath48 supersymmetry and , more importantly , the natural theory in 2 + 1d on the worldvolume of a domain wall .    in the next section , we will review the origin of this geometric structure within the context of bps domain walls in sqcd , and describe in some detail the worldvolume dynamics on the reduced moduli space .",
    "in the first part of this section we briefly review the arguments which determine the topology of the reduced @xmath9-wall moduli space in su(@xmath7 ) sqcd with @xmath1 flavors @xcite .",
    "we then present a more explicit construction for su(2 ) , exhibiting the enhancement of supersymmetry on the reduced moduli space , and describing how the imposition of a hierarchical structure for the quark mass matrix leads to a potential which lifts the flavor moduli .",
    "this potential , at least for linear deformations , is geometrically the norm squared of a u(1 ) killing vector .",
    "sqcd with @xmath1 flavors is obtained by adding @xmath7 chiral superfields , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , transforming respectively in the fundamental and anti - fundamental representations of the gauge group , to the fields of sym with gauge group su(@xmath7 ) .",
    "this matter content will ensure that the gauge symmetry is completely broken in any vacuum in which the matter fields have a nonzero vacuum expectation value .",
    "provided the mass gap is sufficiently large , the gauge fields may then be integrated out , obtaining a low energy effective description in terms of the meson moduli @xmath54 .",
    "the superpotential describing the resulting low energy dynamics is given by = tr(m ) + ( detm-_n^2n ) , [ sp ] in terms of the meson matrix @xmath55 , the dynamical scale @xmath8 , and a lagrange multiplier @xmath56 .",

    "these moduli are determined by the flavor symmetries broken by the wall and parametrize a khler manifold . in particular , it is only the induced metric on this space which is sensitive to the precise specification of quark masses ; the topology is invariant .",

    "this worldvolume structure also has important consequences for worldvolume bps solitons , a subject that we turn to in the next section .",
    "the crucial distinction to be made here with the algebra arising for kinks in the @xmath20 model is that with two - component fermions the model has an additional potential term associated with the riemann tensor , v = - r_ijkl |^i ^j |^k ^l  , with @xmath141 , which precisely cancels the zero - point curvature term in ( [ liech ] ) in the quantum action of the unbroken supercharges on the ground states .",

    "this consistency suggests that although we have only considered the perturbation at linear order , the resulting physical picture is valid more generally .    in concluding this section",
    ", we will comment briefly on some subtleties that arise in extending these arguments to higher @xmath7 .",
    "firstly , since the reduced moduli space for 1-walls , @xmath169 , can always be embedded within a suitably oriented real section of the meson moduli space det@xmath170 , it seems clear that the one - to - two pairing between bosonic and fermionic zero modes will hold more generally .",
    "this ensures that multiplets when realized in terms of susy are necessarily reducible , although this structure may of course be lifted once one goes beyond the two derivative level . with this matching , susy",
    "would follow immediately given a khler metric on the reduced moduli space .",
    "it is this latter property , namely that the induced geometry is in fact _ globally _ khler , which appears difficult to prove in generality . in the symmetric mass regime",
    ", it of course follows directly from the construction of the moduli space as a khler quotient .",
    "however , this regime is not weakly coupled and in the tractable hierarchical mass regime one loses the isometry constraints on the induced metric . nonetheless , the explicit construction in the su(2 ) case is certainly suggestive that supersymmetry enhancement also arises for generic @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that this conclusion is rather novel when the khler structure is not imposed by the residual supersymmetry of the bps state . for point - like or string - like solitons",
    "one has additional freedom through the possibility of realizing susy using one - component fermions .",
    "indeed , this is the conventional manner in which worldline theories for e.g. lumps in khler sigma models , and monopoles in sym , get around the apparent contradiction of being 1/2-bps states while at the same time having a khler , or respectively hyper - khler , moduli space @xcite .",
    "the worldvolume theories in question can be thought of as reductions of ( 0,2 ) and ( 0,4 ) sigma models in 1 + 1d , and this structure can be understood from the fact that the same bosonic moduli space arises in theories with twice as much supersymmetry , namely hyperkhler sigma models and sym , where the additional fermionic zero modes restore the ` nonchiral ' structure to the worldvolume superalgebra .",
    "in this section , we will turn our attention to a second set of bps configurations present in sqcd .",
    "an inspection of the super - translation algebra in 3 + 1d shows that it admits central charges supported by domain walls and also string - like sources ( see appendix ) .",
    "the corresponding charges transform in the ( 0,1 ) and ( 1/2,1/2 ) lorentz representations respectively .",
    "the sqcd theories considered here are not expected to exhibit bps string solutions , but one has the possibility of forming ( 1/4-bps ) intersections or junctions of domain walls supported by both wall and string charges .",
    "one class of 1/4-bps junctions arises from a multi - spoke configuration of @xmath7 domain walls in theories with @xmath7 degenerate vacua .",
    "the 1/4-bps criterion amounts to the statement that the superpotential evaluated on a path through each wall surrounding the junction traces out a closed polygon @xcite .",

    ", the fact that the only configurations currently known which saturate this bound in theories are wall - junction configurations may partially be explained by considering the number of localized zero modes , as discussed in section  ii .",
    "the one broken supercharge furnishes the junction with a single fermionic zero mode .",
    "this is paired with a single bosonic zero mode whose origin is best understood by viewing the junction as a kink - soliton on the wall worldvolume .",
    "the bosonic zero mode then arises from the breaking of translational invariance along the wall . a second translational zero mode , associated with the position of the junction in the orthogonal direction is not localized as it corresponds to a shift of wall itself . in this sense",
    "the worldvolume structure of the junction is quite distinct from a localized source such as a vortex .        in 3 + 1d",
    "this structure has a natural interpretation in terms of the extension of the zero modes to worldvolume fields in 1 + 1d .",
    "i.e. we can now complete the single fermionic zero mode to a chiral fermion , which we can choose to be left moving . in the bosonic sector the single translational zero mode is completed to a bosonic field , which we can decompose into a left and a right - mover . only the left - mover will be paired with the fermionic zero mode under the residual chiral ( 0,1 ) worldsheet supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "now , when we turn on @xmath178 , we can interpret the resulting junction which remains bps as equivalent to the ` bare ' @xmath180 junction superposed with a left moving wave of momentum @xmath178 .",
    "this configuration is illustrated schematically in fig .",

    "we first consider the hierarchical regime for gauge group su(2 ) , and integrate out the second flavor as in the corresponding discussion of sect .",
    "3 . since we take the decoupling limit directly , and thus solve the constraint @xmath183 explicitly for @xmath88 , it is useful to introduce another dimensionless field @xmath184 in the form @xmath185 , such that after decoupling = ( y^2 + y^-2 ) , = |yy",

    "note that we can interpret ( [ eleven ] ) as implying that the thickness of the junction in the @xmath197 direction is of the same order as the thickness of the wall itself in the @xmath203 direction and is large , @xmath212 .",
    "because of this fact the presence of an unknown core in the wall junction ( which is inevitable since the @xmath184 trajectory runs through the strong coupling domain ) is unimportant numerically since the relevant scale is @xmath213 .",
    "however , this point necessarily means that the junction can not fully be described within this effective theory , and we can ask whether the worldvolume perspective may help in this regard .",
    "the preceding analysis indicates that the @xmath182 system is rather inadequate for describing the detailed structure of the junction solution .",
    "in particular , the boundary conditions at infinity in the plane transverse to the axis of symmetry ensure the following symmetry of the solution , y(z ) |y(|z )  . along with continuity",
    ", this implies that the field @xmath191 must pass through zero at the core of the junction .",
    "since the potential diverges at this point , we see that the description breaks down within the shaded domain sketched at the right in fig .  3 , and we can not expect to find a solution ( even numerically ) in this region .",
    "a similar singularity is seen to arise , for similar reasons , for analogous 2-wall junctions for higher @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting then to address this question directly from the worldvolume point of view , by adding an additional light flavor so that the 2 component walls arise from the dynamics of a @xmath140 sigma model , or more precisely a massive sigma model where the mass term is identified with @xmath214 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this theory possesses 1/2-bps kink solitons , and it is natural to identify these kinks as the worldvolume description of 1/4-bps 2-wall junctions",

( [ eleven ] ) from a direct analysis of the 1-flavor model , despite being derived in the small @xmath219 regime .",
    "it is worthy of note that the earlier determination that the worldvolume ` real ' mass perturbation was indeed a real parameter also finds a nice consistency check in this expression .",
    "the resulting junction tension depends non - holomorphically on @xmath222 as one expects from the bulk point of view .    examining ( [ tj2 ] ) we observe that as the mass splitting is reduced we become sensitive to quantum effects on the worldvolume , and indeed this is to be expected as the bulk theory is also strongly coupled for @xmath223 . in this regime , the junction configuration is still described by a @xmath140 kink , and we conclude that the solution will be nonsingular whenever the worldvolume ir dynamics is sufficient to generate a mass gap .",
    "for example , it is sufficient to compactify one of the spatial dimensions on an @xmath46 of circumference @xmath171 .",
    "the effective 1 + 1d dynamics then generates a dynamical scale of the form _",
    "wv = ( - ) , g^2 ( ) =  , [ law ] and it is this parameter which enters the ( 1/2,1/2 ) central charge and sets the tension , or ` effective mass ' , of the junction , reduced now to a localized soliton .",
    "this determines a contribution to @xmath206 which is necessarily independent of the contribution from the walls .",
    "unfortunately , since the relevance of such a worldvolume scale only becomes apparent on entering the strong coupling regime when @xmath223 it is difficult to make any concrete identification with bulk 3 + 1d parameters .",
    "worldsheet dynamics of ` nonabelian ' vortices in the higgs phase @xcite . ]",
    "nonetheless , this scale does have a direct physical interpretation in 3 + 1d as the intrinsic junction tension .",
    "the enhancement of worldvolume supersymmetry for the reduced wall moduli space also has important consequences for this identification of 1/4-bps bulk junctions with 1/2-bps worldvolume kinks .",
    "in particular , while the junction preserves only one of the bulk supercharges , the kink preserves in addition one of the supernumerary charges present on the worldvolume .",
    "moreover , since the junction not only preserves two worldvolume supercharges , but also breaks two , it necessarily exhibits two fermionic zero modes . recalling the discussion at the start of sect .",
    "iv , we see that this is not the minimal ` chiral ' content that one would anticipate based on the breaking of bulk supersymmetry . in actual fact , the kink solutions also have two bosonic moduli , the center of mass position and the phase @xmath224 as is apparent from ( [ juncsg ] ) .",
    "thus the moduli space is two - dimensional _ kink =  _ 1  , where the reduced moduli space is @xmath225 .",
    "note that only one of these bosonic moduli  the translational mode  would have been anticipated from a consideration of the bulk kinematics .",
    "we see that the bosonic and fermionic moduli form two ( 0,1 ) chiral multiplets and two bosonic singlets . on the worldvolume ,",
    "this structure is enforced by the broken supersymmetry . however , from the bulk point of view the second ( 0,1 ) chiral multiplet and singlet are not required by supersymmetry considerations , but presumably correspond to a goldstone multiplet arising through the breaking of flavor symmetry , as is the case for the wall itself .    in this context",
    ", the worldvolume susy resolves an apparent paradox that arises when one tries to verify that these junction solutions are bps saturated at the quantum level . in particular , were the worldvolume to possess only susy , putative bps junctions would have to be realized as one - component multiplets .",
    "an index to count such multiplets was introduced in @xcite , which is formally expressed as",
    "_ lsv = \\{trq_broken}^2  , in terms of the broken supercharge .",
    "an observation of @xcite which is particularly relevant here is that the index necessarily vanishes when the fermion parity @xmath19 is well - defined .",
    "this indicates that the multiplet is generally reducible ( containing two states ) and can lift from the bps bound . in the present case , as noted above , the kinks have an even number of bosonic , and consequently fermionic , moduli . on quantization ,",
    "the latter furnish a representation of the clifford algebra , in this case @xmath226 , from which we can construct @xmath227 which represents @xmath19 . thus one would necessarily conclude that no short multiplets are allowed and there would be no reason to expect that these junctions should saturate the",
    "1/4-bps bound in 3 + 1d . this would be rather puzzling , and indeed as we have discussed this problem is resolved due to the enhanced susy on the reduced moduli space so that the junctions lie in bps multiplets of susy , and are instead counted by the cfiv index on the worldvolume .",
    "an immediate technical advantage of the realization of junctions as bps kinks on the wall worldvolume , is that we can utilize our knowledge of these configurations for arbitrary @xmath7 to infer analogous results for junctions , which are in fact rather difficult to obtain directly .",
    "thus we now identify 1/4-bps 2-wall junctions in the su(@xmath7 ) theory with @xmath1 with kinks in the worldvolume @xmath169 sigma model deformed by the relevant real mass terms .",
    "we will limit our remarks here to two issues , namely the multiplicity of 2-wall junctions , and their tension .    in order to make this discussion concrete",
    "we must again resort to compactifying the theory on a circle to ensure that the low energy effective theory on the wall worldvolume is 1 + 1-dimensional and develops a mass gap .",
    "we can then vary the quark masses across the range where the dynamical scale @xmath228 becomes important and , for example , sit in the strong coupling region where @xmath229 . note that whether or not this restriction changes the physical conclusion is tied to the question of whether entering the strong coupling domain in the bulk effectively induces a mass gap within the ( decompactified ) worldvolume theory .    due to susy ,",
    "the junction multiplicity is formally given by the cfiv index as noted above .",
    "focusing just on minimal walls for arbitrary @xmath7 , a generic intersection between two of the @xmath7 possible walls , will connect walls differing by @xmath230 units of phase  we will refer to this as a @xmath230-junction .",

    "in practice , as noted above , the result can be somewhat different in the limit @xmath232 , which may in fact be the only accessible regime in 2 + 1d .",
    "in particular , in this regime in 1 + 1d one can turn on an arbitrary integer ` dyonic ' charge @xcite , due to a coupling to the corresponding u(1 ) current in the superalgebra @xcite , although this is also reflected in a change in the mass .",
    "only a certain number of these states survive ( as above ) in the limit @xmath231 , due to the presence of marginal stability curves @xcite .    turning to the tension , in the hierarchical regime @xmath232 ,",
    "the result is a natural generalization of ( [ kinktens ] ) determined by the various real mass terms .",
    "more interesting perhaps is that , within the compactified regime with @xmath233 , the result translated directly from that for @xmath169 kinks is t_p = _ wv  .",
    "[ dsf ] although this is a rather familiar formula in the context of wall - like solitons , it takes on an interesting new interpretation here as the junction is a string - like source , albeit wrapped on a small circle in the present construction .",
    "since this result is naively protected by the enhanced worldvolume susy , ) indicates that , due to the embedding , the dependence of the tension on the mass scale in the hierarchical limit is not holomorphic .",
    "this is in accord with expectations for the junction charge in the bulk . ]",
    "we see that the wall junctions actually realize the ` sine formula ' for the ratio of ` string ' tensions for differing values of @xmath230 first observed for strings in softly broken sym by douglas and shenker @xcite . )",
    "was discussed recently in @xcite . ]",
    "this structure is not expected to apply to generic @xmath230-strings in confining vacua of sym , since these states are non - bps , but here we find a situation where the sine - formula appears to be exact , due to the enhanced susy on the worldvolume .",
    "however , we should reiterate that this discussion has been framed within a specific scenario .",
    "if we decompactify the extra spatial dimension , then to retain control over the vacuum structure , one needs to reintroduce a hierarchy for the quark masses . the kink spectrum , and also the tension , then changes considerably on moving outside a ` curve of marginal stability ' , and many more states are present classified by u(1 ) charges associated with the residual abelian flavor symmetries in the hierarchical case .",
    "after decompactification , if we try to remove the hierarchy the system re - enters a strong coupling regime that at present appears intractable .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed exploration of the worldvolume moduli space dynamics of 1/2-bps domain walls in sqcd with gauge group su(2 ) and @xmath13 flavors .",
    "we have also discussed how novel 1/4-bps 2-wall junctions may be realized as kinks within the worldvolume theory .",
    "we concentrated on the su(2 ) example where much of the analysis could be performed explicitly , but we anticipate that most of the conclusions should extend to the generic su(@xmath7 ) case with @xmath1 flavors .",
    "in particular , the appearance of an enhanced worldvolume supersymmetry on the reduced moduli space is essentially guaranteed by the corresponding construction as a khler quotient . in this concluding section",
    ", we will make a couple of more speculative remarks on localized worldvolume solitons which may ( or may not ) find a bulk interpretation .",
    "the algebra in 2 + 1d includes , in addition to a tensorial central charge for the 1 + 1d kink which we have interpreted as a 2-wall junction , a poincar invariant charge supported by localized lump solitons .",
    "when the worldvolume theory is naturally embedded in the relevant linear sigma model , lumps are realized as semi - local vortices . consequently , with reference to the interpretation of such walls as d - branes for sym strings @xcite , it is tantalizing to speculate that these configurations may have a relation to the endpoints of sqcd strings .",
    "note in particular that at energy scales below the uv cutoff on the wall , of order @xmath234 , such strings are stable to quark pair production .",
    "the result @xmath12 for the wall multiplicity is also consistent with the interpretation that 1-walls lie in the fundamental representation of su(n ) , or more generally admit an action of the corresponding weyl group , and form antisymmetric bound states . moreover , although these configurations are bps on the worldvolume , they would indeed be non - bps within the bulk .    in spite of these intriguing hints",
    "it seems difficult , for several reasons , to make a precise identification of this type .",
    "for example , lumps carry integer charges @xmath235 , rather than charges under @xmath236 that one might associate with the center of the gauge group .",
    "a contraction of the charge lattice , @xmath237 , might occur due to physics occurring above the worldvolume uv cutoff , but there is another more significant roadblock in the way of a quantitative study of this question .",
    "this is the fact that in the hierarchical mass regime where the theory is tractable there is a potential on the moduli space . in the presence of such a deformation ,",
    "lumps are no longer stable , via derrick s theorem , unless one turns on additional u(1 ) charges .",
    "such time - dependent @xmath238-lumps are known , for @xmath239 , to have a ring - like structure and locally carry the junction charge @xcite .",
    "thus these configurations appear as domain wall bubbles on the worldvolume .",
    "it is far from clear what may happen to these configurations as one sends @xmath240 and returns to strong coupling , and this hinders a direct bulk interpretation .    in a similar regard",
    ", we can also speculate about configurations which one might dub ` junctions of junctions ' .",
    "in particular , the counting argument for junctions described above suggests that , even in the minimal su(2 ) case , there are two inequivalent junctions .",
    "one may then anticipate that a further intersection , now within the worldvolume , would be possible  a 1/4-bps state on the worldvolume ( since it sources both the kink and lump central charges ) , but again non - bps in the bulk .",

    "their dynamical role was subsequently made apparent by witten and olive @xcite , who showed that such charges are supported by the topological charges of solitons . while it was appreciated for some time that not all central charges are lorentz scalars ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the dynamical role of these additional tensorial charges was not fully understood until somewhat later , when they were shown to be nonzero in the presence of extended objects ( @xmath230-branes ) within supergravity @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "their occurrence in sym in @xmath243 ( via a quantum anomaly ) was first observed in @xcite .    we will concentrate on the algebras in @xmath14 and 4 , for which the analyses in @xcite for @xmath244 , and @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for @xmath245 and 4 , are particularly relevant .",
    "while most of what follows comprises review material collected here for completeness , we will extend the discussion in @xcite of vectorial central charges , namely those with the lorentz structure of @xmath246 .      limiting ourselves to two , three and four dimensions we observe that the minimal number of supercharges is 2 , 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "two - dimensional theories with a single supercharge , although algebraically possible , require the loss of @xmath64 and @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , if one wishes to keep the distinction between ` bosons ' and ` fermions ' , the minimal number of supercharges in @xmath244 is two .    working in a real representation with @xmath247 supercharges ,",
