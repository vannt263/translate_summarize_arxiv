    "this work concerns brauer tree algebras , a widely studied class of algebras of finite representation type which includes all blocks of cyclic defect group in modular group representation theory . in the last twenty - five years",
    "modular group representation theory has been considerably enriched by the introduction of methods from algebra representation theory , foremost among them the theory of tilting complexes in @xcite , which led to the brou conjecture that every block whose defect group is abelian is derived equivalent to its green correspondent .",
    "a block of cyclic defect group is a brauer tree algebra and its green correspondent is a brauer star algebra .",
    "rickard proved @xcite that every brauer tree algebra has a tilting complex which makes it derived equivalent to the correspondng brauer star algebra .",
    "schaps - zakay showed that the tilting complexes in the opposite direction can be constructed form irreducible project tive complexes of length two .",
    "since all the projectives of the brauer star algebra have the same simple form , the endomorphism algebra of such a tilting complex is easily constructed and the structure of the brauer tree can be read off from the complex , making them an excellent introduction to tilting theory .",
    "there have been two main approaches to the tilting theory of brauer tree algebras : the all - at - once approach , going back to rickard @xcite ( later involving pointing ) , and the step - by - step approach going back to knig and zimmermann [ kz1 ] , later formulated in terms of mutations by aihara @xcite and used recently by chan @xcite and zvonarevna @xcite . in this project",
    "we propose to combine and compare the two approaches .",

    "if the edges of the tree are labelled , then each vertex can be given the same label as the first edge on this unique path .",
    "a _ mutation reduction _ is a mutation or sequence of mutations such that the distance of each vertex from the exceptional vertex does not ever increase , and such that at least one such distance actually decreases .",

    "a mutation centered at a primary edge connected to an edge adjacent to the exceptional vertex is a mutation reduction .",
    "3 .   after a complete mutation reduction , all the edges from a given branch form an interval around the brauer star , and these intervals follow the counterclockwise ordering of the branches .    1 .   if the mutation is not centered at a primary edge , then the mutation reattaches the center at the far end of the edge before it in the cyclic ordering , which is at greater distance from the exceptional vertex , in contradiction to our assumption that we have a mutation reduction .",
    "2 .   the only mutation which can change the branch structure under a mutation reduction is a mutation by a primary edge @xmath228 connected to an edge @xmath83 adjacent to the exceptional vertex .",
    "the effect of such a mutation is to is to create a new branch by lopping off @xmath228 and the subgraph @xmath88 of all edges connected to the exceptional vertex through the center @xmath228 of the mutation .",

    "the other branch will be rooted at @xmath83 , will be changed only in that @xmath228 and @xmath88 were removed , and will follow the branch rooted at @xmath228 immediately in the counterclockwise ordering at @xmath150 . +   + it remains to show that this operation was actually a mutation reduction .",

    "finally , the remaining edges of @xmath88 , now all connected to the exceptional vertex via @xmath233 instead of @xmath234 , remain at exactly the same distance that they had before .",

    "each branch is eventually split entirely into separate leaves attached to the the exceptional vertex .",
