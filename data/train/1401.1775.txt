    "the search for new physics beyond the standard model is continuing at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "although we are yet to see any clear hint , there is reason for exhilaration in another way , namely , the discovery of a boson of mass @xmath2 125 gev  @xcite . the properties of this particle are very similar to the higgs boson predicted in the standard model ( sm ) , but possibilities of some new physics information contained in it can not yet be ruled out .",
    "thus a great deal of attention has shifted to the exploration of physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) in the electroweak symmetry breaking sector .",
    "one vexing issue , often mentioned as a motivation for bsm physics , is the identification of a mechanism for neutrino mass generation .",
    "this basically means finding some explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses as compared to those for the other fermions , and also the very different nature of mixing evinced in the neutrino ( or more precisely , lepton ) sector  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural that efforts to unravel new physics in the higgs sector will sometimes be guided by considerations related to neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "the lhc signals of any scenario proposed in this context are also of undeniable interest  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a model which not only accounts for the tiny neutrino masses , but also plays a role in the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "we are interested in a two higgs doublet model with right - handed neutrinos proposed by gabriel and nandi  @xcite .",
    "the essential idea is that neutrinos , like all other fermions , have dirac masses , but are much lighter than the others because their masses come from a different higgs doublet .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the neutrinos can still be @xmath3 .",
    "this is ensured by giving a very tiny vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath2 ev to the neutral component of one of the higgs doublets , which due to a @xmath4 symmetry couples only with the neutrino sector .",
    "the charged higgs in this model therefore has very different properties when compared to other standard two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "it is found to couple very weakly with the quarks while a large coupling with charged leptons and right - handed neutrinos is allowed .",
    "thus , the leptonic mode is the most promising decay channel of this charged higgs for @xmath3 yukawa couplings in the neutrino sector @xcite . depending upon the mass of the charged higgs other decay modes",
    "are also possible . in a similar model proposed by davidson and logan @xcite , which considers a @xmath5 global symmetry in place of the discrete @xmath4 symmetry ,",
    "only leptonic decay modes of the charged higgs were allowed .",
    "the branching probabilities for the decay of the charged higgs are very sensitive to the small vev of the additional doublet , which couples to the neutrinos @xcite .",
    "as recent astrophysical bounds on the neutrino yukawa couplings in such extensions of the sm suggest that the vev of the second doublet can not be in the sub - ev range @xcite , the charged higgs can no longer decay dominantly into a leptonic final state .",
    "it turns out that the main decay mode for the charged higgs is into a @xmath0 boson and a light neutral scalar present in the model . in this work we mainly focus on the challenges presented for a charged higgs search at the lhc , when it decays through the @xmath0 mode .",
    "we study the pair production of the charged higgs at the lhc and consider its decay to @xmath0 boson and the neutral scalar .",
    "the signal is identified by two isolated leptons and a large missing energy .",
    "we have analyzed the most dominant sm background subprocesses that affect the signal , to estimate the signal significance .",
    "the study is carried out at both the 8 tev and 14 tev center - of - mass energies for the lhc .",
    "we find that it is practically impossible to achieve any significant signal for the charged higgs in this model with the available integrated luminosity at 8 tev .",
    "the situation is much more optimistic at 14 tev , if one waits for a sizeable luminosity to accumulate .",
    "there , on applying appropriate kinematical event selection procedure , a signal significance of 5@xmath1 at 14 tev can be reached with an integrated luminosity of 4000 fb@xmath6 for @xmath7 gev .",
    "the observation of the signal is found to be more promising for heavier charged higgs masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we describe the model briefly .",
    "various constraints on the model parameters are discussed in section [ sec : constraints ] . in section [ sec : analysis ] , we discuss the charged higgs pair production and major backgrounds for the signal at the lhc .",
    "results are presented in section [ sec : results ] and we conclude in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the model under consideration is based on the symmetry group @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to the matter fields in the sm , the model includes two scalar doublets @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and three @xmath12 singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "all the sm fermions and the scalar doublet @xmath10 are even under the discrete symmetry @xmath4 , while the right - handed neutrinos and the scalar doublet @xmath11 are odd under @xmath4 . the most general scalar potential and the yukawa interaction of leptons with the scalar doublets which respect the @xmath8 symmetry are @xcite , @xmath15 , \\label{eq : pot } \\\\ { \\cal l}_y & = &   y_l^{ij}\\ ; { \\bar{\\rm \\psi}}^{l , i}_l l_r^j \\chi + y_{\\nu_l}^{ij}\\ ; { \\bar{\\rm \\psi}}^{l , i}_l \\nu_r^j { \\tilde \\phi } + h.c . , \\label{eq : lyuk }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the usual @xmath12 lepton doublet and singlet fields , respectively and @xmath18 represent the matrix elements of the lepton yukawa matrices .",
    "the standard electroweak symmetry is broken spontaneously by giving a vev , @xmath19 246 gev to the @xmath10 doublet , while the @xmath4 symmetry is broken by a vev , @xmath20 for the @xmath11 doublet .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath4 symmetry is arranged for generating small neutrino masses , @xmath21 @xmath20 which can be in the sub - ev / ev range for @xmath3 yukawa couplings .",
    "we note that we are assuming lepton number conservation so that the majorana mass terms for the right handed neutrinos , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are not allowed .",
    "thus the light left - handed neutrinos can not acquire masses via the usual see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "dirac mass , as obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : lyuk ] from the tiny vev of @xmath11 is the only possibility .    as a result of the symmetry breaking ,",
    "the physical higgs sector includes charged scalars @xmath24 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath25 and @xmath1 and a neutral pseudoscalar @xmath26 .",
    "the masses for these particles are given by , @xmath27 where , @xmath28 .",
    "we have neglected the subdominant terms in @xmath20 when deriving these relations .",
    "we note that in the case of exact @xmath4 symmetry , the @xmath1 will be exactly massless .",
    "the breaking of this @xmath4 symmetry with a tiny vev @xmath29 gives mass to the @xmath1 , as well as tiny dirac masses to the observed neutrinos .",
    "therefore in this model , the neutral scalar field @xmath1 is very light and the field @xmath25 behaves like the sm higgs boson.the cp - even scalars ( @xmath30 ) are the mass eigenstates and they are related to the weak eigenstates @xmath31 by the mixing angle @xmath32 : @xmath33 where , @xmath34 this mixing can be neglected because @xmath35 .",
    "it is also clear from the above equations that @xmath36 lies around the electroweak scale .    in the lepton yukawa sector the above symmetry breaking leads to neutrino masses given by , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the eigenvalues of the neutrino yukawa matrix .",
    "the yukawa interaction of the charged higgs with the leptons can then be written down following eq .",
    "[ eq : lyuk ] as , @xmath39 in the above equation , @xmath40 represents the flavour index while @xmath41 is the index representing neutrino components in mass eigenstate .",
    "the @xmath42 are the charged lepton yukawa couplings while @xmath43 represent the elements in the pmns matrix  @xcite for the mixing of the neutrino flavours .. ] note that the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : yukawa ] is clearly sub - dominant and negligible ( suppressed by the factor @xmath44 ) when compared to the first term and can therefore be safely neglected when considering the interaction strength of the charged higgs with the leptons . as the couplings of charged higgs with sm quarks are also generated through terms similar to the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : yukawa ] , the charged higgs is very weakly coupled to quarks and in all practicality behaves as a `` chromophobic '' field .",
    "this property of the charged higgs plays a crucial role in avoiding strong constraints on its mass , otherwise evident in other 2hdm , from low energy physics experiments such as weak meson decays and mixing .",
    "thus in the yukawa sector , only the decay @xmath45 becomes relevant .",

    "[ eq : yukawa ] ) , smaller values of @xmath20 for a fixed neutrino mass increase the branching probability . to highlight this , we consider two sets of values for @xmath20 and show the branching probabilities of the charged higgs decay as a function of its mass in fig .  [ fig : br ] .",
    "note that the neutrino data as shown in table  [ table : nudata ] have been incorporated when calculating the partial decay widths of the charged higgs decaying into the three generations of leptons .",

    "as the model under consideration is quite different from the generic 2hdm and is envisioned to account for the observed neutrino masses and mixing angles , it becomes imperative to first check how the experimental constraints affect the parameters of the model .",

    "note that beyond the charged higgs mass of about 180 gev , the @xmath47 decay channel is also open for @xmath81 100 gev .",
    "this reduces the charged higgs branching ratio in the @xmath82 decay mode and hence reduces the signal cross section further for @xmath83 180 gev .",

    "it means , by considering heavier @xmath26 mass we can ensure a 100% branching ratio of the charged higgs decay to @xmath86 for the heavier charged higgs masses .",
    "it is needless to say that optimization of kinematic cuts is required to estimate the actual signal significance for different charged higgs masses .",
    "for example , despite larger signal cross section for @xmath87 gev , the significance is maximized for a minimum @xmath62 cut of 90 gev . on the other hand , for @xmath88 gev",
    "we have smaller signal cross section but a minimum cut of 130 gev on @xmath62 is more helpful in achieving a larger signal significance .",
    "we note that ( @xmath89 ) combination which we have used to discriminate the signal from the background for @xmath90 gev is not very useful in increasing the significance for lower @xmath71 values .",
    "this is related to the fact that the efficiency of these cuts is closely related to the high @xmath62 cut which in turn is related to the mass difference between the charged higgs and the @xmath0 boson .",
    "when the mass difference between the charged higgs and the @xmath0 boson is not large enough , the application of high @xmath62 cut also kills the signal along with the background .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that for larger charged higgs masses a suitable @xmath65 cut with large enough @xmath62 cut is sufficient . in other words",
    ", if it is possible to apply a very high @xmath62 cut , the additional @xmath64 cut becomes less relevant .",
    "we have studied the signatures of charged higgs boson at the lhc in a two higgs doublet model with right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the model , aiming to derive neutrino masses via preferential yukawa couplings @xmath91(1 ) with an additional higgs doublet , also implies large yukawa coupling of the charged higgs with the light leptons and neutrinos .",
    "however , if cosmological constraints are taken into account , the leptonic decay mode of the charged higgs is highly suppressed and @xmath92 is the dominant decay mode . in this study , the charged higgs pair production via the drell - yan process and its further decay leading to opposite sign di - leptons+missing energy in the final state is considered as the signal .",
    "the major sm background to the signal comes from the process , @xmath93 .",
    "we have done a complete signal - background cut based analysis for both the 8 tev and 14 tev center - of - mass energies at lhc .",
    "the charged higgs masses of 150 gev and 200 gev serve as the benchmark points for our study .",
    "since the signal has additional sources of missing energy , we find that a large @xmath62 cut helps in suppressing the sm background .",
    "also , a combination of minimum cuts on the angle @xmath94 and @xmath64 plays an important role in enhancing the signal significance . due to the lack of sufficient data and the low signal cross section as compared to the background , the observability of the signal is not possible at the lhc with @xmath95 tev and we therefore carry out our analysis for the 14 tev run of the lhc .",

    "<S> we study the signals for a `` fermiophobic '' charged higgs boson present in an extension of the standard model with an additional higgs doublet and right handed neutrinos , responsible for generating dirac - type neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> we study the pair production of the charged higgs at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , which can be relatively light and still allowed by experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the charged higgs decays dominantly into a @xmath0 boson and a very light neutral scalar present in the model , which decays invisibly and passes undetected . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the signal for such a charged higgs is overwhelmed by the standard model background and will prove elusive at the 8 tev run of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we present a cut - flow based analysis to pinpoint a search strategy at the 14 tev run of the lhc which can achieve a signal significance of 5@xmath1 for a given mass range of the charged higgs . </S>"
