    "<S> we stress that , at variance with standard diffusion , for anomalous diffusion there is nothing similar to universality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic derivation of anomalous diffusion is a hard task and it is possible only in few specific cases  @xcite . of course </S>",
    "<S> , the basic ingredient must be an enduring memory : a way to achieve it is to replace standard time derivatives with fractional derivatives in the fokker - planck equations , an approach which is subject of a vast literature  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such an approach is capable , in principle , of describing both caging and superdiffusion within a single model equation , at the price of losing immediate interpretation and plain calculations . in a complementary approach  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a coarse - grained value of @xmath56 ( where only the sign of this quantity is traced ) follows a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) : it takes discrete values with random transition times extracted from a given distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a simplified version of the ctrw is discussed in the sm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we highlight that the ctrw gets a suggestive experimental confirmation in the observations of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ctrw ] : indeed the ctrw model quantitatively connects the observed slow decay of @xmath84 to superdiffusion .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ : an experimental study of dense granular mesorheology allows to probe time - scales in a range of six orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> such an investigation reveals a complex scenario with different dynamical behaviors in four frequency or time regions . </S>",
    "<S> three crucial features are observed at large density and low temperature : a `` resonant '' caging phenomenon at intermediate scales , non - white noise at fast scales , and super - diffusion at long times . </S>",
    "<S> the caging phenomenon is compatible with a diffusing harmonic cage model , while superdiffusion seems to be rooted in the long inversion times appearing in the dynamics @xmath56 , possibly related to creeping rotating motion of the granular media . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed investigation of _ transitions _ is in order : a gas - liquid transition could be put in evidence by studying how @xmath85 when @xmath20 decreases ; a liquid - glass transition could be taking place at the lowest values of @xmath25 or , eventually increasing @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> superdiffusion and large values of @xmath57 could be signaling such a transition . </S>",
    "<S> another promising line of investigation is _ active _ mesorheology , i.e. probing the response of the system to the application of an external force , achieved by coupling a controllable motor to the blade  @xcite .    </S>",
