    "transition metal dichalchogenides have been studied for many years in an effort to understand their diverse properties @xcite .",
    "these materials are layered quasi - two dimensional systems that frequently exhibit charge density wave ( cdw ) ordering that is not yet fully understood @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the crystal structure of these materials is amenable to substitution and intercalation of a wide variety of dopant atoms to allow tuning through a broad range of electronic properties @xcite . in particular , these systems provide a valuable avenue to study the interplay of structural transitions and superconductivity as in many cases superconductivity emerges after the cdw transition is suppressed by doping or applied pressure @xcite .",
    "irte@xmath3 is a member of this group of compounds .",
    "it undergoes a structural transition at about 270  k @xcite from the trigonal p@xmath4m1 space group to triclinic p@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that this structural transition is associated with a charge density wave that has a periodicity 6 times larger than the underlying lattice @xcite .",
    "substituting ir with pd , pt , or rh @xcite or intercalation with cu @xcite suppresses the structural transition and leads to superconductivity with a maximum @xmath6 of 3  k and @xmath7 0.1  t. intercalation with other transition metals also suppresses the structural transition but does not lead to superconductivity , possibly as a result of competing magnetism @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath6 as a function of hydrostatic pressure in pt - substituted irte@xmath3 have shown that increasing the temperature of the structural transition decreases @xmath6 , which shows that the appearance of superconductivity is directly related to the disappearance of the structural transition @xcite .",
    "irte@xmath3 is of particular interest as both ir and te have high atomic numbers .",
    "spin orbit coupling is therefore expected to be high which may lead to exotic states such as topological superconductivity @xcite .",
    "determining the superconducting symmetry is important as unconventional ( non s - wave ) symmetry is required for superconductors to be topologically nontrivial @xcite .",
    "previous measurements of the superconducting symmetry by thermal conductivity @xcite and stm @xcite suggest conventional s - wave superconductivity .",
    "however , the thermal conductivity measurements can not conclusively rule out odd - parity p - wave superconductivity , and stm measurements are inherently a surface technique and so the state they probe may not be representative of the bulk superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , no penetration depth measurements have been conducted on this material .",
    "these measurements are important , as the temperature dependence of the penetration depth gives information about the symmetry of the superconducting gap @xcite .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) is a powerful technique that can be used to study the magnetic penetration depth of type ii superconductors in the vortex state @xcite . in this technique",
    "spin - polarized muons are implanted up to a few hundred @xmath0 m into the sample where they precess in the local magnetic field and decay , emitting positrons that are detected to gain information about the local magnetic field .",
    "importantly , the muons are implanted far enough into the sample that this can be considered a truly bulk technique .",
    "therefore , surface effects that may change the states measured by techniques such as stm will not be a factor in these measurements .",
    "in this paper we present complementary @xmath0sr and squid magnetometry measurements of the penetration depth of ir@xmath1pt@xmath2te@xmath3 .",
    "these measurements indicate an s - wave superconducting state , with gap and @xmath6 values that are consistent with a conventional bcs weak - coupling superconductor .",
    "single crystals of ir@xmath1pt@xmath2te@xmath3 with sizes of a couple mm@xmath8 were grown using the self flux growth method @xcite .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) experiments were performed at the triumf laboratory in vancouver , canada .",
    "we used the pandora dilution refrigerator spectrometer on the m15 surface - muon beam line .",
    "this instrument gives access to temperatures between 0.03  k and 10  k with the sample mounted on a silver cold finger , magnetic fields up to 5  t with a superconducting magnet , and a time resolution of 0.4  ns .",
    "the field is applied parallel to the incoming muon beam direction , and we performed measurements with the muon spin rotated perpendicular to the field direction ( sr ) .",
    "these experiments were performed on an unaligned collection of small ( < 1 - 2 mm ) irregularly shaped single crystals mounted on a 1 x 2  cm silver plate using apiezon n - grease .",
    "we used the @xmath0srfit software package to analyze the @xmath0sr data @xcite    magnetometry measurements were performed at mcmaster university using a quantum design xl-5 mpms with an ihelium he@xmath8 cryostat insert for measurements down to 0.5  k. magnetization vs. temperature curves were measured both on a subset of unaligned crystals from the @xmath0sr sample weighing 238  mg ( polycrystalline sample ) , and on an aligned single crystal plate weighing 4.72  mg with dimensions 2.4  mm x 1.5  mm x 0.35  mm ( c - axis ) .",
    "magnetization vs. field curves were measured with fields up to 0.15  t and temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 3  k using the single crystal plate .",
    "alignment of the single crystal was verified with laue x - ray diffraction prior to the magnetometry measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : polymvt ] shows a temperature scan of the magnetization taken with an applied field of 300  oe after cooling in zero field on the polycrystalline sample for comparison with the @xmath0sr data .",

    "this data shows a relaxing oscillating signal , with a beat evident in the lower temperatures along with a non - relaxing signal that persists to large times .",

    "[ fig : tfspectra ]  ( d ) .",

    "[ fig : scmvt ] ( b ) is significantly larger than 50  g because demagnetization effects increase the effective internal field .",
    "we accounted for this in the rest of the analysis by approximating our sample as a rectangular prism of dimensions 2.4  mm x 1.5  mm x 0.35  mm .",
    "this gives a demagnetization factor of @xmath42 for the field applied parallel to the c - axis , and @xmath43 for the field applied perpendicular to the c - axis , using the formula found in ref .",

    "the magnetization of a type ii superconductor in the reversible regime near @xmath46 can be approximated using the london model as @xcite ,    @xmath47    here , @xmath48 is the magnetization in g , @xmath49 is the flux quantum , @xmath50 is the effective zero field penetration depth , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are constants which depend on the field range being fit .",
    "we therefore plotted @xmath48 vs. @xmath53 , and fit the resulting linear regime to determine @xmath50 from the slope ( @xmath54 ) as ,    @xmath55    we used an @xmath51 value of 0.7 in the following analysis , appropriate to higher field ranges @xcite .",

    "the low temperature penetration depth measured by @xmath0sr ( 120  nm ) falls between these two values , which is expected as the polycrystalline @xmath0sr sample should result in an averaging of the two penetration depths .",
    "the @xmath0sr value is closer to the @xmath58 value , which may indicate some preferential orientation of the polycrystalline sample .",
    "however , as the @xmath0sr data is measured at 300  oe , we would also expect it to have a slightly larger penetration depth compared to the effective zero field values from the magnetization fitting .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the @xmath0sr value is above the average of the two zero - field values , and we can say that penetration depths measured by our two different techniques seem broadly consistent , giving a true zero field average penetration depth close to 100  nm .    from the penetration depth , we determined the normalized superfluid density , @xmath59 , in each case as ,    @xmath60    the resultant superfluid densities are plotted in fig .",

    "the likely explanation is that there is some variation between individual crystal grains , and that the one we used for the single - crystal measurements has a slightly lower @xmath6 compared to the polycrystalline aggregate used for the @xmath0sr measurements .    to determine whether our data matches what would be expected of a fully gapped superconductor , we fit these superfluid densities to the formula @xcite ,    @xmath64",
