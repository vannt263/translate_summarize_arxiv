    "the one dimensional systems , with a time independent hamiltonian , are treated in a rather different way in classical and quantum mechanics . in quantum mechanics",
    "the schrdinger equation for such systems determines the spectrum that can include a discrete part for bound states and a continuous sector for unbounded ( scattering ) states . for periodic potentials there",
    "are forbidden and allowed bands of energy whose borders constitute the spectrum in a wider sense . only in some cases the eigenvalue problem for the stationary schrdinger equation can be solved `` exactly '' so that we are able to find a `` closed expression '' for the spectrum ( energy eigenvalues ) as well as for the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "this situation arises ( but it is not the only option ) when there are lowering and raising operators that close a spectrum generating algebra with the hamiltonian and factorize the casimir of the algebra up to a constant @xcite .    from the point of view of classical mechanics ,",
    "the hamiltonians of one dimensional conservative systems are integrals of motion , hence all these systems are maximally integrable @xcite .",
    "this property , in classical mechanics , implies that every closed and bounded trajectory must be periodic .",
    "for this reason , often they are considered almost trivial and usually have not received much attention @xcite .",
    "the values of the energy are continuous for both , bound and unbounded motion states .",
    "while the motion is necessarily periodic with a certain frequency ( in general depending on the energy ) for bound states , it is non - periodic for the unbounded ones . in some special cases , we can find the explicit expression for the motion in the phase space by means of the algebraic structure underlying these classical systems .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to show how this structure is presented for a class of one dimensional classical systems .",
    "the hamiltonians that allow for this treatment are classical analogues of some quantum systems .",
    "we will see that the algebraic structure of these quantum and classical systems are similar , but at the same time there are important differences .",
    "therefore , the general motivation of this work is to close the symmetry considerations of both , classical and quantum mechanics in this framework .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our algebraic approach to the classical systems in terms of poisson algebras @xcite . for the factorizable classical systems",
    "we find two time - dependent integrals of motion similar to the bohlin invariants @xcite .",
    "these invariants allow us to obtain algebraically the solutions of motion that give rise to trajectories in the phase space .",
    "usually , the time - independent integrals of motion have been used to simplify the differential equation of motion in order to get explicit solutions , but the time - dependent integrals of motion have been hardly used in studying stationary systems .",
    "this work is one step forward in the applications of such a type of invariants .",
    "this development is systematically applied to some examples in sections 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "we will end the paper with some comments and conclusions on the results here obtained .",

    "we will investigate a kind of factorization of the hamiltonian @xmath10 in terms of two complex - conjugate functions @xmath11 as @xmath12 here the term @xmath13 , contrary to the usual factorizations in quantum mechanics , may depend on @xmath10 . in the case of bound states with positive energy ( @xmath14 )",

    "it is clear that a global constant factor in the functions @xmath20 will produce an equivalent factorization so that in the following we will choose this factor to get simpler expressions .",
    "we will ask the functions , @xmath11 and @xmath10 , to define a deformed algebra with the poisson brackets @xcite as follows @xmath21 @xmath22 the auxiliary functions @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath19 will be expressed in terms of the powers of @xmath25 . in the case of bound motions with negative energy we must replace the square roots @xmath25 by @xmath26 in the above construction",
    ". there are systems that can allow for bound and unbounded motions , in such cases the complex character of the factors @xmath11 can change in each energy sector , as well as the deformed algebra .",

    "we conclude that @xmath28 will depend only on @xmath10 and therefore , we can express this dependence as in ( [ hh ] ) . to show ( [ aa ] ) , we start from the jacobi identity @xmath29 substituting on the r.h.s of this identity relation ( [ ha ] ) , we find @xmath30 so that the bracket @xmath31 can be expressed in the form ( [ aa ] ) .    now , for a system allowing for this kind of factorization",
    ", we can construct two time - dependent integrals of motion , @xmath32 it is easy to check that the total time derivative of @xmath33 is equal to zero : @xmath34 since the nonzero partial time derivative is compensated by the poisson bracket of the integral of motion with the hamiltonian by using relation ( [ ha ] ) .",

    "the two independent integrals @xmath42 allow us to find algebraically the trajectories ( @xmath43 ) in the phase space .",
    "in particular , we can appreciate from ( [ q ] ) that the frequencies of the motion for bound states are given by @xmath44 .",
    "if we substitute @xmath45 and @xmath20 given by ( [ a ] ) in ( [ ha ] ) we get two relations for the unknown functions @xmath17 , @xmath16 , @xmath23 , @xmath19 , @xmath18 and @xmath8 : @xmath46 -2f'(x)(h - v(x))+f(x)\\,v'(x)=\\alpha(h)\\left(\\sqrt{h}\\,g(x)+\\phi(h)+\\varphi(x)\\right ) % \\label{fv } \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the corresponding argument of each function .",
