    "although the quantum field theory has succeeded in many areas of modern physics , people have met some difficulties when the quantum field theory is applied to nuclear systems .",
    "firstly , nuclear matter and all nucleus are many - body systems , and their ground states are states where the fermi sea is filled with interacting nucleons , not the `` vacuum . ''",
    "secondly , the nucleons are extended objects , but they are treated as `` points '' in the quantum field theory .",
    "these approximations might cause some troubles in the research of nuclear physics .",
    "thus people have tried to exclude the whole volume ocuppied by nucleons from their configuration space , then consider nucleons as `` point - like '' particles moving in the mean field @xcite . since the nucleon volume is not relativistic invariant , in ref@xcite a relativistic consistent volume effect of nucleons is included in their calculation of the properties of nuclear matter.however , all the previous methods of treating the finite volume effects are mainly from the consideration of the geometry of the participating particles .    now in this paper , we incorporate the excluded volume effect into the lagrangian density of nuclear matter . since the volume of nucleons is about @xmath0 of the space in the saturation nuclear matter , we regard the excluded volume effect as a perturbation and the first order self - energy is calculated in the framework of relativistic mean - field approximation . at last , a set of parameters is obtained so that the saturation properties of nuclear matter can be reproduced well .",
    "to take into account of the excluded volume effect , the whole volume of nucleons @xmath1 is substracted from the volume of nuclear matter @xmath2 so that the effective space available for nucleon motion is @xmath3,where @xmath4 is the volume of a nucleon , @xmath5 is the total number of nucleons in the nuclear matter .",
    "the nucleons in nuclear matter are constantly moving , constrainted by pauli principle .",
    "thus the length of each nucleon decreases in the direction of its movement by the lorentz contraction and the effective space for nucleons is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the scalar density of nucleons .",
    "the box normalization factor becomes @xmath8 and the corresponding field is written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the nucleon field in the effective space @xmath11 . from now on ,",
    "we use the quantities with @xmath12 for the ones in the original space and the quantities without @xmath12 for the quantities in the effective space.the relation between the scalar densities of nucleons in the two spaces is @xmath13 from the eq.@xmath14,we obtain @xmath15 if the @xmath16 terms and beyond are neglected , the above equation becomes @xmath17    since @xmath7 and @xmath18 are the scalar density operators of nucleons in the original space and the effective space respectively , namely @xmath19 ,  @xmath20 , then we can obtain @xmath21 that is to say , when the volume of nucleons is excluded , the field operators in the lagrangian should be changed in the following way @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an operator , such as 1 , @xmath24 etc .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian is written as @xmath25 where @xmath26    the lagrangian in the relativistic mean - field approximation is @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the expectation values of meson fields in the ground states of nuclear matter .",
    "since the radius of a nucleon in nuclear matter is usually taken as 0.63fm , the whole volume of nucleons is only about @xmath0 of the volume of the saturated nuclear matter so that the effect of nucleon volume can be treated as a perturbation .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath30 can be divided into nonperturbative and perturbative parts , e.g. @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the interaction picture defined by the nonperturbative lagrangian density @xmath34 .",
    "the equation of motion for the nucleon field can be easily obtained from @xmath34 : @xmath35    the perturbative hamilton in the interaction picture is @xmath36 where @xmath37 . the first order of the evolution operator @xmath38 is @xmath39 when the effect of nucleon volume is considered , the corresponding green function is @xmath40 after some straightforward derivation the first order self - energy of nucleon can be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 with @xmath45 . in the first order approximation , the green function reads as @xmath46 with @xmath47 this green function can be rewritten as following @xmath48 namely , @xmath49 in which @xmath50 now we can see that the perturbation interaction causes the corrections of mass , energy and wave function of the nucleon . which are expressed by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the effective mass @xmath54 and energy of a nucleon @xmath55 should be changed as @xmath56 @xmath57 the scalar density @xmath18 and vector density @xmath58 of nucleons are @xmath59 @xmath60    we must calculate the effective mass @xmath54 of nucleons self - consistently : @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 and @xmath65 from the equations @xmath66 and @xmath67 the values of @xmath28 and @xmath29 are calculated . at",
    "last we acquire the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter @xmath68 where @xmath69",
    "in our calculation the radius of the nucleon in the nuclear matter is taken as @xmath70 and the four parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 in this model are fixed by fitting the saturation properties of normal nuclear matter .",
    "the parameters in this model(labeled by itp)are listed in table 1 . as a comparison , the parameter set nl3 , which is often used in the rmf calculation with all the nucleons taken as point - like particles@xcite , and qrz set , which is obtained in ref@xcite by including the finite volume effect from the geomitry consideration ,",
    "are also given in the table 1 .",
    "comparing with the nl3 set , the coupling constant to scalar mesons @xmath75 of itp becomes lager .since the excluded volume effect actually supplies a repulsive force , so this trend is reasonable .",
    "for the coupling constant to vector mesons @xmath76 which is associated with the repulsive interaction between nucleons , its itp value is smaller than the one of nl3 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of qrz set .    with different set of parameter",
    ", the average energy per nucleon as a function of the number density for nuclear matter is shown in fig.1 . comparing these results",
    ", we can see that the average energy per nucleon of our calculation increases more quickly than those of nl3@xcite and qrz@xcite as @xmath77 although the values of compression modulus are almost the same at the saturation density .",
    "it manifests that the influence of the excluded volume effect of nucleons increases at higher density .",
    "the results at even higher densities , are not given in the figure since we are not sure if the purturbative model used in this paper is still suitable to calculate the equation of state at those densities .",
    "the effective nucleon mass @xmath78 as a function of the nucleon density @xmath79 for nuclear matter with different set of parameters is displayed in fig.2 .",
    "it decreases as the number density of nucleons increases .",
    "however , a little larger effective nucleon mass is obtained in our model than the result of the relativistic mean - field approximation where the nucleon is treated as `` point - like '' particles with nl3 parameters but the change is not so significant as indicated by qrz curve .",
    "the differences between the three models become larger as the density increases.this implies that at higher densities we have not only to take into account of the finite volume effect of nucleons but also have to pay attention to choose a `` better '' model to deal with it .",
    "in summary , we give a lagrangian density including the effect of volume of nucleons , then the first order self - energy of the nucleon is derived , and the equation of state of nuclear matter is calculated in the framework of relativistic mean - field approximation .",
    "our results indicate that the finite volume can cause a considerable influence on some properties of the nuclear matter .",
