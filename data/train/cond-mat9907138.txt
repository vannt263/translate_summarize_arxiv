    "the crossover from bcs superconductors to a bose - einstein condensate of tightly bound fermion pairs was first studied many years ago in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite in a model with @xmath3-function attraction .",
    "this crossover has recently raised renewed interest @xcite- @xcite , especially after the doping dependence of the critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) and non - fermi - liquid behavior above @xmath1 were combined in a phenomenological discussion of high-@xmath1 cuprates @xcite , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed study of the crossover based on a nonperturbative procedure in which derivative expansion is used to set up an effective xy - model whose well - known nonperturbative properties render information on the entire crossover regime of the above model .    physically , the most important distinctions between conventional ( bcs ) and strong - coupling ( bose - einstein ) regime lies in the fact that in the former only a small fraction of the conduction electrons is paired with the superfluid density involving all pairs , whereas in the latter practically all carriers are paired below a certain temperature @xmath4 , although not condensed .",
    "the temperature has to be lowered further below some critical temperature @xmath5 to make these pairs condensed and establish phase coherence , which leads to superconductive behavior .    in the model to be investigated in this paper , the crossover from bcs - type to bose - type superconductivity",
    "will take place either by varying the coupling strength , or by decreasing the carrier density .",
    "since in the bcs theory pair coupling is weak , it can well be described by mean - field theory for the pair fields . in the opposite limit of strong pair binding , on the other hand , superconductivity set in as a macroscopic occupationis of @xmath6 level and we are obliged to go beyond mean field level to describe such an effect . in three dimensions ,",
    "crossover from bcs superconductivity to the bose - einstein condensation of tightly bound fermion pairs was first investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite by summing particle - particle ladder diagrams which correspond to gaussian fluctuations around the mean field , in the functional integral formalism it was studied in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in both papers ,",
    "fluctuation corrections were retained in the number equation which was solved together with mean - field gap equation . in these papers , starting from fermionic system , gas of electron pairs was maped in the strong - coupling limit to the ideal bose gas and critical temperature was shown to becomes asymptoticaly temperature of bose - einstein condensation of ideal bose gas of particles with mass @xmath7 and density @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fermion mass and density . in this aproximation @xmath1 has an arificial maximum at intermediate coupling strength thus approaching limiting value in the strong - coupling limit from above .",
    "this artifact was removed in the generalized self - consistent green s function numerical approach in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall study the properties of collective modes with help of the lowest gradient terms governing the gaussian fluctuations around the mean - field solution .",
    "these are most violent in the phase of the order parameter .",
    "phase transitions in a system with these fluctuations are well understood in two and three dimensions from extensive studies of the xy - model . by setting up an equivalent xy - model we are therefore able to describe well the onset and disappearance of superconductivity in the entire crossover regime . in this way",
    ", we shall obtain simple formulas for the critical temperature @xmath1 as a monotonously increasing function of the coupling strength and carrier density in both two and three dimensions . in the weak - coupling limit",
    ", we give simple explicit formulas which show how the temperature of the @xmath2-model transition converges to the transition temperature in the bcs theory .",
    "the weak- to strong - coupling superconductivity crossover in two dimensions was studied via the kosterlitz - thouless theory in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was investigated within the same model as ours at a fixed carrier density , but only numerically and @xmath4 in the weak - coupling region is missing - the effect that we show analyticaly in our paper . ] .",
    "the different properties of size and phase fluctuations was also exploited in ref . @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model is the typical bcs hamiltonian in @xmath11 dimensions ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the fermi field operator , @xmath15 denotes the spin components , @xmath9 is the effective fermionic mass , and @xmath16 the strength of an attractive potential @xmath17 .",
    "the mean - field equations for the gap parameter @xmath18 and the chemical potential @xmath19 are obtained in the standard way ( see for example @xcite ) :    @xmath20    where the sum runs over all wave vectors @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the total number of fermions , @xmath23 the volume of the system , and @xmath24 are the energies of single - particle excitations .",
    "the @xmath3-function potential produces an artificial divergence and requires regularization .",
    "a bcs superconductor possesses a natural cutoff supplied by the debye frequency @xmath25 . for the crossover problem to be treated here",
    "this is no longer a useful quantity , since in the strong - coupling limit all fermions participate in the interaction , not only those in a thin shell of width @xmath25 around the fermi surface . to be applicable in this regime ,",
    "we renormalize the gap equation in three dimensions with the help of the experimentally observable @xmath26-wave scattering length @xmath27 , for which the low - energy limit of the two - body scattering process gives an equally divergent expression @xcite@xcite : @xmath28 eliminating @xmath29 from ( [ 1.4 ] ) and ( [ 1.1 ] ) we obtain a renormalized gap equation @xmath30 ,          \\label{1.5}\\ ] ] in which @xmath31 plays the role of a dimensionless coupling constant which monotonically increases from @xmath32 to @xmath33 as the bare coupling constant @xmath34 runs from small ( bcs limit ) to large values ( be limit ) .",
    "this equation is to be solved simultaneously with ( [ 1.2 ] ) .",
    "these mean - field equations were first analyzed at a fixed carrier density in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we shall first reproduce some of the obtained estimates for @xmath4 and @xmath19 .    in the bcs limit",
    ", the chemical potential @xmath35 does not differ much from the fermi energy @xmath36 , whereas with increasing interaction strength , the distribution function @xmath37 broadens and @xmath35 decreases . in the be limit",
    "we have tightly bound pairs and nondegenerate fermions with a large negative chemical potential @xmath38 . in the strong coupling limit eq .",
    "( [ 1.5 ] ) provide us an estimation for @xmath4 - characteristic temperature of the thermal pair breaking @xcite , whereas eq .",

    "( [ 1.2 ] ) we obtain that in the be limit @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the binding energy of the bound pairs . in the be limit , we can estimate that the pseudogap sets in at @xmath41 . a simple `` chemical '' equilibrium estimate @xmath42 yields for the temperature of pair dissociation : @xmath43 which shows at strong couplings @xmath4 is indeed related to pair formation @xcite , @xcite ( which in the strong - coupling regime lies above the temperature of the onset of phase coherence @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the gap in the spectrum of single - particle excitations has a special feature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite when the chemical potential changes its sign .",
    "the sign change occurs at the minimum of the bogoliubov quasiparticle energy @xmath44 where this energy defines the gap energy in the quasiparticle spectrum : @xmath45 thus , for positive chemical potential , the gap energy is given directly by the gap function @xmath46 , whereas for negative chemical potential , it is larger than that : @xmath47    in two dimensions , a nonzero bound state energy @xmath48 exists for any coupling strength .",
    "the cutoff can therefore be eliminated by subtracting from the two - dimensional zero - temperature gap equation @xcite-@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 the bound - state equation @xmath52 after performing the elementary integrals , one finds : @xmath53 in the next sectioins we will work at finite tempetrature , in doing so , we do not fix the carrier density but assume the presence of a reservoir which provides us with a temperature - independent chemical potential @xmath54 .",
    "such a fixed @xmath19 will be most convenient for deriving simple analytic results for the finite - temperature behavior of the system . in this fixed @xmath19 model carrier density",
    "becomes temperature dependent . for experimental measurements of @xmath19",
    "in this section we make use of derivative expansion to determine the relevant stiffness parameter for the study of phase fluctuations , which in two dimensions determines the temperature of the kosterlitz - thouless transition . in two - dimensional system ,",
    "the phase fluctuations are most violent causing the strongest modifications of the mean - field properties .",
    "the coleman - mermin - wagner - hohenberg theorem @xcite forbids the existence of a strict long - range order , but there is quasi - long - range order manifesting itself in a power behavior of the correlation functions at all temperatures below @xmath55 .",
    "we shall neglect the coupling to the magnetic vector potential throughout the upcoming discussion , so that the phase coherence below @xmath1 can be of long or quasi - long range , unspoiled by the meissner effect which would reduce the range to a finite penetration depth .",
    "the effective hamiltonian from which we deduce the stiffness of the phase fluctuations was derived in @xcite , @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize a few important aspects of it , with a reminder of its derivation given below . writing the spacetime - dependent order parameter as @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the four - vector @xmath58 formed from imaginary time and position vector , the partition function",

    "clearly , kosterlitz - thouless transition always take place below @xmath4 . for vortices of a high fugacity",
    ", the temperature of the phase transition is determined by the well - known formula @xcite @xmath81 which follows from the divergence of the average square size of a vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "since these attract each other by a coulomb potential @xmath82 , the average square distance is @xmath83 which diverges indeed at the temperature ( [ kt ] ) . in our case",
    "@xmath55 should be determined self - consistently : @xmath84 from ( [ bk9 ] ) , ( [ 1.2 ] ) and ( [ kt ] ) it is easily seen that @xmath85 indeed tends to zero when the pair attraction vanishes in which case @xmath86 . in general , the behavior of @xmath85 for strong and weak couplings is found by the following considerations .",
    "we observe that the particle number @xmath10 does not vary appreciably in these limits with temperature in the range @xmath87 , so that weak - coupling estimates for @xmath85 derived within the model with temperature - independent chemical potential ( i.e. , when the system is coupled to a large reservoir ) practically coincide with those derived from a fixed fermion density .",
    "further it is immediately realized that in the weak - coupling limit @xmath88 is a small parameter . at zero coupling ,",
