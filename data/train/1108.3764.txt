    "diphoton final states represent a very important testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) , for example they may be one of the main discovery channels for the higgs boson searches at the cern lhc .",
    "moreover , similar to the case of dileptons , the inclusive production of two - photon high mass resonance states at the lhc : @xmath2 is considered as a powerful , clean test of new physics ( np ) , would an excess of @xmath3 events be observed with respect to the prediction from the sm cross section",
    ".    one np scenario of particular importance is the case of the spin-2 kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton excitations predicted by the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model of gravity in one warped spatial extra dimension  @xcite .",
    "this model suggests a rich phenomenology that includes the production of diphoton resonances , to be explored at collider energies , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . the existence of such graviton excitations can be signalled by the occurrence of peaks in the invariant mass distribution of the photon pairs and , indeed , the lowest lying predicted diphoton peak has recently been searched for in experiments at the @xmath4 fermilab tevatron collider @xcite , and at the 7 tev @xmath5 lhc collider with time - integrated luminosity of the order of 40 @xmath6 @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "exclusion mass limits on the lightest rs resonance of the tev order have been set , and graviton mass scales larger than 1 tev will certainly be in the kinematical reach of lhc .    assuming that a diphoton peak at an invariant mass value @xmath7 is observed , its association to a specific np scenario would be possible only if we are able to discard other competitor models , potential sources of the peak itself with same @xmath7 and same number of events .",
    "basically , for any nonstandard model one can define , on the basis of the foreseeable statistics and uncertainties , a _ discovery reach _ on the relevant heavy resonance @xmath8 as the upper limit of the range in @xmath7 where , in a specific domain of the model parameters called `` signature space '' , the peak is expected to give a signal observable over the sm prediction to a prescribed confidence level . instead ,",
    "the _ identification reach _ on the model is the upper limit of the range in @xmath7 where it can be identified as the source of the peak , once discovered , or , equivalently , the other competitor models can be excluded for all values of their respective parameters . of course ,",
    "for many models , identification should be possible only in a subdomain of their signature space .",
    "the determination of the spin of an observed resonance clearly represents an important selection among different classes of nonstandard interactions . in the case of the inclusive diphoton production ( [ proc ] ) ,",
    "the tool to directly test the spin-2 of the rs graviton resonance or , equivalently , exclude the hypothesis of a spin-0 scalar particle exchange , would be provided by the distinctive angular distributions in the angle @xmath9 between the incident quark or gluon and the final photon in the diphoton center - of - mass frame .",
    "this is similar to dilepton production , the difference being that in this case the hypotheses of both the spin-0 and the spin-1 exchanges must simultaneously be excluded .",
    "the spin-2 test of the lowest - lying rs graviton in lepton - pair collider events , through the direct comparison of the angular distributions for the various spin hypotheses , was earlier discussed in several papers , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , and experimental angular analysis were attempted at the tevatron in ref .",
    "a potential difficulty of the direct - fit angular analysis at the lhc is that generally , due to the symmetry of the proton - proton initial configuration , the determination on an event - by - event basis of the direction of the initial parton , hence of the sign of @xmath10 , is in principle not fully unambiguous , so that cuts in phase space must be applied in this regard .    the spin-2 rs graviton analysis of lhc dilepton events proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , makes use of a `` center - edge '' angular asymmetry @xmath0 where the above mentioned ambiguity should not be present @xcite .",
    "essentially , in this observable the dilepton events are weighted according to the @xmath10 differential distributions , and the asymmetry is defined between cross sections symmetrically integrated over `` center '' and `` edge '' angular intervals .",
    "recently , asymmetries conceptually analogous to @xmath0 , have been applied to heavy quantum states spin identification in refs .",
    "@xcite , and a comparison of the performances of different methods for heavy resonances identification has been presented in ref .",
    "angular analyses for different spin - mediated drell - yan processes have been applied to a variety of np models in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    ", we propose the application of @xmath11 to the angular analysis of the diphoton production process ( [ proc ] ) at the lhc . as remarked previously , the selection of the spin-2 rs graviton amounts in practice to exclude the hypothesis of a spin-0 particle exchange with same mass @xmath7 and producing the same number of diphoton events .",
    "ideally , one advantage of the diphoton channel over dileptons can be represented by the doubled statistics expected in the former case @xcite .",
    "also , the automatic exclusion of the spin-1 hypothesis  @xcite , should in any case allow a simplification of the analysis from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "finally , the consideration of process ( [ proc ] ) , in addition to dilepton production , is needed for an exhaustive test of model  @xcite .    for our analysis",
    "we have used the calculations of the required differential cross sections to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in qcd , and this is essential at a hadron collider as the theoretical uncertainties get reduced when higher order corrections are included .",
    "furthermore , as a result of new interactions in a np model , there will be additional subprocesses that contribute at leading order ( lo ) itself ( e.g. , @xmath12 in the rs model ) and hence the signal can receive enhanced contributions due to the nlo corrections .",

    "finally , sec .",
    "vi contains some conclusive remarks .",
    "the total cross section for a heavy resonance discovery in the events ( [ proc ] ) at a diphoton invariant mass @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath16 where the rapidity of the individual photon @xmath17 and @xmath18 is chosen such that @xmath19 .",
    "resonance spin - diagnosis uses the comparison between the characteristic photon differential distributions for the two hypotheses for the resonance bump , @xmath20 spin-2 kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of the rs model graviton and @xmath21 a massive scalar : @xmath22 in eqs .",
    "( [ totcr ] ) and ( [ diffcr ] ) , cuts on the phase space accounting for detector acceptance are implicit , and @xmath23 is an invariant mass bin around @xmath7 , which should somehow reflect the detector energy resolution and be sufficiently large as to include the resonance width . in",
    "the calculations worked out in the sequel , we use for this mass window the expression @xcite : @xmath24 actually , eq.([deltam ] ) was derived in connection to the atlas and cms experiments on dilepton production , but we assume it also for the calculations of diphoton production of interest here .",
    "obviously , for a resonance sufficiently narrow , the integral over @xmath25 should be practically insensitive to the size of @xmath23 , whereas it should be essentially proportional to @xmath23 for a flat background such as the sm .",
    "besides @xmath26 mentioned above , the assumed typical cuts on harder ( softer ) photons are @xmath27  gev , and the statistics will be estimated by taking a photon reconstruction efficiency @xmath28 .    moreover , to evaluate eqs .",
    "( [ totcr ] ) and ( [ diffcr ] ) , the partonic cross sections will be convoluted with the cteq6l and cteq6 m parton distributions sets for lo and nlo cross sections , respectively , with @xmath29 gev @xcite . in particular , for resonance discovery , process ( [ proc ] ) must be observed with a number of events well - above the background from sm processes . specifically , denoting by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the numbers of signal and sm events in the @xmath32 invariant mass window , the statistical significance of a 5-@xmath33 signal would be ensured by the criterion that @xmath30 should be larger than max(@xmath34,@xmath35 ) .    the @xmath36-evenly - integrated center - edge angular asymmetry @xmath0 is defined as : @xmath37 \\frac{{\\rm d } \\sigma}{{\\rm d } z}\\ , { \\rm d } z.\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite , the `` optimal '' numerical value turned out to be @xmath41 , and we shall keep this value of @xmath42 here as well . one can notice that by definition @xmath0 is symmetric under @xmath43 , hence it is insensitive to the sign of @xmath36 .",
    "moreover , as being a ratio of integrated cross sections , an advantage of @xmath0 is that it should be less sensitive to theoretical systematic uncertainties , such as the uncertainties from different sets of parton distributions and from the particular choice of factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "we here sketch the models we are interested in , together with their features relevant to the resonance spin and the distinctive angular distributions for process ( [ proc ] ) .",
    "this model , originally proposed as a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem @xmath44 , consists of two 3-branes , and one compactified warped extra spatial dimension @xmath45 with exponential warp factor @xmath46 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath47 is the 5d curvature , assumed to be of the order of @xmath48 .",
    "the two branes are placed at orbifold fixed points , @xmath49 with positive tension called the planck brane and the second brane at @xmath50 with negative tension called the tev brane .",
    "the basic , simplifying , hypothesis is that the sm fields are localized on the tev brane , whereas gravity originates on the planck brane but is allowed to propagate everywhere in the 5d space .",
    "the consequence of this setup is the existence of kk modes of the graviton that can be exchanged in the interactions among sm particles in tev brane . owing to the exponentially suppressing warp factor , mass scales , in passing from the planck brane to the tev brane ,",
    "can get the size of the tev order .",
    "moreover , a specific mass spectrum of such kk resonances is predicted in terms of an effective mass scale defined as @xmath51 , that for @xmath52 happens to be of the tev order ( here , @xmath53 with @xmath54 the newton constant ) .",
    "these resonances , represented by spin-2 fields @xmath55 , can in process ( [ proc ] ) show up as ( narrow ) peaks in @xmath56 , through the interaction @xmath57 here : @xmath58 is the energy - momentum tensor of the sm ; the characteristic mass spectrum is @xmath59 ( with @xmath60 the roots of the bessel function @xmath61 ) ; and the resonance widths are @xmath62 , with @xmath63 a calculable constant depending on the number of open decay channels , of the order of @xmath64 .",
    "the model can therefore conveniently be parametrized in terms of @xmath65 , the mass of the lowest graviton excitation , and of the `` universal '' dimensionless graviton coupling @xmath66 .",

    "higher luminosity , and/or larger lhc energy , would be required to extend this region by the @xmath0 based angular analysis .",
    "finally , one may observe that the results regarding the rs graviton identification obtained in the previous section show that the inclusive diphoton process ( [ proc ] ) at the lhc is complementary to the drell - yan dilepton production , in the sense that only the scalar exchange needs be considered as a competitor , alternative , hypothesis for the source of resonance events .",

    "<S> the high mass neutral quantum states envisaged by theories of physics beyond the standard model can at the hadron colliders reveal themselves through their decay into a pair of photons . </S>",
    "<S> once such a peak in the diphoton invariant mass distribution is discovered , the determination of its spin through the distinctive photon angular distributions is needed in order to identify the associated nonstandard dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we here discuss the discrimination of the spin-2 randall - sundrum graviton excitation against the hypothesis of a spin-0 exchange giving the same number of events under the peak , by means of the angular analysis applied to resonant diphoton events expected to be observed at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> the spin-0 hypothesis is modelled by an effective interaction of a high mass gauge singlet scalar particle interacting with the standard model fields . </S>",
    "<S> the basic observable of our analysis is the symmetrically integrated angular asymmetry @xmath0 , calculated for both graviton and scalar @xmath1-channel exchanges to next - to - leading order in qcd .    </S>",
