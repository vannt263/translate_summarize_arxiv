    "in the history of particle and nuclear physics the study of weak interactions and especially beta decay has played a vital role .",
    "these studies helped , amongst others , to establish the v - a structure of weak interactions . nowadays , this interest is somewhat reduced but there are still interesting topics to investigate like the endpoint measurements of tritium and @xmath4re electron spectra to determine the neutrino mass @xcite or the search for s , t , v contributions to the weak interaction @xcite .",
    "in addition to these beyond the standard model searches , some interesting nuclear physics questions are still open like the study of highly forbidden beta decays . the major bulk of beta emissions",
    "are characterised as allowed or single forbidden , however there are a few isotopes which are at least 4-fold forbidden , having ft - values beyond 20 @xcite .",
    "these are extremely rare decays with half - lives well beyond @xmath5 years .",
    "it occurs that for 5-fold forbidden transitions ( like in @xmath6ca and @xmath7zr ) even double beta decay is more likely to occur .",
    "+ in this paper the focus is on 4-fold forbidden @xmath8-decays .",
    "there are only three nuclei in nature which permit a feasible study of four - fold forbidden beta decay , @xmath0cd , @xmath9v and @xmath10 in , all of them are non - unique ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "half - lives of these transitions are long ( @xmath12 years ) and in typical experiments would produce very low count rates , and as such can only be studied in well shielded , low radioactive background experiments . in this paper",
    "the focus is on the decay @xmath0cd ( 1/2@xmath13 in ( @xmath14 ) , with a q - value of 320 @xmath15 3 kev @xcite .",
    "+ the cobra collaboration is performing a search for neutrinoless double beta decay of which the half - life may be well above @xmath16 years @xcite .",
    "results from previous cobra experiments can be found in @xcite .",
    "the present cobra experiment , known as the 64-array @xcite , is formed of 64 1 @xmath17 cdznte semiconductor crystals , each with a mass of @xmath18 6.5 g .",
    "the experiment is shielded and situated underground in laboratori nationali del gran sasso ( lngs ) in italy . due to the cadmium content of the semi - conductor , this",
    "four - fold forbidden non - unique beta decay of @xmath0cd forms the dominant low energy feature .",
    "we present results from the first layer of this experiment comprising 16 crystals . measurements of the half - life of this decay and q - value have been made independently for 11 working and well - behaved crystals .",
    "+ there have been five previous attempts to measure the half - life of @xmath0cd .",
    "the first using a cdte device resulted in ( 4 - 12)@xmath19 10@xmath20 years @xcite .",
    "measurements using cdwo@xmath21 as a scintillator found 7.7@xmath150.3@xmath1910@xmath20 years @xcite and as a cryogenic bolometer obtained 9.0@xmath150.5(stat)@xmath151(sys)@xmath1910@xmath20 years @xcite .",
    "previously the cobra collaboration obtained 8.2@xmath150.2(stat)@xmath22(sys)@xmath1910@xmath20 years @xcite using room temperature cdznte semiconductor detectors . a very recent result using a cdwo@xmath21 scintillator measured 8.04@xmath150.05@xmath1910@xmath20 years @xcite .",
    "we present spectra from 11 detectors , with a total exposure of 6.58 kg days .",
    "measurements were performed with the first installed layer of the cobra 64-array , comprising sixteen 1 @xmath17 cdznte semiconductor detectors . the array is housed in an inner copper shield of 5 cm thickness , and surrounded by a lead castle of 20 cm thickness .",
    "+ the whole setup is enclosed in a faraday cage , which itself is surrounded by a neutron shield made out of 7 cm thick boron - loaded polyethylene plates and 20 cm of paraffin wax . the full experiment is situated in laboratori nationali del gran sasso ( lngs ) with 1400 m of rock shielding , corresponding to about 3500 metres water equivalent .",
    "+        the cdznte detectors were manufactured by ev - products @xcite , and are coplanar grid ( cpg ) devices@xcite with gold anode grids and cathode .",
    "detectors of this kind only read out the electron signal and their operational principle is analogous to a frisch grid in a wire chamber .",
    "the detectors are coated with a passivation paint to provide a highly resistive surface layer and to maintain longterm stability .",
    "the detectors are bonded to kapton signal and high voltage foils with a low activity copper loaded glue which was developed in - house .",
    "each crystal receives individually tailored high voltage , grid bias and weighting of the cpg subtraction circuit .",
    "these parameters are optimised to minimise the full width half maximum of the 1274.5 kev photopeak from a @xmath23na calibration source .",
    "the cpg guard rings are not contacted to maximise the active mass of each crystal , typically 6.5 g .",
    "each crystal has a slightly different mass , which are known having being weighed by the manufacturers prior to passivation ; table [ tab : resolutions - of - detectors2 ] . + all the cobra",
    "electronics have been designed and manufactured in - house .",
    "the cpg anode signals are processed by a 16-channel preamplifier based on the suggested circuit from ev - products .",
    "the resulting signals are shaped by cobra shaping amplifiers with time constants of 1@xmath24s , digitised by cobra four - channel 14-bit peak sensing adcs which are integrated into vme architecture .",
    "the manufacturer ( analog devices ) specifications of the 14-bit peak sensing adc chip , ad7865 @xcite , give a maximum dnl ( differential non - linearity ) of @xmath151lsb ( least significant bit ) .",
    "all adcs have a slight variation on the width of each adc code ( voltage range which results in a particular adc code ) and this can be observed in spectra with high numbers of counts , such that the poisson uncertainty is insignificant in comparison with the variation of each adc code width .",
    "the resulting effect on a spectrum is that neighbouring adc values appear to be statistically incompatible with each other .",
    "these effects are not confused for real spectral features since the former occur on a bin - by - bin basis , and spectral features are usually far wider .",
    "in some situations this effect can be considered as a systematic or indeed calibrated for . if , as in this case , spectra from different adcs or with different calibrations as with a long running experiment are summed energy - wise then the effect becomes statistical .",
    "it was found that an assumption of an uncertainty of 10% on each adc code was enough to bring neighbouring values into statistical agreement for the whole cobra dataset .",
    "all data - sets presented , therefore , have statistical uncertainties that include a 10% uncertainty on the bin - width . for low statistics data - sets , such as for double - beta decay studies ,",
    "the number of counts are too low to observe this effect and only the study of the @xmath0cd spectrum is affected .",
    "+ the cobra setup is regularly calibrated with @xmath23na ( 511 and 1274.5 kev photopeaks),@xmath25co ( 122.1 kev photopeak ) and @xmath26th ( 2614.5 kev photopeak ) sources . a linear relationship between energy and adc channels is found .",
    "independent confirmations of the external calibration are made by measuring photopeaks present in the combined low background spectrum .",
    "two prominent photopeaks are observed in the low background data , at 351.2@xmath150.9 kev and 606@xmath152 kev , these are identified as the 351.9 kev and a blend of 609.3 kev and 583 kev lines from the @xmath27u and @xmath28th chains .",
    "we take the uncertainty on the 351.9 kev line , 0.9 kev , as a representation of the systematic uncertainty of the energy calibration of the entire experiment .",
    "this peak is close to the @xmath0cd shoulder and is therefore a very relevant calibration point .",
    "it was observed through - out the entire duration of the experiment and so if any calibration drifts did occur it would be subject to the same bias as the data .",
    "the uncertainty on the peak position is slightly greater than the bin - width of the spectra , 0.7 kev , and is probably dominated by the number of counts observed , and therefore can be considered as a conservative estimate .",
    "+ the relationship between the energy resolution ( quantifiable in terms of full width half maximum ) and photopeak energy is found to closely follow the functional form @xmath29 , where a and b are fit parameters .",
    "table [ tab : resolutions - of - detectors2 ] shows these resolution equations determined for the operational detectors .",
    "runs were taken in units of 1 hr . hour - long runs were deemed abnormal and rejected from the analysis if the number of counts observed in that run did not conform to the overall observed mean count rate . if the probability of the count rate for each hour - long run being compatible with the mean count rate was lower than 1% then that run was rejected from the analysis .",
    "such runs on closer inspection showed rapid bursts of events , thought to be due to vibrations , micro - discharges on the high voltage cables and electronic effects .",

    "we have made the most numerous measurements of 4-fold forbidden beta decays in this case for @xmath0cd , using 11 independent cdznte detectors . each can have a unique ( and independent ) set of detector parameters such as energy resolution , mass and @xmath0cd content etc .",
    "this gives a clear cross - check on our estimate of total systematic uncertainty .",
    "figure [ fig : halflife_hist ] shows a histogram of the half - lives determined for each detector .",
    "the spread in these results must be consistent ( or at least smaller than ) the combination of the estimated total systematic uncertainty and the determined statistical errors .",
    "the total systematic uncertainty was estimated earlier in section [ systematics ] to be @xmath183% .",
    "+ the statistical uncertainties on each half - life are derived from the fits and are shown in table [ table : halflives2 ] .",
    "the weighted mean uncertainty is @xmath33 years which is 1.3% of the weighted mean half - life . assuming the systematic and statistical uncertainties are independent",
    ", we would therefore expect the distribution of the half - lives shown in figure [ fig : halflife_hist ] to have a standard deviation of @xmath183.3% . +",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : halflife_hist ] , all the half - life estimates cluster except for two results which are well separated from the rest of the data .",
    "these are from detectors 10 and 11 , which both show significant low energy features and displayed bad goodness - of - fit probabilities when fitted with the low energy threshold of 100 kev .",
    "if these two detectors are ignored then the remaining estimates give an overall half - life value of @xmath34 years .",
    "the total uncertainty found is therefore 4% of the mean value .",
    "this uncertainty is larger than our estimates , 3.3% , but not unreasonably so .",
    "it may indicate that we have underestimated one of our systematic errors .",
    "one clear possibility to explain this discrepancy could be the assumed spread in the cadmium content since we have as yet no independent measurements of the content of these detectors .",
    "+    the estimate of the q - value is dependent on the fitted function , and assuming the used functional form to be correct , is found to be 322.2@xmath150.3(stat)@xmath150.9(sys ) kev .",
    "interestingly the work of @xcite fails to fit a feasible q - value that is consistent with the table of isotopes value of 320 @xmath15 3 kev @xcite .",
    "+ encouraged by the results of @xcite for the first time microscopic models were explored to predict the half - life and spectral shapes of 4-fold forbidden non - unique beta decays @xcite .",
    "the measured spectrum of one of the detectors , our fitted spectrum and this theoretical calculation are shown in figure [ fig : jouni ] .",
    "the theoretical calculation assumed a q - value of 320 kev .",
    "the spectral shape we measure does not match well with the theoretical spectrum and instead agrees well with the 4-fold forbidden unique spectrum as shown by @xcite .",
    "this is an interesting result and will hopefully motivate some further investigation as to why the fit for a unique transition , normally only linked to one nuclear matrix element fits better than the actual non - unique calculation .",
    "cdznte semiconductor detectors were used to search for the rare decay of the 4-fold forbidden non - unique beta decay of @xmath0cd . for the first time a statistically relevant sample of half - life measurements",
    "have been obtained for such rare decays .",
    "we confirm that the parameterisation of @xcite is a good fit to our data above 100 kev .",
    "using this parameterisation we obtain an estimate of the q - value of the decay to be 322.2@xmath150.3(stat)@xmath150.9(sys ) kev . assuming the fit to the data is correct , the resultant half - life is @xmath1 years which is completely consistent with previous measurements . +",
    "future work will improve upon the background levels experienced by the experiment .",
    "short test runs with four lower background detectors ( with colourless passivation coatings ) have already been made .",
    "these new runs also featured a clean nitrogen flushing system which reduces significantly the radon level in the shielded setup .",
    "longer runs are required to improve on the current result .",
    "ideally a new long run with many colourless detectors would be done , allowing the same systematic cross - checking that has been done in this experiment . +",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : sub ] there are some unexplained background features below 100 kev that are present on most but not all of the detectors .",
    "future work will try to ascertain where this background comes from .",
    "+ applying mild cooling ( @xmath1810@xmath35c ) to the detectors whilst inside the shielded setup will also be explored .",
    "this will reduce the surface leakage current dramatically and therefore lower the energy threshold and improve the energy resolution @xcite .",
    "+ non - intrusive means of measuring the zinc content are already being explored e.g. photoluminescence and x - ray fluorescence techniques .",
    "however , these techniques must be applied to the crystals in use either before bonding or at the end of the science run .",
