    "consider a finite chain , say @xmath4 under the natural ordering and let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the full transformation semigroup and the semigroup of all partial transformations on @xmath7 , under the usual composition , respectively .",

    "this paper establishes bijections between certain types of lattice paths and certain subsemigroups of @xmath0 , the semigroup of all order - preserving partial transformations of @xmath7 .",
    "thus combinatorial problems of these lattice paths can be translated into combinatorial problems of these subsemigroups of @xmath0 , and vice - versa .",
    "+ various enumerative problems of an essentially combinatorial nature have been considered for certain classes of semigroups of transformations .",
    "for example , it is well known and indeed obvious that @xmath5 and @xmath6 have orders @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . only slightly less obvious",
    "are their number of idempotents given by @xmath18 the first usually attributed to tainiter @xcite is actually ex 2.2.2(a ) in clifford and preston @xcite .",
    "the second can be deduced easily via vagner s method of representing a partial transformation by a full transformation @xcite , which has been used to good effect by garba @xcite . the following list ( which is by no means exhaustive ) of papers and books @xcite each contains some interesting combinatorial results pertaining to semigroups of transformations .",
    "combinatorial properties of @xmath19 , the semigroup of all decreasing and order - preserving partial transformations of @xmath7 have been investigated recently by laradji and umar @xcite .",
    "one surprising outcome from @xcite is the discovery of many integer sequences that are not yet recorded or have just recently been recorded in sloane s encyclopaedia of integer sequences @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the approach in this paper is that it establishes a connection between the theories of lattice paths and partial transformations .",
    "+ in section 2 , we give the necessary definitions that we need in the paper as well as show that the semigroup @xmath19 of all decreasing and order - preserving partial transformations of @xmath7 , is a disjoint union of two subsemigroups of the same cardinality . in section 3",
    ", we establish a bijection between a set of certain lattice paths and @xmath19 .",
    "hence we obtain the order of @xmath19 as the large or double schrder number @xcite , and the order of the two subsemigroups as the small schrder number .",
    "we also discuss several consequences of this bijection . in section 4 ,",
    "we gather some remarks concerning the results of the paper and we also give an alternative proof of the result that set of all idempotents of @xmath19 is of cardinality @xmath20 .",
    "for standard terms and concepts in transformation semigroup theory see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we now recall some definitions and notations to be used in the paper .",
    "consider @xmath4 and let @xmath21 be a partial transformation .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath11 and @xmath22 , the _ domain _ and _ image set _ of @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the semigroup @xmath6 , of all partial transformations contains two important subsemigroups which have been studied recently .",
    "they are @xmath23 and @xmath0 the semigroups of all order - decreasing and respectively order - preserving partial transformations , ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "now let @xmath24 be the semigroup of all decreasing and order - preserving partial transformations of @xmath7 .",
    "next let @xmath25 be the set of all maps in @xmath19 all of whose domain does contain the element 1 .",
    "then evidently we have the following result .",
    "both @xmath26 and its set complement @xmath27 are subsemigroups of @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 .",
    "less evidently , we have    @xmath29 .",
    "define a map @xmath30 from @xmath26 into @xmath27 by @xmath31 where @xmath32 it is clear that @xmath30 is a bijection since @xmath33 for all @xmath34 in @xmath27 , and @xmath35 for all @xmath12 in @xmath26 .",
    "informally , we may argue as follows : to get @xmath27 from @xmath26 we delete 1 from @xmath11 ( for each @xmath36 ) , if @xmath37 ; otherwise we delete 1 from @xmath38 as well .",
    "conversely , to get @xmath26 from @xmath27 we extend each @xmath39 by defining @xmath35 and @xmath40 for all @xmath41 .",
    "our main objective in this section is to give an alternative proof for @xmath42 .",
    "we begin our investigation by considering lattice paths in the cartesian plane that start at @xmath1 , end at @xmath43 , contain no points above the line @xmath44 , and composed only of steps @xmath45 and @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we shall call such lattice paths _ type i _ , in this paper .",
    "the diagrams in figure 1 illustrate all such paths in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 squares , respectively .",
    "the total number of such paths is known to be the large or double schrder number @xmath51 , @xcite .    to establish a bijection between the set of type i paths ( in an @xmath52 square ) and the set of all decreasing and order - preserving partial transformations of @xmath7 , we first make the following observation :    1 .   in each lattice path from @xmath1",
    "to @xmath2 there are exactly same number of horizontal steps as there are vertical steps .",
    "to see this , we note that a horizontal step corresponds to the map @xmath53 , a vertical step corresponds to the map @xmath54 , and a diagonal step corresponds to the map @xmath55 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath56 and @xmath57 . now",
    "if a path starts from @xmath1 and ends at @xmath43 using only the above steps then each such path can be written as a product : @xmath58 , and so we have @xmath59 hence @xmath60 , which implies @xmath61 .",
    "next , we note that it is convenient ( in this section ) to express @xmath12 in @xmath62 ( with base set @xmath63 ) as @xmath64 where the @xmath65 s are distinct , but the @xmath66 s are not necessarily distinct .",
    "moreover , we may also assume that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus @xmath69 however , we refer to the sequence @xmath70 as the _ simage _ of @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath71 ( note that if all the @xmath66 s are distinct then @xmath72 coincides with @xmath73 , otherwise @xmath74 ) now to each vertical step from @xmath75 to @xmath76 in an arbitrary type i path ( in an @xmath52 square ) we put @xmath77 in @xmath78 , and to each horizontal step from @xmath75 to @xmath79 we put @xmath77 in @xmath80 .",
    "the domain is then arranged in a strictly increasing order while the simage is arranged in a nondecreasing order , and by virtue of ( ob1 ) this gives rise to a unique order - preserving map .",
    "two examples should make these ideas more clear .",
    "the path given in figure 2 implies @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "thus the associated order - preserving map is @xmath83 and the path given in figure 3 implies @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "thus the associated order - preserving map is @xmath86    moreover , the condition that type i paths never cross above the diagonal line @xmath44 , forces these associated order - preserving maps to be decreasing as well .",
    "in fact , at any level , a horizontal step will take us 1-unit away from the diagonal line @xmath44 , and a vertical step will take us 1-unit closer to the diagonal line @xmath44 .",
    "thus , since our target is the point @xmath2 on this diagonal line we must take vertical steps at higher levels to compensate for each horizontal step , and so a decreasing map results . finally , note that the unique all diagonal path corresponds to the empty map .",
    "hence we have shown that to every type i lattice path in an @xmath52 square there corresponds a unique partial order - preserving map .",
    "conversely , we show that every @xmath87 corresponds to a type i path in an @xmath52 square . for a given @xmath12 in @xmath62",
    "we first express it as in ( 3.1 ) and write @xmath88 for some @xmath89 in @xmath90 . to construct an associated type i path , first note",
    "that since , in general , there may be repetitions in @xmath80 , we shall consider it as consisting of blocks of subsequences , where an @xmath10-block consists only of @xmath10 in @xmath91 , repeated say @xmath92 times @xmath93 .",
    "thus we may write @xmath94 where @xmath95 .",
    "( note that @xmath96 next we label the horizontal rows of the @xmath97 square from the bottom to the top , starting from 0 to @xmath98 . now starting from @xmath99",
    "if @xmath100 take as many horizontal steps as the length of the @xmath101-block , otherwise take a diagonal step to the next level ( level 1 ) .",
    "note that the order - decreasing property guarantees that @xmath102 , however there is no guarantee that @xmath103 ( for @xmath104 , but this will not be of any disadvantage . in general , at level @xmath92 @xmath105 , check    1 .   if @xmath106 and @xmath107 , take as many horizontal steps as the length of the @xmath92-block followed by a vertical step to the next level ; 2 .   if @xmath106 and @xmath108 , take as many horizontal steps as the length of the @xmath92-block followed by a diagonal step to the next level ; 3 .   if @xmath109 , take a vertical or diagonal step to the next level depending on whether @xmath110 or @xmath111 , respectively .",
    "now since in ( i ) and ( ii ) we give priority to horizontal step(s ) over vertical and diagonal steps , it follows by the order - decreasing property that at level @xmath92 we must have had at least as many horizontal steps as there are vertical steps ( up to level @xmath112 .",
    "this in turn guarantees that our paths never overshoot to cross the diagonal line @xmath44 .",
    "moreover the bijection between @xmath11 and @xmath80 guarantees that our paths always end up at @xmath2 as required .",
    "an example would be quite appropriate .",
    "consider the map @xmath113 then @xmath114 now start from @xmath1 and take 3 horizontal steps , since the first block of @xmath80 is a 0-block of length 3 .",
    "we are still at level 0 , however , we take a vertical step to level 1 since @xmath115 . now since @xmath116 , we take a diagonal step to level 2 .",
    "next , since @xmath117 we take a vertical step to level 3 . then since @xmath118 we take a vertical step to level 4 .",
    "now we take 2 horizontal steps and then a diagonal step since @xmath119 .",
    "we are now at level 5 , from where we take a vertical step to level 6 since @xmath120 . finally , we take another vertical step to level 7 , since @xmath121 .",
    "thus we have the path indicated in figure 4 .",
    "we have now established the main result of this section :    [ thrm31 ] there is a one - one correspondence between the set of all decreasing and order - preserving partial transformations of an @xmath122-element chain and the set of all type i lattice paths in an @xmath52 square .",
    "an immediate consequence of theorem [ thrm31 ] is that it furnishes us with the order of @xmath42 .",
    "however , before we formally state this result we first deduce from pergola and sulanke @xcite and stanley @xcite that the large ( or double ) schrder number denoted by @xmath51 could be defined as @xmath123 moreover , @xmath51 satisfies the recurrence @xmath124 for @xmath125 , with initial conditions @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the ( small ) schrder number is usually denoted by @xmath128 and defined as @xmath129 and so it satisfies the same recurrence as @xmath51 .",

    "several consequences of this result will now be exhibited .",

    "further , we give a sequence of results which arise naturally in the semigroup context which ( with the exception of theorem [ thrm38 ] ) may not have been asked yet in lattice path theory .",

    "moreover , @xmath158 satisfies the recurrence @xmath163    the proof that there is a bijection between the set of ( unrestricted ) lattice paths in an @xmath97 square and the semigroup @xmath164 is for most part similar to the one given earlier between the set of restricted ( or type i ) lattice paths and the semigroup @xmath19 , since @xmath165 applies to all lattice paths .",
    "however , note that below the diagonal of the @xmath97 square a horizontal step takes us 1-unit away from the diagonal while a vertical step takes us 1-unit closer to the diagonal , but above the diagonal the reverse is the case . in either case ,",
    "the diagonal step is neutral in the sense that it neither takes us closer to nor away from the diagonal .",
    "moreover , in this case we need not worry about our lattice paths crossing the diagonal of the @xmath97 square , as our paths can now cross over several times if necessary . as in the above",
    "we exemplify how to construct a lattice path from a partial transformation , and vice - versa .",
    "the path in figure 5 implies @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",

    "however , while idempotents are natural elements to study in a semigroup , their corresponding paths do not seem to have a natural description .",
    "we would like to take this opportunity to give an alternative easier proof of the formula for @xmath187 , though quite admittedly not via lattice paths this time .",
