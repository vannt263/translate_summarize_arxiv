    "the theory of analysis on fractals , analogous to that theory on manifolds , has been being well developed .",
    "the pioneering work is the analytic construction of the laplacians , for a class of self - similar fractals that include the sierpinski gasket as a typical example , developed by kigami [ ki1-ki6 ] , in which the laplacians are defined as renormalized limits of graph laplacians .",
    "there are a lot of works in exploring some properties of these fractal laplacians that are natural analogs of those for the usual laplacian . for related works",
    "see [ bk , bst , dsv , gkqs , iprrs , kl , kss , l , mt , qs , rs , t1 , s1-s7 ] and references therein . especially , there were several works in creating a calculus on fractals[bssy , drs , ku , nsty , s5 , t2 ] .",
    "since the fractal laplacian acts as a differential operator with order greater than one , in analogy with the usual laplacians on manifolds which are of second order , it is natural to make clear what is the first order derivative or gradient .",
    "there are two approaches to find the gradient .",
    "one is to view the dirichlet form as an integral of the inner product of gradients , see [ ku2 , ki3 ] for some works on this approach .",
    "however , it seems that this could not give direct information for a pointwise gradient .",
    "the other is to find the pointwise gradient directly .",
    "a paper of teplyaev [ t2 ] has made a satisfactory definition of the gradient at the general points in fractals and obtained some properties . for the vertex points case , strichartz [ s5 ] starting from the normal derivative",
    ", introducing some other derivatives at a vertex point @xmath0 , together with which , he made up a ( local ) gradient @xmath1 .",
    "please see [ t2 ] to find a description of the relations in between these different definitions and results of kigami , kusuoka , teplyaev and strichartz .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to study the properties of strichartz s derivatives at vertex points on fractals .",
