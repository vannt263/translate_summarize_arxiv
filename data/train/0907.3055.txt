    "the recent renewal of interest in multiferroic materials led to discovery of many novel compounds where electric polarization is induced by ordered magnetic states with broken inversion symmetry.@xcite the electric polarization in multiferroics is very susceptible to changes in spin ordering produced by an applied magnetic field , which gives rise to dramatic effects such as the magnetically - induced polarization flops and colossal magnetocapacitance.@xcite magnetoelectric interactions also couple spin waves to polar phonon modes and make possible to excite magnons by an oscillating electric field of light , which gives rise to the so - called electromagnon peaks in photoabsorption.@xcite    electromagnons were recently observed in two groups of multiferroic orthorombic manganites , @xmath0mno@xmath1 ( @xmath0 = gd , tb , dy , eu@xmath2y@xmath3 ) and @xmath0mn@xmath4o@xmath5 ( @xmath0 = y , tb ) .",

    "these peaks seem to originate from the exchange striction , i.e. ionic shifts induced by changes in the heisenberg exchange energy when spins order or oscillate.@xcite this mechanism explains the experimentally observed polarization of electromagnons .",

    "[ ] it was shown that the magnitude of the spectral weight of the giant electromagnon peak in the spiral state of rare earth manganites is in good agreement with the large spontaneous polarization in the e - type antiferromagnetic state,@xcite which has not been reliably measured yet but is expected to exceed the polarization in the spiral state by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude.@xcite    from the fact that the mechanism that couples magnons to light in rare earth manganites is different from the coupling that induces the static polarization in these materials we can conclude that electromagnons can also be observed in non - multiferroic magnets . in this paper we focus on electromagnons in materials exhibiting a linear magnetoelectric effect , i.e. when an applied magnetic field , @xmath6 , induces an electric polarization , @xmath7 , proportional to the field , while an applied electric field , @xmath8 , induces a magnetization , @xmath9 .",

    "they appear when magnons , which can be excited by an oscillating magnetic field ( antiferromagnetic resonances ) , mix with polar phonons , which are coupled to an electric field .",
    "thus in materials showing a linear magnetoelectric effect , for each electromagnon peak there is an antiferromagnetic resonance with the same frequency .",

    "another manifestation of this instability is the fact that as the spin - lattice coupling approaches the critical value , the magnetoelectric constant @xmath76 tends to its upper bound equal the geometric mean of the dielectric and magnetic susceptibilities , @xmath83 , imposed by the requirement of stability with respect to applied electric and magnetic fields.@xcite",
    "to study the transition from the magnetoelectric state of the kagom magnet to the multiferroic state in more detail , we consider a simple microscopic model , in which positions of magnetic ions are fixed , while ligand ions are allowed to move .",
    "the spin - lattice coupling originates from the dependence of the exchange constants on displacements of ligand ions mediating the superexchange in the direction perpendicular to the straight line connecting two neighboring spins .",

    "thus , the electromagnon peak in kitpite should be much stronger than the antiferromagnetic resonance peak , which is also the case for rare earth manganites with a spiral ordering.@xcite    at @xmath109 , the magnetoelectric constant diverges and so do the dielectric and magnetic susceptibilities : @xmath110 since in our model there are two polar phonons coupled to a magnon with a given polarization ( one in the up - triangle and another in the down - triangle ) , the magnetoelectric constant comes close to its upper bound but does not reach it at @xmath111 : @xmath112_{g = 1 } \\approx 0.985.\\ ] ]    surprisingly , the softening of the @xmath33 magnon mode , which is not coupled to polar lattice distortions , occurs at a lower value @xmath113 . since @xmath114 ,",

    "we present the analytical and numerical study of the phase diagram of the kitpite layer for strong spin - lattice couplings . in particular ,",
    "we show that none of the continuous transitions involving magnon softening , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : softening ] , actually takes place , as the strong spin - lattice coupling makes the frustrated kagom magnet unstable towards a first - order magnetoelastic transition that relieves the frustration .",
    "this frustration - driven instability is similar to the one found in spinels , where a collinear ordering of spins appears together with a lattice deformation.@xcite we show that the transformation of a non - collinear magnetoelectric state into a collinear multiferroic state can involve two transitions and an intermediate phase , which is ferroelectric but not ferromagnetic .    to understand the origin of magnetoelastic instabilities at strong spin - lattice coupling , we first consider a single up - triangle and integrate out the lattice degrees of freedom , @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",

    "@xcite ab initio calculations suggest that in rare earth manganites the electronic mechanisms of magnetoelectric coupling are as important as the exchange striction.@xcite on the other hand , the increase of the spectral weight of the electromagnon peaks in @xmath0mno@xmath1 below the spiral ordering temperature occurs largely at the expense of the strength of the optical phonon peak at @xmath148@xmath149 , suggesting the dominant role of the spin - lattice coupling .",

    "we showed that the softening of these modes at a strong spin - lattice coupling results in the divergence of the magnetoelectric constant as well as of magnetic and dielectric susceptibilities , signaling the instability of the magnetoelectric state towards a multiferroic state with spontaneously generated @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "however , the detailed study of the phase diagram of this model revealed that the electromagnon softening does not actually take place , since the first - order transition to the collinear multiferroic state occurs at a lower value of the spin - lattice coupling .",

    "<S> we show that strong electromagnon peaks can be found in absorption spectra of non - collinear magnets exhibiting a linear magnetoelectric effect . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of these peaks coincide with the frequencies of antiferromagnetic resonances and the ratio of the spectral weights of the electromagnon and antiferromagnetic resonance is related to the ratio of the static magnetoelectric constant and magnetic susceptibility . using a kagom lattice antiferromagnet as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we show that frustration of spin ordering gives rise to magnetoelastic instabilities at strong spin - lattice coupling , which transform a non - collinear magnetoelectric spin state into a collinear multiferroic state with a spontaneous electric polarization and magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the kagom lattice antiferromagnet also shows a ferroelectric incommensurate - spiral phase , where polarization is induced by the exchange striction mechanism . </S>"
