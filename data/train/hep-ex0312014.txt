    "large polarization effects were found during last few decades .",
    "ssa was observed to be of order 2040% , while perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) makes a qualitative prediction that the single - spin transverse effects should be very small due to the helicity conservation @xcite .",
    "here we present new ssa measurements carried out at the 70  gev protvino accelerator in the reaction @xmath1 at 70  gev in the central region ( @xmath5 ) and in the reaction @xmath2 at 40  gev in the polarized target fragmentation region .",
    "@xmath0 in the reaction @xmath1 was measured using 70  gev protons extracted by a bent crystal from the accelerator vacuum chamber .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup70 ] .      polarized target . ]    three scintillation counters s1s3 were used for a zero level trigger with a coincidence from two hodoscopes h1h2 ( each consisted of two planes ) .",
    "@xmath6-quanta were detected by two electromagnetic lead - glass calorimeters emc1 and emc2 ( arrays of 480 and 144 cells correspondingly ) placed 7 and 2.8  m downstream the frozen polarized target with 80% average polarization .",
    "first level trigger on transverse energy worked independently for the both detectors .",
    "angle @xmath7 in the laboratory frame corresponds to @xmath8 in the center of mass system ( c.m.s . ) for 70  gev proton beam .",
    "we were able to detect @xmath9-s till @xmath10  gev / c using specially developed algorithm for the overlapping showers reconstruction @xcite .",
    "@xmath9 mass resolution was 10  mev/@xmath11 for emc1 and from 12 to 16  mev/@xmath11 for emc2 .",
    "two dimensional distribution @xmath12 was symmetrical on @xmath13 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : cross]a ) .",
    "the slope of relative @xmath9-cross - section presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] is in good agreement with the previous measurements of charged pion invariant cross - section . in this experiment",
    "an exponential constant @xmath14 , while fods experiment ( protvino ) found @xmath15 for @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we have analysed the experimental data of other experiments and concluded that the asymmetry arises in the energy range between 1.5 and 2.0  gev for all fixed target experiments ( fig .  [ fig : scal ] , right ) .",
    "finally we may summarize :    * @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath19 at 70  gev equals to zero in the central region for @xmath20  gev / c and is in agreement with the e704 result .",
    "* in the reaction @xmath2 at 40  gev in the polarized target fragmentation region @xmath21 at @xmath22 and @xmath23  gev / c and close to zero at small @xmath24 and @xmath25  gev / c .",
    "* the last result is similar to the @xmath9 asymmetry in the polarized beam fragmentation region measured by e704 and star experiments .",
    "the @xmath9 inclusive production in the polarized proton fragmentation region can be considered as a proper reaction for polarimetry . *",
    "the asymmetry in fixed target experiments arises at @xmath26 from 1.5 to 2.0  gev / c independently on the beam energy and kinematic region .",
