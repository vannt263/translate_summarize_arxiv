    "the dynamics of periodically - driven stochastic systems has been an active field of research over the last years @xcite .",

    "examples are found in problems involving transport at the cellular level @xcite , optical and electronic devices @xcite and signal transduction in neuronal tissue @xcite , to cite just a few .",
    "a particularly interesting phenomenon , occurring in periodically - driven non - linear noisy systems , is stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "this term refers to the enhancement of the response of the system to a coherent signal when the intensity of the noise grows , instead of the degradation that one naively expects .",
    "the mechanism leading to this phenomenon is quite simple .",
    "imagine a system which exhibits an energetic activation barrier . in the presence of noise , the system can be assumed to surmount this barrier with a rate proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the height of the barrier and d is the intensity of the noise acting on the system .",
    "the inverse of this rate defines the average waiting time , @xmath2 , between two noise - induced transitions . in the presence of a periodic forcing ,",
    "the height of the barrier is periodically raised an lowered .",
    "when the period of the external force synchronizes with @xmath3 , the barrier surmounting will be enhanced by the cooperative effect of the noise and the periodic forcing .",
    "although originally proposed for systems in a double - well potential , this original scheme has been overcome .",
    "in fact , it is known that sr is exhibited by several classes of monostable systems , among which one could mention excitable and threshold systems @xcite or systems which do not follow an activated dynamics but a relaxational dynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will show that a magnetic dipole immerse in a shear flow exhibits stochastic resonance when a weak oscillating magnetic field is acting on it .",
    "the presence of this flow takes the system out of equilibrium impressing certain peculiarities in the behaviour of this system . in order to treat this problem",
    "we will analyze the response of the system in the linear regime .",
    "previous study of the dynamics of a dipole under an oscillating magnetic field has revealed that linear response theory ( lrt ) predicts a monotonically decreasing behaviour for the ratio between the output signal and the output noise or signal to noise ratio ( snr ) , _ i.e. _ for very weak applied fields the dipole does not exhibit sr @xcite . in the present case",
    "there is a new ingredient , absent in @xcite : the presence of the shear flow , which is determinant for many interesting aspects of the dynamics of this system .",
    "additionally , although we show the existence of sr in the linear regime , we discuss limitations and role of the lrt in its application to the theory of sr , mainly related to questions concerning the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",

    "we have shown that the relaxation process of a dipole immersed in a shear flow exhibits sr upon application of a weak periodic field . to this end",
    "we have computed three quantities typically used to characterize sr , namely the signal - to - noise ratio , the escape - time distribution and the mean first passage time .",
    "all of them behave as expected for a process in which sr occurs .",
    "previous works devoted to analyze whether or not sr is present in the relaxation process of an overdamped dipole in a fluid at rest have revealed that this phenomenon does not occur in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "effectively , linear response theory ( lrt ) predicts a maximum in the signal , _",
    "i.e. _ in the susceptibility , as a function of the noise level",
    ". unlikely , the snr decreases monotonically with the noise level .",
    "this behaviour can be easily understood . in the limit of zero noise",
    "the output of the system has a small component ( proportional to the applied field ) at the frequency of the signal whereas the background noise vanishes at zero noise level , being this behaviour the responsible for the monotonic dependence of the snr on the noise intensity .    in our case ,",
    "the situation is completely different .",
    "when the fluid in which the dipole is suspended is submitted to a pure rotation ( vortex flow ) , both output signal and output background noise exhibit a peak at the same value of @xmath173 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . consequently , although the background noise vanishes when @xmath173 goes to zero , the characteristic sr profile of the snr can not be completely hidden , as shown in fig .",
    "this feature arises as a consequence of the presence of shear acting on the suspension , thus , the appearance of sr in the system studied in this paper is a non - equilibrium feature .    in a sense ,",
    "the mechanism yielding sr in this system is similar to the one operating in sr in threshold devices @xcite . due to the presence of noise",
    ", the dipole can eventually acquire enough energy to get out from its stable orientation by crossing the absorbing barrier ( the threshold ) @xmath130 .",
    "after this , the system is driven to its stable position .",
    "this process produces a short spike in the magnetization .",
    "of course , the time that the system takes to return to the fixed point has to be smaller than the semiperiod of the oscillating magnetic field .",
    "thus , sr in this system can be understood in the same way as , for example , the sr in level crossing detectors @xcite .",
    "lrt has been one of the widest used tools in the study of stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "when the system , in the absence of the external periodic force , is in thermal equilibrium a very adequate form of describing stochastic resonance is in terms of the susceptibility .",
    "this is because the noisy part of the power spectrum is given directly by the susceptibility through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ,    @xmath174    this result is correct when the fluctuations whose spectral density is given by @xmath175 have the thermal equilibrium state as reference state @xcite .",
    "however , in the present case we are dealing with a system which is maintained in an out - of - equilibrium steady state due to the presence of a shear flow .",
    "it is evident from fig . 5 , where we have plotted the imaginary part of the susceptibility corresponding to @xmath85 and the noisy part of the power spectrum , that these two quantities are clearly different .",
    "note , that if @xmath176 , _ i.e. _ the system in the absence of the periodic field is in equilibrium , the relation ( [ 2.100 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "thus , we have shown that although we can define a susceptibility which describes the response of our system to a small perturbation we can not describe sr by means of lrt .",
    "the reason can be found in the fact that due to the non - equilibrium nature of the attractor of the dynamics the fluctuation - dissipation theorem fails to be valid .    *",
