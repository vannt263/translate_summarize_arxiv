    "the author s dirac medal lecture at watoc@xmath705 focused on some recent advances in the area of computational thermochemistry in general , and on the w@xmath8 ( weizmann-@xmath8 ) theory@xcite developed in our own laboratory in particular .",

    "rather , we will present an example practical application .",
    "perchloric acid , hclo@xmath0 , and its anhydride , cl@xmath1o@xmath2 , have been known for nearly two centuries@xcite .",
    "industrial uses of perchloric acid are manifold , and higher chlorine oxides have recently been implicated in theories of stratospheric destruction of ozone@xcite .",
    "( see also two recent papers @xcite on the cl@xmath1o@xmath9 and br@xmath1o@xmath9 series ( n=14 ) and their anions . ) yet no reliable thermochemical data are available : the reason for this is probably best illustrated by the following quote from a spectroscopic study@xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ caution !",
    "_ several explosions occurred during the course of this work .",
    "it was necessary to perform all experiments wearing heavy gloves and a face shield with the sample properly shielded .",

    "compiled@xcite an extensive and chemically diverse set of thermochemical data for the purpose of benchmarking , calibration , and parametrization of computational thermochemistry methods .",
    "their dataset includes cl@xmath1o@xmath2 , for which an unsourced value of @xmath10=65.0 kcal / mol was taken from the wagman et al .",
    "compilation@xcite . an atom - equivalent scheme based on b3lyp/6 - 311++g * * calculations proposed in ref.@xcite yielded its single largest error ( 91 kcal / mol ) for this molecule .",
    "while it is to be expected that this molecule will exhibit very strong inner polarization effects@xcite , it must also be said that the 65.0 kcal / mol number is a crude estimate , and that any comparison with it will be semiquantitative at best .    for hclo@xmath0 , francisco@xcite quotes @xmath10=4@xmath114 kcal / mol from the nist database@xcite , and a group additivity estimate@xcite of -1.5 kcal / mol .",
    "francisco himself calculated @xmath12=+10.8 kcal / mol using g2 theory .",
    "similar remarks apply as for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 .    in the present work",
    ", we will apply w1 and w2 theory to these systems .",
    "we will also show that they are extreme cases of inner polarization effects@xcite and that any calculation that does not adequately take this into account is doomed to failure .",
    "all calculations were run on a 4-cpu amd opteron 846 server with 8 gb of ram , two sata system disks , and eight 72 gb ultrascsi320 scratch disks , running suse linux enterprise server 9 and custom - built for our group by access technologies of reovot , israel .",
    "the scratch disks are operated as two hardware raid-0 arrays of four disks aggregated in software using the linux `` md '' facility . for large soft - raid `` chunk sizes '' of 512 kb and up , we are able to obtain sustained streaming read and write bandwidth in excess of 300 mb / s , as measured by iozone@xcite for a 16 gb file .    the ccsd@xcite and ccsd(t)@xcite coupled cluster calculations involved in w1 and w2 theory were carried out using molpro 2002.6@xcite ( always using conventional rather than integral - direct algorithms ) , while all remaining calculations were carried out using a locally modified version of gaussian 03@xcite .",
    "nbo ( natural bond orbital)@xcite and aim ( atoms - in - molecules)@xcite analyses were carried out using the relevant modules of gaussian 03 .",
    "three families of basis sets were used .",
    "the first are the original aug - cc - pvnz ( augmented correlation consistent polarized n - tuple zeta ) basis sets of dunning and coworkers@xcite : besides the unmodified aug - cc - pvnz sequence , we considered the aug - cc - pvnz+2d1f sequence proposed in the original w1/w2 paper@xcite , where the``+2d1f '' notation represents the addition of two additional @xmath3 and one additional @xmath13 function , with exponents obtained by successively multiplying the highest exponent of that angular momentum already present by a factor of 2.5 .",
    "the second family are the aug - cc - pv(n+d)z basis sets of wilson , peterson , and dunning@xcite , which were specifically developed to cope with inner polarization effects and contain an additional @xmath3 function beyond the original aug - cc - pvnz basis sets .",
    "the third family are the aug - pc@xmath8 ( augmented polarization consistent ) basis sets of jensen@xcite . unlike the correlation consistent basis sets which were developed for optimum recovery of the valence correlation energy , the polarization consistent basis sets were developed for optimum recovery of hartree - fock and dft energies , for which requirements ( in terms of optimum exponents and choice of polarization functions ) are considerably different .",
    "we considered the aug - pc1 , aug - pc2 , aug - pc3 , and aug - pc4 basis sets , which are of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 quality , respectively , on hydrogen , of @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 quality , respectively , on oxygen , and of @xmath21 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath22 quality , respectively , on chlorine . here too , we considered addition of one or more high - exponent @xmath3 and @xmath13 functions ( denoted by `` + d '' , `` + 2d'',  suffixes ) , with exponents again in even - tempered sequences with a stride factor of 2.5 .    detailed descriptions ( and rationales ) for the different steps in w1 and w2 theory can be found in the original references@xcite . in the interest of making the paper",
    "self - contained , we will briefly summarize them :    * a b3lyp / cc - pv(t+d)z@xcite reference geometry is used for w1 theory . normally a ccsd(t)/cc - pv(q+d)z reference geometry is called for in w2 theory : as full ccsd(t)/cc - pv(q+d)z optimizations proved computationally intractable , we have instead used the best available dft geometries@xcite ( at the b97 - 1/aug - pc3+d level@xcite ) .",
    "the actual geometries used can be found in figure 1 ; * the scf component is extrapolated from aug - cc - pvtz+2d1f and aug - cc - pvqz+2d1f basis sets in w1 theory , and from aug - cc - pvqz+2d1f and aug - cc - pv5z+2d1f basis sets in w2 theory , using the formula@xcite @xmath23 ; the acronyms w1w and w2w ( rather than w1 and w2 ) indicate that aug - cc - pv(n+d)z rather than aug - cc - pvnz+2d1f basis sets were used@xcite ; * the ccsd valence correlation component is extrapolated from the same pairs of basis sets using @xmath24 , where @xmath25 for w1 and w1w theory and @xmath26 for w2 theory@xcite ; * the ( t ) valence correlation component is extrapolated using the same expression , but from aug - cc - pvdz+2d and aug - cc - pvtz+2d1f basis sets in the case of w1 theory , and aug - cc - pvtz+2d1f and aug - cc - pvqz+2d1f basis sets for w2 theory ( with the appropriate substitutions in the case of w1w and w2w ) .",
    "note that the expensive ( t ) step need not be carried out in the largest basis set used overall .",
    "note also that rohf references are used for the open - shell atoms , and that the definition of ref.@xcite for the rohf - ccsd(t ) energy is used ; * the differential contribution of inner - shell correlation is obtained at the ccsd(t ) level with a specially developed mtsmall core correlation basis set@xcite ; * the scalar relativistic contribution can be obtained either as first - order mass - velocity and darwin corrections@xcite at the acpf ( averaged coupled pair functional@xcite ) level with the mtsmall basis set , or ( in the gaussian 03@xcite implementation of w1 theory and in the present work ) as the difference between nonrelativistic and second - order douglas - kroll - hess@xcite ccsd(t)/mtsmall energies ; * these being closed - shell molecules , first - order spin - orbit corrections only affect the separated atoms and are obtained from the well - established atomic fine structures ; * the zero - point vibrational energy was obtained from scaled b3lyp / cc - pv(t+d)z harmonic frequencies for w1w theory , and from a recent dft anharmonic force field study@xcite for w2w theory ; * thermal corrections were obtained from the same data , although corrections are required for the hindered rotations in both molecules ( see below ) .",
    "the reference geometries used are given in figure 1 .",
    "most salient results can be found in table 1 : basis set convergence for the scf component is presented in detail in table 2 .",
    "we shall discuss these results component by component .",
    "normally , the hartree - fock component is the easiest one to get right in an ab initio thermochemistry calculation . yet in this case , very strong inner polarization effects cause a sharp dependence of the hartree - fock component of the binding energy on the presence of high - exponent d functions in the basis set .",
    "this can be seen in more detail in table 2 .",
    "for hclo@xmath0 with the aug - cc - pvdz or aug - pc1 basis sets , addition of four high - exponent @xmath3 functions ( with exponents in an even - tempered series with stride 2.5 ) increases the computed binding energy by over 50 kcal / mol : for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 , the magnitude of the effect reaches a whopping 100 kcal / mol !    with aug - cc - pvtz ( or aug - pc2 ) and @xmath27 basis sets , the contributions for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 go down to 45 and 23 kcal / mol , respectively  the aug - pc3 basis set already contains one additional high - exponent d function to begin with , and thus requires less additional @xmath3 functions to reach saturation .",
    "an nbo analysis of the wave function reveals that , while the chlorine @xmath3 orbitals have natural populations in the 0.35 range , these orbitals have rydberg character and do not participate in any natural bond orbitals : as shown repeatedly previously@xcite , there is no basis for describing hclo@xmath0 , nor by extension cl@xmath1o@xmath2 , as hypervalent molecules .",
    "npa , apt ( atomic polar tensor@xcite ) , and aim all yield partial charges consistent with a general ho(cl@xmath28)(o@xmath29)@xmath30 bonding picture ( see below ) .",
    "what happens to the wavefunction when extra @xmath3 functions are added ?",
    "comparing nbo analyses for hclo@xmath0 with aug - pc1 and aug - pc1 + 3d basis sets , we see that the energy of the 3d rydberg orbital on cl is lowered from 0.985 to 0.839 a.u . for @xmath31 , 0.974 to 0.830 a.u . for @xmath32 , 1.200 to 1.016 a.u . for @xmath33 , 1.134 to 0.966 a.u . for @xmath34 , and 1.173 to 0.996 a.u . for @xmath35 .",
    "thus the orbitals become more accessible : overall @xmath36 population increases from 0.28 to 0.37 electron equivalents , with the corresponding nbo occupations clustering in a `` quasi-@xmath37 '' triad of 0.117 , 0.103 , and 0.100 and a `` quasi-@xmath38 '' dyad of 0.0594 and 0.0588 .",
    "( these numbers add up to more than 0.37 as there are small non-@xmath3 components in these orbitals . )",
    "interestingly , the wiberg bond indices for the three short cl  o bonds go up by about 0.05 , and of the long bond by 0.02 .",
    "the increase in the aim ( bader ) covalent bond orders is more pronounced : from 1.27 to 1.421.43 for the short bonds , and from 1.00 to 1.05 for the long bond .",
    "second - order perturbation theory analysis of the nbos reveals , besides the expected interactions between oxygen lone pairs and antibonding clo orbitals , strong interactions between oxygen lone pairs and the @xmath36 rydberg orbitals on chlorine .",
    "consistent with all of this , the aim charge distribution is considerably less polarized with versus without the extra @xmath3 functions ( @xmath39(cl)=3.51 and 3.92 , respectively ) .",
    "the npa charges are not significantly affected ( @xmath39(cl)=2.68 in both cases ) , while the apt charges actually show a mild opposite trend ( 2.58 vs. 2.53 ) .",
    "summing up , the chemical significance of the extra @xmath3 functions is thus that they improve the ability of the @xmath36 orbital to act as an acceptor for backbonding from the oxygen lone pair orbitals .",
    "this situation is , in fact , somewhat reminescent of the role of the 3d orbital in the cao molecule@xcite .    as a result of all this",
    ", basis set convergence for the aug - cc - pvnz series is quite unsatisfactory .",
    "somewhat more satisfying results are obtained with the wilson - peterson - dunning aug - cc - pv(n+d)z series , although even here , there is still an unusually large increment of 0.68 kcal / mol ( for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 : 1.29 kcal / mol ) between the aug - cc - pv(5+d)z and aug - cc - pv(6+d)z basis sets . with the aug - cc - pv@xmath8z+2d1f series advocated in the original w1/w2 paper@xcite , convergence is rather more satisfactory : the aug - cc - pv5z+2d1f basis set actually yields a larger binding energy ( 78.81 kcal / mol ) than the aug - cc - pv(6+d)z and aug - cc - pv6z+d basis set ( 78.70 and 78.76 kcal / mol , respectively ) .",
    "our best directly computed value , with the aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f basis set , is only 0.05 kcal / mol greater .",
    "note that the contribution of the high - exponent @xmath13 function decays rapidly in the aug - cc - pvnz+2d1f series : from 0.98 kcal / mol for @xmath8=t to 0.02 kcal / mol for @xmath8=6 .",
    "note also that even for the aug - cc - pv6z+d basis set , adding a second hard @xmath3 function still contributes 0.08 kcal / mol .    turning to jensen s polarization consistent basis sets  which were specifically developed for scf or dft applications rather than for correlated ab initio calculations",
    " we still see a 0.58 kcal / mol increment between uncontracted aug - pc3+d and aug - pc4 basis sets .",
    "( jensen recommends using uncontracted basis sets for scf energy extrapolations . ) using jensen s recommended extrapolation formula@xcite from aug - pc2 + 2d , aug - pc3+d , and aug - pc4 data ( see footnote c to table 1 for details ) , we obtain a best estimate for tae(scf)=78.94 kcal / mol : for comparison , the best directly computed values are 78.70 kcal / mol for aug - cc - pv(6+d)z , 78.84 kcal / mol for aug - cc - pv6z+2d , 78.86 kcal / mol for aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f , and 78.77 kcal / mol for uncontracted aug - pc4 .    using the aug - cc - pv\\{5,6}z+2d1f data instead with the @xmath40 extrapolation used in w2 theory , we obtain 78.89 kcal / mol as our limit : taking into account jensen s observation that the scf energy for such large basis sets appears to converge much faster than @xmath41 ( see also ref.@xcite ) ,",
    "we take the average of this extrapolation and the raw aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f value , to finally obtain tae(scf)=78.88 kcal / mol .",
    "the w1w extrapolation falls far short at 76.35 kcal / mol , while the performance of the w2w extrapolation , 78.61 kcal / mol , could be deemed acceptable .",
    "( with the `` + 2d1f '' basis set series of standard w2 theory , we would obtain 79.09 kcal / mol , which overshoots the true limit . ) using the efficient direct scf codes presently available , it might well be that the preferred approach for the scf component in problematic cases like this  rather than an extrapolation on purely empirical grounds  would be to carry out a single straight scf calculation with the largest routinely feasible basis set . even in the present extreme case ,",
    "using the raw scf / aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f or scf / aug - pc4+d numbers causes errors under 0.1 kcal / mol .",
    "an scf / aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f calculation on cl@xmath1o@xmath2 , which requires no less than 1,743 basis functions , yields tae(scf)=-30.81 kcal / mol .",
    "@xmath40 extrapolation yields -30.76 kcal / mol , averaging as for hclo@xmath0 -30.79 kcal / mol .",
    "( the raw scf / aug - cc - pv(6+d)z and scf / aug - pc4 values are in error by 0.31 and 0.19 kcal / mol , respectively , suggesting aug - cc - pv6z+2d1f to be the basis set of choice for `` single point '' scf limit calculations . ) in terms of convergence along basis set sequences , the same trends as for hclo@xmath0 are seen in amplified form . we note in passing that the scf reaction energy of the isodesmic reaction 2  @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 + @xmath45 converges quite rapidly with the basis , as long as at least one hard @xmath3 function is present .      as noted previously for so@xmath1 and so@xmath30,@xcite basis set convergence for the valence correlation component",
    "is not anomalous for molecules with severe inner polarization . as for any molecule with highly polar bonds",
    ", however ( see , e.g. , sif@xmath0 @xcite , bf@xmath30 @xcite , and the like ) , a significant difference between w1w and w2w is to be expected .",
    "in the case of hclo@xmath0 , the discrepancy for the ccsd correlation energy is quite modest at 0.5 kcal / mol , and it is partly compensated by a discrepancy of -0.2 kcal / mol for the connected triple excitations contribution .",
    "even a ccsd / aug - cc - pv(q+d)z calculation on cl@xmath1o@xmath2 was only barely feasible with the available hardware : ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pv(q+d)z and ccsd / aug - cc - pv(5+d)z calculations are plainly impossible .",
    "considering the good agreement between w1 and w2 for the valence correlation contributions , however , we can safely assume that this component is well reproduced for the isodesmic reaction .",
    "neither molecule shows any obvious sign of severe static correlation , neither from the @xmath46 diagnostics@xcite ( 0.019 for hclo@xmath0 , 0.021 for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 ) , nor from the largest coupled cluster amplitudes . yet",
    "the fact that three - quarters of the atomization energy of hclo@xmath0 results from correlation , and that cl@xmath1o@xmath2 is actually slightly metastable at the hartree - fock level , suggest that higher - order correlation effects could be somewhat important for these molecules . unfortunately , a w3 calculation for hclo@xmath0  let alone cl@xmath1o@xmath2  is absolutely impossible with the present state of technology .",
    "this appears to be the single greatest source of uncertainty in our calculations .      like with other second - row molecules , despite the rather large absolute inner - shell correlation energies , the inner - shell contribution to the molecular binding energy is rather small ( 0.90 kcal / mol for hclo@xmath0 ) .",
    "a ccsd(t)/mtsmall calculation on cl@xmath1o@xmath2 is not feasible .",
    "we were able to carry out a ccsd(t)/cc - pwcvtz calculation , but this basis set is clearly woefully inadequate for hclo@xmath0 , recovering only about half the contribution .",
    "we might be able to rely on error compensation for the isodesmic reaction , and the inner - shell correlation contribution to its reaction energy is found to be -0.18 kcal / mol at the ccsd(t)/cc - pwcvtz level . from the higher - level results for hclo@xmath0 and h@xmath1o ,",
    "we can then extract a best estimate of 1.38 kcal / mol for the inner - shell contribution to the cl@xmath1o@xmath2 binding energy .",
    "the original w1 and w2 protocols called for mass - velocity and darwin corrections from acpf / mtsmall calculations .",
    "w3 theory , as well as the w1 and w2 implementations in the popular gaussian 03 program package , use ccsd(t ) calculations with the douglas - kroll approximation to obtain the scalar relativistc contribution .",
    "we have followed the same ( more rigorous ) approach here , as the scalar relativistic contributions are generally significant for this type of molecule ( second - row atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by strongly electronegative elements ) . at the dk - ccsd(t)/mtsmall level , we find -2.69 kcal / mol for hclo@xmath0 and a hefty -4.80 kcal / mol for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 . for hclo@xmath0 , we recalculated the contribution using relativistically optimized correlation consistent basis sets@xcite of avtz and avqz quality .",
    "we obtain fundamentally the same result , and upon extrapolation to the infinite - basis limit , we actually reproduce the mtsmall result to two decimal places .",
    "we therefore have not attempted any dk - ccsd(t)/avqz calculation for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 : for the sake of completeness , the dk - ccsd(t)/avtz value is -4.73 kcal / mol .",
    "the first - order spin - orbit contribution results exclusively from the atomic fine structures and requires no further comment .",
    "we expect second - order spin - orbit coupling corrections to be on the order of 0.1 kcal / mol or less , well below the more important potential error sources in these calculations .",
    "the scaled b3lyp / cc - pv(t+d)z harmonic frequencies normally used for the zero - point energy in w1w theory is clearly falling short a bit in these cases .",
    "from a very recent dft anharmonic force field study@xcite on both molecules , we have available anharmonic zpves at the b97 - 1/aug - pc3+d level .",
    "our `` best estimate '' value for hclo@xmath0 was obtained by combining the anharmonic zpve with one - half the difference between the computed and observed fundamental frequencies . for cl@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "the assignment of the experimental vibrational spectrum is too fraught with ambiguities to allow for the same approach : here we have assumed the ratio between the `` best estimate '' and directly computed zpves for hclo@xmath0 to be transferable to cl@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the thermal correction represents the minor complication of hindered clo@xmath30 rotations . in the case of hclo@xmath0",
    ", we find the internal rotation barrier @xmath47 to be 0.647 kcal / mol at the b97 - 1/aug - pc2 + 2d level , which corresponds to a @xmath48 ratio of nearly one . at the same level",
    ", we obtain a reduced moment for the internal rotor of 2.9853 amu.bohr@xmath49 . with a de - facto rotor periodicity of three ,",
    "we obtain @xmath50 from eq.(4 ) of pitzer and gwinn@xcite . by interpolating their table v ,",
    "we obtain 1.054 e.u . , or 0.53 r , for @xmath51 , i.e. , very close to the free rotor limit of @xmath52 and considerably removed from the low - frequency harmonic vibration limit of @xmath53 .",
    "our ` best estimate ' values reflect this correction for hclo@xmath0 , and twice this correction for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "clearly , it will cancel in the isodesmic reaction .",
    "our final best estimate for the heat of formation of hclo@xmath0 is -0.6 kcal / mol .",
    "we expect this value to be accurate to about 1 kcal / mol , with the largest potential source of error being post - ccsd(t ) correlation effects .",
    "this value actually agrees quite well with colussi and grela s group additivity estimate of -1.5 kcal / mol . the large discrepancy between the g2 theory@xcite result of francisco@xcite , @xmath54 + 10.8 kcal / mol and our own absolute - zero heat of formation of 2.4 kcal / mol",
    "should not be surprising considering the extreme basis set sensitivity pointed out here . using the more up - to - date g3 theory@xcite , we obtain tae@xmath55=307.9 kcal / mol ( compared to 305.4 kcal / mol for g2 ) , or 306.2 kcal / mol after applying the atomic spin - orbit correction ( -1.73 kcal / mol ) : g3 thus still underbinds the molecule by 7.6 kcal / mol compared to our best estimate ( tae@xmath55=313.8 kcal / mol ) .",
    "g3x theory@xcite , which was recently developed in an attempt to ( inter alia ) reduce errors for ( pseudo)hypervalent compounds , recovers an additional 5.64 kcal / mol worth of binding energy and thus reduces the error to a respectable 2 kcal / mol . while g3 uses an mp2/6 - 31 g * reference geometry ( which will have very substantial basis set incompleteness error for this type of molecules ) , g3x uses b3lyp/6 - 31g(2df,2p )",
    " in particular the extra @xmath3 function very significantly affects the computed reference geometry .",
    "in addition , g3x involves a step where a single @xmath56 function is added to the basis set at the hf level : this does affect the energy by 2.01 kcal / mol , which appears to be a slight overestimate , as we find the @xmath56 function contribution in the aug - pc3 basis set to be only 1.45 kcal / mol .",
    "our best estimated heat of formation for cl@xmath1o@xmath2 ( obtained from the w1w isodesmic reaction energy and our best calculated data for hclo@xmath0 and h@xmath1o ) is 65.9 kcal / mol , to which we attach a conservative error bar of 2 kcal / mol .",
    "this is actually quite close to the wagman et al.@xcite estimate of @xmath10=65.0 kcal / mol and the rhl et al.@xcite mass spectrometric value of 65@xmath114 kcal / mol .",
    "li et al.@xcite used a variety of methods from the g2 and g3 family , and found 76.8 kcal / mol at the g3 level , 84.9 kcal / mol at the g3(mp3 ) level , and 66.7 kcal / mol at the g2(mp2 ) level , which is fortuitously in much better agreement with our best value than the more sophisticated g3-based methods .",
    "once again , we find that g3x theory puts in a much better performance : after spin - orbit correction , we obtain tae@xmath55=399.47 kcal / mol , again within 2 kcal / mol of our best estimate .",
    "the g3x @xmath56 function is found to account for 3.94 kcal / mol ( once again , an overestimate compared to the 2.86 kcal / mol from the @xmath56 functions in the aug - pc3 basis set ) , with most of the rest once again being accounted for by the superior reference geometry .",
    "sicre and cobos@xcite obtained 93.1 kcal / mol at the b3lyp/6 - 311+g(3d2f ) level , 78.9 kcal / mol at the mpw1pw91 level with the same basis set , 86.2 kcal / mol at the g3(mp2)//b3lyp level and 79.5 kcal / mol at the g3(mp2)//b3lyp/6 - 311+g(3d2f ) level .",
