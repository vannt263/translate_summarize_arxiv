    "in mean  field electrodynamics the mean electromotive force @xmath0 due to the fluctuations @xmath1 and @xmath2 of the fluid velocity and the magnetic field plays a crucial role @xcite . a central problem is the determination of @xmath4 for a given motion as a functional of the mean magnetic field .",
    "various methods have been used for that .",
    "one approach , which we call  traditional approach \" or  approach ( i ) \" in the following , was established together with mean  field electrodynamics at all @xcite .",
    "most of the calculations of @xmath4 have been done on this basis using the so  called second  order correlation approximation ( soca ) or , what means the same , first ",
    "order smoothing approximation ( fosa ) .",
    "this approximation in its original form , that is , applied in the case of a purely hydrodynamic background turbulence , ignores all higher than second  order correlations in the fluctuations @xmath1 of the velocity field ( see section  [ subsec31 ] ) .",
    "it can be justified only in cases in which these fluctuations are not too large .",
    "the usually given simple sufficient conditions for its validity are in view of astrophysical applications rather narrow .",
    "basically it is possible to proceed to higher  order approximations but this requires tremendous efforts and has been done so far only in a few simple cases ( nicklaus and stix 1988 , carvalho 1992 , 1994 , rdler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , see also section  [ new1 ] ) .",
    "a slight modification of the second  order correlation approximation applies also to the case of a magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence ( see section  [ subsec32 ] ) .    in some more recent investigations ( which are cited below )",
    "other approaches are used , which rely in a sense on the @xmath3approximation of turbulence theory @xcite and are called  @xmath3-approaches \" or  approaches ( ii ) \" in the following .",
    "they go in so far beyond the second  order correlation approximation as they consider also higher  order correlations , which are then in the sense of a closure expressed by second",
    " order ones . in approach ( i )",
    "the relevant equations are simplified by a well  defined approximation and then really solved , and @xmath4 is calculated with these solutions . in the approaches",
    "( ii ) a relation for @xmath4 is deduced from the original equations , but without really solving them . instead , in order to get manageable results , assumptions on the connection of some of the occurring quantities with @xmath4 are introduced .",
    "the final result for @xmath4 is to a large extent determined by these assumptions .",
    "the approaches ( ii ) cover from the very beginning also the case of a magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is a critical analysis of the approaches ( ii ) .",
    "each step of approach ( i ) can be justified by the underlying induction equation or , in the case of a magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence , induction equation and momentum balance .",
    "clear , at least sufficient conditions for the applicability of the second  order approximation can be given .",
    "there is no doubt in the correctness of its results in the so defined range of applicability .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume , and we do so in this paper , that there is at least some overlap of the ranges of applicability of the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "we have then to require that in these overlapping ranges the results of both approaches coincide .",
    "simple versions of approach ( ii ) as used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , called  simple @xmath3approach \" or  approach ( iia ) \" in the following , deliver results which do not in all cases satisfy this requirement . as we will show below the more sophisticated version used in the papers by @xcite and by @xcite , called",
    " spectral @xmath3approach \" or  approach ( iib ) \" , does not satisfy this requirement , too .",
    "we have to conclude that these approaches are not in full accordance with the basic equations mentioned .",
    "therefore the results can not be taken for granted .",
    "we will propose a starting point for an alternative approach which avoids conflicts with approach ( i ) .",
    "in section  [ model ] we define the frame of our considerations and deliver the basic equations . in section  [ seci ]",
    "we recall the fundamentals of approach ( i ) and review some of its basic results . in section  [ secii ]",
    "we explain the approaches ( iia ) and ( iib ) , derive a few results , restricting attention to the simple case of a non  rotating fluid , and pinpoint shortcomings of these approaches and deviations of the results from those of approach ( i ) . in section",
    "[ new ] we explain a proposal for the alternative approach mentioned .",
    "finally in section  [ sum ] we summarize our findings .",
    "let us first define the frame of our considerations .",
    "we want to explain essential features of the various approaches to the mean electromotive force @xmath4 but do not strive to a high level of generality .",
    "let us consider the magnetic field @xmath5 in an electrically conducting moving fluid .",
    "we assume that it is governed by the induction equation @xmath6 here @xmath7 means the velocity of the fluid and @xmath8 its magnetic diffusivity , assumed to be constant . until further notice we consider the fluid motion , that is @xmath7 , as given .",
    "we assume that the motion and therefore also the magnetic field shows irregular , e.g. turbulent , features .",
    "any field @xmath9 of this type is split into a mean field @xmath10 and a  fluctuating \" field @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 .",
    "the mean field @xmath10 is defined as an average of @xmath9 .",
    "it is assumed that the averaging procedure satisfies the reynolds averaging rules . alternatively to the notation @xmath10 we use also @xmath13 in the following .",
    "averaging the induction equation ( [ eq101 ] ) we obtain the mean  field induction equation @xmath14 with the mean electromotive force @xmath4 given by @xmath15    elaboration of mean  field electrodynamics means studying the properties of this quantity . for this purpose",
    "we rely on the equation for the fluctuations @xmath2 which follows from ( [ eq101 ] ) and ( [ eq103 ] ) , @xmath16 here @xmath17 stands for a term of second order in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "as can be concluded from ( [ eq105 ] ) and ( [ eq107 ] ) the mean electromotive force @xmath4 depends , apart from initial and boundary conditions for @xmath2 , on @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath4 is a functional of these quantities in the sense that @xmath4 in a given point in space and time depends on @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 also in other space points and at past times .",
    "this functional is linear in @xmath21 . for most of the applications it is reasonable to assume that it is in addition local in the sense that @xmath4 in a point in space and time depends only on @xmath20 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 in a certain surroundings of this point . likewise in many applications",
    "the variations of @xmath21 in space and time are sufficiently weak so that the behavior of @xmath21 inside the relevant surroundings of a given point can be represented by @xmath21 and its first spatial derivatives in this point",
    ". then we have @xmath22 where the quantities @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are functionals of @xmath20 and @xmath1 in the above sense but do not depend on @xmath21 .",
    "assume for a simple example that there is no mean motion , @xmath26 , and that @xmath1 corresponds to a homogeneous isotropic , not necessarily mirror  symmetric turbulence .",
    "since no isotropic vector exists , @xmath23 must be equal to zero .",
    "further @xmath24 and @xmath25 have to be isotropic tensors , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with factors @xmath29 and @xmath30 being averaged quantities depending on @xmath1 .",
    "consequently we have @xmath31 for another simple example we remain with @xmath26 and assume that @xmath1 corresponds to an inhomogeneous turbulence in a rotating system , that is , under the influence of a coriolis force .",
    "more precisely , @xmath1 deviates from a homogeneous isotropic mirror  symmetric turbulence only by an inhomogeneity and therefore an anisotropy described by a vector @xmath32 parallel to the intensity gradient , and by the anisotropy and the deviation from mirror  symmetry described by the angular velocity @xmath33 responsible for the coriolis force .",
    "then @xmath23 needs no longer to be zero , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are no longer purely isotropic tensors . for the sake of simplicity we nevertheless at first ignore @xmath23 , referring to the comments in sections [ seci ] , [ subsubsec311 ] , [ subsubsec314 ] , [ subsubsec321 ] and [ new1 ] .",
    "we further assume that the influences of @xmath32 and @xmath33 on the turbulence are weak enough so that @xmath4 is linear in these quantities .",
    "considering then the symmetry properties of the basic equations ( see , e.g. , krause and rdler 1971 , 1980 ) we have @xmath34 where the coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 @xmath38 are determined by @xmath1 only .",
    "( the choice of the signs in ( [ eq115 ] ) , which follows some other papers , is however unimportant at this place . )",
    "given the structures of @xmath4 as in these examples the only remaining task is the calculation of coefficients like @xmath29 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    "the approximations we want to discuss in this paper concern only these calculations .",
    "later we will relax the assumption that the fluid motion , that is @xmath7 , is given . in preparation to this",
    "we provide here the relevant relations . restricting our attention to an incompressible fluid",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is governed by the momentum balance , @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the mass density , @xmath41 the hydrodynamic ( including centrifugal ) pressure , @xmath42 the kinematic viscosity , considered as constant , and @xmath43 means an external force . a rotating frame of reference is assumed , with @xmath33 being the angular velocity that defines the coriolis force .    taking the average of equations ( [ eq121 ] ) we obtain @xmath44 with a mean ponderomotive force @xmath45 given by @xmath46    in view of both @xmath4 and @xmath45 the equations for the fluctuations @xmath1 are of interest .",
    "they can be concluded from ( [ eq121 ] ) and ( [ eq123 ] ) , @xmath47 @xmath48 stands for the terms of second order in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath49 where @xmath50 etc .    for many purposes",
    "it is necessary to eliminate the pressure term @xmath51 in ( [ eq127 ] ) .",
    "assuming an infinitely extended fluid we find @xmath52 with @xmath53 the fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are by construction divergence  free .",
    "the vector potential @xmath59 of @xmath1 satisfies @xmath60    for various purposes it is reasonable to consider @xmath61 as constant .",
    "then we have @xmath62 we note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "analogous relations apply to @xmath65 if @xmath66 is constant .",
    "all quantities that occur in ( [ eq143 ] ) to ( [ eq145 ] ) may depend also on time , but for the sake of simplicity we have dropped the argument @xmath67 everywhere .",
    "in view of a later comparison with @xmath3approaches we repeat here basic ideas of the traditional approach to the mean electromotive force @xmath4 and summarize some general results ( see also , e.g. , krause and rdler 1980 or rdler 2000 ) .",
    "we recall that many applications have been made in the astrophysical context ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we exclude any mean motion of the fluid , that is , @xmath26 . if @xmath1 is given , @xmath2 is determined by equation ( [ eq107 ] ) and proper initial and boundary conditions .",
    "this equation is inhomogeneous in @xmath2 due to the term with @xmath21 .",
    "any solution can be considered as a superposition of a solution of the homogeneous equation , which is independent of @xmath21 , and a solution of the full equation which is linear and homogeneous in @xmath21 .",
    "if there is a non  decaying solution of the homogeneous equation the mean electromotive force @xmath4 may have a non  decaying part , say @xmath68 , independent of @xmath21 ( see , e.g. , rdler 1976 , 2000 ) . if @xmath69 such solutions correspond to small  scale dynamos . until further notice we assume however that @xmath2 decays to zero as soon as @xmath21 is equal to zero . in this case ,",
    "discussed in section [ subsec31 ] , we speak of  purely hydrodynamic background turbulence \" .",
    "later , in section [ subsec32 ] , we will admit a non  decaying @xmath2 even if @xmath21 is equal to zero and then speak of  magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence \" .",
    "we use the word  turbulence \" here in a wide sense .",
    "if not specified otherwise @xmath1 and @xmath2 are considered as fields with arbitrary space and time dependencies but , of course , with zero averages .",
    "we start here with the induction equation ( [ eq107 ] ) for the magnetic fluctuations @xmath2 .",
    "as already mentioned we exclude any mean motion , that is , put @xmath26 .",
    "we use the second  order correlation approximation , here defined by neglecting the term @xmath17 in equation ( [ eq107 ] ) .",
    "then this equation takes the simple form @xmath70 until further notice a non  zero divergence of @xmath1 is admitted .",
    "we assume that equation ( [ eq200 ] ) applies in all infinite space .",
    "then its general solution can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a green s function , @xmath73 and @xmath74 means an initial time .",
    "we note that here , as a consequence of the neglect of @xmath17 , solutions @xmath2 which do not decay for @xmath75 are automatically excluded .    for the calculation of @xmath4",
    "we start from @xmath76 consider @xmath77 as sufficiently large so that @xmath78 and let , for simplicity only , finally @xmath79 . in this way we find @xmath80 with the second  rank velocity correlation tensor @xmath81 defined by @xmath82",
    "we further assume sufficiently weak variations of @xmath21 in @xmath83 and @xmath67 , and put under the integral in the sense of a truncated taylor expansion @xmath84 ignoring all other terms , that is , those with @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "in this way we find relation ( [ eq111 ] ) with @xmath88 , that is @xmath89 , and @xmath90      in order to formulate conditions under which the above results apply we introduce the magnetic reynolds number @xmath91 and the strouhal number @xmath92 , @xmath93 here @xmath94 means a characteristic value of the fluctuating velocity @xmath1 , and @xmath95 and @xmath96 are a characteristic length and a characteristic time of the variations of @xmath1 . if @xmath1 describes a turbulence @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be interpreted as correlation length and correlation time .",
    "we further define the dimensionless parameter @xmath97 by @xmath98 it gives the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time @xmath99 for a fluid element whose size is characterized by @xmath95 to the time @xmath96 .",
    "we have then @xmath100 .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath92 is fixed , the limit @xmath101 coincides with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "sometimes the limits @xmath104 and @xmath102 are denoted by  high",
    " conductivity limit \" and  low  conductivity limit \" , respectively .",
    "this notation , introduced with the idea of varying @xmath8 for fixed finite values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , might however be misleading .",
    "if , e.g. , @xmath95 and @xmath8 are fixed , @xmath104 and @xmath102 correspond to @xmath105 or @xmath106 , that is , very quick or very slow variation of @xmath1 in time . when discussing the limits @xmath104 or @xmath102 in the following we always consider @xmath95 as finite and @xmath96 as non  zero .",
    "the second  order correlation approximation applies as soon as the neglect of @xmath17 in ( [ eq107 ] ) is justified .",
    "a sufficient condition for that is @xmath107 . if @xmath108 this is equivalent to @xmath109 , if @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "we may sum up this by saying that a sufficient condition reads @xmath112 ( see also , e.g. , krause and rdler 1971 , 1980 or rdler 2000 ) .",
    "incidentally , determinations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been done within the framework of numerical simulations of magnetoconvection or dynamos without using the second  order correlation approximation .",
    "it turned out that , e.g. , for @xmath113 there is a rather good agreement of the results for these quantities with those obtained in the second  order correlation approximation not only for @xmath109 but for values of @xmath91 up to about 10 @xcite .      let us specify the above results for @xmath114 and @xmath115 to the limiting cases with respect to @xmath97 . as shown in appendix  [ app1 ] , in the limit @xmath104 the relations ( [ eq213 ] ) for @xmath114 and @xmath115 turn into @xmath116 a contribution to @xmath115 containing @xmath117 , which is because of @xmath118 meaningless for @xmath4 , has been omitted .    in the limit @xmath102",
    "we obtain @xmath119    we note that these results for the limits @xmath104 and @xmath102 can also be derived from equation ( [ eq200 ] ) with @xmath120 or @xmath121 , respectively , cancelled @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , for the limit @xmath104 then , without introducing ( [ eq209 ] ) or similar assumptions , no contributions to @xmath4 with higher than first ",
    "order spatial derivatives of @xmath21 occur .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that , when considering first the general result for @xmath4 with higher spatial derivatives ( rdler 1968a , b ) and proceeding then to the limit @xmath104 all the coefficients of the higher than first  order spatial derivatives vanish .",
    "this finding might give some justification for considering no contributions to @xmath4 with higher than first ",
    "order spatial derivatives in astrophysical applications , in which the limit @xmath104 is a good approximation",
    ". there is , however , no general justification to ignore contributions to @xmath4 with time derivatives of @xmath21 .",
    "by contrast , in the case @xmath102 contributions to @xmath4 with higher spatial derivatives of @xmath21 are well possible but no contributions with time derivatives of @xmath21 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the special case of a homogeneous isotropic turbulence , for which @xmath4 takes the form ( [ eq113 ] ) , that is @xmath122 . for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which are independent of position",
    ", we find then from ( [ eq213 ] ) @xmath123 due to the assumed isotropy of the turbulence we may replace @xmath124 by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 . incidentally , since @xmath72 and all averages @xmath127 depend on @xmath128 via @xmath129 only we may replace the integrals @xmath130 by @xmath131 .    in the limit @xmath104 we have @xmath132 this result is often written in the form @xmath133 here @xmath134 and @xmath135 are just defined by equating the right  hand sides of ( [ eq241 ] ) to those of ( [ eq243 ] ) , respectively .",
    "this is , of course , only possible under the reasonable assumption that @xmath136 at @xmath137 is unequal to zero .",
    "it seems plausible to assume that both @xmath134 and @xmath135 are of the order of the correlation time @xmath96 of the turbulent velocity field . there is , however , hardly a general reason for their exact equality .",
    "remarkably , as explained in appendix  [ app2 ] , in the case of an incompressible fluid and statistically steady turbulence the right  hand sides of ( [ eq241 ] ) can also be expressed by integrals containing @xmath138 or @xmath139 , taken over all @xmath129 .    in the limit @xmath102",
    "we obtain @xmath140 again the integrals @xmath141 may be replaced by @xmath142 .",
    "incidentally , the results ( [ eq247 ] ) take a simple form if we represent @xmath1 by @xmath143 with the vector potential @xmath59 and a scalar potential @xmath144 .",
    "they read then @xmath145 ( see , e.g. , krause and rdler 1971 , 1980 , but note that there is a sign error in krause and rdler 1971 ) .      in the above calculation of the electromotive force @xmath4 no other restrictions concerning the fluctuating fluid velocity @xmath1",
    "have been used than some  smallness \" which ensures the applicability of the second  order correlation approximation .",
    "we note that in this approximation if , as so far done , a purely hydrodynamic turbulence is considered and any influence of the initial @xmath2 is ignored , @xmath4 does not contain a part @xmath68 .",
    "we may of course specify the velocity @xmath1 or its correlation tensor @xmath81 such that they correspond to a turbulence on a rotating body , that is , subject to a coriolis force .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 and @xmath81 on the angular velocity @xmath33 responsible for the coriolis force has to be calculated on the basis of the momentum balance ( [ eq141 ] ) .",
    "likewise we may consider a turbulence under the influence of a given mean magnetic field , that is , under the action of the lorentz force , and specify @xmath1 , again on the basis of the momentum balance , to be a function of @xmath21 and its derivatives . in that sense",
    "the above derivations may serve also as a starting point for investigations of the quenching of the mean  field induction effects by the mean magnetic field .    as for higher than second  order correlation approximations",
    "we refer to section  [ new1 ] .",
    "let us relax the assumption that @xmath2 decays to zero if @xmath21 vanishes , that is , admit a magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence .",
    "we assume the fluid to be incompressible .",
    "in addition to the induction equation ( [ eq107 ] ) we use now from the very beginning also the momentum balance in the form ( [ eq141 ] ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we restrict our attention to a non  rotating fluid , that is @xmath146 , and exclude again any mean motion , @xmath26",

    "consider the special case in which the nonlinear terms @xmath17 and @xmath48 tend to zero , that is , @xmath271 , or @xmath272 .",
    "we have to require that then results of approach ( iia ) like ( [ eq323 ] ) or ( [ eq325 ] ) turn into the corresponding results of approach ( i ) .",
    "there is indeed some similarity of the results ( [ eq323 ] ) and ( [ eq325 ] ) with the results ( [ eq227 ] ) and ( [ eq243 ] ) , or ( [ eq289 ] ) and ( [ eq303 ] ) of approach ( i ) in the limit @xmath205 .",
    "however , ( [ eq323 ] ) and ( [ eq325 ] ) do not reflect the fact indicated by ( [ eq227 ] ) and ( [ eq289 ] ) , or ( [ eq241 ] ) and ( [ eq301 ] ) , that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , or @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in this limit depend on correlations between the components of @xmath1 at two different times . according to the above reasoning the results ( [ eq323 ] ) and ( [ eq325 ] ) should at the same time correspond to the results of approach ( i ) for the limit @xmath273 , that is , ( [ eq231 ] ) and ( [ eq247 ] ) , or ( [ eq291 ] ) .",
    "this applies obviously at best in a very crude sense . in particular ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , or @xmath29 and @xmath30 , on correlations of components of @xmath1 in different points in space is not reproduced .",
    "there is another remarkable difference of the results of approaches ( iia ) and ( i ) .",
    "consider the case of a purely hydrodynamic background turbulence .",
    "in approach ( i ) the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 as given by ( [ eq213 ] ) , ( [ eq227 ] ) or ( [ eq231 ] ) depend only on the correlation properties of @xmath1 but , even if @xmath1 is influenced by the magnetic field , not explicitly on those of @xmath2 ; see also section  [ subsubsec324 ] . in the relation ( [ eq323 ] ) of approach ( iia ) , however , in addition to terms with @xmath1 also such with @xmath2 occur , which need not to be negligible beyond the limit of small @xmath21 . in the relations for @xmath29 given with ( [ eq325 ] ) and ( [ eq327 ] ) terms with @xmath2 occur , too . whereas ( [ eq325 ] ) applies to isotropic turbulence and thus seems reasonable for small",
    "@xmath21 only , ( [ eq327 ] ) can be considered for larger @xmath21 , where this term needs no longer to be small .",
    "admitting again magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence we further note that the times @xmath208 and @xmath209 in relation ( [ eq303 ] ) for @xmath29 , which has been derived in approach ( i ) , need not to coincide . in the corresponding result ( [ eq325 ] ) of approach ( iia ) , however , only one comparable time , @xmath240 , occurs .",
    "since there is hardly any reason to doubt in the results of approach ( i ) we conclude that those of approach ( iia ) are , at least in the range of the validity of approach ( i ) , not completely correct .",
    "this , of course , calls also results of approach ( iia ) for more general cases into question .",
    "we further remark that there is no straightforward extension of approach ( iia ) as presented above to the case of turbulence in a rotating system . in this case",
    "the equation that occurs instead of ( [ eq313 ] ) contains in addition to @xmath4 , which is defined by a product of @xmath1 and @xmath2 with both taken at the same point , also a term with a product of @xmath1 and @xmath2 taken at different points .",
    "then @xmath4 can no longer be determined on the simple way used above .",
    "it is to be expected that @xmath24 and @xmath25 contain correlations of components of @xmath1 at different points in space .",
    "finally , even an extension in that sense can hardly deliver a correct result for a contribution to @xmath4 like @xmath274 in ( [ eq115 ] ) , because of @xmath275 often discussed as  @xmath276effect \" . in approach ( i )",
    "this contribution results , at least in the case of homogeneous turbulence , from a part of the correlation tensor @xmath81 of @xmath1 which is odd in the difference @xmath3 of the times at which the components of @xmath1 are taken , see appendix  [ app3 ] .",
    "this part , however , does not occur at all in approach ( iia ) , which considers only correlations of the components of @xmath1 at the same time .",
    "the relation ( [ eq325 ] ) for @xmath29 is often used as a starting point for investigations on @xmath29quenching , e.g. , in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we point out that this relation applies only for isotropic turbulence , that is , in the limit @xmath254 .",
    "investigations on @xmath29quenching carried out within the framework of approach ( iia ) should rather start from a relation like ( [ eq327 ] ) . on this level , of course , instead of the simple relations for @xmath212 used in the mentioned investigations , which have been concluded from the magnetic helicity balance , corresponding relations for quantities like @xmath277 are needed .",
    "moreover , as we know from the above comparison with approach ( i ) , in the case of a purely hydrodynamic background turbulence the existence of a magnetic contribution to @xmath29 and so its role in @xmath29quenching is questionable .",
    "let us consider the approach used in the papers by @xcite and by @xcite .",

    "this difference occurs here , too . in this case in approach ( i ) the quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 , or @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can always be represented by the correlation properties of @xmath1 . in approach ( iib )",
    "however , beyond the limit of small @xmath21 , the expressions for these quantities except @xmath30 contain both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we see that approach ( iib ) to @xmath4 delivers results which even under comparable conditions deviate from the results of approach ( i ) , which we consider as correct",
    ". therefore also beyond the range of validity of approach ( i ) and beyond the case of non  rotating turbulence , all results derived in the framework of approach ( iib ) have to be considered with caution .",
    "their details are in general not correct .",
    "if we admit a coriolis force , that is @xmath213 , or a mean motion , @xmath363 , there is a coupling between the symmetric and antisymmetic parts of @xmath291 , and the calculation of @xmath316 is more complex . by the reason already discussed in section [ subsubseciia2 ] it is then hard to imagine that an extension of approach ( iib ) to the case @xmath213 can describe , e.g. , the  @xmath276effect \" correctly . here a view on the  @xmath276dynamo \" is of some interest .",
    "its existence depends on a non  zero value of a specific coefficient . in @xcite ,",
    "equations ( 130 ) and ( 132 ) , it is given by @xmath364 , and for hydrodynamic background turbulence it is non  zero as long as @xmath365 depends on @xmath334 . according to the calculations by @xcite done again for hydrodynamic background turbulence and in the second  order correlation approximation , however , this value vanishes in both the limits @xmath102 and @xmath104 independent of any assumption on the correlation time ; see section  vd and appendix  c of that paper .",
    "@xcite , considering a mean motion and proceeding in the spirit of approach ( iib ) , found a contribution to @xmath4 proportional to @xmath366 , where @xmath367 stands for @xmath368 .",
    "a contribution which can be interpreted in that sense occurs already in a paper by @xcite , though as a result of a not easily comprehensible calculation .",
    "the existence of this ",
    "@xmath369effect \" has been confirmed in the framework of the second  order correlation approximation by @xcite . the simple model of an  @xmath369dynamo \" proposed by @xcite ( see also rogachevskii and kleeorin 2004 ) works with the coefficients determining this and the accompanying effects as calculated in the spectral @xmath3approximation .",
    "it turned out however that it fails to work with the coefficients resulting from the second  order correlation approximation for purely hydrodynamic background turbulence , and this applies independently of @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "quite naturally the question arises whether the correctness or the limits of validity of the @xmath3approaches can be checked by means of direct numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , @xcite report on numerical experiments with forced helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in a rectangular box aimed at studying the @xmath29effect and @xmath29quenching in the framework of approach ( iia ) . in the underlying theory",
    "they use the ansatz ( [ eq317 ] ) for @xmath229 ( in their notation @xmath370 ) , standing for triple correlations , but ignore @xmath228 , which comprises the effects of viscous and ohmic dissipation and the correlation of the magnetic fluctuations with the external force .",
    "brandenburg and subramanian examined the relation between @xmath229 and a dynamo  generated mean field @xmath21 on the basis of a simulation with a forcing yielding an isotropic background turbulence . under the assumption of the proportionality of @xmath4 and @xmath21 , justified by a weak spatial variation of @xmath21 ,",
    "the result turned out to be consistent with the ansatz ( [ eq317 ] ) for @xmath229 .",
    "the simulation confirmed not only the proportionality of @xmath229 and @xmath4 , which was due to the isotropy of the turbulence to be expected already by symmetry reasons , but delivered also a non  negative @xmath235 .",
    "the ansatz ( [ eq317 ] ) for @xmath228 , which was not considered in this work , is plausible by symmetry reasons , too .",
    "so under the considered circumstances the neglect of a non ",
    "zero @xmath228 can not have any other consequence in the result for @xmath29 than a deviation of the time @xmath240 from @xmath235 .    in",
    "a further step brandenburg and subramanian extracted the time @xmath240 ( in their notation @xmath3 ) from the simulations by making use of the relation ( [ eq325 ] ) for @xmath29 .",
    "of course , using ( [ eq325 ] ) instead of ( [ eq327 ] ) has generally to be questioned as only the latter is the relevant one beyond the limit @xmath254 .",
    "the use of ( [ eq325 ] ) can only be justified under the additional assumption that @xmath371 and @xmath372 are proper proxies of @xmath373 and @xmath277 . in some cases , from the simulations",
    "negative values of @xmath240 emerged ( surprisingly enough just for small @xmath21 ) , what is in contradiction with the idea of a mean electromotive force decaying in the absence of a mean magnetic field . as a way  out an ad - hoc modification of ( [ eq325 ] )",
    "was introduced in form of additional quenching functions , @xmath374 and @xmath375 , in front of both the kinetic and the magnetic contributions to @xmath29 .",
    "this measure can not be brought into accordance with the derivation of ( [ eq325 ] ) , which allows at best the same quenching function for both contributions , that is , a dependence of @xmath240 on @xmath252 .",
    "interestingly enough , in the relations ( [ eq297 ] ) and ( [ eq303 ] ) for @xmath29 , derived in approach ( i ) for magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence in the limit @xmath205 , the two times @xmath208 and @xmath209 occur , which could be well different from each other . as far as the assumption of magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence , that is , of a small - scale dynamo , is justified , the numerical results support our doubt in the correctness of approach ( iia ) based on the conflict of the latter with approach ( i ) .",
    "it is however not clear to us whether all runs correspond to this assumption . in the case of a purely hydrodynamic background turbulence",
    "there is still another doubt in relation ( [ eq325 ] ) for @xmath29 , which results also from the comparison with approach ( i ) and concerns the existence of the magnetic contribution to @xmath29 ( see section  [ subsubseciia2 ] ) .",
    "let us for a moment deviate from approach ( iia ) and accept the concept employing the two quenching functions @xmath374 and @xmath375 . in order to get enough constraints for their unambiguous determination results of simulations with different",
    "( kinetic and magnetic ) forcings were employed .",
    "this seems to be again questionable , as only the structures of relations like ( [ eq325 ] ) or ( [ eq327 ] ) can be considered as universal in their validity ranges , but not the specific values of @xmath240 or of @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "these values should in general differ for different realizations of turbulence . as a consequence",
    ", they can at best be determined using data from one and the same simulation or from simulations which are equivalent on the level of mean quantities .",
    "examining the visualizations of the employed realizations of turbulence given in @xcite ( figures 10 and 11 ) it is by no means clear whether this requirement is fulfilled .",
    "but even if so , an unambiguous determination of the two quenching factors were then again impossible because the relevant equations ( 17 ) of that paper would just become linearly dependent .    in view of some support of approach ( iia ) from numerical studies we mention also the investigations of @xcite and @xcite on the saturation of a mean  field dynamo .",
    "specific results on helicities obtained in this approach , even if using a relation for @xmath29 like ( [ eq325 ] ) instead of one like ( [ eq327 ] ) , are surprisingly well matched to those of numerical simulations by @xcite , which are independent of such an approach .    summing up , we state that a convincing numerical support of the @xmath3approach still requires further efforts beyond the work published so far .    in this",
    "context studies of the behavior of passive scalars in a turbulent fluid carried out by @xcite and by @xcite using the @xmath3approach , too , deserve some interest .",
    "numerical simulations confirm the results derived in the framework of this approximation rather well .",
    "this is remarkable since the discussed concerns with respect to the treatment of the kinetic forcing term ( see section  [ seciibc3 ] ) apply here , too .",
    "as explained above approach ( i ) is based on approximative solutions of the induction equation ( [ eq107 ] ) for @xmath2 .",
    "the approximation is defined by the restriction to second  order correlations in the velocity fluctuations @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to this in the approaches ( ii ) neither the induction equation nor the momentum equation are really solved .",
    "instead simple assumptions are used for some crucial quantities .",
    "these assumptions , however , have proved to be very problematic .",
    "we believe that a real progress in the calculation of the mean electromotive force @xmath4 beyond the second  order correlation approximation can only be gained on the basis of improved solutions of the induction equation ( [ eq107 ] ) . in the expressions for @xmath4",
    "obtained in this way the quantities depending on @xmath1 can then be specified according to the momentum equation .",
    "as is well known it is possible to proceed from the second  order correlation approximation for the mean electromotive force @xmath4 to higher  order approximations @xcite .",
    "basically arbitrarily high orders can be reached .",
    "it has been shown that the proposed procedure converges @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of @xmath4 in a higher  order approximation requires the knowledge of higher  order correlation tensors and is moreover very tedious .",
    "that is why so far only in a few simple cases higher  order results have been given ( e.g. , nicklaus and stix 1988 , carvalho 1992 , 1994 , rdler _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .    in appendix  [ app5 ]",
    "a procedure is described for the calculation of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in higher  order correlation approximations . for the sake of simplicity",
    "it is restricted to cases with @xmath26 and @xmath198 .",
    "it turns out that then @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be represented in the simple form @xmath376 the quantities @xmath377 and @xmath378 are given as sums of constituents @xmath379 and @xmath380 , where @xmath42 is the order in @xmath1 .",
    "recursions for the calculation of @xmath379 from @xmath381 and of @xmath380 from @xmath382 are available , see appendix  [ app5 ] .",
    "let us add a remark concerning @xmath68 . as explained above , equation ( [ eq107 ] ) for @xmath2 in its original form , that is , without the neglect of @xmath17 , with a properly specified @xmath1 may have non  decaying solutions even if @xmath21 is equal to zero .",
    "then @xmath68 may be unequal to zero . as already noted in section  [ subsubsec311 ] in the second  order correlation approximation , when ignoring the influence of the initial @xmath2 , no such solutions @xmath2 exist and therefore @xmath68 vanishes .",
    "hence , if we start from the second  order approximation and proceed then to higher approximations we never find @xmath68 , though it may well be non  zero . in that sense ,",
    "the iteration procedure is not complete .      instead of approaches of type ( ii ) to the mean electromotive force @xmath4 we propose another one .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves again to the case @xmath26 and ignore the influence of any initial value of @xmath2 , that is , consider the limit @xmath79",
    ". then equation ( [ eq107 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath383 this leads immediately to @xmath384 we write for short @xmath385 where @xmath386 is the result for @xmath4 obtained in the second  order correlation approximation , that is , with ( [ eq403 ] ) if there the part of the integrand with @xmath387 is ignored , and @xmath388 the contribution to @xmath4 defined by this part .    our proposal for a new approach to @xmath4 consists in its simplest form in putting @xmath389 with some factor @xmath11 , which will be discussed below .",
    "then we have @xmath390    the ansatz ( [ eq407 ] ) corresponds in a formal sense to the ansatzes ( [ eq317 ] ) or ( [ eq363 ] ) used in the approaches ( ii ) . as the time @xmath240 in these cases ,",
    "the factor @xmath11 remains at first undetermined . in order to find rough statements or estimates for the factor @xmath11",
    "a look on the results of higher  order approximations reported above is useful .",
    "these results suggest that , e.g. , in the limit @xmath102 the factor @xmath11 has the form @xmath391 with some positive @xmath392 for small @xmath91 , and @xmath393 for higher @xmath91 . in the limit @xmath104 the factor @xmath11 should have the form @xmath394 for small @xmath92 , and the form @xmath395 for higher @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath396 as @xmath101 or @xmath397 , respectively , the ansatz ( [ eq407 ] ) trivially satisfies the requirement that higher approaches should include the second  order correlation approximation in overlapping parts of their respective validity regions .    in this context",
    "the @xmath29effect calculations for the karlsruhe experiment are of particular interest @xcite .",
    "they have been done for the case @xmath26 and steady flows @xmath1 , that is @xmath398 , with arbitrary @xmath91 .",
    "the flows have the form @xmath399 , where @xmath400 and @xmath401 are , with respect to a proper cartesian coordinate system @xmath402 , defined by @xmath403 and @xmath404 , and are periodic in @xmath405 and @xmath406 .",
    "two different magnetic reynolds numbers @xmath407 and @xmath408 are introduced characterizing the magnitudes of @xmath400 and @xmath401 , respectively . if the flow described by @xmath1 shows helical structures as , e.g. , in the case of the so  called roberts flow , an @xmath29-effect occurs such that @xmath409 , with some coefficient @xmath410 , and @xmath411 defined analogously to @xmath400 ; contributions to @xmath4 with derivatives of @xmath21 are here ignored . in the second  order correlation approximation",
    "the result for @xmath410 , in this case called @xmath412 , reads @xmath413 , with some @xmath414 depending on the geometrical properties but not on the magnitude of the flow . in the general case",
    "it turns out that @xmath415 with the same @xmath414 as before .",
    "the function @xmath144 satisfies @xmath416 , decays monotonically with growing @xmath407 and tends to zero as @xmath417 ; further properties and numerical values of @xmath144 are given in some of the papers mentioned @xcite . when writing in the sense of ( [ eq409 ] ) @xmath418 we have @xmath419 and therefore @xmath396 as @xmath420 and @xmath421 if @xmath417 .",
    "the paper provides a critical view on different analytical ways to determine the mean electromotive force @xmath4 in mean  field electrodynamics .",
    "first some of the findings gained with the traditional approach , reduced to the second  order correlation approximation or approach ( i ) , are summarized ( section  [ seci ] ) . in this context",
    "also some new results concerning the case of magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence are given ( section  [ subsec32 ] ) .",
    "then the essentials of two versions of the @xmath3approach , or approach ( ii ) , are represented , that is , of the simple @xmath3approach , or approach ( iia ) , as used by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and of the spectral @xmath3approach , or approach ( iib ) , used by @xcite and by @xcite ( section  [ secii ] ) .    approach ( i ) in its original form , applying to purely hydrodynamic background turbulence , is based on solutions of the induction equation for the fluctuations @xmath2 simplified by some approximation . in the case of magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence in addition solutions of the momentum balance for @xmath1 , again in some approximation , are used . in the approaches",
    "( ii ) these equations are not really solved . instead",
    ", some assumptions on crucial quantities are introduced .",
    "there is hardly any doubt in the correctness of the results of approach ( i ) in the range of its applicability , which is well defined at least by sufficient conditions .",
    "it is not surprising that the approaches ( ii ) deliver the same vectorial structures of the contributions to @xmath4 as approach ( i ) , for these are already determined by elementary symmetry principles .",
    "the results of the two types of approaches differ however in the dependence of the coefficients of the individual contributions to @xmath4 on the correlation properties of the velocity fluctuations @xmath1 .",
    "the discrepancies of the two approaches as well as strange aspects or shortcomings of the approaches ( ii ) are discussed in detail ( sections  [ subsubseciia2 ] and [ seciibc3 ] ) .",
    "unless any overlap of the ranges of applicability of the approaches ( i ) and ( ii ) can be excluded , what would be very surprising , we have to conclude that the approaches ( ii ) are in some conflict with the basic equations and not all of their results can be taken for granted .",
    "for instance , the magnetic contribution to the @xmath29effect occurs in the approaches ( ii ) not only in the case of a magnetohydrodynamic background turbulence but for purely hydrodynamic background turbulence , too , where they should not exist .",
    "in addition , in the first case it is the same  correlation time \" which occurs with the kinetic and the magnetic contributions , what seems to be in conflict with numerical simulations ( section  [ subsec43 ] ) .",
    "further the dependence of @xmath29 and @xmath30 on the magnetic diffusivity @xmath8 and the kinematic viscosity @xmath42 which occurs in approach ( iib ) is not correct .",
    "moreover , it is doubtful whether the approaches ( ii ) can describe , e.g. , the @xmath276effect correctly .",
    "there is no hint that the mentioned shortcomings of the approaches ( ii ) result from the @xmath3approximation , that is , the reduction of third  order correlations of @xmath1 or @xmath2 to second  order ones .",
    "an important reason for them seems to be an improper treatment of a term connected with the forcing term in the momentum balance .",
    "a proposal is made for a new approach which avoids any conflict with approach ( i ) ( section  [ new ] ) . in this context also a new formalism for the higher  order correlation approximation is presented ( section  [ new1 ] ) .",

    "we have argued there with very specific properties of the turbulence , that is of @xmath1 .",

    "consider any function @xmath496 .",
    "assume that the integral @xmath497 has a non - zero finite value .",
    "assume further that the integral @xmath498 , with any weight function @xmath499 , has a non  zero finite value , too .",
    "clearly the magnitude of a given @xmath499 can be fixed such that @xmath500 there is , of course , some freedom in the choice of the dependence of @xmath499 on @xmath128 .",
    "we may determine a specific @xmath499 , e.g. , after the pattern of appendix  [ app2 ] .",
    "for this purpose we introduce the fourier transform @xmath501 of @xmath9 with respect to @xmath128 and put @xmath502 . integrating both sides of this relation over all @xmath473 and using the convolution theorem we arrive just at ( @xmath503 ) , with @xmath504 such that its fourier transform is equal to @xmath505 .",
    "let us first identify @xmath9 in relation ( @xmath503 ) with @xmath506 or @xmath124 .",
    "then we arrive without utilizing specific properties of the turbulence at relations which allow us to rewrite the results ( [ eq241 ] ) for @xmath29 and @xmath30 into ( [ eq519 ] ) and ( [ eq523 ] ) . in the same way we may rewrite the more general results ( [ eq227 ] ) for @xmath114 and @xmath115 such that , as in ( [ eq381 ] ) , only correlations of components of @xmath1 at the same time and only integrals over @xmath128 occur .",
    "this finding extenuates our statement made in section  [ seciibc3 ] on the discrepancy between the results ( [ eq227 ] ) of approach ( i ) and the results ( [ eq381 ] ) of approach ( iib ) .",
    "however , it probably not even completely resolves the part of the discrepancy resulting from the different types of correlations and different types of integrals : so it is hard to imagine that all integrals in ( [ eq227 ] ) over correlations of @xmath1 can be rewritten as integrals over @xmath128 with one and the same @xmath499 , which would have then to be identified with the @xmath240 that occurs in ( [ eq381 ] ) ."
