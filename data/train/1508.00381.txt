    "series expansions in terms of small physical parameters are a common way of dealing with dynamical models in celestial mechanics .",
    "one case where this approach has been extensively used is the problem of trojan motion .",
    "the so - called trojan stability problem , i.e. the study of the long - term dynamics for massless particles in the neighborhood of the equilateral lagrangian points , has been studied both analytically and numerically in several contexts .    from the numerical point of view , quite complete models ( including extra planets perturbations and/or 3-dimensional configurations ) are possible to consider .",
    "such experiments are in general based on accurate long integrations , done through high precision integrators .",
    "a clear outcome is the determination of size and shape of the stable domain around the equilibrium points .",
    "secondary resonances embedded within the domain of the 1:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) are of particular importance in the stability issue . for example , in  @xcite and  @xcite , the importance of the resonance web is highlighted for what concerns the process of de - population of the trojan domain , in the case of jupiter s asteroids . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors study the orbital stability of the only discovered trojan asteroid of the earth , i.e.  2010 tk7 , and determine the stability region around l4 and l5 in the sun - earth system .",
    "besides pure numerical investigations , several works have also explored the applicability of analytical methods in the problem of trojan stability . in particular ,",
    "the trojan problem has served as a classical model for testing methods based on the construction of a so - called _",
    "hamiltonian normal form _ approach .",
    "semi - analytic methods share a common structure : each method is based on an explicit algorithm , possible , as a rule , to translate into a programming code , which computes the expansion of a suitable _ normal form _ that provides some special solutions .",
    "therefore , a normal form is a good _ local _ approximation to the complete hamiltonian , used to reproduce the orbits of particular objects .",
    "normal forms have been used in several cases for computing the size and shape of the stability domain . from the point of view of",
    "nekhoroshev stability estimates @xcite,@xcite , examples of this computation are in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , in  @xcite , the stability estimation is induced by applying the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) theory . but all these approaches , while introducing novel and promising features , tend to fail when it comes to reproduce the numerical results about the size and shape of the whole stability region . in general , they are able to justify stability for just a small subset of trojan orbits , located relatively close to the equilibrium point .    in the present work ,",
    "we develop a new normal form approach to the classical pcrtbp by combining three main ideas .",
    "first , we make an accurate choice of variables for the representation of the system .",
    "second , we explicitly take benefit of the existence of a slow and a fast degree of freedom , dealing with them differently in our normal form construction . finally , we make use of lie series techniques for the averaging over the fast angle ; in fact , as shown below , a key element of our method is that such a treatment makes possible to overcome the only true singularity that the trojan motion contains , namely the eventual _ close encounters _ with the primary .",
    "we motivate these ideas as follows .",
    "many of previous attemps describe the system in terms of cartesian coordinates , which however do not capture properly the _ physical configuration _ of the model . considering canonical variables",
    "well adapted to the system helps to improve the accuracy of the normal form and the estimation of stability domains . to this end , in the present paper , we adopt ( and show the usefulness of ) a modified version of delaunay - like coordinates introduced long ago in  @xcite .",
    "regarding the other two ideas , an important point is that the only real physical singularity in the 1:1 mmr region is due to possible collisions  /  close encounters of the trojan body with the primary . in our setting of modified delaunay - like variables ( see definition  [ eq : delaunay - coord ] ) , this singularity takes place at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the _ synodic mean longitude _ of the massless body .",
    "thus , any polynomial expansion around the equilibrium point , exhibits a bad convergence behavior for orbits approaching this singularity .",
    "nevertheless , in this work we show this problem can be overcome in a rather simple way .",
    "this is based on the following remarks .    on one hand , as noted already , an inspection of the main terms of the hamiltonian for a trojan body , indicates that the motion is ruled by a fast and a slow frenquency . in delaunay variables ,",
    "these two dynamics are represented by two independent pairs of canonical coordinates . however , the long term behavior of the orbits depends essentially only on the slow degree of freedom which , in our variables , corresponds to the canonical pair including the angle @xmath1 . in other words ,",
    "an appropriate normal form construction that aims to study the long term dynamics involves averaging over the fast angle only .",
    "this produces an _",
    "integrable _ hamiltonian of two degrees of freedom in which the fast angle is ignorable .    on the other hand ,",
    "such an averaging implies that one has to solve a so - called homological equation in which @xmath1 plays no role . as shown in section 2 below , due to this property",
    ", one can retain in the hamiltonian a complicated functional dependence on @xmath1 , other than trigonometric or simply polynomial . in our case",
    "this dependence turns to be of the form of powers of the quantity @xmath2 .",
    "thus , using this technique allows to greatly extend the convergence domain of the _ final _ normal form .",
    "finally , we develop a new normalization algorithm for the computation of the integrable approximation , by using the lie series formalism , adapting to a modern way the technique described in  @xcite . with this integrable normal form",
    ", we can approximate trojan orbits having either tadpole or horseshoe shapes , even in cases where distances from the equilateral point become large and where previous approaches tend to fail .",
    "there are several different examples where such a normalizing scheme can be applied .",
    "the most evident corresponds to the use of the scheme for the estimation of the stability domain .",
    "such a computation , in the same direction as the references mentioned before , aim to estimate the effects induced by the remainder @xmath3 ( in later eq .  [ eq : h(r1,r2 ) ] ) of the normal form produced by the algorithm . according to our results",
    ", our novel normalization may radically improve the results regarding the size of the domain of stability around the equilateral lagrangian points , understimated so far .",
    "other examples inherent directly to the normal form can be mentioned .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite , we used the normalized coordinates for the design and optimization of maneuvers aiming to transfer a spacecraft into the tadpole region .",
    "moreover , the numerical experiments described in the present work highlight that our method allows to clearly differentiate the tadpole region from the horseshoe region . in some cases , when the mass ratio between the two primary bodies is very small and consequently also the chaotic regions are small , such a computation gives a first order estimation of the stable tadpole domain . on the other hand",
    ", this kind of perturbative approach is motivating for problems of diverse nature .",
    "for instance , in  @xcite , they make use of the relegation algorithm , that shares a similar structure with our normalizing scheme , to compute some particular orbits around an irregularly shaped asteroid .    this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : expl_alg ] , we describe the expansion and normalization scheme , applied to the case of the pcrtbp hamiltonian , in the 1:1 mmr region ; in section  [ sec : results_sect ] , we provide different tests for a suitable accuracy verification of the normal form , involving comparisons with the numerical integration of the full problem ; in section  [ sec : concl_future ] , we summarize the work and outline future applications of this method .",
    "furthermore , appendix  [ sec : techn_things ] formally presents the algorithm in such a way that it can be adapted also to different models , for example , the elliptic restricted three body problem ( ertbp ) or the restricted multiplanet problem ( rmpp ) , described in  @xcite .",
    "in heliocentric canonical variables @xmath4 , the hamiltonian of the pcrtbp can be written as : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of the larger and smaller primary , respectively , @xmath8 is the heliocentric position vector of the test particle , @xmath9 the one corresponding to the second primary , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in",
    "what follows , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath6 and @xmath16 symbolize the major semi - axis , the eccentricity , the mean anomaly and the longitude of the perihelion ( primed quantities correspond to the primary ) .",
    "we set the unit of length as @xmath17 , and the unit of time such that the mean motion of the primary is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "this implies @xmath19 .",
    "the unit of mass is set so as to @xmath20 .",
    "defining the mass parameter as @xmath21 , the hamiltonian in the above units takes the form : @xmath22 where the so  called disturbing function @xmath23 is such that @xmath24 including the small keplerian correction @xmath25 in the disturbing function allows to define action - angle variables with values independent of the mass parameter @xmath26 .",
    "inspired by  @xcite and references therein , we introduce modified delaunay action - angle variables @xmath27 according to the definitions of the orbital elements above , @xmath1 is the _",
    "_ s__ynodic mean longitude . in order to remove the _ fictitious _ singularity of the delaunay  like variables when @xmath28 ( i.e. , for circular orbits )",
    ", it is convenient to introduce canonical coordinates @xmath29 , similar to poincar coordinates for the _ planar keplerian problem_. thus , let us define @xmath30 where the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are significantly small in a region surrounding the triangular lagrangian points , for instance , in the case of tadpole or horseshoe orbits ( since @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "let us recall that those variables have been introduced in  @xcite to study the pcrtbp .    before starting the construction of the normal form",
    ", it is necessary to express hamiltonian  , in particular the disturbing function @xmath36 in  , in terms of poincar  delaunay  like coordinates @xmath29 . here , we limit ourselves to sketch this preliminary procedure . essentially , as a first step , the terms @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( appearing in the hamiltonian ) must be expanded with respect to orbital elements @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 , following e.g.  6 in @xcite . afterwards , the eccentricity @xmath41 is replaced by its expansion in power series of the parameter @xmath42 . by using the equations @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , we can then express @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 as functions of the canonical variables  .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the particular normalizing scheme we use allows to keep a non polynomial nor trigonometric functional dependence with @xmath1 . by making use of this idea ,",
    "we keep powers of @xmath46 , in the expansions of the term @xmath47 of @xmath36 , which describes the main part of the inverse of the distance from the primary ( for values of the major semi - axis @xmath48 and small eccentricity ) .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian ruling the motion of the third body takes the following form , in terms of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath31 , that corresponds to @xmath49 . ]",
    "@xmath50 where @xmath51 are rational numbers .",
    "actually , we just produce a truncated expansion of formula   up to a finite polynomial degree in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , by using mathematica . by inspection , we check that both properties @xmath52 and @xmath53 are satisfied in our initial expansion , and we just _ conjecture _ that they hold true also to any following polynomial degree in @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( being such a proof beyond of the scopes of this work ) .",
    "let us focus on the first main terms of the keplerian part : @xmath54 ^ 2 + \\ldots\\ , = \\",
    ", -\\frac{3}{2}+\\gamma-\\frac{3}{2}(\\rho+\\gamma)^2 + \\ldots\\ , \\label{eq : quadr - part - kepl - appr}\\ ] ] where we refer to the dynamics of the new canonical coordinates @xmath55 by retaining the old action ",
    "angle pair @xmath56 , that allow us to sketch our strategy in a simpler way .",
    "indeed , the previous formula shows that the angular velocities have different order of magnitude @xmath57 because @xmath58 and the values of the actions @xmath31 and @xmath59 are small in a region surrounding the lagrangian points .",
    "thus , @xmath1 can be seen as a slow angle and @xmath60 as a fast angle . this motivates to average the hamiltonian over the fast angle ( see , e.g.,  52 of @xcite ) , in order to focus mainly on the secular evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , we want remove ( most of ) the terms depending on the fast angle @xmath60 , that can be conveniently done in the setting of the variables @xmath29 , by performing a sequence of canonical transformations . in the following , this strategy is translated in an explicit algorithm using lie series , by adapting to the present context an approach that has been fruitfully applied to various problems in celestial mechanics ( for instance , for locating the elliptic lower - dimensional tori in a rather realistic four - body planetary model in  @xcite , or studying the secular behavior of the orbital elements of extrasolar planets in  @xcite ) . by applying such a procedure to our hamiltonian model",
    ", we construct an average normal form , satisfying two important properties : ( i )  it provides an accurate approximation of the starting model ; ( ii )  it only depends on the actions and one of the angles and , therefore , it is integrable .",

    "for both cases , the points of the surface of section are represented in blue ( dark gray ) and the curves produced with the averaged hamiltonian are in red ( light gray ) . for the case of sun - earth system",
    "the agreement between the two representations is excellent . according to the milestones we define at the beginning of this section",
    ", the averaged hamiltonian reproduces accurately the large variations of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , it is perfectly able to distinguish between orbits belonging to the tadpole or to the horseshoe region . in the case sun - jupiter system ,",
    "for which the mass parameter value is 3 orders of magnitude larger , there is a substantial presence of chaos .",
    "nevertheless , the averaged hamiltonian is able to _ locate _ any tadpole orbit provided by the complete hamiltonian , even in cases when the motion is trapped into secondary resonances , and its validity is also good for orbits close to the border of the stable region .",
    "so far in the literature , one the most successful attemps to construct a normal form for testing the stability of trojans in the context of the hamiltonian formalism is discussed in  @xcite . however , of the 34 initial conditions they used for the system sun - jupiter , 4 presented orbits that were highly chaotic after being translated according their rotations into the planar crtbp , while the kolmogorov normalization algorithm defined in that work did not work properly for other 7 cases . here",
    ", we revisit the fictitious initial conditions they considered for these latter seven asteroids ( 1868  thersites , 1872  helenos , 2146  stentor , 2207  antenor , 2363  cebriones , 2674  pandarus and 2759  idomeneus ) . since they conform a set of coordinates that either lay very close to the border of stability or show an anomalous behavior ( with respect to the expected tadpole orbit ) , they provide a natural harder test in a more quantitative way .    in the previous subsection",
    ", we show that the evolution of the orbits given by @xmath112 emulates correctly in many cases the evolution under the original non - normalized hamiltonian , by means of graphical comparisons between level curves and surfaces of section .",
    "this normal form @xmath112 contains two different actions or integrals of motion .",
    "one , obtained by construction and through the normalization , is given by @xmath59 .",
    "the other one , not explicitly obtained , is due to the fact that , after the reduction of @xmath59 , the normal form bear just 1 d.o.f .",
    ", i.e. it is integrable .",
    "this second constant of motion is associated with the area enclosed by the level curve computed under the integration of @xmath112 , and therefore , provide another quantity to be checked . in order to do so ,",
    "the computation of the orbits is done as explained in subsections  [ sss : surf_sec][sss : examples_results ] , but for just one initial condition . after integrating both curves , we compute the maximum and minimum values for the two variables @xmath31 and @xmath1 reached during the integration . in fig .  [",
    "fig : strg_guy ] , we show the positions of those quantities , over the surfaces of section defined in subsection  [ sbs : graph_test ] . with those values ,",
    "first we obtain the positions of the centers for the two orbits through     and @xmath1 in the integration of the fictitious initial condition associated to 1872 helenos , around l5 .",
    "red ( light gray ) points correspond to the averaged level curve and blue ( dark gray ) points to the numerical surface of section ]    @xmath189    and @xmath190 the dispersion between centers , which shows how much displacement there is between the orbits , is evaluated by putting @xmath191 furthermore , we obtain the value of the enclosed areas for each curve , as follows : we first refer all the points composing the curve , to the already computed center , by introducing the quantities @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; therefore , we obtain the distance to the center @xmath194 and the angle @xmath195 with respect to the horizontal line ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "re - ordering the points by increasing value for the angle @xmath195 , we compute the area contained in the triangle generated by two consecutive points and the center . the sum along all the triangles represents the contained area within each curve , @xmath197 for the complete system and @xmath198 for average hamiltonian flow . for a further comparison , we compute also the relative difference between the areas @xmath199 , and the displacement of the centers of the orbits with respect to the position of the equilateral lagrangian point they librate around ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 for @xmath202 and @xmath203 for @xmath204 ) .",
    ".summary of the results for the quantities defining each averaged and numerical orbit [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for 6 of the 7 cases mentioned above , we are able to obtain averaged orbits that reflects the behavior of the numerical integrations . in table",
    "[ tab : table_data ] , where we report the results for the previously defined quantities , we show that the averaged areas clearly match their associated numerical areas , with a relative error smaller than 2% , except for one case ( asteroid 2146 stentor ) , for which the error is about 13% .",
    "this may be due to the fact that 2146 stentor presents the largest displacement with respect to the corresponding lagrangian point , in a quite anomalous orbit .",
    "for the rest of the asteroids , the position of the orbits in the surface of section turns to be very close to that generated by the equivalent averaged level curve , both centered at a triangular lagrangian point . on the other hand , in table 1 we do not present data for the highly inclined ( @xmath205 ) asteroid 2363  cebriones of our sample . for this asteroid , our normal form fails to provide an accurate orbit , using the initial conditions provided in  @xcite .",
    "however , we find that the numerical orbit generated by 2363  cebriones presents a very peculiar angular excursion ( in @xmath1 ) with respect to the lagrangian point .",
    "this failure of the normal form could be generated in the initial condition by a non - consistent rotation to the plane of the primaries , in the original work .",
    "in this paper we present a novel normalization scheme , that provides an integrable approximation of the dynamics of a trojan asteroid hamiltonian in the framework of the planar circular restricted three - body problem ( pcrtbp ) .",
    "this new algorithm is based on three co - related points : the introduction of a set of variables which respects the physical configuration of the system ; the existence of two degrees of freedom with well distinguishable roles , one corresponding to a fast motion and another corresponding to a slow motion , that allows us to fruitfully average over the fast angle ; finally , the analytic singularity of this model exclusively related with the slow angle .",
    "these three concepts motivates a new way to deal with the initial expansion of the hamiltonian , as it is necessary for the normalization procedure .",
    "the slow angle @xmath1 does not affect the solution of the homological equation , determined in order to remove the dependence on the fast angle .",
    "thus , we are able to carefully approximate level curves that represent tadpole and horseshoe orbits by keeping , in the expansions , a non polynomial dependence just with respect to @xmath1 .    in order to examinate the accuracy of the normal form produced , we develop some tests . we study numerically integrated surfaces of section , along the flow of the complete hamiltonian , and we contrast them with the level curves provided by our integrable normal form , with very good agreement",
    ". furthermore , we estimate some quasi - integrals of motion ( by computation of enclosed areas ) , which also show excellent agreement with those corresponding to the numerically computed surfaces of section . on the whole , this novel approach for producing a new normal form results in a very promising approximation of the global behavior of the trojans motion .    from a rather theoretical point of view",
    ", we think that our normalizing scheme can be complemented with a scheme of estimates , so as to make the remainder exponentially small on a suitable open domain .",
    "if our algorithm is joint with a nekhoroshev - like approach , it should ensure that the eventual diffusion is effectively bounded ( i.e. , for intervals of time comparable with the age of our solar system ) , for a set of initial conditions .",
    "we expect such a set to be significantly larger than those considered in the works already existing in the literature .",
    "this expectation is due to the fact that our method offers a wide coverage of the trojans orbits .",
    "for the same reason , we think that our integrable approximation can be used in many cases to successfully start the kolmogorov normalization algorithm . while the corresponding solution is valid for any time , the construction of an invariant kam torus is an extremely local procedure , because it must be adapted to the orbit of each trojan body to be studied . in this context",
    ", we think that our algorithm can be efficiently used jointly with a kam - like approach in those cases for which the previous implementation of the kolmogorov normalization algorithm failed .",
    "let us remark that such a new application of the kam theory would require to preliminarly construct the action ",
    "angle coordinates also for the slow degree of freedom , before starting the final normalization procedure . as an alternative strategy ,",
    "a different formulation of the kam theorem that is not strictly based on action  angle variables could be used  @xcite .",
    "more practically , in our opinion the most exciting point is that our method is suitable to be translated to more complex models , without requiring essential changes .",
    "since the pcrtbp corresponds to a very simplistic representation for the trojans domain , we are presently working to extend the normalization to a hamiltonian that also considers the eccentricity of the primary .",
    "the first preliminary results show that our method can be used so as to locate the main secondary resonances within the 1:1 mmr region .",
    "in particular , we find a good agreement with other purely numerical indicators , when the mass ratio between the primaries is small .",
    "we plan to include these and other results in a future publication .",
    "furthermore , we think that our present and future contributions will help to fill that still existing gap between the semi - analytic studies and the more complete numerical experiments of the stability region .",
    "the authors would like to thank c.  efthymiopoulos for his advice and constant support .",
    "we are indebted also with c.  sim who suggested to reconsider the article  @xcite , and with the anonymous referee , whose contribution helped improving the original manuscript . during this work , r.i.p .",

    "as discussed in subsection  [ sbs : average ] , the normalization algorithm defines a sequence of hamiltonians .",
    "this is done by an iterative procedure ; let us describe the basic step which introduces @xmath71 starting from @xmath206 when both the values of the indexes @xmath65 and @xmath108 are positive .",
    "we assume that the expansions of @xmath206 is such that @xmath207 where @xmath73 @xmath74 , @xmath75 @xmath76 , @xmath77 @xmath208 , @xmath209 @xmath210 , @xmath211 @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "let us recall that the hamiltonian @xmath91 written in   is suitable for starting the procedure with @xmath212 . in formula  , one can distinguish the normal form terms from the perturbing part ; the latter depends on @xmath55 in a _ generic _ way , while in the terms of @xmath104 type appearing in   the fast variables can be replaced by the action @xmath213 .",
    "the @xmath70th step of the algorithm formally defines the new hamiltonian @xmath71 by applying the lie series operator @xmath214 to the previous hamiltonian @xmath206 , as it is prescribed in formula  .",
    "the new generating function @xmath215 is determined by solving the following homological equation with respect to the unknown @xmath98 : @xmath216 where we require that @xmath217 is the new term in normal form , i.e. @xmath218 .",
    "we limit ourselves to just sketch the procedure that can be followed so as to explicitly determine a solution of   and , therefore , prove the statement above .",
    "first , we replace the fast coordinates @xmath55 with the pair of complex conjugate canonical variables @xmath223 such that @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "moreover , the homological equation   has to be expanded in taylor series with respect to @xmath223 , using the slow coordinates @xmath226 as fixed parameters ( because they are not affected by the poisson bracket @xmath227 , since @xmath228 do not depend on them ) .",
    "therefore , we solve term - by - term the equation   in the unknown coefficients , depends just on the fast action @xmath144 . ] @xmath229 and @xmath230 such that @xmath231 and @xmath232 at last , we express the expansions above by replacing @xmath223 with @xmath55 , and we obtain the final solutions in the form @xmath98 and @xmath218 .        in order to provide an algorithm easy to translate in a programming language , we are going to give explicit formulas for the new terms of type @xmath105 appearing in expansion   of hamiltonian @xmath71 .",
    "let us introduce the recursive operation @xmath236 , where the previously defined quantity @xmath40 is redefined as @xmath237 .",
    "therefore , we initially define @xmath238 then , we consider the contribution of the terms generated by the lie series applied to each function belonging to the normal form part as follows : @xmath239 where the upper limits @xmath240 and @xmath241 on the indexes @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively , are such that @xmath244 for what concerns the contributions given by the perturbing terms making part of the expansion of @xmath206 in  , we have @xmath245 where the limiting values for the indexes , that are @xmath240 and @xmath246 , are defined in  .    the redefinition rules   and   are set so that the new perturbing part generated by the lie series in   is coherently split in different terms according to their order of magnitude in @xmath26 and their total polynomial degree in the actions .",
    "in fact , by applying repeatedly proposition  [ lem : alg - prop - pois - brackets ] to the redefinitions in   , it is possible to inductively verify that @xmath81 @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , the terms making part of the hamiltonian  @xmath71 in the expansion   share the same properties with those appearing in  ; this ensures that the normalization algorithm can be iterated so as to construct @xmath248 .",
    "the simple prescription @xmath95 , @xmath249 , allows to deal with generating functions of the next order of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath250 . as discussed in subsection  [ sbs : average ] , by applying repeatedly the rules of the generic normalization step , the algorithm finally ends , by determining the last hamiltonian @xmath127 ."
