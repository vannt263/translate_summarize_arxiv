    "type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ; see filippenko 1997 for a review of supernova classification ) are the thermonuclear runaway explosions of carbon / oxygen white dwarfs ( see , e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 for a review ) .",
    "they can be used as standardizable candles with many important applications , including measurements of the expansion rate of the universe ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "two general scenarios are favored as the progenitor system for sne  ia .",
    "one is the single - degenrate model ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ; hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ; meng et al . 2009 ; rpke et al . 2012 ) , which consists of a single white dwarf accreting material from a companion . the other is the double - degenerate scenario involving the merger of two white dwarfs ( webbink 1984 ; iben & tutukov 1984 ; pakmor et al . 2012 ; rpke et al . 2012 ) .",
    "however , our understanding of their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms remains substantially incomplete .",
    "very early discovery and detailed follow - up observations are essential for understanding those problems .",
    "for example , bloom et al .",
    "( 2012 ) were able to constrain the companion - star radius to be @xmath9 from an optical nondetection just 4hr after the explosion of sn  2011fe ( nugent et al .",
    "cao et al . ( 2015 ) found strong but declining ultraviolet emission in sn  ia iptf14atg in early - time _",
    "observations , consistent with theoretical expectations of the collision between supernova ( sn ) ejecta and a companion star ( kasen 2010 ) .",
    "i m et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found evidence of a  dark phase \" in sn  2015f , which can last for a few hours to days between the moment of explosion and the first observed light ( e.g. , rabinak , livne , & waxman 2012 ; piro & nakar 2013 , 2014 ) ; see also cao et al .",
    "( 2016 ) for the case of iptf14pdk .",
    "differences in the duration of the  dark phase \" could be caused by a varying distribution of @xmath10ni near the surface of a sn  ia .",
    "for example , piro & morozova ( 2016 ) show that it is short ( with a steep rise ) when the @xmath10ni is shallow , and longer ( with a more gradual rise ) when the @xmath10ni is deeper ( see their figure 7 ) .",
    "spectra of sne  ia not only reveal the ejecta composition from nuclear burning , but also provide a way to measure the ejecta expansion velocity .",
    "benetti et al .",
    "( 2005 ) separated sn  ia samples into different groups according to their velocity gradient and found that high - velocity - gradient objects tend to have a higher velocity of the @xmath36355 line near maximum light .",
    "nugent et al .",
    "( 1995 ) quantified the spectral diversity using line - strength ratios , finding a good correlation between the absorption - depth ratio of @xmath35972 to @xmath36355 ) and the brightness decline rate .",
    "wang et al .",
    "( 2009 ; 2013 ) and foley et al .",
    "( 2011a ) separated sne  ia into high - velocity and normal - velocity groups with a boundary at 11,800kms@xmath5 at peak brightness , and found that the former are @xmath11mag ( on average ) redder in @xmath12 than the latter .",
    "meanwhile , high - resolution spectral observations provide a powerful way to study absorption along the line of sight , both from the interstellar medium and circumstellar material .",
    "patat et al . (",
    "2007 ) found a complex of  d lines that showed evolution in sn  2006x ( wang et al .",
    "two additional cases of time - variable na absorption are provided by blondin et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and simon et al .",
    "sternberg et al . ( 2014 ) found that in their sample with high - resolution spectra , @xmath13% of sne  ia exhibit time - variable na , indicating the presence of circumstellar material and suggesting that it may be more common than expected in sne  ia , though some objects do not show evolution ( e.g. , sn  2014j ; graham et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry can be used to probe the geometry of sne  ia ( see wang & wheeler 2008 for a review ) .",
    "the continuum polarization , an indication of the photosphere s shape , was found to be quite low in sne  ia , on the order of a few tenths of a percent ( hflich 1991 ; wang et al .",
    "but for individual sne  ia , significant line polarization is sometimes observed ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "2003 ; kasen et al .",
    "wang et al . ( 2007 ) also found a correlation between the degree of polarization of @xmath36355 and the brightness decline rate .",
    "observationally , there are numerous efforts to discover sne  ia at very early times , which can benefit follow - up observations in many ways",

    "we find that the best @xmath48 model fit gives the first - light time to be mjd @xmath53 , around may 23.33 . here the uncertainty ( not including the  dark phase \" ) is estimated by calculating the reduced @xmath54 ratio with the minimum reduced @xmath54 at 90% confidence level , when @xmath46 changes around the best - fitted value while all the other parameters are fixed with the best - fitted value .",

    "therefore , there could be a systematic error of up to 1.0d from this method , which we did not include in the following analysis .",
    "our results show that the first detection ( from an image by r. arbour ) was merely @xmath2d after first light , or 0.9d from kait s first detection on may 24 .",

    "this means sn  2016coj was discovered only 4.9d after the fitted first light , or 11.1d before maximum light .",
    "the distance modulus of the host galaxy ngc  4125 is quite uncertain owing to different measurements given in ned .",
    "however , some of them are outdated , or adopted an inappropriate h@xmath62 value .",
    "the one with the smallest uncertainty ( and also the latest estimate ) is @xmath63mag ( tully et al .",
    "2013 ) , which was based on h@xmath64kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , quite close to the current widely accepted value of h@xmath65 .",
    "we therefore adopt this distance for the following ananlysis . with @xmath66mag ( schlafly et al . 2011 ) and",
    "very small ( even negligible ) host - galaxy extinction ( see  [ ss : spectra ] and  [ ss : highresspectra ] ) , this implies sn  2016coj has @xmath67mag at peak brightness .",
    "our preliminary measurement of @xmath1-band data , assuming the host background contamination is small , shows that the @xmath1-band peak is @xmath68mag and @xmath69mag .",
    "this gives @xmath70mag , but we expect @xmath71mag from the phillips ( 1993 ) relation with the above value of @xmath72 ; thus , sn  2016coj is a normal - brightness sn  ia .",
    "its @xmath69mag is also typical of normal sne  ia ( see also  [ ss : classification ] for the spectral classification ) .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of sn  2016coj nearly daily for a month ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spectra ] ) , sometimes obtaining multiple spectra in a given night .",
    "we first examine the  d absorption feature , which is often converted into reddening but with large scatter over the empirical relationship ( poznanski et al .",
    "2011 ) , in several of our high - s / n spectra .",
    "the absorption is not clearly detected at both the  d rest - frame wavelength and the redshifted wavelength of sn  2016coj .",
    "however , there appears to be a weak absorption feature consistent with the rest - frame  d wavelength .",
    "if real , this could be caused by a milky way component , which has @xmath66mag according to schlafly et al .",
    "since we do not detect similar absorption at the redshifted wavelength of sn  2016coj , we can put an upper limit of @xmath73mag of host - galaxy extinction .",
    "however , if the weak absorption feature is caused by noise instead of milky way gas , we can determine an upper limit on @xmath74 through comparison with our spectra of sn  2013dy ( zheng et al .",
    "2013 ) , where we clearly detect the  d absorption with the same instrument setting . for sn  2013dy , the equivalent width ( @xmath75 )",
    "is @xmath76from both the milky way and host galaxy , giving @xmath77mag .",
    "our similar - quality data on sn  2016coj should allow a detection of 1/3 ( or less ) of  d absorption if it exists , yielding an upper limit of @xmath78mag of host - galaxy extinction .",
    "lastly , we also estimate a @xmath79 upper limit on the @xmath75 of an undetected feature in a spectrum using the equation presented by leonard ( 2007 ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the spectral resolution element ( in  ) , @xmath82 is the 1@xmath83 root - mean - square fluctuation of the flux around a normalized continuum level , @xmath84 is the full - width at half - maximum intensity ( fwhm ) of the expected line feature , and @xmath1 is the number of bins per resolution element . for our high - s / n kast spectra , we measure @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 , which gives @xmath89 , and @xmath90mag of host - galaxy extinction .",
    "all of the above suggests that the host - galaxy extinction of sn  2016coj is likely to be very small , consistent with the nondetection of  d absorption in our high - resolution spectra ( see  [ ss : highresspectra ] ) .",
    "however , note that since the  d vs. extinction relation has large scatter , even a nondetection of  d does not fully exclude the possibility that there may be some dust along the sn line of sight .    the spectra show absorption features from ions typically seen in sne  ia including , , , , , and .",
    "we do not find a clear feature ( e.g. , zheng et al .",

    "the hvf feature of h&k stays for a long time , being distinct until roughly age + 11d ; thereafter , it is a high - velocity shoulder of the h&k absorption .",

    "the polarization feature appears to exhibit two peaks , perhaps associated with the high- and low - velocity components .",

    "the enhancement of the high - velocity component from day 6.9 has disappeared and the peak of the lower - velocity component has increased by @xmath140% .    by day 24.0 , the continuum and line polarization appears to have dropped substantially for wavelengths shortward of 7000 , with no significant change apparent at longer wavelengths ; polarization in the continuum region is undetected at this epoch .",
    "if real , such a continuum polarization drop roughly one week after peak would be reminiscent of the evolution of sn2001el ( wang et al .",
    "however , by day 44.0 the continuum polarization appears to have regained the strength exhibited on day 16.0 and earlier .",
    "has restrengthened as well , while declining in radial velocity along with the minimum of the weakening absorption profile .",
    "based on this unexpected restrengthening , we exercise caution regarding the temporarily weakened polarization on day 24.0 , as we are concerned that this could be the result of a systematic error .",
    "the drop in polarization appears to have only affected the stokes @xmath37 parameter ( derived from exposures with polarimeter waveplate angles at 0@xmath144 and 45@xmath144 ) .",
    "each of our three @xmath37 sequences of the sn are consistent , and we see no such change in the @xmath37 parameter of our standard - star observations from the same night . thus , if the change on day 24.0 is the result of systematic error ( e.g. , some unknown temporary source of instrumental polarization above our typical limit of @xmath145% ) , then it must have occurred over an hourly timescale . alternatively , a subsequent rise in continuum polarization on day 44.0 could result from the appearance of weak line features in the our chosen continuum region ( 67007150 ) , but in this case we would not expect the simultaneous rise in the feature . as a final possibility , the temporary influence of a separate light - echo component , possibly associated with dust in the host ism , could result in the observed fluctuation ; this possibility has the advantage of accounting for the brief change in the continuum and line polarization simultaneously , and it would also explain why the reddest wavelengths are not significantly affected .",

    ", the line polarization of @xmath143 combined with our measured value of @xmath146kms@xmath5day@xmath5 for the velocity evolution , shows that sn  2016coj falls where expected on the correlated distribution of sne  ia reported by maund et al .",
