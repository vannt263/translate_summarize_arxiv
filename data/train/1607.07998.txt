    "no technology is further from its thermodynamic limit than the switching that forms the basis of all information and communication technologies ( ict ) .",
    "a typical cmos logic operation dissipates about @xmath0 , which is 300,000 times the landauer minimum @xmath1 at room temperature . in a well designed device",
    "the dissipation of energy in a switching operation is dominated by a term associated with capacitive charging which scales as the voltage squared .",
    "the operating voltage is in turn constrained by the subthreshold swing , the change in gate voltage @xmath2 required to change the source - drain current by a factor of ten .",
    "this is limited by the exponential tail in the fermi - dirac distribution of the thermally excited electrons passing over the barrier created by the gate , which in the best case gives a current @xmath3  @xcite ,  i.e. a subthreshold swing of @xmath4 .",
    "this thermal limitation can be overcome by exploring quantum effects , as is done in tunnel - field effect transistors  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide a theoretical study , with a calculation for specific parameters , to show how quantum interference effects in single - molecule devices  @xcite could be used to give vast improvements in the subthreshold swing , and hence in the energy consumption of logic circuits .",
    "is limited by the electron temperature .",
    "the current is switched on when the transmission ( green curve ) and the distribution function has a significant overlap ; and the current is switched off when the transmission ( red curve ) is moved away from the distribution function . the gate voltage for switching the current",
    "is then limited by the temperature .",
    "( b ) the gate varies the form of the transmission function , and at a specific gate voltage @xmath5 ( or within a range of the gate voltage ) , the transmission function is greatly suppressed in ( rather than moved from ) the interval of the distribution function . ]    the current through a molecule can be expressed as @xmath6 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "this is the integration of the transmission @xmath7 and the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath8^{-1}$ ] , @xmath9 in the left and the right contact , where @xmath10 is the electrochemical potential of the contact-@xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the electron temperature . while the distribution function is only determined by source and drain voltages ( i.e.  @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the temperature @xmath12 , the transmission can be affected by many factors , e.g.   the internal dynamics of the molecule , the spectrum of contacts and the tunnel - coupling between the molecule and contacts .",
    "the current through the molecule can be controled by an electrostatic gate in two ways ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] ) : i ) the gate alters the energy of electrons in the molecule , i.e. shifting the transmission function along the energy axis , which changes the overlap between the transmission and the distribution function ; or ii ) the gate tunes the actual form of the transmission function , e.g.  the transmission peak is still in the distribution window but the height is suppressed .",
    "both mechanisms influence the current as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "if the first mechanism dominates , the gate voltage for switching on and off the current is limited by the electron temperature , i.e.  the change of the gate voltage ( @xmath15 ) must be larger than the width of the fermi - dirac distribution function of the leads . in order to seek a molecular transistor that is not limited by the fermi - dirac distribution of electrons in the contacts",
    ", we will therefore focus on the case in which the second mechanism plays a dominant role .",
    "to investigate the second mechanism , we first consider a molecule with two localised single - electron states l and r  @xcite , which are only coupled with the left and right contacts , respectively .",
    "the two localised states are coupled with each other via the tunnelling , hence , an electron can tunnel through the device from the left contact  state l  state r  right contact .",
    "the hamiltonian describing such a molecule is @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are respectively on - site energies and @xmath19 is the coupling strength . here , we focus on the case where electron - electron interactions are negligible . instead of varying the energy of all electrons in the molecule ( i.e. shifting the total transmission function ) , we assume the gate only changes the energy of electrons in the state r , i.e.  @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the amplitude of the transmission function will be tuned with the gate voltage .",
    "the transmission in this two - state model is @xmath20 ^ 2 + \\delta e^2\\gamma^2/4},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 are eigenenergies , @xmath22 is the difference between two eigenenergies , and @xmath23 is the tunnel - coupling strength between the molecule and contacts ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : twostate ] )  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we only discuss the case @xmath24 , however , the conclusion is similar for the case @xmath25 . if @xmath24 , the maximum value of the transmission is @xmath26 , which reaches @xmath27 when @xmath28 and decreases as @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "here we take the theoretical limit where @xmath31 and @xmath2 is the gate voltage . in this limit ,",
    "the gate voltage required for switching off the current is only determined by the coupling @xmath19 and independent with the electron temperature of two contacts . in a more realistic case",
    ", the detuning between the left and right localised state will only be a fraction of the applied gate voltage and a larger gate voltage will be required to switch the current .",
    "interference allows for more efficient switching of the current . if the transmission vanishes due to complete destructive interference at a gate voltage @xmath5 , any finite change of the gate voltage will result in the breaking of this interference condition and thus raise the current from zero to a finite intensity .",
    "although the destructive - interference current will never completely vanish as a result of imperfections in the practical situation , we still expect the current to be strongly suppressed when the interference condition is met . in the following",
    ", we will show that destructive interference can exist in molecules with four localised states , and that the current is switched more efficiently than in a two - state molecule .",
    "for interference to occur , there need to be at least two paths for electron transport . here",
    ", we consider molecules with two side groups and a central group as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](a ) .",
    "each side group is coupled with the corresponding contact , and there is no direct tunnelling between the central group and contacts .",
    "we assume only one single - electron state of each side group and the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) states of the central group are involved in the transport , while all other states are effectively irrelevant due to a large energy difference .",
    "homo and lumo states of the central group are tunnel - coupled with the side - group states .",
    "the transport in this kind of molecule can be described by a model of four localised states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) .",
    "there are two pathways for electrons to tunnel through the molecule : left  homo  right and left  lumo  right . when the energy of the homo ( lumo ) state is lower ( higher ) than side - group states , an electron going through the homo ( lumo ) path acquires a positive ( negative ) phase because the phase obtained in quantum evolution is @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the energy and @xmath34 is the evolution time .",
    "when the energy differences between side - group states and central - group states are much larger than the tunnel coupling , the phase difference between two paths is approximately @xmath35 , and the destructive interference occurs .",
    "the interference in the four - state model can also be understood using perturbation theory . when the energy differences @xmath36 and @xmath37 are much larger than the tunnel coupling matrix elements @xmath38 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) ] , states b and c can be adiabatically eliminated , and the two side - group states a and d are effectively directly coupled with an effective tunnel coupling matrix element @xmath39 . here , we have assumed that states a and d are nearly degenerate , i.e.  the energy difference between states a and d is much smaller than @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we also need to assume that coupling strengths between side groups and contacts are much smaller than @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that on - site energies of side - group states are well defined . when @xmath40 , the amplitudes of the two interference arms are identical , i.e.  the destructive interference is complete ; according to our discussions of the two - state model , the transmission ( @xmath41 ) is then zero , so the current is switched off .",
    "the perturbation theory is only an approximation method , i.e.  the transmission is not exactly zero even when the condition @xmath40 is satisfied . for simplicity , in the following we assume states a and d are degenerate and all four tunnel coupling matrix elements are identical , i.e.  @xmath42 . in this case",
    "the condition for complete destructive interference is @xmath43 . when this condition is satisfied , the transmission in the four - state model is @xmath44},\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath23 is the coupling strength for tunneling between the side groups and the contacts , @xmath46 , and without loss of generality we set the on - site energy of side - group states to zero ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : fourstate ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the case where the current results predominantly from transmission of electrons near to side - group energy levels ( @xmath47 ) , i.e.  the distribution function @xmath48 is centered around side - group levels and its width is smaller than the homo - lumo gap of the central group ( both the bias voltage and the temperature are low enough compared with the gap ) . in this case , we can rewrite the transmission as @xmath49 and the maximum of the transmission around @xmath50 is @xmath51 .    to switch the current , an electrostatic gate tunes the energy levels in the four - state molecule .",
    "similar to the two - state model , we assume the gate only changes the energy of electrons in the central group , i.e.  @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "moving the homo and lumo levels of the central group with the gate voltage will break the condition @xmath43 , resulting in an increase of the current .",
    "when the lumo ( homo ) level is aligned with side - group levels , the homo ( lumo ) state is effectively decoupled from other states due to the large energy difference , and the transmission is mainly due to the lumo ( homo ) state and two side - group states .",
    "then the transmission is increased to @xmath52},\\ ] ] which has the maximum value @xmath53 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : threestate ] ) . therefore , by varying the gate voltage for @xmath54 ( assuming that the shift of the energy levels is proportional to the gate voltage ) , the transmission can be switched for @xmath55 decades .",
    "compared with the two - state model , in which the off current decreases quadratically with the gate voltage , the current in the four - state model is more sensitive to the gate voltage , and the off current scales as @xmath56 .",
    "we would like to note that , unlike in the two - state model , here the off current is only given by the gate voltage around a specific value @xmath5 , and varying the voltage to either direction results in an increase of the current .",
    "the current for giving bias voltage and gate voltage in the four - state model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] . in our calculation",
    ", we have assumed that the homo - lumo gap of the central group @xmath57 is a constant , and that the gate voltage varies central - group levels in parallel with a lever arm @xmath27 , i.e.  @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and all other parameters , e.g.  @xmath23 and @xmath19 , are independent with the gate voltage .",
    "if the lever arm is not @xmath27 , the current is less sensitive to the gate voltage , but the quartic scaling still applies .",
    "side groups may be capacitively coupled to contacts , so two side - group states may only be degenerate if the basis voltage neutralizes the raw splitting between side - group states . including capacitive coupling to contacts ,",
    "the current shows a butterfly shape [ fig .",
    "[ fig : current](a ) ] as a function of gate and bias voltage , and the interference is maximised at the centre of the butterfly .",
    "because of interference , the current is not a monotonic function of the basis voltage , i.e.  the conductance can be negative upon reaching the interference condition .",
    "we find that the current [ black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](b ) ] can be much more sensitive to the gate voltage than in the case of a mosfet ; in fact , by changing the gate voltage by @xmath60 , the current is switched by two decades .",
    "in our previous discussion , we have neglected noise and interactions between electrons .",
    "the complete destructive interference is due to the exact cancellation of amplitudes of two arms , which relies on the appropriate energy difference between centre - group states and side - group states in the four - state model .",
    "electric - field noise and couplings to phonon modes may broadening the line widths of these localised states , so that energies of these states are not well defined . as a result",
    ", the minimum current will be larger than expected . at the point of maximum interference , a small variance of energy levels @xmath61 could cause the effective tunnelling between side - group states with the strength @xmath62 . according to our analysis of the two - state model ,",
    "the maximum transmission given by this effective tunnelling is @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , if the noise - induced broadening @xmath61 is much smaller than the broadening induced by the coupling to contacts @xmath23 , the performance of the switch will not be dramatically affected by noise . in fig .",
    "[ fig : current](b ) , we considered the effect of noise - induced broadening ( see dashed red and green curves ) using the master equation approach  @xcite .",
    "we find that , with the broadening @xmath64 , the current in the interference - based switch is still more sensitive to the gate voltage than in a mosfet .",
    "when interactions between electrons are weak , they will simply results in broadening of the line widths .",
    "when interactions are strong and the repulsion energy is larger than the tunnel coupling and the fermi - dirac distribution window , multi - electron transports is suppressed and electrons tunnel through the molecule one by one @xcite . in this case , the dynamic of the single electron is as the same as for interaction - free electrons , so that our analysis of the destructive interference is still valid .    up to this point",
    "we have assumed that the energy levels shift with a lever arm @xmath27 . while in reality",
    "this value is unachievable , values of 0.1 have been reported for single - molecule devices with a 3 nm thin gate oxide layer @xcite and as much as 0.3 for co - planar graphene gate electrodes @xcite , making our gating scheme feasible in a nanometre sized device geometry .",
    "moreover , different electrostatic gate coupling for different molecular orbitals has been theoretically predicted @xcite and demonstrated experimentally @xcite . in particular for a molecular design consisting of a central - group with weakly bound side - groups the electrostatic gate coupling to the central group",
    "is expected to be much larger than the electrostatic gate coupling to the side - groups .",
    "the parameters which we have used for the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] are illustrative .",
    "specific devices may perform worse or better .",
    "nevertheless the calculations show how molecular quantum interference can yield a subthreshold slope that is not thermally limited and is almost independent of temperature .",
    "huge advances are being made in the stability and reproducibility of single - molecule devices , enabled by the use of nanogaps in graphene ribbons for electrodes  @xcite .",
    "conditions are therefore excellent to develop molecular electronics with the potential to reduce the energy consumption of switching for ict .",
    "there is plenty of thermodynamic room for improvement , and quantum interference may enable some of this potential to be realised .",
    "the transmission is given by  @xcite @xmath65 , \\label{eq : transmission}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the retarded green s function , @xmath67 is the advanced green s function , and @xmath68 $ ] are matrices describing couplings to contacts . here",
