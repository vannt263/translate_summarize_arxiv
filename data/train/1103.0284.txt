    "planets are made from gas and dust in disks that orbit young stars .",
    "the physical characteristics and evolution of that disk material have a profound impact on the outcome and efficiency of the planet formation process .",
    "while a massive theoretical effort has been made to elucidate the physical mechanisms that contribute to the assembly of a planetary system , any successful planet formation model needs to be informed by observations .",
    "an important goal is to generate models that incorporate empirical insights on the properties of circumstellar disks and are able to reproduce key demographic features of the exoplanet population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . one essential aspect of meeting that goal is the ability to make measurements related to the initial conditions imposed by the disk material .",
    "however , those constraints on initial conditions must be coupled with a characterization of disk evolution , which is ultimately responsible for the dynamical and physical properties of any resulting planetary system .    for most of its lifetime ,",
    "the evolution of a protoplanetary disk is regulated by the interaction of gravitational and viscous stresses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . thought to be produced by magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , the viscosity of the disk material acts to channel mass toward the star by transporting angular momentum out to larger disk radii @xcite .",
    "this viscous evolution process decreases the densities and mass flow rates in the region of the disk where planets are made , and therefore sets a bound on the period where formation conditions are most favorable .",
    "moreover , the viscous properties of the disk control the dynamics of solid bodies , from the radial drift of dust particles @xcite to the orbital migration of protoplanets @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced some indirect methods for placing observational constraints on viscous evolution , based on tracking the decline of accretion rates with age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and characterizing disk sizes and surface density profiles with resolved millimeter observations @xcite .",
    "more direct approaches have focused on characterizing the anomalous viscosities , including attempts to measure the disk magnetic field structure @xcite and turbulent velocities @xcite .    although viscous evolution controls the long - term behavior of disk material , there is strong observational evidence that some ( if not all ) disks undergo a faster evolutionary phase that should have important consequences for the assembly and development of planetary systems .",
    "a small subsample of young disks exhibits a distinctive dip in their infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , suggesting that warm dust near the central star is substantially depleted compared to larger radii in the disk @xcite . since these so - called  transition \" disks represent only a few percent of the total population in nearby star - forming regions with ages up to a few myr @xcite , the inside - out dispersal of disk material they appear to trace must occur quite rapidly ( a few @xmath5 0.1myr , assuming all disks go through this phase at some point ) . a variety of dissipation mechanisms have been proposed to explain observations of transition disks , including extensive particle growth @xcite , photoevaporative mass - loss in winds @xcite , and tidal interactions with companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a tantalizing example of the latter possibility , the transition disk structures might have been modified by dynamical interactions with very young giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if that is the case , the size and material content of the dust - depleted region can in principle be used to constrain the orbit and mass of the unseen planetary companion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "regardless of which physical mechanism is responsible , this rapid evolutionary phase is potentially extraordinarily important in the context of planet formation . since the short timescale for",
    "the dispersal or transformation of disk material can be quite influential on the accretion and migration history of young planets , this transitional period may play a dominant role in setting the final masses and orbital configurations of planetary systems . in that sense ,",
    "the transition disks are crucial benchmarks for planet formation models that rely on observational comparisons of disk properties with the demographic characteristics of the much older population of exoplanets .",
    "there is an extensive literature on transition disk observations , ranging from their identification and initial probes of empirical trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to detailed analyses of their broadband seds and infrared spectra @xcite . to facilitate the inclusion of this phase of disk evolution into the next generation of planet formation models ,",
    "such studies must be coupled with firm observational constraints on the sizes and material contents of the dust - depleted zones in transition disks , as well as improved characterizations of their remnant mass reservoirs at larger radii .",
    "those goals are best achieved by resolving their optically thin dust emission at millimeter wavelengths @xcite .    in this paper , we present the first large sample of high angular resolution millimeter continuum observations of protoplanetary transition disks and analyze them in a homogeneous framework by constructing parametric models of their dust structures . these interferometric data and their calibration are described in  2 .",
    "detailed explanations of the adopted modeling formalism , radiative transfer calculations , and uncertainties in the modeling process are provided in  3 . a preliminary characterization of the transition disk structures",
    "is included in  4 .",
    "the data and models are synthesized and discussed in the context of disk evolution mechanisms in  5 , with the key results summarized in  6 . a brief commentary on each individual disk is included in the appendix .",

    "the infrared luminosity still partly scales with density : for a given @xmath53 , a denser disk has more dust at larger heights above the midplane , increasing the height and temperature of the infrared photosphere .",
    "the result is a brighter ( and hotter ) excess spectrum .",
    "the same is true for the inner rim , and therefore @xmath33 can also have an impact on shadowing .",
    "provided a sufficiently high rim height , @xmath56 and @xmath33 are degenerate ( see figure [ pareffects]a , b ) : higher rims can compensate for lower densities ( at least partially ) .",
    "moreover , the inner disk size ( fixed here to 10au ) is also degenerate with @xmath33 : a more extended inner disk ( a smaller gap , or even no gap ) can usually be accomodated by decreasing @xmath33 .",

    "therefore , without spatially resolved observations , the detailed characteristics of the material inside transition disk cavities are strongly model - dependent and highly uncertain .    despite our ignorance of the detailed structures of the inner disk and rim",

    "figure [ pareffects]c demonstrates the sensitivity of this null position to @xmath93 ; modifications on the order of 10%  are readily detectable for typical noise levels .",
    "however , we should note that these null positions also have a roughly linear dependance on the radial gradient of the surface brightness profile , which is set by the product of @xmath52 and the midplane temperature profile . since the latter is approximately a power - law in these models ( @xmath94 ;",

    "the standard mass - opacity degeneracy for optically thin emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and the intricate relationship between irradiation , heating , and grain properties in the disk atmosphere @xcite are important , but will not be reviewed again here .",
    "the degeneracy of interest is related to how our method of inferring densities in the inner disk ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) depends on the dust opacities inside the cavity .",
    "since we lack any resolved millimeter signal inside @xmath35 ( although see  4 regarding lkca 15 ) , the inner disk densities are determined solely from the infrared spectrum . in most cases ,",
    "the relatively strong silicate emission features we observe suggest that the cavity is populated by  small \" grains ( i.e. , @xmath98 - 10@xmath1 m or less ) . to be conservative , we do not assume that any additional material is present .",
    "this small dust becomes optically thick even at the relatively low column densities ( @xmath310@xmath99 g @xmath100 , give or take an order of magnitude ; see figure [ opacities ] ) that are present in some non - negligible part of the inner disk .",
    "the sizes of these high optical depth regions are effectively responsible for setting @xmath33 : for a given structure , more mass would over - produce the infrared luminosities . in some sense , this aspect of the modeling tends to minimize @xmath33 ( or maximize the depletion of dust densities inside @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , more material could easily be accomodated in the inner disk if it has lower infrared opacities ( e.g. , @xmath70 larger than a few @xmath1 m ; see  4 ) .",
    "finally , a few notes about the outer disk parameters are in order ( for a more complete discussion , see * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to emphasize that the nature of transition disk structures makes it difficult to constrain radial gradient parameters ( @xmath60 or @xmath62 ) . for smaller disks ,",
    "the same is true for the characteristic radius , @xmath31 .",
    "the issue is limited dynamic range ; only a few radial resolution elements can probe the millimeter emission in a ring ( which is why we chose to fix @xmath60 ) , and the far - infrared sed that is less affected by the cavity is only sparsely sampled . while we have a reasonable constraint on the vertical distribution of dust ( @xmath61 ) from the infrared luminosities ,",
    "the current lack of far - infrared data means that we do not have a good handle on the scale height gradient , @xmath62 , for these transition disks with large cavities . linking these models with scattered light observations that specialize in constraining the flaring angle",
    "( i.e. , @xmath62 ) will be beneficial in the future .    although they were fixed , the settling parameters \\{@xmath63 , @xmath64 } merit a brief discussion .",
    "the fraction of large dust grains , @xmath64 , helps set the height where stellar photons are absorbed : smaller @xmath64 means an increased optical depth ( more abundant small grains ) at a fixed height , and therefore a slightly warmer atmosphere that emits more infrared radiation .",
    "the effects of @xmath63 , the fractional scale height of the large grain population , are subtle . in practice",
    ", @xmath63 modifies the vertical temperature gradient at intermediate heights in the disk atmosphere : a larger @xmath63 leads to a cooler temperature in a fixed vertical layer .",
    "although potentially important for more direct tracers of the disk atmosphere ( e.g. , scattered light or molecular line emission ) , these effects are indistinguishable from adjustments to the scale height parameters , \\{@xmath61 , @xmath62 } , with the data used here .",

    "out of that sample , large cavities ( @xmath137au ) have been directly resolved for 9 disks ( 10% , including ry tau ; see * ? ? ?",

    "these transition disk fractions are lower bounds ; there could very well be more disks with large cavities that have yet to be imaged at sufficient resolution .",
    "the maximum fraction of this type of transition disk in the upper half ( or quartile ) of the @xmath136 distribution is @xmath370% , based on the known absence of large cavities in some of the remaining disks @xcite .    to reiterate those remarkable statistics : at least 1 in 5 , and possibly up to @xmath3two - thirds of the known millimeter - bright disks have _ large _ dust - depleted cavities ( with @xmath140au ) .",

    "regardless , the implication is that a large fraction of the most millimeter - bright  and therefore most massive  disks show unequivocal evidence for substantial dust evolution in the regions most relevant for planet formation on timescales of less than @xmath31 - 2myr ( for reference , the median and quartile @xmath136 values correspond to disk masses of 0.005m@xmath122 and 0.011m@xmath122 , respectively , using the standard andrews & williams assumptions ) .",
    "this reinforces a similar conjecture made by @xcite based on a group of unresolved taurus disks , although see  5.3.3 regarding their corollary claim of low accretion rates .",

    "the cavity sizes and millimeter luminosities are not the only clues available to help characterize transition disk evolution , and we would be remiss not to address potential hints from the cavity contents . in terms of their near - infrared excess luminosities , it is clear that not all transition disks are alike : some are faint ( in this sample , dm tau , gm aur , rx j1615 - 3255 , and perhaps sr 21 ) and others are quite bright ( e.g. , doar 44 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the latter cases , dubbed ",
    "pre - transition \" disks , may be more representative of gaps than cavities .",
    "that hypothesis ( and accompanying nomenclature ) supposes that the transition disks with brighter infrared excesses trace an earlier stage of the inner disk depletion process . that may very well be the case , but the properties of the inner disk are so poorly constrained that it is not the only possibility . while there is no clear association of infrared excess luminosity with the depletion factor , @xmath33 , we were forced to remove dust inside @xmath31au to avoid over - producing the observed emission for our dm tau and rx j1615 - 3255 models ( see the appendix )",
    "that is in good agreement with the original @xcite conjecture , where the inner disk densities ( or optical depths ) and excess levels are related .",
    "however , the strength of the infrared excess is also tied to the vertical distribution of dust near the star : larger heights generate more emission ( see  3 , or * ? ? ?",

    "the initially small cavity made in this way exposes the disk edge near the wind launch radius to unattenuated high - energy irradiation , accelerating the dispersal of material and growth of the cavity .",
    "although this photoevaporation process only directly affects the gas phase of the disk ( only the very smallest dust grains , @xmath144@xmath1 m , are directly swept away in the wind ) , @xcite demonstrated that a simple prescription for the radial drift of solids promotes the simultaneous depletion of dust inside the wind - blown cavity .    in models that consider only uv irradiation",

    "while the present study is just one of the first steps , ultimately high angular resolution radio mapping of disk structures can serve as a new tool to guide searches for young exoplanets , as well as to characterize some of their fundamental properties .",

    "@xcite also modeled the mwc 758 disk structure with some of these sma data ( and supplementary 3 mm observations ) , choosing not to modify the accretion disk model to include a cavity ( i.e. , @xmath134 at all radii in their work ) but to allow the gradient of the viscosity profile ( @xmath60 ) to vary freely .",

    "<S> circumstellar disks are thought to experience a rapid  transition \" phase in their evolution that can have a considerable impact on the formation and early development of planetary systems . </S>",
    "<S> we present new and archival high angular resolution ( @xmath0 - 75au ) submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of the 880@xmath1 m ( 340ghz ) dust continuum emission from 12 such transition disks in nearby star - forming regions . in each case , we directly resolve a dust - depleted disk cavity around the central star . using two - dimensional monte carlo radiative transfer calculations , </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these dust disk structures in a homogeneous , parametric model framework by reproducing their sma continuum visibilities and spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the cavities in these disks are large ( @xmath2 - 73au ) and substantially depleted of small ( @xmath3@xmath1m - sized ) dust grains , although their mass contents are still uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the structures of the remnant material at larger radii are comparable to normal disks . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these large cavities are relatively common among the millimeter - bright disk population , comprising at least 1 in 5 ( 20% ) of the disks in the bright half ( and @xmath426%  of the upper quartile ) of the millimeter luminosity ( disk mass ) distribution . utilizing these results , </S>",
    "<S> we assess some of the physical mechanisms proposed to account for transition disk structures . as has been shown before </S>",
    "<S> , photoevaporation models do not produce the large cavity sizes , accretion rates , and disk masses representative of this sample </S>",
    "<S> . it would be difficult to achieve a sufficient decrease of the dust optical depths in these cavities by particle growth alone : substantial growth ( to meter sizes or beyond ) must occur in large ( tens of au ) regions of low turbulence without also producing an abundance of small particles . given those challenges , we suggest instead that the observations are most commensurate with dynamical clearing due to tidal interactions with low - mass companions  young brown dwarfs or giant planets on long - period orbits . </S>"
