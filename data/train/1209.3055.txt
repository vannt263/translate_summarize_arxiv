    "topological solitons are smooth , stable , particle - like solutions to non - linear wave equations that occur in field theories @xcite .",
    "these include solitons such as monopoles in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions and vortices and lumps in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions",
    ". however , although some of the physically interesting theories with solitons may be exactly solvable in the static case ( through the reduction of second order to first order differential equations via a bogomolny argument @xcite ) , they are usually not integrable upon the introduction of time dependence .",
    "this makes it difficult to study soliton dynamics and usually one must make use of approximations or numerical simulations .",
    "here , we present both of these approaches , this time in the context of @xmath0 kinks .",
    "our aim is to use one method to test the other .",
    "model has also been investigated recently , see @xcite ] section 2 presents a discussion of @xmath0 kinks . then section 3 introduces our collective coordinate approximation , with section 3.1 discussing one @xmath0 kink and section 3.2 focusing on two kinks .",
    "section 4 presents dynamics for two kinks .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "the @xmath0 model is a field theory in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions involving a real field @xmath1 the lagrangian density is given by    @xmath2    where    @xmath3    varying ( [ phi6 ] ) leads to the equation of motion    @xmath4    the bogomolny equations are [ boggeneral ] @xmath5 for the @xmath0 model they become    @xmath6    this ode can be solved exactly for both signs . taking the negative sign , we find a kink ( with @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and an antikink ( with @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "the kink solution is    @xmath11    where @xmath12 has been introduced as a constant of integration .",
    "note that the factor @xmath13 has been included to position the kink at the origin when @xmath14    now taking the positive sign in ( [ phi6bog ] ) , we again find a kink ( this time with @xmath9 and @xmath15 ) and an antikink ( with @xmath16 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "the kink solution is    @xmath17    where @xmath12 is again an arbitrary constant and @xmath13 is included .    in both ( [ phi6kink1 ] ) and ( [ phi6kink2 ] ) , the constant @xmath12 represents the position or modulus of the soliton . @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent kinks positioned at @xmath20 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "note we have the symmetry    @xmath21    we can demonstrate that @xmath20 and @xmath12 are the moduli of the kinks by considering the energy density    @xmath22    here @xmath23 is a static kink field .",
    "( [ energydensity ] ) implies    @xmath24    consider ( [ phi6kink1 ] ) . when @xmath25 @xmath26 hence , for this point to represent the maximum of the energy density and therefore the kink position we need @xmath27 differentiating ( [ phi6kink1 ] ) we see that this is indeed the case .",
    "similarly we find @xmath28    the dynamics of a kink given by ( [ phi6kink1 ] ) or ( [ phi6kink2 ] ) can be found by a simple lorentz boost , e.g.    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is , as usual , the kink speed ( with @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 is the lorentz factor .",
    "note that while the dynamics of one kink , in this model , can be found by direct integration , those of multi - kinks can not . this is a result of the fact that the @xmath0 model is not an example of an integrable system and therefore , unlike for the well - studied sine - gordon model , solution generating techniques such as the bcklund transformation are not applicable .",
    "in @xcite , a moduli space approximation was introduced .",
    "this kind of approximation was originally implemented for a system of solitons for which there are no static forces . in the case of monopoles",
    "it is possible to have multi - soliton configurations that are static with no forces between solitons ( critical coupling ) because of a precise balancing between a magnetic force and a scalar interaction ( due to a higgs field ) .",
    "this leads to geodesic trajectories of multi - solitons on the space of static configurations ( the moduli space ) . for kinks , of course",
    ", only a single kink can be static and the calculation is simple . we demonstrate this for a @xmath0 kink .",
    "a static kink is given by ( [ phi6kink2 ] ) . here",
    "the parameter or modulus is a real number @xmath12 and hence the moduli space is simply @xmath33 the moduli space approximation is to consider a flow on this manifold , i.e. to make @xmath12 time - dependent , and to then substitute this dynamical field into ( [ phi6 ] ) .",
    "integrating over all space gives the dynamics    @xmath34    hence motion at a constant speed .",
    "generally , when there are no static forces , there is geodesic motion on the moduli space .      when there are static forces , the moduli space approximation becomes harder to implement .",
    "we consider multi - solitons that experience static forces . here",
    ", it is possible to make progress by taking 1-soliton configurations that are static and patching these into one field then performing a flow .",
    "when the solitons are far apart the field will be accurate .",
    "it is then hoped that when the solitons approach and interact , the approximation will still be good .",
    "this approach has been applied for solitonic structures such as lumps , vortices and monopoles , as well as kinks .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a study of classical and quantum monopole scattering , @xcite for vortex scattering , and @xcite for classical lump scattering .",
    "there is confidence in the validity of such a method . to provide further confidence",
    "we can perform `` tests '' on one - dimensional models .",
    "such a test was performed on the scattering of two sine - gordon kinks by sutcliffe @xcite . here",
    "we show how to perform such a test on the @xmath0 model .",
    "we choose to obtain a 2-kink field by patching together two 1-kink solutions in the following way    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the collective coordinate , so that @xmath37 is one dimensional .",
    "to perform the truncation to a one dimensional system we substitute the ansatz ( [ kinkansatz ] ) into the lagrangian density ( [ phi6 ] ) , and integrate over all @xmath38 this leads to the lagrangian    @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the metric on @xmath37    @xmath41    and @xmath42 is the potential    @xmath43    where    @xmath44    and    @xmath45    in figures [ metric ] and [ potential ] , we plot the metric and potential .",
    "we see that as @xmath46 , the metric and potential both tend to @xmath47 we expect this since in this limit there is negligible interaction between the kinks and there will therefore be geodesic motion on @xmath37 with the mass of the system being double the mass of a @xmath0 kink .",
    "indeed the asymptotic interaction energy of two @xmath0 kinks is    metric.eps    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the kink separation .",
    "potential.eps    in the next section we consider the dynamical system that is given by the lagrangian ( [ langragianphi6 ] ) in order to study kink scattering .",
    "on varying the lagrangian ( [ langragianphi6 ] ) we obtain the field equation    @xmath50    which we can interpret as a particle with position @xmath51 moving in a potential @xmath42 , with variable mass @xmath40 .",
    "the initial conditions for kink scattering with a velocity @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the total energy of the system is    @xmath55    so that the turning point of the motion , @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 .",
    "we can simply solve the equation of motion ( [ eq of motion ] ) by quadrature to obtain @xmath51 implicitly as    @xmath58    which is valid for @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the turning time @xmath61 .",
    "the position for @xmath62 is determined by the fact that the motion is symmetric about @xmath60 , i.e. @xmath63 .",
    "realdynamics.eps    in order to derive the approximate dynamics , the task is therefore to compute the numerical integrals in ( [ num in ] ) . in figure [ realdyn ]",
    "we plot such approximate dynamics for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we also include the dynamics according to a standard runga - kutta code .",
    "we see that the approximate dynamics are qualitatively correct and are accurate before the `` apparent '' point of least approach .",
    "the motion according to ( [ kinkansatz ] ) is seen to take place in a stronger potential than the actual potential .",
    "this can be compared to sutcliffe s analysis @xcite for the sine - gordon model where rather than using a patching of two kinks like we have done in this chapter , that is    @xmath66    the following patching is used    @xmath67    in figure [ sut ] , we plot @xmath68 and @xmath69 with the kinks close together ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "we see that the kinks , according to ( [ sut2 ] ) , start to deform slightly compared to ( [ sut1 ] ) .",
    "this has the effect of `` softening '' the `` apparent potential '' and is what gives the results presented in @xcite where both dynamics remain more or less the same for all time .",
    "the patching for @xmath0 kinks presented in this chapter does not , in the same way , take account of solitons deforming when they are close to each other .",
    "however , the early time dynamics according to our approximation show that in this regime it works well numerically .",
    "such dynamics have also been calculated for a smaller initial speed ( @xmath71 ) and results obtained are qualitatively the same .    sutcliffe.eps",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the collective coordinate approximation in the context of @xmath0 kinks with the aim of showing how to test the validity of the method , which is much used in the study of solitons .",
    "we have found that the bogomolny equations can be solved exactly for this model leading to 1-soliton solutions that can then be `` patched '' together .",
    "this field led to a dynamical system for which the approximate motion was found via a series of numerical integrals .",
    "the `` real dynamics '' were calculated through a numerical code and presented .",
    "as expected , two kinks moving towards each other at non - relativistic speeds , slow down , because of their mutual repulsion , and eventually momentarily stop , then move apart .    with our initial conditions , the approximation we have made leads to dynamics which , for time before @xmath72 are of a good level of accuracy . due to the way we patch the kinks together , the solitons observe a potential that is stronger than the actual potential .",
    "we conclude that the collective coordinate approximation presented in this paper leads to dynamics that are qualitatively the same as the actual dynamics and works well numerically in the early time regime , and that the approximation could be improved if the deformation of solitons as they begin to coalesce could be taken into account .",
