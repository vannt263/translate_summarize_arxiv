    "vortex matter offers the advantage that the periodicity @xmath12 of the hexagonal lattice can be tuned by changing the magnetic induction @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the effect of various types of pinning potentials can be studied .",
    "this pinning potential , arising from inhomogeneities in the host material , can be completely random , as in most natural materials , or can be arranged in periodic arrays using nano - fabrication techniques @xcite . in a variety of cases",
    "correlated inhomogeneities occur naturally in a material , such as twin boundaries and the layered structure of the high @xmath14 superconductors @xcite .",
    "depinning of the vl in a _ random potential",
    "_ generally involves regions of plastic deformations @xcite , i.e. coexistence of ( temporarily ) pinned domains with moving domains .",
    "for very weak pinning the typical domain size can exceed the correlation length @xmath15 of the vl ( see @xcite ) and the weak collective pinning theory @xcite can be successfully used to estimate the critical current density @xmath16 @xcite . however , as either the ratio of the vl shear modulus @xmath17 and the elementary pinning strength or the number of pins per correlated volume decreases , plastically deformed regions start to have a noticeable effect on @xmath16 .",
    "recent imaging experiments @xcite have shown directly that the rise in @xmath16 in weak pinning materials near the upper critical field @xmath18 , known as the peak effect @xcite , originates from such , rather sudden , enhancement of the defect density .",
    "this strong reduction of the vl correlation length is also accompanied by a qualitative change in the nature of depinning : for strong pinning , depinning proceeds through a dense network of quasi - static flow channels ( filaments ) such that the typical width of both static and moving domains has approached the lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "depinning transitions via a sequence of static , channel like structures have also been observed experimentally via transport experiments @xcite .    in superconductors with _",
    "periodic _ pinning arrays ( ppa s ) , matching effects between the lattice and the ppa become important .",
    "as shown first by daldini and martinoli @xcite , when the vortex spacing coincides with the periodicity of the potential , pronounced maxima can occur in @xmath16 , while at mismatch defects ( discommensurations ) appear which gives rise to a reduced @xmath16 .",
    "the last decade , many more studies of vl s in ppa s have appeared , both experimentally and numerically .",
    "pronounced commensurability effects were found in films with 2-d periodic pinning @xcite for flux densities equal to ( integers of ) the density of dots . in these systems , vortex chains at interstitial positions of the periodic arrays ( e.g. at the second matching field of a square pinning array ) can exhibit quasi one - dimensional motion under the influence of the interaction with neighboring , pinned vortices @xcite , as has also been observed in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition these simulations have revealed that , depending on the vortex interactions and the symmetry or strength of the ppa , a rich variety of other states and dynamic transitions can occur , often leading to peculiar transport characteristics .    besides the above examples , the phenomenon of vortex channelling can also arise from the presence of grain boundaries in the sample .",
    "historically , the shear depinning of vortices in grain boundaries in low @xmath14 materials received considerable attention @xcite because it could explain the quadratic decrease of @xmath16 near @xmath18 in practically relevant poly - crystalline superconductors .",
    "more recently , the interesting issue of channelling of mixed abrikosov - josephson vortices in grain boundaries in high @xmath14 materials was addressed in detail by gurevich @xcite .    a system in which channel motion and its dependence on the structural properties of vortex matter",

    "the samples are fabricated by etching straight channels of width @xmath19 nm through the top layer of an a - nbge / nbn double layer . with a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the film ,",
    "vortices penetrate both the strong pinning nbn in the channel edges ( ce s ) and the remaining nbge weak pinning channels .",
    "the strongly pinned ce vortices provide confinement to the vortices inside the channel as well as the pinning ( shear ) potential which opposes the lorentz force from a transport current @xmath20 applied perpendicular to the channel . by changing the applied field",
    "@xmath21 one can tune the commensurability between the vortex lattice constants and the channel width , allowing a detailed study of the shear response and threshold for plastic flow as a function of the mismatch and the actual microstructure in the channel .",
    "phenomenologically , plastic flow in the channel occurs when the force density @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 the vortex density ) exceeds @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the flow stress at the edge ( the factor 2 is due to both ce s ) and @xmath1 is the effective width between the first pinned vortex rows , defined in fig .",
    "[ plot_sketch ] .",
    "thus , the critical force density is given by : @xmath26 the parameter @xmath27 describes microscopic details of the system : it depends on lattice orientation , ( an)harmonicity of the shear potential , details of the vortex structure in the ce s and the microstructure of the array inside the channel .",
    "critical current measurements as function of applied field reflected this change in microstructure through oscillations of @xmath28 , shown in fig .",
    "[ plot_introfs ] for a channel with @xmath29 nm .",
    "note that in such a narrow channel , the pinning strength due to intrinsic disorder in the a - nbge is at most @xmath30 of @xmath28 ( except for @xmath31 mt ) and does not affect the oscillations .",
    "since the natural row spacing of the vl is @xmath32 , with @xmath33 , and in our geometry @xmath34 one can check that the periodicity of the oscillations corresponds to transitions from @xmath3 to @xmath35 with @xmath4 integer , i.e. the principal lattice vector @xmath36 is oriented along the channel ( fig .",
    "[ plot_sketch ] ) .",
    "the envelope curve represents eq.([phenomenological ] ) with brandt s expression for the vl shear modulus @xcite : @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the reduced field and @xmath39 is the penetration depth ) and a value @xmath40 .",
    "this value for @xmath27 is close to the value @xmath41 for the relative displacements at the crossover from elastic to plastic deformations as obtained from measurements on the peak effect @xcite .",
    "this led to a qualitative interpretation of the reduction of @xmath28 at minima as being due to defects in the channel , which develop at incommensurability .",
    "however , recent developments @xcite have shown that ( strong ) structural disorder may be present in the ce arrays , in which case the interpretation can drastically differ .",
    "in this article we present numerical and analytical studies of the threshold force and dynamics of vortices in the channel system for various degrees of edge disorder . in an early paper @xcite we studied the commensurability effects in the idealized case with periodic arrays in the ce s .",
    "in this situation @xmath28 at matching ( @xmath3 ) is equal to the ideal lattice strength @xmath42 ( the value @xmath43 follows from frenkels considerations @xcite ) , while at mismatch dislocations develop , leading to @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting series of delta - like peaks in @xmath28 versus matching parameter differed considerably from the experimental results , which could not be explained by thermal fluctuations or intrinsic disorder inside the channel .",
    "therefore we investigated the effect of positional disorder in the ce arrays on @xmath28 near commensurability ( @xmath45 ) @xcite . in this regime",
    "the behavior is dominated by the longitudinal displacements of vortices in the chains , i.e. quasi one - dimensional ( @xmath46d ) , and @xmath28 is controlled by defects with burgers vector along the channel . at weak disorder , we found a clear reduction of @xmath28 at commensurability caused by nucleation of defects at threshold , while the existing defects at incommensurability become pinned by disorder , leading to an increase of @xmath28 in the mismatching case .",
    "the present paper first describes in detail these quasi 1d phenomena near commensurability and/or for weak disorder . using a generalized sine - gordon model ,",
    "we quantitatively describe how the structure and transport properties depend on the vortex interaction range and on weak disorder in the ce s .",
    "besides the connection to our system , these results also provide a background for understanding quasi-@xmath46d vortex states and matching effects in artificial ppa s , including the effects of disorder which these ppa s may contain due to fabrication uncertainties .",
    "the 1d model shows that , above a certain disorder strength , spontaneously ( disorder ) induced defects along the ce s dominate over incommensurability induced defects .",
    "the commensurability peak in @xmath28 is then completely smeared out with a value of @xmath28 at matching ( @xmath3 ) saturating at @xmath7 of the ideal lattice strength . in the more general case of wider channels ,",
    "the _ transverse _ degrees of freedom , especially away from matching ( @xmath47 ) , lead to new phenomena : under the influence of disorder , the channel array may split up in regions with @xmath4 and @xmath48 rows , involving dislocations with burgers vector strongly _ misaligned _ with the ce s . at sufficient disorder strength ,",
    "such dislocations lead to a more effective pinning of the array then the aligned dislocations around matching .",
    "@xmath28 then exhibits a smooth oscillation as function of @xmath11 , similar to fig .",
    "[ plot_introfs ] , with yield strength maxima occurring _ around mismatch_.",
    "this behavior resembles the classical peak effect , i.e. at mismatch the enhanced ability of the arrays to sample configuration space allows better adjustment to the random ce s . in the last part of the paper",
    "we show detailed simulations of both static and dynamical aspects of this behavior , including a study of reordering phenomena at large drive .",
    "we find an ordering velocity of the arrays with a channel width dependence similar to that of the threshold force .",
    "using a modified version of the dynamic ordering theory in @xcite it is shown that such behavior can be explained by a reduction of the energy for formation of misaligned defect pairs away from matching .",
    "the numerical results at strong disorder are also in good qualitative agreement with recent mode - locking experiments on the channel system @xcite .",

    "we have presented a detailed study of the properties of vortices confined to narrow flow channels with pinned vortices in the channel edges . in the experimental system which motivated this work @xcite ,",
    "the threshold force ( yield strength ) shows pronounced commensurability oscillations when the natural vortex row spacing is varied through integer fractions of the channel width . the analysis and simulations presented in this paper show that in a mesoscopic channel system the dependence of threshold on commensurability as well as the dynamics of vortices in the channels drastically vary with the amount of disorder in the confining arrays . at zero or weak disorder",
    "the system behaves similar to 1d ljj - systems and defects at the ce s reduce the yield strength . at large disorder",
    "the behavior involves transitions from quasi-1d to 2d structures , where an increase in the amount of plastic deformations enhances the yield strength similar to the situation in the classical peak effect in superconductors .",
    "we first presented a generalized sine - gordon description for a 1d vortex chain in an ideally ordered channel . in this case ( or for channels with multiple chains near commensurability ) the threshold force has sharp peaks at commensurate widths , whereas it is essentially vanishing at incommensurability due to easy glide of aligned defects , i.e. defects with burgers vector along the ce .",
    "the model was then extended to study the effects of weak disorder in the confining arrays .",
    "simulations and analytical results showed that this disorder causes the sharp maxima in the threshold force at matching to be lowered and broadened due to nucleation ( at matching ) and pinning(at mismatch ) of edge defects .",
    "apart from these defects , the arrays respond elastically in this regime , both near threshold and at large drive .",
    "we studied numerically the relevant edge defect dynamics and , using the sine - gordon model , we analyzed the crossover to strong defect pinning on increasing the disorder strength .    for large disorder in the ce s , matching between the longitudinal vortex spacings in and outside the channel becomes irrelevant and the peaks in threshold force around matching completely vanish with a saturated value for @xmath287 of about @xmath586 of the ideal lattice strength . around mismatch however , the arrays become susceptible to formation of defects with burgers vector misoriented with the channel direction .",
    "such defects either locally break up the integer chain structure or exist at the boundaries of @xmath4 and @xmath10-row regions coexisting in the channel . at large disorder , they are strongly pinned and cause the threshold force to exceed that around matching . approaching a matching condition , the density of misaligned defects is reduced and a smooth modulation of @xmath287 results , with minima near matching .",
    "the depinning transition always involves plastic deformations _ inside _ the channel , but the amount of plasticity drastically increases away from matching . using the density of transverse switching points ( obtained from the transverse diffusion in the moving structures ) as dynamic order parameter , we study the evolution of the moving structures on changing the channel width and the drive .",
    "the arrays reorder ( partially ) into transversely frozen @xmath4-row regions at a velocity @xmath533 which shows a similar modulation with commensurability as the threshold force . finally , we compared the modulations of @xmath287 and @xmath533 at strong disorder with the available experimental results and with the dynamic ordering theory in @xcite and find good qualitative agreement .",
