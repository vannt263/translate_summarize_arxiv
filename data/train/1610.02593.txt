    "first , our proof works on lattices where near - critical percolation estimates hold , and this includes most regular planar lattices , including edge or site fpp on the hexagonal lattice , square lattice , triangular lattice , etc .",
    "the main difference is that one must assume that @xmath45 , where @xmath6 is the critical threshold for percolation on that lattice .",
    "next , it is important to point out that using the work of aizenman - burchard , we can give a simple proof for question  [ q : kz ] ( see section  [ sec : sketch ] ) , but this argument only gives a small polynomial decay of the probability in .",
    "our main inequality is sufficient ( but polynomial decay is not ) to , for example , bound the length of all geodesics simultaneously between points sufficiently far apart in a box .",
    "last we briefly remark on the proof ; a full outline of it appears in section  [ sec : sketch ] .",
    "the strategy is to combine a block argument from pisztora @xcite with the aizenman - burchard technique .",
    "the block argument is quite similar to @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is in the aizenman - burchard technique : the hypothesis of @xcite does not hold for our model .",
    "their method relies on a strong independence assumption : to apply their theorem one would need to know that there is @xmath46 such that for any number of thin cylinders @xmath47 which are sufficiently separated , the probability that a geodesic crosses all of these cylinders in the long direction ( has a `` straight run '' in each cylinder ) is at most @xmath48 . under this assumption",
    ", we could copy their arguments to conclude that straight runs are sufficiently sparse globally to deduce a superlinear lower bound for geodesic length .",
    "although fpp is built on i.i.d .",
    "weights , segments of geodesics are highly correlated , and such an independence assumption is not obviously true ( and is actually false in the non - critical case ) .",
    "so we need to show differently that hierarchies of nested cylinders can not contain too many straight runs by geodesics .",
    "the approach is to show that if geodesics do cross too many such cylinders , there is a high probability that many of these cylinders are `` slow '' ( in a sense described by near - critical percolation paths ) and force the passage time of geodesics to be large .",
    "we combine this with new upper bounds on passage times of geodesic segments using ideas from @xcite to conclude that straight runs are sparse .",
    "we will couple the fpp model to various percolation models . to do this ,",
    "we let @xmath49 be a collection of i.i.d .",
    "uniform @xmath50 random variables and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the generalized inverse @xmath53 then the variables @xmath54 are i.i.d . with distribution @xmath23 . for @xmath55 $ ] , an edge @xmath56 is called @xmath57-open if @xmath58 and @xmath57-closed otherwise .",
    "a path is a sequence of edges ( or their endpoints , or both ) such that each consecutive pair of edges shares an endpoint , and a circuit is a path which starts and ends at the same point .",
    "if @xmath59 is a path , we write @xmath60 for the number of edges in it . for @xmath61 , the box @xmath62",
    "is defined as @xmath63 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "next we define the dual lattice , which is used in section  [ sec : block ] .",
    "it is @xmath64 with its set of nearest - neighbor edges @xmath65 .",
    "an edge @xmath56 has exactly one dual edge @xmath66 that bisects it .",
    "we define variables @xmath67 by the rule @xmath68 and correspondingly use the terms @xmath57-open and @xmath57-closed .",

    "we give a brief outline of the proof of theorem  [ thm : main_thm ] .",
    "there are two parts : a block estimate , stated in theorem  [ thm : length_thm ] , and a block argument which upgrades this estimate to the stretched - exponential convergence in theorem  [ thm : main_thm ] .",

    "since this part is more standard , we focus here on the block estimate , theorem  [ thm : length_thm ] .",
    "two important things to notice about the statement in theorem  [ thm : length_thm ] are that ( a ) the geodesics referred to there are @xmath137-geodesics ; that is , they are minimal - weight paths restricted to a box @xmath138 and crossing the annulus @xmath139 ( this restriction is needed in the block argument ) , and ( b ) the estimate holds almost surely for all large @xmath90 .",
    "this second point is an upgrade from the argument given in the last subsection for : the event @xmath110 there only holds with positive probability .",
    "this means that , for example , we need to control geodesic lengths even on rare events in which no @xmath6-open paths ( or even near - critical paths ) cross the annulus .",
    "this makes a considerable difficulty , since the arguments of aizenman - burchard do not apply for highly supercritical paths .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : length_thm ] is itself split into two parts .",
    "the first is an almost sure bound on the passage time of paths that cross annuli , stated in proposition  [ prop : upper_bound ] .",
    "the main estimate there is that a type of maximal passage time @xmath140 of paths crossing the annulus @xmath141 satisfies @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a certain near - critical percolation parameter .",
    "similar bounds were shown in @xcite for @xmath144 , the minimal passage time from @xmath12 to points on the boundary of @xmath62 , but we can not use them for an annulus estimate .",
    "the reason is that if @xmath23 is critical and such that @xmath8 is stochastically bounded in @xmath9 , then the passage time of segments far from 0 are dominated heavily by those of segments near the origin .",
    "so we need to adapt their arguments to the annulus setting .    the proof of involves showing that with high probability , there are @xmath145-open circuits around 0 in @xmath146 and @xmath147 , with a @xmath145-open path connecting them .",
    "any geodesic crossing @xmath139 can be modified , replacing a portion of it with the union of these @xmath145-open paths , and we obtain an upper bound for @xmath140 by the passage time of these paths . to bound the passage time of these paths ,",
    "we show in lemma  [ lem : t_p ] ( as in @xcite ) that the only edges contributing to the passage time of these paths are ones which are @xmath145-open but @xmath6-closed , and which are associated to certain @xmath148-arm events .",
    "then we adapt moment bounds from @xcite for arm events in lemma  [ lem : kiss_lem ] to bound the number of such edges .",
    "once we have , we dive into the machinery of aizenman - burchard , analyzing the number of `` straight runs '' for geodesics . roughly speaking , for the length of a geodesic to be linear , it must pass clear ( have a straight run ) through many long thin cylinders at successively decreasing scales ( starting from scale @xmath149 ) .",
    "the main inequality from aizenman - burchard , stated as proposition  [ prop : tree ] , gives a lower bound for the @xmath150-_capacity _ of a path given that it does not have too many straight runs .",
    "this capacity is related to the length of the curve in lemma  [ lem : length_lemma ] , and thus what we must show is that with high probability , no geodesic crossing the annulus @xmath151 has straight runs through cylinders at more than half of the scales of the form @xmath152 from @xmath149 down to 1 , where @xmath153 is some large number .",
    "the difficulty here is that we do not have any precise description of geodesics in this model ( including their geometry ) , and the only information we have is the bound on @xmath140 above .    to show that geodesics have `` sparse '' straight runs , in section  [ sec : straight_runs ] , we prove that if a geodesic passes through a long thin cylinder , this cylinder has a high probability to be `` slow . '' in other words , it is likely that the cylinder is crossed in the short direction by at least 4 dual paths which are well - separated and have weight at least @xmath154 , where @xmath128 is related to the scale of the rectangle . by choosing this @xmath154 properly ,",
    "we show in proposition  [ prop : straight_runs ] that such a path would pass through enough slow cylinders at successive scales to have total passage time at least @xmath155 ( see ) , where @xmath145 is the near - critical parameter above in , giving a contradiction . in short ,",
    "if a geodesic does not have sparse straight runs , its passage time violates .",
    "we combine these tools in section  [ sec : main_proof ] to conclude the block estimate .",

    "we aim to show here :    [ thm : length_thm ] there exists @xmath10 such that almost surely , the following holds for all large @xmath90 : @xmath159    the proof is split into several sections . in section  [ sec : cylinder_times ] , we use tools from @xcite to estimate the minimal passage time across cylinders and then in section  [ sec : annulus_times ] , paste these together to get bounds for the passage time across annuli . in section",
    "[ sec : dimension_bounds ] , we use the machinery of aizenman - burchard to get lower bounds on the dimension of geodesics by estimating the number of `` straight runs '' they have : if they have too few , then they are forced to go through too many edges of nonzero passage time and they violate the passage time estimates from section  [ sec : annulus_times ] .",
