    "a simple classical example is the parallel transport of a vector along a closed curve on a sphere ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : paralleltransport ] ) .",
    "although the system returns to its initial state it aquires a geometric phase characterized by the enclosed area on the sphere ( gauss - bonnet theorem ) .",
    "a quantum - mechanical example is a system whose states are non - degenerate and which evolves adiabatically in the parameter space @xmath2 . in that case , the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath3 is given by@xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the time - evolved eigenstates and energies of the hamiltonian @xmath7 , @xmath8 defines the initial state , and @xmath9 is the famous berry phase .",
    "formally , the berry phase @xmath9 is given by the line integral of the so - called berry connection @xmath10 along the closed path @xmath11 : @xmath12 since the latter is a gauge - dependent vector - valued quantity it is also referred to as the berry vector potential , in analogy to electrodynamics .",
    "the berry phase , however , as a closed contour integral is independent of the gauge choice up to integer multiples of @xmath13 . by means of stokes",
    "theorem one can reformulate the berry phase in terms of a surface integral . for a three dimensional parameter space @xmath1 this defines the so - called berry curvature @xmath14 which takes a similar role as the magnetic field in electrodynamics ( see below ) .",
    "the generalization of the berry curvature to an arbitrary - dimensional parameter space is given by the antisymmetric rank-2 berry curvature tensor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .",
    "so far we have not specified the parameter space @xmath1 . in general , position and momentum degrees of freedom are coupled and therefore real - space , momentum - space , and even mixed berry phases occur simultaneously.@xcite in this paper , we focus on the limit , where mainly effects arising from berry phases collected in real - space are important",

    "note that for a particle with mass @xmath25 , charge @xmath26 , and land factor @xmath27 the magnetic moment @xmath24 and the spin @xmath28 are related by @xmath29 .",
    "in particular , for a free electron with charge @xmath30 the magnetic moment and the spin are antiparallel : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath33 denotes the vector of pauli matrices . in a ferromagnetic material ,",
    "the finite magnetization allows to define majority ( minority ) spins whose magnetic moments are parallel ( antiparallel ) to the magnetization direction .",
    "historically , in the magnetic materials community the majority and minority spins are referred to as `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' states , while in the semiconductor community `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' refers to the actual orientation of the electron spin . here , we follow the latter nomenclature .    in the adiabatic limit , the magnetic moment of",
    "the electron adapts constantly according to the local magnetization direction , and thereby the electron picks up a berry phase.@xcite from this point of view , the physical consequences of the real - space berry phase are `` hidden '' in the spatially and temporally varying spin states which enter the berry vector potential [ see eq .  ] , @xmath34 with @xmath35 representing minority and majority spins , respectively .",
    "note that minority and majority spins acquire opposite berry phases when traversing a magnetic texture .",
    "an intuitive way to understand this adiabatic berry phase physics is to consider a mapping onto a problem , where the electron moves in a uniform zeeman magnetic field , but instead `` feels '' an additional emergent electric field @xmath36 and an additional emergent ( orbital ) magnetic field @xmath37:@xcite    [ eq : emergentbandefield ] @xmath38    where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the local magnetization direction .",
    "it is important to note that these emergent fields lead to lorentz forces on the electrons that can be measured in experiments .",
    "for example , the emergent magnetic field leads directly to a contribution to the hall signal .",
    "since the profile of the magnetization configuration enters in @xmath37 , this type of hall signal can be denoted as a geometrical hall effect . in cases , where the magnetic texture is topologically nontrivial , it is commonly referred to the topological hall effect .",
    "note that the emergent electric field @xmath36 is only finite for a non - collinear , time - dependent magnetic texture . in sec .",
    "[ ssec : emergentelectricfield ] , we discuss the situation of a moving magnetic texture and its consequences for the corresponding hall signal .    in the following ,",
    "we derive the above emergent fields following ref .   and show that the emergent magnetic field is indeed the real - space berry curvature.@xcite the idea is to perform a _ local _ transformation @xmath41 , so that the second part of the hamiltonian becomes trivial : @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "hence , one has to rotate the quantization axis from the @xmath44-direction to the local magnetization direction @xmath45 .",
    "such a unitary transformation @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the angle of rotation , and @xmath49 is the rotation axis .",

    "furthermore , note that this transformation is exact .    for a magnetization texture @xmath17 which varies smoothly in space and time",
    ", one can treat the scalar and vector potentials @xmath57 and @xmath58 as a perturbation to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath59 . in the adiabatic approximation , @xmath57 and @xmath58 act on each band separately , allowing us to introduce electromagnetic potentials for both bands :    @xmath60    with @xmath35 for minority and majority spins , respectively , and @xmath61 .",
    "above potentials have the same form of the berry vector potential introduced in eq .  .",
    "finally , introducing for each band an emergent electric field , @xmath62 , and an emergent magnetic field , @xmath63 , that are `` felt '' by the electron , it becomes clear that the real - space berry curvature acts like an emergent magnetic field , while the mixed space - time berry curvature acts like an emergent electric field . by an explicit calculation one finds    @xmath64    where the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the band for electrons with minority ( majority ) spin .",
    "let us now assign different emergent charges to the two bands , because the sign of the berry phase depends on the orientation of the spin.@xcite for a minority ( majority ) spin we define@xcite @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) , leading to the emergent fields given in eq .  .    in principle ,",
    "any magnetic structure that varies smoothly in position space leads to an emergent magnetic field [ eq .  ] and thus to a geometrical hall effect . as it turns out ,",
    "there are ideal magnetic textures",
    " skyrmions  which are tailored to investigate these emergent fields .",
    "like the concept of the berry phase , a skyrmion is a certain mathematical object which is realized in many areas of physics ranging from nuclear and particle physics over high - energy physics to condensed matter physics . it is named after the nuclear physicist tony skyrme who in the early 1960 s studied a certain nonlinear field theory for interacting pions , showing that quantized and topologically stable field configurations  nowadays called skyrmions  do occur as solutions of such field theories.@xcite in the original work , skyrme considered three - dimensional versions of skyrmions , but later the notion of a skyrmion was generalized to arbitrary dimensions : one can define a skyrmion as a topologically stable , smooth field configuration describing a non - trivial surjective mapping from coordinate space to an order parameter space with a non - trivial topology . in the following ,",
    "we restrict the discussion to the two - dimensional unit sphere , @xmath67 , describing the magnetization direction @xmath68 .",
    "an intuive picture of a skyrmion and the mapping to a sphere is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : skyrmions ]  ( a ) , where `` infinity '' ( the boundary of the skyrmion ) is mapped onto the north pole .",
    "note that a skyrmion is everywhere non - singular and finite .",
    "in contrast to vortices , skyrmions are trivial at infinity , _",
    "i.e. _ , all arrows at the boundary point in the same direction out of plane .    .",

    ", scaledwidth=43.0% ]    at the end of the 1980 s skyrmion structures were shown to be the mean - field ground states of certain models for anisotropic , non - centrosymmetric magnetic materials with chiral spin - orbit interactions subjected to a magnetic field.@xcite although some further theoretical works appeared on magnetic skyrmions and similar textures,@xcite the real breakthrough was in 2009 when a hexagonal lattice of skyrmion - tubes perpendicular to a finite , external magnetic field [ as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : skyrmions ]  ( b ) ] was experimentally discovered in the cubic helimagnet manganese silicide ( mnsi).@xcite since 2009 skyrmions have been observed in many other b20 compounds@xcite , including metals , semiconductors , and also an insulating , multiferroic material.@xcite the skyrmion lattice was also confirmed to exist in thin films by a direct imaging of the real - space magnetic texture by lorentz transmission electron microscopy.@xcite moreover , skyrmion textures have been discussed in thin films in the form of magnetic bubble domains.@xcite furthermore , skyrmions have been found on surfaces as a spontaneous magnetic ground state forming a lattice on the atomic scale.@xcite    in skyrmion lattices , different length scales appear:@xcite the size of the atomic unit cell corresponding to the wavelength of the electrons , the diameter of the skyrmions , the ( non - spinflip ) mean - free path , and the much larger spinflip scattering length . in the adiabatic limit , where the size of the skyrmions is much larger than the non - spinflip scattering length ,",
    "band structure effects are negligible , and one can concentrate on real - space berry phases.@xcite in the opposite limit , band structure effects are expected to dominate , and momentum - space berry phases become relevant.@xcite    in b20 structures like mnsi a hierachy of energy scales exists which also determines the size of the skyrmion structures : ferromagnetic exchange coupling , dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , and crystalline field interactions .",
    "since the ratio of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya and the ferromagnetic exchange interaction is small in b20 structures , the diameter of a skyrmion is much larger than the crystallographic unit cell , and the skyrmion textures are smooth .",
    "consequently , those magnetic structures are good candidates to study the physics of real - space berry phases .",
    "skyrmions can be classified according to their integer winding number @xmath69 counting the number of times the field configuration wraps around the whole sphere . to obtain the winding number of a magnetization configuration which varies in the @xmath70 plane as the example shown in the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : skyrmions ]  ( a ) , one has to integrate the solid angle swept out by @xmath68 : @xmath71 comparing the winding number with the emergent fields [ cf.eq .",
    "] one observes that the emergent magnetic field is of particular interest for the skyrmion lattice : the topology of the skyrmion ensures the `` emergent magnetic flux '' per unit cell to be quantized , as can be seen by integrating eq .   over a magnetic unit cell ( uc ) : @xmath72 with @xmath73 for skyrmions in the chiral magnet mnsi@xcite where the @xmath74 axis is along the external magnetic field direction .",
    "the topological hall effect due to the emergent magnetic field was one of the first experimental confirmations that the magnetic textures observed in mnsi and other b20 structures have a topological character and are actually lattices of skyrmion tubes.@xcite note that the emergent fields   have been derived for a simple model , and therefore only a qualitative understanding of the experimental signatures is possible at this level . to obtain a quantitative agreement with experiments corrections due to non - adiabatic processes@xcite , fluctuations of the magnetization amplitude , modifications due to the band structure , etc .",
    "have to be taken into account .      as mentioned above , to observe the emergent electric field",
    "a time - dependent magnetic texture is needed .",
    "one way to obtain a moving magnetic texture is to exploit the spin - torque effect@xcite by sending a sufficiently large spin - polarized current through the sample which `` pushes '' the magnetic structure forward .",
    "usually a spin polarized current is obtained by sending an electric current through a sample with a finite magnetic moment , but there are also other options to create spin currents like thermal or magnetic field gradients or via the intrinsic spin hall effect.@xcite the spin torque effect allows , for example , to move ferromagnetic domain walls@xcite with the potentially application of racetrack memories.@xcite however , the threshold current density , above which the domain walls get unpinned from disorder , is very high , @xmath75 .",
    "a key feature of the smooth skyrmion lattice in chiral magnets is the very efficient coupling to electric currents .",
    "this is reflected in an ultra - low threshold current density above which the skyrmion lattice starts moving .",
    "for example , in mnsi,@xcite the threshold current density is five orders of magnitude smaller compared to the one for traditional spin - torque effects , @xmath76 .    for current densities well above the threshold current density ,",
    "a rigid skyrmion lattice moves mainly along the current direction with a drift velocity @xmath77 , and the relative speed between the spin current and the magnetic structure is reduced.@xcite for a rigid drifting magnetic texture with @xmath78 the emergent electric and magnetic fields [ eq .  ]",
    "are coupled since @xmath79 : @xmath80 thus , one can identify the emergent electric field of the skyrmion lattice by a reduction of the hall signal,@xcite because the effective forces on the electrons due to the emergent electric field are basically in opposite direction than the ones due to the emergent magnetic field .",
    "note that eq .",
    "reflects faraday s law of induction , indicating that a change of the magnetic flux causes an electric field .",
    "another interesting aspect is that one can determine the drift velocity @xmath77 from the same hall measurement by virtue of eq .   since the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion lattice is quantized . for more details and experimental results",
    "e.g. _ , ref .  .",
    "so far we have discussed the berry phase physics a conduction electron experiences when traversing a spatially and temporally inhomogeneous , smooth magnetic texture .",
    "let us now switch the perspective and consider the effects of the electrons on the magnetic texture .",
    "the magnetization dynamics can be modeled within the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation , an effective equation of motion for the slowly and smoothly varying magnetization direction of a magnetic texture with constant amplitude.@xcite here , we will not discuss the magnetization dynamics in detail , but rather consider the current - induced forces on a skyrmion texture from a qualitative point of view .",
    "the equation of the forces ( per skyrmion , per length , and per @xmath81 ) acting on the skyrmion lattice can be obtained from the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation using the thiele method and treating pinning physics phenomenologically ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  ):",
    "@xmath82 here , @xmath83 is the dissipative tensor , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are effective damping parameters , @xmath86 is an effective spin velocity , @xmath77 is the drift velocity of the magnetic texture , @xmath87 is the gyrocoupling vector , and @xmath88 is the phenomenological pinning force .",
    "basically there are three different types of forces acting on the skyrmion lattice when subjected to an electric current : two types of current - induced forces ( schematically shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magnuseffekt ] , for a non - moving skyrmion ) and pinning forces . in the absence of a current ( @xmath89 ) ,",
    "the skyrmion lattice is pinned by impurities and the underlying atomic lattice , _ i.e. _ , @xmath90 . turning on the electric current ,",
    "the current - induced forces are first fully compensated by the pinning force @xmath88.@xcite for larger current densities , the current - induced forces overcome the pinning forces and induce a translational motion of the magnetic texture : the first term of eq .   describes a dissipative or drag force draging the skyrmion lattice along the direction of the spin - current , while the second term of eq",
    ".   describes a force on the magnetic texture , which is commonly referred to as a magnus force .",
    "it can be understood ( according to newton s third law ) as the counter - force on the magnetic texture opposite to the lorentz force on the electrons due to the emergent electric fields .",
    "hence , this magnus force is related to berry phase physics , and occurs , in principle , for any inhomogeneous magnetic texture",
    ". however , it is not surprising that the magnus force is also particularly interesting in skyrmion lattices due to their topology . for the case of the skyrmion lattice",
    ", the gyrocoupling can be explicitly expressed in terms of the emergent magnetic field , @xmath91 , and is thus proportional to the winding number:@xcite thus , for zero drift velocity the magnus force is perpendicular to the direction of the spin current .",
    "note that the notion of a magnus force is chosen in analogy to classical mechanics where , for example , the magnus force acting on a spinning ball in viscous air leads to a bending of the ball s flight path ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : magnuseffekt ] , left panel )  famous examples are `` banana kicks '' in soccer . in the rest - frame of the ball , the origin of the magnus force ( depicted as the red thick arrow in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : magnuseffekt ] ) can be understood on a fairly simple level : for a non - spinning ball , the air passes the ball on both sides equally fast , and thus there are no net forces acting on the ball in perpendicular direction .",
    "however , for a rotating ball the air is accelerated on one side and decelerated on the other side so that the air is deflected .",
    "as the air experiences a force , the ball experiences the opposite force  the magnus force  according to newton s third law .    in the skyrmion case",
    "it is the lorentz force induced by the emergent magnetic field that deflects the current and which in turn leads to a counter - effect  the magnus force  on the magnetic texture .",
    "note , however , that this analogy is not complete , because , _",
    "e.g. _ , spin is not a conserved quantity .",
    "nevertheless , this picture helps to understand why skyrmion lattices couple efficiently to electric currents .",
    "current - induced spin - torque effects occur only when the magnetization changes in space or time .",
    "for spin structures like magnetic domain walls this is only a nanoscopic region , while in the skyrmion lattice the smooth twist of the local magnetization extends over macroscopic magnetic domains .",
    "in addition , a weak coupling to the underlying atomic lattice@xcite and a small pinning to disorder@xcite leads to the very low threshold current density for the smooth skyrmion lattice.@xcite this excellent coupling to electric currents makes skyrmion systems very interesting to study spin - torque effects as effects like joule heating and oersted magnetic fields created by the current are less disturbing .",
    "furthermore , it allows for fundamental spin - torque experiments in bulk materials , where surface effects that dominate in nanoscopic samples are small .    with that knowledge about skyrmions , their excitations@xcite , and how to move,@xcite rotate,@xcite and even merge them,@xcite skyrmions are not only a powerful laboratory system to study fundamental physics , but",
    "may really become relevant for technological applications .",
    "keeping skyrmion spintronics in mind , small devices and thus small magnetic textures ( where also momentum space berry phases are potentially relevant ) are of course desired .",
    "experimentally , it has been shown that the size of the skyrmions can be controlled to some extent by doping within the b20 structures.@xcite on the atomic scale , skyrmions have been observed as the ground state of an fe film on ir(111 ) substrates.@xcite as a starting point for magnetic storage technologies , the same group has recently achieved to write and erase single skyrmions by surface techniques.@xcite furthermore , a potential generalization of racetrack memories using skyrmions has been recently proprosed and investigated within micromagnetic simulations.@xcite as those magnetic skyrmions are of two - dimensional nature , it might also be interesting to look for new , two - dimensional storage devices , where the intrinsic properties of the skyrmions can be used even better .",

    "<S> ) combining the berry phase concepts with the physics of an electric current traversing a peculiar whirl - like magnetic texture first discovered@xcite in 2009  magnetic skyrmions  reveals the elegance of these phases in a vivid way .    this paper is structured as follows : </S>",
    "<S> first , we review the general concept of berry phases and introduce the main formulas . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : realspaceberryphases ] , we focus on real - space berry phase effects . here </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the example of a free electron traversing a spatially or temporally inhomogeneous , smooth magnetic structure . in the adiabatic limit </S>",
    "<S> , the magnetic moment of the electron adjusts constantly to the local magnetization direction and thereby the electron picks up a berry phase . to interpret the physical consequences of these berry phases , we review the mapping onto a problem , where the electron moves in a uniform zeeman magnetic field , but instead `` feels '' an emergent electric field and an emergent orbital magnetic field , leading , for example , to the topological hall effect@xcite . in sec .  [ </S>",
    "<S> sec : skyrmions ] , we first introduce skyrmions in a formal way and then later focussing on skyrmions in magnetic systems , in particular those in a certain material class denoted as b20 materials . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss that those magnetic textures are tailormade to observe the emergent electric fields introduced in sec .  </S>",

    "<S> [ ssec : skyrmionspintronics ] we switch the perspective and discuss the back reaction of the electronic berry phase effects on the skyrmion lattice . </S>"
