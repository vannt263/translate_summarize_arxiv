    "the observational basis is that the period ratio @xmath11 $ ] tends to deviate from unity , where @xmath12 denotes the period of the fundamental mode , and @xmath13 denotes that of its @xmath0 overtone with @xmath14 the first evidence for such a behavior was presented by  @xcite using trace 171  imaging data , where @xmath15 was found to be @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the two cases examined therein , which were corroborated by a further study of the same events  . examining a new event also imaged by trace in its 171  passband , this latter study yielded a value for @xmath15 of @xmath18",
    "actually , periods of even higher - order overtones were also detected both in trace data   ( see also  @xcite  @xcite ) and in the _ nobeyama radioheliograph _ ( norh ) data  @xcite . in the former study , @xmath15 and @xmath19",
    "were found to be 0.99 and 0.965 , respectively . in the latter ,",
    "these read @xmath20 and @xmath16 . among the mechanisms that may contribute to the departure of @xmath1 from unity , for thin euv loops",
    "it is concluded that the density stratification   ( see also the review by  @xcite  @xcite ) and lateral expansion   along the loop play the most prominent role .",
    "the direct observational consequence is that one may deduce the longitudinal density scale height @xmath21 $ ] using @xmath22 , as was first advocated by  @xcite , and may combine @xmath22 and @xmath23 to simultaneously determine @xmath24 as well as the spatial scale for the loop lateral expansion  .",
    "fundamental or global sausage modes together with their first overtones were also detected in flaring loops with norh   and in cool h@xmath25 loops  @xcite . in the former ,",
    "@xmath15 was found to be @xmath26 with @xmath27  seconds and @xmath28  seconds . in the latter ,",

    "is not as popular as in the case of standing kink modes .",
    "rather , more attention was paid to the cutoff loop width - to - length ratio , only beyond which can trapped standing sausage modes be supported .",
    "for instance , capitalizing on this cutoff , @xcite deduced that the sausage oscillations measured using radio instruments with observing frequencies ranging from @xmath32  mhz to @xmath33  ghz prior to the 2000s were likely to be confined in a loop segment instead of perturbing the entire loop . for loops with width - to - length ratios smaller than the cutoff",
    ", sausage modes are no longer trapped but become leaky . however , this change of nature does not mean that these modes are not observationally irrelevant : the damping timescale of the leaky modes can be sufficiently longer than their periods , making their detection possible in oscillating signals of coronal loops with realistic parameters , as shown recently by  @xcite .",
    "the effects of a field - aligned flow in coronal loops on the standing modes that they support were often neglected . while this is justifiable when the flow speeds are well below the alfvn speed , as was assessed for kink modes supported by thin tubes  @xcite , loop flows are not necessarily always weak .",
    "in fact , speeds in the alfvnic regime ( @xmath34  km  s@xmath35 ) associated with explosive events have been reported  .",
    "alternatively , as was pointed out by  @xcite , speeds of similar magnitude can be independently inferred from the spatial distributions of the phases associated with standing kink modes along loops such as those reported by  @xcite using trace and soho data .",
    "if the effects of such a strong flow are neglected , then the loop magnetic field strength would be seriously underestimated with the standard seismological practice , by a factor of three to be precise  @xcite .",
    "the present study is intended to provide a comprehensive investigation into the flow effects on standing modes supported by coronal loops modeled by a zero-@xmath36 slab , where @xmath36 is the ratio of the thermal to the magnetic pressure .",
    "similar studies on cylinder - supported kink modes were carried out by  @xcite and more recently by  @xcite , both adopting the thin - tube limit and assuming weak flow speeds well below the alfvn speed . in the slab case , the most relevant one seems to be that by  (; hereafter mr11 ) where an exhaustive analytical study on the period ratio @xmath37 $ ] for static zero-@xmath36 slabs was conducted .",
    "our previous work  @xcite ( hereafter article i ) adopted also a slab geometry , and examined in detail how the flows , which are allowed to reach the alfvnic range , influence @xmath15 of both kink and sausage modes for slabs with arbitrary width - to - length ratios in both a coronal and a photospheric environment .",
    "the present study extends both mr11 and article i in three ways : first , as observations are not restricted to the first overtone but show the existence of even higher ones , we will examine how the flows affect overtones with @xmath2 being up to four . by doing this",
    ", we will show that measuring simultaneously three periods will lead one to determine the density contrast @xmath38 $ ] and the internal alfvn mach number @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "second , as shown by article  i , the flow effects may be best brought out by examining , say , whether the minimum @xmath1 is subject to the lower limits expected for static slabs",
    ". we will extend mr11 to overtones of arbitrary order @xmath40 $ ] by establishing the lower limits of @xmath1 for static slabs : while they are to be analytically derived for slabs with an epstein density profile , we show that they also hold for slabs with density profiles taking a step - function form .",
    "third , regarding coronal sausage oscillations , article  i showed that the most prominent influence a flow has is to increase the critical width - to - length ratio @xmath41 $ ] required for standing sausage modes to be trapped . we will extend this by conducting a parameter study of @xmath42 , and come up with an analytical fit that depends only on @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "this simple formula will then be applied to demonstrate how the simple fact that a standing sausage mode exists in a coronal loop can constrain the combination of @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , it allows us to further the study by  @xcite of the partial sausage modes .",
    "this article is organized as follows : section  [ sec_static_slab ] examines static slabs , with the purpose of establishing the behavior of @xmath1 in general , and its lower limit in particular .",
    "then section  [ sec_flow_slabs ] examines in detail how introducing a field - aligned flow affects standing modes , with particular attention paid to the period ratios for kink and sausage modes alike , as well as the cutoff width - to - length ratio for sausage modes .",
    "section  [ sec_conc ] summarizes the present study .",

    "the background magnetic field @xmath45 $ ] is uniform , whereas the background density @xmath46 $ ] is structured along the @xmath47-direction , resulting in a non - uniform alfvn speed @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "two forms of @xmath49 are examined : one is the epstein profile  @xcite while the other is a step - function form .",
    "the former enables a fully analytic exploration of the period ratios of the standing modes supported by static slabs  . exploiting this analytical tractability",
    ", we will derive the expressions for the period ratios @xmath11 $ ] associated with overtones of arbitrary order @xmath40 $ ] , their approximations in a number of physically interesting limits , and their lower limits .",
    "the purpose is to show that , while these properties are established for this particular profile , they apply also to the case of a step - function profile , which is easier to implement numerically , and which is the profile to be used when field - aligned flows are introduced .",
    "the epstein profile is @xmath50 as shown in figure  [ fig_slab_illus ] , this density profile continuously connects the asymptotic value @xmath51 $ ] to a maximum @xmath52 $ ] over a characteristic spatial scale @xmath53 $ ] . the ratio @xmath54 $ ] evaluates the density contrast @xmath38 $ ] .",

    "we restrict ourselves to trapped linear waves that propagate only in the @xmath47@xmath44-plane .",
    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 represent their angular frequency and longitudinal wavenumber .",

    "hence the @xmath63-dependence of @xmath73 translates into the dependence on the aspect ratio @xmath74 $ ] of the period ratios @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath1 depends also on @xmath3 .",
    "actually , @xmath1 is determined by these two parameters , and these two only .          in this case ,",
    "for kink waves the dispersion relation reads  ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath75 which leads to a general expression for the period ratios @xmath76 by deriving equation  ( [ pr - e - kink ] ) we have presented an expression for @xmath77 that is valid for overtones of arbitrary order .",

    "the lower limit of period ratios @xmath1 turns out to be of particular interest , and can be derived in two steps .",
    "first , one notices that @xmath1 at any positive @xmath61 decreases with increasing @xmath83 as long as @xmath84 .",
    "second , @xmath1 in the limit @xmath85 has the asymptotic form @xmath86 for any finite aspect ratio @xmath74 $ ] . hence the lower limit for @xmath1 is @xmath87 , attained when the density contrast approaches infinity and the aspect ratio approaches zero .    for sausage waves ,",
    "the dispersion relation reads   @xmath88 consequently , one finds a general expression for the period ratios @xmath89 which generalizes equation  ( 33 ) in mr11 , where only the first overtone is concerned , to overtones with arbitrary order @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "concerning sausage waves , a number of analytically tractable properties are of interest .",
    "the first concerns the dispersion behavior in the wide - slab limit @xmath81 $ ] , in which case @xmath77 reads @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the same as in equation  ( [ kink0wide ] ) .",

    "the second concerns the lower bound that @xmath77 may attain .",
    "one first notices that @xmath77 as a function of @xmath93 decreases with @xmath83 at any positive @xmath61 when @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , when the density contrast @xmath85 , one finds that @xmath94 finally , a cutoff wavenumber exists   @xmath95 below which the waves are no longer trapped . going a step further",
    ", one finds an aspect ratio cutoff @xmath96      in this case the dispersion relation reads   @xmath97 for kink waves , and @xmath98 for sausage waves . as in the case where the epstein profile is adopted , for sausage waves to be trapped , the longitudinal wavenumber has to be larger than a cutoff   @xmath99 consequently , a cutoff aspect ratio exists @xmath100 only beyond which can standing sausage modes be trapped .    evaluating the period ratios @xmath11 $ ] in the step function case can in principle",

    "now let us evaluate how sensitively the period ratios depend on the profile that the density inhomogeneity adopts .",

    "so the point that we make here is that if a loop undergoes standing kink oscillations , and if the oscillating signals contain periods of both the fundamental and its first and second overtones , then with the measured periods one can readily derive simultaneously the density contrast of the loop with its surroundings and the internal alfvn mach number : neither of these two is easy to measure directly from an observational standpoint .",

    ", we generalize the study by   to overtones of arbitrary order , and establish the lower bound that @xmath1 may attain . solving the static - slab problem where the density profile is of a step - function form instead , we find that these lower limits also hold",

    "this is true even when @xmath3 is very large  ( the solid curves in figure  [ fig_flow_kink_pr_min_as_ma ] ) , in which case while for static slabs @xmath1 almost reaches the analytically expected lower limit @xmath235 $ ] , they may be reduced by @xmath236 $ ] for @xmath2 being @xmath186 $ ] for the alfvn mach number @xmath39 $ ] in the range of @xmath237 $ ] . for lower , and therefore more realistic , density contrasts ,",
    "the flow effect is even stronger .",
    "3 .   a way of deducing simultaneously @xmath3 and @xmath6 , pertinent to standing kink modes , is illustrated in figure  [ fig_flow_knk_pr_contour ] .",
    "the idea is simply that , if the main contributor to the departure of @xmath1 from unity is the wave dispersion due to transverse structuring in density and flow speeds , then at a given aspect ratio , if @xmath1 with two different @xmath2 are measured , the combination of @xmath10 may be readily read out from a contour plot similar to figure  [ fig_flow_knk_pr_contour ] . in fact , if an additional overtone is also measured , an uncertainty measure of the deduced @xmath10 can be readily deduced .",
    "4 .   for standing sausage modes supported by flowing slabs , the flow effect on @xmath1 is not as strong but still substantial in reducing their values at a given slab aspect ratio .",
    "however , in the flowing case @xmath1 is still bounded by the lower limit @xmath116 established for static slabs , the reason being that the flow significantly enhances the cutoff aspect ratio , below which sausage modes are no longer trapped .",
    "a parameter study on the cutoff aspect ratio for standing sausage modes @xmath117 $ ] yields that it may be satisfactorily approximated by equation  ( [ eq_flow_saus_cut_fit ] ) , which involves @xmath3 and @xmath6 in a simple manner , when @xmath3 is in the range of @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath6 in the range @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "this simple formula allows one to analytically constrain @xmath3 and @xmath6 making use of only the fact that a loop experiences standing sausage oscillations .",
    "provided that the aspect ratio is known , if the density contrast is found as well , then one readily derives the upper limit for @xmath6 .",
    "the simple formula of equation  ( [ eq_flow_saus_cut_fit ] ) enables us to deduce that , if the baumbach ",
    "allen model can describe the density of the ambient corona , and if the loops in radio observations with observing frequencies lower than @xmath33  ghz as compiled by  @xcite correspond to a width - to - length ratio of @xmath211 , then only the segment at heights above @xmath230 ( @xmath238 )  mm can experience a partial sausage oscillation when @xmath6 is @xmath231 ( 0.4 ) , which are substantially higher than @xmath229  mm found in the static case .",
