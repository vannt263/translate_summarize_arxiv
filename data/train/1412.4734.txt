    "following the completion of the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) mission in 2000 , seven gamma - ray pulsars were known to exist",
    ". a combined total of 37 photons with energies exceeding 10  gev were observed from five of these pulsars by the egret instrument on - board cgro @xcite .",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) has now detected over 160 gamma - ray pulsars ( see for a review ) and pulsar studies presented in the _ fermi_-lat catalog of sources above 10  gev ( 1fhl ) have shown that 20 of these pulsars have _ fermi_-lat detections above 10  gev , with 12 also seen at energies above 25  gev @xcite .",
    "one common feature exhibited by all known gamma - ray pulsars is the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which can be described by a power law followed by a spectral break occurring between 1 and 10 gev @xcite .",
    "the 12 pulsars observed above 25  gev are largely drawn from the brightest of the _ fermi _ pulsars ( f@xmath4s@xmath1@xmath2 ) and thus are sufficiently bright to be detected by _ fermi _ at these energies even as their spectrum falls rapidly above the break . the most favored general description of gamma - ray emission from pulsars in the _ fermi _ era postulates that electrons are accelerated in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "this acceleration is limited by the radiation of synchrotron and curvature photons , leading to spectral cut - offs .",
    "outer - magnetospheric models ( outer - gap or slot - gap models ) that implement this emission framework can , in general , reproduce the pulsar light curves and seds measured by the _ fermi_-lat .    recently the vela pulsar - the brightest known gamma - ray pulsar - has been detected at energies above 30  gev by h.e.s.s . and",

    "the power - law extension of the crab pulsar sed measured above the gev break by veritas @xcite and magic @xcite can not be easily explained by curvature emission from the outer magnetosphere @xcite unless the radius of curvature of the magnetic field line is larger than the radius of the light cylinder @xcite .",
    "some recent models attribute the pulsed very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath5100  gev ) emission from the crab pulsar to inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering originating in the outer magnetosphere @xcite or to ic scattering from beyond the light cylinder @xcite . the question of whether crab - pulsar - like non - exponentially - suppressed vhe spectra are common in other gamma - ray pulsars , such as geminga , has meaningful implications for our understanding of the physics of particle acceleration and emission from pulsars .    located at a distance of @xmath3200  pc @xcite , the geminga pulsar is the second - brightest steady gev source in the gamma - ray sky and is the original `` radio - quiet '' pulsar .",

    "originally detected as an unidentified source of @xmath3100  mev gamma - ray emission by the sas-2 and cos - b instruments , its nature as a pulsar was established following the detection of pulsed x - ray emission in data recorded by the rosat satellite @xcite .",
    "reanalysis of the cos - b and sas-2 data , using the pulsar timing solution determined from the rosat data , confirmed the mev source to be a gamma - ray pulsar @xcite .",
    "analysis of the available egret data further confirmed the identification @xcite .",
    "the pulsed x - ray source is composed of thermal radiation from hot - spots on the surface of the neutron star and non - thermal magnetospheric emission @xcite .",
    "detailed gamma - ray observations of the geminga pulsar have been made with the egret , _ agile _ and _ fermi _ space telescopes @xcite .",
    "repeated radio searches have failed to find a radio - pulsar counterpart @xcite while optical and uv pulsations have been reported at the 3.5@xmath8 and 5@xmath8 level , respectively @xcite .",
    "the geminga pulsar has been a target for ground - based very - high - energy gamma - ray detectors for over two decades .",
    "limits on the pulsed gamma - ray flux in the tev regime at the @xmath310% crab nebula level have been reported by the whipple , hegra and pact collaborations @xcite , while the ootacamund , durham and crimean groups have reported weak evidence ( @xmath33@xmath8 level ) for pulsed emission at the @xmath350 - 100% crab nebula level @xcite .",
    "given the far higher sensitivity of current ground - based gamma - ray arrays , it seems likely that these reported excesses are due to statistical fluctuations . at multi - tev energies , an unpulsed and spatially extended source attributed to the geminga pulsar wind nebula",
    "@xcite has been detected at the @xmath320% crab nebula level by the milagro water - cherenkov telescope @xcite .",

    "the p2 break energy , 2.78@xmath90.04  gev , does exceed the maximal curvature break energy within the adopted outer - magnetospheric emission framework .",

    "this , in addition to the compatibility of the power law shape with the high energy data , positions geminga as a viable candidate for inverse - compton emission .",
