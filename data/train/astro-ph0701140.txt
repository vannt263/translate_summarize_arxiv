    "a few years ago @xcite discovered an apparent over - density of m - giant stars in the direction of the constellation canis major ( cma ) , using 2mass data .",
    "they also reported that the structure was surrounded by a number of globular and open clusters .",
    "combined with the fact that it is located at low galactic latitudes , just below the plane of the disk of the milky way , led them to conclude that it may well be the ( remnant of a ) disrupted dwarf galaxy that could have spawned the so - called monoceros stellar stream . that stellar stream had been discovered some years prior @xcite and seems to surround the galaxy completely at very low galactic latitudes .",
    "numerical simulations show that such a system can be explained by an in - plane accretion event ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent deep photometric observations @xcite , kinematic studies @xcite and analysis of 2mass data @xcite are in accord with this scenario .",
    "the optical photometry also revealed the presence of a young main sequence population of stars potentially at the same distance .",
    "the initial analysis of a new wide - field survey of the cma region revealed that the projected distribution of the young stars is qualitatively similar to the older population @xcite .",
    "however , other explanations for the observed stellar over - density have been offered . @xcite and @xcite argued that the observed stellar over - densities towards cma reflect the warp and flare of the outer disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that the intrinsic substructure of the disk such as spiral arms can explain the observations if they are not in the plane of the disk . in this picture the young main sequence ( yms ) population is related to the outer cygnus spiral arm , while the older main sequence ( oms ) feature is caused by disk stars in the inter - arm region between the cygnus and perseus spiral arms . in the latter scenario the oms and yms populations would be located at different distances and not actually co - spatial .",
    "the generic problem with the interpretation of the observed features is that since they are lying so close to the plane of the disk it is a priori not clear if they are intrinsic to the disk or have an outside origin .",
    "we are performing a large photometric survey of the cma over - density using the wide field imager ( wfi ) on the eso / mpg 2.2 m telescope at la silla .",
    "based on a relatively straightforward analysis of the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) we have estimated the line - of - sight ( l.o.s . )",
    "depth of the over - density and its spatial extent in ( * ? ? ?",
    "the picture that emerged is that of an old stellar over - density that is highly elongated in galactic longitude with a projected aspect ratio of @xmath35:1 , consistent with recent 2mass analyses @xcite .",
    "the yms stars show qualitatively a similar projected distribution but are markedly more localized , both in galactic longitude and latitude with a maximum near ( @xmath4,@xmath5)@xmath0(240,-7 ) . for the extent of the over - density along the l.o.s .",
    ", @xmath1 , b06 found upper limits of 1.8 and 1.5 kpc for the oms and yms respectively , assuming an average distance of 7.5 kpc for both populations .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to extract more information from the photometry by applying more sophisticated cmd - fitting methods .",
    "in particular we are interested whether the oms and yms over - density populations seen towards cma can be co - spatial , based on our optical photometry .",
    "we also constrain the metallicity of the yms stars , which has so far not been constrained . to do this",
    "we apply cmd - fitting techniques to a small selection of fields towards the likely maximum of the cma over - density from our large photometric survey .",
    "fitting of cmds with model stellar populations enables use of the full distribution of stars within a cmd .",
    "methods to obtain detailed information on the star formation and chemical enrichment history of composite stellar systems have been proven to be very successful ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it uses maximum - likelihood techniques to find the linear combination of single - component stellar population models that best fits an observed hess diagram ( stellar density as function of color and magnitude ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : datameth ] describes the data and methods used . in sections [ sec : scfits ] and [ sec : distfits ] the results of our fits are presented and their implications are discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "this analysis is based on deep b , r photometry obtained with the wide field imager ( wfi ) at the eso / mpg 2.2 m telescope at la silla .",
    "these data are part of an extensive survey of the canis major region , presented in b06 . because of the amount of data involved",
    ", the data reduction used for the complete survey as described by b06 is fully automated .",
    "for the analysis in this paper , accurate calibration of the photometry is critical .",
    "we use the same reduced image data , which are overscan , bias , flat - field and astrometrically corrected using a pre - reduction pipeline @xcite , but individually re - calibrate the magnitudes for our cma fields to ensure the best possible photometric accuracy .",
    "standard star fields taken on the same night ( 2004 december 9 ) as three of the cma fields were used to determine the zero - points , color terms and airmass correction factors .",
    "the values found were very close to the ones provided by eso .",
    "based on these standard star measurements we estimate the color calibration accuracy to be 5% .",
    "object detection was performed using sextractor @xcite , after which psf - fitting photometry was done with the iraf task daophot / allstar .",
    "fake star tests were also done by adding artificial stars to the images using an empirical psf measured from stars in the image and subsequently running the same detection and photometry routines .",
    "six sets of 1000 artificial stars spread over a wide magnitude range ( 15 - 24 for b - band , 14 - 23 for r - band ) were used for each image , giving 6000 fake stars per image . for the analysis presented here",
    "we will only go down to magnitudes of 22 in b and 21 in r. figure [ fig : completeness ] shows that the data are complete to @xmath080% complete or better at these limits .",
    "typical photometric errors at these magnitudes are 0.05 mag and better at brighter magnitudes .",
    "the cmd fitting software needs artificial star files with large numbers of stars spread over the whole magnitude and color range used .",
    "b - band and r - band artificial star data are randomly combined within a color range of -1.0@xmath6b - r@xmath63.0 to create lists of more than 80,000 entries for each field .",

    "since the yms is spatially less extended than the oms ( b06 ) , we chose to use fields near the presumed center of the over - density at ( @xmath4,@xmath5)=(240,-7 ) . in order to see whether the properties of the oms change with galactic latitude we also want to study some fields farther away from the plane . to be able to check for internal errors we choose to use 2 fields near the presumed center of cma and 2 fields that are at a latitude of @xmath8 .",
    "since the cma over - density is located at very low galactic latitudes , just south of the plane of the disk , the number of fore- and background disk stars is very high .",
    "this necessitates the use of control fields in our analysis , and appropriate fields need to be selected for this purpose as well .",
    "because of the location of the cma over - density close to the galactic plane , the extinction in the observed fields is high and increasing along the l.o.s .. furthermore , the extinction correction in b06 has shown that the extinction estimates from @xcite and @xcite in some cases seem to overestimate and in others to underestimate the actual extinction .",
    "this is problematic for our analysis since an unknown extinction introduces large uncertainties in the cmd - fitting analysis due to the degeneracies between extinction , age , metallicity and distance .",
    "to minimize these uncertainties we select fields with relatively low ( but certainly still significant ) extinction for our analysis .",
    "table [ tab : fields ] lists the coordinates and average extinction values of the selected fields , where c1 and c2 correspond to the `` central '' fields , i.e. near the cma center ( @xmath9 - 7 ) , and o1 and o2 to the `` outer '' fields ( @xmath10 - 11 ) .",
    "also listed are the fields that will be used to construct control fields . for fields c1 and c2 a field at similar longitude and similar latitude north of the disk plane will be used for control field ; this field shows no significant contribution of cma stars and is listed in table [ tab : fields ] as cbg .",
    "since fields farther away from the plane contain much less stars , we combine cmds from three fields at low latitude to construct control fields for the fields o1 and o2 . these three control fields ( obg1 , obg2 and obg3 in table [ tab : fields ] )",
    "are selected to contain no or very few cma stars and to have similar extinction as fields o1 and o2 .",
    "the locations of the selected fields are plotted in figure [ fig : locations ] , together with contours indicating the extinction in the galactic plane . in figure",
    "[ fig : cmacmds ] the cmds of the cma target fields are shown , and in figure [ fig : controlcmds ] the cmds of the control fields .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , quantitative and algorithmic cmd ( or hess diagram ) fitting methods have proven themselves and several software packages have been developed for this aim @xcite . the software package we use is match , which was written and successfully used for the cmd analysis of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the software works by converting the observed cmd into a hess diagram and comparing that with hess diagrams of model populations .",
    "a hess diagram is a two - dimensional histogram of stellar density as function of color and magnitude",
    ". theoretical isochrones ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in the case of match ) are convolved with a model of the photometric accuracy and completeness , obtained from the artificial star test data , to create the model hess diagrams .",
    "the use of hess diagrams enables a pixel - by - pixel comparison and a maximum - likelihood technique is used to find the best - fitting linear combination of models . to account for contamination by fore- and background stars ,",
    "a control field cmd can be provided .",
    "match will then use the control field hess diagram as an extra ` model population ' .",
    "the resulting output will be the best - fitting linear combination of population models plus the control field .",
    "previously match was used in a mode where extinction and distance are fixed and the best - fitting combination of models with different age and metallicity are found . for the application described in this paper , we have used match in somewhat different modes , namely one where distance is a free parameter and one where only simple , single component models are fit to the data and compared based on their goodness - of - fit .    match",
    "was originally developed for systems where all stars can be assumed to be at the same distance , i.e. external galaxies . in the case of the cma over - density",
    "this approximation does not apply , as it is relatively nearby and has a significant extent along the l.o.s .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , it is possible that the oms and yms populations are only co - spatial in projection and actually at different distances @xcite . thus , there are two effects we need to cope with , namely distance spread of populations and distance offsets between populations .",
    "accounting for a distance spread can be done in a straightforward way by manipulating the photometric error model ; adding random offsets with a normal distribution to the recovered magnitudes of the artificial stars will smooth the model hess diagram along the magnitude axis with the same @xmath11 . to fit populations at different distances",
    "simultaneously we have implemented a new way in which to run match that keeps the same number of free parameters , or parameter dimensions , to be explored . in the standard mode ,",
    "the distance is fixed , while age and metallicity are independent variables . here",
    ", the distance becomes a free parameter , but age and metallicity are being limited via a specified age metallicity relation ( amr ) . for any given amr",
    "there is only one `` population parameter '' , e.g. age with a certain metallicity linked to each age bin .",
    "of course , different amrs can be explored , ultimately permitting a wide range of age - metallicity relations .",
    "in general , amrs should be chosen that are appropriate for the specific application , based on expected or known metallicity evolution .",
    "for example , for the study of structures in the galactic thin disk one would consider a different amr than for the study of a metal - poor dwarf galaxy .",
    "however , within this new mode of running match the choice of amr is very flexible and a flat amr ( no dependence of metallicity on age ) or even an amr where metallicity decreases with time is possible . in section [ sec : distfits ] of this paper we will use two different amrs to constrain how the assumed metallicity influences the distances found through cmd - fitting .",
    "because of the large contamination of the cma cmds with fore- and background stars , a feature like the red giant branch ( rgb ) is observed at very low contrast .",
    "the main sequence ( ms ) is the only feature that is observed with high contrast and significance , and match can fit the location of the ms and the ms turn - off ( msto ) , as well as the density of stars along the ms . to constrain the basic parameters of cma  distance , age range , and average metallicity  we first use match in a single component ( sc ) fitting mode ; in this mode , template stellar population models are created that consist of a single component with fixed distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range .",
    "such a sc template is fit to the data together with a control field .",
    "since the template consists of a single component , the only free parameters during the fit are the absolute scaling of ( i.e. the number of stars in ) the template and the control field . for each template ( i.e. for each combination of distance , foreground extinction , age range and metallicity range ) , taken by itself ,",
    "a value of the goodness - of - fit is obtained .",
    "based on the goodness - of - fit values we can then find the best - fitting template and thus constrain the overall properties of the cma yms and oms populations .",
    "a paper describing the application of these new modes of application of match , including tests and simulations is in preparation ( j.t.a . de jong et al .",
    "2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "it should be noted that the results of cmd fits depend on the assumed set of theoretical stellar evolution models . when match was written , the only set of isochrones with full age and metallicity coverage available was provided by @xcite .",
    "since match only uses one set of isochrones , this adds a further source of uncertainty to our fit results .    from the cmds presented here and in b06 , the oms and yms seem to be two distinct populations . in section",
    "[ sec : scfits ] we first study the populations separately using sc template fits . to better study the relation between these two populations , we also fit them simultaneously using the new capability of match to solve for distance .",

    "also the sc fit results for the yms are internally consistent .",
    "again the extinction values are close to the @xcite values , although now slightly lower .",
    "since the yms is expected to be equidistant with or behind the oms rather than in front of it , the extinction towards the yms can of course not be lower than towards the oms in reality .    despite the fact that for the yms no distinct msto is observed , the ages are better constrained than for the oms , because contamination by fore- and background stars is not a serious problem .",
    "all fits within 1@xmath11 of the best fit have an upper age limit age@xmath15 of 2 gyr .",
    "moreover , in the case of field c2 , all acceptable fits have the same age bin of 0.25 - 2 gyr , meaning that all other age bins give fits that are at least 1@xmath11 worse than the best fit .",
    "for both fields the oldest age bin ( 2 to 5 gyr ) is excluded with more than 99% confidence , arguing a posteriori that a distinction of oms and yms is sensible .",
    "also all age bins with an age@xmath15 less than 100 myr are excluded with more than 99% confidence .",
    "according to our results , the youngest stars in the yms must be at least as young as @xmath0700 myr and the oldest at most 2 gyr old .",
    "thus , from our fits the yms seems to consist of stars with ages between a few hundred million years and 2 gyr .",
    "these estimates agree with those of @xcite , but are older than found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the best - fit metallicity is more metal - rich than that of the oms , [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 0.3 , and in that case the yms is somewhat more distant than the oms , namely 9.1 and 9.5 kpc in c1 and c2 , respectively , but with large uncertainties .",
    "as will be discussed in more detail below , due to the degeneracy between these parameters , they are not well constrained individually .",
    "the measured l.o.s .",
    "dispersion in field c1 is similar to that of the oms , but a bit smaller in field c2 . at their respective best - fitting distances the recovered l.o.s .",
    "dispersions for the yms in c1 and c2 correspond to a @xmath1 of @xmath01.8 kpc and @xmath01.3 kpc .    based on the best - fit parameters from table [ tab : scresults ] we can reconstruct what the cmds of our fields would look like if there were only cma stars present without any contamination by fore- and background stars .",
    "using the isochrones from @xcite , assuming a standard salpeter imf , and applying the photometric errors and completeness of our data , gives realistic representations of our best - fit sc models .",
    "the resulting cmds in figure [ fig : modelcmds ] show an approximate , ` clean ' picture of the cma overdensity in fields c1 , c2 , o1 and o2 . comparing figure [ fig : modelcmds ] with figure [ fig : cmacmds ] nicely illustrates the amount of contamination we have to deal with .",
    "one of the key questions in the cma debate is whether the young and old stellar over - densities are physically related or not .",
    "although the values in table [ tab : scresults ] suggest at first glance that the yms may actually be farther away and half a dex more metal - rich than the oms , the degeneracy between metallicity and distance prohibits a secure determination of this .",
    "figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] shows the goodness - of - fit contours in the metallicity vs. distance modulus plane for the yms ( dashed ) and oms ( solid ) in fields c1 and c2 . to remove another degeneracy ,",
    "the foreground extinction was fixed to 1.1 for c1 and 0.7 for c2 , but all age bins and @xmath1 bins were included for making these plots .",
    "the direction of the degeneracy is obvious , with the best - fit distance increasing for increasing metallicity .",
    "while for these foreground extinction values the metallicity of the oms is relatively robustly determined at [ fe / h]=-0.8 , the metallicity constraint for the yms is not strong .",
    "if the yms is significantly more metal - rich than the oms , it must be more distant .",
    "however , as the contours in figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] indicate , our fits are also consistent with the yms having a similar metallicity to the oms , in which case it would be at the same distance as the oms .",
    "while in the previous sections the yms and oms populations were treated separately , we now proceed to fit the complete cmds of fields c1 and c2 . using the distance fitting mode of match",
    "( see section [ sec : cmdfitting ] ) we will try to confirm the distances obtained in the previous section and look again at the possible distance offset between the two populations .    in the distance fitting mode of the match fitting , the age bins to be used have to be specified as well as a fixed metallicity for each age bin .",
    "we use eight age bins with limits in log(years ) of 7.5 to 8.0 , 8.0 to 8.5 , 8.5 to 9.0 , 9.0 to 9.3 , 9.3 to 9.5 , 9.5 to 9.7 , 9.7 to 9.9 and 9.9 to 10.1 .",
    "based on the results from the previous section we expect to find yms stars in some of the four youngest age bins and oms stars in some of the four oldest .",
    "as the yms metallicity is not well constrained , we consider two cases . in the first case",
    "we assign metallicities of [ fe / h]=-1.0 to the four oldest bins , the best - fit value from our sc fits to the oms that is consistent with the spectroscopic metallicities , and metallicities of [ fe / h]=-0.3 to the four youngest bins . in the second case",
    "we assign the same metallicity , [ fe / h]=-0.85 , to all age bins .",
    "the extinction is fixed at an @xmath18 of 1.0 for c1 and 0.7 for c2 and we apply a gaussian distance modulus spread of 0.5 magnitudes .",
    "we use the same control field cmds as for the sc fits to the oms in fields c1 and c2 .",
    "figure [ fig : c1distfits ] shows the results of the distance fits for field c1 , for the case of metal - poor oms and metal - rich yms ( left column ) , and for a uniform metallicity over the whole age range ( right column ) .",
    "the upper panels show the distance solutions as 2-d histograms and the middle and lower panels show the corresponding synthetic hess diagrams and residual significances . in figure",
    "[ fig : c2distfits ] we show the same results for field c2 .",
    "the results are in agreement with those of the previous section . assuming a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.0 for the oldest age bins and [ fe / h]=-0.3 for the youngest , the oms stars are located at the same distance moduli that the sc fits give , and the yms stars are located at distance moduli that are @xmath00.6 magnitudes larger . because of the l.o.s .",
    "extent of both populations , they do partly overlap in space , but their density peaks are clearly not equidistant in the case of differing metallicities .",
    "as already implied by figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] , when assuming a constant metallicity of [ fe / h]=-0.85 over the whole age range , the yms is found to be at the same distance as the yms . comparing the model hess diagrams and residual significance plots in figures [ fig : c1distfits ] and [ fig : c2distfits ]",
    "shows that both scenarios give practically indistinguishable fits .",
    "before discussing the implications of our results for the interpretation of the cma stellar over - density , it is worthwhile to review these results .",
    "we have investigated the stellar populations of the cma over - density in several fields using deep optical photometry and cmd fitting techniques . specifically , we explored the properties of the oms and yms using sc fits in section [ sec : scfits ] .",
    "for the fields near the presumed center of cma the fits indicate a rather low metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0@xmath20.1 dex for the oms .",
    "this agrees well with the spectroscopic measurements from n.f .",
    "martin et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) , [ fe / h]@xmath17 - 0.9 , based on several hundred rc stars within a few degrees from the positions of our central fields .",
    "the distance we measure to the oms is 7.4 , 7.9 , 6.9 , and 7.2 kpc for fields c1 , c2 , o1 , and o2 respectively , which also agrees well with previous estimates @xcite .",
    "we find a @xmath1 of @xmath00.42 magnitudes .",
    "since the photometric errors , age and metallicity spread , and a realistic binary fraction are all accounted for in the models , this directly translates into a physical l.o.s .",
    "depth of @xmath01.5 kpc .",
    "this is consistent with our upper limit for @xmath1 for the oms in b06 .",
    "the exact stellar ages and age distribution within the oms population can not be constrained well because of the heavy contamination by fore- and background stars in the msto region .",
    "but we find that the oms population is predominantly @xmath03 - 6 gyr old , which is typically termed an ` intermediate ' age .",
    "given the amount of contamination in the fields this , however , does not exclude the presence of a less numerous population of , for example , much older stars .",
    "for the yms the ages are better constrained and these stars have a range in age from at least few hundred million years to at most @xmath02 gyr . based on our results",
    "we conclude with high significance that the yms stars can not all be younger than 100 myr , nor older than 2 gyr .",
    "owing to a strong degeneracy between metallicity and distance modulus ( see figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] ) , a secure determination of either of these parameters individually is precluded .",
    "either the yms has a metallicity similar to that of the oms , in which case it would have to be equidistant and therefore co - spatial with the oms , or it is more metal - rich , in which case it is located behind the oms . this same picture is confirmed by our distance solution fits in section [ sec : distfits ] .",
    "how do our findings relate to the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the cma over - density ?",
    "since the possibility exists that the oms and yms populations are not actually related , it should be considered that different explanations are needed for each .",
    "three theories have been suggested in the literature : ( a ) the cma over - density is ( the remnant of ) an dwarf galaxy being accreted onto the mw ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( b ) the warp and flare of the outer disk create the observed over - density along the l.o.s .",
    "@xcite ; ( c ) both oms and yms are related to intrinsic substructure within the outer disk , the oms to a nearby spiral arm and the yms to a distant spiral arm @xcite . below",
    "we discuss each of these options in light of the results of this paper .",
    "if the cma over - density is an accreted dwarf galaxy , it would be expected to have different properties from disk stars , for example in kinematics and metallicity .",
    "proper motion measurements of a sample of yms stars near the presumed center of cma by @xcite are consistent with this scenario @xcite , as are kinematical measurements of the oms by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent metallicity measurements of stars in the outer galactic disk by @xcite show a clear dependence on galactocentric radius ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "our determination of the metallicity of the oms stars of [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0 means that they are significantly more metal - poor than the expectation for disk stars at @xmath2213 kpc , [ fe / h]@xmath23 - 0.5 @xcite , thus hinting at an external origin",
    ". the ages of the oms stars are not well constrained , but the majority of the population has an intermediate age of @xmath03 - 6 gyr .",
    "many dwarf galaxies have such intermediate age populations , but are expected to also contain a population of older ( @xmath010 gyr ) stars ; but as mentioned before our results do not exclude the presence of such stars .",
    "the sc fits are sensitive to the most numerous population and a less numerous population could easily ` hide ' in the noise caused by the large contamination from fore- and background stars .",
    "unfortunately , photometry alone does not constrain the metallicity of the yms stars well enough and therefore we can not say whether or not their metallicity is consistent with them being disk stars .",
    "should they have similar metallicities to the oms stars , it would be hard to reconcile this with them being disk stars .",
    "furthermore , it would place them at the same distance as the oms stars ( e.g. figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] ) , in accordance with the picture of an accreted dwarf galaxy with an extended star formation history . on the other hand",
    ", they might be metal - rich and farther away than the oms , meaning that the two populations are probably not related at all . in this case",
    ", the metallicity and kinematics of the oms would still be consistent with an external origin , but the yms might well originate in the galaxy .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of yms stars will clearly be of key importance to resolve this issue .    in b06",
    "we compare the observed stellar density profile along the l.o.s . towards canis major with predictions from galactic warp / flare models .",
    "this analysis shows that the warp of the outer disk is unlikely to produce as narrow a peak in the stellar density at a distance of @xmath07.5 kpc as is observed .",
    "rather , a more extended density peak is expected , peaking much closer to us .",
    "the distance and @xmath1 determinations in this paper confirm that the l.o.s .",
    "density profile of cma has a narrow peak with @xmath241.5 kpc centered at @xmath07.5 kpc and are thus inconsistent with the warp interpretation of cma . as stated before , the metallicity we find for the oms is significantly lower than expected for disk stars , also arguing against the warp / flare hypothesis .",
    "although the yms stars might be disk stars , their distance ( @xmath09.3 kpc in this case ) is also inconsistent with smooth ( locally axisymmetric ) warp models .",
    "additional substructure would have to be invoked to explain an over - density of young stars at this distance .",
    "large scale substructure in the disk exists in the form of spiral arms , and especially young stellar populations are concentrated in these .",
    "@xcite suggest that the young stars seen in the direction of canis major and in the background of several open clusters are part of the outer norma - cygnus spiral arm . in their picture , the old stars are part of the orion ( local ) arm , which is located in the inter - arm region between the sagittarius and perseus spiral arms , meaning that the old stars are much closer to us .",
    "if the yms is part of a galactic spiral arm it should be expected to be relatively metal - rich .",
    "assuming [ fe / h]=-0.3 , our fits imply a distance to the yms of @xmath09 kpc .",
    "figure [ fig : spirals ] shows a schematic face - on view of the third quadrant of the milky way .",
    "spiral arms according to @xcite , which are based on a combination of different optical and hi spiral arm tracers , are outlined as well as the position of the sun and the l.o.s . towards the cma fields studied in this paper .",
    "the black dot indicates the location of the yms if [ fe / h]=-0.3 ; it coincides with the distance to the outer spiral arm .",
    "our fits therefore confirm that when assuming close - to - solar metallicities one will find that the distance to the yms is the same as the distance to the norma - cygnus spiral arm .",
    "it should be noted that although the yms coincides with the spiral arm in this face - on view , it has a large offset in z , the direction perpendicular to the plane . if this distance is correct , these yms stars are located more than 1 kpc out of the plane of the disk .",
    "all `` classic '' tracers of the spiral arm are less than 0.5 kpc out of the galactic midplane ( @xmath5=0 ) , with the exception of only one detected molecular cloud .",
    "the proper motion measurements by @xcite show that the yms stars are moving even farther away from the plane .",
    "some additional explanation for the extreme location and kinematics of these stars is needed to reconcile them with a galactic origin .",
    "if we assume that the metallicity of the yms is much lower than solar and similar to that of the oms , the best - fit distance of the yms shifts to the same distance as the oms , in which case it is located in an inter - arm region . again , spectroscopic measurement of the metallicity of the yms is crucial to solve this problem .",
    "the location of the oms is indicated in figure [ fig : spirals ] with the dark grey dot ; it lies in the inter - arm region between the perseus and cygnus spiral arms . also drawn in figure [ fig : spirals ]",
    "is the approximate position of the orion arm , as outlined by @xcite in their figure 2 , based on the positions of open star clusters .",
    "clearly , the orion arm crosses the l.o.s . towards our fields at a much smaller distance of approximately 2 kpc , or a distance modulus of m - m=11.5 .",
    "such a distance is far smaller than what previous studies of cma have indicated and excluded at high confidence by our results ( see e.g. table [ tab : scresults ] and figure [ fig : distmetcontours ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity we find for the oms in fields c1 and c2 , [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0 , is much lower than is found for the galactic thin and thick disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "applying cmd - fitting techniques to a small subset of fields from our survey of the cma region ( b06 ) we have determined the distance , l.o.s . extent and metallicity of the old and young stars in the cma over - density . for the `` old '' stars ( oms ) the recovered distance , @xmath07.5 kpc , @xmath1 , @xmath01.5 kpc , metallicity , [ fe / h]@xmath0 - 1.0 , and mean ages , @xmath03 - 6 gyr , are in good agreement with results from the literature . also , we have constrained the metallicity , distance , l.o.s .",
    "extent and ages of the younger population of stars seen in the same direction .",
    "these stars have ages of at least a few hundred million years and at most 2 gyr .",
    "the degeneracy between distance and metallicity prevents us from drawing a firm conclusion about the co - spatiality of the old and young stars .",
    "a metal - rich ( [ fe / h]=@xmath0 - 0.3 ) population at @xmath09.3 kpc and a metal - poor ( [ fe / h]=@xmath0 - 0.8 ) population at 7.5 kpc are both consistent with the data .",
    "spectroscopic metallicities for the young stars are necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities .",
    "a comparison of the distance of the oms with galactic warp / flare models argues against the interpretation that the oms is the result of the warp and flare of the galactic disk ( b06 ) .",
    "our results are inconsistent with the oms stars being located in the local orion arm , since the implied distance of @xmath02 kpc is ruled out with high significance .",
    "the metallicity we find seems too low for disk stars , hinting at an external origin .",
    "because of the degeneracy mentioned above we can not be certain about the nature of the yms . if it is metal - rich , it coincides in distance , but not in height above the disk , with the norma - cygnus spiral arm .",
    "perhaps a scenario where a combination of spiral arm structure and the warp conspire to produce young stars so far out of the disk is feasible . on the other hand ,",
    "if the yms has a similar metallicity to the oms , it is co - spatial with the oms and located in an inter - arm region . in this case",
