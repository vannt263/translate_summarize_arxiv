    "winds of many early - type stars show cyclic , or even strictly periodic , variability on a rotational timescale .",
    "this behaviour was extensively studied in the uv with the iue satellite .",
    "both pulsations and magnetic fields have been suggested as the cause for this variability .",
    "it is clear that kg magnetic fields as observed in the bp stars can explain the observed , strictly periodic , variability . for other early - type stars where",
    "no such fields have been detected and which can have much denser winds , the origin of the variability is still unknown .",
    "recently , magnetic fields have been discovered in several early b type stars , with @xmath0 cep among them .",
    "these stars have weaker fields ( a few hundred gauss  * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and stronger winds than the magnetically strong bp stars , which are mostly of a later spectral type .",
    "using numerical simulations , we investigate the effects of the magnetic field on the stellar wind of @xmath0 cep .",
    "our method consists of two steps .",
    "first we compute the wind geometry in the presence of a magnetic field , using a mhd code that starts out from the relaxed non - magnetic wind solution and a dipole field and is evolved in time until quasi - steady behaviour is observed .",
    "second , from the end state of our simulations we calculate line profiles using a sei ( sobolev with exact integration ) method .",

    "the material is guided by the magnetic field towards the magnetic equator , where it is heated by shocks . due to the higher densities in this `` disk '' ,",
    "the radiation force is reduced and radial velocities are relatively small . in fig.[lineprofiles ] we show the observed civ variability as a function of the rotational phase and calculations for the blue line of the doublet .",
    "both in the observations and the simulations with a fixed abundance , most absorption is seen along the magnetic equatorial plane . for the simulations including the ionisation balance",
    ", the pattern appears to be offset by 0.25 in phase .",
    "this is caused by the high temperature in the disk which reduces the civ abundance .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the auger effect is likely required to account for this offset , since most x - rays will come from the shock heated disk .",
    "recent results @xcite show that magnetic fields measured with the lsd method could be overestimated .",
    "if @xmath0 cep would indeed have a weaker field , this could help to better explain the observed wind terminal speed .",
    "although more work needs to be done , in principle the effect of the magnetic field on the wind of @xmath0  cep can explain the observed uv line - profile variability .",
    "further modelling of other magnetic early b stars and wind lines like nv and siiv , will allow a detailed view on how stellar winds are affected by magnetic fields , and the importance of the auger effect .",
