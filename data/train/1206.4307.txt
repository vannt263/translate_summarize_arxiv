    "the dusty environment around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) came in reach of direct observations using the new high spatial resolution capabilities of long - baseline infrared ( ir ) interferometry . within the last years several observing campaigns revealed emission sources in the nuclear region that shows clear characteristics of agn - heated dust on the sub - parsec to parsec scale in the near- and mid - ir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "were highly resolved with rather low visibilities that have been interpreted as the reemission signatures of the circumnuclear obscuring region , commonly dubbed `` dust torus '' .",
    "this geometrically - thick torus is an essential part of the unification scheme of agn and explains the difference of type 1 and type 2 agn by angle - dependent obscuration .",
    "recently , ir interferometry has shown that the spectral and spatial characteristics of the mid - ir emission sources ( spectral slope and apparent size ) in type 1 agn are tightly correlated with the brightness profile and radial distribution of the dust @xcite .",
    "one problem with these previous observations is that they either miss most of the single - aperture flux , which has been resolved out ( ngc  1068 and circinus ) , or that they do not have the position - angle coverage necessary to constrain the shape / orientation of the nuclear emission source .",
    "this structural information is an important input for torus models that simulate ir images and predict certain position - angle dependent spectral and spatial features @xcite .    in this paper , we present mid - ir interferometry observations of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  424 .",

    "both values are consistent with a heavily obscured agn , and most of the obscuring column is probably intrinsic to the agn , in spite of the considerable inclination of the host galaxy .",

    "this instrument allows for spectro - interferometric observations in the mid - ir waveband from @xmath2 .",

    "it is important to point out that the @xmath21- and @xmath22-band data from the 8 m telescope with a ( seeing - limited ) spatial resolution of about 0@xmath244 are consistent , within error , with the @xmath25 and @xmath26 spitzer data with a spatial resolution of about @xmath27 reported by @xcite .",
    "this can be taken as evidence that the ir emission in the central arcsecond is dominated by emission from the agn without significant enhancement by starformation in the nuclear region .",
    "indeed , the spitzer irs spectrum of the nuclear @xmath28 shown in @xcite displays pah features with only small equivalent widths , the largest being the 7.7@xmath13 feature but no line visible at 11.3@xmath13 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; agn fraction @xmath29 using the authors relation between agn contribution , irac and iras photometry ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : irsed ] we show a broad - band ir sed from about @xmath30 to @xmath31 combining the spitzer data as shown in @xcite with the 8m - telescope data presented in this work . the plot illustrates the ir bump typical of dust emission and seen in all radio - quiet agn .",
    "according to the unification scheme , it is caused by circumnuclear dust in the equatorial region of the agn that re - emits the absorbed `` big blue bump '' ( bbb ) uv / optical radiation ( presumed to originate from the accretion disk ) .",
    "one of the interesting properties of this target is that we see the ir sed rising at short wavelengths , flattening in the @xmath32 region , and then falling off towards 100@xmath13 , despite the comparable large intrinsic apertures involved .",
    "the resolution of the mips data at 70@xmath13 corresponds to @xmath334.6kpc . yet",
    "the sed is more or less a downward continuation of the data at shorter wavelengths and much higher angular resolution ( at least to first order ; see below ) . indeed , the whole sed from the near- to far - ir connects smoothly despite the different instruments and resolutions involved .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that the unresolved ir nucleus dominates all of the ir emission without any significant contribution from other sources , e.g. circumnuclear starforming regions , and that the agn is the only source of energy that produces the ir emission in the nuclear region .",
    "there are two notable exceptions from the smooth connection of all sed data .",
    "the first one is a slight offset of the mips data with respect to the longest wavelengths in the irs data .",
    "this may be an indication that there exists an additional , cool ir component contributing to longer wavelengths .",
    "if this were true , then we would expect that the slope changes from the downward tail of the irs data through the mips data . however , this is not the case .",
    "in fact the data seem to be just offset by a factor of 1.3 , which could be a sign of an issue with flux calibration in the far - ir , but we can not exclude the possibility of slightly extended emission between the smaller and larger apertures .",
    "anyway , the flux is strongly and monotonically decreasing toward the far - ir .",
    "the second discontinuity in the sed is more interesting .",
    "while the isaac @xmath21- and @xmath22-band measurements are well in agreement with the irac data and smoothly connect to the irs short wavelengths , the midi total flux spectrum is significantly lower than the irs data .",
    "the difference of a factor of 1.31.4 is difficult to be attributed to calibration problems , since both the irs and midi calibration seems to be consistent in itself ( for midi see sec .  [ sec : obs : interferometry ] ) . under the assumption that there are no unknown systematic problems with the midi data , we can imagine two possibilities for this discrepancy : first",
    ", there may be extended warm emission outside of the midi aperture of @xmath34 or 130pc .",
    "the dust can not be too hot ( @xmath35800k ) or too cold ( @xmath36200k ) , however , because we do not see a disagreement between small and large apertures in the near - ir and also no bump in the irs spectrum beyond 20@xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the sed in the difference spectrum is flat , so that we can estimate a temperature of the possible extended emission of@xmath37 . when using the @xmath38-relation @xcite to estimate the dust sublimation radius for this type 2 source , we obtain about 0.065pc ( with significant error bars ) .",
    "given the constraints from the midi and spitzer aperture , the emission responsible for the mid - ir flux difference would then be located at a distance @xmath39 .",
    "when assuming a standard ism dust composition , we would expect an equilibrium temperature with the agn radiation of @xmath36100k at that distance , which contradicts the requirements based on the sed shape as just discussed . finally , an additional heating source that provides energy for the dust in a very narrow wavelength range is also difficult to imagine , in particular when required not to leave any other traces .",
    "we repeat that starformation is a very unlikely candidate because of the almost complete lack of pah features ( except a small feature at 7.7@xmath13 ) and the lack of a far - ir bump .",
    "the second possibility is mid - ir variability . in fig .",
    "[ fig : irsed ] we indicated the years in which each of the sets of observations were taken .",
    "interestingly the midi data is separated by about 4 years from the other observations .",
    "we recently discussed how ir variability of a dusty structure compares at different wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the principle of ir variability is simple : if the incident radiation onto the dust ( here : the bbb radiation ) changes , the dust temperature at a given distance from the source changes as well and , consequently , the flux varies .",
    "the main difference between near- and mid - ir wavelengths is the size and distance of the emitting regions .",
    "the near - ir emission is usually confined to a very narrow region close to the sublimation radius .",
    "therefore the light - crossing time of this region for any variability signal is short and the initial signal is not significantly diluted (= comparable amplitudes of initial bbb signal and near - ir signal ) .",
    "the mid - ir emission is more complex .",
    "it is a combination of the rayleigh - jeans tail of hotter dust and the peak in emission from cooler dust .",
    "moreover , the radial distribution of the dust also matters .",
    "overall the mid - ir emission originates from a relatively large range of distances from the agn , so that the variability signal is smeared out and the amplitudes are smaller , unless the initial signal has a very long duration ( e.g. a long - term break or jump in the agn luminosity ; see fig .  2 in * ?",
    "* for an example ) .",
    "therefore , mid - ir variability is a viable possibility if both ( 1 ) the amplitude of variability and ( 2 ) the size of the region where this variability originates from are physically plausible .",
    "@xcite reported near - ir variability in the @xmath40-band : the host - uncorrected @xmath40-band magnitude showed peak - to - valley variation of 0.34 mag over several years . comparing",
    "the uncorrected @xmath40-band magnitude with our nuclear @xmath40-band flux reveals that about 70% of the @xmath40-band flux of @xcite originates from the host .",
    "the corrected @xmath40-band variability is , therefore , a factor of @xmath41 using our nuclear @xmath40-band measurement .",
    "this near - ir amplitude is sufficient to explain a factor of 1.4 variability in the mid - ir .",
    "the second necessary condition related to the size of the mid - ir emission region can be constrained by the elapsed time between the epochs of the mid - ir observations : within the 4 years , the light propagated about 1.2 pc , so that in order to obtain the potential decrease in mid - ir flux by a factor of 1.4 , the bulk of the mid - ir emission must come from within this radius .",
    "we can test this possibility with our interferometric data ( see below ) .",
    "the sed of ngc  424 is relatively blue when compared to other type 2 or even type 1 agn . in fig .",

    "agn sources have often been modeled by means of a gaussian flux distribution resulting in sizes based on the gaussian fwhm or hwhm .",
    "however , it was shown recently that sizes inferred from single - gaussian models can be quite misleading since the underlying brightness distribution barely resembles a gaussian @xcite .",
    "in fact , these sizes can be considered rather a measure of the array resolution than the source size .",
    "this becomes even more of an issue when 2-dimensional sizes are determined from data where the baseline lengths change with position angle  meaning the source shape is depending on the @xmath0-coverage , a typical problem in contemporary ir interferometry owing to the limiting number of telescopes in the arrays .",
    "there are two ways to approximately overcome this problem .",
    "first , one chooses a fixed visibility , infer the baseline lengths / spatial wavelengths for all position angles at this visibility , and calculates a corresponding size .",

    "however , as discussed in the previous section , the overall increase of extinction toward shorter wavelengths in this range is rather small for any kind of dust ( ism , large grains , silicates , graphites ) .",
    "another possibility for a real decrease in visibility is contamination by the 7.7@xmath13 pah feature .",

    "the extended mid - ir emission in polar region in ngc  424 gives rise to the question if it is consistent with the paradigm that emission from the dusty torus dominates the mid - ir emission .",

    "4 ) where the authors show results from decomposition of spitzer seds of type 1 agn into the torus , a dust nlr , and an additional hot dust components . according to the median of all decompositions , the torus contributes @xmath18080% of the flux between 7 and 15@xmath13 and dominates ( @xmath3550% ) in the range from 4 to 25@xmath13 ( the long - wavelength side being limited by wavelength coverage of the data ) .",
    "however , our data suggests that in ngc  424 dust in the polar region dominates the mid - ir emission .",
    "indeed , we do see elongation in polar direction at all observed baseline lengths , i.e. a consistency in elongation toward polar direction at these spatial scales . at the longest baseline lengths , the visibilities have dropped to @xmath330.4 , meaning that _ at least _",
    "60% of the mid - ir single - aperture / total flux show this elongation direction .",
    "thus , it is not too far reaching to interpret this as evidence that @xmath181 of the mid - ir total flux emission originates from the polar region .",
    "interestingly , @xcite report on new mid - ir interferometric observations of the circinus galaxy on short baseline lengths , complementing previous results on longer baselines @xcite .",
    "these new data indicate that the mid - ir emission is extended in outflow direction not only in the single - telescope aperture as mentioned above , but also on the new baselines . only at baseline lengths",
    "longer than @xmath3350 m does the orientation of the mid - ir emission ( described as a 0.4pc `` disk '' ) change direction toward perpendicular to the outflow region and , therefore , in the direction expected for the classical torus .",
    "however , we note that at these baselines the visibilities decreased to @xmath330.15 , meaning that 85% of the single - aperture mid - ir flux originates from the polar region on scales as small as few parsecs .",
    "whether our data for ngc  424 can be considered consistent with the paradigm of mid - ir emission primarily originating from the torus depends on the question if torus models can reproduce the elongation in polar direction in an obscured agn .",
    "it might be possible that self - shielding effects in the mid - plane of the torus cause the torus to _ appear _ elongated in polar direction while the dust is still strongly concentrated to the mid - plane .",
    "an additional factor could be anisotropic illumination from the bbb / accretion disk onto the torus , i.e. radiation escaping preferentially in polar direction .",
    "detailed radiative transfer models that also include visibility studies have been presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smooth and clumpy ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* clumpy ) , the former also invoking anisotropy of the accretion disk . both studies agree that for sets of models that do well represent the ir seds as observed for typical agn , the visibilities should be higher in polar direction ( i.e. smaller size ) than along the mid - plane of the torus in type-2-like edge - on viewing angles , and more circular towards face - on orientations .",
    "strong polar extension is not to be expected .",
    "this also means that although there is self - shielding in the equatorial plane of the torus , the dust mass in typical radiative transfer models is not sufficient to cause strong - enough obscuration that the mid - ir emission is seen elongated in polar direction .",
    "the radiative transfer models use ad - hoc parameterizations of the dust distribution , while hydrodynamical simulations attempt at getting the mass distribution self - consistently from global parameters of the agn and its environment .",
    "@xcite present high - resolution numerical simulations of ism accretion in the inner 32pc of an agn .",
    "although the authors did not perform radiative transfer simulations of the hydrodynamic models , the mass density distribution in the inner parsecs is quite flat ( disk - like ) . at larger radii ( @xmath3510pc ) ,",
    "the disk flares resulting in a scale hight of the order unity , which is also typically used in the previously mentioned radiative transfer models .",
    "therefore , it is not expected that these models result in strong polar - extended mid - ir emission . @xcite",
    "present hydrodynamic simulations of the central 100pc around an agn , assuming that the dust is produced in - situ by a stellar cluster .",
    "the authors show ( log - scale ) mid - ir radiative transfer images and seds of their standard model . indeed",
    ", these models do show elongation in polar direction and might be considered a better match to our observations . as the authors note , the polar elongation is the result of heavy self - absorbing in a dense torus - plane region , so that only the funnels of their mass distribution are illuminated . as a consequence ,",
    "the overall ir emission is dominated by cool dust resulting in very red seds , incompatible with ngc  424 ( note that the sed of the type 2 agn ngc  424 is significantly bluer in the mid - ir than those of type 1 agns ngc  4151 and mark  841 that have been modeled using these simulations ; see fig . 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the observed silicate emission feature in ngc  424 would require a orientation close to face - on in these models , which , in turn , would make the mid - ir emission appear rather circular ( i.e. dominated by the inner disky structure as noted by the authors ) and probably inconsistent with the @xmath182 axis ratio in ngc  424 .",
    "additionally , the observed high hydrogen column density would be difficult to reproduce .",
    "as mentioned above , self - absorption of mid - ir radiation in the plane of the torus might be a possibility for the polar extension of the mid - ir emission .",
    "if the polar - extended mid - ir emission was caused by a high optical depth in the mid - ir ( i.e. the mid - ir emission of the dust in the torus gets reabsorbed ) , then we would have to expect that the `` missing '' mid - ir emission from the plane is re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "consequently we would see either a small bump in the nuclear sed at longer wavelengths ( where the optical depth becomes smaller than unity ) , or , at least , that the nuclear sed appears very red ( as illustrated by the hydrodynamic simulations of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ngc  424 ,",
    "however , neither is seen . on the contrary , longward of the midi - covered @xmath2 range and the 18@xmath13 silicate feature ,",
    "the sed turns down ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : irsed ] ) , meaning that there is probably no significant amount of radiating dust at longer wavelengths outside of what we see with midi .",
    "concluding our analysis from the previous section , it is very unlikely that in ngc  424 the elongation in polar direction is ( directly ) associated with the dusty torus .",
    "it seems much more likely that @xmath460% of the mid - ir emission is generic to the polar region .",
    "when also considering the results by @xcite on circinus , we may argue that the torus becomes energetically insignificant in the mid - ir in these two sources ( and probably ngc  3783 ) .",
    "considering that a few other sources also show extension in polar direction in the mid - ir on larger scales ( and , in contrast , there are no clear cases with dominant disk - like mid - ir emission ) , it is not reaching too far to discuss possible implications for agn in general .",
    "first , we will have to address the nature of the emission in the polar region in ngc  424 . as indicated by our model results shown above ,",
    "the emission is consistent with dust in thermal equilibrium with the agn .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to assume that the mid - ir emission is indeed originating from dust . since we know that @xmath460% of the mid - ir single - aperture emission originates from the polar region , we can use the ir sed in this wavelength region as a further constraint",
    "the irs and midi spectra show weak silicate emission features at 10 and 18@xmath13 , which by its own points toward dust as the origin .",
    "moreover , it indicates that the emitting dusty medium is optically thin to its own thermal radiation ( see similarities and small anisotropy of mid - ir emission of type 1 and type 2 agn * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , if we would look through the polar region onto the agn ( type 1 case ) , the overall column would still be optically thin .",
    "this would be consistent with the unification scheme that requires mostly unobscured views of the central engine along face - on line - of - sights ( at least in a statistical sense ) .",
    "however , if the dust is optically thin in the mid - ir , the weakness of the silicate features would argue for a deficiency of silicate grains with respect to graphite grains in ism dust mixtures , as expected when dust is exposed to the bbb radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "ngc  424 is a type 2 agn and it certainly has an obscuring medium along the line - of - sight to the accretion disk and blr given the observed high x - ray column density in spite of displaying a silicate emission feature ( a mismatch in column density versus optical / ir obscuration is common in agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "this means that it offers support for the validity of the unification scheme in this source .",
    "the unification scheme also requires a geometrically - thick torus  for which we did not find evidence in the mid - ir here .",
    "however , angle - dependent obscuration does not require that the scale height is large at all distances from the agn , although this is what most torus models assume .",
    "it is well possible that the geometrically - thick part that gives rise to the required torus covering factor in the unification scheme is limited to the innermost dusty region . indeed , as mentioned before , type 1 agn show a distinct near - ir `` @xmath183 bump '' in the sed from hot dust , and this component has different emission characteristics than the mid - ir emission @xcite .",
    "the size of this component is consistent with agn - heated , large graphite grains near their sublimation temperature @xcite .",
    "moreover , ir interferometry suggests that this hot - dust component has at least a comparable or even larger surface filling factor as the cool dust ( see fig .",
    "11 of * ? ? ?",
    "one interpretation of this result is a considerable covering factor of the hot dust component ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for an sed - based argument on the covering factor of the hot component ) .",
    "we may , therefore , speculate that the classical , obscuring torus is , in fact , related to the hot - dust emitting dust component rather than the mid - ir emitting component .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dis : sketch ] we show a sketch of the dust distribution around ngc  424 as this scenario would suggest .",
    "the torus flares strongly in the innermost part , but becomes geometrically thin in the outer regions . in this picture",
    ", the near - ir emission originates from the obscuring part of the torus while the mid - ir emission comes primarily from the polar region .",
    "the ir - emitting sources in the polar regions have been drawn as clouds , but they could also be filamentary .",
    "this inhomogeneous structure of the dust is motivated by the mid - ir interferometry of circinus @xcite , but also mid - ir imaging of ngc  1068 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , in circinus ( but not necessarily in ngc  1068 ) , the extended mid - ir emission in the single - telescope images seems to be associated with the edge of the outflow region @xcite .",
    "we also see an offset of 20@xmath6 between mid - ir position angle and the polarization angle in ngc  424 .",
    "this could be a sign of an edge - brightening effect as expected in a cone - like region filled with optically - thin dust .",
    "therefore , we placed the polar - region clouds preferentially around the edges of the opening cone in the sketch .",
    "note that this is not a full picture of the distribution of the dust but only a sketch for the ir - emitting material and the polar region may well be filled more homogeneously with dust clouds .",
    "this picture also has several implication related to the physical mechanisms around the agn .",
    "the new observations presented here can be interpreted as strong support for a dusty wind ( as used in models for the x - ray emission of some agn ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this wind could be driven by radiation pressure on dust grains in the agn environment .",
    "for an agn in the seyfert regime radiating at about a tenth of its eddington luminosity @xmath184 ( defined by electron scattering ) , radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind dust from the gravitational potential ( the corresponding dust eddington luminosity is @xmath185 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mid - ir spectra also hint toward the source of the dust that is driven outward in polar direction : as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : para ] the dust seems to be deficient of silicate grains .",
    "silicates have a lower sublimation temperature than graphite grains @xcite , making them disappear from a dusty medium at generally larger distances from the heating source than graphite grains ( for a given grain size ) .",
    "this is consistent with the near - ir interferometry and reverberation mapping sizes in agn that favor large graphite grains for the hottest dust at the sublimation temperature @xcite , and similar requirements from optical extinction curves in type 1 agn @xcite .",
    "this inner region is also the one closest to the agn where the dust is directly exposed ( i.e. without significant self - obscuration ) to the strongest radiation field .",
    "it is , therefore , plausible to expect that the dust is driven away from this inner part of the torus .",
    "this scenario seems qualitatively in agreement with recent radiation feedback simulations in hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently presented ir seds of wind models that could eventually serve as a starting point for a more quantitative test of dusty winds .",
    "radiatively - driven winds or radiation pressure in both the optical and ir have also been suggested as a mechanism to support the apparent geometrical thickness of the torus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of course , this mechanism works best in the inner part of the torus close to the sublimation radius because of self - shielding effects further out @xcite . as a consequence the geometrical thickness",
    "would be limited to just the inner few sublimation radii distances from the agn where , incidentally , the dust is hot enough to cause the near - ir bump seen in type 1 agn .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , an analogous near - ir bump in the dusty disks of young stellar objects ( ysos ) has been described as a `` puffed - up inner rim '' @xcite . in this scenario",
    "we would see the near - ir bump pronounced or weak / absorbed depending on our line - of - sight to the hotter or cooler side of this compact structure . unlike in agn , however , a dusty outflow associated with the puffed - up rim has not been observed .",
    "this difference is not unexpected given the much softer radiation field of a star compared to an agn and the associated lower strength of uv / optical radiation pressure to launch such a wind .",
    "the question remains if objects like ngc  424 and circinus ( and possibly ngc  1068 ) are a special class of objects or if the dusty polar regions are more generic to the agn population . as discussed above , there are signs of polar extensions in the mid - ir on scales of 10s of parsecs in other seyfert galaxies as well , but we do not have the interferometry data to test if this polar component is energetically dominant in these sources .",
    "if it is generic , then it will require adjustments to current models of the dust emission of agn .",
    "we present vlti / midi mid - ir interferometric observations of the x - ray - obscured type 2 nucleus of ngc  424 . the @xmath0-coverage allowed us to constrain the position angle - dependent sizes of the mid - ir emission source in the @xmath2 wavelength range .",
    "we used two different methods to overcome size biases by the inhomogeneous distribution of projected baseline lengths on the @xmath0-plane ( i.e. beam shape effects ) .",
    "as complementary information , a high spatial resolution ir sed has been compiled .",
    "in addition to simple geometric fits , we also modeled photometric and interferometric data simultaneously by a simple model that assumes dust emission in thermal equilibrium with the agn .",
    "this led to the following main results :    * the mid - ir emission source in ngc  424 is resolved and elongated .",
    "its size depends on position - angle , wavelength , and baseline . for a baseline length of 58 m",
    "we find a size of @xmath186 at 9.1@xmath13 , and @xmath187 at 12.5@xmath13 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : res : wlsize ] , the source size shows a systematic increase with wavelength .",
    "a more baseline - independent size can be extracted using the half - light radius @xmath102 as defined in @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath188 for the @xmath164 wavelength - averaged visibilities of ngc  424 . * the major axis of the mid - ir emission in ngc  424 points toward pa @xmath189 based on the best - fit model of the complete data set .",
    "this direction is consistent with the pa derived from simple geometric fits to individual wavelength data corrected for the @xmath0-coverage bias ( or beam shape ) .",
    "we also detect a flatter radial brightness distribution in the direction of the major axis than along the minor axis of the mid - ir emission .",
    "interestingly , the position angle of the major axis is only 20@xmath6 off the system axis as set by spectro - polarimetry .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the mid - ir emission is extended in polar direction or symmetry axis of the torus .",
    "* the polar - elongated emission is responsible for @xmath460% of the mid - ir total flux ( i.e. single telescope flux ) in ngc  424 on scales from about 1pc to @xmath33100pc .",
    "these results can be put into the broader context of agn unification and our current picture of the mid - ir emission from the dusty torus .",
    "we conclude :    * the elongation of the nuclear mid - ir source on parsec scales in polar direction seems inconsistent with typical state - of - the - art radiative transfer models of the torus , either smooth or clumpy . while the hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite do show polar - elongated mid - ir emission , the model seds are incompatible with the observed ir sed of ngc  424 .",
    "we conclude that it is very difficult to simultaneously explain both the shape and sed of ngc  424 within the framework of current torus models . *",
    "based on the spectral ( sed ) and spatial ( interferometry ) information , the source of the emission is most likely optically thin dust in the polar region of the agn . while the total dust column and surface brightness are , therefore , low , the emission covers a relatively large area leading to the high contribution of flux to the overall mid - ir emission .",
    "we note that similar mid - ir extensions in polar region have been observed on scales of several 10s of parsecs in a few other sources , including ngc  1068 . *",
    "the characteristics of the mid - ir emission in ngc  424 show similarities to the nucleus of the circinus galaxy ( and probably ngc  1068 as well ) where about @xmath3385% of the mid - ir flux originates in the polar region and coincides with the western edge of the outflow cone .",
    ", i.e. several degrees off from the nominal system axis . in ngc  424 ,",
    "the mid - ir major axis is off about 20@xmath6 from the polar axis .",
    "this could be interpreted as an edge brightening effect in a cone filled with optically thin dust . *",
    "our data suggests that the origin of the dust in the polar region may be a radiatively - driven wind from the inner part of the torus .",
    "the dust in the inner torus region is expected to be deficient of silicate grains , which is well matched by the mid - ir spectral features of the polar dust .",
    "based on recent near- and mid - ir interferometry results of a sample of type 1 agn , we propose that the torus has a small scale height at large distances from the agn and is puffed - up by radiation pressure in the inner region , leading to the required covering factors in the unification scheme . in this picture , the near - ir emission ( up to about @xmath5 would be dominated by the torus , while the dusty outflow would be the main contributor to the mid - ir .",
    "our results for ngc  424 have significant implications for models of the ir emission of agn . owing to a lack of suitable data , we do not know if the mid - ir emission sources in ngc  424 and a few other nearby seyfert galaxies are special cases or more generic to agn , but it seems as more cases of polar - extended mid - ir emission are revealed when objects are studied in detail by high - angular resolution techniques . moreover , the results of @xcite and @xcite suggest that the structure of the dusty environment depends on luminosity .",
    "it is , therefore , important to follow - up our results with interferometry from near- to mid - ir wavelengths and a good position - angle and baseline coverage of more sources .",
    "the upcoming vlti / matisse instrument , operating from 3.5 to 13@xmath13 , should be able to test if the near - ir emission is , indeed , dominated by the torus while the mid - ir flux originates in the outflow .",

    "<S> advancements in infrared ( ir ) interferometry open up the possibility to spatially resolve active galactic nuclei ( agn ) on the parsec - scale level and study the circumnuclear dust distribution , commonly referred to as the `` dust torus '' , that is held responsible for the type 1/type 2 dichotomy of agn . </S>",
    "<S> we used the mid - ir beam combiner midi together with the 8 m telescopes at the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) to observe the nucleus of the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc  424 , achieving an almost complete coverage of the @xmath0-plane accessible by the available telescope configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we detect extended mid - ir emission with a relatively baseline- and model - independent mid - ir half - light radius of @xmath1 ( averaged over the @xmath2 wavelength range ) . </S>",
    "<S> the extended mid - ir source shows an increasing size with wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> these properties are in agreement with the idea of dust heated in thermal equilibrium with the agn . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the major axis in position angle @xmath3 is closely aligned with the system axis as set by optical polarization observations . </S>",
    "<S> torus models typically favor extension along the mid - plane at mid - ir wavelengths instead . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the majority of the pc - scale mid - ir emission ( @xmath460% ) in this type 2 agn originates from optically - thin dust in the polar region of the agn , a scenario consistent with the near- to far - ir sed . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that a radiatively - driven dusty wind , possibly launched in a puffed - up region of the inner hot part of the torus , is responsible for the polar dust . in this picture , the torus dominates the near - ir emission up to about @xmath5 , while the polar dust is the main contributor to the mid - ir flux . </S>",
    "<S> our results of ngc  424 are consistent with recent observations of the agn in the circinus galaxy and resemble large - scale characteristics of other objects . if our results reflect a general property of the agn population , the current paradigm for interpreting and modeling the ir emission of agn have to be revised . </S>"
