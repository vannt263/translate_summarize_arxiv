    "a binary representation is a natural approximation for systems whose elements tend to take distinct high and low values with sharp transitions between states .",

    "magnasco has shown that it is possible to construct continuous systems that implement any specified boolean computation @xcite .",
    "the present work addresses new dynamical features that arise in large networks of generic elements with sigmoidal response functions and explores the extent to which they can be understood using boolean models .",
    "we consider an illustrative class of continuous models and show that information propagation along chains plays a key role in determining the qualitative dynamical behavior of large random networks .",
    "we develop a modified boolean theory incorporating the effects of signal decay on certain chains that explains key features of the continuous dynamics .",
    "applying the theory to the well - known transition between order and disorder in random networks @xcite reveals that signal decay has little effect on ordered dyanmics but can lead to a substantial suppression of disorder . finally , we study cis - regulatory functions from the quantitative biology literature and show that our theory accounts well for the dynamics of random networks constructed using those functions . the differences in collective behavior of the continuous systems and naive boolean models are not simple extensions of the differences in attractor structure noted in earlier studies @xcite .",

    "first , the interactions between elements in the systems of interest typically involve a series of events that take time to complete . for transcriptional networks , the activation or repression of a target gene due to the buildup of a particular mrna requires the translation of the mrna , the folding of the protein , and the transport of the protein to the nucleus .",
    "in this case , the delays in our model equations represent the time required for protein levels to build up , along with whatever other post - translational processes are required and may be thought of as capturing the dominant effect of a set of explicit equations for additional variables .",
    "second , the delays are necessary to produce simple oscillatory behavior in small negative feedback loops .",
    "a self - repressor in a boolean system produces oscillations rather than fixed points , but a continuous self - repressor will not oscillate in the absence of a time delay . to get a meaningful comparison of large boolean network models and the underlying continuous systems , we want to study continuous models capable of exhibiting the oscillatory behaviors of very simple negative feedback loops . though there may be cases in which the function of negative feedback in a real system is just to regulate the level of a fixed point",
    ", such feedback would be irrelevant from the perspective of boolean modeling .    a system that nicely illustrates the role of time delays is the repressilator ( a loop of three repressors ) studied by elowitz and leibler @xcite .",
    "to model the observed oscillations , it was necessary to include separate equations for the net rate of production of rna and proteins . coupled equations for rna concentrations of the form of eq .",
    "[ eqn : transferfuncs ] with @xmath13 yield only a stable fixed point @xcite . with sufficiently large time delays",
    ", however , the fixed point becomes unstable to an oscillatory attractor ; it is not necessary to include explicit equations for protein production .",

    "it is not clear , however , whether these features lead to important effects in large systems .",
    "the close match for @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath14 and its boolean model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meanvar ] ) suggests that they do not , but care must be taken to interpret these results .",
    "much of the agreement can be attributed to the fact that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined primarily by the fraction of frozen nodes in the network , a quantity that does not depend on the timing or sequence of updating the nodes @xcite .    in the ordered regime ,",
    "the nearly vanishing number of nodes that are _ not _ frozen leads to very low values of @xmath38 .",
    "the agreement in the disordered regime is less trivial .",
    "consider , for example , a ring of nodes containing a random mixture of copiers and inverters .",
    "for synchronously updated boolean dynamics , every attractor of a given network has a partner in which the values 0 and 1 are exchanged for all time steps , and these two attractors have basins of the same size .",
    "( when the number of inverters is odd , every attractor is its own partner . )",
    "thus @xmath48 is always @xmath49 and @xmath36 is always the maximum value of @xmath50 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the breaking of on - off symmetry in generic continuous systems leads to a collapse of almost all attractors , leaving only two fixed point states for rings with an even number of inverters and one oscillating state for rings with an odd number of inverters .",
    "the odd case produces @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "these are not strict equalities because , unlike for the synchronous boolean ring , a node in the corresponding continuous system need not spend precisely the same time in the high and low states , but the symmetry breaking effect is typically small . @xcite . in the even case ,",
    "on the other hand , the two fixed point states can have dramatically different size basins and therefore exhibit a substantially reduced value of @xmath36 .",
    "for a ring of size @xmath53 with a random mixture of continuous copiers and inverters , we find @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "so in the case of simple rings , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are determined by dynamical properties of the attractors rather than numbers of frozen nodes , we do not see agreement similar to that of @xmath14 and the boolean system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanvar ] .",
    "it appears that the complex network of connections between active rings in the disordered regime restores the agreement .",
    "[ fig : series ] suggests that boolean and continuous attractors in the disordered regime have similar temporal features , but a full characterization of the dynamics of individual attractors is beyond our present scope .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of @xmath15 , a case where the continuous dynamics show substantial deviations from the naive boolean expectations . to understand why @xmath14 and @xmath15 behave differently",
    ", we examine the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 when the second input is held at a low value @xmath56 , the low stable fixed point of @xmath57 . a boolean nif function",
    "whose second input is held at 0 acts as a copier on its first input , so we expect the functions @xmath58 and @xmath59 to behave like copiers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nifcopy ] , @xmath58 has two stable fixed points , but @xmath59 has only one stable fixed point .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the faithful propagation of information along chains of nodes requires two stable fixed points in the transfer function .",
    "we refer to the loss of information along chains of nodes lacking a second stable fixed point as `` propagation failure . '' because @xmath23 does not have the required fixed point structure , propagation failure may cause the system @xmath15 to behave differently from its naive boolean idealization .",
    "we now present a modified boolean model that accounts for propagation failure and agrees well with simulations , as shown by the dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanvar ] .",
    "the success of this theory indicates that for large random networks , propagation failure is the primary source of the measured discrepancy between the continuous system and the original boolean model .",

    "because @xmath23 lacks the necessary high fixed point , propagation failure prevents nodes far down the chain from ever rising above threshold in response to a high input signal to the first node in the chain ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "though they may be initialized at a high value , they will always stay low after a brief transient .",

    "the switch from @xmath78 to @xmath80 associated with the function @xmath59 of fig .  [ fig : nifcopy ] and our chosen threshold of 10 occurs when the initial input to a chain is about 58 .",
    "simulations reveal that the average value of nodes above threshold crosses 58 at @xmath82 , which corresponds reasonably well with the crossover observable in fig .  [",
    "fig : meanvar ] .    the suppression of disorder , as indicated by small values of @xmath38 for @xmath83 in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanvar](b ) , is caused by the effective insensitivity of nodes at the end of sufficiently long chains .",
    "because nodes in this set have approximately fixed values , all nodes receiving both inputs from this set will also have approximately fixed values , leading to a cascade of effectively frozen nodes .",
    "the net result is a substantial loss of sensitivity for the network as a whole .",
    "further insight into the order  disorder transition comes from examining the trajectory traced in the @xmath84 plane as @xmath18 increases from 0 to 1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qrplane ] .",
    "the shaded sector is the disordered regime of the boolean system , where the slope of the derrida plot exceeds unity @xcite .",

    "this plot again reveals a shift from @xmath78 to @xmath80 , but also shows that the system skirts a critical boundary as @xmath18 is varied .",
    "the dynamical suppression of disorder in this case provides a mechanism for keeping a network in the critical regime over a wide range of parameter values .",

    "if we take the transfer functions to be proportional to the probability functions , we find that they lack the necessary fixed points for propagating information and that random networks built from them exhibit strong suppression of disorder .",

    "our results show that faithful propagation down long chains is not crucial for implementing the boolean dynamics arising in the ordered and critical regimes in systems of a few thousand elements .",
    "moreover , if operation near criticality is advantageous for a biological system , as suggested in @xcite , suppression of disorder may be beneficial .",
    "we have identified a dynamical mechanism for accomplishing this , which may be a useful alternative to alteration of the network architecture .",
    "a limited range of propagation could actually be an important feature of real biological networks .",
    "in conclusion , we have seen that the detailed form of continuous transfer functions can have a qualitative effect on the dynamics of large random networks .",
    "if all of the transfer functions have suitable fixed point structures such that signals can propagate down chains of arbitrary length , fundamental statistics of the attractors are similar .",
    "this indicates that disordered systems are not prone to the type of attractor collapse that occurs on simple rings .",
    "when some of the transfer functions do not have a suitable fixed point structure , the dynamics in the disordered regime are strongly affected . in the case studied above , the suppression of disorder leads to an extended domain in the parameter space where the system is close to a critical boolean network .",
    "a successful theory of these effects has been obtained within a boolean framework by accounting for the failure of information to propagate down long chains of nodes .",
    "further characterization of the temporal structure of individual attractors in the disordered regime is needed to fully understand the importance of these phenomena in large networks .",
