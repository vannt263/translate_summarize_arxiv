    "beyond the classical level , quantum fluctuations break chiral symmetry by a term proportional to the gauge coupling and to the number of colours : @xmath53 the dependence on @xmath4 is absent in qcd , and it is typical of gauge models with fermions in the adjoint representation .    the anomalous contribution to the axial transformations can be absorbed in the periodicity of the parameter @xmath15 : @xmath54 if the angle @xmath55 assumes one of the values @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",

    "therefore , at these low temperatures the transition , close to the supersymmetric limit , becomes consistent with a first order chiral phase transition .",
    "moreover , this suggests that the transition happens in the region between @xmath194 and @xmath193 .",
    "it is another indication that the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement transition are close to each other : assuming that the value of @xmath74 does not change so much going from @xmath179 to @xmath195 we are able to estimate an upper limit for the supersymmetric chiral critical temperature : @xmath196 .",
    "we have checked our assumption of a positive pfaffian by a measurement of its sign on 200 configurations . at @xmath179",

    "the transition happens at a temperature , which is around 80% of the transition temperature in pure yang - mills theory .",
    "the identification of the chiral phase transition point , on the other hand , needs more effort , since the transition becomes a crossover at finite gluino masses . in a fixed scale approach",
    "we have identified the transition region taking also the renormalisation into account .",
    "we were able to narrow the range for the chiral transition down to a region close to the deconfinement transition .",
    "this situation can be compared with @xmath199 adjoint qcd ( aqcd ) , a theory similar to sym . in the case of aqcd",
    ", there exists a mixed phase with deconfinement but a broken chiral symmetry .",
    "the deconfinement temperature is eight times smaller than the point of chiral symmetry restoration @xcite . from this perspective",
    ", sym appears to be more similar to qcd , where the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration seem to occur at the same temperature .    in order to confirm scenario ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ scenarios ] with coincident phase transitions , it will be necessary to perform simulations in more parameter points , with higher statistics , and on larger lattices .",

    "presently we have been able to study the phase transitions only at rather low values of @xmath72 , i.  e.  at relatively large lattice spacings . at these parameters",
    "there is still a considerable deviation from the degeneracy of the particle masses in supermultiplets .",
    "hence studies at larger values of @xmath75 are needed for reliable extrapolations to the supersymmetric limit .",
    "this is the largest source of a systematic uncertainty for our current determination of the deconfinement transition point .    in the future",
