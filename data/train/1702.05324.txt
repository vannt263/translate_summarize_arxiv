    "core - collapse supernova explosions occur at the end of the evolution of massive stars heavier than 8 @xmath0 . at the final stage of these stars ,",
    "the stellar central core is composed of highly - degenerate electrons and heavy nuclides such as irons .",
    "owing to photodisintegration of heavy nuclei and electron capture reactions , the core becomes gravitationally unstable , and begins to collapse . during the collapse , neutrinos created through the weak interaction",
    "are trapped in the core because they are scattered by other particles , mainly heavy nuclei .",
    "when the central density of the core approaches the nuclear saturation density , the core becomes stiffer and the resulting core bounce produces an outgoing shock wave .",
    "the shock wave stalls once as a result of the energy loss caused by the photodisintegration of in - falling heavy nuclei and neutrino emissions . according to the neutrino - heating mechanism , a convincing scenario for core - collapse supernovae  @xcite",
    ", the stalled shock then revives as neutrinos emitted from inside the core react with matter through the weak interaction and deposit energies to matter behind the shock .",
    "the above - described scenario of the core - collapse supernovae relies on two characteristics of nuclear matter : the stiffness of high - density nuclear matter , which causes a bounce of the core , and the species of nuclides in hot matter with which the neutrinos react .",
    "these two characters are given in the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "in particular , because the stiffness of nuclear matter is governed by the repulsion of nuclear forces , it should be described with a nuclear hamiltonian composed of realistic nuclear potentials . however , in the supernova eoss proposed so far , the relation between bare nuclear forces and stiffness of nuclear matter is unclear as those eoss are based on phenomenological nuclear models .",
    "the lattimer - swesty eos  @xcite , which is one of the standard supernova eoss , is constructed with an effective skyrme interaction , while the shen eos  @xcite , which is another standard supernova eos , is constructed based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory with the parameter set tm1  @xcite .",
    "the shen eos was extended so as to take into account hyperon mixing  @xcite and quark - hadron phase transition  @xcite . while the symmetry energy of the shen eos ( 36.9 mev ) is rather larger than the empirical value  @xcite , supernova eoss based on rmf theories other than tm1",
    "have also been proposed  @xcite . however , there is no supernova eos based on bare nuclear forces yet .",
    "the current status of supernova eos studies motivated us to construct a new supernova eos based on the variational many - body theory with realistic nuclear forces . in this research project , we employ the argonne v18 ( av18 ) two - body nuclear potential  @xcite , which reproduces the experimental two - nucleon scattering data and deuteron properties , and the urbana ix ( uix ) potential  @xcite for the three - body nuclear force .",
    "we then calculate the free energy per nucleon of uniform nuclear matter with the cluster variational method using the jastrow wave function . here",
    "we note that the thermodynamic quantities of asymmetric nuclear matter with arbitrary proton fractions are necessary to complete a supernova eos table , while it is difficult to perform sophisticated variational calculations such as the fermi hypernetted chain ( fhnc ) calculations for asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "therefore , we employ a simplified two - body cluster approximation and impose appropriate constraints on variational functions so that the obtained energies of symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are in good agreement with those based on the fhnc calculations .",
    "the eos of uniform nuclear matter calculated in this manner is reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we note that mass - radius relation of neutron stars calculated with the obtained eos is consistent with the observational data analyzed by steiner et al .",
    "@xcite .    as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , we previously applied the eos of uniform nuclear matter in refs .",
    "@xcite to numerical simulations of core - collapse supernovae . in that paper",
    ", we adopted the shen eos for non - uniform nuclear matter and connected it to our uniform nuclear eos .",
    "we then performed fully general relativistic , spherically symmetric core - collapse simulations with and without neutrino transfer . in the case without neutrino transfer , the star exploded because the energy loss due to the neutrino emission was switched off . in contrast , with neutrino transfer the shock wave stalled and the stellar explosion failed .",
    "these results are consistent with other realistic core collapse simulations with other eoss , which suggests that spherically symmetric core collapse supernova explosions are unlikely  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the central density of our stellar core following the bounce is higher than in the case of the shen eos because our eos is softer , i.e. , the present eos is advantageous for supernova explosions  @xcite .    needless to say",
    ", the eos of the non - uniform phase should be consistent with that of the uniform phase , i.e. , it is necessary to construct an eos of non - uniform matter in a self - consistent manner , which is the aim of this paper . in our project to construct a new supernova eos , we employ the prescription for the calculation of non - uniform nuclear eos used by shen et al . , i.e. , we calculate nuclides in a wigner - seitz cell in the thomas - fermi approximation .",
    "though several other thomas - fermi calculations for hot nuclear matter have also been adopted especially for the study of the pasta phase @xcite , we employ the thomas - fermi calculation originally adopted by shen et al . as one of the standard thomas - fermi calculations for supernova eos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we review the eos of uniform nuclear matter adopted in this paper .",

    ", we perform the thomas - fermi calculation in order to obtain the thermodynamic quantities of non - uniform nuclear matter following the procedure used by shen et al . in section 4 ,",
    "the obtained thermodynamic quantities of our eos are compared with those in the shen eos .",

    "the isoscalar part ( the charge - independent part ) of the av18 potential is adopted as the two - body nuclear potential @xmath6 .",
    "the three - body part of the hamiltonian @xmath3 is constructed with the uix three - body nuclear potential .    at zero temperature",

    "these correlation functions depend on the two - nucleon total spin @xmath20 , the total isospin @xmath21 and its third component expressed with @xmath22 .",

    "( [ jwf ] ) , the expectation value of the two - body hamiltonian per nucleon @xmath26 is calculated in the two - body cluster approximation . since the energy contribution from the omitted higher - order cluster terms is not negligible , we also impose the following two constraints on the correlation functions @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in order to compensate for the omission of those terms  @xcite .",
    "the first one is the extended mayer s condition which is expressed as follows : @xmath27d\\mbox{\\boldmath$r$}=0 ,    \\label{eq : mayer}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the nucleon number density given as the sum of the neutron number density @xmath29 and the proton number density @xmath30 .",

    "the second constraint is the healing distance condition .",
    "we introduce the healing distance @xmath33 and impose @xmath34 , @xmath35 for @xmath36 ; the correlation between two nucleons vanishes when the distance between them @xmath37 is larger than @xmath33 .",
    "the healing distance @xmath33 is assumed to be independent of ( @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath22 ) , and proportional to @xmath38 which is the radius of a sphere whose volume is @xmath39 ; i.e. , @xmath40 . here",
    ", the coefficient is chosen to be @xmath41 so that the calculated two - body energies per nucleon @xmath42 of pure neutron matter ( @xmath43 ) and symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath44 ) reproduce the results obtained by akmal , pandharipande , and ravenhall ( apr )  @xcite with the fhnc calculation .",
    "in addition to the two - body hamiltonian , we consider the energy per nucleon caused by the three - body nuclear force @xmath45 .",
    "since the uix three - body nuclear potential consists of a phenomenological repulsive component and a two - pion exchange component , the corresponding three - body hamiltonian @xmath3 is divided into the repulsive part @xmath46 and the two - pion exchange part @xmath47 . for these parts of the hamiltonian",
