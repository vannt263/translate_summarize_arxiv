    "light propagating in an optically thick sample is subject to multiple scattering .",
    "although part of the propagation can be described by a diffusion equation neglecting interferences , wave effects can alter the distribution of scattered light .",
    "in particular , disorder in the sample may lead to an enhanced scattering into the backward direction .",
    "the effect is known as coherent backscattering ( cbs ) in mesoscopic physics , and has been studied extensively with classical scatterers  @xcite . the advent of laser - cooling techniques allowed to manipulate and control atomic gases , thus enabling their use as resonant and quantum scatterers .",
    "this triggered the study of coherent multiple scattering in a regime where the quantum internal structure , the wave - particle duality , and quantum statistical aspects play a role @xcite .",
    "cbs is understood as resulting from the constructive interference between a scattering path involving two or more scatterers and the reciprocal ( time - reversed ) path ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , and paths ( i ) and ( ii ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatscheme ] ) .",
    "the interference of reciprocal paths is actually robust when summed up over a large disordered sample , which was one of the surprising features in the first observation of cbs in the eighties  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , some paths add up incoherently and result in a background radiation , whereas reciprocal paths lead to an enhanced intensity in the backward direction",
    ". however , the quantum nature of the atoms leads to deviations in the behavior of cbs as compared to classical scatterers .",
    "for example , the presence of a zeeman structure can break the symmetry between the two reverse paths and reduces the contrast between the enhanced peak of radiation and the background  @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal symmetry of the reciprocal multiple scattering paths is also broken in the strong driving regime , as a which - path information becomes available through the inelastically scattered photons  @xcite .",
    "such saturation - induced loss of coherence in cbs was reported with a cold strontium gas  @xcite and a cold rubidium gas  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical treatment of saturation in multiple scattering is very challenging  @xcite and has not been solved in full generality .    interestingly in a different geometrical configuration coherence effects on the backscattered light",
    "can also be observed in optically thin samples , where multiple scattering is too weak to produce observable signatures .",
    "indeed the introduction of a reflective interface  a dielectric mirror for example  allows for the radiation of the image scatterer to interfere constructively with that of the original scatterer , eventually resulting in a coherent backscattering process  @xcite .",
    "this single scattering regime here involves four processes for each atom [ depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatscheme ] ] , accounting for the real atom and its mirror image , as well as the laser and its image .",
    "let us call @xmath0 the incident wavevector , @xmath1 the scattered wavevector and @xmath2 the normal to the mirror .",
    "for a single atom , all four processes sum up coherently , and the resulting scattered light pattern presents full interference contrast . when the radiation of all atoms is disorder - averaged , though , all interference fringes disappear , except at wavevectors @xmath1 such that @xmath3 , because at these specific directions processes ( i ) and ( ii ) have the same optical path for all atoms in the cloud .",
    "the resulting interference fringes present a circular symmetry around the mirror s normal direction , with a number of maxima depending on the spatial extension of the atomic cloud .",
    "this effect , that will henceforth be referred to as mirror - assisted coherent backscattering ( m - cbs ) , has been observed for classical scattering media  @xcite .        in this work",
    ", we report on the experimental observation of m - cbs from a laser - cooled gas of strontium atoms in the presence of a dielectric mirror . a series of circular fringes predicted by the theory are experimentally observed and quantitatively analyzed . the period and envelope of the interference fringes allow , respectively , to precisely determine the position and longitudinal size of the atomic cloud .",
    "we show that in the strong field regime , where the atoms are fully saturated , the comparison between theory and experimental results allows to show that , in contrast to cbs , inelastic photons fully contribute to m - cbs .",

    "the atoms behave as classical linear scatterers and the total fluorescence is a linear combination of four processes depicted in fig .",

    "the reciprocity of processes ( i ) and ( ii ) requires to add up the corresponding field amplitudes for each atom , whereas the paths ( iii ) and ( iv ) have no reciprocal counterpart , and so the corresponding scattering intensities contribute , after disorder - averaging , to an incoherent background . in this low saturation limit ( @xmath44 ) , the intensity radiated by a gaussian cloud of atoms and its mirror image reads ( see appendix  [ theory ] )    @xmath45,\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the distance between the virtual mirror and the center of the atomic cloud and @xmath47 is the longitudinal cloud radius at @xmath22 . to obtain eq .  , a small angle approximation has been applied ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",

    "the ( virtual ) mirror position @xmath46 was varied for about @xmath56 cm around the center of the cloud , and for each position an interference pattern similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : expscheme ] was extracted .",

    "the error bars associated with the experimental data are smaller than the symbol size.,width=7 ]",
    "in the saturated regime , the atomic dipole moment has a nonlinear response to the applied radiation field .",
    "it is then no longer possible to add up linearly the amplitudes of four independent processes . in order to better understand how the contrast of m - cbs depends on the saturation parameter , we turn to an alternative picture , valid for all saturation , including the low and large saturation limits . in this new picture , we first consider the total fluorescence of a single atom and its mirror image . this fluorescence is a coherent superposition of the light scattered by the atom and its mirror image , which have same amplitude and are strongly correlated .",
    "this leads , for a single atom , to an undamped far field fringe pattern with full contrast .",
    "furthermore , different atoms located at different distances from the virtual mirror are exposed to different local amplitudes of the standing wave created by the superposition of the incoming and reflected m - cbs beams ( see eq .",
    "[ standingwave ] of appendix  [ theory ] ) . for a mirror of perfect reflectivity , and",
    "neglecting the attenuation of the m - cbs beam after its passage through the atomic cloud , both the incoming and reflected m - cbs beams have equal intensity , and the standing wave created has perfect nodes and antinodes .",
    "the absolute amplitude of the far field fluorescence fringes of a single atom is thus a function of the local light intensity at its position , which presents the non - homogeneous distribution of the standing wave .",
    "atoms at the maxima of the standing wave will thus have their far field fluorescence pattern with maximum amplitude ( see blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] ) , compared to other atoms within the atomic cloud ( e.g. yellow or green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] ) . within the previous description based on four different processes , valid at low @xmath63 , these atoms at the maxima of the standing wave are those that have all four processes summed up constructively , with a maximum of the scattered intensity at @xmath64 . on the other hand , for different atomic positions in the standing wave , while the reciprocal processes ( i ) and ( ii ) have always constructive interference at @xmath64 , the angular position of the maximum of the fluorescence for processes ( iii ) and ( iv ) varies and do not always cooperate to produce a maximum intensity at @xmath64 .",
    "hence , adding up coherently all four amplitudes for a single atom creates angular fringes which are a function of the atomic position , with different amplitudes , and maxima at different angles .",
    "an illustration of some of these single - atom angular fluorescence patterns are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] by the colored , filled curves .",
    "the black dashed curve shows the dependence of the amplitude of all possible single - atom fluorescence fringes as a function of the position of the maxima of the fringes .",
    "considering an extended atomic sample leads to the superposition of shifted fringes with different amplitudes .",
    "then , averaging over various disorder configurations leads to a fluorescence pattern with contrasted fringes around @xmath65 ( shown by the thick red curve ) .",
    "as expected , for low saturation ( @xmath44 ) this interpretation yields the same contrast @xmath53 as the interpretation based on reciprocal paths and an incoherent background .",
    "however this alternative interpretation of m - cbs allows us to go beyond the linear response theory and obtain quantitative predictions for the saturated m - cbs regime , which is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes](b ) . for @xmath66 ,",
    "the position of the maxima of each individual atomic fringe is the same as for @xmath44 . except for atoms in an ever narrower slice around the nodes of the standing wave produced by the incident laser ,",
    "though , the amplitude of these individual fringes all saturate now to the same value . after averaging over all atoms , the contrast of the total detected intensity pattern , as illustrated by the red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes](b ) , is reduced .",
    "note that for the sake of simplicity , the calculation shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringes ] is done for atoms distributed over a small region of size of the order of a few wavelengths , and the envelope of the fringes ( as expressed by the exponential function in eq . )",
    "is thus not visible .    in the discussion of the reduced contrast of cbs",
    ", another important argument has been the role of the inelastically scattered light , also known as the mollow triplet . in the single scattering regime",
    "considered here , one can solve the optical bloch equations of independent atoms , and then sum their ( independent ) scattered field . for each atom",
    ", one computes the field scattered by the oscillating dipole as being proportional to the optical coherence . in the limit of vanishing saturation , this allows to compute the total scattered intensity , as all light is elastically scattered . for larger saturation",
    "however , the optical coherence saturates and even decreases to zero for very large values of @xmath63 .",
    "in contrast , the excited state population saturates to a non zero value and allows to compute the total scattered intensity .",
    "the difference between the light scattering computed from the atomic coherence or the excited state population corresponds to inelastically scattered light ( sometimes interpreted as being stimulated by vacuum fluctuations ) . for atoms separated by more than one wavelength , emission of such inelastic photons corresponds to randomly oscillating dipoles and are thus assumed not to preserve complete phase coherence with the incident laser , resulting in a reduction of the cbs contrast , in addition to the nonlinear response . in m - cbs however , the two atoms contributing to the fringes ( i.e. the atom and its mirror image ) have strongly correlated oscillations , which preserve the relative phase , even when randomly oscillating . thus , inelastic scattering is expected to fully contribute to the m - cbs effect , leading to a lower reduction of the contrast for increasing saturation , as compared to cbs .",
    "as detailed in the appendix  [ theory ] we have derived a prediction for the m - cbs contrast based on the elastically scattered light alone or based on the light scattered using the excited state population .",
    "the resulting predictions are indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : contrastsaturation ] by `` elastic scattering only '' and `` elastic and inelastic scattering '' , respectively .",
    "we note that , for cbs , self - interference of inelastic photons has been identified to lead to a finite contrast even in the very large saturation limit  @xcite .",
    "we also note that another different , hitherto unexplained scaling for cbs with rubidium has been reported in  @xcite and might be due to a modification of the internal states of the rubidium atoms  @xcite . in any case , our model including elastic and inelastic scattering predicts m - cbs to be much more robust against saturation than cbs .    ) ) account for the precision within which our experimental parameters are known : @xmath67 mm and @xmath68 mm .",
    "the data are presented as a function of the saturation parameter @xmath63 at the center of the probe beam . ]    a precise measurement of the contrast and its dependence on the saturation parameter requires a careful data treatment , in order to fully eliminate the undesired additional signal at the camera created by the reflected m - cbs beam scattered from all the optical elements .",
    "the procedure for extracting the fluorescence signal out of our raw data is detailed in the appendix  [ datat ] . for a given mirror position ( @xmath69 mm ) and cloud size ( @xmath70 mm )",
    ", we have repeated the experimental sequence described before for several different intensities of the m - cbs beam .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a series of curves from which the absolute fringe contrast could be extracted .",
    "[ fig : contrastsaturation ] confronts the saturation behavior of the enhancement factor measured in our m - cbs setup and conventional cbs measured by other groups , as a function of the saturation parameter @xmath63 at the center of the m - cbs beam .",
    "note that we used the same definition for the contrast of cbs as we did for m - cbs before .",
    "the cbs data with strontium atoms from  @xcite have been obtained with a probe beam on resonance , and exhibit almost the maximum cbs contrast of @xmath39 in the low saturation regime .",
    "cbs was also reported with rubidium atoms which , due to their non - trivial internal structure , exhibit an overall lower contrast , even at low saturation parameter  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen , then , to present normalized values of the contrast for cbs rubidium data .",
    "note that in order to observe cbs , a high optical thickness ( @xmath71 ) is necessary to reach a significant contrast , whereas in the m - cbs set - up , the maximum contrast is achieved at low optical densities .",
    "the comparison between cbs and m - cbs data shows a completely different scaling for the contrast as a function of the saturation parameter .",
    "the m - cbs contrast follows the same scaling that we would expect from our model including elastic and inelastic scattering , allowing us to conclude that all photons contribute to m - cbs , whereas cbs interference is severely reduced in the presence of inelastic scattering .",
    "the remaining small discrepancy between theory and experiment might be explained by at least two different effects .",
    "the first one is the small , but non - zero , optical thickness of our cloud ( @xmath72 at its center ) . at small saturation parameters ,",
    "the partial re - absorption of the fluorescence light by other atoms from the cloud will change the relative amplitude of the paths of fig .",
    "[ fig : scatscheme ] that have otherwise equal amplitude , thus reducing the overall contrast .",
    "this is responsible for the large discrepancy between experimental data and the inelastic theoretical curve at small @xmath63 . on the other hand , at high saturation parameters the spectral",
    "broadening of the atomic fluorescence ( known as the mollow triplet ) may also reduce the m - cbs contrast , which is not accounted for in our model .",
    "the spectrum of inelastically scattered photons from a resonant probe beam presents sidebands displaced by @xmath73 from the atomic resonance @xcite .",
    "since the optical path for the light scattered by the atoms is different from the optical path for the light scattered by their mirror images by twice the distance from the atomic cloud to the real mirror ( @xmath74 m in our case ) , the inelastic broadening will cause a relative dephasing between both when the spectral width becomes comparable to , or bigger than , @xmath75mhz . for our highest experimental saturation parameter , @xmath76 ,",
    "the separation in frequency between the mollow sidebands is equal to @xmath77mhz , so the loss of optical coherence in the interference process is already expected to affect the m - cbs contrast .",
    "the role of the inelastic spectral broadening in the interference of the light emitted by the atoms and their mirror images will be studied in a future work .    in conclusion , we have observed coherent backscattering from a cloud of cold atoms and its mirror image .",
    "investigating the saturated regime allowed us to identify the important contribution of inelastic photons to the interference process , at odds with cbs .",
    "because this coherence effect appears in completely different regimes as compared to cbs , such as low optical densities and high saturation parameters , it can represent a very important tool for probing coherences in the atomic scattered light where cbs is not anymore observable .",
    "in particular , by an appropriate use of waveplates and different polarization channels , the m - cbs set - up should allow to select specific interference paths , which is not possible for cbs . more generally , the atom and its mirror image are strongly correlated , which allows this situation to probe non - classical light effects  @xcite .",
    "we appreciate helpful insights from thibaut jonckheere and dominique delande .",
    "we thank william gurin for his critical reading of the manuscript . this work has received financial support from fapesp , cnpq ( pve 400228/2014 - 9 ) and capes brazilian agencies .",
    "as described in the main text , at each experimental run we obtain two images : the first one is registered while the m - cbs beam impinges on the atomic cloud , and the second one is done in the same conditions , but with no atoms captured in our trap .",
    "the m - cbs reflected beam , after traversing all optical elements , creates an angular light profile on directions close to its propagation direction .",
    "the image registered in absence of atoms shows exclusively this light pattern ; the image with atoms has this pattern superposed to the atomic fluorescence , that we want to extract .",
    "all the difficulty in extracting it stems from the fact that when the atoms are also present , the m - cbs beam is partially absorbed by them , which results in a smaller signal on the camera when compared to its effect without absorption .",
    "we can thus write the azimuthal - averaged profile of the light intensity in the presence of atoms as @xmath78 where @xmath79 stands for the average transmission of the cloud after the double passage of the reflected m - cbs beam , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 for , respectively , the intensity of the laser light in the absence of atoms , and the intensity of the atomic fluorescence only . from @xmath82 , the absolute contrast can thus be extracted . out of the fringes envelope ( or , to a good approximation , for @xmath83 ) , and since we are monitoring the intensity in a narrow angle of @xmath21mrad , the fluorescence background is isotropic to an excellent approximation .",
