    "<S> the solution set of such a linear system is a ( closed convex ) polyhedron . </S>",
    "<S> optimization of linear objective functions over polyhedra is called _ linear programming _ ( lp ) . the ellipsoid method developed by shor , yudin , nemirovskii and khachiyan showed at the end of the 1970s for the first time that the lp feasibility problem ( and actually the problem of solving lps ) can be solved in ( deterministically ) polynomial time ( in the bit model of computation assuming rational coefficients ) ( </S>",

    "<S> another breakthrough came in the 1980s with the introduction of the more practical interior point methods by karmarkar and their theoretical underpinning by nesterov and nemirovskii @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the motivation to replace the prefix `` poly '' by `` spectra '' is to replace `` many '' values of linear polynomials ( the diagonal values of @xmath7 ) by the `` spectrum '' of @xmath7 ( i.e. , the set of its eigenvalues , all of which are real since @xmath7 is symmetric ) . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of lmis over systems of linear inequalities ( or of spectrahedra over polyhedra , and sdp over lp , respectively ) is a considerable gain of expressiveness which makes lmis an important tool in many areas of applied and pure mathematics . </S>",
    "<S> many problems in control theory , system identification and signal processing can be formulated using lmis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> combinatorial optimization problems can often be modeled or approximated by sdps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> lmis also find application in real algebraic geometry for finding sums of squares decompositions of polynomials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> strongly related to this , there is a hierarchy of sdp approximations to polynomial optimization problems @xcite consisting of the so - called lasserre moment relaxations . </S>",
    "<S> this hierarchy and related methods recast the field of polynomial optimization ( where the word `` polynomial '' stands for polynomial objective and polynomial constraints ) . in this article , rather than trying to solve polynomial optimization problems by using sdps , we borrow ideas and techniques from real algebraic geometry and polynomial optimization in order to get new results in the theory of semidefinite programming .    </S>",
    "<S> the price to pay for the increased expressivity of sdps is that they enjoy some less good properties . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity of solving general sdps is a very subtle issue which is often downplayed . for applications in combinatorial optimization </S>",
    "<S> , it follows typically from the general theory of the ellipsoid method @xcite or interior point methods @xcite that the translation into sdps yields a polynomial time algorithm ( see for instance ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * section 1.9 ) for exact statements ) . </S>",
    "<S> however the complexity status of the lmi feasibility problem ( the problem of deciding whether a given lmi with rational coefficients has a solution ) is largely unknown . </S>",
    "<S> what is known is essentially only that ( in the bit model ) lmi feasibility lies either in @xmath9 or outside @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this will also follow from our work below , but has been already proved by ramana @xcite in 1997 . the standard ( lagrange - slater ) dual of a semidefinite program works well when the feasible set is full - dimensional ( e.g. if there is @xmath5 with @xmath11 ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , in general strong duality can fail badly which is a serious problem since there is no easy way of reducing to the full - dimensional case ( cf .  the lmi feasibility problem mentioned above ) . </S>",
    "<S> even the corresponding version of farkas lemma fails for sdp .    </S>",
    "<S> ramana s as well as our proof relies on a extension of the standard ( lagrange - slater ) dual of an sdp which can be produced in polynomial time from the primal and for which strong duality ( more precisely zero gap and dual attainment ) always holds . </S>",
    "<S> ramana s extension is an encoding of the standard dual of a regularized primal sdp in the sense of borwein and wolkowicz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our dual , although having some superficial similarity to ramana s , relies on completely different ideas , namely sums of squares certificates of nonnegativity . </S>",
    "<S> the ideas for this _ sums of squares dual _ come from real algebraic geometry , more precisely from sums of squares representations and the real nullstellensatz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this new connection will lead to further insights in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : we fix terminology and notation in section [ sec : not ] . </S>",
    "<S> our first line of results is given in section [ sec : qm ] , where we give an algebraic characterization of infeasible lmis ( see theorem [ thm : main1 ] and corollary [ cor : bounds ] ) involving the quadratic module associated to an lmi . </S>",
    "<S> our characterization allows us to construct a new lmi whose feasibility is equivalent to the infeasibility of the original lmi . </S>",
    "<S> this new lmi is canonical from the viewpoint of positive polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> however its size is exponential in the size of the primal , so in section [ sec : ram ] we use real algebraic geometry to construct a polynomial size lmi whose feasibility is equivalent to the infeasibility of the original lmi , cf .  </S>",
    "<S> theorem [ sosram ] . at the same time theorem [ sosram ] </S>",
    "<S> gives a new type of a linear positivstellensatz characterizing linear polynomials nonnegative on a spectrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> the article concludes with section [ sec : hkm ] , where we revisit the @xcite noncommutative ( matricial ) relaxation of an lmi and investigate how our duality theory of sdp pertains to ( completely ) positive maps . </S>"
