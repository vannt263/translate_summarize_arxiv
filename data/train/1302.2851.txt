    "a lot of progress has been made in the past decade toward the understanding of statistical physics models in dimension @xmath5 .",
    "all these models , when examined at their critical point , share a strong property of conformal invariance , a property which has been established for a number of them , in the scaling limit . without aiming at exhaustivity ,",
    "let us mention the loop - erased random walk @xcite , site percolation on the triangular lattice @xcite , the ising model of ferromagnetism @xcite and its dual fk - ising representation @xcite .",
    "this property leads to a precise description of geometric objects in terms of the schramm - loewner evolution ( sle ) processes introduced in @xcite , and subsequently studied in a number of papers  let us mention the groundbreaking works @xcite , to name but a few .",
    "for percolation in particular , this led to the derivation of the so - called `` arm exponents '' , that describe the probability of observing disjoint long - range paths : for instance , at criticality , the probability for a given vertex to be connected to distance @xmath1 follows a power law : it decays like @xmath6 as @xmath7 , with @xmath8 . combining this new understanding with kesten s scaling relations @xcite",
    ", one can then describe the behavior of percolation not only at criticality , but also near criticality , i.e. through its phase transition .",
    "let us mention in particular that the density of the infinite connected component decays as @xmath9 as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "such exponents had however been predicted much earlier by powerful but non - rigorous methods , such as quantum gravity .",
    "let us mention in particular the paper @xcite , where arm exponents in their own right were first considered and derived .",
    "random graphs have been extensively used in the statistical physics literature , with a view to analyzing random spatial processes such as percolation or the ising model . studying these models in random geometries can provide a useful insight on their behavior on euclidean lattices such as @xmath12 or the triangular lattice . once derived the critical exponents in the random graph setting , the knizhnik - polyakov - zamolodchikov ( kpz ) formula @xcite predicts what the values of these exponents are for ( regular ) euclidean lattices .",
    "let us now make a bit more precise what is meant by random geometries . in the following , we consider proper embeddings of finite connected graphs in the sphere @xmath13 , where loops and multiple edges are allowed .",
    "finite planar map _ is then an equivalence class of such embeddings with respect to orientation - preserving homeomorphisms of the sphere .",
    "a planar map is _ rooted _ if it has furthermore a distinguished oriented edge @xmath14 , which is then called the _ root edge _ ( @xmath15 being the root vertex ) .",
    "faces of the map are the connected components of the complement of the union of its edges , and a map is a _ @xmath16-angulation _ if all its faces have degree @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , when @xmath17 ( resp .",
    "@xmath18 ) , we obtain triangulations ( resp . quadrangulations ) .",
    "the set of vertices of a given map will always be equipped with the graph distance . from this point of view",
    ", a random planar map can be considered as a random discrete metric space , giving a precise mathematical framework for two - dimensional quantum gravity . in particular , it is believed that random planar maps provide a good approximation for continuous random surfaces .",
    "recently , le gall @xcite and miermont @xcite proved that random planar @xmath16-angulations ( for @xmath17 or @xmath19 even ) properly rescaled converge towards a universal random surface , called the brownian map , in analogy with the fact that the brownian motion arises as the scaling limit of discrete random walks .    in this paper , rather than dealing with continuous scaling limits , we consider _ local limits _ of random maps as introduced in @xcite , which is a natural way to construct random infinite planar graphs .",
    "we define the distance @xmath20 as : for every pair of finite rooted maps @xmath21 , @xmath22 where , for @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the planar map consisting of all edges of @xmath25 that have at least one vertex at distance strictly smaller than @xmath26 from the root ( and @xmath27 by convention ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the completion of the space of all finite rooted maps with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "elements of @xmath29 that are not finite maps are called _",
    "infinite maps_. note that one can extend the function defined for finite maps @xmath30 to a continuous function @xmath31 on @xmath29 .",
    "the ball @xmath24 can be interpreted in a natural way as the union of the edges of @xmath25 that have a vertex at distance strictly smaller than @xmath26 from the root .    in a pioneering work",
    "@xcite , angel and schramm constructed the uniform infinite planar triangulation ( uipt ) as the local limit of uniformly distributed large triangulations .",
    "shortly after , krikun @xcite defined similarily the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation ( uipq ) : if @xmath32 is distributed according to the uniform measure on the set of all rooted quadrangulations with @xmath1 faces , then it is proved in @xcite that the distribution of @xmath32 converges weakly to a probability measure @xmath33 in the set of all probability measures on infinite quadrangulations : the measure @xmath33 is the law of the uipq .",
    "both the uipt and the uipq have been the focus of numerous works in recent years such as @xcite , but it is fair to say that they are not yet fully understood . in this paper , we study in more detail independent percolation on these objects .      in section [ main tools ] , we remind several important properties of planar quadrangulations that will be instrumental in the present paper .",
    "we also describe a natural bijection between quadrangulations and planar maps .",
    "this bijection allows one to use properties for quadrangulations in order to study planar maps .",
    "in particular , it provides an easy way to construct the uniform infinite planar map ( uipm ) from the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation ( uipq ) .",
    "this bijection also behaves nicely through restrictions . in particular ,",
    "uniform infinite planar @xmath16-angulations could also be constructed in this way .",
    "we then describe in section [ peeling ] a `` peeling process '' similar to the process introduced by angel in @xcite for triangulations .",
    "this process offers a useful description of the usual exploration process , that follows the interface between black ( occupied ) and white ( vacant ) sites , as a simple markov chain for which the transition probabilities are known rather explicitly .    in @xcite ,",
    "angel used this description to study site percolation on the uniform infinite planar triangulation ( uipt ) .",
    "the usual planar triangular lattice has a `` self - matching '' property that suggests that for site percolation on this lattice , one has @xmath34 , which is a celebrated result of kesten @xcite .",
    "the uipt is `` stochastically '' self - matching , and it also holds in this case that @xmath34 , in both annealed and quenched environments .",
    "similarly , @xmath12 has a self - duality property that implies that @xmath34 for bond percolation on this lattice ( strictly speaking , this is the actual result proved in @xcite ) .",
    "the uipm happens to be `` stochastically '' self - dual too , and in section [ bond_percolation ] we use the peeling process to prove that @xmath35 a.s . in this case . before that",
    ", we derive the site percolation threshold on the uipm in section [ site_percolation ] , where we show that @xmath36 a.s . in the last part of section [ bond_percolation ] ,",
    "we explain how the method allows one to compute bond percolation thresholds for other classes of random infinite planar maps .",
    "in particular , we show that for bond percolation on the uipq , @xmath37 a.s .",
    "the main result of our paper is thus the following .",
    "[ main_theorem ] for site and bond percolation on the uipm , one has , respectively , @xmath36 and @xmath35 almost surely . for bond percolation on the uipq",
    ", one has @xmath37 almost surely .",
    "recall that a finite planar map is a _ quadrangulation _ if all its faces have degree @xmath18 , that is @xmath18 adjacent edges .",
    "note that the underlying graph of a quadrangulation is bipartite .",
    "a planar map is a _ quadrangulation with a boundary _ or with _ holes _ if all its faces have degree @xmath18 , except for a number of distinguished faces which can be arbitrary even - sided polygons ( we assume these boundaries to be simple , i.e. the polygons are not `` folded '' ) . in the case",
    "when there is only one hole , of perimeter @xmath38 , we obtain what is called a quadrangulation of the @xmath38-gon . for every integer @xmath39 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the set of all rooted quadrangulations with @xmath1 faces .",
    "we also denote by @xmath41 the set of all quadrangulations of the @xmath38-gon with @xmath1 inner faces , such that the external face contains the root edge and lies on the right - hand side of it .",
    "the completion of the set @xmath42 of all rooted finite quadrangulations for the distance @xmath20 ( defined in the introduction ) is denoted by @xmath43 ; it is a subset of @xmath29 .",
    "elements of @xmath44 are called infinite rooted quadrangulations .",
    "similarily , we denote the set of finite ( resp .",
    "infinite ) quadrangulations of the @xmath38-gon by @xmath45 ( resp .",
    "@xmath46 ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .    for our purpose ,",
    "when dealing with quadrangulations , it turns out to be more convenient to work with faces rather than with edges , which leads us to introduce the new distance @xmath47 on @xmath29 defined by @xmath48 for all rooted maps @xmath25 , @xmath49 , where , for @xmath50 , we denote by @xmath51 the planar map obtained as the union of all faces of @xmath25 that have at least one vertex at distance strictly smaller than @xmath26 from the root .",
    "note that if @xmath25 is a quadrangulation , then @xmath51 is a quadrangulation with holes .",
    "let us stress that if maps with faces of arbitrarily large degrees are considered , then the distances @xmath20 and @xmath47 give rise to two different topologies .",
    "however , when restricted to quadrangulations , the two distances are equivalent ( more generally , this holds true for closed sets of maps with faces of bounded degree ) .",
    "indeed , for every @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one has @xmath54 therefore , @xmath43 can also be seen as the completion of @xmath42 for the distance @xmath47 .",
    "if we are given a quadrangulation with holes , it is natural to construct a full quadrangulation of the sphere by filling its holes of degree @xmath38 with quadrangulations of the @xmath38-gon .",
    "however , one has to make sure that filling the holes with different quadrangulations leads to different maps .",
    "this can be ensured by dealing only with _ rigid _",
    "quadrangulations , as in @xcite : we say that a rooted quadrangulation with holes @xmath55 is rigid if no quadrangulation of the sphere includes two different copies of @xmath55 with coinciding roots . as stated in @xcite , an easy adaptation of lemma 4.8 of @xcite yields that any rooted quadrangulation with holes is rigid .",
    "as we already mentioned , the law of the uipq can be constructed as the weak local limit of uniform measures on large quadrangulations .",
    "recently , curien and miermont @xcite constructed similar measures for quadrangulations with a boundary .",
    "more precicely , if @xmath56 is distributed according to the uniform measure on @xmath57 , then the distribution of @xmath56 converges weakly to a probability measure @xmath58 in the set of all probability measures on @xmath59 : the measure @xmath58 is the law of the uniform infinite planar quadrangulation of the @xmath38-gon .",
    "there is a natural bijection between rooted quadrangulations and rooted planar maps , which we now describe ( see figure [ bijection_fig ] ) .",
    "starting from a quadrangulation , its bipartite structure allows one to divide its set of vertices into two sets : _ circle - vertices _ are the vertices which are at an even distance from the root vertex ( including the root vertex itself ) , and _ square - vertices _ are the vertices at an odd distance .",
    "now , draw an edge between any two circle - vertices on the same face : we produce in this way a planar map with @xmath1 edges , rooted at the edge corresponding to the face ( in the initial quadrangulation ) which is on the left hand - side of the root edge . making explicit",
    "the reverse map is straightforward : it suffices to add one square - vertex on each face , and connect it to all vertices of this face .",
    "this bijection is used throughout the paper .",
    "the bijection between quadrangulations and planar maps.,width=491 ]    this bijection maps the uniform measure on rooted quadrangulations with @xmath1 faces to the uniform measure on rooted planar maps with @xmath1 edges .",
    "therefore , it can be used to define a ( random ) uniform infinite planar map ( uipm ) , whose law is just the weak limit of the uniform measure on rooted planar maps with @xmath1 edges for the distance @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to check that this bijection is continuous for the topologies considered .",
    "note also that this bijection maps the circle - vertices onto the vertices of the final map , while the square - vertices are mapped to faces .",
    "the dual graph of the random map can thus be obtained by simply choosing to draw edges between square - vertices , instead of between circle - vertices .",
    "this also corresponds to re - rooting the original quadrangulation by reversing orientation of the root edge .",
    "the planar map so obtained is thus `` stochastically '' self - dual ( because the uniform infinite quadrangulation is invariant under the previous re - rooting , or because the dual of a random uniform planar map with @xmath1 edges has the same law ) , which seems to indicate that the bond percolation threshold on this map is @xmath34 , as in the case of @xmath12 ( see @xcite ) which is `` truly '' self - dual .      in this short section ,",
    "we collect some enumeration results for quadrangulations that are instrumental for our purpose .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for proofs .",
    "if we denote by @xmath60 the number of quadrangulations of the @xmath38-gon with @xmath1 internal faces rooted on the boundary face , one has @xmath61 actually , the exact value of @xmath60 is not needed , but only its asymptotic behavior : @xmath62 we also need asymptotic expressions for the corresponding generating functions : @xmath63 has @xmath64 as a convergence radius , and @xmath65    following @xcite , we define the free distribution on rooted quadrangulations of a @xmath38-gon as the probability measure @xmath66 that assigns the weight @xmath67 to each quadrangulation @xmath55 of the @xmath38-gon having @xmath1 internal faces and rooted on its boundary face .",
    "we now state the spatial markov property of the uipq , grouping into a unique lemma all the properties that are needed .",
    "let us denote by @xmath68 the uipq , and let @xmath69 be a rigid quadrangulation with @xmath1 internal faces and @xmath70 boundary faces , with perimeters @xmath71 .",
    "* one has @xmath72 + when @xmath73 holds , let us denote by @xmath74 the component of the uipq in the @xmath75th face . *",
    "almost surely , only one of these components is infinite : the probability that it is @xmath76 is given by the @xmath77th term in the previous sum , i.e. @xmath78 * if we condition on the event that @xmath79 , and that the external faces of @xmath69 all contain finitely many vertices of @xmath80 , except ( possibly ) the @xmath77th one , then * * the quadrangulations @xmath81 are independent , * * @xmath76 has the same distribution as the uipq of the @xmath82-gon , * * and for @xmath83 , @xmath74 is distributed as the free quadrangulation of a @xmath84-gon .    this spatial markov property is proved in @xcite for uniform triangulations , and a strictly identical proof applies in our setting of quadrangulations .",
    "we now describe the peeling process , a growth process that can be used to sample planar maps . it has first been used in physics @xcite to derive heuristics for the scaling limit of 2-dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "later , angel @xcite defined rigourously this process for triangulations , and used it to study volume growth and site percolation on the uipt .",
    "benjamini and curien @xcite adapted this process to quadrangulations in order to prove that the simple random walk on the uipq is subdiffusive .",
    "we will make extensive use of this process to study both site and bond percolation on the uipm associated with the uipq .",
    "let @xmath68 be the uipq .",
    "the peeling process is a sequence @xmath85 of ( finite ) random quadrangulations with simple boundary , such that :    * @xmath86 is the root edge of @xmath68 and one has @xmath87 .",
    "* let @xmath88 be the fitration generated by @xmath89 .",
    "then conditionally on @xmath88 , the part of @xmath68 that has not been discovered yet , that is @xmath90 , is a uipq of the @xmath91-gon .",
    "let us now describe the conditional distribution of @xmath92 knowing @xmath88 , and write down explicit transition probabilities .",
    "first , we have to choose an oriented edge @xmath93 on @xmath94 .",
    "any choice , deterministic or random , is acceptable as long as it depends only on @xmath88 , and @xmath32 lies on the right hand side of @xmath93 .",
    "the map @xmath90 rooted at @xmath93 is a uipq of the @xmath91-gon .",
    "let @xmath95 , and denote the vertices of @xmath94 by @xmath96 so that @xmath97 ( see figure [ peeling_fig ] ) .",
    "now , let us reveal the face of @xmath90 containing @xmath93 .",
    "following the orientation given by @xmath93 , we denote the vertices of this face by @xmath98 .",
    "four cases may occur , depending on whether @xmath99 and / or @xmath100 belong to @xmath94 : we now describe @xmath92 in each case , and give the corresponding probability .    discovering a new face during the peeling process .",
    "note that @xmath100 can coincide with @xmath101 , and @xmath99 can coincide with @xmath102  in the second and third cases , respectively.,width=491 ]    * @xmath103 ( figure [ peeling_fig ] , left ) . in this case",
    ", we set @xmath92 to be the union of @xmath32 and the face discovered .",
    "therefore , @xmath104 is a quadrangulation of a @xmath105-gon , and the spatial markov property ensures that conditionally on this event and @xmath88 , the map @xmath104 is a uipq of the @xmath105-gon .",
    "hence , conditionally on @xmath88 , this event has probability @xmath106 ( using ) . * @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 ( figure [ peeling_fig ] , middle left ) . in this case",
    ", the new face divides the remaining part of @xmath68 into two separate quadrangulations : @xmath110 with perimeter @xmath111 and @xmath112 with perimeter @xmath113 .",
    "conditionally on this event and @xmath88 , exactly one of these two quadrangulations is infinite .",
    "if it is @xmath110 , the spatial markov property ensures that it is a uipq of the @xmath114-gon , while @xmath112 is independent of @xmath110 and is a free quadrangulation of the @xmath115-gon .",
    "we set @xmath92 to be the union of @xmath32 , the face discovered , and @xmath112 , so that @xmath116 .",
    "using , the probability of this event is given by @xmath117 if @xmath112 is infinite , the situation is similar , and we set @xmath92 to be the union of @xmath32 , the face discovered , and @xmath110 , so that @xmath118 .",
    "the corresponding probability is @xmath119 * @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 ( figure [ peeling_fig ] , middle right ) .",
    "the situation is similar to the second case , and conditionally on this event and @xmath88 , either @xmath123 is a uipq of the @xmath124-gon , or @xmath125 is a uipq of the @xmath126-gon .",
    "the respective probabilities are : @xmath127 * @xmath121 and @xmath128 with @xmath129 ( figure [ peeling_fig ] , right ) . in this case",
    ", the new face divides the remaining part of @xmath68 into three separate quadrangulations : @xmath110 with perimeter @xmath124 , @xmath130 with perimeter @xmath131 , and @xmath112 with perimeter @xmath132 . here",
    "again , the spatial markov property ensures that conditionally on the corresponding event and @xmath88 , exactly one of these quadrangulations is infinite , and we set @xmath92 to be the union of @xmath32 , the face discovered , and the other two finite quadrangulations .",
    "the corresponding probabilities are given by : @xmath133    let us insist on the fact that the peeling procedure that we just described , and its transition probabilities , do not depend on the choice of the edge @xmath93 , provided that at each step @xmath1 , this choice depends only on @xmath88 .",
    "this will allow us to study both site and bond percolation on the uipm by following the percolation interface along the way .",
    "this peeling procedure also allowed benjamini and curien @xcite to study the simple random walk on the uipq .",
    "a more straightforward yet very useful consequence of this fact is that the sequence @xmath134 is a homogeneous markov chain whose transition probabilities do not depend on the particular peeling process performed .",
    "for instance , let us write @xmath135 .",
    "then one has , for this increment @xmath136 , using the transition probabilities of the peeling process that we derived explicitly , @xmath137 ( corresponding to case ( 1 ) above ) , and for every @xmath138 , @xmath139 ( combining cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for the first term , and ( 4 ) for the second term ) . of particular interest is the following asymptotics proven in theorem 5 of @xcite :    [ peelingasymptotics ] if @xmath140 is generated by a peeling procedure of the uipq , then one has @xmath141 is a random process , @xmath142 means that for some @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 almost surely .",
    "this property is proved in @xcite by using geometric properties of the uipq , without appealing to the peeling process directly . however , it should also be possible to prove these asymptotics by using the explicit transition probabilities for the peeling process , and the enumeration results of section [ combinatorics ] . an easy consequence of lemma [ peelingasymptotics ]  actually , only the fact that @xmath146 a.s .",
    " that will be useful for our purpose is the following :    [ expectx ] let @xmath140 be generated by a peeling procedure of the uipq , and set @xmath135 .",
    "then one has @xmath147",

    "let us denote by @xmath155 a random variable with law given by @xmath156 since @xmath157 almost surely as @xmath1 grows , an argument of dominated convergence shows that @xmath158 $ ] converges to @xmath159 $ ] .",

    "we introduce the series @xmath160 with convergence radius @xmath161 .",
    "the series @xmath162 corresponds to the generating series of ternary trees , and classical arguments ( see @xcite , ( 5.29 ) ) yield @xmath163 from here , basic computations give @xmath164    to conclude this section , let us stress that the peeling procedure for the uipq also provides a sampling of the uipm .",
    "indeed , consider @xmath85 a peeling - generated sequence for the uipq , and , for every @xmath165 , let @xmath166 be the map associated with @xmath32 by the bijection of section [ bijection ] : there is an edge of @xmath166 inside each face of @xmath32 ( except for the boundary face ) .",
    "we obtain in this way an increasing sequence of maps , which are all submaps of @xmath167 .",
    "note that different quadrangulations @xmath32 may produce the same map @xmath166 .",
    "in fact there is more information on the uipm in @xmath32 than in @xmath166 , since @xmath32 also gives information on the faces of @xmath167 .",
    "indeed , let us consider two edges of @xmath166 .",
    "considering only @xmath166 , it is not possible to say if the two edges are part of the same face in @xmath167 .",
    "however , this information is available in @xmath32 : the two edges belong to the same face of @xmath167 _ iff _ their associated quadrangles share a common square - vertex in @xmath32 .",
    "this is not problematic for our purpose , since we are not interested in the sequence @xmath168 by itself .",
    "in this section , we consider bernoulli site percolation on the uipm : the vertices are colored , independently of each other , _ black _ with probability @xmath169 , and _ white _ with probability @xmath170 .",
    "we prove the first part of theorem [ main_theorem ] : for site percolation on the uipm , the percolation threshold is almost surely @xmath171      consider @xmath167 the uipm , and @xmath68 the associated uipq .",
    "suppose that each vertex of @xmath167 is colored independently at random , black with probability @xmath169 and white with probability @xmath170 ( in @xmath68 , this corresponds to a coloring of circle - vertices only ) .",
    "we are interested in percolation of the origin , i.e. the existence of an infinite black connected component containing the origin .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that the root vertex of @xmath167  which is also the root vertex of @xmath68  is colored black .",
    "we can sample percolation on the uipm simultaneously with a peeling process of the uipq : each time a new vertex of the uipm is added , we color it randomly , independently of all previous steps . note that if at some step @xmath1 , all the vertices of the uipm that are on the boundary @xmath94 are white , then these vertices separate from infinity ( in @xmath167 ) the root vertex , which therefore does not percolate ( for black sites ) .",
    "now , recall that we can choose where the next quadrangle is revealed at each step of the peeling process .",
    "in particular , we can let this choice depend on the percolation configuration sampled so far . on the one hand , if all the vertices of the uipm that are on the boundary @xmath94 have the same color , then we can make an arbitrary choice . on the other hand , if there are white and black vertices on @xmath94 , then we can ensure that @xmath94 remains divided in two arcs : one arc with black vertices only , and the other one with white vertices only .",
    "if we then follow the orientation of the boundary , there is a unique choice of three consecutive vertices @xmath102 , @xmath101 , and @xmath172 , where @xmath102 and @xmath172 are black and white respectively , and @xmath101 is a square - vertex between them .",
    "we then reveal the quadrangle on the left side of the oriented edge @xmath173 ( see figure [ siteperc ] ) .",
    "if this rule is followed , it is easy to see that all black vertices on @xmath94 belong to the percolation cluster containing the root vertex of @xmath167 , as long as the boundary does not become totally white , which corresponds to detecting a white circuit .",
    "however , note that white vertices of @xmath94 do not necessarily belong to the same white cluster , so black and white sites do not play symmetric roles in this process : one can not simply use the symmetry @xmath174 .",
    "the connectedness of white sites corresponds to `` @xmath175-connectedness '' , as it is usually called for percolation on planar graphs such as @xmath12 .",
    "this figure shows how percolation is sampled during the peeling process .",
    "the arrows on each figure indicate the possible rerootings for the next peeling step .",
    "note that in the middle right case , if @xmath121 is white and if the quadrangulation on the right is infinite , then a circuit of white vertices separates the root vertex from infinity , so percolation does not occur.,width=491 ]    let us denote by @xmath176 the number of black vertices on @xmath94 , @xmath177 the number of white vertices , and by @xmath88 the filtration generated by @xmath178 and their coloring .",
