    "the tevatron experiments search for direct higgs boson production in the mass range above the lep limit using associated higgs production ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) and gluon fusion ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the main tools are jet reconstruction , @xmath8 tagging and lepton identification .",
    "the tagging of @xmath8 jets from higgs decays is usually performed by requiring tracks with large impact parameters or by reconstructing secondary vertices .",
    "more advanced analyses will combine these and other variables in neural nets .",
    "events with neutrinos in the final state are identified using missing transverse energy .",
    "the reconstruction of all these variables require excellent performance of all detector components .",
    "there are different types of background to the higgs search .",
    "an important source of background are multi - jet events ( qcd background ) .",
    "this background and the instrumental background due to mis - identified leptons or @xmath8-jets is not very well simulated by monte carlo .",
    "its shape and normalisation is therefore taken from data using control samples .",
    "electroweak background processes such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 pair production often dominate at the final stages of the selection ; these are simulated using monte carlo programs .    at the time of writing these proceedings , the two tevatron experiments have each recorded about 1.5 fb@xmath11 of luminosity .",
    "most results presented here are based on data corresponding to about 0.3 fb@xmath11 .",
    "the preliminary results of the two collaborations are accessible through their web pages  @xcite .",
    "in the higgs mass region below 135 gev the most important search channels are the associated production of a higgs and a @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson .",
    "the largest production cross - section is due to the process @xmath7 , it is about @xmath12  pb for a higgs mass of 115 gev .",
    "however , the higgs boson predominantly decays into @xmath8 quarks in this mass range and the qcd background is too large in this final state .",
    "the process @xmath7 is therefore not a viable search channel .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 channels with the vector boson decaying into leptons have much lower cross - sections but the lepton tag and cuts on missing transverse energy help to reduce the background significantly .",
    "this final state consists of two @xmath8 jets from the higgs boson and a charged lepton ( electron or muon ) and a neutrino from the @xmath0 boson .",
    "d  therefore selects events with one or two tagged @xmath8-jets , one isolated lepton with a transverse momentum @xmath16  gev and missing transverse energy @xmath17 gev .",
    "the main backgrounds are @xmath0 production in association with two heavy flavour jets and @xmath10 production .",
    "this search yields an upper limit on the @xmath13 production cross - section in the range 2.4 pb to 2.9 pb for higgs masses between 105 gev and 145 gev .",
    "the average integrated luminosity is 378 pb@xmath11 .",
    "cdf performed a similar analysis requiring one or two tagged b - jets with @xmath18  gev , an electron or a muon with @xmath16 gev and @xmath19  gev  @xcite .",
    "this search has recently been updated to include data with an integrated luminosity of @xmath20  pb@xmath11 , yielding limits on the cross - section @xmath21 between 3.9  pb and 1.3  pb for the mass range 110  gev to 150  gev  @xcite .",
    "this channel has very good sensitivity because of the large branching ratios for @xmath23 and @xmath24 decays .",
    "since the two b - jets are boosted in the transverse direction , the signature for the final state are acoplanar di - jets in contrast to most qcd di - jet events which are expected to be back - to - back in the transverse plane .",
    "in addition , large missing transverse energy ( d  : @xmath25  gev , cdf : @xmath26  gev ) is required .",
    "main background sources are @xmath27 production in association with heavy flavour jets , qcd events and @xmath10 pairs .",
    "a search in 260 pb@xmath11 of data has been published by d  @xcite giving a limit on @xmath28 of 3.4 - 2.5  pb for masses 105 - 135  gev .",
    "the most recent preliminary cdf result includes 973 pb@xmath11 of data  @xcite .      in this channel",
    "the @xmath1 boson is reconstructed by its decay into two high-@xmath30 isolated muons or electrons .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath1 and two b - tagged jets are then used to select the higgs signal .",
    "the main background sources are @xmath1 plus heavy jets and @xmath10 production .",
    "d  measured a limit on @xmath28 between 6.1  pb and 4.7  pb in the higgs mass range 115 - 145  gev using 320 - 389  pb@xmath11 of data .",
    "cdf performed a similar analysis using about 1 fb@xmath11 of data and obtained a limit of 2.0 - 1.1  pb in the mass range 110 - 150  gev  @xcite .",
    "the dominant decay mode for higher higgs masses is @xmath31 .",
    "leptonic decays of the w bosons are therefore used to suppress qcd background .",
    "the signature of the @xmath33 channel is two high-@xmath30 isolated leptons with small azimuthal separation , @xmath34 , due to the spin - correlation between the final - state leptons in the decay of the spin-0 higgs boson .",
    "in contrast , the lepton pairs from @xmath1 decays are predominantly back - to - back in @xmath35 .",
    "the experiments currently use the @xmath0 decays into electrons or muons for this search . the cdf limit on @xmath36 using 360",

    "the higgs boson is produced in association with a @xmath0 boson .",
    "d  has performed an analysis with data corresponding to 360 - 380  pb@xmath11 , requiring two opposite sign isolated leptons ( @xmath38 ) with @xmath39  gev , one originating from the @xmath40 decay and one from the associated @xmath0 boson , and @xmath19  gev  @xcite .",
    "this opposite sign charge requirement is very powerful in rejecting background from @xmath1 production .",
    "the remaining background is either due to di - boson production or due to charge mis - measurements .",
    "the upper limit on the cross - section @xmath41 is between 3.2  pb and 2.8  pb for higgs masses from 115  gev to 175  gev .",

    "cl cross - section ratios for the combined cdf and d  analyses .",
    "the expected @xmath4 cl ratio for both experiments are also shown .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the difference between the expected limits for cdf and d  is mainly due to the different size data samples that have been analysed in the low and high mass high region , the overall sensitivity shown is therefore closer to the sensitivity of a single experiment with 1 fb@xmath11 .",
    "the cdf and d  experiments at fermilab s tevatron have searched for the sm higgs boson in a variety of channel , using data corresponding to integrated luminosities between 0.2  fb@xmath11 and 1  fb@xmath11 .",
    "the cross - section limits are about a factor ten above the sm expectation for a higgs boson mass of 115 gev . a long list of improvements - in addition to adding more data - are expected to lead to a significant increase in the sensitivity .",
    "the most important improvements are better @xmath8 tagging using neural net algorithms , improvements of the di - jet mass resolution to separate the higgs signal from the background , the inclusion of new channels such as @xmath42 and the use of advanced analysis techniques such as neural nets .",
    "this and more data will give the tevatron experiments a good chance to exclude a sm higgs boson ( or find indications for its existence ) in the low mass region above the lep limit of 114.4  gev .",
