    "saturn s largest moon titan has a thick ( 1.45  bar ) atmosphere composed primarily of molecular nitrogen ( @xmath8% ) and methane ( approximately @xmath9% ) .",
    "remote and in - situ measurements ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have also revealed the presence of a diverse population of trace hydrocarbons and nitrogen - bearing compounds , the presence of which can be explained as a consequence of a complex gas - phase photochemistry , driven by photodissociation / ionization and cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "multiple studies have predicted the existence of ethyl cyanide ( c@xmath0h@xmath1cn , also known as propionitrile ) on titan , but a firm confirmation of its presence has been elusive until now .",
    "@xcite suggested that c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  could be formed as a recombination product of complex nitrile ions produced in three - body association reactions in the dense , lower atmosphere .",
    "more recent photochemical models by @xcite and @xcite predict c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  to be abundant throughout the atmosphere . in laboratory plasma - discharge experiments designed to simulate titan s photochemistry ,",
    "c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  is among the most abundant molecules produced ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and crystalline c@xmath0h@xmath1cn has been suggested as an explanation for the broad emission feature at 221  @xmath10 seen in the voyager iris data @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , previous spectroscopic studies have failed to find gas - phase ethyl cyanide ; abundance upper limits have been obtained of @xmath11 from the cassini composite infrared spectrometer ( cirs ) and @xmath12 from iram 30-m microwave spectroscopy ( @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the presence of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  was strongly implied by the detection of c@xmath0h@xmath1cnh@xmath2 by the cassini ion and neutral mass spectrometer ( inms ) @xcite .",
    "this nitrile ion was theorized to form primarily by proton transfer from hcnh@xmath2 and c@xmath0h@xmath1@xmath2 to neutral c@xmath0h@xmath1cn .",
    "a spectroscopic detection of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  would provide the first conclusive proof for the presence of ethyl cyanide in titan s atmosphere and help validate the conclusions of the inms studies .",
    "gas - phase synthesis of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn is not well understood , and the chemical models of @xcite and @xcite differ in their predicted abundances by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "accurate measurements of the c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  atmospheric distribution are required in order to constrain models for the formation of nitriles and other large organic molecules , which will lead to improvements in our understanding of the complex photochemistry occurring on titan and on other bodies with nitrogen and methane - rich atmospheres .    in this study , we employ millimeter - wave data obtained from the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) science archive to search for and map rotational emission lines from c@xmath0h@xmath1cn in titan s atmosphere , and compare the spatial distribution of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  emission with that of other , previously - identified molecules .",
    "interferometric observations of titan were made between ut 2012 - 07 - 03 23:22:14 and 2012 - 07 - 04 01:06:18 as part of alma project 2011.0.00319.s ( for the purpose of flux calibration ) .",
    "two 4 minute integrations were obtained using the dual - sideband band 6 receiver , with twenty 12-m antennae in the telescope array , providing baselines in the range 21 - 402  m. due to the high sensitivity of alma , even these short integrations permitted the detection of weak spectral lines on titan .",
    "the correlator was configured to observe four basebands , with frequencies 221.48 - 223.35  ghz and 223.48 - 225.35  ghz in the lower sideband , and 236.48 - 238.36  ghz and 239.48 - 241.36  ghz in the upper sideband , with 3840 channels per spectral window .",
    "the channel spacing was 488  khz which ( after hanning smoothing by the correlator ) , leads to a spectral resolution of 976  khz ( or @xmath13  at 224  ghz ) .",
    "weather conditions were good , with 1.7  mm of precipitable water vapor at zenith .",
    "the bright quasar 3c279 was observed for bandpass calibration .",
    "the telescope was configured to track titan s ephemeris position , updating the coordinates of the phase center in real - time .",
    "the data obtained from the alma science archive were already processed using the standard scripts and protocols provided by the joint alma observatory .",
    "this included routine flagging , bandpass calibration and complex gain calibration .",
    "the measured continuum flux density for each baseline was scaled to match the butler - jpl - horizons 2010 titan flux model ( see alma memo # 594 ) , which is expected to be accurate to within 15% .",
    "continuum - subtraction of the visibility amplitudes was performed using the uvcontsub task in the nrao casa software ( version 4.2.1 ) @xcite , and imaging was carried out using the clean task .",
    "deconvolution of the point - spread function ( psf ) was performed for each spectral channel using the hogbom algorithm , with natural visibility weighting and a threshold flux level of twice the expected rms noise .",
    "the image pixel sizes were set to @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting spatial resolution ( fwhm of the gaussian restoring beam at 223.5  ghz ) was @xmath15 ( long axis @xmath16 clockwise from celestial north ) .",
    "this resolution element corresponds to @xmath17  km at titan s geocentric distance of 9.51  au at the time of observation ( compared with titan s 5,150  km diameter ) .",
    "the images were transformed from equatorial coordinates to ( projected ) linear distances with respect to the center of titan , and the spectral coordinate scale of each image was doppler - shifted to titan s rest frame using the jpl horizons topocentric radial velocity .     centered on titan .",

    "confirmation of the presence of ethyl cyanide in titan s atmosphere provides an important test and validation of the cassini inms result . although a near - perfect fit to our observed alma spectrum was obtained using a step model for the c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  vmr profile ( with cutoff altitude at 300  km ) , a smoothly - varying profile is expected to be more realistic .",
    "the shape of the retrieved ` gradient ' profile ( shown by the solid blue curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a ) is constrained primarily by the requirement of a low abundance at @xmath18  km , and is largely unconstrained at altitudes above about 600  km , where the atmospheric density is low .",
    "similar to the case of hnc @xcite , the steep vertical abundance gradient for c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  and its concentration at altitudes @xmath5  km are consistent with production in the upper atmosphere , combined with a relatively short chemical lifetime that prevents it from building up at lower altitudes through vertical mixing .    a plausible alternative to the best - fitting gradient profile above 700  km is indicated with a dotted vertical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a , passing through the @xmath19 abundance at @xmath20  km , measured by @xcite .",
    "the modeled c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  column density above 700  km is small , so this alternative curve also provides an excellent fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "the altitude of peak sensitivity of our measurements depends on the assumed vmr profile shape , but for reasonable profiles that do not exceed the abundance measurement of @xcite at high altitude , the resulting spectra are most sensitive to c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  at altitudes less than 600  km .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : models]a , we plot for comparison the c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  vmr profiles predicted by the chemical models of @xcite and @xcite . in the @xmath21 - 600  km region from which the majority of our observed emission originates , neither chemical model matches well with our retrieved vmr profiles .",
    "the @xcite model produces c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  through the reaction of excited nitrogen atoms with c@xmath4h@xmath22 , and the resulting stratospheric / mesospheric abundance is up to three orders of magnitude lower than implied by our observations .",
    "this indicates that a significant c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  production channel is missing from the model .",
    "conversely , c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  abundances calculated by @xcite exceed those of our retrieved profiles by 1 - 3 orders of magnitude at altitudes 100 - 300  km , where our model is quite well constrained . in their model , c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  is produced from the ternary association reaction of ch@xmath0cn and ch@xmath4 ( + m ) , which has not been measured in the laboratory . the apparent shortcomings of these models highlight a lack of knowledge regarding titan s c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  chemistry . improved chemical models are currently in development ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the production of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  in the mid and upper atmosphere on titan could plausibly be the result of gas - phase chemistry involving binary ion - molecule or neutral - neutral reactions .",
    "production and subsequent release from the surfaces of solid ( haze ) particles or ices also can not be ruled out  c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  is abundant in the environments surrounding young stellar objects , where its formation is generally believed to result from reactions on the surfaces of dust grains ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as yet , there are no known neutral gas - phase routes to the formation of ethyl cyanide in low pressure astrophysical environments , and our results identify a clear need for further laboratory and theoretical studies in this regard .",
    "recombination of c@xmath0h@xmath1cnh@xmath2 is known to produce c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  @xcite , so ion - molecule synthesis of this nitrile ion should also be examined .      combining the derived vertical profile with the observed emission maps ,",
    "the three - dimensional distribution of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  relative to other atmospheric species provides important clues regarding its origin .",
    "the observed molecular contour maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] show evidence for significant north - south extension of each species .",
    "this extension is consistent with the presence of emission from near both poles , which is highlighted in the case of hc@xmath4n , for which two closely - separated emission components ( one over each pole ) could plausibly give rise to the observed contour structure .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed the hc@xmath4n @xmath23 transition towards titan in november 2013 at slightly higher angular resolution , and identified two clear emission peaks for this molecule , one centered near each pole .",
    "such polar enhancement(s ) are characteristic of the abundance patterns seen by voyager and cassini in photochemical product species , theorized to result from the combined effects of titan s atmospheric chemistry and circulation @xcite .    the c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  emission map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maps]a ) shows a surprising spatial distribution , with a significant ( @xmath24 ) flux enhancement over the southern pole relative to the north .",
    "this is the opposite trend to that observed for the other three species , which show clear enhancements in the northern hemisphere .",
    "differences in stratospheric temperature between titan s northern and southern hemispheres have been found to be generally @xmath25% @xcite .",
    "our observed emission lines are relatively invariant to such small temperature changes , so spatial variations in the gas temperature are an unlikely explanation for the observed asymmetries .",
    "molecular abundance peaks near titan s north pole have previously been identified for hc@xmath4n and ch@xmath4cch ( during northern winter ) , so it seems plausible that the emission structures observed with alma are due to intrinsic latitudinal abundance variations . as a caveat ,",
    "the temperatures in titan s polar mesosphere are known to vary on rapid timescales ( _ e.g. _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and temperature information for the epoch of our observations is lacking , so further work will be needed to firmly establish the relative distributions of these species .",
    "an explanation for the southerly c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  peak is due to the transition of titan s seasons from northern winter in 2002 to * ( late ) * northern spring in 2012 . during this time",
    ", the reversal of titan s main atmospheric circulation cell is expected to channel fresh photochemical products from mid latitudes towards the south pole @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , gases transported north during the previous season remain concentrated around the north pole , undergoing slow photochemical destruction . following the northern winter , species with longer chemical lifetimes should remain in the north for longer while those with shorter lifetimes disappear , and re - appear in the south .",
    "our maps therefore suggest a shorter chemical lifetime for c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  than for hc@xmath4n , ch@xmath4cn and ch@xmath4cch .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested by observing the evolution of the distributions of these species over the coming years , particularly during the transition from northern spring to the summer solstice in 2017 .",
    "nineteen separate emission features from 27 rotational transitions of c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  were detected in titan s atmosphere using alma archival spectra recorded in july 2012 .",
    "radiative transfer modeling indicates that most of the observed c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  is concentrated at altitudes @xmath26  km .",
    "this is consistent with production in the upper atmosphere , combined with a relatively short chemical lifetime that inhibits downward mixing .",
    "the observed c@xmath0h@xmath1cn  emission maps suggest a higher abundance in the south polar region than the north ( in contrast to hc@xmath4n , ch@xmath4cn , and ch@xmath4cch , which peak in the north ) , again consistent with a relatively short chemical lifetime for c@xmath0h@xmath1cn and south polar subsidence .",
    "this possibility can be verified through future measurements of temporal variations in the spatial distributions of the observed species with respect to titan s changing seasons .",
