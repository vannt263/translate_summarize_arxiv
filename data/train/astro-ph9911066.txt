    "we have studied a class of cosmological models in which the universal scale factor grows as a power of the age of the universe ( @xmath9 ) and concluded that such models are not viable since constraints on the present age of the universe and from the magnitude - redshift relation favor @xmath10 , while those from the abundances of the light elements produced during primordial nucleosynthesis require that @xmath11 lie in a very narrow range around 0.55  @xcite .",
    "successful primordial nucleosynthesis provides a very stringent constraint , requiring that a viable model simultaneously account for the observationally inferred primordial abundances of deuterium , helium-3 , helium-4 and lithium-7 .",
    "for example , if the nucleosynthesis constraint is satisfied , the present universe would be very young ; @xmath12 for a hubble parameter @xmath13 ( or , requiring @xmath14 for @xmath15 ) .",
    "recently , sethi @xcite noted that cosmologies where the scale factor grows linearly with time may produce the correct amount of he _ provided that _ the universal baryon fraction is sufficiently large . at first",
    "this result might seem counter - intuitive since such a universe would have been very old at the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) suggesting that all neutrons have decayed and are unavailable to be incorporated in he . in fact , as sethi correctly pointed out , the expansion rate is so slow that the weak reactions remain in equilibrium sufficiently long to permit a  simmering \" synthesis of the required amount of he .",
    "however , such an old universe also leaves more time to burn away d and 3 so that no astrophysically significant amounts can survive .",
    "the observations of deuterium in high - redshift , low - metallicity qso absorbers  @xcite , the observations of lithium in very old , very metal - poor halo stars ( the  spite plateau \" )  @xcite , and those of helium in low - metallicity extragalactic regions  @xcite require an internally consistent primordial origin .",
    "the sethi claim that deuterium could have a non - primordial origin is without basis as shown long ago by epstein , lattimer & schramm  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the paper of sethi @xcite prompted us to reinvestigate primordial nucleosynthesis in those power - law cosmologies which may produce  interesting \" amounts of he so as to study the predicted yields for d , 3 , and li .",
    "preliminaries_. for a power - law cosmology it is assumed that the scale factor varies as a power of the age independent of the cosmological epoch : a / a_0 = ( t / t_0)^ = ( 1 + z)^-1 , [ abya0 ] where the subscript ` 0 ' refers throughout to the present time and ` @xmath16 ' is the redshift .",
    "we may relate the present cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) temperature to that at any earlier epoch by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 accounts for any entropy production . for the models we consider ,",
    "@xmath19 after electron - positron annihilation . the hubble parameter is then given by h==()^ .",
    "[ hubble ] the second equality should be read with the understanding that it is not valid during the epoch of electron - positron annhilation due to the non - adiabatic nature of annhilations . power - law cosmologies with large @xmath11 share the common feature that the slow universal expansion rate permits neutrinos to remain in equilibrium until after electron - positron annihilation has ended so that neutrino and photon temperatures remain equal . in this case the entropy factor for @xmath20 in eq .",
    "[ hubble ] is , = ( 29/43)^1/3 in contrast to the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) value of @xmath21 . as increases , the expansion rate at a fixed temperature decreases due to the dominant effect of the @xmath22 power .",
    "another useful way to view this is that at a fixed temperature , a power - law universe with a larger @xmath11 is older . as a consequence of the decreasing expansion rate ,",
    "the reactions remain in equilibrium longer . in particular ,",
    "as pointed out by sethi @xcite for the linear expansion model ( @xmath23 ) , the weak interactions remain in equilibrium to much lower temperatures than in the sbbn scenario , allowing neutrons and protons to maintain equilibrium at temperatures below 100 kev , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ equib ] . as is evident from fig .",
    "[ equib ] , the he production rate below about @xmath24 is too slow to maintain nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "however , the presence of neutrons in equilibrium and the enormous amount of time available for nucleosynthesis during neutron - proton equilibrium ( compared to sbbn ) make it possible to build up a significant abundance of he  @xcite .",
    "+    the above discussion is not restricted to @xmath23 , but applies for all values of @xmath11 which are sufficiently large ( so that the expansion rate is sufficiently small ) to allow neutrons to stay in equilibrium long enough to enable synthesis of he in sufficient amounts , as we show in fig .",
    "[ iso - he4 ] .",
    "although we explore a larger range in @xmath11 in this paper , we present detailed results for @xmath25 , a range consistent with the age and expansion rate of the universe , and we check these results for consistency with independent ( , non - bbn ) constraints on the baryon density . the iso - abundance contours in fig .",
    "2 show clearly that as @xmath11 decreases towards 0.75 , a larger baryon density is required to produce the same abundance of he .",
    "for example , although @xmath26 can be synthesized in the @xmath27 model , the density of baryons required is very large : @xmath28 .",
    "these ` large @xmath29 ' models are constrained by dynamical estimates of the mass density , an issue we discuss later .     +    _",
    "abundance_. in an earlier study  @xcite , we showed that there is a very small region , centered on @xmath30 , for which the light elements can be produced in abundances similar to those predicted by sbbn .",
    "but , this small window is closed by the snia magnitude - redshift data  @xcite . here",
    "we are concerned with larger values of @xmath11 and , correspondingly , larger baryon - to - photon ratios ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "first we consider the nucleosynthesis of he in these models .",
    "figure  [ iso - he4 ] shows the connection between the baryon density ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ) and @xmath11 set by the requirement that the primordial helium mass fraction lie in the generous range @xmath34 .",
    "we have included in fig .",
    "[ iso - he4 ] the region investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath35 , as well . to understand the features in fig .",
    "[ iso - he4 ] , we need to isolate the important factors controlling the synthesis of helium . in sbbn ,",
    "the he abundance is essentially controlled by the number density ratio of neutrons to protons ( @xmath36 ) at the start of nucleosynthesis ( @xmath37  kev ) .",
    "this ratio in turn is determined by ( 1 ) the @xmath38 ratio at ` freeze - out ' ( @xmath39 ) of the neutron - proton interconversion rates which may be approximated by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the neutron - proton mass difference and , ( 2 ) the time available for neutrons to decay after freeze - out , @xmath42 .",
    "in contrast , for power - law cosmologies another factor comes into play ",
    "the time available for nucleosynthesis , @xmath43 , before the nuclear reactions freeze - out . for larger @xmath11 , the expansion rate of the universe ( at fixed temperature ) is smaller and the universe is older .",
    "hence , for larger @xmath11 neutrons remain in equilibrium longer and the freeze - out temperature ( @xmath44 ) is smaller , so that @xmath45  is smaller .",
    "however , the effect of the increase in @xmath43 as @xmath11 increases dominates that due to the change in @xmath44 . for @xmath46",
    "the freeze - out temperature is around 4  mev whereas for @xmath30 , @xmath47  mev which implies a decrease in @xmath48 by a factor of about 2.5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the age of the universe at @xmath49  kev ( about the temperature when sbbn ends ) is a factor of 25 larger for @xmath50 relative to that for @xmath46 .",
    "thus , for the same @xmath31 , increasing @xmath11 from 0.50 to 0.55 has the effect of increasing the @xmath51he abundance because more time is available for nucleosynthesis .",
    "but , since decreasing the baryon density decreases the nuclear reaction rates leading to a decrease in @xmath51he , we may understand the trend of the smaller baryon density requirement as @xmath11 increases from 0.50 to about 0.55 , even though the decrease in @xmath44 opposes this effect . the time - delay between ` freeze - out ' and bbn , @xmath52 , which has , until now , been much smaller than @xmath53 , becomes comparable to it at @xmath54 .",
    "since a larger @xmath11 results in an older universe at a fixed temperature , @xmath52  increases with @xmath11 .",
    "thus for @xmath55 ,  is increasingly suppressed ( exponentially ) as @xmath11 is increased .",
    "the only way to compensate for this is by increasing @xmath56 ( since @xmath57 ) , which may be achieved by increasing the baryon density .",
    "but since @xmath56 depends only logarithmically on the baryon density  @xcite , this accounts for the exponential rise in the required value of @xmath58 as @xmath11 increases .",
    "this trend can not continue indefinitely ; the curve must turn over for reasons we describe below .    from fig .",
    "[ iso - he4 ] , it is apparent that in the ",
    "large @xmath11 \" range , the required value of @xmath59 decreases with increasing @xmath11 . in our previous analysis",
    "@xcite of he nucleosynthesis which concentrated on @xmath11 in the vicinity of 0.55 , we implicitly assumed that the age of the universe at @xmath60 was not large enough for appreciable amounts of he to have been built up .",
    "this assumption breaks down for large values of @xmath11 _ and _ @xmath31 . since d , 3 and 3",
    "are not present in appreciable quantities , a large value of @xmath31 is needed to boost the he production rate .",
    "now , the larger the value of @xmath11 , the longer neutrons remain in equilibrium , thus allowing more he to be slowly built up , with the neutrons incorporated in he being replaced via @xmath61 reactions . roughly speaking",
    ", the required value of @xmath31 for a given @xmath11 is set by the condition : @xmath62_{t = t_f } \\sim\\;\\ ; 0.24/t(t_f)\\ , .",
    "\\label{req}\\ ] ] the effects of @xmath11 on @xmath63 and @xmath31 on @xmath64 complement each other , giving rise to the trend shown by the he iso - abundance curves in fig .",
    "[ iso - he4 ] for @xmath65 .",
    "+    _ light element abundances in the linear expansion model_. we now turn to the production of deuterium and 3 . for large @xmath11 ( , @xmath23 )",
    ", we expect the deuterium abundance to be insignificant since d can be efficiently burned to 3 during the long time available for nucleosynthesis .",
    "the mean lifetime of deuterium against destructive collisions with protons at a low temperature of 10 kev is around 3 days ; at this temperature the @xmath23 universe is already 300 years old !",
    "the fact that the timescales are so different allows us to derive analytical expressions for the deuterium , helium-3 and lithium-7 ( beryllium-7 ) mass fractions ( to be denoted by @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively ) . the generic equation for the rate of evolution of the mass fraction of nuclide ",
    "@xmath69 \" can be parameterized as @xmath70 where `` prod '' and `` dest '' refer to the production and destruction rates of nuclide `` @xmath69 '' .",
    "given that the universe remains at the same temperature for a very long time ( compared to the reaction time scales ) , it is not surprising that @xmath71 achieves its steady - state value at each temperature ( for a detailed discussion in the context of sbbn , see @xcite ) , @xmath72 we can write this explicitly for the simplest case  deuterium : @xmath73 where the various @xmath74s represent the relevant deuterium creation ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) rates per target proton , and destruction ( @xmath773 and @xmath78 ) rates per target deuterium .",
    "all of these rates can be obtained from ref .",
    "once the reaction rates become smaller than the universal expansion rate ( say at some temperature @xmath79 ) , the abundances freeze out with values close to @xmath71 at the corresponding @xmath79 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ analytic ] which clearly shows that the steady - state solution works very well .",
    "we note here that the steady state ( dotted ) curves in fig .",
    "[ analytic ] are not independent analytic derivations , but use the abundances of the various nuclei as calculated by the numerical code .",
    "the figure intends to emphasize that nucleosynthesis in this ( linear expansion ) model can be well represented by the steady - state solutions in eq .",
    "[ xdx3x7 ] .     +    in the expression for @xmath66 ( see eq .",
    "[ xd ] ) , the @xmath80 reaction term dominates until about 20 kev after which the @xmath81 reaction makes the dominant contribution .",
    "the final deuterium abundance is thus determined by the weak pp reaction ( @xmath76 ) , the effect of which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ alpha1 ] as the very slow rise in @xmath66 between temperatures of 10 kev and 1 kev ( at which point the d abundance freezes out ) .",
    "since both @xmath82he and @xmath83li freeze out much earlier , they do not get any significant boost from the weak pp reaction .    from eq .",
    "[ xd ] , @xmath66 , and thus @xmath67 ( @xmath82he is formed from @xmath84 ) , are proportional to @xmath85 , the neutron abundance .",
    "one striking feature in fig .",
    "[ alpha1 ] is the boost to the neutron abundance ( and hence the abundances of d and @xmath82he ) at temperatures around 40 kev .",
    "the effect is subtle and may be missed in bbn codes with a limited nuclear reaction network .",
    "the slow rate of expansion of the universe during nucleosynthesis facilitates the production of a relatively large  metal \" ( a@xmath86 ) abundance ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath88c is produced in these models through the chain : @xmath89c+p@xmath90 @xmath88n+@xmath91 and the subsequent beta - decay of @xmath88n . in this environment @xmath88c+@xmath51he@xmath92@xmath93o+@xmath94 leads to the production of free neutrons .",
    "the mass-7 abundance is entirely due to the production of @xmath83be through the reaction @xmath82he+@xmath51he@xmath92@xmath83be+@xmath91 .",
    "@xmath83be decays to @xmath83li by electron capture once the universe has cooled sufficiently to permit the formation of atoms . once formed , it is difficult to destroy @xmath83be at temperatures @xmath95 kev .",
    "in contrast , @xmath83li is very easily destroyed , specifically through its interaction with protons .",
    "since the @xmath83be production ( and thus li ) follows the evolution of the @xmath82he abundance , and there is very little destruction of @xmath83be , @xmath83li also benefits from the boost to the neutron abundance described in the last paragraph .",
    "this has the effect of boosting the li abundance from @xmath96 ( if this source of neutrons were not included ) to @xmath97 .",
    "this is significant in that , at the level of a few parts in 10@xmath98 ( ,  @xcite ) , the primordial lithium abundance lies between these two estimates .",
    "+    _ light element abundances vs. @xmath11_. having explored bbn in the linear model ( @xmath99 ) it is now important to ask how these results depend on @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ abund ] that nothing dramatically different happens as @xmath11 changes ; this is simply because the key physics remains the same . in preparing fig .",
    "[ abund ] we adjust the value of @xmath31 ( baryon density ) for each choice of @xmath11 so that the primordial he mass fraction lies between 22% and 26% . as @xmath11 increases , the nuclei freeze out at lower temperatures since the expansion rate at the same temperature is lower for a larger @xmath11 .",
    "the effect of this can be gauged by the behavior of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 with respect to temperature , as given by eq .",
    "[ xdx3x7 ] . for deuterium",
    "this implies a small increase with @xmath11 due to the pp ( weak ) reaction , which is also reflected in the behavior of @xmath82he for @xmath100 .",
    "the fall of @xmath82he with increasing @xmath11 for @xmath101 is due to larger destruction of @xmath82he because of the increase in the time available for the nuclear reactions .",
    "as already mentioned , the abundance of @xmath83be depends critically on the evolution of the @xmath82he abundance ; so while the mass-7 ( @xmath83be ) abundance increases appreciably with the increase in baryon density , it is relatively unaffected by a change in @xmath11 .",
    "note that in those power - law models which can simultaneously reproduce an acceptable he abundance along with a consistent age and expansion rate , the corresponding baryon density must be very large , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ; see fig .  2 ) .",
    "most  if not all  of this range is far too large for consistency with independent ( non - bbn ) estimates of the universal density of baryons ( @xmath104   @xcite ) or , for that matter , the total matter density  @xcite .",
    "conservatively , clusters limit the total ( gravitating ) matter density to @xmath105 so that if there were no non - baryonic dark matter , @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) for @xmath108 . however , if the x - ray emission from clusters is used to estimate the cluster baryon fraction ( see  @xcite ) , the universal baryon density should be smaller than this very conservative estimate by a factor of 7 - 8 ( consistent with the upper bound from the baryon inventory of fukugita , hogan and peebles  @xcite ) .",
    "thus power - law cosmologies constrained to reproduce he ( only ) , an acceptable age and magnitude - redshift relation , and an acceptable baryon density , must have @xmath11 restricted to a very narrow range : @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , the baryon density in even this restricted range is large when compared with estimates  @xcite of the baryon density from cluster x - rays .",
    "finally , for @xmath11 in the narrow range of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , the other light element abundances are restricted to li / h @xmath111 , 3/h @xmath112 , and d / h @xmath113 . for deuterium and helium-3",
    "this is in very strong disagreement ( by 8 to 13 orders of magnitude ! ) with observational data ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "although the predicted @xmath83li abundance is comparable to that observed in the solar system , the local ism , and in stars , it is larger than the primordial abundance inferred from the halo stars  @xcite , and marginally inconsistent with the observations of lithium in the ism of the lmc  @xcite .",
    "in response to the claim  @xcite that a power - law universe expanding linearly with time could be consistent with the constraints on bbn , we have reexamined these models .",
    "although it is true that observationally consistent amounts of he can be produced in these models , this is not the case for the other light elements d , 3 , li .",
    "furthermore , consistency with he at @xmath99 requires a very high baryon density ( @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) , inconsistent with non - bbn estimates of the universal baryon density and , even with the total mass density .",
    "we have also investigated bbn in power - law cosmologies with @xmath116 and have confirmed that although the correct he abundance can be produced , the yields of the other light elements d , 3 , and li are inconsistent with their inferred primordial abundances . in general ,",
    "power - law cosmologies are unable to account simultaneously for the early evolution of the universe ( bbn ) ( which requires @xmath117 ) and for its presently observed expansion ( which requires @xmath118 ) .",
