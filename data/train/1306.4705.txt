    "as fredholm analysis means that one has to control the linear operator @xmath2 modulo compact errors , which in these settings means modulo terms which are _ both _ smoother and more decaying , the underlying linear analysis involves both arguments based on the principal symbol of the wave operator and on its so - called ( b-)normal operator family , which is a holomorphic family @xmath3 of operators - action in the normal variable , and the operator is dilation invariant , this simply means mellin transforming in the normal variable . replacing the normal variable by its logarithm , this is equivalent to a fourier transform . ] on @xmath4 . at the principal symbol level one",

    "in short , we present a _ systematic approach _ to the analysis of semilinear wave and klein - gordon equations : given an appropriate structure of the space at infinity and given that the location of the resonances fits well with the non - linear terms , see the discussion below , one can solve ( suitable ) semilinear equations . in particular , the approach readily generalizes to the analysis of _ quasilinear _ equations , provided one understands the necessary ( b-)analysis in the setting of non - smooth metrics ; see @xcite for such a generalization in the asymptotically de sitter setting .",

    "we reiterate that while the way de sitter , minkowski , etc .",

    "setting it is not clear precisely what improvements are possible for non - linearities with derivatives , though when there are no derivatives in the non - linearity , we already have no restrictions on the non - linearity and to this extent the result is optimal .    on lorentzian scattering spaces",
    "more general function spaces are usedthere are two basic properties of spaces of functions on manifolds with boundaries : differentiability and decay . whether one can have both at the same time for the linear analysis depends on the ( hamiltonian ) dynamical nature of radial points : when defining functions of the corresponding boundaries of the compactified cotangent bundle have opposite character ( stable vs.  unstable ) one can have both at the same time , otherwise not ; see propositions  [ prop : b - saddle ] and [ prop : b - source - sink ] for details . for non - linear purposes , the most convenient setting , in which we are in ( 1 ) , is if one can work with spaces of arbitrarily high regularity and fast decay , and corresponds to saddle points of the flow in the above sense . in ( 4 ) however , working in higher regularity spaces , which is necessary in order to be able to make sense of the non - linearity",
    ", requires using faster growing ( or at least less decaying ) weights , which is problematic when dealing with non - linearities ( e.g. , polynomials ) since multiplication gives even worse growth properties then .",

    "while all results are stated for the scalar equation , analogous results hold in many cases for operators on natural vector bundles , such as the dalembertian ( or klein - gordon operator ) on differential forms , since the linear arguments work in general for operators with scalar principal symbol whose subprincipal symbol satisfies appropriate estimates at radial sets , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "while the basic ingredients of the necessary linear b - analysis were analyzed in @xcite , the solvability framework was only discussed in the dilation invariant setting , and in general the asymptotic expansion results were slightly lossy in terms of derivatives in the non - dilation invariant case .",

    "the key technical tools are the propagation of b - singularities at b - radial points which are saddle points of the flow in @xmath77 , see proposition  [ prop : b - saddle ] , as well as the b - normally hyperbolic versions , proved in @xcite , of the semiclassical normally hyperbolic trapping estimates of wunsch and zworski @xcite ; the rest of the fredholm setup is discussed in section  [ secstaticdesitter - fredholm ] in the non - trapping and section  [ seckds - fredholm ] in the normally hyperbolic trapping setting .",
    "the analogue of proposition  [ prop : b - saddle ] for sources / sinks was already proved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) ; our lorentzian scattering metric fredholm discussion , which relies on this , is in section  [ secminkowski - fredholm ] .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis would be significantly less cumbersome in terms of technicalities if we were not including cauchy hypersurfaces and solved a globally well - behaved problem by imposing sufficiently rapid decay at past infinity instead ( it is standard to convert a cauchy problem into a forward solution problem ) .",
    "cauchy hypersurfaces are only necessary for us if we deal with a problem ill - behaved in the past because complex absorption does not force appropriate forward supports even though it does so at the level of singularities ; otherwise we can work with appropriate ( weighted ) sobolev spaces .",
    "the latter is the case with lorentzian scattering spaces , which thus provide an ideal example for our setting .",
    "it can also be done in the global setting of asymptotically de sitter spaces , as in setting ( 3 ) above , essentially by realizing these as the boundary of the appropriate compactification of a lorentzian scattering space , see @xcite . in the case of kerr - de sitter black holes , in the presence of dilation invariance , one has access to a similar luxury ; complex absorption does the job as in @xcite ; the key aspect is that it needs to be imposed _",
    "outside _ the static region we consider . for a general lorentzian",
    "b - metric with a normally hyperbolic trapped set , this may not be easy to arrange , and we do work by adding cauchy hypersurfaces , even at the cost of the resulting , rather artificial in terms of pde theory , technical complications . for perturbations of kerr - de sitter space , however , it is possible to forego the latter for well - posedness by an appropriate gluing to complete the space with actual kerr - de sitter space in the past for the purposes of functional analysis .",
    "we remark that cauchy hypersurfaces are somewhat ill - behaved for @xmath0 based estimates , which we use , but match @xmath113 estimates quite well , which explains the large role they play in existing hyperbolic theory , such as @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  23.2 ) .",
    "we hope that adopting this more commonly used form of ` truncation ' of hyperbolic problems will aid the readability of the paper .",
    "we also explain the role that the energy estimates ( as opposed to microlocal energy estimates ) play .",
    "these mostly enter to deal with the artificially introduced boundaries ; if other methods were used to truncate the flow , their role reduces to checking that in certain cases , when the microlocal machinery only guarantees fredholm properties of the underlying linear operators , the potential finite dimensional kernel and cokernel are indeed trivial .",

    "the first ingredient is extending the linear theory from that of @xcite in various ways , which is the subject of section  [ secstaticdesitter - fredholm ] . in the following parts of this section we use this extension to solve semilinear equations , and to obtain their asymptotic behavior .",
    "the goal of this section is to fully extend the results of @xcite on linear estimates for wave equations for b - metrics to non - dilation invariant settings , and to explicitly discuss cauchy hypersurfaces since @xcite concentrated on complex absorption .",
    "namely , while the results of @xcite on linear estimates for wave equations for b - metrics are optimally stated when the metrics and thus the corresponding operators are dilation - invariant , i.e.  when near @xmath104 the normal operator can be identified with the operator itself , see ( * ? ? ?",
