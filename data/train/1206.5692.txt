    "the classification ap identifies a ( main sequence ) a or b type star which displays peculiar chemical abundances , usually combined with an observable magnetic field .",
    "although other classes of chemically peculiar stars exist ( e.g. am stars , hg - mn stars , he - weak stars ) , these stars have been demonstrated to lack strong , organised magnetic fields at their surfaces ( e.g. shorlin et al .",
    "2002 , wade et al 2006 , makaganiuk et al . 2011 ) .",
    "ap stars appear to be the only class of middle main - sequence stars for which , in all cases , an observable magnetic field is present ( auririe et al .",
    "2007 ) .    since their discovery by babcock in 1947",
    ", the magnetic fields of ap stars have been established through observation to have important global dipole components with polar strengths ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of gauss .",
    "the symmetry axis of the dipole component is almost always significantly tilted relative the stellar rotation axis .",
    "in addition , ap stars generally spin much more slowly than non - peculiar stars of similar masses ( stepie 2000 ) , and as they spin they exhibit line profile variations attributed to rotational modulation of patchy , non - axisymmetric lateral and vertical distributions of chemical abundance in their photospheres .",
    "the distributions of abundance vary significantly from element to element : some are distributed relatively uniformly , while others show strong contrast ; some are distributed in relatively simple patterns , while others show complex distributions . while it is generally accepted that the fundamental mechanism responsible for the chemical peculiarities is microscopic chemical diffusion ( as described by michaud 1970 ) , the origin of chemical patchiness , and the relationship to the magnetic field , is poorly understood .",
    "the earliest studies of the magnetic field geometries of ap stars interpreted the rotational variations of their longitudinal magnetic fields in the context of stibbs oblique rotator model assuming a simple magnetic dipole field ( e.g. babcock 1947 , 1951 ; stibbs 1950 ) .",
    "however , with the acquisition of increasingly sophisticated diagnostic data ( the mean surface field ( or mean field modulus ) , and high - resolution line profiles ) , it became clear that the large - scale field topologies exhibited important departures from the simple dipolar model ( e.g. preston & sturch 1967 , preston 1969 , 1970 , landstreet 1970 , 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "leroy and collaborators ( landolfi et al .",
    "1993 , leroy et al .",
    "1993 , 1994 , 1995ab , 1996 , bagnulo et al .",
    "1995 , wade et al .",
    "1996 ) systematically studied ap stars using broadband linear polarisation measurements and models , constraining the transverse component of the magnetic field .",
    "importantly , they found that differences between the observed linear polarisation variations and those predicted by the simple dipole model could not be fully explained by abundance inhomogeneities alone ( leroy et al .",
    "1996 ) . with this work , they established a modified dipolar model with a trend toward an outward expansion of the field lines over some parts of the magnetic equator , and showed the potential of linear polarisation for diagnosing small - scale structure of the magnetic fields of ap stars .",
    "thus , the observations and modeling undertaken during the latter half of the 20th century allowed progress from a simple view of the magnetic fields of ap stars to a relatively sophisticated picture in which fields were known to show both global - scale and local - scale departures from a simple dipole .",
    "leroy et al . ( 1996 ) commented that high - resolution spectropolarimetry represented the next step in furthering the study of the magnetic field geometry of ap stars .",
    "four years later , wade et al .",
    "( 2000a ) published the first compendium of phase - resolved high - resolution spectropolarimetric observations of ap stars in both circular and linear polarisation . using the musicos spectropolarimeter",
    ", @xmath8 stokes @xmath0 spectra with a median s / n of 300 ( per 4.6  kms@xmath4  pixel ) were obtained for 14 ap stars . while the quality of the spectra was sufficiently good to show the shape and phase variation of all stokes parameters in mean least - squares deconvolved ( lsd ) line profiles , measurement in individual spectral lines was restricted to a few particularly strong lines , principally those of fe  ii multiplet 42 .",
    "nevertheless , the stokes profiles of 53 cam were used by bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to evaluate published magnetic models developed based on less sophisticated data .",
    "those authors found that models based on so - called `` magnetic observables '' ( e.g bagnulo 2000 ) led to derivation of surface magnetic field characteristics that were not consistent with the detailed stokes profiles , and that both circular and especially linear polarisation profiles were required for realistic reconstruction of the field .",
    "following these conclusions , kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for @xmath9  cvn and lueftinger et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for hd 24712 employed the new magnetic doppler imaging technique ( mdi ) , described by piskunov & kochukhov ( 2002 ) and kochukhov & piskunov ( 2002 ) , to construct high resolution maps of the surface vector magnetic field maps using stokes @xmath10 observations and by preferring a global low - order multipolar field structure .",
    "maps using linear polarisation profiles ( stokes @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) made by kochukhov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) for the ap stars 53 cam and @xmath9  cvn .",
    "these maps were distinguished from earlier models in that they were computed directly from the observed polarised line profiles , making no _ a priori _ assumptions regarding the large - scale or small - scale topology of the field .",
    "the mdi surface magnetic field maps of both stars revealed that their magnetic topologies depart significantly from low - order multipoles .",
    "in particular , both studies concluded that while the global topology of the magnetic field was reasonably smooth , the strength of the field was quite patchy , indicating complex structure on relatively small scales .",
    "simultaneous mapping of the distributions of the surface chemical abundances of several elements was also performed , allowing a comparison between the local field properties and local photospheric chemistry .",
    "it is important to note that the observational material used in the mdi studies of 53 cam and @xmath9 cvn represented the best data sets obtained from several years of musicos observations . in those spectra the uniquely valuable stokes",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 zeeman signatures were only clearly detectable in 3 strong lines , with a significance ( i.e. amplitude divided by error bar ) of 5 or less .",
    "the relatively low signal - to - noise ratio and resolving power achievable with the musicos instrument led to some ambiguity in the field reconstruction , and limited the useful sample of stars to those with bright apparent magnitudes , strong fields and sharp lines . because mdi exploits the indirect resolution of the stellar disc due to stellar rotation , this means that those stars best suited to reconstruction ( relatively rapidly - rotating stars , with consequentially weaker stokes profiles ) were inaccessible to musicos . as a result , only an extremely limited range of stellar properties ( rotation , mass , temperature , magnetic field , etc . ) which may influence the phenomena of interest could be studied using the musicos data .    to address outstanding questions surrounding the detailed magnetic structure of ap stars and the effect of the magnetic field on atmospheric chemical transport processes ,",
    "we have acquired new higher - resolution and signal - to - noise stokes @xmath0 spectra of a small sample of well - studied magnetic ap stars using the new generation of high - resolution spectropolarimeters . in this paper",
    "we describe the observations obtained .",
    "we demonstrate the stability of the instrumentation during the 5 years of observation by evaluating the internal and external agreement of the data .",

    "care also had to be taken with the integration limits when determining both the longitudinal field and net - linear polarization .",
    "when we compared the new longitudinal field measurements with those computed from musicos spectra , immediate agreement was found between the new measurements and those of wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , except in the case of hd 71866 and @xmath9 cvn which showed a slight discrepancy . by re - computing the stokes @xmath5 musicos lsd profiles for these stars with the new masks",
    ", the observations were brought into agreement .",
    "it is possible that if both hd 71866 and @xmath9 cvn have sufficiently peculiar abundances , a general ap star line mask ( with arbitrarily enhanced and depleted abundances of particular elements , as used in the original analysis of wade et al .",
    "2000b ) may result in an underestimation of the longitudinal field .",
    "because each mask used in this study is `` tailor - made '' to the chemical abundances of the respective star , we are less susceptible to this problem and thus measure slightly increased longitudinal field values .",
    "an example of the comparison between the new measurements , and those corresponding to the the two sets of musicos lsd profiles , are shown in section 6.6 ( fig .",
    "27 ) for @xmath9 cvn .",
    "this figure demonstrates that overall the agreement between the new measurements and the re - computed musicos measurements are acceptable .",
    "using the new masks for the other stars makes little difference to the longitudinal field measurements , so the original measurements were kept for comparison . in addition",
    "good agreement can be seen between lsd profiles obtained with musicos and espadons / narval observations .",
    "[ lsdespnavcomp ] shows that lsd profiles both from musicos and the current observations are consistent for an identical phase of observation in the case of hd 32633 and hd 112413 , with the new data showing much reduced noise levels .",
    "it was quickly seen that both the espadons and narval data were consistent with one another .",

    "another test of consistency is described in section 6.2 and 6.6 , where for certain phases , the espadons / narval data for @xmath9 cvn and hd 32633 have been convolved to the same approximate resolution as musicos ( r=35000 ) and then compared to musicos observations of a similar phase .",

    "( 2000b ) , the phenomenon of broadband or net linear polarisation results from differential saturation of @xmath14 and @xmath7 zeeman components of individual spectral lines .",
    "broadband polarisation measurements , such as those reported by leroy ( 1995 ) , effectively average the signal from the net polarised spectral lines with regions of continuum ( which may be unpolarised , or polarised due to e.g. interstellar polarisation ) .",
    "in contrast , net polarisation measurements obtained using lsd measure only the net polarisation in lines . therefore the measurements are not equivalent .",
    "in particular , wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) found that it was necessary to arbitrarily scale and shift the lsd measurements relative to the broadband measurements in order to bring them into agreement .",
    "here we adopt a similar procedure .",
    "table [ curvefit ] also shows the reduced @xmath15 of longitudinal field measurements taken from the null spectra .",
    "a value close to 1 indicates that the null spectra and their error bars are consistent with zero longitudinal field and that the instrument is performing as expected .",
    "we see for hd 4778 , hd 32633 , 49 cam and hd71866 , this is not the case .",
    "these high values are a result of a handful of non - zero null measurements obtained during the december 2006 observations with narval and very small number with obtained espadons , in which the null lsd profiles contained weak signatures ( as discussed in section 3 ) .",
    "in addition , for these stars , we find that the error bars on the stokes @xmath5 longitudinal field measurements are larger than the null longitudinal field error bars , typically by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "this is significant , because it tells us that we begin to see that the stokes @xmath5 longitudinal field measurements are no longer limited by photon noise .",
    "rather , the larger error bars for the longitudinal field in stokes @xmath5 are telling us that the lsd model is failing to fit the @xmath5 spectrum within the libre - esprit computed error bars , likely due to blends and the limitation of the weak - field approximation .",
    "this only happens when a significant number of individual lines show very strong stokes @xmath5 signatures , and ( as demonstrated by our ability to fit the longitudinal field curves within the error bars ) is fully compensated for in the error bar calculation for stokes v. as discussed by wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) this compensation is achieved by scaling the photon noise statistical error bars of lsd profiles by a factor equal to the square root of the reduced @xmath16 .",
    "wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) describes that this scaling is almost always required for stokes",
    "@xmath5 in ap stars .",
    "if we recompute the reduced @xmath15 calculation again for the null spectra , but use the stokes @xmath5 error bars instead of the null error bars , the resulting reduced @xmath15 is consistent with a zero longitudinal field ( for example in the case of hd 32633 , the reduced @xmath15 goes from 5.42 to 0.36 ) .",

    "the goal of this project was to obtain a new data set in all four stokes parameters for a selection of well studied ap stars , with the ultimate aim to map these stars using magnetic doppler imaging .",
    "the target list contained stars which span a large part of the parameter space of interest , with sufficient signal - to - noise ratio to not only greatly improve on the previous observations , but to also be suitable for mdi mapping .",
    "the final selection was based primarily on stars already identified by wade et al .",
    "( 2000a ) as promising candidates for such study .    early on in the project",
    "it was clear that both espadons and narval have greatly improved the level of detail at which ap stars can be studied .",
    "the resulting dataset obtained for this study is far superior to that obtained previously with musicos , and represents some of the highest resolution phase - resolved observations of ap stars acquired to date .",
    "this data set has more individual lines showing variation , much improved signal - to - noise and smaller error bars associated with measurements of the longitudinal field and net linear polarisation .",
    "the new data have been shown to be consistent with the previous observations of wade et al .",
    "( 2000a ) and also those of leroy at al .",
    "( 1995 ) , with most targets agreeing well between the different epochs .",
    "surprisingly we found that even when the data are of such high signal - to - noise and when the magnetic fields are strong , the lsd analysis is sensitive to the normalisation and the measured magnetic field is rather sensitive to the integration ranges chosen , with variations of sometimes on the order of 100 gauss with very small changes of the integration range .",
    "a key conclusion of this work is that even with such high - quality data , extreme care must still be taken with all stages of analysis to ensure consistent results at this level of precision .",
    "although crosstalk was originally a concern , through a series of experiments we have shown that it is at a level which should not have a significant impact on the results . by using observations of @xmath39 equ",
    ", we have seen that the highest level of crosstalk in stokes @xmath11 is still within the noise and slightly above the noise in stokes @xmath12 ( around the 5 % level . ) .",
    "it should be noted that even at these levels , this effect will be less significant in the broader - lined stars studied here .",
    "considering this , we believe the other uncertainties associated with the analysis techniques have a greater effect : normalisation , blending , line masks used for lsd and the choice of integration ranges used for longitudinal field measurements .",
    "but as regards the final impact of the crosstalk on mdi mapping , this will be discussed and addressed in a future paper ( silvester et al . in preparation ) . with these high quality observations ,",
    "we suspect that the limitations for mapping will in fact come not from the data ( with strong stokes @xmath11 and @xmath12 signatures seen in many individual lines ) , but the ability to deal with line blends within the mdi code",
    ".    an important result of this study is the confirmed stability of the global properties of the magnetic fields of these ap stars . over multiple epochs of observations",
    "the fields have remained constant , with little variation in both longitudinal field and linear polarisation measurements . in some cases measurements separated by over a decade still agree with each other within the uncertainties . by comparing mdi maps produced from the new observations of @xmath9 cvn with those of kochukhov and wade ( 2010 ) , we can potentially test for evolution of the field geometry which may occur on small spatial scales .    considering the longitudinal magnetic field measurements ,",
    "agreement was found between the new measurements and those of wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) , with the exception of hd 71866 and @xmath9 cvn which showed a slight discrepancy .",
    "by re - reducing the musicos data with the new masks , the observations were brought into agreement . whilst the general shapes of the netlinear polarisation variations were in agreement ,",
    "one needed to invoke free parameters such as scaling which is consistent with what was described in wade et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .    for any study which requires observations over multiple semesters , it is imperative that the instrument is stable and consistent throughout the campaign .",
    "both narval and espadons proved to be very stable instruments , with resolution and signal - to - noise being constant over the 4 years of data .",
    "indeed we have also shown the two instruments are consistent with one another with close to identical result from similar phases .",
    "these facts demonstrate that espadons and narval are both very capable instruments , well suited to high - resolution four stokes measurements of magnetic stars over multiple year time scales .",
    "one of the targets ( @xmath9 cvn ) has already been mapped with mdi using musicos data by kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) .",
    "hd 112413 is an ideal star for determining how much of an improvement the new polarimetric data could give to mdi mapping .",
    "to quantify this improvement and to further confirm consistency , the new observations of @xmath9 cvn were compared with the profiles predicted by the model of kochukhov & wade ( 2010 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2cvnmapfit ] , good general agreement between the new observations and the musicos - derived model is observed .",
    "however , the new profiles show more complexity than was present in the musicos data , which is not fully reproduced in the current model and would likely require a more complex magnetic field distribution .",
    "in addition , the stokes v profile amplitude is significantly underestimated by the model at a number of phases .    the complete phase coverage of both 49 cam ( silvester et al . in preparation ) , @xmath9 cvn and hd 32633 will allow the completion of 4 stokes parameter mdi maps for these stars , doubling the number of ap stars studied using this technique .",
    "out of the remaining targets hd 4778 , hd 71866 and hd 118022 would also be a worthwhile candidates for mdi ; conversely hd 40312 has small linear polarisation signatures , relative to the noise in their spectra , making them less suitable for mdi analysis .",
    "the mapping of 49 cam is well underway and the results will be presented in paper ii ( silvester et al . in preparation ) .",

    "<S> the observations provide a vastly improved data set compared to previous generations of observations in terms of signal - to - noise ratio , resolving power and measurement uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the longitudinal magnetic field demonstrates that the data are internally consistent within computed uncertainties typically at the 50 to 100@xmath7 level . </S>",
    "<S> data are also shown to be in excellent agreement with published observations and in qualitative agreement with the predictions of published surface structure models . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to providing the foundation for the next generation of surface maps of ap stars , this study establishes the performance and stability of the espadons and narval high - resolution spectropolarimeters during the period 2006 - 2010 .    </S>",
