    "quantum computing hardware is affected by substantial level of intrinsic noise and therefore naturally realizes dissipative quantum dynamics  @xcite .",
    "optimization algorithms , where a configuration of a binary string @xmath1 minimizing a given ( energy or cost ) function @xmath2 is sought for , naturally extract computational advantage from the irreversible dissipative dynamics , and could therefore be readily implemented on a number of existing hardware platforms  @xcite . more specifically , quantum annealing  @xcite ( qa ) is a quantum analog of the widely applied classical simulated annealing algorithm  @xcite ( sa ) , a heuristic solver of np - hard optimization problems  @xcite , with quantum fluctuations playing the role analogous to thermal fluctuations in simulated annealing .",
    "np - hard optimization problems such as finding a ground state spin configuration of a spin glass , are often characterized by an energy landscape with a large number of local minima separated by extensive energy barriers .",
    "dissipative dynamics realized by the open system quantum annealing provides an efficient mechanism for thermalization within domains of attraction of local minima . for efficient search of the configuration space",
    "the barriers separating different domains of attraction have to be overcome which may proceed via thermal excitation or quantum tunneling process .",
    "the performance of the open system quantum annealing algorithm is therefore characterized by a set of relaxation rates associated with such processes , as opposed to , for example , the spectral gaps , as is the case for adiabatic quantum algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the longest relaxation times correspond to the often exponentially slow transitions between local minima separated by extensive potential barriers .",
    "unitary dynamics of a pair of such states corresponds to the switching rate of the order of the matrix element @xmath3 , which in presence of an extensive barrier may scale exponentially with the system size @xmath4 . whereas fast dissipative relaxation within a domain of attraction of a local minima due to the hardware noise introduces a lifetime or level width @xmath5 .",
    "this fast local relaxation strongly suppresses the coherent superposition of the states localized in different local minima when @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , the incoherent quantum tunneling is possible in presence of such strong dissipation where the transition rate is described by the fermi golden rule type expression @xmath7 .",
    "this is the regime likely realized in a large scale quantum annealer  @xcite .",
    "it is an open question whether such incoherent extensive quantum tunneling may provide a more efficient mechanism for searching the configuration space as compared to classical simulated annealing relying on thermal excitation .    _",
    "_    in this paper _",
    "_ , _ _ we analyze the performance of the open system quantum annealing algorithm optimized for the regime of the quantum dissipative dynamics , taking advantage of thermalization and incoherent quantum tunneling .",
    "our goal here is to analyze the contribution of extensive quantum tunneling to the performance of the algorithm .",
    "we consider a model in which there exists a metastable state separated by an extensive barrier from the ground state .",
    "we consider a system of ising spins interacting each with each other with @xmath0body interaction of equal strength , a model often referred to as a @xmath0spin model .",
    "this model allows for a quasiclassical wkb description  @xcite , where the expansion is performed in @xmath8 rather than the more usual @xmath9 , and , at the same time , demonstrates key features characteristic of a range of complex ( np - hard ) optimization problems , such as the 1st order phase transition ( for @xmath10 ) and exponentially small gap between the ground and excited state .",
    "crucially , the metastable state realized in this model is characterized by an exponential degeneracy whereas the ground state is unique .",
    "such entropic imbalance is in fact typical for low energy states in the spin glass phase and it strongly affects the low temperature system dynamics in both quantum and classical cases .",
    "the effect of entropic imbalance is the main focus of our analysis in this paper .",
    "we demonstrate that in presence of such extensive entropy imbalance sa computation time scales exponentially with the system size @xmath11 .",
    "this can be understood intuitively considering the performance of the simulated annealing applied to a model demonstrating a 1st order phase transition into a state characterized by an order parameter .",
    "assume the ordered state to be a ferromagnet for simplicity .",
    "in simulated annealing the system is initialized at infinite temperature , or equal occupation of all classical spin states , then the temperature is gradually lowered to zero .",
    "the simulated spin dynamics is chosen to satisfy the detailed balance condition such that it samples the thermal distribution at a given ( instant ) temperature .",
    "the initial state is a paramagnet , and therefore the solution , the ground state spin configuration at zero temperature , is expected to have high statistical weight only at low enough temperatures below the ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "the exponential degeneracy of the metastable state corresponds to the entropy linear in the system size @xmath11 which significantly lowers the transition temperature .",
    "this can be understood intuitively from the following argument .",
    "we assume a mean field case in which energies of the metastable and ground states as well as the barrier separating them scale linearly with the system size @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we find from equating the free energies @xmath15 , where the entropy imbalance is given by @xmath16 , that the transition occurs at @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , high statistical weight of the ground state is achieved only after equilibration at the low temperature below the phase transition @xmath18 . in presence of the extensive barrier",
    "@xmath14 the relaxation towards the thermal distribution described by the classical krammers escape rate @xmath19 is exponentially slow .",
    "moreover , the entropy gradient along the over - the - barrier escape trajectory gives rise to an additional entropic factor @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the entropy corresponding to the top of the barrier , which appears as an exponential contribution to the prefactor of the krammers rate  @xcite .",
    "therefore the computation time allowing for such relaxation to occur is at least as long the relaxation time @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , a more careful analysis , see appendix  [ sec : simulated - annealing ] , shows that the optimal sa computation time in the presence of the extensive entropy imbalance is given by the smallest of either @xmath23 or the exhaustive search time @xmath24 . at the same time",
    "quantum tunneling amplitude saturates as @xmath25 and may be more efficient than over the barrier escape suggesting that quantum annealing could be more efficient than simulated annealing .",
    "note however that quantum tunneling rate in this mean field model will also scale exponentially with @xmath11 .",
    "therefore the performance of each algorithm will be characterized by a numerical factor in the exponent which have to be carefully compared .",
    "the result is not obvious a priori since we are comparing here different microscopic mechanisms : the quantum dynamics constrained by conservation laws with the classical thermal excitation process constrained by the entropy imbalance and the low temperature .    considering the open system quantum annealing applied to the @xmath26-spin model",
    "we show that the scaling of the optimal qa computation time ( allowing for repeated runs of the algorithm ) is determined by the quantum tunneling amplitude at a single point in the algorithm , the so called freezing point , after which quantum / thermal fluctuations are weak and the transitions over or through the barrier are no longer likely .",
    "we find that due to the effect of the entropy associated with the metastable state the optimal quantum tunneling rate is achieved at vanishing temperature , i.e. raising temperature may reduce the quantum tunneling rate .",
    "this is in contrast with the usual intuition about a quantum mechanical particle trapped in a non - degenerate metastable potential well where the escape rate monotonously increases with temperature .",
    "the optimal qa regime therefore also corresponds to the vanishing temperature . comparing the optimal computation time of qa obtained in this regime with that of sa for a range of the potential barrier shapes we find that qa could outperform sa under certain circumstances , thus providing a polynomial ( rather than exponential ) speedup .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we consider @xmath11 ising spins @xmath27 on a fully connected graph ( i.e. each spin interacts with each other spin ) with uniform interaction strength such that the system is fully described in terms of the total spin projection operator @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a set of spin@xmath31 operators .",
    "we consider a hamiltonian ,    @xmath32    consisting of a uniform transverse field term , the second term above , and a potential energy of interaction @xmath2 , which is assumed to be a function of the @xmath33projection operator .",

    "therefore a classical model algorithm such as `` spin - vector '' monte carlo method  @xcite , which could follow the deformation of the effective quasiclassical potential imitating the course of qa , is also not expected to encounter a bottleneck requiring exponential computation time . whereas in the case of @xmath39",
