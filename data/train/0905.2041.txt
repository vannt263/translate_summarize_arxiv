    "the cosmic microwave background that we observe today is almost homogenous and isotropic .",
    "the background temperature in our sky is about @xmath0k with a tiny fluctuation at a level of about @xmath1k .",
    "this is consistent with measurements of the matter content of the universe , altogether prevailing a spatially flat universe .",
    "inflation scenario can explain the homogeneity , the isotropy , and the flatness of the present universe .",
    "moreover , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field during inflation can give rise to primordial density fluctuations with a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum which is consistent with the recent wmap data on cosmic microwave background anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a general assumption usually made in most cosmological models is that the background metric is homogenous and isotropic .",
    "for example , a de sitter metric is used in the inflationary era and a flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric is used in the subsequent hot big bang .",
    "an interesting notion is the recent discovery of a dominant component in the matter content , dubbed the dark energy , which exerts a negative pressure to drive an accelerated expansion of the universe . if dark energy is a form of vacuum energy , our universe will coast to the de sitter space - time or the inflating phase again in the future .",
    "apparently our present universe is not so homogeneous and isotropic because we observe local non - linear structures such as stars , galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and very massive black holes .",
    "an appropriate space - time , for example , for a massive black hole sitting in the accelerating universe , would be described by the schwarzschild metric in the vicinity of the black hole and by the de sitter metric at places far from the black hole . presently , these local structures are decoupled from the hubble flow , so it suffices to use the friedmann - robertson - walker metric to study the large scale structures of the universe . however , in the early universe the gravitational effect of a black hole to the background metric may be important and should be addressed .",
    "for example , the existence of a black hole or a distribution of black holes at the onset of inflation can invalidate the use of a homogenous and isotropic background metric for the calculation of de sitter quantum fluctuations .",
    "this also applies to the situation when we are very near to one of these black holes that still exists today or not .",
    "the cosmic no hair conjecture infers that the inflationary universe approaches asymptotically the de sitter space - time till the end of inflation  @xcite . nevertheless , the effects of matter and space - time inhomogeneities to inflation should be considered .",
    "several authors have studied the onset of inflation under inhomogeneous initial conditions to determine whether large inhomogeneity during the very early universe can prevent the universe from entering an inflationary era  @xcite .",
    "it was found that in some cases a large initial inhomogeneity may suppress the onset of inflation  @xcite .",
    "if the inflaton field is sufficiently inhomogeneous , the wormhole can form before the inhomogeneity is damped by the exponential expansion  @xcite . in the case of inhomogeneities in a dust era before inflation , some inhomogeneities can collapse into a black - hole space - time  @xcite . furthermore , for the inhomogeneities of the space - time itself",
    ", energies in the form of gravitational waves can also form a black - hole space - time  @xcite . as a consequence , at the onset of inflation",
    ", the distortion of the metric by these inhomogeneities should be taken into account .",
    "with these considerations in mind , in this work we will investigate the quantum fluctuations of a free massless scalar field in the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) space - time . in the static coordinate system ,",
    "the line element of the sds space - time is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the mass of the black hole , and @xmath5 is the hubble parameter for inflation .",
    "here we use the convention with @xmath6 .",
    "as is well - known , the sds metric has a black hole horizon and a cosmological horizon . in the static coordinates  ( [ static ] )",
    "an observer can only receive a signal inside or just right on the cosmological horizon .",
    "this static metric is insufficient for our purpose because in the cosmological setting we aim at studying the temporal evolution of a fourier mode of the scalar quantum fluctuations that crosses the cosmological horizon during inflation .",
    "therefore , we will instead use the planar coordinates for the sds metric  @xcite , which is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conformal time and @xmath9 . in eq .",
    "( [ planar ] ) , the @xmath10 and @xmath11 functions are given by @xmath12 ^ 2 \\left[1+\\frac{gm}{2a(\\tau)r}\\right]^{-2},\\quad h(r,\\tau)=a^{2}(\\tau)\\left[1+\\frac{gm}{2a(\\tau)r}\\right]^{4},\\ ] ] with the cosmic scale factor @xmath13 .",
    "note that at large times the planar coordinates behave like a de sitter expansion .",
    "also , we can cast it to a co - moving frame that is conformal to the minkowskian space - time with a black hole in it .",
    "it is well - known that a black hole evaporates into hawking radiation which leads to a mass loss of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance  @xcite . for a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath4 , the evaporation time is given by @xmath14",
    "therefore , our present consideration requires the condition that the evaporation time scale of the black hole is longer than the time scale of inflation , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "this gives the lower bound on the mass of the black hole for a given inflation scale : @xmath16    in the next section , we will review the scalar quantum fluctuations in the de sitter metric .",
    "then , we will introduce a perturbation method to expand the planar metric in powers of the black hole mass @xmath4 to find an approximate solution of the scalar equation .",
    "section  [ numerical ] contains the numerical results of the first - order solutions .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] is our conclusion .",

    "we have also calculated @xmath119 for larger values of @xmath122 , which becomes fluctuating but in general the value of the amplitude is getting smaller .",
    "it is expected because the farther the black hole is , the lesser is its effect to the perturbation .",
    "we have presented a perturbation method to compute the effect of the presence of a black hole in the de sitter space to the quantum fluctuations of a free massless scalar field .",
    "the method is valid as long as the expansion parameter @xmath123 , i.e. , the product of the mass of the black hole and the de sitter hubble parameter has to be smaller than the planck mass squared .",

    "the first - order contribution is computed and the results are given in the assumption that the black hole is located at the origin of the coordinates .",
    "higher - order corrections can be worked out perturbatively though complicated .",

    "then , the wavelength of the fourier mode with @xmath125 is about the size of the present universe . if the location of the black hole that exists during inflation is near the earth , the suppressed power of the first - order correction to the de sitter inflaton fluctuations in low @xmath74 and low @xmath73 regions may result in a blue - tilted density power spectrum on large angular scales .",
    "this in turn gives rise to a suppression of the large - scale cosmic microwave background anisotropy that may be relevant to the observed low quadrupole in the wmap cosmic microwave background anisotropy data  @xcite .",
    "a detailed calculation of the effect to the cosmic microwave background anisotropy is underway , including the case that the black hole locates somewhere else in the universe .",
    "if inflation lasts for a longer time , then the wavelength of the fourier mode that corresponds to the size of the present universe will be given by a larger value of @xmath121 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we plot the asymptotic values @xmath115 against @xmath74 for @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 , which correspond to the inflation with @xmath124 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 e - folds , respectively . as expected , the longer is the inflation duration the lesser pronounced are the effects of the black hole to large - scale or low-@xmath74 observations .",

    "[ fig3 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the present work gives a realization of the general discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite about the potentially observable effects of a small violation of translational invariance during inflation , as characterized by the presence of a preferred point , line , or plane .",
