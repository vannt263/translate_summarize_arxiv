    "<S> it is not possible to get reasonable agreement with radiative decay data without including counterterms . since nrqcd is the microscopic theory of charmonia , and does not include loop effects from charmonia , one is tempted to identify the result of a calculation of the @xmath0 amplitude in nrqcd with the tree level coupling in hh@xmath3pt </S>",

    "<S> the first factor comes from the loop integration factor , the second from the propagators , the third factor from the derivative couplings of charmonium to @xmath26 mesons , and the factor of @xmath103 is the photon or pion momentum which comes from the coupling of these particles to @xmath26 mesons . the diagrams with the contact interaction scale as @xmath128 which is the same as the triangle graph . </S>",
    "<S> this is because there is no derivative in the contact interaction with the photon , the derivative in the charmonium @xmath26 meson coupling must turn into the factor of @xmath103 required by gauge invariance or chiral symmetry and there are only two propagators . </S>",

    "<S> one can formally modify the power counting counting in the following way . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse propagator for a non - relativistic meson can be written as @xmath129 , where the residual mass term in the propagator has been split into a term @xmath52 which is common to all @xmath26 meson states and a term @xmath130 contains @xmath13 breaking and hyperfine splittings that are different for different @xmath26 mesons . </S>",

    "<S> a non - vanishing result at least one propagator in the graph must give a contribution from the second term , then the power counting says the graph is enhanced by a factor of @xmath132 , which makes the graph @xmath31 enhanced rather than @xmath39 suppressed relative to the tree level diagrams  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath39 is not very small this could be compensated by other numerical factors . in practice </S>",
    "<S> it is easier to simply calculate the graphs with the unexpanded propagators but expanding the propagator makes it clear that after summing over all graphs one gets a @xmath31 enhancement . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will take the viewpoint that the leading one loop diagrams are of roughly the same size as the tree level contributions and include both in the decays , then try to simultaneously fit the radiative and hadronic decays mentioned above .    </S>",
    "<S> a separate question is whether higher order chiral corrections are under control . </S>",
    "<S> certainly some chiral corrections are suppressed as argued for different charmonium radiative decays in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but in a subgraph with a ladders of single pion exchanges between a pair of @xmath26 mesons , non - relativistic power counting shows that the ladder with @xmath133 single pion exchanges is suppressed relative to one with @xmath134 pion exchanges by a factor @xmath135 @xcite where @xmath136 is the relative momentum of the @xmath26 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> this would require @xmath137 with @xmath138 to be less than @xmath139 . </S>",
    "<S> in some channels a resummation of single pion exchanges may be needed to do accurate calculations . </S>",
    "<S> such a resummation is beyond the scope of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> here we are simply interested in the impact that including the tree level interactions and simultaneously fitting the radiative and hadronic decays has on the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and therefore the size of @xmath26 meson loop contributions to charmonium decays .    to constrain the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we determine the parameter @xmath62 and the product @xmath6 from the measured rates for @xmath140 $ ] and @xmath141 $ ] . because the predictions for the decay rates are quadratic in @xmath6 , this does not completely determine @xmath6 , but yields two possible solutions . </S>",
