    "the radon transform @xcite is a key mathematical tool in tomography .",
    "its inverse enables one to reconstruct a function if some of its integrals are known .",
    "the whole subject has been recently revived by quantum mechanical applications .",
    "the possibility of reconstructing the tomographic map of the wigner quasidistribution function @xcite associated with a given quantum state @xcite has motivated experiments @xcite , triggered novel proposals @xcite and boosted innovative theoretical techniques @xcite .",
    "applications are widespread and diverse .",
    "the entire field , driven by a blizzard of technical advances , is attracting increasing attention and is growing at a lively pace .",
    "good reviews on the subject can be found in @xcite .",
    "the radon transform was originally introduced as an integral transform defined over submanifolds of @xmath0 , that may be viewed as a  configuration space .",
    "\" however , if @xmath1 is even , one may think of @xmath0 as a phase space and consider the integrals over its lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "one may then associate the tomographic map with the symplectic transform on the phase space @xcite . in this",
    "context , motion is instrumental for the identification of the phase space and its lagrangian variables : the hamilton equations do not appear in the definition of the radon transform and this interpretation differs from the original one . nevertheless , the approach is prolific and enables one to identify different types of tomograms @xcite , extend tomography to curved surfaces @xcite and consider more general problems and applications .",
    "this is in line with previous hystorical developments , by radon himself @xcite , john @xcite , helgason @xcite and strichartz @xcite , and paves the way towards so far unhearted quantum mechanical applications .    in this article",
    "we shall compare the standard radon approach with that based on the afore - mentioned symplectic identification .",
    "we shall argue that , although mathematically equivalent , they may differ in practice .",
    "in particular , the inversion may be far from trivial and may turn out to be simpler in the symplectic framework .",
    "let us focus on the 2-dimensional case for the sake of concreteness .",
    "the radon transform , in its original formulation , solves the following problem : reconstruct a function of two variables , say @xmath2 , if its integrals over arbitrary lines are given .",
    "the radon transform ( or homodyne tomogram ) reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dirac function , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( the unit sphere in 1d ) and @xmath7 . in order to obtain a symplectic formulation ,",
    "a central observation is the following : it is possible to express the radon transform in affine language ( the so - called tomographic map ) @xcite and write @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "we have named ",
    "@xmath11 \" the tomographic map ( [ eq : fm2expl ] ) after manko and marmo , who gave seminal contribution towards its significance @xcite .",
    "clearly @xmath12 consider now a particle moving on the line @xmath13 and a function @xmath14 on its phase space @xmath15 .",
    "since @xmath16 the argument in the dirac delta function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fm2expl ] ) may be considered either as a euclidean product or as a symplectic product .",
    "the two interpretations are completely equivalent and one can equivalently solve the inversion problem by using the euclidean or symplectic fourier transform .",
    "we shall see in the next section that the two procedures can vastly differ in complexity .",
    "note that the radon transform is defined in an equivalent way by @xmath17 the inversion formula , as given by radon , amounts to consider first the average value of @xmath18 on all lines tangent to the circle of center @xmath19 and radius @xmath20 , namely , @xmath21 and then compute @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "the radon transform maps a ( suitable ) function on the plane into a function on the cylinder .",
    "some conditions that guarantee the invertibility and continuity of the map were studied by radon himself @xcite , john @xcite , helgason @xcite and strichartz @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the inverse transform of ( [ eq : fm2expl ] ) reads @xcite @xmath24",
    "we now compare the inversions ( [ eq : circlemean])-([eq : randoninversion ] ) and ( [ eq : invgen ] ) by looking at a very simple example : the ground state of a one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath25 its @xmath11-transform reads @xmath26}\\ ; dp \\nonumber\\\\                     & = & \\frac{\\alpha^2}{|\\mu|\\pi}\\int_{{\\mathbb{r } } } e^{-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\mu^2}\\left [                     \\left ( \\sqrt{\\mu^2+\\nu^2}p-\\frac{\\nu x}{\\sqrt{\\mu^2+\\nu^2}}\\right)^2 + \\frac{\\mu^2x^2}{\\mu^2+x^2 }                     \\right]}\\ ; dp \\nonumber\\\\                     & = &                     \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\pi(\\mu^2+\\nu^2)}}e^{-\\alpha^2                     \\frac{x^2}{\\mu^2+\\nu^2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is a gaussian with respect to @xmath27 , but has a nontrivial dependence on @xmath28 and @xmath29 . on the other hand , by making use of ( [ eq : ff2 ] ) , one gets the radon transform @xmath30 which is simply a gaussian , independent of the angle @xmath31 , due to symmetry .",
    "let us tackle the inversion problem .",
    "we start from the inverse @xmath11 transform , which is easily solved in a few lines : @xmath32    let us now endeavour to invert the radon transform .",
    "it would be tempting to leave this as an exercise for the reader , but we will sketch the main steps of the derivation . from ( [ eq : circlemean ] ) we get @xmath33 and thus @xmath34 , where @xmath35 already in the very simple case of a gaussian function with a gaussian radon transform the above inversion formula is not easy to manage .",
    "first introduce a step function , @xmath36 only if @xmath37 , and change the period of the angle integration @xmath38 then change variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 now look at the region where the argument of the theta function is positive .",
    "one gets two roots @xmath42 whose discriminant is negative for @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 let us evaluate @xmath47 .",
    "the integration over @xmath48 yields @xmath49 and thus @xmath50 an integration by part gives @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "since the gaussian integral equals @xmath53 , we finally get @xmath54 therefore , it remains to prove that @xmath55 vanishes for @xmath56 .",
    "we will leave it as a very instructive exercise .",
    "notice that the radon transform can also be inverted by using the following alternative formula due to helgason @xcite , which is suitable for generalizations to symmetric homogeneous spaces @xmath57 here the fractional laplacian @xmath58 is defined by a fourier transform @xmath59 where @xmath60 in our case we would have to compute @xmath61 a task even more difficult than the previous one .",
    "the definitions and conclusions of the previous sections can be easily extended to @xmath1 dimensions .",
    "the radon transform of a function @xmath62 of the @xmath1-dimensional vector @xmath63 reads @xmath64 where @xmath65 , the @xmath66-dimensional sphere , @xmath67 denotes scalar product and @xmath68 .",
    "the @xmath11 transform is @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath7 .",
    "obviously , from @xmath71 one can immediately recover @xmath72 by setting @xmath73 : @xmath74 however , notice that , although @xmath18 is the restriction of @xmath75 on the unit sphere @xmath76 , there is actually a bijection between the two transforms .",
    "therefore , they carry exactly the same information . indeed , since the dirac distribution is positive homogeneous of degree @xmath77 , i.e.  @xmath78 ) @xmath79 for @xmath80 . in words , the tomogram @xmath71 at a generic point @xmath70 is completely determined by the tomogram at @xmath81 . but the latter is nothing but the radon transform , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff0 ] )",
    ". therefore we get the bijection @xmath82 notice also that at the origin @xmath83 the @xmath11 transform @xmath84 depends only on the total mass .",
    "the inversion formulae for the transforms ( [ eq : fsharp ] ) and ( [ eq : fm2 ] ) read @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . while formula ( [ eq : geninvsym ] ) , which is nothing but a fourier transform , is quite easy to handle",
    ", the inversion formula ( [ eq : geninvrad ] ) is in general very hard to tackle , especially for even @xmath1 , due to the presence of a fractional laplacian .",
    "therefore , from a practical point of view our message is the following : in order to invert the radon transform ( [ eq : ff0 ] ) , dilate it by ( [ eq : ff33 ] ) into the @xmath11 transform and then use the fourier inversion formula ( [ eq : geninvsym ] ) .",
    "this simple trick enables one to avoid long and tedious calculations .",
    "this work was partially supported by the eu through the integrated project eurosqip .",
    "we thank v. manko and g. marmo for many discussions on the meaning of the radon transform and g. florio for a bright suggestion .",
