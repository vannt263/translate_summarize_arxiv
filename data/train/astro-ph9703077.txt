    "monopoles connected by strings can be formed in a sequence of symmetry breaking phase transitions in the early universe @xcite .",
    "a typical sequence of this sort is ghu(1)hz_n .[symbreak ] for a semi - simple group @xmath10 , the first of these phase transitions gives rise to monopoles , and at the second phase transition each monopole gets attached to @xmath11 strings . for @xmath12 , a single infinite network is formed which permeates the entire universe @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fluxes of monopoles in the network are channelled into the strings that connect them .",
    "but the monopoles typically have additional , unconfined magnetic charges .",
    "the gauge fields associated with these charges may include electromagnetic or gluon fields , but may also correspond to broken gauge symmetries and have non - zero masses .",
    "the cosmological evolution of monopole - string networks has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was argued that the networks evolve in a self - similar manner , with a characteristic scale growing proportionally to cosmic time @xmath13 .",
    "the typical energy of the monopoles also grows like @xmath13 , and the monopoles become highly relativistic .",
    "radiation of gauge quanta by accelerating monopoles is the main energy loss mechanism of the networks .",
    "relativistic particles emitted by the monopoles ( or the decay products of these particles ) contribute to the spectrum of high - energy cosmic rays .    for the symmetry breaking sequence ghu(1)h,[symbreak1 ] which can be regarded as a special case of ( [ symbreak ] ) with @xmath14 , the cosmological evolution is quite different . in this case , each monopole is attached to a single string , and the second phase transition results in monopole - antimonopole ( mm ) pairs connected by strings .",
    "if both of the phase transitions in ( [ symbreak1 ] ) occur during the radiation era , then the average monopole separation is always smaller than the hubble radius , and when mm pairs get connected by strings and begin oscillating , they typically dissipate the bulk of their energy to friction in less than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "a more interesting possibility arises in the context of inflationary scenario , when monopoles are formed during inflation but are not completely inflated away .",
    "strings can either be formed later during inflation , or in the post - inflationary epoch . in this case",
    ", the strings connecting mm pairs can be very long .",
    "the correlation length of strings , @xmath15 , can initially be much smaller than the average monopole separation , @xmath16 ; then the strings connecting monopoles have brownian shapes .",
    "but in the course of the evolution , @xmath15 grows faster than @xmath16 , due to small loop production , and to the damping force acting on the strings .",
    "eventually , @xmath15 becomes comparable to the monopole separation , and we are left with @xmath17 pairs connected by more or less straight strings . at later times , the pairs oscillate and gradually lose their energy by gravitational radiation and by radiation of light gauge bosons ( if the monopoles have unconfined magnetic charges ) .",
    "when the energy of a string connecting a pair is dissipated , the monopoles and antimonopoles annihilate into relativistic particles .",
    "although monopole - antimonopole pairs connected by strings do not typically survive until the present time , they can produce a characteristic feature in the spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this feature depends in particular on the intensity of the gauge boson radiation , which determines the lifetime of the pairs .",
    "the production of high energy particles by topological defects is interesting as a mechanism of emission of ultrahigh energy particles , in particular photons , nucleons and neutrinos .",
    "the energies of such particles can be much higher than have been observed until now .",

    "antimonopole pair .",
    "if the magnetic charge of the monopoles is of electromagnetic nature , then the radiation can be treated in the same way as that of an accelerating charge , and our problem reduces to a problem in classical electrodynamics . in the case of a chromomagnetic charge ,",
    "the picture is more complicated .",
    "the monopoles emit heavy virtual gluons which originate a parton cascade .",
    "the hadrons are produced in the usual way beyond the confinement radius .",
    "the decay of pions results in high energy neutrino radiation .",
    "the heavy gauge bosons , such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , can also be produced for some range of parameters of the mm pair and the string .",
    "the problem studied here is in fact a general theoretical problem : the radiation of heavy particles by an accelerating monopole .",
    "our results can be reformulated in terms of the basic parameters of a shock problem , the proper acceleration of the monopole .",
    "the dynamics of mm pairs connected by strings is rather complicated and has not been studied in any detail in the litterature .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the simplest case of an oscillating pair connected by a straight string , for which the equations of motion can be solved exactly .",
    "in addition , we shall consider the case of a harmonic oscillator motion of the monopoles which has some of the features expected in more general monopole - string configurations .",
    "taken together , the analyses of these two cases will allow us to draw a reasonably complete picture of the radiation spectrum in the general case .",
    "after reviewing the general formalism for gauge boson radiation in the next section , we calculate the radiation spectrum of massless gauge bosons in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "radiation of massive gauge bosons is analysed in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the spectrum of hadrons resulting from radiation of gluons and their subsequent fragmentation are discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",

    "the value @xmath169 determines the qcd coupling constant in the one - loop approximation as @xmath170 , where @xmath64 is the number of guark flavors unfrozen at a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "numerically , @xmath171 .",
    "note that the fragmentation function ( [ frag ] ) differs significantly from the function introduced by hill @xcite which was subsequently used in much of the literature on cosmic rays from topological defects .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath172 has a maximum at x = x_m = x_0(-_0/2 ) .",
    "the origin of this maximum is related to the effect of coherent radiation of soft gluons by a jet of partons @xcite,@xcite . at small @xmath165",
    "the size of emitted gluons is larger than the width of the parton beam .",
    "a jet therefore radiates soft gluons as a single source with a color charge equal to the algebraic sum of the color charges of partons in the beam .    for ultrarelativistic monopoles , the approximation ( [ specap ] ) for the spectrum of massless gauge bosons",
    "can be used instead of the exact spectrum .",
    "then , the integration in eq .",
    "( [ hadspec ] ) for the hadron spectrum can be performed and we obtain , for @xmath173 , n_h ( e_h)= f_h , [ hadrspec ] where we have introduced the auxiliary function ( x ) & = & _ x^+ ^-t^2dt .we obviously have @xmath174 , while the low energy asymptotic behavior of the spectrum is : n_h(e ) f_h . [ lowhadr ] a numerical example for the hadron ( nucleon ) spectrum , which corresponds to @xmath175 and @xmath176 is shown in figure [ hadrspec10 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath167 can be taken as 0.1 , which is roughly valid for nucleons .",
    "the shape of the spectrum depends only on the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "we have analyzed the radiation of massless and massive gauge bosons by accelerating monopoles . in the massless case , we calculated the radiation spectrum for an oscillating @xmath177 pair connected by a straight string and for a monopole undergoing a harmonic oscillator motion . combining this with the standard analysis of the synchrotron radiation , we arrive at the following qualitative picture .    for a monopole of magnetic charge @xmath56 moving with a proper acceleration @xmath4 ,",
    "the total radiated power is @xmath178 . in our case , @xmath179 , where @xmath28 is the string tension and @xmath29 is the monopole mass . in the instantaneous rest frame of the monopole ,",

    "is strongly suppressed , while for @xmath182 the spectrum is somewhat dependent on the type of motion ( for example , the spectrum is flat for a harmonic oscillator and has a maximum at @xmath183 for a circular motion ) .",
    "the same picture applies in the case of massive gauge bosons , as long as their mass is sufficiently small , @xmath184 . in the opposite limit of large mass , @xmath7 ,",
    "the radiation power is exponentially suppressed [ see eq.([eq : powtot ] ) ] , and gauge quanta are emitted with a characteristic energy @xmath185 in a narrow range @xmath9 . the interesting case for practical applications is the production of hadrons by an accelerating monopole .",
    "it effectively occurs through radiation of gluons due to the chromodynamic charge of the monopole . as in the general case of heavy quanta , the radiation of gluons with virtualities @xmath186 is exponentially suppressed and therefore most gluons are produced with @xmath187 , where the massless limit is approximately valid . beyond the confinement radius , high - energy gluons fragment into hadrons ; the corresponding fragmentation function is given by eq.([frag ] ) .",
    "the obtained formulae for radiation of accelerating monopole can be straightforwadly generalized to any other accelerating particle .    in a monopole - string network , with @xmath11 strings attached to each monopole , the proper acceleration of a monopole is determined by the vector sum of the tension forces exerted by the strings . by order of magnitude",
    "it is still given by @xmath188 .",
    "the cosmological evolution of monopole - string networks is expected to be characterized by a single length scale , ( t)~t , [ xi ] where @xmath189 and @xmath13 is the cosmic time .",
    "this scale gives the average distance between monopoles and the average length of string segments .",
    "the typical energy of a monopole is e_m~~t .",
    "[ emt ] the corresponding lorentz factor is @xmath190 , and from eq.([bare ] ) the typical energy of quanta emitted at time @xmath13 is ~(^2/m^2)t .",
    "[ et ]    assuming that radiation of gauge quanta is the dominant energy loss mechanism of the networks , one finds @xcite that the parameter @xmath191 is given by ~/m^2 , [ kappa ] where @xmath192 and @xmath193 is the gauge coupling .",
    "networks can also lose energy by production of closed loops of string and of small nets .",
    "the effect of these mechanisms is hard to estimate without numerical simulations of the network dynamics . for the time being , eq.([kappa ] ) should be regarded as a lower bound on @xmath191 , the upper bound being due to causality , @xmath194 .",
    "hence , /m^2 1 .",
    "[ kappa ]    it is clear from eqs.([emt]),(([et ] ) that the energies of monopoles themselves and of the quanta they emit can get arbitrarily large at sufficiently late times .",
    "in particular , the emitted particles can have super - planckian energies , @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is the planck mass . to give a quantitative estimate",
    ", we note that the string tension @xmath28 and the monopole mass @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of the corresponding symmetry breaking scales as @xmath197 , @xmath198 .",
    "these scales are expected to satisfy _ ew _",
    "s<_m < m_p , where @xmath199 is the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "it follows from eqs.([et]),([kappa ] ) that at the present time /m_p",
    "10 ^ 56(_s^6/_m^4m_p^2 ) , and thus the emitted particles are super - planckian provided that _",
    "m_p10 ^ -28 .",
    "this covers a wide range of parameter values .",
    "for example , one could have gut - scale monopoles , @xmath200 , and intermediate - scale strings , @xmath201 , or electroweak - scale strings and light monopoles with @xmath202 .",
    "the interaction of super - planckian particles with the microwave background and with cosmic magnetic fields , the resulting cosmic ray fluxes , and some other defect models that can give rise to such particles will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "conventional astrophysical acceleration mechanisms are not capable to account for particles of such tremendous energy , and if they are ever observed , it appears that topological defects would be the only possible explanation .",
