    "entanglement is a pervasive phenomenon in quantum physics , and has been studied extensively in finite - dimensional systems using the tools of quantum information theory . more elusive",
    "is the entanglement structure of infinite - dimensional systems , namely quantum field theories .",
    "the last twenty years has seen the development of a large literature on the entanglement entropy of qft s and has shed light on the entanglement between spatial degrees of freedom @xcite . currently , there are only a few classes of field theories for which entanglement entropy can be computed exactly . these include certain exactly solvable qft s , free field theories , and conformal field theories .",
    "cft s with holographic duals are particularly interesting because their entanglement entropies can be computed using the ryu - takayanagi formula @xcite .",
    "despite this vast body of work , the entanglement entropy of qft s remains rather mysterious .",
    "entanglement entropies for qft s typically contain a combination of divergent and finite terms which depend on the parameters of the qft",
    ". often it can be difficult to gain insight into the entanglement structure of a qft by analyzing the form of its entanglement entropy .",
    "more insightful is how the entanglement entropy",
    "_ changes _ as a qft undergoes dynamics such as a quench , or as parameters of the qft are tuned .    conspicuously missing from the list of qft s with exactly computable entanglement entropies are those interacting field theories which comprise the standard model . even conventional qft s such as @xmath0 theory and yukawa theory",
    "have not had much presence in the entanglement entropy literature . while it may not be possible to study the exact entanglement entropy of these theories , it is possible to study perturbative or variational approximations .    in this paper",
    "we embark on a program to analyze the entanglement entropies of more conventional interacting qft s , and begin with interacting scalar field theories and @xmath0 theory in particular .",
    "our plan of attack is to use a variational principle to determine a non - perturbative approximation to the ground state of @xmath0 theory for arbitrary coupling , and then compute the entanglement entropy of the approximation .",
    "our variational ansatz will be a gaussian wave functional , for which we can compute the entanglement entropy exactly .",
    "since the ground state of a massive free scalar field theory is exactly a gaussian wave functional , our approximation will be accurate in a neighborhood of zero coupling .",
    "we will also analyze the variational approximation at larger values of the coupling , for which the variational method is well - defined .",
    "the validity and accuracy of the gaussian variational approximation compares favorably to one - loop computations and large n approximations for theories where such comparisons make sense .",
    "our consideration of the approximation at larger values of the coupling will augment our understanding of the small coupling case , and provide evidence for features of entanglement entropy that may hold for all values of the coupling .",
    "once we have computed the variational approximation to the entanglement entropy in @xmath0 theory , we will analyze how it changes as we tune the coupling .",
    "we will find that the derivatives of entanglement entropy with respect to coupling are often finite and independent of regularization , and represent meaningful physical quantities . by studying the dependence of entanglement entropy on the coupling",
    ", we find several surprising features which suggest new insights into the nature of entanglement in qft s .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : first we discuss the variational methods used to approximate the ground state and other more general states of @xmath0 theory .",
    "then we explain how to compute the entanglement entropy of the variational ansatz using the replica trick .",
    "finally , we analyze the dependence of the entanglement entropy on the coupling in various dimensions for @xmath0 theory within the variational approximation .",
    "in this section we introduce and review the essential aspects of the variational methods we will use for the approximate calculations of entanglement entropy in interacting quantum field theories .",
    "the framework of variational methods that employ a gaussian trial wave functional in the computation of the effective action and effective potential ( in particular the 2pi effective action ; see cornwall , jackiw , and tomboulis @xcite ) is referred to as the _ gaussian effective potential _ , or gep .",
    "the gep for @xmath0 theory , as well as for other quantum field theories , has been studied extensively by stevenson and his collaborators @xcite beginning in the 1980s . that work built on earlier work of barnes and ghandour @xcite and others in the 1970s , which in turn extended and clarified the pioneering work of schiff @xcite in the early 1960s .",
    "we will trace the development of the gep and the closely related gap equation along a slightly different route , using a special case of a time - dependent variational principle based on work of kerman and koonin @xcite , and applied to quantum field theory by jackiw , kerman , and others @xcite . in considering the special case of a static uniform system ,",
    "our results reproduce those of stevenson et al . for scalar @xmath0 theories .",
    "we will use the schrdinger picture description of quantum field theory ( see jackiw @xcite for an excellent review and additional references ) , where quantum field operators @xmath1 and their canonical momenta @xmath2 are time - independent , and the wave functional @xmath3 = \\langle \\phi(\\mathbf{x } ) | \\psi(t ) \\rangle$ ] is in general time - dependent , although we will not need to consider the full time - dependence in this paper .",
    "our goal is to approximately describe the quantum field theory using variational methods .",
    "we define the variational hamiltonian functional @xmath4 by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian operator for the quantum field theory .",
    "the variational method consists of minimizing this variational hamiltonian functional with respect to a set of variables which parameterize the wave functional @xmath7 .",
    "we make the ansatz that the variational wave functional is a gaussian , parameterized by a real - valued function @xmath8 and a real - valued symmetric kernel @xmath9 @xmath10 = n \\exp \\big [ - \\frac{1}{4 } \\int d^d\\mathbf{x } \\int d^d\\mathbf{x ' }      \\left ( \\phi(\\mathbf{x } ) - \\bar{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x } ) \\right ) g^{-1}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x ' } )       \\left ( \\phi(\\mathbf{x ' } ) - \\bar{\\phi}(\\mathbf{x ' } ) \\right ) \\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the spatial dimension .",
    "the kernel @xmath9 must be positive - definite in order for the variational wave function to be normalizable , and choosing @xmath12^{-1/4}$ ] assures that @xmath7 has unit norm .",
    "we will frequently describe the kernel @xmath9 as matrix elements of an operator @xmath13 acting on the space of single - particle wave functions .",
    "for example , in position space , @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to distinguish the state space of the quantum field theory where the states @xmath15 are defined and upon which the quantum field operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 act , and the space of single - particle wave functions where the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined and upon which operators such as @xmath13 and @xmath18 act . using the more compact operator notation , we may write the variational wave functional as @xmath10 = [ \\det(2\\pi g)]^{-1/4 } \\exp \\big [ \\ ! - \\frac{1}{4 } \\ , ( \\phi - \\bar{\\phi } ) \\ , g^{-1 } ( \\phi - \\bar{\\phi } ) \\big]\\ ] ]",
    "as it stands , this variational wave functional is a formal expression that will be given more concrete meaning through the regularization and renormalization procedures discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "although the vacuum state of the theory corresponds to @xmath19 , other values of the scalar field lead to a variety of physically meaningful and interesting results .",
    "considering states other than the vacuum is necessary to compute ( the variational approximation to ) the effective action for the quantum field theory .",
    "similar wave functionals are considered in @xcite , where those authors were motivated by studying entanglement entropy in the context of free field theory in 1 + 1 dimensions .",

    "we will be concerned with a quartic potential of the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a bare mass parameter and @xmath28 is a bare coupling parameter .",
    "the coupling @xmath28 has mass dimension 2 , 1 , and 0 in 1 + 1 , 2 + 1 , and 3 + 1 dimensions , respectively . using the gaussian variational wave functional @xmath7 and the hamiltonian operator @xmath6 , a straightforward calculation gives @xmath29 for the gradient - squared term in the hamiltonian",
    ", we find @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the momentum operator on the space of single - particle wavefunctions , given by @xmath32 in the position basis .",

    "we expect @xmath38 to be divergent , which we will address in subsequent discussions of renormalization .",

    "in addition to depending on the bare mass @xmath27 and bare coupling @xmath28 , @xmath48 is a function of @xmath8 and @xmath38 , so it may depend on position in general . in the case of a uniform system",
    ", @xmath48 will be a constant parameter .",
    "we now turn our attention to such static uniform systems .",
    "if we now restrict ourselves to spatially uniform systems , which are translation invariant , then @xmath16 does not depend on position and @xmath49 .",
    "additionally , the green function @xmath9 will only depend on the difference @xmath50 .",

    "once again , stevenson @xcite provides a clear discussion of these issues , and we merely summarize his findings . in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions , the concern is over infrared divergences . in these cases",

    "however , something even more interesting takes place : there is a duality relation that connects positive renormalized couplings to negative renormalized couplings , along with a rescaling of the mass parameter @xmath48 and the scalar field @xmath16 , and with an additive constant shift of the gep .",
    "the explicit formulas defining the duality transformation are @xmath131 where the asterisk denotes the dual values , and the scale factor @xmath132 is the solution of @xmath133 the entire range of positive couplings @xmath134 ( or equivalently negative inverse couplings @xmath135 ) gets mapped to a range of negative couplings @xmath136 ( or equivalently a range of positive inverse couplings @xmath137 ) under duality , so the duality mapping is one - to - one but not onto .",

    "we will express our results in terms of the negative renormalized couplings , although we will briefly discuss how some of these results look for positive couplings which are dual to the negative couplings for purposes of comparison with results in lower dimensions .    on the following pages",

    "since our variational ansatz for @xmath0 theory takes the same form as the ground state of a massive free scalar field , we would like to know how to compute the entanglement entropy of a massive free scalar field .",

    "we have found that in @xmath163 and @xmath169 dimensions , the entanglement entropy is monotonically decreasing and convex with respect to the coupling .",
    "this result is unexpected since the authors anticipated that larger coupling would lead to more entanglement .",
    "our results are accurate for small coupling , although the approximation scheme is well - defined for all values of the coupling .",
    "inspired by the variational results , we conjecture that the _ exact _ entanglement entropy in @xmath163 and @xmath169 is monotonically decreasing and convex with respect the coupling for the entire range of positive couplings .",
    "indeed , it would be strange if the derivative of the entanglement entropy switched signs for some particular value of the coupling .",

    "it would be interesting to see whether or not monotonicity and convexity with respect to coupling are generic features of entanglement entropy for qft s , and to explore why certain theories appear to have entanglement entropies which are monotonically _ decreasing _ with respect to coupling .",
