    "the spin - hall effect ( she ) is a fundamental physical phenomenon where the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) shows up in electron transport on a macroscopic level .",
    "the interplay of spin precession caused by soi and electron acceleration in the electric field gives rise to a flux of the out - of - plane spin polarization flowing perpendicular to the electric current .",
    "although this effect was predicted long time ago @xcite , it has been observed experimentally only recently in semiconductors @xcite and metals @xcite .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon is now well understood and studied for various systems ( for a review see ) .",
    "the spin - hall effect is being considered as a tool for manipulating electron spins in perspective spintronic applications . on the other hand ,",
    "the spin polarization accumulated due to she is subject to dissipative processes of spin relaxation and diffusion . from this point of view",
    ", it is interesting to consider she in superconductors , as well as in sns junctions , where the n - region is represented by a normal electron system with a strong enough spin - orbit coupling .",
    "also , in such systems she provides an opportunity for a direct coupling of spin degrees of freedom to superconducting quibits @xcite    an important distinction of spin - hall effects in superconducting and normal systems is that in the latter case this effect is determined by spin dynamics of single particles , while in the former case major role is played by interference of triplet and singlet cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the triplet correlations , in their turn , are induced in the condensate wave function by soi @xcite , and shows up as admixture to the singlet state .",
    "therefore , the spin current and spin accumulation caused by she are determined by a coherent macroscopic state and do not dissipate .",
    "she has been considered in bulk superconductors @xcite and sns tunneling contacts @xcite .",
    "also in such contacts an effect reciprocal to she was recently studied @xcite .",
    "these studies have been restricted to the stationary transport . in the case of sns junctions",
    "this means that the josephson electric current is driven by a phase difference of superconducting order parameters of two superconducting electrodes .",
    "if these electrodes have different electric potentials , this current will periodically vary in time .",
    "one would expect that , due to such a time dependence , the non - zero spin - hall current will be induced , while it is forbidden in the stationary case by the time inversion symmetry .",
    "@xcite one more nonstationary effect is associated with an electric field caused by a dynamic electron - hole charge imbalance within the normal layer .",
    "such a periodic field will drive a flux of the spin polarization , in a way quite similar to conventional she in normal systems .",

    "is also induced .,width=340 ]    the goal of the present study is to extend the theory of ref . to the case of the non - stationary josephson effect .",
    "we will calculate the spin - hall current and spin polarization created by a combined effects of the josephson tunneling and soi .",
    "it will be assumed that two singlet superconducting electrodes are under the dc electric voltage @xmath2 .",
    "the normal layer is contacted to them through the low transparency tunneling barriers , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "this layer is taken thin enough , so that electrons are restricted to 2d motion , as , for example in a semiconductor quantum well .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling in the n - layer is given by the rashba interaction @xcite and we will ignore the spin - orbit effects in scattering of electrons from impurities . at the same time",
    "the spin - independent scattering will be taken into account within the born approximation .",
    "the particle s mean free path @xmath3 will be assumed smaller than all relevant parameters of length dimension , except the fermi wavelength @xmath4 , which in the semiclassical approximation is much smaller than @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the electron transport within the n - layer is dominated by diffusion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "the general expressions for the spin - hall current and spin density are derived in sec .",
    "ii . in sec . iii some numerical results are presented and discussed . finally , appendix a presents some details of analytical calculations within the keldysh formalizm .",
    "since we will focus on the basic characteristics of she , the simplest approach will be employed within the lowest - order perturbation theory with respect to transmission coefficients of interface barriers .",
    "it should be noted , however , that higher - order corrections to the electric josephson current are not always small @xcite , in particular in the range of temperatures @xmath5 larger than the thouless energy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the diffusion constant and @xmath8 is the distance between contacts .",
    "we will assume the temperature or / and the transmission coefficient low enough to avoid such a situation .",

    "it will be treated within the random phase approximation to take into account screening effects associated with the dynamic charge imbalance , while its contribution to the self - energy and electron - electron correlations will be ignored .",
    "we assume that sns contact is unbounded in the @xmath1-direction .",
    "hence , the josephson current is in the @xmath27-direction , as shown in fig . 1 , and the spin - hall current polarized parallel to the @xmath0-axis flows in the @xmath1-direction and depends on the @xmath27-coordinate . in the framework of the keldysh formalism @xcite",

    "such a spin polarization is due to the electric spin orientation @xcite .",

    "the relevant diagrams are shown in fig.2 . comparing them to a diagram representation of the charge josephson current",
    "@xcite one can see that in the latter case diagrams are much simpler .",
    "that is because conservation of the josephson current allows to reduce its calculation to calculation of the charge time derivative in one of the superconducting terminals .",
    "unlike the josephson current , the spin current does not conserve and such a simplification is not possible . an additional problem is caused by time dependence of the charge transport .",
    "it results in an electric potential inside the n - layer .",
    "therefore , one should take into account diagrams which explicitly take into account the coulomb screening there .",

    ". therefore , additional studies are necessary for a more complicated system than considered here .    this work has been supported by taiwan nsc ( contract no .",
    "96 - 2112-m-009 - 0038-my3 ) and moe - atu grant .",
    "in this abstract some explanations will be done of how eqs .",
    "( [ js2 ] ) and ( [ j1])-([j2scr ] ) have been derived within keldysh diagrammatic technique .",
    "we start from definitions of green functions entering into perturbation expansions .",
    "each of the green functions is the matrix in the keldysh space @xcite : @xmath214 the elements of this matrix are 2@xmath302 matrices in the nambu space and 2@xmath302 matrices in the spin space . besides , they depend on two time arguments and two wavevectors @xmath19 and @xmath215 .",
    "these vectors are not equal , because there is no momentum conservation in the presence of impurity scattering . at the same time , the functions averaged over impurity positions become diagonal in the momentum space . considering @xmath216 as matrices in @xmath12-space and also the tunneling amplitudes @xmath217 in eq .",
    "( [ hint ] ) as elements of the matrix @xmath218 , one can write the expression for the spin current ( [ js ] ) in the fourth perturbation order with respect to the tunneling hamiltonian ( [ hint ] ) in the form      where @xmath220 and @xmath221 denote the green function of the superconductor and the normal metal , respectively . the operator @xmath222 .",
    "we explicitly wrote the nambu labels of functions , so that only the trace over spin and momentum variables must be taken in eq .",
    "( [ jsa ] ) . since only the josephson tunneling",
    "is considered , in the perturbation expansion we take into account only anomalous @xmath223 and @xmath224 functions of superconducting leads , neglecting thus the usual stationary one - particle tunneling .",
    "these functions can be written in the form @xmath225 where the signs `` - '' and `` + '' relate to the left and right superconducting leads , respectively .",
    "@xmath224 is obtained from this equation with the substitution @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "after fourier transform of green functions in eq .",
    "( [ jsa ] ) , the time dependent exponential factors in @xmath228 and @xmath229 give the factors @xmath230 in eq .",
    "( [ js2 ] ) .",
    "it is important that the functions @xmath231 and @xmath232 in eq .",
    "( [ jsa ] ) belong to different superconducting leads .",
    "therefore , they are independently averaged over impurity positions and , hence , are diagonal in the momentum space . in the spin space",
    "they are proportional to the pauli matrix @xmath233 , because , as it is discussed in section ii , these functions are associated with the singlet cooper pairing .",
    "it is easy to see that the keldysh component of a product @xmath234 of matrices having the triangular form ( [ keldysh ] ) can be written as the sum of products : @xmath235 .",
    "in all these products the keldysh function enters only once , while retarded and advanced functions are placed on the left and on the right from it , respectively .",
    "the time fourier expansions of thermally equilibrium keldysh functions @xmath216 and @xmath231 can be expressed in terms of retarded and advanced functions as @xmath236 we thus will apply the above expressions to the keldysh component of the product in eq.([jsa ] ) .",
    "this equation can be further simplified taking into account that @xmath237 , @xmath238 and distances of interest @xmath239 . therefore ,",
    "the main contribution to eq.([jsa ] ) is given by small frequencies @xmath240 .",
    "since the difference of retarded and advanced anomalous functions @xmath231 in eq.([keldysh2 ] ) gives an expression proportional to @xmath241 , the corresponding keldysh component can be neglected for small @xmath242 .",
    "the next step is averaging over disorder . from eqs .",
    "( [ jsa ] ) , ( [ keldysh2 ] ) , and taking into account that @xmath243 we get the following products to be averaged @xmath244 , @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 . in its turn , each of the green functions is a sum of products @xmath248 , where @xmath249 are diagonal in @xmath19 unperturbed functions and the number of impurity scattering amplitudes @xmath250 in each product is equal to the corresponding perturbation order .",
    "calculation of such averages is described in many textbooks ( for example , see ) .",
    "briefly , within the born approximation , assuming random impurity positions the averages of @xmath251 products decouples into pair averages . in this way",
    "each pair enters as an effective two - particle interaction carrying a zero frequency .",
    "so , the average of a green function can be expressed through the self - energy . in eq .",
    "[ g0 ] this self - energy is given by @xmath252 .",
    "when a product of green functions is averaged , a considerable simplification takes place in the semiclassical approximation when @xmath253 . in this case",
    "a special class of the so called `` ladder '' diagrams dominates in the perturbation expansion over disorder .",
    "let us consider , for example the average @xmath254 .",
    "combining in pairs @xmath250-s in @xmath255 with its neighbors on the left and on the right we obtain two ladder series",
    ". there are `` cooperons '' , according to definition ( [ k ] ) .",
    "they are shown as gray boxes in fig .",
    "at the same time , one can not build the ladder out of the pair @xmath256 .",
    "the reason is that the sum over @xmath19 of a typical ladder element , the product @xmath257 , where @xmath258 is given by eq .",
    "( [ g0 ] ) , turns to zero , because both functions have poles in the same semiplane of the complex variable @xmath259 . on the same reason the ladders built of @xmath260 also turn to zero , as follows from definition ( [ g0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the average @xmath261 contains only one cooperon originating from the first two functions . besides , the combination @xmath262 entering into this product , results in a diffuson defined by eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagram is shown in fig .",
    "2b .    in the same way , as the spin current",
    ", one may calculate the electric charge , substituting in eq .",
    "( [ jsa ] ) @xmath263 for @xmath264 .",
    "this charge is given by the sum of polygons in figs .",
    "3a and 3b .",
    "they represent @xmath265 and @xmath266 , respectively .",
    "further , the screening electric potential is calculated within the random phase approximation .",
    "this potential drives the spin - hall effect in the same way as in normal systems .",
