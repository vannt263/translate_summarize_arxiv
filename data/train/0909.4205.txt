    "the identification of high - redshift galaxies is crucial to developing our understanding of the early universe , galaxy evolution and the epoch of reionisation .",
    "one technique for selecting high - redshift galaxies is to search for lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) through the drop - out technique ( guhathakurta , tyson & majewski 1990 ; steidel , pettini & hamilton 1995 ; steidel et al .",
    "this relies on finding a significant flux decrement between two broadband filters indicating a spectral break short - ward of lyman-@xmath25 at 1215.7  in the rest frame of the galaxy , attributable to lyman-@xmath25 absorption from intervening clouds of neutral hydrogen at lower redshifts ( the lyman-@xmath25 forest ) . in higher - redshift galaxies",
    "this `` lyman break '' is pushed to longer wavelengths .",
    "recent years have witnessed two key developments in our understanding of the initial phases of galaxy formation .",
    "the first is the extension of the lyman - break selection technique to higher redshifts , so that broad - band colours can be used to identify galaxies at @xmath26 ( stanway , bunker & mcmahon 2003 ; bunker et al .",
    "the lyman - break `` @xmath2-drop '' selection has been spectroscopically confirmed to find galaxies at @xmath27 ( bunker et al .",
    "2003 ; stanway et al.2007 ) .",
    "the second key development is the revelation that @xmath28 is a crucial transition epoch in the history of the universe . the discovery of complete absorption by the lyman-@xmath25 forest ( the gunn - peterson trough ) in the spectra of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) at @xmath29 ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al.2002 ) indicates a large neutral fraction of hydrogen , and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) results suggest that the universe was entirely neutral at @xmath30 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) with a protracted period of reionization ( dunkley et al .",
    "2009 ) . hence , exploring the epoch @xmath31 is crucial if we are to understand what reionized the universe , and thus set the stage for galaxy formation at the end of the `` dark ages '' .",
    "specifically , ultra - violet ( uv ) light from star forming galaxies during this era has been proposed as the most likely reionization mechanism , as the number density of high - redshift active galactic nuclei ( agn ) appears too low to be solely responsible ( e.g. dijkstra et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "only a handful of galaxies are known at @xmath20 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ; ota et al .",
    "2008 ) , selected through lyman - break broad - band imaging and also narrow - band imaging for lyman-@xmath25 line emitting galaxies .",
    "the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy currently known was discovered by iye et al .",
    "( 2006 ) at @xmath32 and the highest redshift object is the gamma - ray burst found at @xmath33 ( tanvir et al .",
    "the frontier in spectroscopically confirmed galaxies and large robust samples of lyman break galaxies is currently @xmath27 . the data from the new vlt hawk - i camera ( pirard et al . , 2004 ; casali et al . ,",
    "2006 ) in the @xmath7-band filter in conjuction with the availability of isaac images over most of the acs / wfc goods - south area enables us to push this work even further in lookback time and to explore the redshift range @xmath34 .",
    "constraints have also been placed on the ultra violet luminosity function at @xmath35 by mannucci et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    to explore this population",
    "further we need a large sample of these galaxies .",
    "this has been hampered until now by a lack of sensitivity in the infra - red and the small fields of view available .",
    "now with hawk - i , an instrument with a large field of view ( 7.5 x 7.5 arcmin@xmath10 ) on the vlt , an 8-metre class telescope and critically with the @xmath7-band filter , we can begin to increase the number of lyman break candidates at @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath7-band filter is particularly important because it is a good discriminant of spectral breaks ( a sharp cutoff ) as opposed to dust reddening , which appears as a more gradual slope , as it is centered on @xmath36 m which is close in wavelength to the @xmath3 filter s peak transmisison wavelength of @xmath37 m ( see figure  [ fig : filters ] ) .",
    "the @xmath7-band filter is also currently being used by ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al .",
    "2007 ) to search for qsos at similar epochs ( e.g. venemans et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] we describe the imaging data .",
    "the construction of our catalogues , survey completeness , our @xmath3 and @xmath7-drop selection and the likely contaminants are discussed in section  [ sec : selection ] . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss our candidates and infer constraints on the rest - frame uv luminosity function of star - forming sources .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : concs ] . throughout",
    "we adopt the standard `` concordance '' cosmology of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and use @xmath40 .",
    "we use the @xmath41 magnitude system throughout ( oke & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "we analysed @xmath7-band observations from the eso / vlt archive obtained as part of hawk - i science verification program 60.a-9284(b ) ( fontana et al .  and venemans et al .",
    "`` a deep infrared view on galaxies in the early universe '' ) .",
    "two areas within the goods - south field were imaged , with centres 03:32:41.0 @xmath4227:51:45 ( pointing 1 ) and 03:32:29.6 @xmath4227:44:37 ( pointing 2 , both j2000 ) .",
    "the seeing in @xmath7-band was in the range @xmath43 ( fwhm ) in the individual exposures , with the stacked image having seeing of @xmath44 .",
    "individual exposure times were 30seconds , with 10 such exposures averaged to form a single co - added frame of 300seconds .",
    "a typical sequence was 12 exposures ( 1hour ) , although we used sequences with between 6 and 13 exposures .",
    "the telescope was dithered by 5 - 10@xmath45 between exposures .",
    "there were 18 sequences in pointing 1 ( comprising 195 frames in all , a total of 16.25hours ) , and 14 towards pointing 2 ( comprising 138 frames , amounting to 11.5hours ) .",
    "the hawk - i camera was read out in 4 quadrants , each of @xmath46 pixels with a scale @xmath47pixel@xmath48 , and initially these quadrants were reduced individually before final mosaiking .",
    "we subtracted the dark current and flat - fielded the data using the average of @xmath7-band twilight sky flats from the eso hawk - i archive . for each sequence of @xmath4912 exposures , we then used the dimsum package within iraf to background - subtract the sky , using the xmosaic task .",
    "we measured the image shifts interactively using a number of compact , bright but unsaturated sources .",
    "where there were 12 frames in a sequence , we used the average of the 5 frames before and 5 after ( with objects masked ) to determine the sky level .",
    "dimsum also rejected many of the cosmic rays present in the images .",
    "however , there were various electronic read - out artifacts visible which were pernicious and not removed by dimsum .",
    "hence when we combined the 1418 final frames output by dimsum , we used iraf.imcombine , weighting by the exposure time , with the ccdclip rejection algorithm , using the gain and readnoise properties of the detector and the poisson noise of the sky background .",
    "a detector artifact which was not effectively eliminated by this rejection was a cross - talk effect , whereby ghost images appeared in the same detector row as bright objects . as the apparent spatial position of the cross",
    "talk artifacts on the sky remains fixed with respect to the objects ( i.e. it moves with the objects on the detector during the dithering pattern ) , this was not rejected in the co - addition .",
    "we eliminated this later by visual inspection and by masking detector rows affected by bright objects .    for each quadrant and for both pointings we then determined the astrometry through comparison with the eso isaac @xmath4-band image ( retzlaff et al.)imaging@xmath50v2.0 ] using 60110 objects in each quadrant . a quadratic fit to the distortion produced residuals of @xmath51 between the coordinates in the @xmath4- and @xmath7-band images .",
    "the iraf.wregister routine was used to linearly interpolate the @xmath7-band images to map on to the same pixel grid as the @xmath4-band , with a pixel scale of @xmath52 .",
    "we summed the exposure maps output by dimsum using the same measured shifts , creating a map of the total exposure time as a function of position on the sky , and correcting the astrometric distortions as described above .",
    "this was then used to inverse - variance weight the images when we combined the four quadrants in both pointings to form a final image mosaic .",
    "the 119arcmin@xmath10 of the @xmath7-band image covered most of the eso @xmath4-band and _ hst _ acs goods images ( 97.5% of the hawk - i @xmath7-band image overlapped with the eso @xmath4-band ) .",
    "we used the goods team reductions of the acs images ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , consisting of f450w @xmath0-band , f606w @xmath1-band , f775w @xmath2-band and f850lp @xmath3-band .",
    "the goods images had been drizzled from the original acs pixel scale of @xmath53 on to a grid of @xmath54 pixels .",
    "we used version 2.0 of the acs goods images and adopted the ab magnitude zeropoints re - determined for the v2 release .    at the time of writing ,",
    "the formal @xmath7-band zero point for hawk - i was not available , so we determined the photometric zero point of the @xmath7-band by measuring the @xmath55 colours of objects in identical apertures of 1arcsec diameter , and setting the average ab colour of sources with flat spectra between the @xmath3 and @xmath4-band to be zero . using our computed zero point ,",
    "the ab magnitude in the @xmath7-band is given by @xmath56 where `` ap  corr '' is the aperture correction in magnitudes , and `` count rate '' is the number of counts per second recorded .",

    "the @xmath12 detection limit for a compact source in a 1arcsec - diameter aperture is @xmath11mag , however pointing 1 is slightly deeper and reaches @xmath14mag ( @xmath58 ) . in all , we survey @xmath59 to a maximum @xmath12 depth of @xmath14 , and an area of @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",

    "we block - averaged the drizzled @xmath71 acs pixels @xmath72 to produce a @xmath3-band frame which was registered to the vlt / isaac @xmath4-band .",
    "the limiting magnitudes in @xmath66 apertures for the vlt - isaac images are @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( @xmath12 ab magnitudes ) .",
    "we also made use of imaging of the goods - south field obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ; fazio et al .",
    "2004 ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _ which was conducted as part of the goods legacy program ( pid 194 , pi dickinson ) .",
    "irac uses four broad - band filters with central wavelengths at approximately 3.6@xmath75 m , 4.5@xmath75 m , 5.8@xmath75 m and 8.0@xmath75 m ( channels 14 ) .",
    "the data were taken over two observing epochs , with the telescope roll angle differing by @xmath76 , and we used the v2 and v3 reductions of the goods team , with the data drizzled onto a @xmath77 grid from the original @xmath78 pixels .",
    "we measure 5@xmath79 limiting magnitudes of 24.76 , and 24.87 for irac channels 1 and 2 respectively , measured in @xmath80 diameter apertures , and 22.77 and 22.81 for irac channels 3 & 4 measured in @xmath81 & @xmath82 diameter apertures respectively ( these limits include aperture corrections of @xmath83mag appropriate for unresolved sources , e.g. eyles et al . 2005 ; 2007 ) .",
    "candidate selection for all objects in the field was performed using version 2.4.6 of the sextractor photometry package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . as we are searching specifically for objects which drop - out at short wavelengths through the lyman-@xmath25 forest absorption , we used sextractor in dual - image mode , detecting objects in the longer - wavelength band and measuring the photometry within the same spatial apertures in the drop - out band(s ) .",
    "we produced separate catalogues for the @xmath7-band drop outs ( using the @xmath4-band as the detection image ) and the @xmath3-band drop - outs ( using the @xmath7-band as the detection image ) . to reduce the number of spurious sources in the noisy edge regions ( where few frames overlap ) we used the exposure maps as input weight maps for sextractor . for object identification",
    ", we adopted a limit of at least 5 contiguous pixels above a threshold of @xmath84 per pixel ( on the data drizzled to a scale of 015  pixel@xmath48 ) .",
    "spurious detections close to the noise limit were later eliminated through colour cuts and visual inspection .    as high redshift galaxies in the rest - uv are known to be compact ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; bouwens et al .",
    "2004 ) , we used fixed circular apertures @xmath66 in diameter to select our candidates and corrected the aperture magnitudes to approximate total magnitudes for each filter through an aperture correction , determined from bright compact sources .",
    "these were measured to be 0.07mag in @xmath3-band , 0.4mag in @xmath7-band and 0.4mag in @xmath4-band . for compact sources ,",
    "this approach is simpler and more reproducible than using the sextractor curve - of - growth total magnitudes .",
    "section 9 in the version 2.0 of the isaac @xmath4-band image produced a number of spurious sources when running sextractor in dual image mode and weighting on the exposure map .",
    "this appeared to be due to an overconfidence in the weight map on section 9 .",
    "this was corrected for by weighting on the background for this section alone and using the weight map for the rest of the @xmath4-band image .",
    "the completeness corrections for both the @xmath85 and the @xmath4-band images were measured in the following way .",
    "approximately 5000 artificial compact sources were created with diameters of 3 pixels and spanning magnitudes between 20 and 30 .",
    "these objects were then convolved with the psf and added in to the original image .",
    "the new images were run through sextractor again , using the same criteria that was employed to generate our object list .",
    "the resulting catalogues were compared with the list of input _ fake",
    "_ sources and a detection was considered to be made if a source was found within 5 pixels of its input position and had a magnitude correct to within a factor of 2 of the input flux .",
    "the number of detected sources was then compared to the number of input sources for each magnitude bin .    as described earlier , the @xmath7-band image consisted of two individual pointings of unequal depth , to measure an accurate completeness limit , the calculations were determined for both pointings separately .",
    "the filled circles in figure [ fig : ycomp ] show the @xmath7-band image for pointing 1 is @xmath86 per cent complete down to a magnitude of @xmath87 and is 50 per cent complete at a magnitude of @xmath14 over the deepest area . the @xmath7-band image for pointing 2 ( denoted by open diamonds in figure  [ fig : ycomp ] )",
    "is @xmath86 per cent complete down to a magnitude of @xmath87 and is 50 per cent complete at a magnitude of @xmath11 over the deepest area in that pointing .",

    "we calculated our @xmath12 limit in the @xmath7-band to be 25.9 in pointing 1 , which agrees with our 50 per cent completeness limit ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ycomp ] ) .",
    "we tested the sextractor parameters by reducing our detection thresholds and found they had little or no effect on our completeness implying that our original parameters of at least 5 pixels at @xmath92 or above were reasonable and did not eliminate credible sources from our selection .      [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : ycandidates ]    the @xmath7-drop candidate selection was carried out in the same manner as the @xmath3-drop selection .",
    "our criteria for the @xmath7-drop candidates were a colour difference of @xmath15 , a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath94 in the @xmath4-band and a value in both the @xmath7- and @xmath4-band exposure maps equivalent to a minimum of 2.5hours of observation in the @xmath7 band .",
    "this selection yielded a list of 133 possible @xmath7-drop candidates .",
    "we then compared our list to the goods music catalogue to eliminate the low redshift interlopers from our selection . in all , 98 of our 133 objects had matches within @xmath95 of our candidates .",
    "one of these objects had no detection in the bands @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 so we kept it in our candidate list .",

    "three of the candidates have strong detections in the irac wavebands .",
    "we obtained photometric redshifts for these objects because the detection at the irac wavelengths increases the likelihood of a valid detection and also improves the accuracy of the photometric redshift solutions .",
    "we used the publicly available software hyperz ( bolzonella , miralles & pell et al .",

    "we employed option 2 for the error treatment of an undetected source which assumes that the flux in that filter and its @xmath101 error are equal to half the flux of the limiting magnitude ( i.e. the error bar ranges from flux=0 to the @xmath101 limiting magnitude in that waveband ) .",

    "this means as the lyman break moves through the @xmath85band filter with increasing redshift its contribution to the @xmath3-band flux will decrease but may not entirely disappear .",
    "the @xmath102band source is slightly offset from the detection in the other wavebands for object 2200 , this prompted us to widen our search area in the goods - music catalogue to a @xmath66 radius .",
