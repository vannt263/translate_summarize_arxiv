    "pg1115 + 080  was the second gravitationally lensed quasar to be discovered , and the first found to be quadruple @xcite . it has been the subject of numerous studies at wavelengths ranging from radio to mid - infrared to optical to uv to x - ray .",
    "the lensing galaxy is a member of a small group of galaxies , the tide from which produces the quadrupole moment needed to produce four images @xcite .",
    "it was the first gravitationally lensed system to yield multiple time delays @xcite .",
    "the optical images show uncorrelated flux variations on a timescale of order one year , presumably the result of microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy .",
    "pg1115 + 080  is an example of what @xcite call an `` inclined quad , '' a system with a close , bright pair of images that results when a lensed source lies just inside a `` fold '' caustic @xcite .",
    "several very similar systems have subsequently been discovered . in each case , one of the two close images is a minimum of the light travel time surface , and the other is a saddlepoint . from quite general considerations , if the gravitational potential is smooth , one expects the close , bright pair to be mirror images of each other and therefore very nearly equal in brightness @xcite .",
    "_ all _ of the known inclined quads violate this prediction , despite the fact that such models fit the observed image positions to within a few percent .",
    "this phenomenon has come to be known as the `` flux ratio anomaly '' problem .    in this regard pg1115",
    "+ 080  is the _",
    "anomalous among the inclined quads . in the earliest images that resolved the close pair , the ratio of the flux of the saddlepoint ( @xmath3 ) to that of the minimum ( @xmath4 ) was very nearly unity . by the mid-1980s",
    "the ratio had decreased to @xmath2@xmath5 .",
    "recent optical observations ( see  [ sec : opt - obs ] ) give a ratio closer to @xmath2@xmath6 .",
    "by contrast the corresponding optical ratios for inclined quads wfij2026@xmath74536 , hs0810 + 2554 , mg0414 + 0534 , and sdssj0924 + 0219 are approximately @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively . for this last case ,",
    "@xcite argue that microlensing by stars ( rather than millilensing by dark matter subcondensations ) is responsible for the anomaly . @xcite and",
    "@xcite predict a substantial brightening of the faint saddlepoint in sdssj0924 + 0219 on a timescale of roughly one decade if the microlensing hypothesis is correct .",
    "@xcite argue that the saddlepoint in pg1115 + 080  would likewise be expected to get substantially ( a factor of 2 or more ) fainter on a similar timescale .",
    "but over the course of a quarter century pg1115 + 080  has declined to cooperate , at least at optical wavelengths .    in the present paper",
    "we report that pg1115 + 080  has indeed been exhibiting microlensing of the expected amplitude , but at x - ray wavelengths rather than at optical wavelengths . in  [ sec : obs ] we describe the x - ray and optical observations and our analysis . in  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss implications for the lensing galaxy and for the relative sizes of the quasar s optical and x - ray emitting regions .",

    "based on the individually fitted power laws , the unabsorbed 0.58 kev flux of image c is @xmath42  @xmath43  in obsid 363 and @xmath44  @xmath43  in obsid 1630 .",
    "these serve as useful reference fluxes since image c is fairly uncontaminated by flux from the other images and is also a minimum image and therefore less susceptible to fluctuations .",

    "using keeton s ( 2001 ) lensmodel software , we modeled the lensing potential as a singular isothermal sphere accompanied by a second , offset singular isothermal sphere , which provides a quadrupole moment .",

    "we used the image positions provided by the castles lens survey , and did not constrain the fluxes .",

    "[ sec : xray - obs ] , the contemporaneous x - ray flux ratio is less than 0.2 , inconsistent not only with the predictions of the smooth models , but with the optical observations as well .",
    "microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy could in principle account for such flux ratios , but only if the source is small compared to the einstein radii of the microlensing stars .",
    "our simple model has convergence , @xmath77 , and shear , @xmath78 , roughly equal at the image positions , with magnifications @xmath79 of 19.9 for the @xmath4 image and @xmath719.0 for the @xmath3 image .",
    "examples of point source magnification histograms for pairs of images very much like those in pg1115 + 080  are presented by schechter and wambsganss , with magnifications for @xmath4 and @xmath3 of 10 and 16 , respectively @xcite .",
    "they present histograms both for the case when 100% of the convergence is due to stars and for the case when only 20% of the convergence is due to stars and the rest is due to a smooth dark component .",
    "the x - ray flux ratio rules out neither hypothesis but is considerably more likely if dark matter is present .",
    "until now , it was a bit of a puzzle why the optical flux anomalies had failed to deviate from unity as much as was predicted by these histograms .",
    "now it appears that it was because the optical region is too large to be strongly microlensed ( see  [ sec : sizes ] ) . as schechter & wambsganss note ,",
    "the determination of the dark matter fraction of lensing galaxies using the statistics of flux ratio anomalies is made considerably more difficult if the source size is comparable to that of a stellar einstein ring .",
    "it seems now that the x - ray flux ratio anomalies offer a cleaner determination of the dark matter fraction than the optical anomalies .",
    "according to the microlensing model for flux - ratio anomalies , discussed below , @xmath3 is expected to brighten in x - rays on a timescale of @xmath210 years , and follow - up _ chandra _  observations will be able to directly test this . as @xmath3 brightens , the unresolved flux will also increase . to look for past signs of this effect , we searched the high energy astrophysics science archive research center , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center , for other x - ray observations of pg1115 + 080  and found two _ rosat _  observations and three relevant _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "the _ rosat",
    "_  observations and an earlier _ einstein _ observation are analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _  count rates were converted to unabsorbed 0.52 kev fluxes using webpimms @xcite with the assumptions of an absorbed power law of photon index 1.65 and a column density of @xmath36  @xmath37 .",
    "for the _ xmm _  observations , we extracted spectra of pg1115 + 080  from the epic - pn and both epic - mos detectors .",
    "we performed joint spectral fits ( on all quasar images added together ) in the 0.510 kev band for each observation with simple absorbed power laws with the column density fixed at the galactic value .",
    "these gave acceptable fits , from which we computed the unabsorbed 0.52 kev fluxes .",
    "we also used our previous _",
    "chandra _",
    "joint fits to compute the total 0.52 kev fluxes ( from all quasar images added together ) from the _ chandra _  observations .",
    "the long - term x - ray light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : ltlc ] .",
    "from the seven measurements of the lensed flux from pg1115 + 080  over the course of 12.5 years , the mean is @xmath80  @xmath43 , and the sample standard deviation is @xmath81  @xmath43 , or @xmath240% .",
    "there is no evidence for strong short term variability from the individual lensed images in the _ chandra _  data , nor is there evidence for strong short term variability within the three _ xmm _  observations ( in which the individual images are unresolved )",
    ".    as discussed above , if the demagnification of @xmath3 is due to microlensing , the unresolved flux will rise as @xmath3 becomes less demagnified .",
    "the observed relative x - ray fluxes of the four images @xmath82 are @xmath83 ( based on obsid 363 ; see table  [ tab : xrayfits ] ) . if @xmath3 were to rise in flux to match @xmath4 , the overall change in flux would be @xmath250%",
    "the recent _ xmm _",
    "observations show that the x - ray flux has risen @xmath230% since the _ chandra _  observations from six years ago ( figure  [ fig : ltlc ] ) .",
    "however , there is an obvious degeneracy between a rise in the flux of @xmath3 and typical quasar variability over the course of many years .",
    "the size scales of the emission regions in quasars are difficult to probe directly since they are on the microarcsecond scale or smaller .",
    "the use of temporal variability for inferring sizes is indirect and becomes impractical for distant quasars .",
    "by contrast , microlensing directly explores angular scales of ( by definition ) microarcseconds . of the emission features of the quasar , only those which subtend smaller angles on the sky than the einstein radius of the microlenses will exhibit strong variations in flux .",
    "figure  [ fig : fxi ] displays the results from our study of pg1115 + 080 . here we have plotted the ratio of angular scale for different regions of the quasar , @xmath84 , to the einstein radius of a solar - mass microlens , @xmath85 . for ratios greater than unity ,",
    "microlensing should be strongly suppressed ( for a detailed analysis see * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio @xmath86 is plotted against the assumed mass of the central black hole , @xmath87 . for every value of @xmath87 there is a corresponding eddington luminosity which can be compared to the observed values of @xmath88  ( @xmath89  @xmath43 ; 0.58 kev ; this work ) and @xmath90 ( @xmath91  @xmath43 , from a sum of the v- , i- , and h - band data provided by the castles lens survey ) for pg1115 + 080  ( see the top axis label ) . within the @xmath86 vs.  @xmath87 plane we plot contours of constant size in units of @xmath92 , the gravitational radius of the black hole ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "as is evident from the plot , the x - rays , which should arise deep in the gravitational potential well of the black hole , should be microlensable for any @xmath94 .",
    "this is in clear agreement with the large x - ray flux ratio anomalies observed for pg1115 + 080  and for two other quad lenses : rxj0911 + 0554 and rxj1131@xmath71231 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the broad - line emission region should not be microlensable , except for a lower mass black hole ( i.e. , @xmath95 ) .",
    "finally , the dotted and dashed curves mark the radii within which 50% of the power in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 bands emerge , respectively , for a simple thin accretion disk model . according to these curves ,",
    "the optical continuum ought to be microlensed by approximately the same amount as in the x - ray band , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "but clearly it is not !    using _ hst _  spectra , @xcite found that the @xmath29 ratio in the ultraviolet continuum is @xmath20.5 and decreases to shorter wavelengths , indicating that the uv is more severely microlensed than the optical but less microlensed than the x - rays .",
    "therefore , within the microlensing scenario , we can conclude that the continuum optical emission from pg1115 + 080  comes from much further out than the uv , which in turn comes from further out than the x - rays .",
    "in particular , we find that the optical emission comes from a region @xmath210100 times larger than expected for a thin accretion disk model ( for @xmath87 in the range @xmath98 ) . since @xmath90 dominates @xmath88  in pg1115 + 080  ( and for many other luminous quasars ) , this is difficult to understand from an energetics point of view , since the energy released goes as @xmath99 .",
    "of course the optical light could be scattered by a large - scale plasma region ; however , in that case one would expect the x - rays to be scattered as well , and hence share a similar effective emission region .",
    "thus , while the x - ray images clearly appear to be microlensed , the bulk of the optical emission must be coming from @xmath21003000@xmath92 from the central black hole ( for @xmath87 in the range @xmath98 ) .    in coming to these conclusions , we have neglected special- and general - relativistic effects in the emissions from the accretion disk , except for cosmological redshift .",
    "in addition , we have followed @xcite in assuming a kerr black hole with a large spin parameter ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "this is consistent with estimates for a typical quasar @xcite , and implies an innermost disk radius of @xmath101 and a binding energy per mass @xmath102 .",
    "we have also set the bolometric luminosity to 33% of the eddington luminosity , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "neither of these parameter assumptions has a strong effect on the size of the predicted optical emission region for a thin accretion disk model .",
    "we have made use of optical data collected over the past 22 years to demonstrate that the bright , close pair of lensed images of pg1115 + 080  has a consistent flux ratio ( @xmath29 ) of @xmath20.70.8 .",
    "x - ray observations with _ chandra _ , covering two epochs separated by 5 months , indicate a much more extreme flux ratio of @xmath20.2 . both the optical and x - ray ratios are anomalous with respect to smooth lensing models , which predict a flux ratio of 0.96 .",
    "we used a comparison of the optical and x - ray flux ratio anomalies to argue in favor of the microlensing origin of the anomalies , and to show that the optical emission region is much larger ( i.e. , @xmath2@xmath103 ) than predicted by a simple thin accretion disk model .",

    "<S> pg1115 + 080  is a quadruply lensed quasar at @xmath0 whose image positions are well fit by simple models of the lens galaxy ( at @xmath1 ) . at optical wavelengths , </S>",
    "<S> the bright close pair of images exhibits a modest flux ratio anomaly ( factors of @xmath21.21.4 over the past 22 years ) with respect to these same models . </S>",
    "<S> we show here that as observed in x - rays with _ chandra _ , the flux ratio anomaly is far more extreme , roughly a factor of 6 . </S>",
    "<S> the contrasting flux ratio anomalies in the optical and x - ray band confirm the microlensing hypothesis and set a lower limit on the size of the optical continuum emission region that is @xmath210100 times larger than expected from a thin accretion disk model . </S>"
