    "we study white dwarf stars because they are the end - points of stellar evolution for the majority of all stars , and their composition and structure can tell us about their prior history .",
    "we can determine the internal structure of pulsating white dwarfs by observing their variations in brightness over time , using the techniques of high speed photometry to define their light curves , and then matching these observations with a numerical model which behaves the same way .",
    "the parameters of the model are chosen to correspond one - to - one with the physical processes that give rise to the variations , so a good fit to the data leads us to believe that our model reflects the actual physics of the stars themselves .",
    "although this procedure is simple in outline , its realization in practice requires specialized instrumentation to overcome the practical difficulties we encounter in the process .",
    "the whole earth telescope ( wet ) observing network @xcite was developed to provide the 200 or more hours of essentially gap - free data we require for the analysis .",
    "this instrument is now mature , and has provided a wealth of seismological data on the different varieties of pulsating white dwarf stars , so the observational part of the procedure is well in hand .",
    "now we are working to improve our analytical procedures to take full advantage of the possibilities afforded by asteroseismology .",
    "the adjustable parameters in our computer models of white dwarfs presently include the total mass , the temperature , hydrogen and helium layer masses , core composition , convective efficiency , and composition transition profiles . finding a proper set of these to provide a close fit to the observed data",
    "is difficult .",
    "the traditional procedure is a cut - and - try process guided by intuition and experience , and is far more subjective than we would like .",
    "more objective procedures are essential if asteroseismology is to become a widely - accepted astronomical technique",
    ". we must be able to demonstrate that , within the range of different values the model parameters can assume , we have found the only solution or the best one if more than one is possible .",
    "an optimization scheme based on a genetic algorithm ( ga ) can avoid the problems inherent in the traditional approach .",
    "restrictions on the range of the parameter - space are imposed only by observational constraints and by the physics of the model .",
    "although the parameter - space so defined is often quite large , the ga provides a relatively efficient means of searching globally for the best - fit model .",
    "while it is difficult for gas to find precise values for the best - fit set of parameters , they are very good at finding the region of parameter - space that contains the global minimum . in this sense",
    ", the ga is an objective means of finding a good first guess for a more traditional method which can then narrow in on the precise values and uncertainties of the best - fit set of parameters .",
    "the underlying ideas for genetic algorithms were inspired by charles darwin s @xcite notion of biological evolution through natural selection .",
    "the basic idea is to solve an optimization problem by _ evolving _ the best solution from an initial set of completely random guesses .",
    "the theoretical model provides the framework within which the evolution takes place , and the individual parameters controlling it serve as the genetic building blocks .",
    "observations provide the selection pressure . for a detailed description of genetic algorithms , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "initially , the parameter - space is filled uniformly with trials consisting of randomly chosen values for each parameter , within a range based on the physics that the parameter is supposed to describe .",
    "the model is evaluated for each trial , and the result is compared to the observed data and assigned a _ fitness _ inversely proportional to the variance . a new generation of trials",
    "is then created by selecting from this population at random , weighted by the fitness .    each model",
    "is encoded into a long string of numbers analogous to a chromosome with each parameter serving as a gene .",
    "the encoded trials are paired up and modified in order to explore new regions of parameter - space .",
    "the two basic genetic operators are _ crossover _ which emulates reproduction , and _ mutation _ which emulates happenstance .",
    "after these operators have been applied , the strings are decoded back into sets of numerical values for the parameters .",
    "the new generation replaces the old one , and the process begins again .",
    "the evolution continues for a specified number of generations , chosen to maximize the efficiency of the method .",
    "during a survey of eighty - six suspected white dwarf stars in the lowell gd lists , @xcite classified gd 358 as a helium atmosphere ( db ) white dwarf based on its spectrum .",
    "photometric @xmath0 and @xmath1 colors were later determined by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "time - series photometry by @xcite revealed the star to be a pulsating variable  the first confirmation of a new class of variable ( dbv ) white dwarfs predicted by @xcite .    in may 1990 ,",
    "gd 358 was the target of a coordinated observing run with the wet .",
    "the results of these observations were reported by @xcite , and the theoretical interpretation was given in a companion paper by @xcite .",
    "they found a series of nearly equally - spaced periods in the power spectrum which they interpreted as non - radial _",
    "g_-mode pulsations of consecutive radial overtone .",
    "they attempted to match the observed periods and the period spacing for these modes using earlier versions of the same theoretical models we have used in this analysis ( see  [ modsect ] ) .",
    "their optimization method involved computing a grid of models near a first guess determined from general scaling arguments and analytical relations developed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the most important parameters affecting the pulsation properties of dbv white dwarf models are the total stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) , the effective temperature ( @xmath3 ) , and the mass of the atmospheric helium layer ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we want to be careful to avoid introducing any subjective bias into the best - fit determination simply by defining the range of the search too narrowly . for this reason",
    ", we have specified the range for each parameter based only on the physics of the model , and on observational constraints .",
    "the distribution of masses for isolated white dwarf stars , generally inferred from measurements of @xmath5 , is strongly peaked near 0.6 @xmath6  with a fwhm of about 0.1 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "isolated main sequence stars with masses near the limit for helium ignition produce c / o cores more massive than about 0.45 @xmath6 , so white dwarfs with masses below this limit must have helium cores @xcite .",
    "however , the universe is not presently old enough to produce helium core white dwarfs through single star evolution . we confine our search to masses between 0.45 @xmath6  and 0.95 @xmath6 .",
    "although some white dwarfs    3.5 in are known to be more massive than the upper limit of our search , these represent a very small fraction of the total population , and for reasonable assumptions about the mass - radius relation all known dbvs appear to have masses within the range of our search @xcite .    the span of effective temperatures within which db white dwarfs are pulsationally unstable is known as the db instability strip .",
    "the precise location of this strip is the subject of some debate , primarily because of difficulties in matching the temperature scales from ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy and the possibility of hiding trace amounts of hydrogen in the envelope @xcite .",
    "the most recent temperature determinations for the 8 known dbv stars were done by @xcite .",
    "these measurements , depending on various assumptions , place the red edge as low as 21,800 k , and the blue edge as high as 27,800 k. our search includes all temperatures between 20,000 k and 30,000 k.    the mass of the atmospheric helium layer must not be greater than about @xmath7 or the pressure of the overlying material would theoretically initiate helium burning at the base of the envelope . at the other",
    "extreme , none of our models pulsate for helium layer masses less than about @xmath8 over the entire temperature range we are considering @xcite .",
    "the practical limit is actually slightly larger than this theoretical limit , and is a function of mass .",
    "for the most massive white dwarfs we consider , our models run smoothly with a helium layer as thin as @xmath9 , while for the least massive the limit is @xmath10 ( see figure 1 ) .      to find the theoretical pulsation modes of a white dwarf , we start with a static model of a pre - white dwarf and allow it to evolve quasi - statically until it reaches the desired temperature .",
    "we then calculate the adiabatic non - radial oscillation frequencies for the output model .",
    "the initial ` starter ' models can come from detailed calculations that evolve a main - sequence star all the way to its pre - white dwarf phase , but this is generally only important for accurate models of the hot do white dwarfs .",
    "for the cooler db and da white dwarfs , it is sufficient to start with a hot polytrope of order 2/3 ( i.e. @xmath11 ) .",
    "the cooling tracks of these polytropes converge with those of the pre - white dwarf models well above the temperatures at which db and da white dwarfs are observed to be pulsationally unstable @xcite .    to allow fitting for the total mass , we generated a grid of 100 starter models with masses between 0.45 and 0.95 @xmath6 .",
    "the entire grid originated from a 0.6 @xmath6  carbon - core polytrope starter model .",
    "we performed a homology transform on this model to generate three new masses : 0.65 , 0.75 , and 0.85 @xmath6 .",
    "we relaxed each of these three , and then used all four to generate the grid .",
    "all models with masses below 0.6 @xmath6  were generated by a direct homology transform of the original 0.6 @xmath6  polytrope .",
    "for masses between @xmath12 @xmath6  and from @xmath13 @xmath6 , we used homology transforms of the relaxed 0.65 @xmath6  and 0.75 @xmath6  models respectively .",
    "the models with masses greater than 0.9 @xmath6  were homology transforms of the relaxed 0.85 @xmath6  model .    to evolve a starter model to a specific temperature",
    ", we used the white dwarf evolution code ( wdec ) described in detail by @xcite and by @xcite .",
    "this code was originally written by martin schwarzschild , and has subsequently been updated and modified by many others including : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) for the cores of our models come from @xcite , and from @xcite for the envelopes .",
    "we use the updated opal opacity tables from @xcite , neutrino rates from @xcite , and the ml3 mixing - length prescription of @xcite .",
    "the evolution calculations for the core are fully self - consistent , but the envelope is treated separately .",
    "the core and envelope are stitched together and the envelope is adjusted to match the boundary conditions at the interface . adjusting",
    "the helium layer mass involves stitching an envelope with the desired thickness onto the core before starting the evolution . because this is done",
    "while the model is still very hot , there is plenty of time to reach equilibrium before the model approaches the final temperature .",
    "we determined the pulsation frequencies of the output models using the adiabatic non - radial oscillation ( anro ) code described by @xcite , originally written by carl hansen , which solves the pulsation equations using the runge - kutta - fehlberg method .",
    "we have made extensive practical modifications to these programs , primarily to allow models to be calculated without any intervention by the user .",
    "the result is a combined evolution / pulsation code that runs smoothly over a wide range of input parameters .",
    "we call this new code wd-40 .",
    "given a mass , temperature , and helium layer mass within the ranges discussed above , wd-40 will evolve and pulsate the specified white dwarf model and return a list of the theoretical pulsation periods .",
    "the execution time for a single db model on a reasonably fast computer is less than a minute .",
    "the genetic algorithm approach , however , requires the evaluation of many thousands of such models . to be practical",
    ", we ran the code in parallel on a specialized computational instrument  a collection of minimal pcs connected by a network  which we designed and built for this project ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the most recent version of a public - domain ga ( called pikaia ) described in detail by @xcite . to allow the evaluation of models in parallel",
    ", we incorporated the message passing routines of the parallel virtual machine ( pvm ) software @xcite into the `` full generational replacement '' evolution option of pikaia .",
    "our strategy was to use pikaia as a _ master _ program to exchange data with many copies of the wd-40 code serving as _ slave _ processes .",
    "the master program sends sets of parameters to slave processes running on every available processor , and then listens for responses .",
    "it sends new jobs after each response , and continues until all of the trials for a particular generation have been calculated .",
    "the master program then performs the genetic shuffling to come up with a new generation of trials to be calculated .",
    "this continues for a specified number of generations , and the best solution in the final population of trials is used as the first guess for a more traditional approach .",
    "the slave processes , when they receive data from the master program , evolve a white dwarf model with the specified properties , calculate the pulsation periods , and compare them to the observed periods .",
    "the relative fitness of the trial  which we define as the inverse of the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "residuals between the observed and calculated pulsation periods  is then sent back to the master program .",
    "we used a population size of 128 trials , and initially allowed the ga to run for 250 generations .",
    "we used 2-digit decimal encoding for each of the three parameters , which resulted in a temperature resolution of 100 k , a mass resolution of 0.005 @xmath6 , and a resolution for the helium layer thickness of 0.05 dex .",
    "the uniform single - point crossover probability was fixed at 85% , and the mutation rate was allowed to vary between 0.1% and 16.6% , depending on the linear distance in parameter - space between the trials with the median and the best fitnesses .      to quantify the efficiency of our method for this problem , we used the wd-40 code to calculate the pulsation periods of a model within the search space , and then attempted to find the set of input parameters [ @xmath14  k , @xmath15 @xmath6 , @xmath16 using the ga .",
    "we performed 20 independent runs using different pseudo - random number sequences each time .",
    "the first order solutions found in each case by the ga are listed in table 1 . in 9 of the 20 runs ,",
    "the ga found the exact set of input parameters , and in 4 other runs it finished in a region of parameter - space close enough for a small ( 1331 point ) grid to reveal the exact answer .",
    "since none                  we have seen the first indications that our models of white dwarf stars are incomplete .",
    "we hope to identify and correct these weaknesses in the models by tackling the problem in reverse .",
    "now that we have an objective global best - fit model , we can investigate what changes to the internal structure of the model ( parameterized by the brunt - visl frequency ) lead to even better fits than are possible with the current generation of models .",
    "this may lead us to identify regions of the interior where an improved knowledge of the constitutive physics would be most useful .",
    "we would like to thank mike montgomery , paul bradley , s.o .",
    "kepler , and craig wheeler for helpful discussions , paul charbonneau for supplying us with an unreleased version of the pikaia genetic algorithm , and gary hansen for arranging the donation of 32 computer processors through amd .",
