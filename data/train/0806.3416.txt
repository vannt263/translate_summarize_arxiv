    "refinements in fabrication techniques that have occurred over the past twelve years have made it possible to create devices that exploit and display the interplay between ferromagnetic and superconducting orderings in superconductor / ferromagnet ( sf ) heterostructures .",
    "these developments have raised the possibility of building devices that may be used to manipulate and detect spin polarized currents .",
    "such devices , besides being of obvious considerable scientific interest , have technological applications for spintronics.@xcite it has been suggested that the introduction of an f layer into solid - state qubits may allow a stabilization of the state of the junction without the need for an external field.@xcite study of sf bilayer devices may illuminate the behavior of other systems that undergo spin / charge separation.@xcite spin / charge separation occurs when an electron is injected into a superconductor at the gap edge .",
    "the charge is absorbed by the condensate and quickly carried away by the supercurrent while its spin excitation remains.@xcite the different spin orderings of the s and f layers lead to spin dependent transport effects , providing ways to study phenomena such as spin polarization , spin - diffusion lengths , and spin - relaxation times.@xcite other potential applications and device geometries are discussed elsewhere.@xcite earlier work is extensively reviewed in ref .  . the knowledge gained from sf spin probes can lead , if the results are properly analyzed , to a better understanding of spin transport properties in different materials and nanostructures .",
    "thanks to the new technologies mentioned above , transport in clean sf bilayers is a very active subject of experimental research , but it remains a difficult topic theoretically .",
    "the problem of calculating the conductance of an s / f bilayer has been solved,@xcite but only in a non - self - consistent manner , that is , by assuming the superconducting order parameter to behave as a sharp step function at the interface .",
    "this assumption neglects the proximity effect , the `` leaking '' of superconductivity into the ferromagnet ( and , _ vice versa _",
    ", that of the magnetism into the superconductor ) that occurs in real systems . thus , the proximity effect makes it impossible to identify a precise location where the superconducting correlations end and the ferromagnetic ones begin .",
    "even with this simplification , the non - self - consistent approach is still far from trivial , as one must consider andreev reflection , @xcite the spin asymmetries due to the exchange interaction , and the spin coupling at the interface .",
    "nevertheless , the stark fact remains that neglecting a self - consistent order parameter amounts to no less than omitting all influence of s / f proximity effects .",
    "we remedy this situation in this paper , where we show how the difficulties associated with the proximity effect can be overcome and how a self - consistent calculation of the conductance can be achieved .",
    "the inclusion of the order parameter in a fully self - consistent manner allows us to fully account for the influence of the proximity effect , leading to correct , accurate and more interesting results at the worthwhile cost of having to solve a much more complicated problem .",
    "the self - consistent procedure results in the physical situation of a scattering potential that is dependent on the wavefunctions of the scattered particles and holes .",
    "there is no analytic approach that will give a fully self - consistent pair amplitude for this problem : a numerical approach must be taken .",
    "the spatial variations in the pair amplitude complicate the details of andreev reflection@xcite since the density of states ( dos ) can no longer be described as having a well defined bcs gap,@xcite and one must consider sub - gap states and even gapless superconductivity . since there is no exact analytic solution for the spatial variations in the pair amplitude at an sf interface ,",
    "there is no analytic solution for the dos either , nor _ a fortiori _ for the conductance . in short , this is a complicated four - component scattering problem without an analytic form for the scattering potential . despite these difficulties ,",
    "the proximity effect must not be neglected , as it has , as we shall see , a strong influence on the results and on the way experimental data must be analyzed .",
    "early experimental work@xcite was done on devices with an insulating oxide layer between the s and f layers , thus incorporating a superconductor / insulator / ferromagnet ( sif ) tunnel junction .",
    "the stable oxide layer prevented the diffusion of ferromagnetic impurities into the superconductor , making it possible to work in the clean limit .",
    "one disadvantage of sif systems is that a tunnel barrier inhibits the proximity effect .",
    "another disadvantage of the sif junction is the reduced spin coherence lengths .",
    "while the electrons merely tunnel through the insulator , the strong binding to the lattice leads to spin decoherence .",
    "these tunnel junctions provide good information on the superconducting dos , but it is dubious whether they provide a good picture of the state of the ferromagnet near the interface , and they will certainly not reveal the consequences of the proximity effect . other work@xcite in a spin transistor geometry demonstrated the possibility of growing sf interfaces over a large area with no insulating oxide layer .",
    "the purpose of that study was to explore transverse spin currents , not to examine bilayer conductance at the sf interface . also , it is not clear that there was no diffusion of magnetic atoms at the interface .",
    "more recent@xcite work has focused on bilayer conductance in planar junctions with sharp interfaces and clean materials .",
    "characteristic peaks in the conductance were observed at bias voltages corresponding to @xmath0 , the bulk superconducting gap energy , and an enhanced conductance at zero bias .",
    "point contact bilayers offer a convenient method for studying relatively abrupt interfaces.@xcite these devices are made by growing an oxide layer , thick enough to suppress tunneling , on top of a planar ferromagnet .",
    "a small hole is made through the oxide , and a superconductor is grown on top .",
    "this geometry prevents diffusion of ferromagnetic atoms during growth and allows for a uniform magnetic field . in this way",
    ", it is possible to study experimentally@xcite the conductance of clean sf bilayers in the ballistic limit .",
    "a quicker method for making point contacts mechanically places the tip of a sharpened superconducting wire on a bulk f sample.@xcite while such a technique gives poor control over the size and shape of the contact , it is technologically a very desirable procedure as it leads to quickly obtained results , and therefore it may be used to probe the spin states of many different types of f materials .",
    "however , the analysis of the data , and of conductance spectroscopy experimental results generally , has been hampered by incomplete understanding of how to relate data and theory .",
    "we will extensively address this issue in this work .",
    "we will be able to show that there is a clear influence of the proximity effect on transport at sf interfaces , which will enhance our understanding of these devices .",
    "this will also show that fully self - consistent studies are necessary to actually understand these point contact devices .    in the case of strong interfacial scattering , andreev reflection and the proximity effect",
    "are suppressed . in the limit of a very large interfacial barrier ,",
    "the conductance reflects essentially the superconducting dos .",
    "if we work with small or medium interfacial barriers , as is the case here , andreev reflection and the proximity effect become very important , leading to a much more interesting but also much more difficult problem . in the small barrier limit andreev reflection",
    "can lead to an enhancement of sub - gap conductance@xcite since a single electron from f must excite a pair of electrons in s. this agrees with experimental observations of zero bias conductance.@xcite the proximity effect changes the local dos@xcite in the vicinity of the junction , introducing sub - gap states and even gapless superconductivity .",
    "semiclassical methods , such as the eilenberger or usadel equations,@xcitecan give a reasonable approximation to the conductance curves@xcite in dirty systems .",
    "however , such models are not appropriate for clean systems , and can lead to spurious predictions.@xcite a common phenomenological approach is to define a current polarization parameter@xcite based upon the difference in spin - up and spin - down dos in f. the portion of the transmission coefficient due to the andreev reflected hole ( ar hole ) is calculated for an sn interface .",
    "since the ar hole must be in the opposite spin band of the incident electron , the ar hole coefficient is modified by a simple function of the polarization parameter .",
    "this is a reasonable phenomenological approach , but it lacks any microscopic justification , and is usually of limited success.@xcite    there have been many attempts to derive a fully microscopic model to describe the conductance in sf systems.@xcite these studies have used an abrupt approximation for the pair amplitude at the interface , thereby focusing on elastic scattering and andreev reflection but neglecting the proximity effect .",
    "these studies do predict some correct qualitative features of the junctions .",
    "the author of ref .",
    "remarks , and we agree , that only a proper consideration of the proximity effect through self - consistent methods will give the correct quantitative features as well . a self - consistent study@xcite relying on a 2-d tight binding model has been performed but only to study spatial variations of the spin and charge currents parallel to interface .",
    "therefore , there is a need for a fully self - consistent microscopic treatment of the conductance in sf bilayers to obtain quantitatively accurate results .    in this work",
    "we show how to numerically calculate conductances of sf bilayers using a fully self - consistent solution to the bogoliubov degennes ( bdg ) equations with a net current .",
    "we require a fully self - consistent solution to the bdg equations to properly treat clean inhomogeneous systems in three dimensions.@xcite we will analyze the resulting eigenfunctions , with proper boundary conditions , and generate transmission probabilities for particles scattered from f to s via the blonder - tinkham - klapwijk ( btk ) method.@xcite these transmission probabilities can then be used to calculate i - v curves , from which we will calculate the conductances .",
    "we find good qualitative agreement with experimental results , including an enhanced conductance at zero bias .",
    "we show that the fermi wavevector mismatch at the interface , the exchange field in the ferromagnet , and the interface barrier scattering all have a significant and independent effect on the shape of the conductance curves .",
    "this paper represents the early fruits of a completely new technique , which we expect will eventually be used to study more complicated geometries and conditions .",
    "our fully self - consistent solutions will allow for a very careful consideration of the influence of the proximity effect on the conductance , even for very thick f layers .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe in some detail our numerical methods and the procedures that we follow to extract the conductance as a function of applied voltage .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in detail in sect .",
    "a brief final section recapitulates our conclusions and points to future directions .",
    "the systems we study here are planar junctions made of sf bilayers with atomically smooth interfaces .",
    "we assume that the layers are semi - infinite in the directions perpendicular to the interfaces ( the @xmath1 directions ) .",
    "we will take the bands to be parabolic , thus @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the wavevector in the transverse direction and @xmath4 is the energy corresponding to the @xmath1 variables .",
    "the superconductor is assumed to be an @xmath5wave material .",
    "we use a numerical diagonalization of the microscopic bogoliubov - degennes@xcite equations for this inhomogeneous system . given a pair potential ( order parameter ) @xmath6 , to be determined self consistently , the spin - up quasi - particle ( @xmath7 ) and spin - down quasi - hole ( @xmath8 ) amplitudes obey the bdg equations :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a single - particle hamiltonian where @xmath11 is the contribution to the kinetic energy from motion in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the continuous variable @xmath4 is decoupled from the @xmath12 direction but of course it affects the eigenvalues @xmath13 , which are measured from the chemical potential .",
    "we describe the magnetism by an exchange field @xmath14 which takes the value @xmath15 in the f material and vanishes in s. within the superconducting layer , @xmath16 is equal to @xmath17 , the fermi energy of the s layers measured from the bottom of the band , while in the ferromagnet we have @xmath18 so that in the f regions the up and down band widths are @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively . as pointed out in ref .",
    ", one should not assume that @xmath21 and we therefore introduce the dimensionless fermi wavevector mismatch parameter @xmath22 .",
    "we also introduce the dimensionless magnetic strength variable @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25 limit corresponds to the `` half - metallic '' case .",
    "interfacial scattering is described by the potential @xmath26 which we take to be of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the location of the interface .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath29 ( everywhere in this paper @xmath30 ) conveniently characterizes the strength of the interfacial scattering .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be written down from symmetry relations.@xcite we will consider physically relevant values of @xmath33 , @xmath23 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we measure all lengths in terms of the inverse of @xmath35 , the fermi wavevector in the s material .",
    "the dimensionless f width in the @xmath12-dimension is @xmath36 , that of s is @xmath37 , and that of the entire sample is @xmath38 .",
    "the dimensionless spatial coordinates are denoted by @xmath39 .",
    "the pair potential @xmath40 must be found through the self - consistent condition : @xmath41    we will show that we can treat this problem as a plane wave scattering problem , with a scattering potential that exists over a finite region of space .",
    "the scattering potential is , of course , obtained through self - consistent methods .",
    "we will then look at the transmitted and reflected waves sufficiently far away from the interaction region that they , too , are plane waves.@xcite in this case , the spatial extent of the scattering potential is governed by the proximity effect .",
    "therefore , we must take the sample size large enough that the pair amplitude is zero over a large fraction of f , and it is approximately equal to its bulk value @xmath0 over a large fraction of s. we call these regions in which the pair amplitude is approximately constant the asymptotic regions .",
    "we must also take the total sample size to be very large so that the minimum wavevector in the problem , @xmath42 , allows us to approximate a continuum of incident plane waves . in principle",
    ", we should take the sample size to be infinite , but we must choose a finite value for computational considerations .",
    "we have taken a total sample size of sixty times the superconducting coherence length @xmath43 , which turned out to be sufficient to avoid finite size effects .",
    "the procedure for calculating conductances begins by using the bdg equations ( [ dgeq ] ) and the self consistency condition ( [ self ] ) to find a self - consistent order parameter for the system .",
    "we use a procedure similar to that in previous work.@xcite we start with a fully three dimensional wavefunction @xmath44 .",
    "the factor of @xmath45 contributes only @xmath46 , reducing this to a quasi-1d problem in the @xmath47-direction .",
    "we then expand the @xmath48 and @xmath49 eigenfunctions in a basis of both sines and cosines : @xmath50 where the @xmath51 signs in the left subindex refer to the sine or the cosine function respectively .",
    "this choice of basis is equivalent to using complex exponentials , but we gain some computational advantage in the very time consuming step of calculating a self - consistent pair amplitude by working with real rather than complex numbers for the time being .",
    "the wavevectors @xmath52 are defined in units of @xmath35 as : @xmath53 with @xmath54 being a positive integer .",
    "while the basis in principle requires all @xmath55 , in practice it is sufficient to chose a a cut - off large enough so that the largest wavevector in the problem corresponds to an energy that is a few @xmath56 above the fermi level .",
    "this choice of basis , which implies periodic boundary conditions as needed in this problem , allows for a wavefunction that is non - zero and has a non - zero first derivative at the boundaries , two necessary conditions for a non - zero current to be present .    in this basis , the upper left quadrant of the matrix in the left side of eqns .",

    "the non - self - consistent work@xcite assumes the scattering region to be infinitely small .",
    "the general outlines for the self - consistent and non - self - consistent treatments are similar .",
    "we will describe here first the salient features of the non - self - consistent treatment , and then discuss the changes necessary to study the self - consistent case .",
    "consider a single electron of spin @xmath64 in f with momentum @xmath65 , which is at an angle @xmath69 with the @xmath47-axis ( see [ fig : btk ] ) .",
    "this electron may be partially reflected from the interface as an electron with spin @xmath64 and a momentum of the same magnitude , but with the @xmath70 component in the opposite direction ( ordinary reflection ) .",
    "andreev reflection allows a single charge from f to create a cooper pair excitation in s without violating charge conservation . in this process ,",
    "when a single electron in spin band @xmath64 is incident on the interface , a hole is retro - reflected into opposite spin band , which we denote by @xmath68 , with momentum @xmath71 , and a cooper pair excitation is created in s. we write this as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 indicate the @xmath47-components of @xmath65 and @xmath71 , repectively .",
    "as noted above ( [ eq : basis ] ) , @xmath75 is conserved .",

    "similar equations can be written down for states with incident holes .",
    "we can use the @xmath77 and @xmath76 amplitudes to write down a formula for the conductance in the @xmath84 limit:@xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 accounts for the probability for the incident electron to have spin @xmath64,@xcite with @xmath87 for the spin - up band and @xmath88 for the spin - down band .",

    "the angularly averaged conductance is given by@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the angle of total reflection ( critical angle ) for incident particles of spin @xmath64 .",
    "this model has the usual features of plane wave scattering .",
    "the conservation of @xmath3 across the interface leads to a modified@xcite version of snell s law : @xmath96 and @xmath97 the incident and andreev reflected angles are respectively given by @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the transmitted angle @xmath100 is found through @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to a number of phenomena similar to those in electromagnetic wave scattering .",
    "in particular , the critical angle for ordinary reflection , which is given by @xmath102 , depends on the spin band of the incident electron .",
    "there is also an angle beyond which andreev reflection is no longer possible , given by @xmath103 .",
    "the foregoing discussion applies also to the non - self - consistent approach except that ( [ psif ] ) and ( [ psis ] ) are now possible only in the asymptotic regions far from the interface .",
    "the comments that follow are the steps necessary to analyze the self - consistent results . since there is no condition in the bdg equations to impose a net current traveling to the right the self - consistent spectrum of eigenfunctions would not be , in the asymptotic regions , in the convenient form of ( [ psif ] ) and ( [ psis ] ) even if we were to use a basis of complex exponentials .",
    "our choice of periodic boundary conditions allows us to impose the condition of a net current _ a posteriori_. this is very similar to the treatment given to one - dimensional scattering problems in elementary quantum mechanics . since a one - dimensional problem with periodic boundary conditions will produce two - fold degenerate solutions,@xcite this quasi - one - dimensional problem also has two - fold degenerate solutions .",
    "we can find a linear combination of each pair of degenerate solutions that corresponds to a particle injected into the s layer from the f layer .",
    "if we look in the f layer sufficiently far away from the interface ( in the asymptotic region ) , so that the pair amplitude has gone completely to zero , we find that the numerically calculated eigenfunctions can be fit to the form : @xmath104 similarly , in the asymptotic region of s , we find @xmath105    if we take a degenerate pair of solutions , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , they will have the same @xmath73 and @xmath74 but different @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 so that they are orthogonal .",

    "we find the zeros of the eigenfunction to get the characteristic wavenumber of the eigenfunction and assign it to the nearest multiple of @xmath118 .",
    "it is then a trivial step to obtain values for @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",

    "the exact value of the lower limit on the integral is not important because it will change the resulting value by a constant which will disappear when ( [ eq : gi ] ) is applied .",
