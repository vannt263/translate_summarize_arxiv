    "jets from radio - loud agn show two characteristic morphologies , associated with the fri and frii classes defined by @xcite .",
    "jets in fri sources ( e.g. , 3c  31 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) expand rapidly on kiloparsec scales , whereas those in the more powerful frii sources ( e.g. , cyg  a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are highly collimated until they terminate in compact hot - spots .",
    "fri and frii jets appear morphologically similar on parsec scales and both show evidence for relativistic speeds , although the former appear to be somewhat slower and to have significant velocity gradients @xcite .",
    "the current paradigm for fri jets is that , unlike frii jets , they are decelerated by entrainment of gas @xcite . whether this susceptibility to entrainment is solely a function of the power of the jet and its external environment or is due to a more fundamental difference is currently a matter of debate .",
    "two main processes have been invoked to explain entrainment in fri jets : ( i ) mixing in a turbulent shear layer between the jet and the ambient @xcite , and ( ii ) injection from stellar mass loss @xcite . concerning the process of entrainment through a turbulent shear layer , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pm07 ) showed , via a 2d axisymmetric simulation , that a recollimation shock in a light jet formed in reaction to steep interstellar density and pressure gradients may trigger nonlinear perturbations that lead to jet disruption and mixing with the external medium . @xcite and @xcite discussed the deceleration of fri jets at discontinuities in the ambient medium and by the growth of helical instabilities in a jet propagating through a homogeneous ambient medium , respectively .",
    "the influence of mass loading by stellar winds in fri jets was studied by @xcite , who showed that this problem can be treated as a hydrodynamical one , as the gyroradii of the particles are much smaller than the size of the interaction region between the jet and the stellar wind .",
    "thus , this problem can be reduced to that of a distributed source of mass that is injected into and thereafter advected with the jet flow .",
    "* hereafter blk ) studied the effect of mass loading by a typical stellar population on jets with different properties by solving the equations of evolution in steady state .",
    "in particular , they focused on light and hot electron / proton jets .",
    "they concluded that these jets can be efficiently decelerated by this mechanism , with some differences depending on the thermodynamical properties of the jets : hotter jets cool down due to entrainment of the cold wind particles , whereas relatively colder jets gain temperature in the entrainment region due to dissipation .",
    "@xcite studied the different ranges of stellar mass - loss rates and jet powers that could imply efficient jet deceleration within the host galaxy , and concluded that the stellar wind from a single wolf - rayet star could be enough to decelerate a weak fri jet .",
    "@xcite constructed a one - dimensional model of the jet in 3c  31 using the basic conservation laws and the velocity field inferred by @xcite , which includes a substantial deceleration of the jet within the flaring region , located at 13 kpc from the central engine .",
    "close to the outer boundary of this region , at @xmath1kpc , @xcite found maxima in the mass entrainment rate ( per unit length of the jet ) both for their reference model and for the stellar mass input .",
    "however , the latter is much smaller . although the expected mass injection by stellar winds seems to be enough to counterbalance the effects of adiabatic expansion and to keep the velocity fairly constant at the beginning of the flaring region , the continuous deceleration in the jet indicated by @xcite s results requires a monotonic increase of the entrainment rate at large distances",
    "this can not be the result of mass loss from stars , whose density falls rapidly with increasing radius .",
    "@xcite concluded that entrainment from the galactic atmosphere across the boundary layer of the jet is the dominant mass input process far from the nucleus in this powerful ( @xmath2ergs@xmath3 ) fri jet , but that stellar mass loss might also contribute near the flaring point .",
    "@xcite have recently presented observations and kinematic models for ten fri radio galaxies .",
    "they concluded that the deceleration of fri jets after the flaring point is a gradual process in which the transverse velocity profile evolves from constant to slower at the edges than on - axis .",
    "mass loading by stars is distributed throughout the jet volume and is therefore not expected to create large transverse velocity gradients .",
    "it is therefore unlikely to be the dominant cause of deceleration on these scales : boundary - layer entrainment is more plausible .",
    "a contribution from stellar mass loading , particularly on smaller scales , is not excluded , however .",
    "this conclusion was based on models for the six sources with adequately determined transverse velocity profiles .",
    "it is consistent with , but not required by the models for the remaining four .",
    "all of the cases with well - determined profiles are powerful fri sources .",
    "it remains possible that weaker sources such as m84 and ngc193 , for which the models do not show conclusive evidence for velocity gradients , are decelerated primarily by stellar mass loading .    in pm07 the deceleration and decollimation of the jet",
    "was produced by the development of a recollimation shock formed at a few kiloparsecs from the central engine due to the density decrease in the ambient igm .",
    "the expansion caused by the jet overpressure as it propagated outwards and the subsequent recollimation shock effectively decelerated the jet after the shock , triggering the development of kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) instabilities and enhancing the mass entrainment beyond this point .",
    "the main purposes of this paper are to extend the analysis of pm07 to include the combined effects of the mass loading of the jet by stellar winds and the recollimation shock , to compare with the earlier results and to cover a larger range of jet powers .",
    "we also investigate the effects of changing the boundary conditions of the simulations .",
    "we present simulations of jets with typical fri powers , including source terms in the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics that account for the mass entrainment by winds from the stellar populations expected for typical host galaxies .",
    "our aim is to understand the conditions under which fri jets can be decelerated by this type of entrainment and those for which either another process or a different stellar population are required .",

    "all of the simulated jets are purely leptonic and are injected at a distance from the galaxy nucleus of 80  pc with a radius @xmath31  pc .",
    "this assumes an opening angle of @xmath32 , consistent with recent estimates of the opening angles of parsec - scale fri jets @xcite .",
    "the ambient density at injection is @xmath33  g@xmath6 , and the ambient pressure is @xmath34  erg@xmath6 .",
    "we performed two simulations of jets with the same power as that in pm07 , but including mass loading .",
    "real jets are bipolar , but in order to save on computation time we have simulated only one side .",
    "this raises the question of the effect of the boundary conditions at injection .",
    "we have therefore made two simulations , identical except for the boundary conditions : _ powerful reflecting _ ( pr ) , for a reflecting condition at the injection boundary of the numerical box , and _ powerful open _ ( po ) , for an open boundary condition there .",
    "these simulations were designed to match as closely as possible the jet properties derived for 3c  31 @xcite , and the jets therefore have kinetic luminosities @xmath35 ergs@xmath3 , at the upper end of the power distribution for fri sources .",
    "although models po and pr have the same jet power as that studied in pm07 , they are simulated here for a shorter time ( @xmath360.25  myr instead of 7.3  myr ) and over a correspondingly shorter distance ( 2.2  kpc instead of 14.5  kpc ) .",
    "mass - loading terms are included , however .",
    "in pm07 , the injection of the jet into the numerical grid was done at 500  pc from the galactic nucleus , because the aim of the simulation was to study the long - term evolution . in this work , however , we are more interested in the influence of the mass loading of jets by stellar winds , so it is important to bring the injection point as close as possible to the centre of the galaxy , where the stellar density is highest . the initial cross - section must therefore be smaller ( 10  pc versus 60  pc in pm07 ) . in order to keep the same injection power as in pm07",
    ", this difference in cross - section has to be compensated , resulting in an initially faster , denser and more overpressured jet here than in pm07 .",
    "models po and pr have jet lorentz factor @xmath37 and jet to ambient density ratio @xmath38 at injection .",
    "they are significantly faster , denser and colder than the other simulated jets we discuss below .",
    "they are also more overpressured with respect to the ambient .",
    "the simulations of these models ( to be discussed below ) showed that the entrained mass is not high enough to decelerate the jets efficiently .",
    "we therefore ran a set of models ( a , a0 , b , c and d ) with powers 200 times smaller . reflecting boundary conditions were used in all cases .",
    "these model jets are relatively fast ( lorentz factor @xmath1 ) , light ( jet to ambient density ratio @xmath39 ) , hot ( specific internal energy @xmath40 ) and slightly underpressured with respect to the ambient ( as a result of fixing the jet density and temperature ) .",
    "the one - dimensional estimate for the jet advance speed is @xmath41 .",
    "model a0 , exactly the same as model a but without any mass entrainment , serves as a reference to identify the effects of the mass entrainment on the jet collimation and propagation .",
    "the parameters of these models were selected to fall within the range used by blk .",
    "the two - dimensional grid reproduces the ambient medium of an elliptical galaxy in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates . in the axial direction ,",
    "the grid starts at 80 pc from the galactic centre and typically ends at 2  kpc , depending on the simulation . in the transversal direction , a homogeneous grid ( with constant cell - size ) covers up to 1  kpc , and is expanded by an extra grid with geometrically increasing cell size from 1 to 2  kpc .",
    "the jet is injected into the numerical grid ( at 80  pc ) with radius @xmath42 .",
    "the numerical resolution is 16 cells across the jet radius at injection .",
    "this translates into a homogeneous grid size of @xmath43 cells ( transversal and axial , respectively ) .    for this work ,",
    "we have modified the equations of conservation of mass , momentum and energy in order to account for mass loading from stellar winds and external gravity .",
    "the conservation equations for a relativistic flow in two - dimensional cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath44 ) , assuming axisymmetry and using units in which @xmath45 , are : @xmath46 with the vector of unknowns @xmath47 fluxes @xmath48 @xmath49 and source terms @xmath50    the five unknowns @xmath51 and @xmath52 , refer to the densities of five conserved quantities , namely the total and leptonic rest masses , the radial and axial components of the momentum , and the energy ( excluding the rest mass energy ) .",
    "all five unknowns are defined in the laboratory frame , and are related to the quantities in the local rest frame of the fluid ( primitive variables ) according to : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the total and the leptonic rest - mass densities , respectively , @xmath59 are the components of the velocity of the fluid .",

    "quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 in the definition of the source - term vector @xmath68 , are the components of an external gravity force that keeps the atmosphere in equilibrium .",
    "the difference between these equations and those used in pm07 is just the inclusion of the source term related to mass loading by stellar winds .",
    "in the source - term vector , the subscript @xmath69 refers to the stellar wind and @xmath70 represents the mass - loading rate per unit volume defined by deprojecting the expression in equation  ( [ nuker ] ) , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the wind is taken to be a cold electron - proton gas entrained with negligible velocity compared to the jet .",

    "this is far enough to capture the effect of mass loading on jet flaring and disruption .",

    "processors were added as the jet evolved ( starting with 8 processors ) .",
    "these simulations required between @xmath80 and @xmath81 computational hours , depending on the model , resulting in a total of around @xmath82 hours .",
    "we first describe the effects resulting from the change of boundary conditions from open ( as used in pm07 ) to reflecting . reflecting",
    "boundary conditions mimic the presence of a counter - jet with the same properties as the simulated jet and are therefore likely to be more realistic .",
    "[ fig : po - pr ] shows the last frames of both simulations at @xmath83  yr .",
    "the images reveal the main differences due to the boundary condition : the shape of the bow - shock ( the forward shock driven into the ambient by the injection of the jet ) , the width of the jet and the prominence of jet pinching . in pr ,",
    "the reflecting boundary condition causes both the bow - shock and the inner cocoon ( the region with mixed shocked ambient and jet material surrounding the jet ) to be wider .",
    "the jet in po is broader and shows stronger recollimation ( conical ) shocks , which in turn make the head of the jet broader .",
    "the jet in pr remains more collimated .",
    "the choice of boundary condition only affects some aspects of the simulations .",
    "for example , the advance speeds of the jet terminal shock and the head of the bow - shock are very similar in pr and po , whereas the cocoon pressure and density in pr are larger : by almost an order of magnitude in the density ( @xmath84 compared with @xmath85  g  @xmath6 ) and a factor of two in the pressure ( @xmath86 compared with @xmath87  erg  @xmath6 ) by the end of the simulations . the pressure is basically determined by the injected energy divided by the volume of the shocked region , implying that the pressure in the shocked ambient and jet material ( i.e.  the whole volume within the bow - shock , excluding the jet ) will decrease with time as it expands .",
    "the pressure in the cocoon follows the same power - law @xmath88 in both cases , but with a larger constant of proportionality for pr .",
    "the radius of the bow - shock also increases faster with time for pr : by the end of the simulation the mean radius of the shocked region is @xmath89  pc compared with @xmath90  pc in po .",
    "another consequence of the higher pressure in pr is that the opening angle of the jet is smaller ( @xmath91 versus @xmath92 in po ) .",
    "the recollimation shocks are therefore stronger in po .",
    "po also shows a broader and faster backflow component than pr , since backflowing material can escape through the open boundary . in both simulations , the backflow decelerates with the distance travelled from the terminal shock .",
    "typical velocities close to the terminal shock ( @xmath93 ) are similar in both cases : @xmath94 in pr and @xmath95 in po . in pr",
    ", the velocity drops to values @xmath96 at @xmath97 and @xmath98 at @xmath99 , finally reaching zero at @xmath100 , close to the reflecting boundary . in po ,",
    "the backflow velocity is typically @xmath101 at @xmath102 and drops to values @xmath98 at @xmath100",
    ".    as the jet in both simulations has the same injection conditions , we expect that the jet and shock structures seen in pr and po should be very similar if they are compared at the same cocoon pressure .",
    "in other words , pr at a given time will look quite similar to po seen at some earlier time .",
    "in particular , the pressure in the cocoon has a direct influence on the position of a possible recollimation shock , and the appearance of strong shocks in simulations with reflecting boundaries will occur at later times than in simulations with open boundaries .",
    "we thus conclude that the shock in the jet in pm07 ( which used an open boundary ) would correspond to an older jet simulated with a reflecting boundary condition , in which the bow shock would have propagated to larger distances than the 15  kpc found in that work",
    ".    as the use of a reflecting boundary condition is likely to give a better approximation to the true bipolar case , we use it for the remaining simulations in this paper .",
    "the differences introduced by the change of boundary conditions should be borne in mind when comparing with the simulations of pm07 .",

    "[ fig : po - pr],scaledwidth=45.0% ]        neither of the simulations of powerful , mass - loaded jets show signs of strong deceleration over distances of 2kpc , but there is slow deceleration due to a combination of mass loading and dissipation of kinetic energy at internal shocks .",
    "the jet flow heats up at the shocks , increasing its temperature by an order of magnitude ( to @xmath103k ) between injection and the terminal shock .",
    "the role of mass loading is revealed by a decrease in the jet mass fraction from 1 to around 0.9 on the axis ( slightly larger for pr and smaller for po ) and a decrease in the mean value over the jet cross section to about 0.6 before the jet terminal shock in both simulations .",
    "the mean jet flow velocity before the terminal shock is around 80% of the injection value .",
    "the jet can only be slowed efficiently by mass loading when the kinetic energy required to accelerate the loaded mass to the flow velocity of the jet ( @xmath104 per unit time , where @xmath105 is the jet lorentz factor , and @xmath106 is the mass - loading rate ) is of the order or larger than the kinetic luminosity , @xmath107 @xcite . if we assume a constant mass - loading rate per unit volume @xmath70 and a jet of constant radius @xmath108 , the characteristic length for jet deceleration is @xmath109 even if we use a constant mass - loading rate equal to the maximum at the centre of the galaxy , @xmath110 ( table  [ tab1 ] ) , we still obtain deceleration lengths of the order of hundreds of kpc .",
    "such values are only indicative , since : ( i ) part of the jet kinetic energy will be used to heat the loaded material ; ( ii ) the mass loaded per unit time rises as the jet gets longer and ( iii ) the true value of the mass - loading rate per unit volume decreases very fast with increasing distance from the galaxy centre ( for @xmath111 in our models ) , so the approximation @xmath112 is only valid over distances @xmath1131kpc . whereas ( i ) and ( ii ) tend to decrease the deceleration length , ( iii ) tends to increase it .",
    "nevertheless , this simple computation clearly explains the lack of deceleration in models po and pr within the first 2kpc .",
    "it is interesting to compare po and pr with the simulation presented in pm07 ( which has the same boundary condition as po ) .",

    "the first recollimation shock appeared at @xmath116 after @xmath117 .",
    "the jet was injected close to the core radius of the galactic gas , and thus expanded into an ambient medium in which the density and pressure fall rapidly with distance . within this environment",
    "the pressure of the cocoon evolves as @xmath118 . in the case of po and pr ,",
    "the simulations covered much smaller durations ( @xmath119 ) and distances from the nucleus than that in pm07 .",
    "the cocoon pressure evolves following a flatter slope @xmath120 , primarily because the jets in po and pr are entirely within the galactic core , where the ambient density falls very slowly with distance .",
    "this results in a slower expansion : the jets in po and pr would need to be followed to larger distances and times to be directly compared with the simulation in pm07 .",

    "[ fig : a0final ] shows the distributions of pressure , rest - mass density , temperature and axial flow velocity at the end of the simulation .",

    "a0 , the region is quite broad with no substantial enhancement of the internal energy density ( fig .",

    "the dynamics of the jet head is discussed in more detail in section  [ ss : head_dyn ] .",
    "the cocoon is essentially isobaric , since the time - scale for the pressure to become constant is much shorter than the propagation time - scale .",
    "the density and temperature distributions display a clear transition between the almost homogeneous values of the old jet material in the cocoon ( made colder and denser due to mixing with the shocked ambient gas through the contact discontinuity ) and the hot and dilute material newly injected at the nose cone .",
    "finally , a hot shear layer develops between the beam and cocoon material ( this is not seen in the temperature panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : a0final ] due to its limited resolution ) .",
    "we emphasize that the end - points of all of the simulations presented here correspond to very early stages of the evolution of low - power radio galaxies .",

    "the hot cocoons will dilute and mix with the cooler ambient material as the jet becomes transonic and the bow shock disappears .",
    "the spherical shape that we find for the cocoon close to the injection is due to the low advance velocity of the head of the jet and the action of gravity : the dynamical time - scale of the gravitational field that maintains the atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium is in the range @xmath122 to @xmath123 in the simulated region ; this is smaller than the simulation time , where @xmath124 is the gravitational constant and @xmath125 is the density of dark matter within the simulated region . ] .",

    "the times of the snapshots in figs  [ fig : a0sequence ] and [ fig : asequence ] are almost identical , allowing a direct comparison of the density panels for the two models .",
    "the main structural and dynamical features of the cocoon / shocked ambient system found in model a0 ( an almost spherical cocoon , detachment of the bow shock from the cocoon and formation of a nose cone at the head of the jet ) also apply to model a. comparison between the two sequences also shows very similar speeds for the propagation of the jet head and the expansion of the cocoon .",
    "these similarities persist until the ends of the simulations ( figs  [ fig : a0final ] and [ fig : afinal ] ) .",
    "the reasons for them are discussed in section  [ ss : cocoon ] .",
    "however , qualitative differences in the evolution of a0 and a appear as a result of the accumulated effect of mass loading .",
    "in particular , the mass loading causes an efficient deceleration of the plasma within the beam in model a , which leads to expansion .",

    "our models a , b and c all show deceleration , as do the hot and cold reference models of blk , with the former having a shorter stopping distance ( their figs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "model d , by comparison , shows little deceleration .",
    "the bulk parameters governing the propagation of the jets in our simulations are similar to those of blk , but differences are expected from the disparity in the composition and thermodynamic properties between the models and from the natures of the two kinds of simulation .",
    "our jets are composed of electron - positron pairs ; those of blk contain electron - proton plasma .",

    "they are , however , restricted to the early evolutionary phases of fri radio sources .      the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the shocked ambient and cocoon in models a , b , c , d and a0 are all very similar .",
    "the explanation is that all of the models have the same kinetic power and thrust ( @xmath133 dyn ) and propagate through the same ambient medium , so the differences between their gross dynamical properties are small .",
    "[ fig : cavity_evol ] shows the evolution of the length and width of the shocked region with time for all of the models .",

    "although limited in duration , our simulations allow us to study the principal effects of mass loading on the beam evolution because the jet head is followed out to a distance of @xmath77  kpc , well beyond the stellar break radius @xmath134  pc .",
    "the internal structure of the jets is dominated by oblique shocks ( conical shocks in axisymmetric models ) .",
    "their origin is the pressure mismatch between the beam and its surroundings ( i.e. , the cocoon ) and this produces periodic variations of the beam structure around some state of equilibrium .",
    "the wavelength of these variations is given approximately by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the relativistic mach number and @xmath137 is the beam radius @xcite . at the incident shock ,",
    "the beam flow recollimates and decelerates whereas at the reflected shock , the flow is first compressed and then expands and accelerates , helped by the pressure gradient in the post - shock gas .",
    "the expansion continues until the pressure drops below the ambient value , when a new incident shock is initiated .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] shows a sketch of a conical shock .",
    "if the initial jet overpressure is large or the fall in the ambient pressure is steep enough , the shock can produce a planar mach disk , as observed in pm07 .",
    "the series of oblique shocks left behind by the jet head is present in all of the models but is especially prominent in models a0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a0final ] ) and d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dfinal ] ) .",
    "it is apparently unaffected by the small amount of mass loading in the latter case . in the more heavily mass loaded models",
    "a , b and c , the internal shocks are weaker ( and the amplitudes of the pressure jumps are therefore smaller than in models a0 or d )",
    ".    a simple analysis of the beam properties can be done by assuming stationarity from the injection point to the terminal shock .",
    "this is a fair assumption as long as the beam remains supersonic ( which is certainly the case up to the terminal shock ) and the injection boundary conditions and the mass loading are also stationary .",
    "the external pressure around the jet ( the cocoon pressure ) is quite homogeneous and varies slowly with time .",
    "the evolution of the averages across the beam of different relevant quantities along the axial direction can then be evaluated . to this end , the beam is defined as the domain encompassing all of the plasma with axial velocity larger than @xmath138 . the radius of this region is plotted against axial distance , @xmath139 , in fig .  [",
    "fig : beam_mean_values](a ) .",
    "the value of @xmath138 represents a compromise that gives a well - defined beam profile up to the terminal shock at the cost of including a fraction of cocoon material accelerated by shear at the beam / cocoon surface in the analysis .",
    "as noted in section  [ ss : modelbc ] , the beam profiles are remarkably similar for models a , b and c. this is primarily a consequence of mass loading dominating the beam structure , with the detailed thermodynamics of the different beam models playing a secondary role .",
    "the beam radius profile in model d remains close to that of model a0 and this confirms that the mass - load rate in model d is not strongly affecting the dynamics of the jet .",
    "the primary effect of mass loading on the beam is the deceleration and cooling of the flow as a result of the momentum transfer from the original beam fluid to the newly incorporated material and the reduction of the mean specific internal energy .",
    "figs  [ fig : beam_mean_values](b ) and ( c ) show , respectively , the averages of the flow velocity and the specific internal energy across the beam as functions of axial distance for models a , a0 , b , c and d at the end of the simulations .",
    "the deceleration of the beam flow in models a , b and c is clear . despite the differences in initial specific internal energy and density ( two orders of magnitude between the extreme cases ) , the deceleration rate in these models is roughly the same",
    "this is because these initial values have been chosen so that all three models have the same initial internal energy per unit volume and the same thrust ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the density profiles are dominated by stellar mass input ( except very close to the injection point ) and are also very similar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_mean_values]e ) .",
    "the deceleration rate depends on the initial momentum of the beam and the mass - loading rate , which are both the same in all three models .",
    "similarly , the models all have the same amount of internal energy to share with the cooler stellar wind plasma , so the profiles of specific internal energy along the beam are also almost identical . we conclude that the dissipation of kinetic energy into internal energy along the beam is essentially the same in all three mass - loaded models .",
    "finally , the similarity of the velocity and specific internal energy profiles implies that the relativistic beam mach number , @xmath136 must vary in the same way for models a , b and c. it adjusts during the first @xmath140 pc after the injection to a value around @xmath141 , thereafter decreasing along the beam ( fig .",

    "the average flow velocity of the beam is @xmath142 , reduced by @xmath143 from its value of @xmath144 at injection .",
    "the density however increases by a factor of @xmath145 since the shear layer material included in the jet by our definition ( cells with axial velocity larger than @xmath138 ) dominates the average .",
    "the opposite happens in the case of the specific internal energy , which is several orders of magnitude larger in the beam than in the cocoon .",
    "the average is dominated by the beam and shows a reduction of about @xmath146 from the injection value .",
    "increasing the velocity cut - off in the definition of the beam reduces the beam radius and produces averages closer to the values at injection .",
    "a comparison between the density profiles for models a0 and a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beam_mean_values]e ) , confirms that mass loading by stellar winds dominates over that from shear entrainment in models a , b and c ( but not in d ) .",
    "we also note that the plasma in all of our models cools down along the jets because our jets are initially thermodynamically hot .",
    "this cooling is most pronounced in models a , b and c and least in a0 , with d being intermediate between them .",
    "thus , the effect of thermal dilution between the original beam plasma and the entrained stellar wind plasma dominates over the heating produced by dissipation .",
    "this is not what happens in some of the cases considered by blk , notably their ` cold ' reference model .",
    "we can gain more insight into the behaviour of the jet radius and internal density from the constraints set by mass conservation and pressure balance .",

    "hence , the product @xmath150 must grow fast enough to balance the deceleration and still give a positive derivative in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cont_steady ] ) . as a result , @xmath57 , @xmath148 or both must increase along the beam .",
    "the pressure in the beam is governed by pressure balance with the cocoon .",

    "[ fig : beam_mean_values]e ) . in practice ,",
    "both @xmath57 and @xmath148 increase to ensure pressure equilibrium and to satisfy the equation of continuity .",
    "note that beam expansion leads to further mass loading , which in turn leads to further deceleration and cooling .",
    "the final result is an effective deceleration of the jet head in models a , b and c , and associated decollimation and flaring of the jet beyond this point ( see section  [ ss : head_dyn ] ) . on the other hand , the triggering of this runaway process occurs only for high enough mass - loading rates : model d ( with a mass - loading rate only one order of magnitude lower than that of models a , b and c ) evolves in essentially the same way as the unloaded model a0 .",

    "moreover , at low values of @xmath135 , the simple supersonic scaling breaks down and growth lengths drop rapidly .",
    "thus , we conclude that the main cause of the relative increase in the growth rates and the earlier disruption of the jets in models a , b and c is the deceleration of the flow compared with that in a0 and d.    in order to quantify the further deceleration after jet disruption , fig .  [",

    "our simulations show that , although mass load by stellar winds produces an expansion of the jet and a wide shear - layer , the inner region of the jet preserves a flat transverse velocity profile until the jet is disrupted .",
    "profiles at 80 and 540pc for models a and b show this effect clearly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity_profiles ] ) .",
    "after disruption , the transverse profiles become centrally peaked , but here the deceleration is primarily due to interactions with the ambient medium rather than to stellar mass loading , and the profiles are therefore similar ( although with higher central values ) for models a0 and d , which have zero and low mass loading , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity_profiles ] ) .",
    "another interesting difference observed between the simulations with and without mass loading relates to the backflow , with models a , b and c showing small backflow velocities , @xmath160c , whereas models a0 and d show regions with velocities @xmath161c .",
    "the cause of this difference is related to the strength of the terminal shock , which ultimately depends on the flow velocity immediately upstream of the shock .",

    "there must be a range of variation between individual galaxies , depending on the precise stellar distribution and population , but the basic result should be robust .",
    "a corollary is that low - power fri jets can not be magnetically dominated on kiloparsec scales : the stellar mass loading will completely change the nature of the outflow within a few hundred pc .",

    "these sources of mass input may be able to decelerate more powerful jets , and should be investigated in future simulations .",
    "recollimation shocks ( section  [ ss : beam ] ) result from the response of the jet to a large pressure imbalance with its surroundings and have been studied in the context of the collimation and structure of extragalactic jets in both classical @xcite and relativistic regimes @xcite .",
    "if the jet is instead under - pressured or only slightly over - pressured with respect to the environment , small amplitude pinching will be induced , as observed in models a0 and d. this pinching could then couple to a kh unstable mode and grow with distance , triggering mixing and deceleration .",
    "the spatial scale at which this process develops depends on the jet and ambient properties but , in general , will be longer than the kiloparsec scale .",
    "the most interesting case is , however , when a recollimation shock reflects on the axis in a mach reflection rather than a regular reflection . in this case ,",
    "a planar mach disk shock is formed , decelerating the flow very efficiently and leading to a subsonic flow in the shock rest frame .",
    "based on the significant overpressure at the flaring point in their models for 3c31 , @xcite proposed that the flaring point is associated with a stationary shock system , even though efficient mach disks are only formed for jets with opening angles much larger than the 8.5@xmath166 found by @xcite for the inner region of 3c  31 . in pm07 ,",
    "the authors tested such a possibility based on axisymmetric numerical simulations of the 3c  31 jet and environment .",
    "three small mach disks were produced within the 2kpc length of the flaring region in the model jet .",
    "although the jet simulated in pm07 was injected with a large overpressure factor of 7.8 compared with the ambient , jets generate their own environment ( the cocoon ) , which is also overpressured .",
    "the jet was in fact only marginally overpressured with respect to its immediate surroundings and had a relatively small 13.8@xmath166 opening angle close to injection .",
    "nevertheless , the series of recollimation shocks was able to decelerate the flow to subsonic speeds .    with the caveats noted in section  [ intro ] , kinematic models of fri jets @xcite imply that deceleration from @xmath167 to sub - relativistic speeds is a fairly gradual process , involving the development of transverse velocity gradients and therefore associated with instabilities and boundary - layer entrainment .",
    "this leaves open the question of whether recollimation shocks provide the initial trigger for deceleration .",
    "the high - resolution observations summarized by @xcite present a challenge to the idea that deceleration is initiated by recollimation shocks , at least in the two best - resolved cases , 3c296 and ngc315 ( their fig .",
    "17d and i ) .",
    "firstly , neither of these jets show bright features crossing the jets at the start of their flaring regions that might plausibly be identified with strong reconfinement shocks .",
    "instead , the brightness enhancements in the flaring region are complex , non - axisymmetric and restricted to the central parts of the jets .",
    "secondly , the expansion rates of the jets increase monotonically with distance after the flaring point , with no sign of recollimation until much larger distances . on the other hand ,",
    "the bright knot at the base of the flaring region in 3c31 ( * ? ? ? * their fig .",
    "17e ) could still plausibly be associated with a recollimation shock .",
    "higher - resolution observations are needed to decide whether such shocks are present in fri jets .",
    "another option considered to explain the deceleration of the flow is the development of instabilities that grow to nonlinear amplitudes and could give rise to the flaring of emission .",
    "@xcite suggested that the growing modes have to be high - order because the observed jets flare without disruption .",
    "all that is really necessary , however , is that they have short wavelengths .",
    "the process of slow deceleration could , instead , be related to the type 2 unstable flows ( ust2 ) classified by @xcite .",
    "these occupy a characteristic location in the relativistic mach number - lorentz factor plane and were confirmed using three - dimensional simulations by @xcite .",
    "this type of deceleration corresponds to a slow and progressive mixing , expansion and deceleration of jets that is caused by short - wavelength , but low - order , body modes .",
    "@xcite showed that this mechanism can be relevant in hot jets , because the linear solutions give high growth - rates and short wavelengths for the resonant values of kh body - modes , as opposed to the solutions obtained for colder jets .",
    "interestingly , @xcite conclude that the jets in their sample could be formed by hot , low - mach - number flows .",
    "further work is needed to establish whether this mechanism is effective for the parameter range applicable to fri jets .",
    "the resolution used in our simulations is not high enough to allow for the development of short - wavelength unstable modes .",
    "however , the goal of this paper is to determine the range of jet powers over which mass - loading by stars could be relevant .",
    "our simulations allow us to achieve this goal and also to demonstrate the development of longer wavelength unstable modes .",
    "a detailed study to compare the effects of the growth of short - wavelength modes and mass - loading by stars would require specific high - resolution simulations .",
    "it is important to note that the growth of instabilities from the linear regime requires pressure equilibrium with the ambient : if the jet is overpressured and expands , the expansion dominates the interaction between the jet and the ambient , making it difficult for a growing instability to become dynamically important .",
    "in addition , the wavelength of the fastest - growing modes changes proportionally to the jet radius and the growth rates are reduced ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "+     +    we stress that our simulations have followed the evolution of the propagating jets for @xmath168  yr after they are initiated .",
    "although we believe that the simulations capture several important aspects of jet propagation , the resulting morphologies are very different from those observed in old fri sources .",
    "although the head of the jet in the decelerated models advances at a very low velocity by the end of the simulation , the shape and structure of the cocoon are likely to change radically when the bow - shock expands in the strong pressure gradient beyond the galactic core .",
    "the spherical structure observed around the injection region is expected to cool and become denser as the surrounding material falls back towards the galactic centre and is entrained across the contact discontinuity .",
    "this spherical cocoon might be observable in young , low - power radio sources , but it is likely to disappear at later times due to mixing with the colder and denser material that surrounds it .",
    "three - dimensional , long - term simulations should be performed to study the transition between the early stage studied here and the evolution of the whole structure when the bow - shock propagates out of the galactic core and becomes transonic .",
    "we have performed a series of axisymmetric simulations of the early evolution ( up to @xmath169  yr ) of fri jets in a realistic galactic environment to investigate the effects of mass loading by stellar winds .",
    "the simulations presented here allow us to capture the effects of mass loading on beam evolution within the host galaxy and are precise enough to discriminate between models differing by a factor of ten in the mass entrainment rate .",
    "our results are consistent with previous steady state simulations ( blk ) and theoretical estimates @xcite .",
    "the overall structure and dynamics of the cocoon - shocked ambient system is very similar for all models with the same power and thrust .",
    "slight differences in long - term evolution result from differences in the dynamics of the jet head ( which are affected by the mass loading ) .",
    "the mass load carried by the beam affects its internal structure ( internal shocks , pinching , beam radius and jet opening angle ) and properties ( increase in the rest mass density , cooling and deceleration ) .",
    "we find that mass entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar mass loss in elliptical galaxies lead to deceleration of the beam plasma and effective decollimation of weak ( @xmath170 ) fri jets on scales of about 1 kpc .",
    "deceleration is accompanied by expansion and , in axisymmetric simulations , the development of disruptive pinch modes that lead to the decollimation and further deceleration of the jet due to external entrainment .",
    "the composition of the jet is also completely changed by the process of mass loading , ruling out a dominant magnetic field on kiloparsec scales in low - power fri jets .",
    "however , stellar mass loading seems to be unable to decelerate the most powerful ( @xmath171 ) fri jets . in these powerful jets , the formation of strong recollimation shocks when the pressure in the environment drops well below that of the jet or continuous mass entrainment produced by short - wavelength kh body modes ,",
    "are more plausible mechanisms for deceleration , entrainment and mixing ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "future work should include high - resolution three - dimensional simulations to allow for a detailed comparison between the different proposed mechanisms of deceleration .",
    "our conclusions can also be tested observationally by modelling larger samples of weak and powerful fri jets using the techniques developed by @xcite .",
    "we would expect transverse velocity gradients to develop in the powerful jets , but the weak jets should maintain their initial transverse velocity profiles as they decelerate .",

    "<S> jets in low - luminosity radio galaxies are known to decelerate from relativistic speeds on parsec scales to mildly or sub - relativistic speeds on kiloparsec scales . </S>",
    "<S> several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect , including strong reconfinement shocks and the growth of instabilities ( both leading to boundary - layer entrainment ) and mass loading from stellar winds or molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a series of axisymmetric simulations of the early evolution of jets in a realistic ambient medium to probe the effects of mass loading from stellar winds using the code _ _ r__atpenat . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of fanaroff - riley class i ( fri ) jets , with kinetic powers @xmath0 , within the first 2  kpc of their evolution , where deceleration by stellar mass loading should be most effective . </S>",
    "<S> mass entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar mass loss in elliptical galaxies produce deceleration and effective decollimation of weak fri jets within the first kiloparsec . </S>",
    "<S> however , powerful fri jets are not decelerated significantly . in those cases where the mass loading is important , </S>",
    "<S> the jets show larger opening angles and decollimate at smaller distances , but the overall structure and dynamics of the bow - shock are similar to those of unloaded jets with the same power and thrust . according to our results , the flaring observed on kpc scales is initiated by mass loading in the weaker fri jets and by reconfinement shocks or the growth of instabilities in the more powerful jets . </S>",
    "<S> the final mechanism of decollimation and deceleration is always the development of disruptive pinching modes .    </S>",
