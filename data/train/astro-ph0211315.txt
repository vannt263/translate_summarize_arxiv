    "it has long been known that in a strong magnetic field even the vacuum has a nontrivial dielectric property ; this is the result of vacuum polarization , a genuine quantum electrodynamics effect ( heisenberg & euler 1936 ; schwinger 1951 ; adler 1971 ; tsai & erber 1975 ; heyl & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "this effect is usually negligible for @xmath1 , but becomes increasingly important when @xmath2 exceeds @xmath3 , where @xmath4  g is the magnetic field at which the electron cyclotron energy @xmath5 equals @xmath6 .",
    "a number of studies in the late 1970s showed that vacuum polarization can affect radiative transfer in magnetized plasmas by modifying photon polarization modes and inducing features in the radiative opacities ( gnedin , pavlov & shibanov 1978a , b ; meszaros & ventura 1978,1979 ; pavlov & shibanov 1979 ; ventura , nagel & meszaros 1979 ; see pavlov & gnedin 1984 and meszaros 1992 for review ) .",
    "these earlier studies were mostly applied to radio pulsars and accreting x - ray binaries , for which @xmath1 .",
    "not surprisingly , the effect of vacuum polarization in these systems appears to be relatively minor and , as far as we know , no concrete observational manifestation of vacuum polarization has been identified .    in the last few years",
    ", soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) have been identified as a potentially new class of neutron stars ( nss ) endowed with superstrong ( @xmath7  g ) magnetic fields , the so - called `` magnetars '' ( see thompson & duncan 1996 ; hurley 2000 ; thompson 2001 ; israel et al 2001 )",
    ". this has stimulated new studies on radiative processes in the superstrong magnetic field regime .",
    "of particular relevance to the present paper is the detection of _ thermal _ x - rays from the surface of isolated magnetic nss ( see pavlov et al .",
    "2002 for a recent review ) , including five magnetar candidates ( 4 axps and one sgr ; see , e.g. , patel et al .",
    "2001 ; juett et al .",
    "2002 ; tiengo et al .",
    ". the thermal emission can potentially provide useful constraints on the interior physics , surface magnetic field and composition of nss .",
    "several recent works have begun to model the atmosphere emission from magnetars , including the effect of vacuum polarization ( bezchastnov et al .",

    "previous theoretical modeling of magnetic ns atmospheres ( see ho & lai 2003 and references therein ; see also pavlov et al .",
    "1995 ; zavlin & pavlov 2002 for reviews ) are based on solving the transfer equations for the two photon modes . as we discuss and quantify in  2 and  3 below",
    ", this modal description of the radiative transport is , in general , inadequate to handle the vacuum polarization effect near the `` vacuum resonance '' where the modes can mix and even `` collapse '' .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to clarify these issues and to derive general transfer equations that can be used to study the transport of polarized radiation in the superstrong field regime .",
    "section 2 contains a physical discussion of the vacuum polarization effect on radiative transfer in magnetized ns atmospheres . in  3 , we derive the basic properties of photon modes in magnetized plasmas and quantify the limitation of the modal description of radiative transport .",
    "we then study in  4 and  5 the propagation of polarized photons in an inhomogeneous plasma .",
    "we derive in  6 the transfer equations for the photon intensity matrix and conclude in  7 .",
    "to motivate our quantitative study in  3-6 , we present a physical discussion of the effect of vacuum polarization on radiative transfer in strong magnetic fields and on the thermal spectra of magnetars",
    "( see lai & ho 2002a ; ho & lai 2003 ; hereafter lh02 and hl03 ) .",
    "this also serves to clarify some of the confusions that have appeared recently ( see lai & ho 2002b ) . in a highly magnetized ns atmosphere , both",
    "the plasma and vacuum polarization contribute to the dielectric property of the medium .",
    "a `` vacuum resonance '' arises when these two contributions `` compensate '' each other ( gnedin et al .",

    "for a photon of energy @xmath8 , the vacuum resonance occurs at the density _ v0.964y_e^-1b_14 ^",
    "2e_1 ^ 2 f^-2  g  cm^-3 , [ eq : densvp ] where @xmath9 is the electron fraction , @xmath10 , @xmath11  g is the magnetic field strength , and @xmath12 is a slowly varying function of @xmath2 and is of order unity ( lh02 and hl03 ) . for @xmath13 ( where the plasma effect dominates the dielectric tensor ) and @xmath14 ( where vacuum polarization dominates ) ,",
    "the photon modes ( for @xmath8 much smaller than the electron cyclotron energy @xmath15 ) are almost linearly polarized ( see fig .  3 below ) : the extraordinary mode ( x - mode ) has its electric field vector @xmath16 perpendicular to the @xmath17-@xmath18 plane , while the ordinary mode ( o - mode ) is polarized along the @xmath17-@xmath19 plane ( where @xmath17 specifies the direction of photon propagation , @xmath19 is the unit vector along the magnetic field ) . near @xmath20 , however , the normal modes become circularly polarized as a result of the `` cancellation '' of the plasma and vacuum effects  both effects tend to make the mode linearly polarized , but in mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "when a photon propagates in an inhomogeneous medium , its polarization state will evolve adiabatically if the density variation is sufficiently gentle .",
    "thus , a x - mode ( o - mode ) photon will be converted into a o - mode ( x - mode ) as it traverses the vacuum resonance ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "this resonant mode conversion is analogous to the msw effect of neutrino oscillation ( e.g. , haxton 1995 ) . for this conversion to be effective",
    ", the adiabatic condition must be satisfied : & & ee_ad(b,_b , h _ ) + & & = 1.49(f_b |1-u_i|)^2/3 ( 5cmh_)^1/3  kev , [ condition]where @xmath21 is the angle between @xmath22 and @xmath18 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the ion cyclotron energy , and @xmath25 is the density scale height ( evaluated at @xmath20 ) along the ray . for an ionized hydrogen atmosphere , @xmath26  cm , where @xmath27  k is the temperature , @xmath28  cm  s@xmath29 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath30 is the angle between the ray and the surface normal .",
    "we note that in this paper [ as in our previous papers ( lh02 , hl03 ) , and in several other references such as meszaros & ventura ( 1979 ) , meszaros ( 1992 , p.  94 ) , etc . ]",
    ", we refer to the o - mode as the mode with @xmath31 and the x - mode as the mode with @xmath32 ( here the @xmath33-axis is along @xmath17 and the @xmath34-axis is in the direction of @xmath35 ) , thus the name `` mode conversion '' .",
    "alternatively , one can define modes with definite helicity ( the sign of @xmath36 ) such that @xmath37 changes continuously as @xmath38 changes ; we call these plus - mode and minus - mode ( see  3 ) .",
    "thus we may also say that in the adiabatic limit , the photon will remain in the same plus or minus branch , but the character of the mode is changed across the vacuum resonance . indeed , in the literature on radio wave propagation in plasmas ( e.g. , budden 1961 ; zheleznyakov et al .  1983 ) , the nonadiabatic case , in which the photon state jumps across the continuous curves , is referred to as `` linear mode coupling '' .",
    "it is important to note that the `` mode conversion '' effect discussed here is not a matter of semantics .",
    "the key point is that in the adiabatic limit , the photon polarization ellipse changes its orientation across the vacuum resonance , and therefore the photon opacity changes significantly .",
    "field along @xmath19 ( for most directions of propagation except when @xmath17 is nearly parallel to @xmath19 ) , and therefore the o - mode opacity is close to the @xmath39 value , while the x - mode opacity is much smaller . ]",
    "we prefer to use the term `` mode conversion '' since it captures this essential feature important for radiative transfer , and it is analogous to the msw effect and other quantum mechanics problems involving adiabatic evolution of quantum states ( landau 1932 ; zener 1932 ) .    because the two photon modes have vastly different opacities , the vacuum polarization - induced mode conversion can significantly affect radiative transfer in magnetar atmospheres . the main effect of vacuum polarization on the atmosphere spectrum can be understood as follows .",
    "when the vacuum polarization effect is neglected , the decoupling densities of the o - mode and x - mode photons ( i.e. , the densities of their respective photospheres ) are approximately given by ( for hydrogen plasma ) @xmath40  g  @xmath41 and @xmath42  g  @xmath41 ( see lh02 ) , where @xmath43 .",
    "the vacuum resonance lies between these two photospheres when @xmath44 , i.e. b_l < b < b_h , where & & b_l6.610 ^ 13f t_6 ^ -1/8e_1 ^ -1/4g^-1/4  g , + & & b_h5.110 ^ 16 f^2t_6 ^ -1/4e_1 ^ -3/2g^-1/2  g. when this condition is satisfied , the effective decoupling depths of the photons are changed the vacuum resonance lies deeper than the photospheres of both modes , while for @xmath45 the resonance lies outside both photospheres . in both cases , the effect of vacuum polarization on the radiative spectrum",
    "is expected to be small , although in the latter case ( @xmath45 ) , the polarization of the emitted photons will be modified by the vacuum resonance . ] .",
    "indeed , we see from fig .  2 that mode conversion makes the effective decoupling density of x - mode photons ( which carry the bulk of the thermal energy ) smaller , thereby depleting the high - energy tail of the spectrum and making the spectrum closer to black - body ( although the spectrum is still harder than black - body because of nongrey opacities ) .",
    "this expectation is borne out in self - consistent atmosphere modeling presented in hl03 .",
    "another important effect of vacuum polarization on the spectrum , first noted in hl03 , is the suppression of proton cyclotron lines ( and maybe other spectral lines ; see also ho et al .",
    "the physical origin for such line suppression is related to the depletion of continuum flux , which makes the decoupling depths inside and outside the line similar .",
    "hl03 suggests that the absence of lines in the observed spectra of several axps may be an indication of the vacuum polarization effect at work in these systems .",
    "our previous study ( lh02 ) on the vacuum - induced mode conversion did not explicitly take into account of the effect of dissipation on the mode structure .",
    "although this dissipative effect is small under many situations , near the vacuum resonance and for some directions of propagation , the two photon modes can `` collapse '' , i.e. , they become identical and hence nonorthogonal ( soffel et al .",
    "1983 ; see also pavlov & shibanov 1979 ) .",
    "the analysis of lh02 breaks down near these `` mode collapse '' points ( see  3 ) .",
    "the question therefore arises as to how the polarization state evolves as the photon travels near the mode collapse point .",
    "also , as mentioned in  1 , previous studies of ns atmospheres with strong magnetic fields rely on the modal description of the radiative transport .",
    "this is valid only in the limit of large faraday depolarization ( gnedin & pavlov 1974 ) , which is not always satisfied near the vacuum resonance especially for superstrong field strengths ( see  3 ) .",
    "more importantly , the transfer equations based on normal modes can not handle the cases in which partial mode coupling ( conversion ) occurs across the vacuum resonance ( i.e. , when the adiabatic condition is neither strongly satisfied or violated ) . clearly , to properly account for the effects of mode collapse , breakdown of faraday depolarization , and mode conversion associated with vacuum polarization",
    ", one must go beyond the modal description of the radiation field by formulating and solving the transfer equation in terms of the photon intensity matrix ( or stokes parameters ) and including the birefringence of the plasma - vacuum medium ( see  5 and  6 ) .",
    "the property of photon modes in a magnetized electron - ion plasma including vacuum polarization was studied in lh02 and hl03 ( see also meszaros 1992 and references therein for earlier works in which electron plasmas with @xmath46 were studied ) . in these papers , however , the damping terms in the dielectric tensor were largely neglected ( but see  2.5 of hl03 ) . including these damping terms can ( for certain parameter regimes ) modify the mode property near the vacuum resonance and give rise to the phenomenon of mode collapse .",
    "following ginzburg ( 1970 ) , we consider a cold , magnetized plasma composed of electrons and ions ( with charge , mass and number density given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively ; here @xmath49 is the charge number and @xmath50 is the mass number of the ion ) .",
    "the electrons and ions are coupled by collisions ( with the collision frequency @xmath51 ) .",
    "we generalize ginzburg s result by including the radiative dampings of electrons and ions , with the damping frequencies @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively . in the coordinate system @xmath54 with @xmath55 along @xmath49 , the plasma contribution to the dielectric tensor is given by ) and ( [ eq : eta ] ) are accurate as long as @xmath56 ; these accurate expressions are necessary in order to recover the correct scattering cross - sections . also note that when the damping terms are neglected , eqs .",
