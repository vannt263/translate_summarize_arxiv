    "the four carbon atoms in the unit cell are linked by a triple bond , a single bond , a double bond , and a single bond .",
    "the atomic distances are @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for the single  ( s ) , double  ( d ) , and triple bonds  ( t ) , respectively .",
    "the chain of atoms is not perfectly straight ; the single and double bonds alternately form angles of @xmath8 and @xmath9 degrees .",
    "very long undistorted polymer chains have been built starting from a monomer single crystal so that the chains are perfectly ordered ,  @xcite and single polymer chains diluted in their monomer matrix have even been prepared and studied .",
    "@xcite in pdas , exciton - polaritons have been generated that have been shown to be coherent over tens of micrometers , i.e. , several ten thousand monomer units .",
    "@xcite consequently , the opto - electronic properties of the pdas result from the electrons mutual interaction and their interaction with the periodic lattice potential , while the influence of disorder is negligible .",
    "pdas are insulators ; the gap for single - particle excitation is @xmath10 .",
    "band structure calculations estimate the bare band gap to be @xmath11 , i.e. , electronic exchange and correlations account for half of the single - particle gap .",
    "moreover , the optical gap for the primary exciton is @xmath12 , so that the exciton binding energy @xmath13 is about 20% of the band gap . due to the restricted geometry , the electron - electron interaction must be treated accurately for the calculation of the optical properties of the pdas .",

    "second , some pda single crystals such as tcdu  @xcite exist in two different conformations , which have exciton energies @xmath15 ( ` blue chains ' ) and @xmath16 ( ` red chains ' ) , respectively . therefore , it is not easy to disentangle the effects of the electron - electron interaction from those of the electron - lattice interaction ; the latter gives rise to resonance shifts of several tenths of an electron volt .        in order to describe the optical excitations in pdas",
    ", two approaches have been taken .",
    "the first approach starts from an ab - initio density - functional theory calculation of the bare band structure in local - density approximation ( lda ) , which is then supplemented by an approximate treatment of the residual electron - electron interaction , e.g. , the @xmath17@xmath18 approximation for the single - particle bands and the bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) for the excitons ( lda+@xmath17@xmath18+bse ) .  @xcite actual calculations for the pdas often omit the @xmath17@xmath18  step ( wannier theory ) .",
    "@xcite within this approach , a number of experimental data could be reproduced , e.g. , the exciton binding energy and its polarizability .",
    "unfortunately , the theory does not predict optically dark states below the exciton resonance .",
    "the second approach to a theoretical description of the primary excitations in polymers starts from a many - particle model hamiltonian that describes only the @xmath0-electrons and their mutual interaction .",
    "the parameters for the kinetic energy of the electrons are taken from lda calculations , and the coulomb interaction is approximated in various ways , e.g. , with the ohno parametrization  @xcite of the pariser ",
    "pople potential .",
    "@xcite with the help of the dmrg method ,  @xcite the ground state and elementary excitations for such models can be calculated for large chains with a very high accuracy . in this way",
    ", the electron - electron interaction is treated without resorting to any approximations .",
    "unfortunately , specific calculations for the pdas  @xcite have only had limited success in meeting the experimental test .      in this work",
    ", we consider structures which start with a triple bond and end with a double bond , i.e. , we consider the sequences [ ( tsds)@xmath19tsd ] of @xmath20 carbon atoms with @xmath21 triple bonds and @xmath21 double bonds .",
    "we perform a dmrg study of a many - body model hamiltonian for the @xmath0-electrons which uses barford and bursill s parametrization for the band - structure part  @xcite but employs the screened coulomb potential in one dimension .",
    "the essential difference between the screened potential and the ohno potential is that the local interaction part is larger in the screened potential . because of this , the hubbard ",
    "ohno potential leads to a good description of the low - energy singlet excitations in pdas .",
    "we do not include lattice relaxation for the single - particle and optical excitations .",
    "as has been shown by barford and co - workers ,  @xcite the relaxation energies for triplet excitons in trans - polyacetylene can be as large as @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter sets we will use below apply to the rigid - lattice situation and will change slightly when lattice relaxation is taken into account properly .    the different varieties of pda differ in their ligands , which introduce local potentials on the carbon atoms with double bonds .",
    "therefore , the excitation energies of the pdas differ by a few tenths of an electron volt . in this work ,",
    "we ignore the ligand effects and only consider a prototypical case .",
    "in this work we will restrict ourselves to the description of the @xmath0  electrons because they dominate the optical response of the poly - diacetylenes for energies @xmath23 .",
    "the motion of the electrons is described by the operator for the kinetic energy , @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are creation and annihilation operators , respectively , for electrons with spin  @xmath27 on site  @xmath28 with three - dimensional coordinate @xmath29 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath30 are the electron transfer amplitudes between neighboring sites . following ref .",
    "we set @xmath31 for the single , double , and triple bonds , respectively .",
    "we consider the half - filled band exclusively , i.e. , the number of @xmath0  electrons  @xmath32 equals the number of lattice sites  @xmath33 .",
    "the electrical current operator is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an average bond length , i.e. , we ignore geometry effects in @xmath36 due to the difference in bond lengths.@xcite    finally , we define the operator for the dipole moment , @xmath37 here @xmath38 counts the number of electrons on site  @xmath28 , and @xmath39 is the local density operator at site  @xmath28 for spin  @xmath2 .",
    "recall that we treat the pda chain as perfectly straight , so that @xmath40 is the appropriate sum over the bond distances @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for the single , double , and triplet bonds between the sites  @xmath28 and  @xmath21 .",
    "the electrons interact electrostatically via the coulomb interaction ( pariser  parr  pople model  @xcite ) @xmath44 \\ ; . \\label{eqn : ourinteraction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the pdas are insulators .",
    "therefore , the coulomb interaction is not dynamically screened at the energy scale of a few electron volts , and the screening is taken into account reasonably well by a static dielectric screening with dielectric constant @xmath45 for pdas .    for the description of electrons and holes in quantum wires and other quasi one - dimensional structures , various effective potentials have been used in the literature .",

    "below , we derive the ohno potential and justify it for intermediate to large length scales . for short distances , however , the hubbard interaction must be kept explicitly , leading to an additional parameter .",

    "the ground - state wave function of the harmonic oscillators in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 directions is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a gaussian with standard deviation @xmath67 .",

    "@xcite the distance between chains is typically @xmath69 so that the condition of weak overlap between the chains , @xmath70 , is fulfilled for @xmath71 .",
