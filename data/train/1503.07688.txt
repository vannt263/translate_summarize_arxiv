    "<S> this paper provided some relations for prime numbers that one could define several formulas for attaining prime numbers in any interval ; therefore , according to flexibility of these relations , it could be found a new branch in the field of accessing to great prime numbers followed by providing an algorithm at the end of this paper for finding the largest prime numbers . </S>"
