    "reliable and precise knowledge of the @xmath0-decay for neutron - rich nuclei is crucial to an understanding of the @xmath2-process .",
    "both the element distribution on the r - path , and the resulting final distribution of stable elements are highly sensitive to the @xmath0-decay properties of the neutron - rich nuclei involved in the process @xcite .",
    "there are about 6000 nuclei between the @xmath0 stability line and the neutron drip line .",
    "most of these nuclei can not be produced in terrestrial laboratories and one has to rely on theoretical extrapolations for beta decay properties . in neutron - rich environments electron neutrino captures could not only amplify the effect of @xmath0-decays but the subsequent @xmath3-induced neutron spallation can also contribute towards changing the r - abundance distribution pattern @xcite .",
    "correspondingly reliable predictions of @xmath0-decay for neutron - rich nuclei are considered to be very important for @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "the weak interaction rates are the important ingredients playing a crucial role in practically all stellar processes : the hydrostatic burning of massive stars , presupernova evolution of massive stars , and nucleosynthesis ( s- , p- , r- , rp- ) processes ( see , for example , the seminal paper by burbidge and collaborators @xcite ) . for densities @xmath4 ,",
    "stellar weak interaction processes are dominated by gamow - teller ( gt ) and , if applicable , by fermi transitions . for nuclei lying in the vicinity of the line of stability ,",
    "forbidden transitions contribute sizably for @xmath5 when the electron chemical potential reaches values of the order of 30 mev or more @xcite .    during presupernova stage of stellar evolution",
    ", electron capture dominates the weak interaction processes .",
    "however , after silicon depletion in the core and during the silicon shell burning , @xmath0-decay competes temporarily with electron capture and further cools the star .",
    "unlike electron capture , the @xmath0-decay at silicon burning stage increases and this bears consequences because @xmath0-decays are additional neutrino source and add to the cooling of the stellar core and a reduction in stellar entropy .",
    "this cooling of stellar core can be quite efficient as often the average neutrino energy in the involved @xmath0-decays is larger than for the competing electron capture processes .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0-decay lowers the stellar core temperature after silicon shell burning . for a discussion on the fine - tuning of lepton - to - baryon ratio of stellar matter during presupernova evolution see ref . @xcite .",
    "as the density of the stellar core increases the allowed @xmath0-decay becomes unimportant and hindered due to the fact that the increasing fermi energy of electrons blocks the available phase space for the electron to be produced in the @xmath0-decay .",

    "reliable , quantitative estimates of @xmath0-decay half - lives of neutron - rich nuclei are needed in astrophysics for the understanding of supernova explosions , and the processes of nucleosynthesis , particularly the @xmath2-process .",
    "the @xmath0-decay half - lives are also needed for the experimental exploration of the nuclear landscape at existing and future radioactive ion - beam facilities .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0-decay half - lives in agreement with experimental results has been a challenging problem for nuclear theorists .",
    "because of the scarcity of experimental data , majority of the @xmath0-decay rates of the neutron - rich nuclei have been investigated using theoretical models .",
    "several models of different level of sophistication for determining @xmath0-decay half - lives have been proposed and applied over the years .",
    "one can mention the more phenomenological treatments based on gross theory ( e.g. @xcite ) as well as microscopic treatments that employ the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) @xcite or the shell model @xcite .",
    "the later hybrid version of the rpa models developed by mller and coworkers , combines the pn - qrpa model with the statistical gross theory of the first - forbidden decay ( pnqrpa+ffgt)@xcite . there are also some models in which the ground state of the parent nucleus is described by the hartree - fock bcs method , or other density functional method ( df ) and which use the continuum qrpa ( cqrpa ) ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recently relativistic pn - qrpa ( rqrpa ) models have been applied in the treatment of neutron - rich nuclei in the @xmath6 50 , @xmath6 82 and @xmath7 28 and 50 regions @xcite . despite continuing improvements the predictive power of these conventional models is rather limited for @xmath0-decay half - lives of nuclei .",
    "the microscopic calculations of allowed weak interaction rates using the pn - qrpa model @xcite and unique first - forbidden ( u1f ) @xmath0-decay properties by homma and collaborators @xcite , under terrestrial conditions , led to a better understanding of the @xmath2-process .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a larger contribution to the total transition probability for near - stable and near - magic nuclei came from u1f transitions ( see fig .  9 and table ix of @xcite ) .",
    "according to the @xmath0-decay studies by borzov @xcite , the allowed @xmath0-decay approximation alone is not adequate to describe the isotopic dependence of the @xmath0-decay characteristics , specially for the nuclei crossing the closed @xmath8 and @xmath9 shells and forbidden transitions give a dominant contribution to the total half - life for nuclei crossing the closed shells , specially for @xmath10 50 in @xmath11ni region .",
    "recently large - scale shell - model calculation of the half - lives , including first - forbidden contributions , for @xmath2-process waiting - point nuclei was also performed @xcite .",
    "however there was a need to go to domains of high temperature and density scales where the weak interaction rates are of decisive importance in studies of the stellar evolution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moving on from terrestrial to stellar domain one notes two microscopic approaches , namely the shell model @xcite and the pn - qrpa @xcite , have so far been successfully used in the large - scale calculation of stellar weak - interaction mediated rates for @xmath2-process applications . whereas the advantage of the shell model clearly lies in it s ability to take into account the detailed structure of the @xmath0-strength functions ,",
    "the shell model is forced to use approximations like brink s hypothesis ( in electron capture direction ) and back resonances ( in @xmath0-decay direction ) when extending the calculation to high - lying parent excited states which can contribute rather significantly to the total weak rate in stellar environment .",
    "brink s hypothesis states that gt strength distribution on excited states is _ identical _ to that from ground state , shifted _ only _ by the excitation energy of the state .",
    "gt back resonances are the states reached by the strong gt transitions in the inverse process ( electron capture ) built on ground and excited states .",
    "the pn - qrpa model , on the other hand , gets rid of such approximations and allows a state - by - state evaluation of the weak rates by summing over boltzmann - weighted , microscopically determined gt strengths _ for all _ parent excited states .",
    "the recent measurement of the gt@xmath12 strength distribution of @xmath13se @xcite supports the argument that , due to nuclear correlations across the @xmath14 shell gap , the gt transitions for fp - nuclei with proton numbers @xmath15 and neutron numbers @xmath16 would not be pauli blocked .",
    "nevertheless for neutron - rich nuclei u1f transitions are favored due to the amplification of available phase space .",
    "further in the large - scale shell - model first - forbidden calculation of zhi and collaborators @xcite the authors note that for @xmath8 = 50 nuclei with @xmath17 28 , contributions to the first forbidden transitions are nearly exclusively due to rank 2 operators . in this paper",
    "we attempt to calculate the allowed as well as the unique first - forbidden ( u1f ) @xmath0-decay rates for neutron - rich nickel isotopes ( @xmath1ni ) using the pn - qrpa model .",
    "further the calculations are extended from terrestrial to stellar domain for the first time using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "motivation of the current work was primarily based on the comments given by homma and collaborators that the u1f transition has large enough contribution to the total transition probability and inclusion of u1f transition greatly improves the calculated half - lives using the pn - qrpa model @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to also study the effects of non - unique forbidden transitions which are expected , for some nuclei , to have still larger contribution to the calculated half - lives ( as also mentioned in @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to include this desired modification in our nuclear code as a future project .",
    "the theory of allowed and first - forbidden @xmath0-decay transitions ( along with its leptonic phase - space content and nuclear matrix elements ) is well - established @xcite .",
    "whereas the allowed @xmath0-decay ( having the same parity before and after the decay ) is relatively simple to calculate , the first - forbidden decay shows a far wider spectrum both in lepton kinematics and in nuclear matrix elements @xcite .    the pn - qrpa formalism for calculations of the total @xmath0-decay half - lives and u1f @xmath0-decay rates for neutron - rich nickel isotopes",
    "are discussed in section 2 .",
    "results and comparisons with experimental and other theoretical calculation are shown in section 3 .",
    "section 4 outlines the importance of the results in connection with the simulation of the advanced stages of stellar evolution and heavy element nucleosynthesis and concludes our discussion on consequences of u1f @xmath0-decays in stellar matter .",
    "in the pn - qrpa formalism @xcite , proton - neutron residual interactions occur in two different forms , namely as particle - hole ( @xmath18 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath19 ) interactions .",
    "the particle - hole and particle - particle interactions can be given a separable form because @xmath0@xmath20 transitions are dominated by the particle - hole interaction .",
    "these @xmath18 and @xmath19 forces are repulsive and attractive , respectively , when the strength parameters @xmath21 for @xmath18 gt force and @xmath22 for @xmath19 gt force take positive values .",
    "the advantage of using these separable gt forces is that the qrpa matrix equation reduces to an algebraic equation of fourth order , which is much easier to solve as compare to full diagonalization of the non - hermitian matrix of large dimensionality @xcite .",
    "essentially we first construct a quasiparticle basis ( defined by a bogoliubov transformation ) with a pairing interaction , and then solve the rpa equation with a schematic separable gt residual interaction .",
    "the single particle energies were calculated using a deformed nilsson oscillator potential with a quadratic deformation .",
    "the pairing correlation was taken into account in the bcs approximation using constant pairing forces .",
    "the bcs calculation was performed in the deformed nilsson basis for neutrons and protons separately . the formalism for calculation of allowed",

    "we describe briefly the necessary formalism to calculate the u1f @xmath0-decay rates .    allowed fermi and",
    "gt transitions have a maximum spin change of one unit and no change in parity of the wavefunction .",
    "in contrast , the most frequent occurrence of a forbidden decay is when the initial and final states have opposite parities , and thus the selection rule for allowed decay is violated .",
    "the spins of the initial and final states can be different at most by @xmath23j= 0 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 for the first - forbidden transitions ( those transitions for which @xmath25 are termed as unique first - forbidden ) .",
    "the isospin selection rule remains the same as for allowed decays . for the calculation of the u1f @xmath0-decay rates ,",
    "nuclear matrix elements of the separable forces which appear in rpa equation are given by    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28_{2\\mu}|j_{n}m_{n}>\\ ] ] is a single - particle u1f transition amplitude ( the symbols have their normal meaning ) .",
    "note that @xmath29 takes the values @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( for allowed decay rates @xmath29 only takes the values @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , and the proton and neutron states have opposite parities @xcite .",
    "for the sake of consistency we chose to keep the same values of interaction constants ( @xmath21 = 0.35 mev and @xmath22 = 0.001 mev for allowed and @xmath21 = 0.35 mev @xmath34 and @xmath22 = 0.001 mev @xmath34 for u1f transitions ) .",

    "the incorporation of u1f transitions decreased the calculated half - lives from about 36@xmath98 for the case of @xmath91ni to about 47@xmath98 for the case of @xmath11ni .",
    "[ fig1 ] proves that the inclusion of the u1f contribution makes the half - life predictions more reliable for neutron - rich nickel isotopes .",
    "recently a large - scale shell - model calculation of half - lives including first - forbidden transitions ( including rank 0 , 1 and 2 operators ) was performed for @xmath2-process waiting - point nuclei @xcite . in their work",

    "was used in the shell model calculation and different quenching factors ranging from 0.38 to 1.266 was used for the various nuclear matrix elements .",
    "no explicit quenching factor was used in current calculation in contrast to shell model calculation .",
    "last but not the least , due to model space limitation in shell model calculation , authors in ref .",
    "@xcite were not able to recover the full gt and first - forbidden strengths built on the ground and isomeric states .",

    "this is primarily because of the reduction in phase space of allowed @xmath0-decay rates as @xmath8 increases .",
    "[ fig8 ] for @xmath11ni ( double - magic nucleus ) is very much similar to the even - even case of @xmath13ni ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the half - life of @xmath11ni ( and consequently it s @xmath0-decay rate ) is believed to set the processing timescale for the synthesis of elements beyond a @xmath106 80 .",
    "the neutron separation energy shows discontinuity at @xmath8 = 50 and consequently the @xmath2-process matter flow slows down .",
    "the @xmath0-decay of @xmath11ni then takes charge and accordingly @xmath11ni is considered to be a crucial waiting point nuclei for @xmath2-process .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows that for stellar density range 10@xmath78- 10@xmath80 g/@xmath79 , the total @xmath0-decay rates of @xmath11ni increase from 3.5 @xmath103 at t@xmath82 = 0.01 to around 225 @xmath103 at t@xmath82 = 30 . as the stellar core stiffens to a density of around 10@xmath81 g/@xmath79",
    ", the @xmath0-decay rates decrease by tens of orders of magnitude at low stellar temperatures to around 67 @xmath103 at t@xmath82 = 30 .",
    "further our calculation shows significant u1f contribution to total @xmath0-decay rates of @xmath11ni at low stellar temperatures t@xmath107 1 . at high temperatures of t@xmath82 = 30 ,",
    "the allowed rates are a factor 7 ( for low and intermediate densities ) to factor 13 bigger ( for high densities ) than the u1f @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "it is to be noted that increasing the stellar temperature weakly affects the u1f @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "the reason is that the first - forbidden transitions are of relatively high energies and basically of the particle - hole nature .",
    "therefore a smearing of single - particle strengths due to pairing correlations and temperature influence them considerably less . on the other hand the allowed gt rates increase at a faster pace with increasing temperature and",
    "hence explains this feature in all figures .    in the @xmath0-decay of a particular isotope , an emitted electron can receive any kinetic energy from zero up to the maximum kinetic energy available for the decay . in stellar environments",
    ", the electron density can be sufficiently high so that the low - energy states of the electron gas are essentially filled .",
    "in such an environment , there are fewer states available into which a low - energy electron can be emitted , and therefore @xmath0-decay is strongly inhibited if maximum kinetic energy available for the decay is small .",
    "for u1f decays , when maximum kinetic energy available for the decay is small , the inhibition of unique first - forbidden decays is not as large as the inhibition of allowed , for the same temperature , density , and @xmath0-decay energy @xcite .",
    "this feature is also exhibited in all figures shown .",
    "in this work the total stellar @xmath0@xmath20-decay half - lives and u1f @xmath0-decay rates for a number of neutron - rich nuclei have been calculated , for the first time , using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "the temperature and density profiles were relevant to advanced nuclear burning stages of the presupernova and supernova star .",
    "the results for total @xmath0-decay half - lives are in better agreement with the experimental results @xcite as compared to the pn - qrpa calculated half - lives including only allowed gt transitions . at the same time",
    "the calculations suggest that incorporation of rank 0 and rank 1 operators in calculation of first - forbidden transitions can further improve the results and we plan to work on this in near future .",
    "the microscopic calculation of u1f @xmath0-decay rates , presented in this work , could lead to a better understanding of the nuclear composition and @xmath67 in the core prior to collapse and collapse phase .",
    "the stellar @xmath0-decay rates of waiting point nucleus , @xmath11ni , presented in this work can prove useful for @xmath2-process simulation which is a leading candidate for synthesizing heavy elements in astrophysical sites .",
    "what possible implications can the enhanced u1f @xmath0-decay rates have for astrophysical scenarios ? during the collapse phase allowed @xmath0-decays become unimportant due to the increased electron chemical potential which drastically reduces the phase space for the beta electrons .",
    "it is well known that a smaller lepton fraction disfavors the outward propagation of the post - bounce shock waves , as more overlying iron core has to be photo - dissociated .",
    "it is noted that the u1f @xmath0-decay rates yield higher y@xmath108 in comparison to ( only ) allowed @xmath0-decay rates prior to collapse .",
    "this might assist the march of post - bounce shock for a successful supernova explosion to occur .",
    "further these stronger @xmath0-decay rates can also assist in a more vigorous urca process and may lead to cooler presupernova cores consisting of lesser neutron - rich matter than in presently assumed simulations .",
    "the reduced @xmath0-decay half - lives also bear consequences for site - independent @xmath2-process calculations and might result in speeding - up of the @xmath2-matter flow relative to calculations based on half - lives calculated from only allowed gt transitions . however studies on other neutron - rich isotopic chains including non - unique forbidden contributions , as well as their relative abundance , are further required to draw more concrete conclusions and would be taken as a future assignment .",
    "significant progress is expected , in part , to also come from next - generation radioactive ion - beam facilities ( e.g. fair ( germany ) , frib ( usa ) and frib ( japan ) ) when we would have access to measured strength distribution of many more neutron - rich nuclei .",
