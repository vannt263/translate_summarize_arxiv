    "halo nuclei are weakly bound and spatially extended systems , and they are expected to appear along the driplines , where nucleon single particle @xmath8 or @xmath9-states occur with sufficiently small separation energy @xcite .",
    "few - body techniques have proved to be very successful to describe them @xcite .",
    "the core degrees of freedom decouple from the ones of the halo nucleons , and a cluster description of the system becomes then appropriate @xcite .    among the halo structures , the three - body borromean bound systems ( where the two - body subsystems are all unbound ) are specially challenging @xcite . for nuclei",
    "the most likely three - body halo candidates are borromean systems with small binding energy .",
    "the reason is that three particles with attractive short - range interactions are more bound than only two of them .",
    "this is not necessarily true when also a sufficiently strong repulsive coulomb interaction or pauli repulsion is present .",
    "furthermore the core should contain an even number of the nucleons surrounding it , because otherwise one valence nucleon would be pulled into the core leaving at most one with the larger spatial extension of a halo .    along the neutron",
    "dripline the most studied three - body borromean halos are @xmath10he and @xmath11li .",
    "heavier neutron dripline systems present very interesting challenges , but the interaction ingredients are often not well established or the simple three - body structures are not directly applicable .",
    "examples could be @xmath12be , @xmath13b , @xmath14c , @xmath15f and @xmath16ne . since the coulomb interaction works against halo formation , on the proton dripline the appearance of halos is less likely , and the candidates necessarily require a relatively light core .",
    "in fact , heavier halos than ne are not expected @xcite .",
    "still the degrees of freedom describing the core and the surrounding protons may decouple to some extent and a few - body treatment might be justified .",
    "the interest in genuine two - proton decays have increased recently especially due to the improved experimental techniques @xcite .",
    "this fact has motivated different investigations on light proton rich nuclei .",
    "an especially interesting case is the lightest borromean dripline nucleus @xmath0ne ( @xmath1o+p+p ) , whose excited resonance states are promising candidates to decay through direct two - proton emission @xcite . however , the structure of @xmath0ne is very controversial .",
    "the available publications predict very different content of the @xmath8 and @xmath17-waves @xcite .",
    "inconsistencies prevail even in a very recent and detailed three - body calculation of the structure of @xmath0ne @xcite .",
    "nevertheless these models are used to predict new features of the delicate thomas - ehrman shifts between states in @xmath0ne and @xmath0n @xcite .",
    "these inconsistencies may be related to the fact that @xmath1o has a non - vanishing spin which is difficult to handle consistently and therefore sometimes simply ignored .",
    "unfortunately the finite core spin is a crucial ingredient in the structure of the excited resonance states , at least if they have to be related to the measured resonances of @xmath3f nucleus .",
    "we therefore decided to investigate @xmath0ne with an established method which is well tested on the neutron dripline @xcite .",
    "this method employs hyperspheric adiabatic expansion which is especially suited to describe large and weakly bound systems like halo nuclei @xcite .",
    "furthermore , simultaneous use of the complex scaling transformation converts the method into an efficient tool to compute three - body resonances @xcite .",
    "the inconsistencies might perhaps be related to simplified treatments of @xmath0ne as a three - body system of a core and two protons . however , all the lowest excited states in the @xmath1o - core occur with positive parities between 5.2  mev and 9  mev with one exception of 3/2@xmath18 at about 6.2  mev . the ground , first and second excited states of @xmath0ne occur with negative parities at -0.94  mev , 0.34  mev and 0.82  mev from the two - proton threshold .",
    "these energies are small compared to even the lowest - lying core - excited states , which furthermore would have to be combined with proton valence states of negative parity only present in the next shell .",
    "thus two suppressing effects must occur simultaneously to contribute to these states in @xmath0ne .",
    "in fact these arguments also apply to the third and fourth excited state in @xmath0ne although now the energies are only a factor of two smaller than the core - excited states .",
    "the 3/2@xmath18 state at 6.2  mev is then the most likely contributor , but its energy is still relatively high . we can not exclude small contributions form this core excitation but it seems unlikely that the ground state is affected , since then the two protons should pay a prize of combining into either one @xmath17-wave or two @xmath9-waves .",
    "again this is double suppression and rather unlikely .",
    "still contributions to the excited states of @xmath0ne are not as strongly excluded . in any case",
    "such a core - excitation can not be the origin of the inconsistencies .",
    "insignificant contributions from core - excitations is equivalent to the assumption of a structureless core .",
    "the probability distributions of core and valence particles may still be overlapping provided the corresponding degrees of freedom are dynamically decoupled .",
    "the restriction to the smaller hilbert space in a few - body treatment necessitates a matching renormalization of the interaction achieved by phenomenological constraints on the effective potential .",
    "the related difficulty of antisymmetry between core and valence nucleons is approximately accounted for by use of phase equivalent potentials @xcite .    in the present work we investigate in detail the characteristics of the low - lying states in @xmath0ne in a three - body model .",
    "we arrive at a consistent picture describing simultaneously the two - body properties of the internal subsystems and the global three - body properties .",
    "the contributions to the @xmath0ne states from the different partial waves are carefully analyzed .",
    "we do not encounter any sign of a break between properties of ground and excited states as a signal of substantial contribution of core - excitation from the possible 3/2@xmath18 state .",
    "the convergence of the model and possible uncertainties from the details of the two - body interactions are also investigated . in this attempt to arrive at a consistent picture",
    "we shall confront our calculations with results from previous work and if possible determine the origin of discrepancies .",
    "we already in @xcite discussed a specific application to the thomas - ehrman shifts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe very briefly the method used to compute three - body bound state wave functions and three - body resonances as well as the proton - proton and proton-@xmath1o interactions . with the three - body model and the input",
    "properly defined we then in section 3 discuss the structure of the low - lying states of @xmath0ne .",
    "the accuracy of the results and the relation to previous works are discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "we close the paper with a summary and conclusions .",
    "an accurate description of a three - body system requires a suitable method to solve the faddeev ( or schrdinger ) equations and the interactions between the constituent particles .",
    "we first very briefly sketch the method and then we give a few details about the most important of the two - body interactions      we use the hyperspheric adiabatic expansion method as described in details for instance in @xcite .",
    "the three - body wave function is a sum of three faddeev components @xmath19 ( @xmath20=1,2,3 ) , each of them expressed in one of the three possible sets of jacobi coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "each component is then expanded in terms of a complete set of angular functions @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the hyperspheric coordinates . writing the faddeev equations in terms of these coordinates , and inserting the expansions ( [ eq1b ] ) , the faddeev equations can be separated into angular and radial parts : @xmath28 f_n(\\rho ) \\nonumber & & \\\\",
    "+ \\sum_{n ' } \\left ( -2 p_{n n ' } \\frac{d}{d\\rho } - q_{n n ' } \\right)f_{n'}(\\rho ) = 0 & & \\;\\ ; \\;\\ ;   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the two - body interaction between particles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is an angular operator @xcite and @xmath33 is the normalization mass . in eq.([eq3 ] ) @xmath34 is the three - body energy , @xmath35 is a three - body potential used for fine - tuning and the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given for instance in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the set of angular functions used in the expansion ( [ eq1b ] ) are precisely the eigenfunctions of the angular part of the faddeev equations .",
    "their corresponding eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath38 , and enter in the radial equations ( [ eq3 ] ) as an essential ingredient in the diagonal part of the effective radial potentials : @xmath39    the complex scaling method @xcite amounts to rotation of the hyperradius ( @xmath40 ) , while the hyperangles remain unchanged @xcite .",
    "as soon as the rotation angle @xmath41 is larger than the argument of any given resonance , then this resonance together with the bound states is obtained as an exponentially decreasing solution to the coupled set of radial equations ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the problem of matching with the non trivial coulomb asymptotics is thus avoided , since the resonance corresponds to a solution with  bound state \" asymptotics .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the complex scaling method allows reliable calculations of resonance energies , also for three - body systems with the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the two - body potentials must describe the properties of the two - body subsystems .",
    "however , unreflected reproduction of the low - lying spectra of the two - body systems is not sufficient .",
    "the subsequent use in the context of a specific hilbert space could be crucial .",
    "this becomes particularly evident when a number of degrees of freedom are frozen in the three - body computation while simultaneously also necessary to conserve symmetries of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "an appropriate example is the spin - dependence of the assumed form of the effective two - body potentials .",
    "a bad choice can lead to catastrophic results for the three - body system @xcite .",
    "for the proton - proton interaction we use the parametrization given in @xcite .",
    "other choices have been tried as well but the three - body results do not change significantly .    for the proton-@xmath1o interaction spin - dependent operators are indispensable to reproduce the properties of the low - lying @xmath3f resonances .",
    "we parametrize by use of operators that conserve the proton total angular momentum @xmath42=@xmath43+@xmath44 and the total two - body angular momentum @xmath45=@xmath42+@xmath46 , where @xmath43 is the relative orbital angular momentum , and @xmath46 and @xmath44 are the core ( @xmath1o ) and proton spins , respectively .",
    "these operators permit a clear energy separation of the usual mean - field spin - orbit partners @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is then possible to use a proton - core interaction such that the low - lying states have well defined @xmath49 quantum numbers , like the @xmath50 states in @xmath3f .",
    "this is especially important when one of these states is forbidden by the pauli principle , like for instance the @xmath51 waves in @xmath52li @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we introduced an @xmath53-dependent proton - core interaction of the form : @xmath54 where the shapes of the central ( @xmath55 ) , spin - spin ( @xmath56 ) and spin - orbit ( @xmath57 ) radial potentials are chosen to be woods - saxon functions , @xmath58 , with the same diffuseness @xmath59 in all terms .",
    "the proton number of the core is @xmath60 .",
    "the error function @xmath61 describes the proton - core coulomb interaction of a gaussian core - charge distribution .",
    "the range parameter @xmath62=2.16 fm reproduces the experimental rms charge radius in @xmath1o of 2.65 fm .    in @xcite the parameters of the woods - saxon radial potentials",
    "were adjusted to reproduce the experimental energies of the four lowest states in @xmath3f , and simultaneously , after switching off the coulomb interaction , the energies of the corresponding states in the mirror nucleus @xmath3n .",
    "the resulting parameters are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".[tab1 ] radius ( @xmath63 ) and strengths of the central ( @xmath64 ) , spin - spin ( @xmath65 ) , and spin - orbit ( @xmath66 ) potentials in eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , that correspond to the woods - saxon ( ws ) and gaussian ( g ) proton - core interactions , respectively . in ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "the diffuseness @xmath59 is 0.65 fm in all the cases . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a detailed calculation of @xmath0ne and @xmath0n has been reported recently in @xcite .",
    "a three - body model is employed and woods - saxon potentials between the three pairs of particles are used .",
    "the weight of the different partial waves for the ground state contains around 40% and 48% @xmath8-wave in the @xmath0n and @xmath0ne wave functions , respectively .",
    "these values decrease for the first and second excited states , where the @xmath5-wave content varies from case to case between 34.5% and 38.1% . in table",
    "[ tab11 ] we compare our results to the ones given in @xcite . for completeness we also include our results for the @xmath0n case .",
    "the agreement is rather good in all the cases .",
    "however , apparently in @xcite interferences between @xmath8 and @xmath17 waves are not considered , while we have found that for the excited states they are crucial . furthermore , it is not easy to understand how two protons in the @xmath67-waves can give rise to the excited @xmath68 state , provided the @xmath1o core still has spin of 1/2 .",
    "it is also important to remember that by @xmath53-wave content we refer to the weight of the components in tables [ tab3]@xmath69[tab7 ] containing that value of @xmath53 . in this way ,",
    "our @xmath70=@xmath71=0 components are not fully equivalent to the @xmath5-content in the shell model sense .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0ne is previously investigated only in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the nucleon - nucleon interaction is adjusted to reproduce the @xmath0ne ground state binding energy , but the same interaction is not able to describe the @xmath3n and @xmath3f spectra .",
    "even the level order is wrong and the 3@xmath18 level comes out as the ground state in both cases .",
    "for the three - body systems the ground state angular momentum is correct in @xcite , but the 3/2@xmath18 and 5/2@xmath18 levels are reversed compared to the experimental data .",
    "the lack of consistency between the two - body interaction needed to reproduce the three - body ground state and the one reproducing the two - body spectra of the two - body subsystems is certainly a weak point in this calculation .",
    "the same deficiency is present in @xcite , where the three - body structure in @xmath0ne obtained with the two - body interactions that reproduce the @xmath3f spectrum also reverse the positions of the @xmath72 and @xmath68-states .",
    "the @xmath68-level is even bound by @xmath73 mev , while the @xmath72-state has an energy above threshold of 0.89 mev .",
    "a three - body force adjusted for each of the states is needed to restore the level order and the positions as found in experiments .",
    "it is then clear that the three - body force is forced to play a too important role , since the @xmath68 energy is moving up from @xmath73 mev to the experimental 0.82 mev and simultaneously the @xmath72 is moved down in energy .    in the present work",
    "these problems are not encountered . when only the two - body forces describing the proton - proton and @xmath3f properties are used , the energies of the @xmath0ne states are the ones in the third column of table  [ tab8 ] .",
    "they follow the experimental ordering , and use of a small effective three - body force is enough to fit the experimental energies .    the fact that in @xcite the same inversion as in @xcite appears can be related to the inappropriate spin dependent operators used in the two - body nucleon - core interaction .",
    "contrary to the present work the interaction in @xcite is mixing the @xmath74 and the @xmath50-states used as an essential part of the valence space for the outer nucleons .",
    "the low - lying resonances in @xmath3n and @xmath3f do not have the desirable pure @xmath50-character @xcite .",
    "finally the partial two - proton decay widths of the three - body resonances are estimated in the present work , see table [ tab10 ] . in @xcite",
    "the widths of the @xmath72 and @xmath68-states are found to be @xmath75 mev and @xmath76 mev , respectively smaller by seven and one order of magnitude compared to our results .",
    "this computed @xmath72 value is in apparent agreement with the experimental limit .",
    "however , their computed width of the @xmath68 resonance is already at least one order of magnitude too small .",
    "the eight orders of magnitude difference between these two computed values seem to be in clear disagreement with measurements which indicates that the lowest and highest of these resonances have widths slightly below and above the electromagnetic decay widths .",
    "the origin of these discrepancies can not be decided without full repetition of all computations .",
    "two effects are perhaps important in this connection .",
    "the first is that the basis size has to be rather large to provide a sufficiently accurate description all the way up to the relatively large distances where important contributions to the widths are determined .",
    "too small a basis would usually lead to too high potential energies and therefore too large barriers and too small widths .",
    "the maximum hypermoment must be very large when only hyperharmonics in one jacobi set are used .",
    "the second effect is that the hypersherical adiabatic expansion in principle includes all decay channels , i.e. also sequential decay which often is the dominating mode . for the @xmath72-state",
    "this is apparently not allowed due to energy conservation . however , a kind of virtual decay , where the tail of the two - body resonance is exploited , would enhance the decay probability .",
    "this effect is included in our formulation since the two - body resonance configuration influences the lower adiabatic potentials to fairly large hyperradii .",
    "this effect is difficult to catch with the direct hyperharmonic expansion method .",
    "the structure of the lightest borromean nucleus @xmath0ne is investigated in details in a three - body model where two protons surround the @xmath1o core .",
    "we use the hyperspheric adiabatic expansion method with two - body interactions adjusted to reproduce the properties of the two - body subsystems .",
    "the spin - dependent form of the proton - core interaction must be consistent with the mean - field approximation .",
    "otherwise the assumed decoupling of core and valence motion is violated due to the pauli principle and the angular momentum conservation .",
    "we use two different radial shapes for the proton - core potential both consistent with the measured size of @xmath1o .",
    "the coulomb potential is derived from a gaussian charge distribution with the measured root mean square radius .    the three - body ground state and four measured excited states of @xmath0ne are computed .",
    "the structure for the ground state is found to be about 45% of @xmath5 ( @xmath70=@xmath71=0 ) and 50% of @xmath6 ( @xmath70=@xmath71=2 ) proton - core components . for the two lowest excited states the @xmath7 relative proton - core states are dominating while only roughly 18% is of @xmath6-character . for the two highest resonances , @xmath6-components",
    "dominate completely in the second and third jacobi sets , while contributions from higher partial waves ( @xmath77 and @xmath78-components ) can be important in the first jacobi set .",
    "properties of these states are not computed in previous works .",
    "the spatial distribution is slightly more extended than for ordinary nuclei and with a clear tendency to show two components , i.e. one where the protons and the core are distributed in a triangle and one where the protons try to be on opposite sides of the core .",
    "the distribution is not in the classically forbidden region and the scaling relations specific for quantum halos are not obeyed .",
    "the criteria for quantum halos are not fulfilled .",
    "still the three - body model seems to give a rather good description of the structure of these five lowest - lying states .",
    "the two - proton decay widths are computed by use of the wkb approximation applied on the adiabatic potentials .",
    "the computed results are within the experimentally determined limits .",
    "the width estimates employ a recently established but non - trivial formulation which relies on the efficiency of both the hyperspheric adiabatic method and the separation at small and intermediate distances of the intrinsic and the necessary asymptotic three - body degrees of freedom .",
    "accuracy of these computations can be divided into three parts , i.e. ( i ) model assumptions related to its applicability , ( ii ) input determination , uniqueness and reliability , ( iii ) numerical accuracy including convergence of expansions .",
    "first the consistency of the results supports the credibility of the model .",
    "second we carefully evaluated the accuracy both by testing for convergence and by using different two - body interactions .    in conclusion",
    ", the three - body model describes efficiently the cluster structure of @xmath0ne .",
    "the hyperspheric adiabatic expansion in the same framework provides consistently also the simple semiclassical estimates of resonance decays into three - body final states .",
    "we want to thank hans fynbo for useful suggestions and discussions ."
