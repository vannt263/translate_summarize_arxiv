    "large - scale diffuse soft x - ray emission ( galactic coronae ) has been detected around various types of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "they include elliptical galaxies containing active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or not ( e.g. , @xcite ) , normal disk galaxies with little star formation ( sf ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) , galaxies with active sf spread widely over their disk ( e.g. , @xcite ) , nuclear starburst galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and interacting or merging galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , etc .",
    "the presence of such galactic coronae is a manifestation of the energetic interplay between galaxies and their surroundings , although the exact origin of the x - ray emission remains very uncertain .    in x - ray observations of _ active sf _ galaxies ,",
    "the coronal luminosity is observed to be tightly ( nearly linearly ) correlated with the sf rate ( sfr ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the coronal gas often shows metallicity patterns consistent with being enriched by massive stellar objects [ e.g. , massive stellar winds and core collapsed ( cc ) sne ] ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these strongly suggest that the coronal gas in star forming galaxies is mainly generated by sf feedback .",
    "in addition , deep observations of some nuclear starburst galaxies have revealed a high - temperature ( @xmath1 ) thermal component , which is usually not detected because of its low density and hence low emissivity , compared to the dominant soft x - ray - emitting gas of typical temperature of a few @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this high - temperature component is thought to be produced by the sn - driven superwinds themselves , which carry the bulk of the sn feedback energy and interact with the cool interstellar medium ( ism ) , producing much of the soft x - ray emission at the interfaces @xcite , although this view is still far from being widely accepted ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .    in contrast , the diffuse soft x - ray luminosity ( @xmath3 ) of sf - quiescent _ elliptical _ galaxies is shown to be closely correlated with the stellar mass ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , the slope of the @xmath5 relation is shown to be far larger than unity , especially for massive galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , strongly suggesting that gravity plays an important role in heating and/or confining the coronal gas .",
    "metallicity measurements further indicate that the hot gas in elliptical galaxies ( maybe except for those located in cluster environments ) is primarily enriched by old stars ( via type  ia sne and stellar mass loss , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the modeling of this stellar feedback shows that galactic scale outflow are most likely responsible for removing a large fraction of the sn energy , and chemically - enriched mass from central regions of low- and intermediate - mass elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . but both the dynamics and ultimate fate of the outflows are sensitive to the feedback history , as well as to the gravitational confinement of the galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the coronal gas remains very uncertain for relatively _ quiescent disk _ galaxies ( such as the milky way and m31 ) .",
    "indeed , the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario definitively predicts the presence of coronae around galaxies with individual halo masses greater than a few @xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such coronae are formed primarily from the ( virial ) shock - heating and subsequent gravitational compression of gas accreted from the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "but non - gravitational heating is also expected to be important .",
    "observationally , non - nuclear - starburst galaxies , for example , seem to follow the same @xmath7 relation as nuclear starburst ones @xcite . even in passively evolving bulge - dominated disk galaxies ( e.g. , s0 galaxies ) which are often quiescent",
    ", non - gravitational feedback can still be significant , primarily in forms of ia sne and mass - loss of evolved low - mass stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus of great interest to check if the coronae around quiescent disk galaxies represent the interplay between gravitational and non - gravitational effects , and what roles different heating mechanisms play in producing galactic coronae in and around various types of galaxies .",
    "we herein present a comprehensive _ chandra _ data analysis for a sample of 53 nearby highly - inclined _ disk _ galaxies , together with multi - wavelength measurements of other galaxy properties , such as the sfr , stellar mass , and dynamical mass .",
    "our sample includes all kinds of disk galaxies and covers a large range of galaxy properties . in comparison , similar existing studies of nearby highly - inclined disk galaxies , based on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , all have sample sizes less than about 10 galaxies @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies are relatively well studied ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the results will be compared with those from the present study in the companion paper ( @xcite , hereafter paper  ii ) .",
    "the large sample size of the disk galaxies in the present study will enable us to examine the similarities and differences between various types of galaxies . by conducting a multi - variable statistical analysis",
    ", we will also examine how the coronal properties are affected by other processes , such as the environmental effects ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the cool - hot gas interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this analysis of archival _ chandra _ data forms part of a long - term multi - wavelength investigation of galactic halos and their interplay with galactic disks .",
    "in particular , an extensive radio survey of 35 nearby highly - inclined disk galaxies , which represents a volume - limited sample , is being carried out with the _ evla _ ( the _ chang - es _ project ; @xcite ) .",
    "16 of these galaxies are included in the present _ chandra _ analysis , which represents the first step to provide the x - ray data coverage of the _ chang - es _ galaxies .",
    "this archival study represents a necessary preparation for proposing new x - ray observations for deep exposures or for additional galaxies . with the superb spatial resolution ,",
    "_ chandra _ observations are ideal for detecting and subtracting point - like sources , mapping out galactic coronae , particularly in regions close to the galactic disks .",
    "an analysis program , using existing and new _ xmm - newton _ observations , is also planned , which can provide complementary capabilities ( e.g. , greater counting statistics and field coverage ) and are better suited for spectral analysis of large - scale x - ray emission .",
    "the present paper utilizes mainly the _ chandra _ data for the detection and excision of x - ray point sources and the characterization of the galactic coronae in and around the sample galaxies .",
    "we report the x - ray measurements of the coronae in this paper . in  [ paperisec : sampleselection ]",
    "we introduce the sample selection criteria and the definitions of subsamples .",
    "the data reduction and analysis are detailed in ",
    "[ paperisec : datereduction ] , providing uniform measurements of the diffuse soft x - ray properties for all the sample galaxies .",
    "notes on individual galaxies of distinct properties are given in ",
    "[ paperisec : individual ] .",
    "we discuss uncertainties related to the data analysis in ",
    "[ paperisec : discussion ] .",
    "the main results are summarized in  [ paperisec : summary ] .",
    "paper ii presents ( 1 ) a detailed correlation analysis between the x - ray properties ( e.g. , luminosity , temperature , and abundance ratio ) and multi - wavelength galaxy properties ( e.g. , sf properties , galaxy mass , and morphology ) for different types of galaxies ; ( 2 ) a comparison of our measurements ( e.g. , the coronal luminosity and/or temperature ) with those from cosmological simulations or _ chandra",
    "_ observations of elliptical galaxies ; ( 3 ) an estimate of the x - ray radiation efficiency of the galactic feedback ; and ( 4 ) an investigation of the origin of the coronal emission .",
    "we are aiming at understanding the relative importance of various physical processes in generating galactic coronae in and around different types of disk galaxies .",
    "we thus need a large sample of galaxies with all types of sf properties , masses , morphologies , and formation environments . limited by the availability of existing _",
    "observations , our sample selection for the present study is thus related to , but not limited by , the _ chang - es _",
    "sample @xcite , with the following criteria :    \\(1 ) _ morphological classification . _",
    "the present study includes both spiral and lenticular galaxies with optical morphological type codes of @xmath8 ( table  [ table : sampleselectionpara ] ) .",
    "this means that some interacting galaxies may be included .",
    "these galaxies are sometimes observed to have quite different x - ray properties from the isolated ones ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and may provide us with a laboratory to study how galaxy interaction could regulate the coronal properties .",
    "\\(2 ) _ inclination angle . _ with the inclination angle restricted to @xmath0 , the sample includes not only nearly perfect edge - on galaxies , but also some moderately inclined ones . for the latter ones ,",
    "additional inclination corrections may be needed to uniformly compare them with other galaxies in the sample .",
    "but in general , the selection of only highly inclined disk galaxies minimizes the confusion of the soft x - ray emission from discrete sources in galactic disks ( young stars , supernova remnants , etc . ) .",
    "the present study thus preferentially samples the diffuse soft x - ray emission from regions outside galactic disks with dense cool gas .",
    "\\(3 ) _ distance .",
    "_ all the selected galaxies have distances @xmath9 so that the bulk of luminous point sources can be individually detected and that the disk / halo emission can be reasonably separated .",
    "the distances of the galaxies are obtained based on various redshift independent methods , as listed in table  [ table : distance ] .",
    "\\(4 ) _ extinction .",
    "_ all the galaxies are selected to have the foreground column density @xmath10 , minimizing the galactic extinction in soft x - ray .",
    "\\(5 ) _ size .",
    "_ all the galaxies have optical diameters @xmath11 so that a single _ chandra _ observation could typically cover the bulk of the coronal emission .",
    "@xmath12 is also limited to @xmath13 so that the disk and halo can be well separated .",
    "\\(6 ) _ chandra data . _",
    "each of the selected galaxies has a total non - grating _",
    "chandra_/acis exposure @xmath14 .",
    "we only include observations with individual exposures @xmath15 ( table  [ table : chandradata ] ) .",
    "galaxies with only multiple snapshot observations , even with a total exposure @xmath15 , are not included , except for ngc  660 ( @xmath16 ) and ngc  4666 ( @xmath17 ) , which are known to have high sfrs and are expected to have strong diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "\\(7 ) _ agn contamination .",
    "_ we do _ not _ select our sample against galaxies containing agn .",
    "nevertheless , we have excluded one galaxy ( ngc  2992 ) from our original sample , because the scattered x - ray light from its agn ( wings of point - spread function , as well as a severe ccd readout steak ) is too bright to allow for an effective study of the galactic corona ( the thermal component is @xmath18 of the total diffuse x - ray emission in the near - nuclear region of @xmath19 ; @xcite ) .",

    "are the products of massive stars and are often adopted as direct sf indicators .",
    "however , such relatively short wavelength radiation is often highly attenuated by dust in a highly inclined galactic disk . here",
    ", we estimate the sfr of an individual galaxy using its total ir luminosity ( table  [ table : basicparaii ] ) , which is mainly from the dust - reprocessed young stellar emission and is little affected by the extinction .",
    "we further check if such a simple estimation of the sfr is consistent with other extinction - free sf tracers , such as the radio continuum emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) and the molecular gas mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    "we use the mass of the molecular gas ( instead of that of the total cold gas including atomic gas , as sometimes considered in similar analysis , e.g. , @xcite ) , because it shows a better correlation with the sf activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the relations between different sf tracers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sftracer ] , and can be expressed with the following equations : @xmath558 @xmath559 despite the tight correlations , all these sf tracers have their own uncertainties .",
    "for example , ir emission can be produced by circum - stellar dust in early - type galaxies @xcite ; radio continuum emission can be produced by agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; sf inactive galaxies may still host significant amount of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even if the current sfr is accurately estimated , the different sf history of different types of galaxies also mean that their stellar mass built - up and so feedback history may be different ( e.g. , for s0 galaxies , @xcite ) .",
    "it is still not clear if this difference in sf history can significantly affect the observed coronal properties , or their relations to other galaxy properties ( e.g. , the @xmath7 and @xmath560 relations ; @xcite ) .",
    "the above uncertainties , either in the measurement of sfr or the different sf histories , may result in additional scatters in the following correlation analysis ( paper  ii ) .",
    "in addition to the global sfr , another key property of sf is its specific intensity ( sfr per unit area or unit mass ) , which is often traced by the ir warmth ( @xmath547 , a measurement of dust temperature ) @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising that the sfr correlates well with the ir warmth ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sample]a ) , since a galaxy with a higher sfr also tends to have a higher sf intensity",
    ". however , this correlation has a large dispersion , which suggests that other factors such as the sf mode ( e.g. , nuclear starburst vs. disk - wide star forming ) may affect the observed ir properties .",
    "we will thus use both the ir luminosity and warmth to define the starburst subsample (  [ paperisubsubsec : subsample ] ) .",
    "galaxy mass is often described in two ways : the stellar mass ( responsible for old stellar feedback ) and the gravitational mass ( related to the gravitational confinement ) , which are closely correlated with each other ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use the _",
    "2mass _ k - band luminosity @xcite and the color - dependent mass - to - light ratio @xcite to estimate the stellar mass ( @xmath4 , table  [ table : basicparaii ] ) .",
    "the application of this method is somewhat inaccurate for edge - on galaxies , especially starburst ones , because the extinction can be strong , even in near - ir .",
    "the uncertainty in the mass estimate can lead to scatters in the subsequent statistical analysis .",
    "the baryon mass ( @xmath561 ) is estimated from the rotation velocity ( @xmath562 in table  [ table : sampleselectionpara ] ) together with the baryon tully - fisher relation , which represents a tight correlation between the total baryon mass ( though only contributions from stars and cool ism are included ; fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxymass ] ) and the rotation velocity of spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relation implies an approximate constancy of the baryon to gravitational mass ratio in such galaxies .",

    "we emphasize that the accuracy of the mass obtained this way may be affected by other factors : ( 1 ) the galaxy inclination correction of @xmath562 in _ hyperleda _ is conducted using the inclination angle defined in optical ( @xmath563 in table  [ table : sampleselectionpara ] ) , which may be different from those of or h@xmath556 gases .",

    "the gas in such a galaxy may be strongly disturbed .",
    "consequently , their @xmath562 and mass may not follow the tully - fisher relation . ( 3 ) s0 galaxies may not be well described by the tully - fisher relation , which is defined only for spiral galaxies .",
    "we have double - checked the published rotation curves of some galaxies in our sample ( e.g. , @xcite ) and found that their flattening velocities are consistent with @xmath562 as given in _",

    "for each galaxy , the coronal gas density , @xmath1303 , is inferred from the emission measure and further interpolated into the galactic disk following the soft x - ray intensity profile .",
    "physically , the emission measure anti - correlates with the absolute abundance which is poorly constrained in low - resolution soft x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "therefore , the absolute value of @xmath1303 is meaningful only if both the absolute abundance and the volume filling factor @xmath1307 can be well constrained .",

    "the assumption of solar metallicity of oxygen (  [ paperisubsec : spec ] ) then only has limited effects on the measured @xmath1303 .",
    "furthermore , due to the possible existence of higher temperature hot gas @xcite , even if a pressure balance is reached , as often assumed in the estimation of @xmath1303 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the soft x - ray - emitting gas of a galactic corona is still expected to have a volume filling factor far below unity @xcite .",

    "this means we have detected only a small fraction of the feedback material ( the `` missing galactic feedback problem '' , see @xcite and references therein ) , which prevents us from quantitatively understanding the galactic feedback .",
    "_ radiative cooling timescale _ : there are two possible fates of the coronal gas , either blown out into the intergalactic space or fall back to the galactic disk .",
    "the radiative cooling timescale ( @xmath1306 ) and the dynamical timescale of the global gas flows describe the relative importance of these two possibilities .",
    "the speed of the galactic outflow , if there is any , can not be directly measured with the existing x - ray data . however , in simulations of hot gas outflows around starburst galaxies @xcite or low / intermediate - mass galactic spheroids @xcite , the outflow velocity can often reach several @xmath1315 or even @xmath1316 .",
    "this velocity corresponds to a dynamical timescale of @xmath1317 , assuming a corona size of @xmath1318 .",
    "although @xmath1306 is proportional to @xmath1319 , it is _ unlikely _ to be globally smaller than this dynamical timescale ( the typical value of @xmath1306 is @xmath1320 , table  [ table:1tspec ] ) .",

    "a significant fraction of the hot gas may not have sufficiently high velocities ( typically a few @xmath1321 ) to overcome the galaxy s gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "this gas tends to interact with the surrounding cool ism and lost its energy radiatively , largely responsible for the observed soft x - ray emission .",
    "it is thus still possible that a significant fraction of the coronal gas may cool down within @xmath1306 and fall back to the galactic disk .",

    "the multi - phase nature of the hot gas in nearby galaxies is suggested by both observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) and simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the temperature distribution of this multi - phase gas is usually robustly characterized with the low quality x - ray spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the fitted temperatures ( often with a simple 1-t thermal plasma model ) are thought to be significantly biased from the commonly used definitions of average temperature ( e.g. , luminosity - weighted or emission - measure - weighted temperature ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we need to test how such possible bias may affect our results .",
    "the multi - temperature thermal plasma is most likely produced by the interaction between the sn - driven superwind and the ambient cool ism @xcite .",
    "we thus test a 2-t plasma model for late - type galaxies ; early - type ones are typically poor in cool gas and are expected to have a relatively simple thermal state .",
    "[ fig : spec2 t ] presents the spectra of 16 galaxies for which the 2-t plasma model gives significantly different results from the 1-t model , while table  [ table : specpara2 t ] lists the fitted parameters .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : spec2 t ] ) . nevertheless , this systematical difference is only about 25% , typically comparable to or even less than the measurement uncertainty in the luminosity of a corona .",
    "therefore , even if the 2-t plasma model represents a better description of the coronal thermal state , the luminosity obtained from the 1-t fit is still a good approximation of the coronal emission .",
    "we also check the adequacy of the 1-t model in characterizing the _ thermal state _ of a corona .",
    "we define the luminosity weighted temperature of the 2-t model as : @xmath1323 , where subscripts @xmath1324 and @xmath1325 refer to the low - t and high - t components . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : test2t]b , @xmath1326 is generally consistent with @xmath1311 , showing no significant bias within the errors .",
    "the large errors of @xmath1326 for some galaxies are due to the uncertainty in the decomposition of the two thermal components .",
    "therefore , the temperature obtained from the 1-t model typically gives an adequate characterization of the mean thermal state of a corona with the limited quality of the data .",
    "the galactic coronae , and even the igm , are thought to be metal enriched by various types of stellar ejecta ( e.g. , massive stellar wind , planetary nebula , and sn ejecta ) .",
    "therefore , the metal abundance pattern of the coronal gas can be affected by many factors , such as the competition of different metal sources and how different phases of gas mix with each other ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "different abundance ratios ( e.g. , fe / o ) have been observed in different types of galaxies .",
    "some of the ratios are significantly different from the solar values , indicating recent enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the absolute metal abundance of the coronal gas is typically poorly constrained because the continuum , dominated by the bremsstrahlung of free elections from hydrogens , can hardly be detected in soft x - ray at the low resolution of a typical ccd spectrum ; grating spectra , as can be obtained for some relatively compact bright galaxies with deep _ xmm - newton _",
    "rgs observations , can not help much , because the continuum emission from point - like sources can not be easily subtracted ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the fe / o ratio ( fe and o are often employed as the most important products of ia and cc sne , representing the feedbacks from old and young stellar populations ) can be readily measured ; but its interpretation can still be complicated .",
    "for example , @xcite show that the uncertainty in the thermal state ( e.g. , the need for a second temperature component to represent the temperature range of the hot gas ) can significantly affect the measured iron abundance ( the fe - bias ) , but little on the oxygen abundance . in a typical 1-t model ,",
    "this effect can increase the uncertainty of the measured fe / o value by as large as @xmath1327 .",
    "all the above uncertainties in the metal abundance measurement may strongly affect the estimation of other coronal properties ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then check how the assumption of fe / o ratio in the 1-t model (  [ paperisubsubsec : spectraanalysis ] ) affects the measurements of the luminosity and temperature .",
    "[ fig : testmetal ] shows that the luminosity and temperature with or without the fe / o ratio fixed are generally consistent with each other .",
    "the only exception is ngc  5866 . for this galaxy ,",
    "the temperature fitted with the abundance ratio fixed is substantially greater than that if it is allowed to vary .",
    "indeed , the galaxy has been reported in a detailed study to have a strong fe  l line bump while no detectable oxygen lines @xcite .",
    "more sensitive spectroscopic observations are needed to understand such an unusual abundance pattern in this cool - gas - rich s0 galaxy .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty in the thermal and chemical states , a probably more important factor in the measurement of hot gas properties arises from the residual stellar contribution .",
    "the model of the stellar component ( cv+ab , as well as the power law accounting for both the unresolved lmxb and the residual background ) has both thermal and power law components with different relative contributions in different galaxies (  [ paperisubsec : spec ] ) .",
    "in addition , the specific contribution of faint stellar sources in soft x - ray ( per stellar mass ) may also vary in different types of galaxies ( e.g. , due to different sf history ) .",
    "this uncertainty can be as large as @xmath1328 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for galaxies in which a large fraction of the `` diffuse '' x - ray emission comes from unresolved stellar sources , the hot gas properties obtained from the spectral analysis can have large systematic errors ( e.g. , for ngc  3115 ,  [ paperisec : individual ] , @xcite ) .",
    "our focus here is at characterizing the average properties of the coronae ( luminosity , average temperature , and fe / o ratio ) , instead of studying the specific thermal and chemical states ( temperature distribution and absolute abundance of different elements ) .",
    "therefore , we believe that a simplified 1-t model with fixed abundance ratio plus stellar contributions is an optimal choice for a unform , statistical analysis of the galactic coronae",
    ".      our measurement may also depend on the inclination angle of a galaxy .",
    "the diverse of inclination of the present sample may affect the volume estimate , the filtering of the galactic disk , and so the correction of the measurement .",
    "we have checked the dependence of the measured hot gas properties on the inclination angle ( @xmath563 ) to investigate any possible inclination bias . as an example ( the most significant dependence on @xmath563 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : test_incli]a shows that @xmath1303 seems to be slightly correlated with @xmath563 ; but the correlation is only marginal ( @xmath1329 ) and probably dominated by only a few galaxies with high @xmath1303 values .",
    "[ fig : test_incli]b further indicates that the difference between highly and moderately inclined galaxies ( divided by @xmath1330 ) may be real , but a simple geometric correction can not account for this difference ( fig .",
    "[ fig : test_incli]c ) .",
    "this possible systematical bias , if not dominated by several extreme cases , could be attributed to the contamination from outer disk emission in moderately - inclined galaxies (  [ paperisubsec : spatial ] , [ paperisubsec : spec ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , such potential inclination biases are generally small , compared to the measurement uncertainty itself , as well as uncertainties caused by the intrinsic diversities in the coronal morphologies ( e.g. , the lopsidedness ) or physical / chemical states .",
    "therefore , we have made _ no _ attempt to systematically correct for any inclination effects on our measurements .",
    "we will instead compare high and moderate inclined galaxies in the subsequent statistical analysis ( paper  ii ) .",
    "we further consider the potential effects of agn on the _ coronal _ properties .",
    "agn may affect our analysis in two different ways , either via the scattered light of the central x - ray bright point source , or via various forms of feedback ( ejection or heating of the surrounding gas caused by the radiation , winds and/or jets , @xcite ) . as presented in ",
    "[ paperisec : sampleselection ] , none of our sample galaxy has nuclear source bright enough that its scattered light ( wings of psf and ccd readout steak ) may dominate the truly diffuse coronal x - ray emission .",
    "in fact , we benefit from the large inclination angle in the sample selection that most of the x - ray emission from agn may have already been blocked by the cool gas in the disk .    on the other hand , various forms of feedback from the agn may affect the galaxy environment significantly ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , so potentially affect our x - ray analysis of the galactic coronae .",
    "generally , there are two major modes of agn feedback ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ radiative mode _",
    "( also known as the quasar or wind mode ) mainly operates when the accreting black hole is close to the eddington limit .",
    "although it is sometimes suggested that the radiation from agn could be responsible for some extended x - ray features even as far as several kpc from the nucleus , by the photo - ionization and fluorescence of the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , this mode typically has the most significant effect on the dense cool gas in the inner part of a galaxy .",
    "little evidence is currently revealed for the direct interaction between these relatively homogenous wind and the large scale hot gas .",
    "we thus neglect it from the direct effects on the corona .",
    "the other mode is known as the _ kinetic mode _ ( or jet / radio mode ) .",
    "there are many observational evidence ( e.g. , x - ray jet and filaments ) for the direct interaction between the jet and the hot halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , many agn blowout superbubbles are also detected in the hot surrounding medium of _ massive _ galaxies located in the center of cool core clusters , which plays an important role in shaping the circumgalactic environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also some lines of evidence that the diffuse x - ray morphology is correlated with the radio / x - ray luminosities of agns in normal elliptical galaxies , which may indicate that the coronal gas is disturbed by agn and thus departs from hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "such a radio mode agn feedback may even be energetic enough to unbind a significant fraction of the igm in galaxy groups @xcite , so explain the breaking of self - similarity observed in the scaling relations between the gravitational mass and some hot gas properties of massive clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in spite of these lines of observational evidence , which are mostly for massive elliptical galaxies , we do not find much evidence for prominent agn feedback features in our sample of disk galaxies .",
    "there are several exceptions (  [ paperisec : individual ] ) , such as the @xmath1314kpc scale limb - brightened nuclear bubble of ngc  3079 @xcite , the small nuclear bubble of ngc  4438 @xcite , the coincidence between the radio bubble and diffuse x - ray emission of ngc  6764 @xcite , etc . in most cases , such structures do not significantly affect our measurements of the global properties of the relevant individual coronae .",
    "furthermore , agn feedback is often _ energetically _ less important ( than sn feedback ) in galaxies with small or intermediate mass bulges ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as is the case for most of the present sample galaxies ( refer to  [ paperisec : sampleselection ] for details ) .",
    "we thus believe that agn feedback only have limited _ direct _ effect on the coronal x - ray emission .",
    "in addition to the _ direct _ effect on the coronal x - ray emission , agn feedback could also have strong effects on various galaxy properties , which may then affect the coronae _",
    "indirectly_. for example , the intense flux of photons and particles produced by the agn may sweep the cool gas in the galaxy , or at least keep the gas hot and reduce radiative cooling , therefore quench the sf ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "strong agn feedback can also reduce the accretion and stifle the fuel supply onto the supermassive bh , then terminates the nuclear activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "all these changing of galaxy properties ( e.g. , sf and nuclear activity ) may have potential effects on the coronal properties , e.g. , by changing the stellar feedback rate or the global accretion rate from the igm ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , here we only consider the direct interaction between agn and the coronal gas ( such as heating , mass injection , and compression , etc . ; e.g. , @xcite ) , while leaving the discussions of the scatters caused by various indirect effects to the correlation analysis between the coronal properties and various galaxy properties ( paper  ii )",
    ".    it may be helpful to statistically compare the coronal x - ray luminosity and temperature measurements of the galaxies with or without agn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : testagn ] ; the classification of the galaxies plotted in the figure is based on @xcite ) .",
    "we find that the median values of @xmath3 and @xmath1311 for these two subsamples do not show significant differences ( @xmath1331 higher in @xmath3 for galaxies with agns and no noticeable difference in @xmath1311 ) .",
    "in contrast , starburst and non - starburst galaxies are indeed distinguishable statistically ( different by 0.7  dex in @xmath3 and 0.16  kev in @xmath1311 ) .",
    "we thus conclude that _ agns are generally less important than sf in regulating the coronal properties of our sample galaxies_.      there are growing lines of evidence that the cxe ( also called charge transfer ) makes a non - negligible contribution to the x - ray line emission in various sorts of astrophysical objects ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the cxe describes a process in which a highly ionized ion ( e.g. , ) takes one or more electrons from another atom ( like h , @xmath1332 , or he ) , which can be represented by : @xmath1333 .",
    "such a process will produce an excited ion @xmath1334 , which emits x - ray photons as it decays to the ground state .",
    "extensive studies have been carried out on the solar wind cxe and its contribution to the x - ray emission of some solar system objects , as well as to the galactic soft x - ray background ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the cxe has further been speculated to be important in many other types of astrophysical objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . according to the diffuse x - ray emission from nearby galaxies",
    ", it has been shown that a substantial fraction of it can not arise from optically - thin thermal plasma , but may originate in the cxe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the spatial correlation between some cool / hot gas features , especially in active sf galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "existence of the cxe will not only affect the spectral modeling of specific line emissions , but more important to this work , also potentially significantly enhance the global soft x - ray emission .",
    "the cxe produces only line emission , which can not be well separated from the thermal emission in a low resolution ccd spectrum . for example , the relative strengthes of the forbidden ( @xmath1335 ) and inter - combination ( @xmath1336 ) lines to the resonance line ( @xmath1337 ) of the  k@xmath556 triplet is often adopted as a spectral diagnostic for the presence of the cxe @xcite . while the cxe is closely related to the presence of cool gas , the amount of cool gas can not be used as a direct diagnostic parameter of the cxe strength .",
    "this is because the amount of cool gas is often tightly correlated with the sfr ( e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : sftracer]b ) , or other cool - hot gas interaction processes , such as mass loading and turbulent mixing , which all enhance radiative cooling ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , since all these processes are more or less related to sf , we may expect that some enhanced cool / hot gas features , especially in low - density environments ( where the thermal emission is relatively weak ) , may originate in the cxe .",
    "a few apparent candidates for significant cxe contributions present in our sample .",
    "the analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ rgs spectra of m82 has shown that the contributions of the cxe are about 90% , 50% , and 30% to the , , and triplets , respectively @xcite .",
    "although the grating spectral analysis is focused chiefly on the central region ( typically @xmath1338 from the nucleus ) , it is still expected that a considerable fraction of the coronal soft x - ray line emission may arise from the cxe . in particular , m82 is located within a complex of gas , formed apparently from the tidal interaction among members of the m81 group @xcite ; a large number of interfaces , generated by expected strong interaction between the gas and the galactic superwind , may lead to strong cxe emission .",
    "similarly , for the disk - wide starburst galaxy , ngc  4631 , the measured line ratio is also consistent with a cxe origin @xcite .",
    "another possible example of a significant cxe contribution is ngc  4438 .",
    "this galaxy is unusually x - ray bright ( @xmath1339 , compared to @xmath1340 of m82 and @xmath1298 of ngc  4594 ; table  [ table:1tspec ] ) for its moderate stellar mass ( @xmath1341 , compared to @xmath1342 of ngc  4594 ) and sfr ( @xmath1343 , compared to @xmath1344 of m82 ) .",
    "it is located in the virgo cluster and shows tidal interaction with a companion galaxy ngc  4435 (  [ paperisec : individual ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cool / hot gas features are also spatially correlated @xcite . in contrast , galaxies undergoing tidal interaction and cool gas transfer from companions , but located in non - cluster environments ( e.g. , ngc  5775 ) , do not have such well - matched cool / hot gas features ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we thus speculate that the enhanced x - ray emission may at least partly arise from the cxe between the stripped cool gas and the hot icm .    due to the scarcity of high - quality , high - resolution spectroscopic observations and the lack of suitable spectral models @xcite , the contribution of cxe to the total diffuse x - ray luminosity",
    "can hardly be constrained in individual galaxies or in a sample . however , at least in some cases , this component appears to be non - negligible .",
    "we have conducted a systematical data reduction and analysis of the _ chandra _ data of 53 nearby disk galaxies , of which 20 are presented for the first time to study the _ diffuse _ soft x - ray emission .",
    "this sample covers broad ranges of sfr ( @xmath1345 ) , stellar mass ( @xmath1346 ) , and other galaxy properties .",
    "the sample size is much larger than those of previous studies of similar types of galaxies ( typically @xmath1347 galaxies ) .",
    "we have conducted uniform data calibration of all the galaxies .",
    "in particular , discrete point - like sources are detected and removed , while significant contributions from unresolved stellar sources are carefully estimated for different types of galaxies , allowing for a spectral analysis of the truly diffuse hot gas emission . based on these calibrations ,",
    "we have provided measurements of various diffuse soft x - ray properties of the galactic coronae , including both the directly measured parameters from the spatial and spectral analysis ( scale height , luminosity , and temperature ) , and some derived parameters ( density , mass , thermal energy , and radiative cooling timescale ) .",
    "notable properties are highlighted for individual galaxies .",
    "our products ( images , spectra , brightness profiles , and measured hot gas parameters ) form a comprehensive database for the study of the galactic coronae .",
    "we have also discussed various corrections and complications in the measurements . in particular , we have investigated the effects caused by uncertainties in the thermal and chemical states of the hot gas . we find that a simple 1-t model with fixed abundance ratio plus stellar contributions is typically sufficient to characterize the overall properties of the coronal emission .",
    "the different inclination angles of our sample galaxies may cause a small systematical bias due to the potential contamination from the disk emission / absorption in moderately inclined galaxies .",
    "but this bias can not play a significant role in determining the coronal properties .",
    "several galaxies in our sample host agns ; some of them may even be responsible for distinct diffuse x - ray features .",
    "but in general , agn feedback is less important than sf feedback for our sample of disk galaxies ; the presence of the diffuse x - ray features related to agn does not significantly affect our measurements of the global coronal properties .",
    "the cxe may significantly contribute to the soft x - ray emission in some of the galaxies , either active in sf or not .",
    "in particular , the unusually high x - ray luminosity of the tidally disturbed gas - rich virgo cluster member ngc  4438 is most likely due to the cxe .",
    "further insights into the origin of the coronae can be obtained from a statistical analysis of the measurements , together with other galaxy parameters , which is the topic of paper  ii .",
    "we thank the referee for his / her constructive comments and suggestions , which are very helpful in the revision of the paper .",
