    "the retirement of many experienced photometrists worldwide and the closure of many small telescopes used in their studies has led to a decline in recent photometric monitoring of cepheid variables . at the same time",

    "photometric monitoring of bright cepheids ( _ e.g. _ , polaris ) was initiated at the bgo in 2003 @xcite with the acquisition of an optec ssp-3 solid state photometer , and the ccd program was extended to fainter objects in winter and summer 2006 , including unstudied suspected cepheid variables . in september 2006",
    "the ccd monitoring program was moved to the 0.3-m celestron telescope of the automated abbey ridge observatory @xcite , and presently collects a few hours of observation of cepheids and other suspected variables on every available clear night  amounting to several hundred hours of monitoring each year .",

    "regular monitoring from the aro to establish its rate of period change revealed curious temporal changes in mean brightness of the star that , while perhaps typical of type ii variables @xcite , may be linked to the star s unusual binarity : 35 @xmath1 companion in a close @xmath2 orbit @xcite .",
    "the light curve for six times the present @xmath3 pulsation period ( fig .  [ ixcas ] ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 , displays sinusoidal variations similar to nearside heating in close binaries , and averaging of the same data ( to remove the pulsational variations ) phased to the @xmath2 orbital period suggests the possibility of eclipses in the system .",
