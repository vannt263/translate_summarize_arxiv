    "developing a coherent model for the mass assembly of galaxies over cosmic time is a complex and difficult task .",
    "it is difficult because developing such a coherent model involves highly non - linear physics ( e.g. , the cooling and collapse of baryons , or feedback from stars and super - massive blackholes which regulate both the growth of the stellar mass and black holes themselves ) and all over a very wide range of physical scales ( from large scale structure to star clusters to black holes ) .",
    "our knowledge of galaxy formation _ in situ _ relies mostly on observations of integrated quantities , which is insufficient to understand the details of the process of formation , e.g. , the interplay between the baryonic and dark matter , or the complex physics of baryons such as merging , star formation , feedback , various instabilities and heating / cooling mechanisms , etc . at the heart of our developing understanding of galaxy evolution is the relative importance of secular evolution through ( quasi-)adiabatic accretion of mass , instabilities , and resonances ( e.g. , @xcite ) , versus more violent evolution through merging ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as a function of look - back time .",
    "because of the complexity of the processes involved , understanding the mass assembly of galaxies over cosmic time requires constraining a wide range of phenomenology for large samples of objects . in this respect",
    "integral field spectroscopy is particularly well suited in that it allows us to map the spatially resolved physical properties of galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , splitting the light into many channels in a integral field spectrograph requires long integration times , even on large telescopes , to detect low surface brightness emission .",
    "thus , conducting large statistical studies necessary for understanding the processes driving galaxy evolution will demand a high multiplex capability to efficiently investigate sufficient numbers of objects .    using current facilities on 8 m class telescopes ,",
    "it is already possible to map the physical properties of distant galaxies .",
    "for example , flames / giraffe on the vlt offers the unique ability to observe 15 distant galaxies simultaneously . the first ( complete ) 3d sample of galaxies at moderate redshifts has revealed a large fraction ( @xmath040% ) of all z@xmath00.6 galaxies with @xmath1 - 19.5 have perturbed or complex kinematics ( @xcite ) .",
    "this population of dynamically disturbed galaxies is most probably a result of a high prevalence of mergers and merger remnants ( see also @xcite ) . at higher redshift , integral field spectroscopy of several objects has been obtained using single object integral field spectrographs available on 8 - 10 meter class telescopes ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , many of these data sets were obtained with limited spatial resolution sampling galaxies on scales of a few kpc , and the true dynamical nature of many sources sampled at these spatial and spectral resolutions remains uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ".    improving and extending this approach to the general understanding of the nature of faint galaxies and to galaxies in the early universe will require a new generation of multi - object integral field spectrographs working in the near - ir , with increased sensitivity and better spatial resolution on even larger telescopes . because of the complex interplay between spatial and spectral features and our limited knowledge of high redshift galaxies , it is helpful , perhaps necessary , to rely on numerical simulations for constraining the design parameters of this new kind of instrument .",
    "for this purpose , we have developed software that simulate end - to - end the emission line characteristics of local galaxies and numerical simulations of galaxies to show how they would appear in the distant universe . by changing various parameters like the resolution , pixel scale , and point spread function it is possible to constrain the instrumental characteristics and performance against a set of galaxy characteristics ( e.g. , velocity field ) .",
    "this paper is the first in a series to investigate the scientific design requirements of possible future instruments , telescope aperture and design , and site characteristics appropriate for constrain how galaxies grew and evolved with cosmic time . in this paper in particular , we aim to present the details of our assumptions that go into the software , as well as a first attempt to constrain some of the high level specification for a hypothetical but realistic multi - object integral field spectrograph assisted by moao system . because 2d kinematics ( i.e. , velocity field and velocity dispersion maps ) are one of the most obvious and easiest to currently simulate , they provide the most straight forward way of constraining the high level science design requirements for this type of instrument .",
    "we emphasize that the goal of this paper is not to study the detailed scientific capability of such instruments .",
    "instead , the present paper aims at examining a few scientifically motivated cases to derive relevant specifications for such types of instruments with a capable moao system .",
    "these specifications will then be adopted as a baseline for studying their scientific capabilities subsequent papers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we detail the goals of this study and our methodology ; in sect .",
    "3 we present the new simulation pipeline and in sect . 4 how moao psfs are simulated ; in sect .",
    "5 we describe the kinematic measurements ; in sect . 6 and 7 ,",
    "we present the simulations and their results , which are discussed in sect . 8 . in sect .",
    "9 , we draw the conclusions of this study .",
    "most of current dynamical studies of distant galaxies are severely hampered by their limited spatial resolution , which introduces an important uncertainty as to their dynamical nature as discussed in the introduction .",
    "a moao - fed integral field spectrograph on the vlt and/or the e - elt will improve substantially the spatial resolution compared to non - ao assisted observations .",
    "the concept of moao was first proposed in the falcon design study , a multi objects 3d spectrograph intended for the vlt @xcite .",
    "briefly , the main objectives of the falcon concept was to obtain 3d spectroscopy of distant emission line galaxies , up to @xmath2 .",
    "doing this requires us to observe in the near infrared since all of the important optical emission lines from [ oii]@xmath33727   to h@xmath4 are redshifted into the atmospheric windows from 0.8 to 2.5 @xmath5 m ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . because the intrinsic size of distant galaxies is small",
    ", ao is needed to spatially resolve emission lines and thus to keep the spectroscopic signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) high enough to detect small features . correcting a large field of view ( fov ) to observe many galaxies simultaneously is challenging and normal single natural guide star ao is not sufficient .",
    "moao is a method for obtaining excellent correction over a relatively large fov ( @xmath6few arcmin ) .",
    "the basis of this concept is to correct only regions where the targets lie , instead of correcting the entire fov of the instrument .",
    "moao uses atmospheric tomography techniques @xcite meaning several wave - front sensors ( wfs ) for each integral field unit ( ifu ) measure the off - axis wavefront coming from stars located within the fov , and the on - axis wavefront from the galaxy is deduced from off - axis measurements and corrected by an ao system within the optical train of each ifu .",
    "a detailed description of falcon can be found in @xcite .",
    "the general concept of moao was subsequently adapted to the future european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) in the wfspec study @xcite , which was a precursor to the current eagle concept .",
    "one of the most important goals in setting the science design requirements for eagle is mapping the physical properties of galaxies up to z@xmath05 , in order to better understand the processes that drive the evolution of galaxies .      as a first study",
    ", we want to help derive high - level design specifications for the eagle and falcon moao - fed instruments by addressing the following :    * explore the necessary order of magnitude of integration times that will be required to reliably derive the kinematics of distant emission line galaxies , allowing their classification ; * by selecting a simple rotating disk with little substructure and a merger simulation with two overlapping disks , explore the most relaxed requirements for the design of the instrument in terms of the necessary adaptive optics performance and coarseness of the pixel scale . to this end",
    "we have limited our simulations to spatial sampling of 50 - 75 mas pixel@xmath7 ; * help constrain the requirements on the moao system by specifying its spectroscopic coupling ( which is defined here as the ensquared energy [ ee ] per element of the spatial resolution , see sect .",
    "a detailed study of the scientific capabilities of these instruments is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we want to use a limited number of comparisons between scientifically motivated cases in order to help derive the most relaxed high - level specifications .",
    "flux is the zero - order moment of an emission line , while the velocity and width are the first and second moment , and higher order moments always have more relative uncertainty .",
    "for this reason , kinematics will set stringent requirements on the snr necessary to fully characterize faint extended emission line gas .",
    "the characteristics of these moments depend on the underlying source of an emission line s excitation and kinematics .",
    "because the most easily reached goal of moao - fed spectrographs will be to understand the kinematics of the emission line gas in galaxies , a natural kinematic reference case for such a study is a simple spiral rotating disk . in the following",
    "we will use fabry - perot observations of the local rotating disk ugc5253 taken as part of the ghasp survey ( @xcite ; see its main photometric and dynamical properties in tab .",
    "[ tabghasp ] ; see also fig .",

    "[ ee_fwhm_elt ] . note that when ee@xmath630% , the fwhm becomes lower than 0.25 arcsec ( i.e. , twice the pixel size ) .",
    "this means that when ee@xmath630% , the spatial resolution is oversampled at twice the ifu pixel size .",
    "this is why , in the following , all ee are computed in a 0.25 arcsec size aperture . finally , pct becomes smaller than 50% for ee@xmath035% , which is the limit for a good `` psf contrast '' in the falcon case , at a pixel scale of 0.25 arcsec .",
    "the dashed lines show when the spatial resolution , as measured by the fwhm , is lower than 0.25 arcsec , i.e. , twice the pixel size .",

    "pct vs. ee for the eight simulated falcon psfs .",
    "the left most point corresponds to the seeing limited psf .",
    "the black line is a linear fit between the pct and the ee.,width=302 ]",
    "the simulated data - cubes are analyzed using a data analysis pipeline similar to those generally used to analyze data of high redshift galaxies . during this process ,",
    "each spatial pixel of the simulated data - cube is fitted with a gaussian in wavelength , whose position and width correspond to the velocity and velocity dispersion of the gas in this spatial pixel .",
    "because the accuracy of these measurements is driven by the flux within the emission line relative to the noise in the continuum , one has to define a kinematic signal - to - noise ratio @xmath8 specific for this measurement .",
    "we chose to rely on the definition of @xcite , who defined @xmath8 as the total flux in the emission line divided by the noise on the continuum @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the number of pixels within the emission line .",
    "we emphasize that this @xmath8 is different from the classical @xmath11 , as defined in sect .",
    "3.3 : the latter quantifies the signal to noise ratio relative to the sky and detector noise ( detectability of the emission line ) , while the former characterizes the capability of measuring the first and second order moments of the emission line , relative to the noise in the continuum @xcite .",
    "although they are different in nature , we find that both snrs roughly correlates provided that @xmath12 ( corresponding the @xmath133 - 4 ) . because a lot of data - cubes are simulated and need to be analyzed , one has to rely on a fully automatic analysis pipeline .",
    "tests show that pixels with a `` kinematic '' @xmath14 3 have very large errors mostly due to misidentification of emission lines with noise peaks .",
    "hence , only pixels having a @xmath8 of at least three have been kept for further analysis .      to help distinguish between the two kinematic templates ( i.e. , the major merger and the rotating disk ) , we fitted a rotating disk model to each velocity field .",
    "this model assumes a constant dynamical center , pa , inclination , and @xmath15 over the galaxy , and a simple _ arctan _ shape for the rotation curve . during the fit ,",
    "the pixels of the velocity field are weighted by the corresponding error in bins of snr , which were determined using monte - carlo simulations . finally , the residuals between the velocity field and the fitted model are derived , together with the reduced @xmath16 map .",
    "we then adopted two criteria for judging whether or not the fit to a particular simulated galaxy is appropriate .",
    "because we are interested only in large - scale motions ( i.e. , circular rotation vs. non - structured motions ) , we need to adopt a criterion not affected by smaller - scale variations due to non - circular perturbations like , e.g. , spiral arms or bars . for characterizing the 2d - fit as a whole , we therefore rely on the median @xmath17 over the galaxy .",
    "when smaller than unity , it means than at least 50% of the pixels on the velocity field are reliably fitted by a rotating disk model , and that galaxy motions are actually dominated by circular rotation .",
    "in addition , we choose to compare the distance between the fitted dynamical center and the velocity dispersion barycenter .",
    "we used such a criterion because in the case of data which are heavily smoothed by the seeing , a process that leads to more complex dynamics like merging would only rarely have its dynamical center of the entire system coincident with the maximum in the distribution of velocity dispersions .",
    "for this , we derived the associated uncertainty , using classical propagation of errors due to the uncertainties on the dynamical center fit and on the sigma barycenter .",
    "we then derived a parameter @xmath18 defined as the distance between the fitted dynamical center and the velocity dispersion barycenter , normalized by the corresponding uncertainty . having @xmath19 means that the fitted dynamical center is found close enough to the sigma barycenter location relative to the associated uncertainty , to be considered as compatible with the dynamics of a rotating disk .    in summary ,",
    "the kinematics of a galaxy can be considered as compatible with that of a rotating disk , provided that it falls on a region of a `` diagnostic diagram '' ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) where the median normalized residual is smaller than one , and provided that @xmath20 1 .",
    "we need to emphasize that this classification ( as any ) is not without limitations . as an example , let us consider a merging pair of galaxies .",
    "if both progenitors are equally distant from the center of mass of the system , the velocity dispersion map will show two peaks equally distant from this center , and the resulting barycenter of the sigma map may then be found very close to the dynamical center of orbital motions between the two progenitors if the separation of the two is small compared to the intrinsic resolution of the data and the exact distribution of the emission line gas .",
    "of course , that is a limitation of most techniques as it can be difficult to identify close merging pairs at high redshift .",
    "it is important to be aware that there are some configurations that are difficult to distinguish between .",
    "be that as it may , we use this approach as a first attempt in quantifying the rotation in very distant galaxies .",
    "it was decided not to simulate observations in the k - band as the detectability of lines in the thermal infrared is highly dependent on the achieved emissivity of the instrument . to generalize these first simulations and to remove additional free parameters , such as the telescope and instrumental emissivities and temperatures",
    ", we consider the h band only , assuming no thermal emission from the instrument and the telescope in the h - band .",
    "our tests show that this assumption leads to overestimate the snr in the h - band by no more than @xmath010% .",
    "this makes these first simulations less dependent of the telescope design ( e.g. , number of mirrors ) , environmental conditions ( site selection ) , and instrument characteristics ( e.g. , number of warm mirrors ) .",
    "moreover , working in the h - band will help disentangle spatial effects from flux limitation arising from the high thermal background in the k - band .    for this study",
    ", we assumed a spectral power of resolution @xmath21=5000 as a compromise between our desire to minimize the impact of the oh sky lines and not wanting to over - resolve the line by a large factor .",
    "moreover , appropriate targets in the nir are usually selected as they have emission lines that fall in regions free of strong oh lines .",
    "we estimated that about one third of the h - band is free from strong sky background variations ( i.e. , larger that 10% of the sky continuum ) in continuous windows of at least 200 km / s and is sampled at the nyquist rate .",
    "this gives a spectral power of resolution r@xmath022500 at @xmath3=9000@xmath22 . ] .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , all simulations have been performed without oh sky lines , accounting for the sky continuum only .",
    "usually , r=3000 is considered as a strict minimal spectral resolution to work between oh sky lines . in comparison",
    ", r=5000 will allow a better sky subtraction and limit kinematic measurement ( i.e. , velocity and velocity dispersion ) uncertainties .",
    "in addition , for simplicity , we assume that the [ oii ] emission line is a single line , instead of a doublet .",
    "this does not influence any results presented here , as these are scaled with the _ total _ flux , i.e. the flux inside both lines of the doublet ( assuming the low density limit for the ratio of the two lines ) .",
    "the instrumental parameters of the simulation were set to typical values used in the ir ( see tab.[tabparam ] ) , relying on a cooled rockwell hawaii-2rg ir array working at @xmath080k , as described by @xcite .",
    "an array of this type is already used in sinfoni , and arrays with similar characteristics will be implemented in next vlt generation ir instruments such as hawk - i , kmos , or x - shooter .",
    "table [ tabparam ] summarizes the main parameters used in the simulations .",
    "previous studies of falcon have considered a pixel scale of 0.125 arcsec @xcite .",
    "we will thus adopt this scale in the following . for eagle , we chose to firstly explore a pixel scale of 75 mas .",
    "this choice is suggested by recent 2d - kinematical studies of distant galaxies with giraffe , which show that a relatively coarse pixel scale can already provide us with enough information to properly recover large scale motions in distant galaxies , and then discriminate between simple rotating disks and major mergers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we conducted simulations at z=4 , where the [ oii ] emission line falls in the h band .",
    "both objects have been rescaled in half - light radius and flux to account for evolution and redshift ( see bottom of tab.[tabparam ] ) . @xcite and @xcite found that the typical r@xmath23 of z@xmath04 galaxies is @xmath00.2 arcsec in the uv .",
    "hence , we adopted an optical diameter of 0.8 arcsec for z@xmath04 galaxies ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the continuum magnitude was chosen considering @xcite , who studied z@xmath04 lyman break galaxies luminosity functions in the uv .",
    "they found a typical uv magnitude of 24.5 .",
    "we neglected any color corrections between uv and blue optical ( [ oii]@xmath33727 ) : as spiral spectral energy distributions [ seds ] rise from uv to optical , this choice can be considered as a minimal value for a typical pseudo - continuum for z@xmath04 galaxies .",
    "we assumed an integrated rest - frame equivalent - width ew@xmath25([oii])=30 , extrapolating the median values found in z@xmath261 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "this leads to an integrated emission line flux @xmath07.5@xmath2710@xmath28erg / s/@xmath29 ( observed - frame ) .",

    ", we looked at the sample of bm / bx galaxies of @xcite .",
    "we found 22 sources having a redshift between 1.4 and 1.8 , for which reddy et al .",
    "give j and k bands ab magnitudes .",
    "assuming that the h - band magnitude can roughly be approximated by an average between j and k bands magnitudes , we found in these 22 sources , a median ( mean ) h - band magnitude of 22.55 ( 22.56 ) .",
    "we can thus assume with some confidence that m@xmath32(h)=22.5 is quite representative of luminous z@xmath01.6 galaxies .",
    "this leads to an integrated emission line flux @xmath04.9@xmath2710@xmath33erg / s/@xmath29 ( observed - frame ) .",
    "finally , following @xcite , we assumed a typical half - light radius r@xmath23 of 0.5 arcsec in uv ( @xmath01500 ) for z@xmath01.6 galaxies .",
    "a similar value was found by @xcite at 2800 , with 0.4 arcsec for z=1.75 galaxies with m@xmath3410@xmath35m@xmath36 .",
    "we took 2 arcsec as a linear diameter for z@xmath01.6 galaxies , neglecting the k - morphological correction between uv and rest - frame optical ( h@xmath4 ) .",
    "the parameters adopted for the simulations are listed in tab .",
    "[ tabparam ] .",
    "as explained above , the effects of the psf on the data - cube are twofold . on one hand",
    ", the fwhm ( and the pct ) influences the spatial resolution of the observations . on the other hand",
    ", the ee strongly influences the number of photons reaching the detector . because the ee roughly correlates with the fwhm ( and the pct ) ,",
    "both effects are related .",
    "an easy way to distinguish them and to focus on spatial features is to simulate data - cubes with very large snrs .",
    "we therefore first ran a set of simulations with t@xmath37 200h : figure [ simelt200 ] shows the velocity fields , velocity dispersion maps , and emission line flux map for the z@xmath04 simulated rotating disk .",
    "the effect of the psf can clearly be seen on each of these three maps ( from left to right ) .",
    "more flux ( snr ) if brought toward the galaxy center , the `` spider '' shape of the isovelocities are more robustly recovered , and the peak at the dynamical center of the dispersion map is not so heavily smoothed as the correction increases .",
    "these effects are even clearer in the simulation of the major merger : the two peaks in the emission flux maps ( see also the velocity dispersion maps ) , which correspond to the two progenitors , are clearly better distinguished as the correction improved , as are the non - circular motions in the velocity field .",
    "the two progenitors can be distinguished provided that ee @xmath38 26% .",
    "it is worth to note that this ee corresponds to a fwhm smaller than 2 pixels ( see fig .",
    "[ ee_fwhm_elt ] ) , i.e. to a regime where the central diffraction peak is already formed ( see sect .",
    "as the two progenitors are separated by only 2 - 3 pixels , a poor correction mixes the two corresponding peaks in the emission line flux maps and/or the velocity dispersion maps .",
    "obviously , detecting smaller spatial - scale features would require a finer pixel scale .",
    "however , at a given pixel size , these simulations suggest that , from a purely spatial point of view ( i.e. at infinite snr ) , an optimal way to couple ao with 3d spectroscopy is to tune the moao system in order to get a psf whose fwhm is not larger than twice the pixel size . improving the correction further will not provide a better spatial resolution , but at that point a finer pixel scale may help ( see sect .",
    "4 ) . however",
    ", even with a relatively coarse sampling , a higher ee , will in turn lead to a higher snr in a given integration time : with realistic integration times , the optimal choice of ao correction must take into account achieving sufficient snr to detect low surface brightness regions .    to investigate the impact of the snr on the ao requirements ,",
    "we ran simulations with shorter total integration times : we adopted perhaps more realistic values of 24 and 8 hours . with an integration time of 24hr , the total snr over the entire galaxy ranges between @xmath011 and @xmath022 , depending on the ee ( see fig . [ snr_75mas ] ) .",
    "this snr goes down between @xmath07 and @xmath012 with 8hr of exposure time , scaling as the square root of the integration time , as expected . for a given surface brightness distribution and integration time",
    ", the snr scales linearly with ee , as expected in a background dominated regime . adopting a total snr of 5 as a lower limit to recover reliable and meaningful information over a galaxy",

    "this figure shows the effect of increasing the ee for a given integration time : it mainly increases the snr in the central part of the galaxy ( which has some structure fine enough to benefit from good ao correction ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the outer and lower surface brightness regions are much more difficult to recover : with 8hr of exposure time , emission lines are only detected over only a limited region of the galaxy ; at least 24hr are required to obtain full coverage of the galaxy or merger , i.e. , a snr of at least 3 in the outer parts .",
    "we find that at least 24hr and an ee of at least 34% are needed to recover the merger s low surface brightness tail ( see fig .",
    "[ eagle34 ] ) .",
    "we note that this ee corresponds to the ee required to have a pct smaller than 50% , i.e. , to have a good `` psf contrast '' , which limits the spectroscopic coupling between adjacent spectra ( see fig .",

    "we see that this partial information is sufficient to recover the dynamical nature of both the major merger and the rotating disk , for a large range of ee ( see fig .",
    "[ eltplot ] ) .",
    "although based on a limited number of cases , this suggests that it is not mandatory to recover the full 2d kinematics to infer the dynamical nature of distant galaxies .",
    "the dynamical state of a galaxy is mostly reflected in its large scale motions , rather than in its small scale perturbations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is why it appears sufficient to recover only part of the 2d information , providing that this information is reliable enough ( i.e. , recovered with enough snr ) .",

    "the two progenitors of the major merger can be clearly separated in both the @xmath41 and the [ oii ] maps ( see fig . [ simelt20050 ] ) with ee @xmath3815% ( in 0.1 arcsec ) , which again corresponds to the ee where the fwhm becomes smaller than two pixels .",

    "the black line is a linear fit between fwhm et ee.,width=302 ]        as expected , the achieved total snr at a given integration time and ee , is lower with a 50 mas pixel scale than with one of 75 mas pixel@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ snr_50mas ] ) . reaching a minimal total snr of 5",
    "requires at least 8hr of exposure time with an ee of 21% , or at least @xmath03hr with a larger ee .    with 50 mas pixel@xmath7",
    ", we find that the low surface brightness tidal tail of the merger can be detected in t@xmath39=24h with at least 32% of ee .",
    "in contrast to the previous cases , this ee does not correspond to the one giving 50% of pct : this condition now gives a much smaller ee ( smaller than 10 , see fig .",
    "[ ee_fwhm_elt2 ] ) , which does not provide enough snr to make this distinction ( fig .",
    "[ snr_50mas ] ) . with the 75 mas pixel@xmath7 scale , detecting the tidal tail required a total snr of @xmath015 : this is roughly the total snr that is now provided by 32% of ee with the 50 mas pixel@xmath7 scale .",
    "this is obviously related to subdividing the total flux of the tail into smaller and smaller sampling of a structure with a relatively smooth surface brightness distribution .             and 24 and 8 hr of exposure times (",
    "respectively : full lines , dashed lines , and dotted lines ) .",
    "the black curves correspond to the rotating disk , while the red ones correspond to the major merger.,width=302 ]    using the diagnostic diagram , it is possible to disentangle the major merger from the rotating disk with a pixel scale of 50 mas pixel@xmath7 ( see fig .",
    "[ eltplot2 ] ) .",
    "again , the diagnostic diagram tends to fail when the total snr is smaller than 5 ( see fig .",
    "[ snr_50mas ] ) .",
    "the comparison of the 50 and 75 mas pixel@xmath7 scales reveals that the former does not bring significant more information compared to the latter , relatively to the goal of distinguishing between the major merger and the rotating disk .",
    "this is related to the fact that , as mentioned before , the dynamical state of a galaxy is reflected in its large scale motions , rather than in its small scale perturbations .",
    "hence , having a very fine pixel scale does not provide any advantage in this respect , and might limit the snr achievable for a given integration time .",
    "obviously , such a conclusion depends on the spatial scale of the kinematic feature to be recovered : if one wants to recover smaller - scale kinematic details like , e.g. , the precise rotation curve , or to detect clumps in distant disks , a finer spatial scale will be then preferable . this optimal `` scale - coupling '' between the ifu pixel scale and the spatial scale of the physical feature that one wants to recover using this ifu can be quantified by the ratio between the size of this feature ( here , the galaxy diameter , as one wants to recover the large - scale rotation ) and the size of the ifu resolution element . at z@xmath04 , this `` scale - coupling ''",
    "is found to be 5.3 using the 75 mas pixel@xmath7 scale , and 8 , using the 50 mas pixel@xmath7 scale . in other words ,",
    "our simulations suggest that a `` scale - coupling '' of 5.3 is already large enough to recover large - scale motions in z@xmath04 galaxies .",
    "this is in line with 3d observations of z@xmath00.6 galaxies with flames / giraffe , which provides a `` scale - coupling '' of about 3 @xcite : this is the minimum value necessary to ensure that each side of the galaxy is at least spatially sampled by the ifu at the nyquist rate . using this minimum ratio",
    ", one finds that a pixel scale of at least @xmath0130 mas is mandatory for studying large - scale motions in z@xmath04 galaxies if they are simply scaled versions of nearby galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the smallest pixel scale that can be used for a given scientific goal is limited by the achievable snr at this scale , which is in turn constrained by the `` psf contrast '' as discussed above in sect .",
    "as discussed previously , in most cases moao will provide 3d spectroscopy of distant galaxies with a spatial resolution limited by the ifu pixel scale , because moao essentially provides partial ao corrections .",
    "everything else being equal , using a larger aperture telescope will then only influence the integration time needed to reach a given snr , thanks to the larger collecting power of the primary mirror .",
    "we show in sect .",
    "4 , that an moao - fed ifs on the vlt could provide us with improved 2d - kinematics of z@xmath422 galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ simeaglefalcon ] , we show what the maps of the same galaxy would look like if observed with eagle on the e - elt , using 50 mas pixel@xmath7 and t@xmath39=2h . observations , with 24% of ee in 0.1 arcsec , provide a radial snr profile comparable to the one obtained with falcon after 24hr of exposure time and ee=39% ( see fig .",
    "[ profsnr_comp ] ) .",
    "the e - elt , equipped with an multi - object ifs , even with a low ee , would represent a huge improvement over 8-meter class telescopes , even equipped with future - generation moao - fed instruments . in return , the vlt , equipped with an moao - fed spectrograph would provide us with an important advancement in our knowledge of distant galaxies , increasing the number of spatial element of resolution from typically 2 - 3 to 13 - 20 .",
    "this will be possible at the vlt with the laser guide star facility and sinfoni ( pixel scale of 50 mas ) .",
    "this is already available with osiris at keck ( with 20 to 100 mas pix@xmath7 ao - corrected ; see @xcite ) .",
    "other vlt second - generation nir spectrographs , such as kmos , will on the other hand allow us to gather further information on kinematics of 24 distant objects simultaneously , which is a great advantage in obtaining the statistical properties .",
    "however , it only has seeing limited performance over a 0.2 arcsec pixel@xmath7 scale .",
    "high spatial resolution integral field spectroscopy at the vlt will remain limited to single object observations .",
    "the number density of objects at z@xmath01.4 - 2.5 is expected to be @xmath0 9 per square arcmin , down to @xmath4325 @xcite .",
    "kmos will undoubtedly identify interesting objects amount the ensemble of z@xmath442 galaxies with which to observe in more detail with ao - fed integral field spectrographs on 8-m class telescopes .",
    "however , an moao - fed spectrograph on currently available or a future extremely large telescope would optimally take advantage of these high target densities .    1.6 , with t@xmath39=2h and ee=24% in 0.1 arcsec .",
    "for both objects , the velocity fields ( first column ) , velocity dispersion maps ( second column ) and emission line maps ( third column ) are shown .",
    "object size is 2 arcsec in diameter , which represents @xmath00.24 arcsec at z=1.6.,width=302 ]          we first presented simulations of z@xmath04 galaxies with very large snrs , to focus on spatial smoothing effects due to partial corrections of the atmospheric turbulence by the moao system . in all cases ,",
    "we find that the ee required to clearly identify the two components of the major merger considered in our simulations roughly corresponds the ee that provides us with a fwhm smaller than 2 pixels . for z=4 galaxies and using a 75mas pixel scale",
    ", this corresponds to an ee of @xmath025% in 150 mas , while this condition translates into 15% in 100 mas with a 50mas pixel@xmath7 scale . at z=1.6 , an ee of at least @xmath030% within 0.25 arcsec",
    "is required , using a 0.125 arcsec pixel@xmath7 scale .",
    "considering the spatial resolution only , ( i.e. , with an infinite snr ) , these specifications are indications of the minimum we will realistically require to recover spatially resolved kinematic information on distant galaxies .    considering the impact of signal to noise , if one wants to recover the full 2d kinematics of z=4 galaxies , at least 24 hr of integration time , and 34% of ee ( in 0.15 arcsec , using the 75 mas pixel@xmath7 scale ) are needed ( or 32% in 0.1 arcsec using the 50 mas pixel@xmath7 scale ) . for z=1.6 falcon simulations , at least 24 hr and 35% of ee in 0.25 arcsec",
    "are needed for recovering the full 2d kinematics in our simulations .",
    "when the snr provided by the moao system is large enough , these ee roughly corresponds to a pct smaller than 50% .",
    "this provides a good `` psf constrast '' at a given spatial scale , which avoids significant amount of polluting light from adjacent spectra .    at lower snr ,",
    "the required ee naturally depends on the surface brightness of the faintest regions to be detected , as well as on the adopted pixel scale .",
    "the choice of the latter strongly depends on the scientific goal and the size of the features to be recovered by 3d spectroscopy : a good `` scale - coupling '' between them must provide a least a few spatial element of resolutions per important scale . because the dynamical state of galaxies is mostly reflected in their large - scale motions , this means that only a few spatial element of resolution are needed per galaxy diameter : we performed additional simulations ( not shown here ) using another rotating disk with a less steep rotation curve ( ugc6778 , see @xcite ) , and found no quantitative difference in our results using this other rotating disk .",
    "although based on a limited number of simulations , we find that indeed a spatial resolution element of 150 mas ( pixel size of 75 mas ) seems to be a good choice for recovering large scale motions , providing relatively large snr with a `` scale - coupling '' @xmath05.3 element of resolution per galaxy diameter ( 0.8 arcsec ) . at the 50mas pixel@xmath7 scale ,",
    "a 42 m elt will typically need 8 hr of exposure time to reach a snr of at least 5 over a galaxy .",
    "such a snr allows us to use the diagnostic diagram as a useful tool to recover the dynamical nature of rotating disks and major mergers . because of the much smaller collecting area of the vlt , this exercise is limited to 8 hr with at least 35% of ee in 0.25 arcsec , for z=1.6 galaxies . in this case , the `` coupling factor '' is 4 .",
    "these results are consistent with previous studies at lower redshift ( z@xmath00.6 ) , where the dynamical nature of galaxies have been recovered using giraffe , with only 3 or so resolution elements ( at 0.52 arcsec pixel@xmath7 ) across each galaxy .",
    "we have developed software capable of end - to - end simulations of integral field spectrograph fed by an moao system . we have used this software to investigate a limited number of simulations in h - band , in order to give insights into how such moao - fed systems should perform on the vlt and the e - elt . by requiring that the instrument is able to distinguish between a rotating disk and a major merger",
    ", we were able to constrain the required ensquared energy to be able to recover their large - scale motions .",
    "separating the progenitors of the major merger requires only modest ee ( 15 - 26% at z=4 in a sample of 100 - 150mas ; 30% at z=1.6 in 0.25 arcsec ) , but long exposure times ( @xmath024hr ) .",
    "higher ees are generally needed to recover the full 2d kinematics in our simulations , typically 35% .",
    "provided that the total snr is large enough over the galaxy ( typically @xmath0 5 ) , it is possible to use more sophisticated methods , such as the diagnostic diagram introduced here , to distinguish between both types of objects , even at relatively low integration time for such distant objects ( 8 hrs ) . to generalize these results beyond what we described here , we have related these specifications to the concept of `` psf contrast '' , which is the amount of polluting light from adjacent spectra and which drives the minimal ee at a given spatial scale .",
    "the choice of the latter is driven mostly by the `` scale - coupling '' which is the relative size of the ifu pixel and the size of the features that the observe wishes to recovered in the data cube .",
    "distinguishing between a major merger and a disk , for example , can be largely done by investigating the large scale motions within a system , and a relatively coarse spatial resolution appears then to be sufficient .",
    "given this situation , a pixel scale of 50 - 75 mas seems to be a relatively good choice , since it provides sufficient snr in less time than a finer sampling and also has the advantage of relaxing the moao system requirements .",
    "more stringent requirements can be set by attempting to resolve and investigate structure in high redshift galaxies and that will be simulated in subsequent papers .",
