    "since 1948 , when casimir introduced the energy that got his name @xcite , calculation formulas have been looked for .",
    "many analytical and numerical methods have been proposed , such as the zeta function technique , the heat kernel method , semiclassical methods or green function ( local ) methods just to mention a few of them @xcite .",
    "however , exact results have been obtained only for some simple geometries . in this context ,",
    "several approximations have been proposed such as the proximity force approximation or psa , to cite two of them .",
    "more recently , a novel multiscattering formalism of casimir effect for the electromagnetic ( em ) field have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "it had been successfully used in calculations of casimir effect in new geometries , but has also been applied to obtain a generalization of psa to dielectrics with magnetic response in @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , this multiscattering formalism was applied to obtain a generalization of earnshaw s theorem to casimir effect , claiming on the impossibility of equilibrium states in systems governed by casimir physics  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it has been suggested that ti could lead to the appearance of equilibrium systems because casimir effect in @xcite .",
    "our goal is the generalization of psa to obtain the casimir energy between dielectrics with magnetoelectric response .",
    "to do so , we use the generalized constitutive relations of materials with magnetoelectric coupling to obtain a potential , which is the tree level of the born series of the required @xmath0 matrix .",
    "we will apply this formalism to the casimir energy between ti , as a result , we obtain a prelora of different behavior of the system depending on the electromagnetic response of the ti .",
    "atraction for all distances , repulsion for all distances , or also the existence of a stable equilibrium distance are obtainable in this system at zero and finite temperature .",
    "then we find a system where the recent extension of earnshaw s theorem of inexistence of stability on systems governed by casimir physics  @xcite is not applicable ( magnetoelectric coupling were not considered in  @xcite ) , therefore stable positions are not forbidden in the system studied here .",
    "in addition to that , we also propose a system candidate to perform quantum levitation in vacuum .",
    "other examples of repulsion within casimir systems have been proposed for very specific geometries in vacuum  @xcite , for systems immersed in fluids with dielectric properties different of vacuum  @xcite , or for the casimir interaction between dielectrics and metamaterials  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we extend the results for ti for arbitrary geometry in the psa , valid only in the diluted limit .",
    "it is , when the dielectric constant @xmath1 and the diamagnetic constant @xmath2 for any @xmath3 body of the system .",
    "the article is structured as follows : using the generalized constitutive relations of materials with magnetoelectric coupling and the formalism presented in  @xcite , in sect .",
    "[ sec : 2 ] we will obtain the psa of casimir energy for the zero and high temperature limits starting from the exact casimir energy formula given in @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sec : 3 ] we will apply the formalism developed in sect . [",
    "sec : 2 ] to obtain the psa casimir energy for ti in the zero and high temperature limits .",
    "we will obtain conditions to the appearance of atraction , repulsion and the appearance of equilibrium distances in term of the response of the ti to the em field . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec : 4 ] we will perform a numerical study of the psa casimir energy between two ti parallel plates to compare the results of psa with exact results already done in  @xcite , to study the validity of the approximations made .",
    "we also will obtain numerical results of the psa casimir energy for the sphere - plate system , because its experimental relevance  @xcite .",
    "our goal is the calculation of the complete electromagnetic casimir energy between two bodies in the soft dielectric limit with magnetoelectric response . for this purpose , we use the multiscattering approach to em casimir effect @xcite to obtain the casimir energy between two compact bodies at a given temperature @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the identity matrix , @xmath7 are the matsubara frequencies and @xmath8 is the thermal wavelength .",
    "the prime indicates that the zero matsubara frequency contribution has height of @xmath9 .",
    "all the information regarding the system is described by the @xmath10 matrix . for a system of two objects ,",
    "this matrix is @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the t scattering matrix of the _ _",
    "i__th object , which accounts for all the geometrical information and electromagnetic properties of the object .",
    "@xmath13 is the translation matrix of electromagnetic waves from object @xmath14 to object @xmath15 , which accounts for all information regarding the relative positions between the objects of the system . from eq .",
    ", the quantum ( @xmath16 ) and classical limits ( @xmath17 , equivalent to the high temperature limit ) are easily obtained as @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . to obtain the psa of casimir energy",
    ", we apply the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "then , using the relation @xmath20 and that @xmath21 , we write eq . as the asymptotic series @xmath22 in addition to that , we use the position representation of operators instead the multipole representation used in @xcite , so we can identify @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the matricial free dyadic green function given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 operator is related with the potential @xmath25 by the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "when @xmath25 is small , we can apply a born expansion to the lippmann - schwinger equation to obtain an approximation for the @xmath0 operator in the diluted limit as @xmath26 . here",
    "we remind that the use of a born approximation as a result of the lippmann - schwinger equation is more valid for lower potentials . in our case",
    "this means that psa will be valid in the diluted limit , and we will need high order corrections when this diluted limit does not be longer applicable .",
    "to define the potential @xmath27 , we use the generalized constitutive relations of materials with magnetoelectric coupling @xmath28 where @xmath3 and @xmath29 are the magnetoelectric couplings .",
    "the potential of each body can be defined as the difference of energy of the em field because the existence of this body .",
    "having into account that the energy of the em field is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 in the vacuum , the em energy in presence of @xmath33 generalized dielectrics is @xmath34 we use the generalized constitutive relations given in eq . to obtain the excess of energy",
    "because the existence of each dielectric as @xmath35 then the potential is defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the characteristic function of the @xmath14 body volume ( 1 inside the body and 0 in the rest of the space ) .",
    "the generalization to space dependent dielectric constants is straightforward .",
    "now we study the lowest expansion order in dielectric quantities of the casimir energy . in the lowest expansion order ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 in eq . ) , we get the asymptotic approximation of the casimir energy between two bodies as @xmath42 where all operators depends on @xmath43 . these operators are defined over three different linear spaces @xcite : ( 1 ) an @xmath44 space , whose components are the electric and the magnetic field ; ( 2 ) over the space coordinates , because we are working with a vector and a pseudovector ; and ( 3 ) over positions .",
    "we must solve the trace over these three spaces : eh space , vector coordinate space , and position space and sum over the matsubara frequencies to obtain the psa energy .",
    "as a first application , we use the potential @xmath27 given in eq . to obtain the psa casimir energy of frequency independent dielectric with magnetoelectric couplings at zero temperature as @xmath45 where @xmath46 this result generalizes the feinberg and sucher potential  @xcite to objects with magnetoelectric couplings , but only in the diluted limit . in the high temperature limit",
    ", the psa of casimir energy is @xmath47 where @xmath48    it is a straightforward calculation obtain the psa at any finite temperature .",
    "the result is similar to the finite temperature results of psa for diluted dielectrics shown in  @xcite .    as we can see , if magnetoelectric couplings have different signs and are strong enough to compensate the usual electric and magnetic coupling of dielectrics , a repulsive casimir energy between objects can be achieved in the diluted limit .",
    "recently , in @xcite , a. grushin and a. cortijo demonstrated the existence of an equilibrium distance between topological insulators with opposite topological polarizabilities sign between parallel plates .",
    "this result was extended for all temperatures in @xcite , leading to a reduction of the equilibrium distance with the temperature until the disappearance of the equilibrium distance in the high temperature regime .",
    "regions of casimir repulsion for all distances were also reported for some values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in this part of the article",
    ", we apply the formalism developed in the previous section to ti .",
    "the constitutive relations of ti are @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in order to apply the formalism developed in the last section ,",
    "we need the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 as a function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then @xmath57 where @xmath3 is the fine structure constant ( @xmath58 ) following the discussion in @xcite , we assume @xmath59 and @xmath60 is quantized in odd integer values of @xmath61 such that @xmath62 where @xmath63 , determined by the nature of the magnetic coating , but independent of the absolute value of the magnetization of the coating . positive or negative values of @xmath60 are related to different signs of the magnetization on the surface @xcite , which we consider is perpendicular to the surface of the body .",
    "being a topological contribution , @xmath60 is defined in the bulk as a constant whenever the bulk brillouin zone is defined @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , we assume that the frequency dependent dielectric function @xmath64 is described by an oscillator model of the form : @xmath65 because there are few experimental results of @xmath66 for ti , we will assume that there is just one resonance .",
    "the case of multiple resonances or another model of @xmath66 can be easily generalized  @xcite .    because the frequency dependence of @xmath66 for ti , it is not possible to obtain the integrand of the psa energy at zero temperature in a closed form in terms of simple functions .",
    "then the psa casimir energy at zero temperature for topological insulators is given by the integral @xmath67 where @xmath68 now depends on the distance between points of the ti and on the dielectric properties of both ti as @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath49 , @xmath71 is the dimensionless distance and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are functions which depends on a linear combination of different meijer @xmath74 functions too long to be written here .",
