    "in the manuscript , we show the possibility to enhance a 2-photon fluorescence process as the output pulse is temporally compressed . in this section ,",
    "we compare the enhancement of both linear ( at @xmath5 = 800 nm ) and the 2-photon signal ( at @xmath52 400 - 600 nm ) in the case of spatial but temporally broadened ( spatial only , monochromatic in the manuscript ) focusing and spatio - temporal focusing .      * in the monochromatic spatial only focusing process , we use n degrees of freedom , the n independent slm segments controlled , to focus a speckle pattern at a specific wavelength @xmath9 within a set of @xmath4 wavelengths . for this specific wavelength @xmath9 , the signal - to - background ratio is then approximately on the order of n. the other @xmath4 - 1 speckles are summing incoherently and they simply contribute to increase the level of the background by approximately @xmath4 . at the end , the signal - to - background ratio observed on the linear image is on the order of n/@xmath4 .",
    "* in the spatio - temporal focusing focusing process , we use the same n degrees of freedom to focus the output pulse both spatially and temporally . from a spectral point of view , this is equivalent to focus spatially each of the individual @xmath4 monochromatic speckles created at the @xmath4 different wavelengths . in average ,",
    "each speckle is then spatially focused by using n/@xmath4 degrees of freedom .",
    "this gives a signal - to - background ratio on the order of n/@xmath4 in each speckle .",
    "finally , the incoherent sum of these speckles generates a linear image with the same signal - to - background ratio n/@xmath4 .",
    "the reasoning is identical for a polychromatic focusing , as it is independent of the imposed spectral phase relation @xmath51 .    in the linear images presented on fig .  3 of the manuscript , and on the inset of fig .",
    "[ linear ] of this supplementary material , the signal - to - background ratios for both the spatial only focusing and the spatio - temporal focusing are respectively equal to 42 and 45 .",

    "while the increase in snr of the two - photon signal is an unequivocal sign of temporal recompression , one can see that the value of the snr is still far from the theoretical value for a quadratic process .",
    "this can be attributed to the two - photon screen finite thickness ( 20 @xmath53 ) , which means that the camera records the two photon fluorescence corresponding to several speckle grain planes at the same time in our setup , therefore increasing the background and also enlarging the apparent two - photon focus size .",
    "+ besides , the size of the linear focusing spot at the output is diffraction - limited . in our case , the spot size in both the spatial only or the spatio - temporal focusing configurations are the same because of the narrow relative spectral bandwidth .",

    "a similar approach with the 2-photon fluorescence signals leads to an identical 2-photon focusing spot size in the case of a spatial or a spatio - temporal focusing .    in fig .",
    "[ linear ] and fig .",

    "<S> our setup allows us to access both the spatial and spectral phase information of the mstm , thus using the multiply scattering medium in conjunction with the slm as a lens and a pulse shaper . </S>",
    "<S> it is also conceivable to focus two pulses at two different times at two different spatial positions , or to control the duration of the pulse by adding a quadratic phase relation between the frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> as these examples indicates , any temporal shape is achievable , with a resolution given by the temporal duration of the pulse , over a temporal interval related to the confinement time of the medium and limited spatially by the speckle grain size . </S>",
    "<S> it can be achieved using only spatial degrees of freedom of a single slm . </S>",
    "<S> this temporal control could enable coherent quantum control  @xcite , or the excitation of localized nano - objects , and open interesting perspectives for the study of light - matter interaction , non - linear imaging in multiply scattering media , and more fundamental insights such as light transport properties  @xcite .    </S>",
