    "what is the cosmological constant ? how can be computed ? these are some of the many puzzling questions which are still unsolved .",
    "basically the cosmological constant can be connected to the energy of the vacuum .",
    "however , the absence of a complete quantum gravitational theory increases the number of questions instead of giving answers .",
    "general relativity ( gr ) is the best theory explaining the behavior of the gravitational field including also the cosmological constant .",
    "however gr fails to describe the gravitational field in the quantum range . despite of this problem ,",
    "in gr there exists a quantization procedure known as the wheeler - de witt equation ( wdw)@xcite which encodes some aspects of the quantum properties of the gravitational field included the cosmological constant .",
    "we say some , because a complete solution of the wdw equation does not exist and one needs to reduce the degree of the difficulty by fixing a background and freezing some degrees of freedom .",
    "the wdw equation is the quantum version of the classical hamiltonian constraint representing the invariance under time reparametrization .",
    "its derivation is a consequence of the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decomposition @xcite of space time based on the following line element@xmath1 where @xmath2 is the lapse function and @xmath3 the shift function . in terms of the adm variables , the four dimensional scalar curvature @xmath4 can be decomposed in the following way@xmath5 where@xmath6\\ ] ] is the second fundamental form , @xmath7 @xmath8 is its trace , @xmath4 is the three dimensional scalar curvature and @xmath9 is the three dimensional determinant of the metric .",
    "the last term in @xmath10 represents the boundary terms contribution where the four - velocity @xmath11 is the timelike unit vector normal to the spacelike hypersurfaces ( @xmath12=constant ) denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the acceleration of the timelike normal @xmath11 .",
    "thus@xmath15   = \\sqrt{-\\text{\\/\\thinspace \\thinspace}^{4}\\text{\\/{}\\negthinspace}g}\\left (   \\mathcal{r}-2\\lambda\\right ) = \\frac{n}{2\\kappa}\\sqrt{g}\\text { } \\left [   k_{ij}k^{ij}-k^{2}+\\,r-2\\lambda -2\\nabla_{\\mu}\\left (   ku^{\\mu}+a^{\\mu}\\right )   \\right ]   \\label{lag}%\\ ] ] represents the gravitational lagrangian density where @xmath16 with @xmath17 the newton s constant and for the sake of generality we have also included a cosmological constant @xmath18 . after a legendre transformation , the wdw equation simply becomes@xmath19 \\psi=0,\\label{wdwo}%\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the super - metric and where the conjugate super - momentum @xmath21 is defined as@xmath22 note that @xmath23 , represents the classical constraint which guarantees the invariance under time reparametrization .",
    "the other classical constraint represents the invariance by spatial diffeomorphism and it is described by @xmath24 , where the vertical stroke @xmath25  denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the @xmath26 metric @xmath27 .",
    "solving eq.@xmath28 allows to extract information on the early universe and on the cosmological constant .",
    "of course , the form of the solution is depending on the background one considers . in this paper , we fix our attention on the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric without matter fields . to the reader , this choice could seem a restriction , however one has to think that in the very early universe , before the inflationary phase , it is likely that all the quantum information can be carried on by the gravitational field , because of its non - linear nature .",
    "however , even in this simplified vision many problems arise , especially for the inflationary epoch . in recent years , the idea of modifying gr to cure some of its diseases has been considered . from one side , the so - called @xmath29 theories have been taken under examination to cure some problems in the infrared ( ir ) region@xcite and on the other hand modifications on short scales allowing a power - counting ultraviolet ( uv ) renormalizable have been proposed by hoava motivated by the lifshitz theory in solid state physics@xcite@xcite .",
    "this theory is dubbed as hoava - lifshitz ( hl ) theory and should recover general relativity in the ir limit .",
    "nevertheless the price to pay to obtain a renormalizable theory in the hl  proposal is that we have no general covariance or , in other words lorentz symmetry is broken .",
    "another proposal which distorts gravity in the uv is gravity s rainbow@xcite .",
    "gravity s rainbow has some appealing features to explain inflation@xcite . in a series of papers ,",
    "one of us used gravity s rainbow to cure some divergences appearing in zero point energy ( zpe ) calculations , at least to one loop@xcite .",
    "the final zpe result has been interpreted as an induced cosmological constant obtained as an eigenvalue of an appropriate sturm - liouville problem .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same idea has been applied in a hl theory@xcite in a flrw background ,",
    "the final result is that non trivial eigenvalues have been found depending on the parameters of the theory .",
    "note that in gr , as we will show extensively in the next section , the cosmological constant can not be considered as an eigenvalue of any sturm - liouville problem for the flrw background in a mini - superspace approximation without matter fields .",
    "it appears therefore , that distortions of gr allow new results that otherwise should not be possible .",
    "it remains to consider another distortion connected with the previous ones : a varying speed of light ( vsl ) theory@xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one allows the speed of light to change in some specified way , in an attempt to solve the major cosmological issues of modern theoretical physics .",
    "it is well known , that one of the major features of einstein s theory of relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is always at constant rate .",
    "however , the cosmological problems that led to the theoretical introduction of dark matter and dark energy into modern cosmology have motivated some physicists to look for solutions in other directions , included the variation of the speed of light . in vsl , it is supposed that light travels faster in the early periods of the existence of the universe and for this reason , it could solve problems related to the inflationary phase ( flatness , horizon , homogeneity , etc. ",
    "of course , this hypothesis breaks the lorentz invariance .",
    "the vsl model has been embedded within the general framework of the time varying fine structure constant theory and reformulated as a dielectric vacuum theory @xcite . moreover",
    ", isotropy and homogeneity problems may find their appropriate solutions through this mechanism @xcite .",
    "recently quantum cosmological aspect of vsl models have been studied to see if the tunneling from nothing@xcite  and the hartle - hawking no - boundary proposal@xcite  can be better approached in this context@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to repeat the calculation of ref.@xcite in a vsl context to see if there are non trivial eigenvalues of an appropriate sturm - liouville problem , which will be interpreted as a cosmological constant induced by quantum fluctuations of the scale factor .",
