    "in spite of many efforts , only a limited understanding has been achieved regarding the emergence of collective order in non - equilibrium systems . while these systems often present features analogous to the those found in equilibrium , such as phase - transitions and long - range correlations , it is not clear how to use the powerful tools available in equilibrium statistical mechanics to analyze their properties . to overcome this problem",
    ", it may be useful to consider cases where simple qualitative characteristics ( e.g. the existence and order of a phase transition ) are common to different non - equilibrium systems with similar properties .",
    "a class of non - equilibrium systems that has sparked increasing interest in recent years is given by models of groups of swarming agents @xcite .",
    "these are used to describe the collective behavior of self - propelled agents such as schools of fish , flocks of birds , or herds of quadrupeds @xcite .",
    "even the simplest of these models displays large - scale organized structures , in which agents separated by distances much larger than their interaction ranges can coordinate and swarm in the same direction .",
    "if noise is added to the system , this ordered state is destroyed as the noise level increases .",
    "when the noise reaches a critical value , the system undergoes a phase transition to a disordered state where agents move in random directions @xcite .",
    "this phase transition has been quite thoroughly analyzed through numerical simulations .",
    "however , the lack of a systematic theoretical approach to non - equilibrium systems has hindered a proper characterization of the order - disorder phase transition , and there are still doubts about its basic features even in this simplest of cases @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are particularly interested in how this phase transition might be affected by the way in which the noise is introduced in the system .",
    "two different types of noise , which we will call _ extrinsic _ and _ intrinsic _ , have recently been considered in models of swarming @xcite . in these models , at every time step each particle receives a signal from its neighbors that tells the particle in which direction to move next .",
    "the extrinsic noise consists in that the signal received by the particle is blurred ( because , say , the environment is not completely transparent and the particle can not see its neighbors very well ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the particle may move in a different direction to the one dictated by the neighbors .",
    "in contrast , in the intrinsic noise case each particle receives the signal sent by the neighbors perfectly , but then it may `` decide '' to do something else and move in a different direction .",
    "thus , the extrinsic noise can be thought of as produced by a blurry environment , whereas the intrinsic noise comes from the `` free will '' of the particles , so to speak ; namely , from the uncertainty in the particle s decision mechanism . in either case , of course , the net result is that , at every time step , the particle may move in a direction that departs from the one dictated by the neighbors .",
    "it has been pointed out that these two distinct types of noise , extrinsic and intrinsic , can produce very different order - disorder phase transitions @xcite .",
    "this can been shown analytically using a network approach in which the elements , instead of interacting with the neighbors in a physical space , interact with any element that is linked to them through a network connection .",
    "this kind of description has been used to model a large range of dynamics , such as the traffic between internet websites or servers , the evolution of an epidemic outbreak , the mechanisms triggered by gene expressions in the cell , or the activity of the brain @xcite . in the context of swarming systems , the network approach is equivalent to a mean - field theory in which correlations between the particles are not taken into account . however , this approach has the virtue that it allows us to separate clearly the dynamical interaction rule that determines the dynamical state of the particles , from the topology of the underlying network that develops in time and space and dictates who interacts with who .",
    "therefore , under the network approach it is possible to focus on the effects that the two different types of noise have on the dynamics of the system .",
    "even when the network approach leaves aside some important aspects of the dynamics of swarming systems ( such as correlations in space and time ) , some appealing analogies can be established between the swarming and network systems .",
    "indeed , in the simplest swarming models , the dynamics is defined by giving to each agent a steering rule that uses the velocities of all agents in its vicinity as an input to compute its own velocity for the next time - step .",
    "this algorithm can be associated to a dynamics on a switching network that links at every time - step all agents that are within the interaction range of each other . in this context , the network is simply a representation of the spatial dynamics of the system .",
    "however , it has been shown that this analogy can be pushed further successfully and that a static network with long - range connections can capture some of the main qualitative behaviors of simple swarming models @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we compare the properties of the phase transitions and dynamical mappings of two kinds of network models to further explore the analogies described above .",
    "we consider models that incorporate three of the main aspects of the interaction between the particles in swarms : an average input signal from the neighbors , noise , and , in some sense , extremely long - range interactions . in the first kind of model the elements of the network can acquire only two states , + 1 and -1 ; whereas in the second , the elements are represented by 2d vectors whose angles take any value between 0 and @xmath0 .",
    "we find that swarming systems and their network counterparts indeed present qualitatively similar behaviors depending on whether the noise is intrinsic or extrinsic .",
    "we also determine numerically that the same qualitative features arise when the particles are placed on a small - world network , and we extend our results to the case in which the network models are subject to both types of noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vicsek ] we present the model introduced by vicsek and his group to describe the emergence of order in swarming systems . in particular , we focus our attention on how the phase transition seems to change when the noise changes from intrinsic to extrinsic . in section  [ sec : voter ] we present a majority voter model on a network , which is reminiscent of the ising model with discrete internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this model is simple enough as to be treated analytically , at least for the case of homogeneous random network topologies for which we show analytically that the two types of noise indeed produce two different types of phase transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vectorial ] we introduce another network model in which the internal degrees of freedom are continuous ( 2d vectors ) .",
    "this model can be treated analytically in the limit of infinite network connectivity . however , these results and extensive numerical simulations clearly indicate that the two types of noise again produce two different phase transitions , which are analogous to the ones observed in the majority voter model and in the self - propelled model . in sec .  [",
    "sec : mean - field ] we discuss the mean - field assumptions conveyed in the two network models and how they relate to the self - propelled model .",
    "we also show that the nature of the phase transition produced by each type of noise does not change when the small - world topology is implemented , which produces strong spatial correlations between the network elements .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results .",
    "arguably , the simplest model to describe the collective motion of a group of organisms was proposed by vicsek and his collaborators @xcite . in this model ,",
    "@xmath1 particles move within a 2d box of sides @xmath2 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the particles are characterized by their positions , @xmath3 , and their velocities @xmath4 , ( represented here as complex numbers ) .",
    "all the particles move with the same speed @xmath5 . however , the direction of motion @xmath6 of each particle changes in time according to a rule that captures in a qualitative way the interactions between organisms in a flock .",
    "the basic idea is that each particle moves in the average direction of motion of the particles surrounding it , _ plus some noise_. two interaction rules have been considered in the literature , which differ in the way the noise is introduced into the system . to state these rules mathematically , we need some definitions .",
    "let @xmath7 be the circular vicinity of radius @xmath8 centered at @xmath9 , and @xmath10 be the number of particles whose positions are within @xmath7 at time @xmath11 .",
    "we will denote as @xmath12 the average velocity of the particles which at time @xmath11 are within the vicinity @xmath7 , namely @xmath13 for reasons that will be clear later , we will call @xmath12 _ the input signal _ received by the @xmath14-th particle @xmath15 . with the above definitions , the interaction rule originally proposed by vicsek _",

    "the `` angle '' function is defined in such a way that if @xmath21 , then angle@xmath22 = \\theta$ ] .",
    "note that in this case the direction of the neighbors average velocity @xmath12 ( the input signal ) is computed first and then the noise is added to this direction .",
    "we will refer to the interaction rule given in eqs .   as the _ self - propelled model with intrinsic noise _",
    "( spmin ) , and to the term @xmath23 as the _ intrinsic noise_.    the second interaction rule , proposed by grgoire and chat in ref .",
    "@xcite , is given by    [ eq : spmen ] @xmath24 , \\label{eq : chate}\\\\ \\vec{v}_n(t+\\delta t ) & = & ve^{i\\theta_n(t+\\delta t)},\\\\ \\vec{x}_n(t+\\delta t ) & = & \\vec{x}_n(t ) + \\vec{v}_n(t+\\delta t)\\delta t,\\label{eq : kinetic2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 and @xmath19 have the same meaning as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vicsek ] ) . in this case , a random vector of constant length @xmath19 and random orientation @xmath17 is added to the neighbors average velocity @xmath12 , and then the direction of the resultant vector is computed .",
    "we will refer to the model given in eqs .   as the _ self - propelled model with extrinsic noise _ ( spmen ) , and to the term @xmath25 as the _",
    "extrinsic noise_.    one might think that the two interaction rules ( [ eq : vicsek ] ) and ( [ eq : chate ] ) are more or less equivalent and should produce qualitatively similar dynamical behaviors .",
    "however , as mentioned in the introduction , there is a clear physical difference between these two ways of adding noise to the system . in the spmin",
    "the uncertainty induced by the noise is in the decision mechanism ( the angle function ) , but not in the input signal that each particle receives . in contrast , one could say that in the spmen the particles are `` short - sighted '' and do not see well the signal sent by the neighbors , which is what causes the uncertainty in this case .",
    "thus , one can not expect , _ a priori _ , the onset of collective order to be the same in both the spmin and the spmen , for the way in which the noise is introduced in both cases is clearly different , not only algorithmically , but also physically .    to measure the amount of order in the system we define the instantaneous value of the order parameter @xmath26 as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the average velocity of the entire system at time @xmath11 .",
    "thus , if @xmath29 the particles move in random uncorrelated directions , whereas if @xmath30 , all the particles are aligned and move in the same direction . in the limit @xmath31 , the order parameter @xmath26 reaches a constant value @xmath32 that characterizes the steady state behavior of the system . of the order parameter is computed as @xmath33 for large @xmath34 . ]    in their original work , vicsek and his group noted the existence of a phase transition from ordered states ( @xmath35 ) to disordered states ( @xmath29 ) as the value of the noise intensity @xmath19 increases .",
    "we illustrate this phase transition for the spmin in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevicsek](a ) , which was obtained numerically for a system with @xmath36 particles within a box of sides @xmath37",
    ". the interaction radius and particle speed used in the numerical simulation are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively . on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevicsek](b ) shows the phase transition for the spmen with exactly the same parameters as in the previous case . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasevicsek ] , the phase transition looks continuous ( second order ) for the spmin , whereas it is clearly discontinuous ( first order ) for the spmen .",
    "numerical simulations performed for larger systems than the one used in fig .  [ fig : phasevicsek ] also seem to indicate that the phase transition exhibited in the spmin is continuous @xcite . nonetheless , based on numerical simulations , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have pointed out that the phase transition may be discontinuous regardless of the type of noise , and that the apparent continuity of the phase transition in the spmin is due to strong finite - size effects .",
    "for some reason , these finite size effects are not so strong in the spmen , in which the phase transition is clearly discontinuous . due to a lack of a general mathematical formalism to analyze the self - propelled model , ( either with intrinsic or extrinsic noise ) , the way in which each type of noise affects the dynamics of the system remains unknown . in what follows we present two simplified versions of the vicsek model that can be solved analytically for the two types of noise .",
    "we show that in these simpler models , the phase transition is continuous for the intrinsic noise and discontinuous for the extrinsic noise .",
    "the first network model that we consider consists of a set of @xmath1 binary variables , @xmath40 , each acquiring the values + 1 or -1 .",
    "the value of each @xmath41 changes in time and is determined by a set of @xmath42 other elements , @xmath43 , which we will call the _ inputs _ of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , at every time step every element @xmath41 receives a signal from its set of inputs @xmath44 and updates its value according to that signal .",
    "different ways of assigning the inputs to each element lead to different network topologies . in this section we focus on the homogeneous random topology characterized by the following two properties :    * all the elements have the same number of inputs @xmath45 , namely , @xmath46 for all @xmath14 . * the @xmath45 inputs of each element are chosen randomly from anywhere in the system .",
    "note that this is a directed network , for if @xmath41 is an input to @xmath47 , then @xmath47 is not necessarily an input to @xmath41 .",
    "we can think of this system as a society of @xmath1 individuals in which every individual @xmath41 can have two opinions ( + 1 and -1 ) about an issue .",
    "each individual s opinion is influenced by its @xmath45 friends ( inputs ) , who are randomly chosen among the @xmath1 individuals in the society .",
    "generally , each individual will tend to be of the same opinion as the majority of its friends , but with a given probability it can have the opposite opinion .",
    "this probability of having an opinion opposite to that of the majority can be considered as a `` temperature '' that introduces noise in the dynamics of the system .",
    "here we consider two ways of introducing this noise , which are analogous to the intrinsic and extrinsic noise in the self - propelled model .",

    "however , the nature of this phase transition ( i.e. whether continuous or discontinuous ) depends on the type of noise . to see that this is indeed the case ,",

    "note that the nature of phase transition , i.e. whether continuous or discontinuous , does not change with the rewiring probability @xmath187 .",
    "what changes is the critical value of the noise at which the phase transition occurs , but the continuity of the phase transition does not change with @xmath187 .",
    "this is important because for small values of @xmath187 there are strong spatial correlations in the system generated by the first - neighbor interactions in the small - world network .",
    "however , even in the presence of such spatial correlations , the phase transition appears to be discontinuous for the extrinsic noise and continuous for the intrinsic noise .",
    "one advantage of the vnm is that the finite - size effects are much smaller than in the self - propelled model .",
    "therefore , the continuous or discontinuous character of the phase transiion can be very well observed with @xmath36 particles .",
    "although the self - propelled model proposed by vicsek et . al . is one of the simplest models that we have to describe the emergence of collective order in groups of organisms , its analytic solution has remained elusive for more than a decade . due to this lack of an analytical formalism to analyze the dynamical properties of the self - propelled model , it has not been possible to properly characterize some of its most basic features . in this work",
    "we have been particularly interested in how the way in which the noise is introduced in the system affects the nature of the phase transition . in the self - propelled model ,",
    "numerical simulations indicate that the intrinsic noise originally proposed by vicsek and his group seems to produce a continuous phase transition .",
    "in contrast , the extrinsic noise later introduced by grgoire and chat generates a phase transition that is clearly discontinuous .    to determine the effect that each type of noise has on the phase transition , we have presented two network models that capture the main characteristics of the interactions in the self - propelled model and that can be handled analytically .",
    "these two network models , which we call the majority voter model and the vectorial network model , can be considered as the mean - field representation of the self - propelled model in 1 and 2 dimensions .",
    "in fact , we have shown numerically that the self - propelled model with random mixing , which is obtained in the limit of large particle speeds , is fully equivalent to the vectorial network model .",
    "when the number of interactions per particle is finite , our numeric and analytic results for the two network models show that , in the absence of extrinsic noise , the phase transition driven by the intrinsic noise is continuous , in accordance with the results obtained for the original vicsek model ( spmin ) . in the opposite case , namely when there is no intrinsic noise and only the extrinsic noise is present , the phase transition is discontinuous , which is consistent with the behavior reported by grgoire and chat for the spmen .",
    "the above results are true even for the small - world topology in which there exist strong spatial correlations induced by the first - neighbor connections .    for intermediate cases in which both types of noise are present , and for finite network connectivities ,",
    "the situation is more complicated : the voter model exhibits a phase transition that is always continuous , whereas for the vectorial model there is a region in the noise - parameter space where the phase transition is continuous , and another region where it is discontinuous . in this later case",
    ", the region of discontinuity grows as the network connectivity increases .",
    "interestingly , in the limit of infinite network connectivities and in the presence of both types of noise , the phase transition is always discontinuous in both the voter model and the vectorial model .",
    "an interesting open question that follows from our work is to what extent can the stationary collective features of the network systems agree quantitatively with those of the corresponding swarming models .",
    "it has been suggested that the coupling between global order and local density could make the phase transition in the self - propelled model discontinuous regardless of the type of noise @xcite .",
    "however , it is not clear how such coupling intervenes in the onset of collective order in the self - propelled model , nor how it can change the phase transition from continuous to discontinuous . to explore this idea , and more importantly , to determine whether or not the results obtained for the network models presented here can be applied to the self - propelled model , further analysis of the relation between the dynamics of a swarming system and the connectivity of its corresponding network representation is required .",
