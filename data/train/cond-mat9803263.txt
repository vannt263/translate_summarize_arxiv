    "understanding the subtle interactions between macromolecules , such as polymer or proteins , and amphiphiles , such as surfactants or phospholipids , has been a problem of prime interest in recent years in many industrial applications and in biological systems .",
    "for instance , biomembranes @xcite are usually depicted as fluid bilayers composed of different constituents : phospholipids , cholesterol and proteins .",
    "in addition , a complex macromolecular network ( _ the cytoskeleton _ ) is associated with the inner side of the bilayer and modifies the mechanical properties of the membrane , while the glycocalix , on the outer side , is believed to play an important role in molecular recognition . in industry , surfactants are used in a wide range of applications ( detergents , soaps , oil recovery , paints ) , where polymers are often added in order to provide stability for the system , especially in the case of colloidal suspensions and oil / water emulsions @xcite .",
    "those mixed polymer and surfactant systems tend to create complex self - assembly structures ( connected micelles , gels , networks , etc . )",
    "finally , drug delivery via micro - encapsulation is an other example where the stability of surfactant vesicles is improved by the adsorption of polymer @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", a new category of _ associating _ polymers has been introduced .",
    "those are the hydrophobically modified water soluble polymers ( hm - wsp ) , consisting of a water soluble polymer backbone carrying small hydrophobic side chains .",
    "such polymers present interesting properties of self - association , which may even be enhanced by the addition of surfactant , and are very useful as viscosity modifiers of aqueous solutions @xcite .",
    "the subtle coupling between the surfactant and the polymer may lead to unusual phenomena like thermogelation @xcite , where gelation of the system is obtained upon increasing of the temperature .",
    "such systems have been studied theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally in the bulk . however ,",
    "little is known about their behavior at interfaces @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "the interaction of water soluble polymers with a surfactant monolayer located at the air / water interface is considered .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the relatively simple situation of an insoluble surfactant monomolecular layer ( _ langmuir monolayer _ ) .",
    "langmuir monolayers have been used in many applications @xcite , from evaporation control to non - linear optic devices ( via the creation of _ langmuir - blodgett monolayers _ ) .",
    "they are also used to study crystallization of solids @xcite and provide useful model systems for more complicated fluctuating liquid interfaces ( membranes ) where curvature effects can not be neglected .",
    "another motivation for the present study comes from the lack of understanding of adsorption ( or depletion ) of polymers close to non - ideal interfaces , as compared with adsorption on ideal surfaces ( namely , perfectly flat and chemically homogeneous ) . on ideal surfaces @xcite@xcite theories for neutral and flexible polymers in good solvent",
    "have been performed ( both for adsorption and depletion ) and compared with scaling theories . for non - ideal surfaces ,",
    "much less theoretical works exists .",
    "it has been suggested that the bending properties of a curved interface are modified when in presence of adsorbing polymer @xcite@xcite .",
    "when the polymer adsorbs on both sides of the interface ( a bilayer for instance ) , the curvature modulus decreases , while the saddle - splay modulus increases .",
    "when it adsorbs only on one side , a non - zero spontaneous curvature is induced .",
    "the situation of a perfectly flat but chemically heterogeneous interface has been considered only in a few works @xcite@xcite .",
    "the case of annealed disorder ( namely , when the disorder is at thermodynamic equilibrium and the heterogeneities can diffuse laterally ) is found to behave differently from the case of quenched disorder ( where heterogeneities are spatially  frozen \" ) .",
    "however , in both cases the adsorption of the polymer is increased by the non - ideality of the surface . in this context",
    ", a surfactant monolayer is an example of a non - ideal annealed surface , where the order parameter is the local surface surfactant concentration .",
    "the phase diagram of surfactant monolayers can be constructed as a function of the thermodynamical variables @xcite : surface pressure and temperature ( or equivalently area per molecule and temperature ) . at low surface pressure ,",
    "a phase separation occurs ( for temperatures below the corresponding critical temperature ) .",
    "dilute ( gaseous ) and dense ( liquid - expanded ) regions of the monolayer coexist , in analogy to phase transitions in the bulk . in the phase diagram , single - phase and two - phase regions",
    "are separated by a coexistence curve . at higher surface pressure ,",
    "other phase transitions occur . depending on the symmetries of the specific surfactant molecules , the phase diagrams are more complex and still a topic of current investigation @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we consider how a simple condensation transition ( gas to liquid expanded ) of a surfactant monolayer at the air / water interface is affected by the presence of polymer in the water subphase . the free energy and the assumptions used in deriving it are introduced in sec .",
    "2 , while in sec .",
    "3 we discuss the main results , as applied to a simple case ; the general theory is detailed in appendices a and b. finally , some analytical considerations on the critical point are presented in appendix c.",
    "the model used for the mixed surfactant / polymer system follows closely the lattice model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . the local ( dimensionless )",
    "free energy per site @xmath1 , rescaled in units of @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath4 is the temperature , can be separated into three parts : the surfactant contribution @xmath5 , the polymer contribution @xmath6 , and the coupling term @xmath7 : @xmath8 in the following , those three terms are discussed separately .",
    "the monolayer free energy is calculated using a lattice - gas model .",
    "each lattice site is occupied either by a surfactant molecule or by an artificial vacancy , in order to allow us to consider a compressible monolayer .",
    "the free energy of a surfactant monolayer is the sum of the enthalpy and entropy of mixing and depends on the monolayer area fraction ( or equivalently coverage ) @xmath9 ranging from zero to one , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the close - packing area of a surfactant molecule ( or the area of one site on the lattice ) and @xmath12 is the actual area per surfactant molecule on the interface .",
    "@xmath14 for a surfactant molecule @xcite .",
    "disregarding linear terms , the surfactant free energy @xmath5 ( per site and per @xmath15 ) , within a bragg - williams ( mean field ) theory , is written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the dimensionless interaction parameter of the surfactant on the surface and describes van der waals interactions between neighboring particles .",
    "the interactions between the head groups of the surfactant molecules , playing an important role in the determination of the highly compressed phases , as well as the freedom of conformation for the hydrophobic chains , whose coupling with the surfactant average @xmath9 is determinant in the liquid expanded versus liquid condensed transition @xcite , are not taken into account .",
    "as only short - ranged interactions are considered ( between neighboring sites ) , the surfactant molecules are supposed to be neutral .",
    "the main interaction modeled by the parameter @xmath18 are the van der waals interactions .    for an insoluble monolayer ,",
    "the total number of surfactant molecules is fixed . at low ( and positive ) values of @xmath18 ( corresponding to low temperatures ) ,",
    "a phase separation between dense and dilute regions follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfactant ] ) .",
    "the stability of such a monolayer is obtained by studying the convexity of the free energy  @xcite .",
    "the monolayer becomes unstable if the second derivative of the free energy becomes negative .",
    "the condition @xmath19 defines the _ spinodal line _ , separating metastable and unstable regions . the spinodal line obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfactant ] ) is @xmath20 and it lies within the coexistence region of the phase diagram .",
    "in addition , the coexisting curve limiting the two phase region ( _ the binodal line _ ) is easily found from eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfactant ] ) as the system is symmetric about @xmath21 : @xmath22 the spinodal and binodal lines join together at the critical point @xmath21 , @xmath23 . in fig .  1",
    "the binodal line and the critical point are shown for a pure surfactant monolayer .",
    "the polymer in the sub - phase is assumed to be neutral and flexible as well as in good solvent conditions , hence with a positive second virial coefficient and no polymer - solvent phase separation . for a semi - dilute polymer solution , a mean field theory applied to the edwards density functional method",
    "is commonly used @xcite .",
    "the free energy density is conveniently expressed as a function of the variable @xmath24 related to @xmath25 , the local monomer concentration , by @xmath26 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath27 denotes the perpendicular distance from the interface , and @xmath28 is the concentration of the polymer in the bulk ( acting as a reservoir ) .",
    "the characteristic length in the solution is the edwards correlation length @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the excluded volume parameter ( positive , in good solvent conditions ) , and the typical energy parameter ( per @xmath2 ) for the interactions between monomers in the bulk is @xmath31 . using these notations ,",
    "the free energy per site reads : @xmath32    the first term accounts for the elastic flexibility of the polymer chains and the second originates from the excluded volume interaction combined with the equilibrium condition with the polymer bulk reservoir .",
    "the polymer free energy @xmath6 is a functional of the polymer profile @xmath33 and of the order parameter at the interface @xmath34 .",
    "it does not include the energy of interaction with the surface , discussed separately below .",
    "minimizing @xmath6 with respect to the polymer profile @xmath35 , leaving the surface value as a free parameter , yields the polymer profile @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a constant of integration related to @xmath38 by @xmath39 , in the case of adsorption ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 in the case of depletion ( @xmath42 ) , where , similarly , @xmath43 . for both adsorption and depletion ,",
    "the free energy @xmath6 for the optimal profile is @xmath44 and has a minimum at @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the polymer solution would like to be homogeneous throughout the solution at the imposed bulk value @xmath46 .",
    "the only possibility of obtaining a profile with @xmath47 is due to the short range coupling of the polymer with the surface .",
    "this coupling includes the surfactant monolayer as well as the bare air / water interface .",
    "it is given below by the term @xmath7 .",
    "a quantity accessible to experiment which measures the total adsorption of the monomers at the interface is the polymer surface excess defined as @xmath48 . using the above results of the minimization for the polymer profile ( mean - field theory )",
    ", it is simply related to @xmath38 by    @xmath49    note that , if @xmath50 is the volume fraction of the monomers in the bulk solution , a naive calculation starting from @xmath51 ( where @xmath52 is the size of a monomer ) yields @xmath53 . for a semi - dilute polymer solution , @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the number of monomers in a chain ) .",
    "hence , roughly , for @xmath56 the range for typical values of @xmath57 is given @xcite by @xmath58 .",
    "although the self - consistent field theory provides a convenient and qualitatively correct framework for the description of the semi - dilute polymer solution , some of its predictions ( like the form of the polymer profile @xmath25 for instance ) are in disagreement with a scaling theory @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will use it to model the polymer behavior in solution .",
    "a bilinear term in the surfactant and monomer concentrations at the interface ( @xmath59 ) is a simple , yet meaningful , phenomenological coupling for the polymer - interface interaction , which is assumed to be short - ranged : @xmath60 \\phi_{s}^{2 }            = - \\frac{1}{2 } \\epsilon_{ps } ( c - c^{\\star } ) \\phi_{s}^{2 } \\label{eq : coupling}\\ ] ] @xmath61 is the polymer / surfactant interaction parameter , and @xmath62 is the polymer / bare interface interaction parameter . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) , we define the  _ effective _ \" polymer / surfactant interaction parameter @xmath63 .",
    "it is positive whenever the monomers interact more favorably with the surfactant molecules than with the bare water / air interface .",
    "the _ special transition _",
    "coverage is defined as @xmath64 . in principle , those parameters can depend on temperature .",
    "the phenomenological coupling @xmath7 can be justified for polymers in the semi - dilute regime since in such systems the monomers concentration is small with respect to unity .",
    "however , it represents only the lowest term in an expansion in the surfactant concentration at the interface .",
    "when @xmath65 , the @xmath7 term corresponds to a repulsion of the polymer from the surface ( depletion ) for @xmath66 and to an attraction to the surface ( adsorption ) for @xmath67 .",
    "the special transition line @xmath68 occurs for physical values of the coverage , @xmath69 , when the attraction ( repulsion ) of the monomers with the surfactant molecules is in competition with the repulsion ( attraction ) with the bare interface . in the @xmath69 range ,",
    "a positive @xmath61 is equivalent to having a positive @xmath70 and means that the interaction between the monomers and the surfactant molecules is attractive .",
    "combining all three contributions , @xmath71 , we obtain the total free energy ( per site of the interface and per @xmath15 ) : @xmath72 note that the energy is invariant under the transformation @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , it will be assumed in the following that @xmath65 without loss of generality .    the free energy @xmath1 is a function of @xmath38 and @xmath9 . minimizing it first with respect to the polymer surface order parameter @xmath38 ( mean field approximation ) , we obtain @xmath76 where @xmath77 measures the strength of the interaction between the polymer and the overall interface ( including the bare interface as well as the surfactant ) . equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) relates @xmath78 , the concentration of monomers at the interface , with the surfactant area fraction @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the entire polymer profile and the polymer surface excess can be found as a function of the surfactant concentration on the interface .",
    "the limit of a very strong adsorption , @xmath79 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath80 ) , yields @xmath81 . on the other hand , the limit of very strong depletion , @xmath82 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath83 ) , yields @xmath84 . for @xmath85 ( _ e.g.",
    "_ , @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 , which means that the polymer solution remains homogeneous : @xmath46 , even at the surface .",
    "as is shown in fig .",
    "2a , the special transition line @xmath88 divides the parameter range into an adsorption region ( @xmath89 ) and a depletion one ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "if the surfactant monolayer is in the two - phase region , dilute and condensed regions of the surfactant coexist , and the polymer adsorbs differently on those regions because of its different affinity as described by the parameter @xmath91 . note that as the curve @xmath92 is convex ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , the polymer surface excess is enhanced when the surfactant monolayer undergoes a phase separation .",
    "qualitatively , the convexity of the curve @xmath92 indicates @xcite that the surfactant concentration fluctuations increase the average polymer surface concentration @xmath38 and , hence , the polymer surface excess @xmath93 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : phi ] ) shows how the surfactant molecules affect the polymer adsorption .",
    "the main remaining task is to understand how the polymer itself affects the phase diagram of the surfactant monolayer , since the two problems are coupled . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) , @xmath94 , the total free energy can be written only as a function of the surfactant coverage @xmath9 : @xmath95 the study of the convexity of the total free energy @xmath96 as a function of @xmath9 ( the only remaining order parameter ) determines the location of the _ modified _ spinodal line .",
    "similarly , the full phase diagram can be obtained numerically from a common - tangent construction of @xmath96 .    for sake of clarity ,",
    "the main physical features can be illustrated in a simple situation .",
    "this is done in the next section , where @xmath57 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are taken to be independent of the temperature @xmath4 , and @xmath99 .",
    "a more general treatment without any assumptions on the @xmath4-dependence of the interaction parameters is presented in appendices a and b.",
    "@xmath100 is independent of the temperature if we assume that the interaction potential of the surfactant molecules has an infinite repulsive core followed by a weak attraction independent of the temperature , @xmath101 .",
    "in such a case , the surfactant second virial coefficient is given by @xmath102 .",
    "expanding the energy @xmath5 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : surfactant ] ) , in powers of @xmath9 shows that the virial expansion @xcite is equivalent to the bragg - williams theory ( at low concentrations ) with @xmath103 .",
    "thus @xmath104 is independent of the temperature .",
    "note that the strength of this attraction @xmath105 is related to the critical temperature of the pure surfactant monolayer by @xmath106 .",
    "for the semi - dilute polymer solution , taking only excluded volume interactions between monomers and assuming an athermal solvent , @xmath30 and @xmath57 are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "we also assume that the interaction between the monomers and the bare interface is independent of the temperature , resulting in @xmath107 since the dimensionless @xmath62 is rescaled in units of @xmath15 . in a similar manner , neglecting the steric effects between the monomers and the surfactant molecules , and assuming that the monomer / surfactant interactions are attractive , weak and short - ranged , results in @xmath108 . under these conditions @xmath98 and @xmath97 are independent of @xmath4 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the phase diagram in the simplified case can be plotted in the @xmath109 plane and is a cut of the _ global _ phase diagram ( presented in the appendices ) plotted in the ( @xmath110 ) space .",
    "the next subsections will present some features of this simplified case .",
    "we limit ourselves to @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath65 ; @xmath112 corresponds to an attraction between the surfactant molecules ; @xmath113 follows from the assumption that the polymer is in a good solvent ( its excluded volume parameter @xmath30 is positive ) , and @xmath65 can be used without loss of generality , as was explained in sec .",
    "the spinodal line @xmath114 of the mixed surfactant - polymer system is obtained from the condition @xmath115 the critical point is the extremum point on the spinodal , satisfying in addition @xmath116 equation ( [ eq : spin0 ] ) shows that the spinodal temperature @xmath117 is shifted upwards @xcite and the region of instability is increased .",
    "physically , this general effect comes from the indirect attractive interaction between the surfactant molecules induced by the polymer , and was already explained elsewhere @xcite . here , it is represented by the term @xmath118 in the free energy .",
    "it is bigger for larger values of the surfactant concentration @xmath9 because @xmath92 is an increasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the phase diagram is no longer symmetric around @xmath119 .",
    "the shift on the spinodal and binodal lines is bigger for the large values of @xmath9 and the critical point is shifted to a concentration @xmath120 .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss several limits and try to show that ( except in the low - coupling limit ) the position of the special transition line @xmath88 in the @xmath109 plane crucially affects the phase diagram .",
    "this can be checked easily in the limits of very high and very low surfactant concentration , where the scaling of the spinodal temperature @xmath117 is analytically derived and depends on the relative position of the spinodal line with respect to the special transition line .",
    "three cases can be distinguished in the @xmath123 limit of the spinodal line :    * if @xmath124 , the polymer is strongly depleted from the interface .",
    "the shift of the spinodal temperature @xmath114 from the pure value @xmath125 is small and scales as @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the pure surfactant spinodal line ( no added polymer ) . * on the other hand , if @xmath128 , the polymer is strongly attracted by the interface and @xmath117 scales as @xmath129 . * in the special case when @xmath130 , the polymer solution remains homogeneous .",
    "the dominant term in the spinodal equation also changes and @xmath117 scales as @xmath131 .",
    "the scaling of the spinodal temperature in the limit @xmath122 depends similarly on the position of the special transition line relatively to the line @xmath132 . in the following ,",
    "the other regions of the phase diagram are considered and @xmath18 is at least of order unity .      in the case",
    "when @xmath134 is small enough @xcite , the third term in the spinodal equation ( [ eq : spin0 ] ) is negligible .",
    "the phase diagram is very similar to that of the pure surfactant monolayer ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the spinodal temperature @xmath114 as well as the binodal temperature @xmath135 can be expanded in powers of @xmath134 . to second order in @xmath134 ,",
    "the shift of the binodal line is identical to the shift of the spinodal line : @xmath136 for the low - coupling limit , the critical temperature is shifted upwards @xcite by a factor of order @xmath137 . note that , to second order in @xmath134 , the shift is independent on the surfactant area fraction and the special transition coverage @xmath97 .",
    "the critical concentration @xmath138 is also shifted upwards , but only to third order in @xmath134 , : @xmath139 another case where the third term in the spinodal equation ( [ eq : spin0 ] ) is negligible is when @xmath140 . here ,",
    "the polymer is very strongly depleted from the interface .",
    "this occurs , for instance , when @xmath141 and @xmath90 .",
    "we define the strong coupling limit as the situation when the spinodal line is strongly shifted upwards , @xmath142 and the first term in the spinodal equation ( [ eq : spin0 ] ) is negligible .",
    "@xmath70 is the only parameter left in the equation depending on the temperature .",
    "as @xmath143 , the temperature on the spinodal line is proportional to the parameter @xmath134 and the coefficient of proportionality @xmath144 is obtained from the spinodal equation ( [ eq : spin0 ] ) rewritten as a fifth order equation for @xmath70 depending on @xmath57 , @xmath97 and @xmath9 ( and independent of @xmath134 ) : @xmath145 whenever eq .",

    "4a shows a plot of the free energy in a case where this sudden decrease of @xmath96 for @xmath89 is particularly well defined .",
    "when @xmath161 , the binodal line of the pure surfactant monolayer can be obtained with a common tangent construction ( in the range of temperatures where the two coexistence concentrations are lower than the special transition coverage @xmath97 ) . however , it corresponds to a metastable state .",
    "there is yet a second pair of coexisting concentrations which leads even to a lower free energy .    when @xmath69 , the phase diagram of the strong coupling limit predominates over the one of the pure surfactant monolayer , while for @xmath157 this is not the case anymore .",
    "for physical values of the parameters , the transition between the two regimes , occurring around @xmath162 , is smooth . in some situations ,",

    "6 we show for the same set of parameters three typical isotherms plotted in the reduced surface pressure @xmath163  reduced area per surfactant plane .",
    "the reduced surface pressure is defined by rescaling the actual surface pressure ( _ i.e. _ , the difference between the bare water / air surface tension and that of the surfactant monolayer ) by @xmath164 , resulting in the relation @xmath165 .",

    "the coupling between the tail conformations and the concentration of the surfactant molecules becomes crucial at high surfactant densities and can lead to a rich phase behavior @xcite , which was not addressed here .",
    "we consider here only the dilute phases of surfactant monolayers : the gaseous phase at low densities and temperatures , the liquid - expanded phase at higher densities and the condensation transition between them @xcite .",

    "the assumption that the polymer solution is semi - dilute may break down close to the interface if the polymer strongly adsorbs .",

    "we are not aware of many experiments performed on adsorption of polymers on a langmuir monolayer , which will allow a direct comparison with our results @xcite .",
    "interesting polymers that can be used experimentally to test our theory are hydrophobically modified water soluble polymers ( hm - wsp ) @xcite,@xcite@xcite .",
    "these _ associating _ copolymers are attracted by the bare interface because of short hydrophobic side chains , attached covalently to the main chain . by adjusting the number and the length of the side chains , one can directly modify their surface affinity . in our model",

    "figure 7 shows two different kinds of interaction between the monomers and the interface . in ( a )",
    ", monomers interact with the interface through any kind of short - ranged interaction : either attractive or repulsive . in ( b ) , the attraction of hm - wsp polymers towards the interface is illustrated : one of the aliphatic side chains of a hm - wsp polymer is in a low energy state in the air subphase .",
    "the monomers of the main chain covalently bound to this aliphatic group are consequently attracted in the region of the interface .",
    "the hm - wsp polymers can be used to study systematically the dependence of the phase diagram on the special transition concentration @xmath97 ( as well as on the coupling parameter @xmath70 ) , including the interesting situation where the special transition line intersects the phase diagram ( @xmath69 ) because the polymer is repelled from the surfactant molecules ( @xmath171 ) .",
    "the surfactant can be chosen as nonionic , with a polar head ( hydrophilic ) identical to the monomers , resulting in a repulsion between the  brush \" ( formed by the polar heads ) and the polymer ( water being a good solvent for both ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting coupling parameter @xmath70 is negative and the triple point occurs for values of @xmath97 close to zero and not close to unity as when @xmath65 ( fig .  5 )",
    "however , such polymers usually have a complicated behavior in the bulk and their self - assembly properties may be crucial .",
    "another possible candidate for experiments may be a polymer with a  simpler \" behavior in water , like peo , having a surface affinity @xcite . probably here",
    "one needs to treat more explicitly the hydrogen bonds .",
    "the parameters in the model can also be tuned by changing the surfactant characteristics .",
    "pentadecanoic acid , for example , whose gaseous to liquid expanded transition has already been studied by several authors @xcite , can probably be an interesting surfactant to use .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , several phase diagrams for the mixed polymer - surfactant system have been proposed from qualitative and general arguments .",
    "the proposed phase diagrams exhibit the special transition line for the polymer ( @xmath88 ) and the coexistence line for the surfactant molecules , but the interaction between these two lines was not treated in detail .",
    "our results suggest that the position of the special transition line has a very strong effect on the position of the coexistence line .",
    "@xcite also predicted a _",
    "@xmath172 line _ separating a region where the polymer segregates from the surfactant from a region where the polymer and surfactant are mixed together .",
    "our mean - field model does not address directly this prediction since we have only one minimum of the polymer surface value @xmath38 as a function of surfactant coverage @xmath9 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) ] , and we assume that the polymer solution is homogeneous in the directions parallel to the interface as long as the surfactant monolayer is homogeneous .",
    "> from our study it seems that the @xmath172 line of ref . @xcite and the coexistence line are the same : regions of different concentrations for the polymer correspond to regions of different concentrations for the surfactant .",
    "the polymer can be attracted to the interface and segregate from the surfactant only if it is attracted by the bare interface but repelled by the surfactant molecules .",
    "this situation is driven by energy terms which are first order in the polymer concentration [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : coupling ] ) ] and is consequently different from the one predicted in ref .",
    "it will be interesting to understand in a detailed way this discrepancy , especially for @xmath173 , where the coupling between the special transition and the surfactant phase diagram leads to the richest variety of phenomena .",
    "we addressed in detail the adsorption of a semi - dilute polymer solution on a surfactant monolayer , and the resulting phase diagrams . in our model ,",
    "the most important degree of freedom is the local concentration @xmath9 of surfactant at the interface . since the monomers interact with regions of different concentrations with an energy proportional to @xmath174 ( @xmath97 is the concentration at the _ special transition _ ) , a rich variety of phenomena results from the coupling between the polymer solution and the surfactant monolayer .",
    "the polymer surface excess is enhanced and the phase diagrams of the surfactant monolayer are modified .",
    "the monomers induce an additional indirect attraction between the surfactant molecules depending on the concentration of surfactant on the interface .",
    "consequently , the range of the homogeneous region in the phase diagram decreases .",
    "when the monomers interact more favorably with the surfactant molecules than with the bare interface , the critical concentration itself increases .",
    "the value of the special transition coverage @xmath97 , describing the interaction of the monomers with the surfactant molecules relatively to their interaction with the bare water / air interface , has a major effect on the phase diagram of the surfactant monolayer .",
    "when the monomers are repelled by the surfactant molecules as well as by the bare interface ( for instance , @xmath65 and @xmath157 ) , the phase diagram is not very different from the one of a simple surfactant monolayer without polymer in the water subphase . on the other hand , when the monomers are attracted by the surfactant molecules as well as by the bare interface",
    "( for instance , @xmath65 and @xmath128 ) , the increase of the two - phase region can be important . in the intermediary situation both",
    "when the polymer is attracted to the interface or depleted ( @xmath69 ) , these two scenarios are in competition leading to a rich phase behavior and in some cases , the phase diagram displays two critical points and one triple point ( as in fig .  5 and 9k ) .",
    "finally , we mention two possible extensions of the present study .",
    "the first is to consider the situation of soluble surfactants , and to take into account the complex surfactant - polymer interactions in the bulk .",
    "interesting experimental results have been obtained for such systems@xcite . moreover",
    ", our model can easily be adapted to mixed monolayers with two components .",
    "such binary mixtures have been shown to exhibit immiscibility at room temperature , ( _ e.g. _ , for cholesterol and dmpc @xcite ) .",
    "the understanding of the features of this phase transition may help to understand interactions of polymers with flexible membranes ( lipid bilayer ) and the phenomenon of _ budding _ of membranes @xcite .",

    "when @xmath57 is big , the polymer stiffness enforces the polymer solution to be uniform , @xmath228 , and the monomers exert a strong uniform attraction on the surfactant molecules .    for @xmath218 , there is a phase separation , provided that @xmath57 is small enough .",

    "when @xmath17 is changed , the basic topology of the binodal and spinodal lines remains unchanged .",
    "but , in the limit @xmath229 , close to the region where a phase separation occurs even without a coupling , the value of @xmath57 at the critical point increases .",
    "moreover , the critical concentration tends to the value of the non - coupling case @xmath119 ( because @xmath57 at the critical point is large ) . if , on the other hand @xmath17 decreases , the value of @xmath57 at the critical point decreases and the critical concentration @xmath138 increases , @xmath230 when @xmath231 .    for @xmath219 ,",
    "the phase diagram is presented in fig .",
    "there is no critical point because the phase separation occurs for all values of @xmath57 . for @xmath151 , the effects of the coupling between the monomers and the surfactant molecules are the strongest : the polymer is strongly attracted to the interface , particularly in the regions dense in surfactant . as a result , the surfactant molecules aggregate with a close - packing coverage @xmath132 .",
    "the opposite situation happens when both the surfactant and the bare interface repel the monomers . as explained above it",

    "the spinodal equation has no solution and the homogeneous monolayer state is stable .",
    "for @xmath236 , from a topological point of view , the spinodal surface is deformed for intermediate values of @xmath57 .",
    "whereas for large values of @xmath57 , the polymer remains stiff and the properties of the phase transition are those of the non - coupling case , for small values of @xmath57 , the repulsion of the interface is dominant .",
    "the polymer is strongly depleted and the coupling has no effect .",
    "the cuts of the phase diagram in the direction ( @xmath186 ) have the following features :    * for @xmath237 the phase diagram has a closed loop immiscibility curve with an upper and a lower critical points as shown on fig .",
    "when @xmath229 , the upper critical point tends to @xmath238 and the lower one to @xmath239 , whereas when @xmath240 , the domain of instability becomes very small .",

    "an example of such a case is presented in fig .",
    "the line of critical points has only , for intermediate values of @xmath57 , a small distortion with respect to the straight line of the non - coupling case .",
    "one consequence is that there is a maximal value for the critical concentration .",
    "when @xmath97 is increased , the repulsion from the interface increases and the phase diagram resembles the non - coupling case , even at intermediate values of @xmath57 .",
    "we turn now to the more complex case where the special transition line intersects the physical range of parameter space ( @xmath242 ) .",
    "the situation for @xmath243 is rather simple , and two typical phase diagrams are shown in figs .",
    "9f ( for @xmath244 ) and 9 g and ( for @xmath245 ) .",
    "they resemble the @xmath128 case .",
    "however , for @xmath209 , depending on the value of the coupling parameter @xmath70 , the competition between the different terms in the free energy leads to a large variety of possible phase diagrams .",
    "an example of a phase diagram with a reentrant phase is presented in fig .",
    "9h . in fig .",
    "9i yet another type of a phase diagram is presented where a second metastable region resides inside the two phase region . in some cases , as was suggested at the end of appendix a , the phase diagram appears as if it is composed of two disconnected parts ( those are cuts obtained for @xmath246 ) .",
