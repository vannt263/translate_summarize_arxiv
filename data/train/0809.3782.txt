    "recent successes in manufacturing of atomically thin graphite samples @xcite ( graphene ) have stimulated intense experimental and theoretical activity @xcite .",
    "the key feature of graphene is the massless dirac type of low - energy electron excitations .",
    "this gives rise to a number of remarkable physical properties of this system distinguishing it from conventional two - dimensional metals .",
    "one of the most prominent features of graphene is the `` minimal conductivity '' at the neutrality ( dirac ) point . specifically , the conductivity@xcite of an undoped sample is close to @xmath2 per spin per valley , remaining almost constant in a very broad temperature range  from room temperature down to 30mk .",
    "several recent theoretical works addressed transport in disordered graphene samples . it was found that localization properties depend strongly on the nature of disorder @xcite which determines the symmetry and topology of the corresponding field theory .",
    "the localization is absent provided a certain symmetry of clean graphene hamiltonian is preserved in the disordered sample , see ref ..    one possibility is that disorder preserves a chiral symmetry of massless dirac fermions .",
    "this situation is , in particular , realized when the dominant disorder is due to corrugations of graphene sheet ( ripples ) and/or dislocations .",
    "@xcite the conductivity in such chiral - symmetric models has been shown @xcite to be exactly @xmath3 ( per spin per valley ) at the dirac point . while being temperature independent , this value is , however , less by a factor of @xmath4 than the experimentally measured values .",
    "another possibility , a long - range randomness , was studied in ref .. this type of disorder does not mix the two valleys of the graphene spectrum , which leads to emergence of a topological term in the corresponding field theory ( unitary or symplectic @xmath5-model ) .",
    "the peculiar topological properties protect the system from localization @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a topologically protected metallic state emerging in graphene with long - range random potential also arises at a surface of a three - dimensional @xmath6 topological insulator .",
    "@xcite    a number of numerical simulations of electron transport in disordered graphene @xcite confirmed the absence of localization in the presence of long - range random potential .",
    "the main quantity studied numerically in most of these works is the conductance @xmath7 of a finite - size graphene sample with a width @xmath0 much larger than the length @xmath1 .",
    "this setup allows one to define the `` conductivity '' @xmath8 even for ballistic samples with @xmath1 much shorter than the mean free path @xmath9 .",
    "remarkably , in graphene at the dirac point , such ballistic `` conductivity '' has a universal value @xmath3 in the clean case .",
    "@xcite this setup was studied experimentally in refs . and",
    "the ballistic value @xmath3 was indeed observed for large aspect ratios .",
    "this geometry of samples is particularly advantageous for the analysis of evolution from the ballistic to diffusive transport .",
    "a complete description of the electron transport through a finite system involves not only the conductance but also higher cumulants of the distribution of transferred charge .",
    "the second moment is related to the current noise in the system .",
    "the intensity of the shot noise is characterized by the fano factor @xmath10 . for clean graphene",
    ", this quantity was studied in ref .  .",
    "surprisingly , in a short and wide sample ( @xmath11 ) the fano factor takes the universal value @xmath12 , that coincides with the well - known result for a diffusive metallic wire .",
    "@xcite this is at odds with usual clean metallic systems , where the shot noise is absent ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the fano factor @xmath14 in clean graphene is attributed @xcite to the fact that the current is mediated by evanescent rather than propagating modes .",
    "furthermore , the whole distribution of transmission eigenvalues for the massless dirac equation in a clean sample with @xmath15 at the dirac point agrees with that of mesoscopic metallic wires in the diffusive regime . @xcite",
    "the effect of disorder on the shot noise was studied numerically in refs . , where the value of the fano factor @xmath16 was found across the whole crossover form ballistics to diffusion .",
    "the fano factor close to @xmath17 was also observed at the dirac point experimentally .",
    "@xcite when the chemical potential was shifted away from the dirac point , the fano factor decreased , then showed an intermediate shoulder at @xmath18 , and finally approached zero for largest gate voltages ( carrier concentrations ) .",
    "while both diffusive and clean limits have been addressed analytically , only numerical and experimental results for the intermediate regime of ballistic transport through disordered samples have been available so far.@xcite the aim of this paper is to fill this gap .",
    "we develop the analytic theory of electron transport in disordered graphene in the ballistic geometry ( @xmath19 ) and calculate the full statistics of the charge transfer for both zero ( the dirac point ) and large concentration of carriers .",
    "we also discuss the crossover to diffusive regime and construct the overall `` phase diagram '' of transport regimes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : tmatrix ] with the introduction of the model and derivation of a general transfer - matrix equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : clean ] we calculate transport properties of a clean sample . in sec .",
    "[ sec : first - correction ] the disorder is included in the lowest order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the resummation of leading higher - order corrections to the counting statistics is performed within the renormalization group approach in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] . for the case of random potential",
    "we present an evidence in favor of a universal scaling of the distribution function of transmission coefficients valid at the dirac point for samples of arbitrary size ( covering both ballistic and diffusive regimes ) .",

    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "technical details are relegated to appendices [ app : oscillations ] , [ app : twoloop ] , and [ app : oneloop ] .",
    "we start with introducing our model and the general formalism of transfer matrix technique . for graphene ,",
    "this approach was employed in refs ..    we will adopt the single - valley model of graphene . more specifically , we will consider scattering of electrons only within a single valley and neglect intervalley scattering events . indeed , a number of experimental results show that the dominant disorder in graphene scatters electrons within the same valley .",
    "first , this disorder model is supported by the odd - integer quantization@xcite of the hall conductivity , @xmath20 , representing a direct evidence@xcite in favor of smooth disorder which does not mix the valleys .",
    "the analysis of weak localization also corroborates the dominance of intra - valley scattering@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the observation of the linear density dependence@xcite of graphene conductivity away from the dirac point implies that the relevant disorder is due to charged impurities and/or ripples.@xcite due to the long - range character of these types of disorder , the intervalley scattering amplitudes are strongly suppressed and will be neglected in our treatment .",
    "finally , apparent absence of localization at the dirac point down to very low temperatures@xcite can be explained only by some special symmetry of disorder .",
    "the most realistic candidate model is the long - range randomness which does not scatter between valleys .",
    "@xcite    the single - valley massless dirac hamiltonian of electrons in graphene has the form ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) @xmath21 here @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) are pauli matrices acting on the electron pseudospin degree of freedom corresponding to the sublattice structure of the honeycomb lattice , @xmath24 , and the fermi velocity is @xmath25 cm / s .",
