    "1 . taking a drude model for the wire conductivity leads to a frequency dependent total capacitance according to @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the resistance of the wire and @xmath69 is the relaxation time @xcite . using eqs .",

    "it is found that the role of @xmath68 is more pronounced for smaller @xmath1 as the effect is stronger for smaller @xmath68 values , according to fig .",
    "similar conclusion is obtained by considering the dependence of @xmath70 vs @xmath68 , shown in fig .",

    "casimir and van der waals forces are universal and of great importance in nature , especially when the scale goes down to micrometer distances and below",
    ". this type of interaction , induced by dipolar fluctuations , can be essential in determining the behavior of nanostructures and devices .",
    "yet there are many other fluctuation induced forces that become important at such small scales . here",
    "we consider charge induced fluctuation forces in capacitive systems .",
    "the developed theory utilizes static and frequency dependent capacitance , and it is applied in graphene based structures .",
    "the total capacitance contains both a geometrical and a collective electronic component . just like in the casimir / van der",
    "waals forces , we distinguish between thermal and quantum mechanical effects .",
    "the thermal fluctuations are pronounced at larger separations where the geometrical capacitance dominates , while the quantum fluctuations are relevant for smaller separations .",
    "the origin of this induced interaction comes from fluctuating charges , which is a key difference when compared to the casimir / van der waals interaction that originates from fluctuating polarizations .",
    "this is important for understanding the @xmath66 asymptotic distance dependence as compared to the @xmath82 dependence of the thermal casimir force .",
    "similarly , the quantum mechanical regime of @xmath81 is of much longer range as compared to the metal / graphene quantum mechanical asymptotics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is also important to note that the geometrical capacitance takes into account the geometry of the system in a rather straight forward manner .",
    "this is unlike the casimir force , where non - trivial geometry is usually difficult to describe theoretically .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that capacitance can be found for objects with non - trivial boundary conditions via electrostatic methods , while electromagnetic boundary conditions are not easily solved beyond highly symmetric extensions .",
    "another interesting feature is the role of the size of the system .",
    "the charge fluctuations force is explicitly dependent on the area of the interacting objects , which is not the case for the casimir / vdw force.the charge fluctuations interaction is @xmath83 for the thermal and @xmath84 for the quantum mechanical regimes . balancing the longer ranged asymptotics and",
    "the area dependence can be used to enhance the charge fluctuations force over the typical casimir interaction .",
    "systems , such as graphene ribbons , which have smaller area as compared to large graphene flakes , are especially good candidates to observe this effect .    in summary",
    ", we argue that charge fluctuation forces are always present in capacitor - like systems .",
    "they must be considered in conjunction with the standard casimir interaction as the charge fluctuation force can be comparable or even bigger in magnitude .",
    "charge fluctuation forces enable further probing of thermal and quantum mechanical effects due to fluctuation induced phenomena in nanostructured materials such as graphene and gnrs .",
    "we finally point out that it is worthwhile to pursue further the effects of fluctuation forces due to not just electromagnetic fluctuations but also due to other thermodynamic parameters , for they will necessarily have an important effect in many nanostructures and devices .",
