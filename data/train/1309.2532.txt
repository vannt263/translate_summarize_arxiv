    "the ability to process information at the single - photon level has become a crucial prerequisite for quantum communications @xcite .",
    "implementations of networks based on single photons face the challenge of bridging the frequency at which the nodes optimally operate with the telecom band frequency at which transmission losses in optical fibers are minimized .",
    "a possible solution is to frequency convert single - photon wave packets into and back from the telecom band wavelengths using multi - wave mixing in nonlinear devices @xcite .",
    "several experiments have demonstrated frequency conversion of light , e.g. , nonclassical states of light @xcite and weak coherent states , both in upconversion ( infrared to visible ) @xcite and downconversion ( visible to infrared ) @xcite .",
    "very recently quantum frequency conversion of single photon states was demonstrated both in upconversion @xcite and downconversion @xcite .",
    "for single photons it has been proven that some of their classical ( coherence ) and non - classical ( photon statistics ) properties are conserved in the frequency conversion process @xcite .",
    "all of the experiments mentioned so far used three - wave mixing in nonlinear ( @xmath0 ) crystals .",
    "however , frequency conversion can also be efficiently achieved making use of four - wave mixing ( fwm ) in @xmath1 materials ( e.g. bragg scattering in nonlinear fibers or fwm in atomic gases ) as demonstrated for weak coherent fields @xcite and heralded single photons @xcite .",
    "we mention that the use of atomic ensembles as nonlinear media for single - photon frequency conversion is also being discussed @xcite , and has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this latter approach offers a smaller bandwidth compared with nonlinear crystals , but also a better perspective for achieving coherent control @xcite .",
    "since these devices shall be integrated in a quantum network , it is important to determine their efficiency at the single - photon level .",
    "this thus requires to evaluate the efficiency making use of a model describing propagation of quantum electromagnetic radiation in a medium , which we here assume to be a @xmath0 crystal .",
    "this model shall include losses and detrimental scattering processes , which can generate photons in the considered frequency width and/or modify the spectral and coherence properties of the frequency - converted photon at the crystal s output , and are thus a source of noise .",
    "studies on frequency conversion between three modes have appeared for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite : these works describe three - wave mixing in absence of noise and losses and do not take into account propagation inside the medium . in ref .",
    "@xcite the theoretical model has been extended to a multi - mode case in which the pump field is pulsed but noise and losses are not taken into account .",
    "noise and losses in the conversion process are critical in determining the efficiency of the operation at the single - photon level @xcite .",
    "typical noise sources are optical parametric fluorescence ( opf ) @xcite and raman scattering @xcite , which can be both induced by the intense laser field required for the conversion process . to take into account realistic conditions for the frequency conversion process ,",
    "in this article we discuss a theoretical model for single - photon frequency conversion in a non - linear crystal including noise and losses in the propagation dynamics .",
    "we consider a continuous pump laser and first extend the model in refs .",
    "@xcite in order to include propagation of the photon field , using the quantum theory developed in refs .",
    "we identify the conditions for which a periodic exchange of single - photon excitations between the input and the target frequency band occurs .",

    "in this section we start from the equation for the propagation of the photon field in an ideal @xmath0 medium using the theoretical description developed in refs . @xcite . here , we identify the conditions under which a periodic exchange of photonic excitation between input and target frequency band occurs during the propagation inside the crystal .",
    "we then introduce the loss terms by means of quantum reservoirs @xcite and solve the corresponding heisenberg - langevin equations of motion for the photon field .",
    "these equations allow us to determine the correlation functions of a train of photons after interaction with the crystal as a function of the input state and of the noise during the propagation dynamics .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the hamiltonian for non - degenerate three - wave mixing in a lossless dielectric medium of length @xmath2 , where the three coupled optical modes are at frequency @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "equations   and   are valid under a series of conditions . in first place , we have neglected noise effects , which will be treated in the next section .",
    "we also neglected dispersion during the propagation inside the nonlinear crystal , which relies on the fulfillment of the inequality @xmath66 with @xmath67 the interaction time , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the typical dispersion around the wave vector mean value .",
    "we also assumed that the group velocities of idler and pump are equal , which practically implies that @xmath70 when the bandwidth of the input photon is sufficiently small , then @xmath69 is determined by the interaction , @xmath71 . using @xmath72 , the two inequalities to fulfill become @xmath73 the derivation of eqs . and",

    "another approximation we made was to neglect spontaneous down - conversion processes which correspond to the absorption of a pump photon followed by the spontaneous emission of a signal and a idler photon .",
    "these processes are also detrimental for frequency down - conversion purposes , since the idler photon has a larger line width due to correlations with the signal photon . they can be neglected provided that the number of spontaneous emission events during propagation of a single photon are negligible , which is verified when the corresponding rate @xmath76 fulfills the inequality @xmath77 .    before concluding this section",
