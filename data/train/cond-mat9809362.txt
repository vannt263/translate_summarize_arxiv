    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian is one of the simplest nontrivial model to describe how doped holes move on the af spin background and is widely used to characterize the physics in the @xmath2 layers of cuprates .",
    "a tremendous effort has been contributed to the investigation of the @xmath0 model .",
    "the most popular approaches to the metallic phase are often based on the so - called slave - boson method@xcite in which the degrees of freedom associated with spins are described in terms of _ fermionic _ description .",
    "there have been many proposals of mean - field ground states based on such a fermionic description of spins , ranging from the earlier fermionic rvb states,@xcite gauge - theory description,@xcite @xmath3 formalism,@xcite to possible fractional - statistics.@xcite however , there is an inherent problem quite general to the fermionic description of spins : approaches based on it usually fail in faithfully producing correct af correlations especially at small doping .    at half - filling , for example , the exact ground state is known to satisfy the marshall sign rule@xcite ( for a bipartite lattice ) but a fermionic description of spins would show redundant signs : even exchanging two same spins will give rise to a sign change of wavefunction due to the fermionic statistics . under strict enforcement of no double occupancy constraint , those unphysical signs would not have any effect .",
    "but in mean - field approximations , this `` sign problem '' will always show up and cause serious problem like overall underestimate of af correlations .",
    "by contrast , the marshall sign can be easily incorporated into a _ bosonic _",
    "description of spin degrees of freedom , where no extra sign problem would be caused by the statistics of bosons .",
    "it is the reason contributing to the success of the bosonic rvb description@xcite and its mean - field version  the schwinger - boson mean - field approach@xcite in describing spin properties at half - filling .",
    "a variational wavefunction based on the bosonic rvb picture can produce@xcite an unrivaled accurate ground - state energy ( @xmath4 per bond as compared to the exact numerical value of @xmath5 per bond for the heisenberg model ) , and a generalized description@xcite can precisely provide not only the ground - state energy , staggered magnetization , but also spin excitation spectrum in the whole brillouin zone . therefore , a bosonic description of spins seems most natural at half - filling .",
    "it is thus tempting for one to use the bosonic description of spins as a starting point and try to get into the metallic phase by doping .",
    "the connection between antiferromagnetic and metallic phases is commonly perceived important in the @xmath0 model , and is also believed by many to be the key in search for the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "unfortunately , the mean - field study in the schwinger - boson - slave - fermion approach@xcite of the @xmath0 model , which is based on the bosonic description of spins and has been quite successful at half - filling,@xcite soon meets problematic consequences once holes are introduced  encountering the so - called spiral phase and its derivatives.@xcite it seems that one could not avoid such a spiral instability so long as a perturbative approach is adopted.@xcite one of many problems with spiral phases involves an underestimated kinetic energy @xmath6 at weak - doping @xmath7 , which is also accompanied by a very quick descent to ferromagnetic phase at slightly larger @xmath8.@xcite    this implies that doped holes may have introduced some _ singular _ doping effect which has been mistreated in the mean - field approximations .",
    "such a singular doping effect has been recently identified@xcite by reexamining the motion of doped holes in the af background .",
    "it has been found that spin - mismatches caused by the hopping of doped holes can not be completely `` repaired '' through spin flips at low energy .",
    "such a residual nonrepairable effect can be expressed by a path - dependent phase product known as phase string.@xcite due to the phase string effect , a hole slowly moves through a closed path will acquire a nontrivial berry s phase . as this phase string effect is very singular locally at a lattice constant scale , its topological effect can be easily lost if a conventional mean - field average is involved  a reason causing the aforementioned spiral instability .    in order to handle such a singular phase string effect hidden in the conventional schwinger - boson - slave - fermion scheme , a unitary transformation@xcite has been introduced to _",
    "regulate _ the hamiltonian such that the local singularity of the phase string ( at the scale of one lattice constant ) is `` gauged away '' , while its large distance topological consequence is explicitly incorporated into the hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting exact reformulation@xcite of the @xmath0 model is believed to be more suitable for a perturbative treatment , in contrast to the original slave - fermion formalism .",
    "the underlying physical implication is that the `` holon '' and `` spinon '' _ defined _ in the slave - fermion scheme@xcite may not be really separable due to the hidden phase string effect , but those in the new formalism may become truely elementary excitations . in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case ,",
    "correct luttinger - liquid behaviors indeed can be reproduced@xcite after a mean - field decoupling of the spin and charge degrees of freedom in this new scheme .    in this paper , we develop a generalized mean - field - type theory based on this new formalism of the @xmath0 model in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case .",
    "this theory recovers the well - known schwinger - boson mean - field state@xcite at half - filling while predicts a metallic phase at finite doping without encountering any spiral instability .",
    "it offers a unified phase diagram for the @xmath0 model at small doping , in which an insulating aflro phase , an underdoped metallic phase with the phenomena of pseudo - gap and charge inhomogeneity , as well as a uniform metallic phase with `` optimized '' superconducting transition temperature , are all natural consequences happening on a single spin background controlled by bosonic rvb order pairing .",
    "the phase string effect plays a crucial role here to connect those different phases together within a single theoretical framework . a short version of this work",
    "was published earlier.@xcite",
    "in the standard slave - fermion formalism of the @xmath0 hamiltonian , electron annihilation operator @xmath9 is written as @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is fermionic `` holon '' creation operator and @xmath12 is bosonic ( schwinger - boson ) `` spinon '' annihilation operator , satisfying no double occupancy constraint @xmath13 the @xmath0 model , @xmath14 , is composed of two terms : the hopping term @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 and the superexchange term is @xmath17 note that the staggered phase factor @xmath18 in ( [ swb ] ) is introduced@xcite to explicitly track the marshall sign , which leads to the negative sign in ( [ exc ] ) . a sign",
    "@xmath19 then appears in the hopping term ( [ ehop ] ) which is the origin of the phase string effect@xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "due to such a sign , a hole moving from a site @xmath20 to an another site @xmath21 will acquire a sequence of signs , i.e. , a phase string as shown in fig .",
    "1 , which has been shown@xcite to be nonrepairable by the spin flip process governed by @xmath22 .",
    "it implies that the slave - fermion formalism of the @xmath0 model can not be treated in a perturbative way in doped case .",
    "it has been shown that the above singular effect of phase string can be regulated after a unitary transformation.@xcite the resulting new formalism is known as the phase string representation .",

    "so one role of the phase string effect is to turn holons from fermions into bosons .",

    "the mean - field theory based on the bosonic rvb picture is known as the schwinger - boson mean - field theory which was first introduced by arovas and auerbach@xcite .",

    "but since spinons and holons here are treated as independent degrees of freedom , one may neglect the dynamical effect of @xmath117 on spinon part at the mean - field level and replace it by some random flux fluctuations with a strength per plaquette equal to @xmath118 ( one may estimate @xmath119 ) .",
    "this can be justified at low temperature when a bose condensation of holons ( which corresponds to a superconducting condensation as shown later ) occurs , where @xmath117 is expected to be substantially suppressed .",

    "the separation of the latter from @xmath121 then becomes meaningless . in this case",
    ", one may approximately describe the effect of @xmath121 as a collection of randomly distributed @xmath43 flux quanta with the number equal to that of holons . in both limits ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath30 may be neglected .",
    "first of all , we note that the wavefuntion @xmath74 as the solution of the linear equation ( [ ew ] ) is not unique , and it can be always multiplied by an arbitrary global phase factor @xmath122 : i.e. , @xmath123 without changing the order parameter @xmath124 and the mean - field state . correspondingly the bogoliubov transformation can be generally rewritten as @xmath125 in particular ,",
    "@xmath122 can depend on the _ holon _ configurations because the hilbert space of @xmath12 is only well - defined at each given holon configuration due to the no - double - occupancy constraint .",
    "the hopping term will mix the hilbert space of @xmath12 at different holon configurations , and such a freedom in phase choice can be fixed by optimizing the hopping integral of holons below .    now consider the hopping term @xmath15 in ( [ et ] ) . by using the bogoliubov expression for spinon operators ,",

    "if one simply chooses @xmath129 , namely , the phases of @xmath74 to be the same for all hole configurations , then the right - hand side of ( [ bb ] ) vanishes for the nearest - neighboring @xmath40 and @xmath51 . this can be verified by noting that @xmath130 is also a solution of ( [ ew ] ) with an eigenvalue @xmath131 and the cancellation in ( [ bb ] ) stems from the fact that those quantities like @xmath132 and @xmath133 only depend on @xmath83 in ( [ bb ] ) which is symmetric under @xmath134 .",

    "also note that the crossover from @xmath168 phase to @xmath173 phase at high temperature is similar to the half - filling case@xcite which does not correspond to a real phase transition .    in obtaining @xmath167 in fig . 3 by solving ( [ ds ] )",

    "since @xmath197 describes vortices centered at holons , it is like a free - vortex phase as holons move around freely in metallic phase , which resembles a disordered phase in a kosterlitz - thouless - type transition .    only in the case",
    "that holons are localized ( i.e. , in insulating phase ) such that the phase string effect is ineffective , the aflro may be recovered . in this insulating phase , holons are perceived by spinons as localized vortices like in the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor , and by forming `` supercurrents '' to screen those vortices , @xmath197 in @xmath198 can be effectively canceled out by the opposite vorticities generated from spinons .",

    "let us first to inspect how the spinon spectrum @xmath83 is modified by doping . in fig .",

    "the broadening of the solid curve in fig .",
    "4 is due to the redistribution of eigenstates under the fluctuating flux @xmath117 , which is treated as a random flux ( in white noise limit ) here with a maximum strength chosen at @xmath205 per plaquette .",
    "by contrast , the dashed curve marks the positions of sharp peaks of density of states in the limit of @xmath206 .",
    "we find that the bose condensation of spinons can still occur at @xmath202 with @xmath207 ( but not at @xmath206 ) as the solution of ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "recall that the spinon bose condensation stems from the equation ( [ lambda ] ) with a nonzero @xmath103 representing the density of spinons staying at @xmath104 state . in this case",
    ", there would be no solution at low temperature unless @xmath59 takes a value to make @xmath83 gapless such that @xmath179 can balance the difference between the left and right side of the equation , similar to the half - filled case.@xcite in particular , such a bose condensation is found to be sustained up to a finite temperature @xmath208 even in the present 2d case .",
    "this is due to the vanishingly small weight near @xmath209 in the density of states ( in fig .",
    "4 , there is a small tail in the solid curve which extends to @xmath209 ) , where the spinon excitations at low - temperature are not sufficient to destroy the bose condensation as first pointed out in ref . .",
    "it is noted that in principle the strength @xmath210 of the random fluctuations of @xmath117 should be self - consistently determined by the density fluctuations of holons .",
    "but here for simplicity we just treat @xmath210 as a parameter and then study the qualitative characteristics under different values of @xmath210 .",
    "the actual strength of the fluctuations of @xmath30 will be only crucial in determining the location of the phase boundary .",
    "_ phase separation _ note that the bose condensation means a thermodynamic number of spinons staying at @xmath104  the lowest energy state which corresponds to the band edges of the spectrum @xmath211 .",
    "so due to the bose condensation , such quantum states will acquire a macroscopic meaning .",
    "but these band edge states of @xmath82 are very sensitive to the fluctuations of @xmath30 and the density of holons .",
    "physically , the density of holons is fluctuating in real space ( which is the reason leading to the fluctuations of @xmath30 ) and there always exist those configurations in which the density of holes are relatively dilute in some areas where the flux described by @xmath30 is reduced such that the band edge energies of @xmath82 can be close to @xmath212",
    ". since the probability would be small for such kind of inhomogeneous hole configurations , the density of states generally looks like a tail  i.e. , the lifshitz tail near the band edges .",
    "hence , the corresponding bose - condensed state will generally look like having a charge inhomogeneity , or , phase separation , with spinons condensing into hole - deficient regions to form short - range spin ordering .",
    "the true aflro is absent here .",
    "_ pseudo - gap behavior _ the bose condensation of spinons will also lead to a pseudo - gap phenomenon . in magnetic aspect , for example , the density of states shown in fig .",
    "4 indicates the suppression of spinon density of states between zero and the lowest peak , which stabilizes the bose condensation as mentioned earlier .",
    "since in the bose condensation case there must be some residual density extending to @xmath104 , a pseudo spin gap is thus present in @xmath199 .",
    "its effect in the dynamic spin susceptibility will be discussed later . in the transport aspect ,",
    "holons which are the charge carriers are scattered off by the gauge field @xmath41 according to the holon effective hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "anomalies in transport properties have been found in ref . with interesting experimental features in the similar effective hamiltonian , where",
    "fluctuating fluxes depicted by @xmath41 play a central role .",
    "but the bose condensation of spinons will lead to a substantial suppression of @xmath41 and thus a reduction of scattering to holons .",
    "hence , the bose condensation also provides an explanation for the so - called pseudo - gap phenomenon shown in the _ underdoped _",
    "cuprates , where the transport properties deviate from the high temperature ones below some characteristic temperature scale .    therefore ,",
    "if the bose condensation of spinons happens in metallic phase , it will result in a phase - separation or spin pseudo - gap phase without the aflro . with the increase of @xmath8 , the reduction of the left hand side of ( [ lambda ] ) will eventually make the bose condensation term , if exits , disappear from the right hand side .",
    "so the bose condensation in general may only exist at small doping regime , which can be defined as the `` underdoping '' regime . in fig .",
    "3 , the shaded curve sketches such a region outside the true aflro phase which is in a much narrower region ( dotted curve ) at finite doping .      in the phase - string representation , the operator of superconducting order parameter @xmath214 can be expressed in terms of ( [ emutual ] ) as follows @xmath215 in which @xmath216 this is the basic expression to be used in the following discussion of superconducting condensation .      for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we will focus on the nearest - neighboring pairing with @xmath217 below .",
    "since the whole mean - field phase is built on @xmath218 the electron pairing order parameter g @xmath219 can be written as @xmath220 we see that the spinons are always paired in the present phase , as described by @xmath167 , up to a temperature scale @xmath221 at small doping .",
    "thus , in order to have a real superconducting condensation below a transition temperature @xmath213 , the holon part has to undergo a bose condensation or , strictly speaking in 2d , a superfluid transition in the kosterlitz - thouless sense ( recall that both spinon and holon are _ bosonic _ in the present representation ) .    one may notice that this superconducting condensation picture is somewhat similar to that in the slave - boson mean - filed theory.@xcite but there are two crucial differences .",
    "firstly , the spinon pairing in the present case practically covers the whole superconducting and normal - state regime that we are interested in .",
    "in other words , @xmath168 in the present mean - field theory defines a `` strange '' metal , and the normal - state anomalies of experimental measurements in the cuprates , including the magnetic properties and the transport properties , are all supposed to happen within such a phase .",
    "in contrast , in the slave - boson mean - field approach the fermionic spinon pairing is directly related to the _ gap _ in the spinon spectrum and has to _ disappear _ at a much lower temperature scale beyond which `` strange '' metallic properties presumably _ start _ to show up .",
    "secondly , the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature of holons are believed to be much higher than the real @xmath213 in the cuprates , and thus one has to introduce other mechanism ( e.g. , gauge - field fluctuations@xcite ) to bring down the temperature scale in the slave - boson mean - field approximation . on the other hand",
    ", there is a unique feature in ( [ sc ] ) , namely , the presence of phases like @xmath222 . here",
    "@xmath223 represents a structure of vortices ( anti - vortices ) centered at @xmath224 ( @xmath225 ) spinons . at @xmath169 ,",
    "_ all _ @xmath224 and @xmath225",
    "spinons are paired up at a finite length scale and so are the vortices and anti - vortices in @xmath226 , which implies @xmath227 as long as holons are bose - condensed . at finite temperature , even though the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature for hard - core bosons can be much higher , the `` phase coherence '' in @xmath228 can be more quickly destroyed at a lower temperature due to the dissolution of the vortices and antivortice bindings in @xmath226 after _ free _ spinons appear . here",
    "the argument for @xmath229 is similar to the previous one for @xmath230 which corresponds the disappearance of the long - range af order once holons become mobile in the metallic phase .",
    "this provides us an estimate of the upper limit for the superconducting transition temperature @xmath213 below .",
    "the holon effective hamiltonian @xmath231 in ( [ hh ] ) determines the interaction between holons and those vortices described by @xmath30 .",
    "if free vortices are few , the condensed holons may easily `` screen '' them by forming supercurrent , which will then effectively keep @xmath228 finite .",
    "but if the number of free vortices , or excited spinons , becomes comparable to the number of holons themselves , one expects that the `` screening '' effect collapses and thus @xmath232 .",
    "it predicts that @xmath213 will be basically determined by the spinon energy scale in the following way : @xmath233 where @xmath234 and the left - hand side represent the average number of excited spinons in @xmath235 with the bose - condensed part ( if exists ) excluded . the dashed line in fig .",
    "3 represents the @xmath213 s determined by ( [ tc ] ) in the limit @xmath236 .",
    "this curve may be regarded as represents the `` optimized '' @xmath213 , because with introducing the flux fluctuations , @xmath237 , there is a finite density of states of spinons emerging at lower energy which effectively reduces @xmath213 defined in ( [ tc ] ) . in the `` optimized '' limit of @xmath238 ,",
    "one may further simplify eq.([tc ] ) by only retaining the contribution from the lowest - peak ( which has a degeneracy @xmath239 ) and obtains : @xmath240 where @xmath241 is given by @xmath242 here @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the energies of @xmath83 and @xmath82 , respectively , corresponding to the lowest - energy peak shown in fig . 4 at @xmath206 .",
    "therefore , @xmath213 is indeed determined by the characteristic energy @xmath243 of spinon excitations .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the symmetry of the order parameter @xmath228 .",
    "basically , one needs to compare the relative phase of @xmath228 between @xmath245 and @xmath246 , or the phase change of the quantity @xmath247 in ( [ sc ] ) .",
    "imagine that we move a holon from @xmath245 to @xmath248 via site @xmath249 . at each step",
    "the holon has to exchange positions with a spinon with index @xmath250 at site @xmath251 which leads to an extra phase @xmath252 due to @xmath253 in @xmath254 . even though other spinons outside the path also contribute to , say , @xmath255 , but their effect is canceled out as @xmath256 picks up the same phase change but with opposite sign in @xmath231 .",
    "therefore , in the end @xmath254 acquires a total phase @xmath257 which is just the _ phase string _ on such a path .",
    "its contribution is always _ negative _ on average for a short - ranged af state . assuming that this is the dominant path ,",
    "one then concludes that @xmath228 has to change sign from @xmath245 to @xmath248 , namely , the d - wave symmetry .",
    "if only the nearest - neighbor - site electron pairing is considered , the order parameter in the momentum space can be written in the form @xmath258 .",
    "therefore , the nonrepairable phase string effect and af correlations are directly responsible for the d - wave symmetry of the superconducting condensation in the background of @xmath168 .",
    "the dynamic spin susceptibility function @xmath259 describes the on - site spin dynamics and is derived in appendix as follows @xmath260,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation @xmath261 only runs over those @xmath67 s with @xmath262 ( note that @xmath83 is symmetric under @xmath134 ) .",
    "if there is a bose condensation of spinons , the contribution from the condensed part to @xmath263 may be explicitly sorted out as @xmath264 with @xmath265 where the subscript @xmath266 refers to the @xmath104 state .",
    "based on eq.([chil ] ) , two kinds of mean - field solutions , with and without bose condensation of spinons , will be studied below . without loss of generality",
    ", we consider these two cases at @xmath202 in which the corresponding density of states , @xmath267 , is already shown in fig . 4 for both cases .",
    "let us firstly focus on the lowest peak of @xmath199 shown in fig .",
    "the contribution of such a peak to @xmath268 was previously discussed in ref . and is illustrated in fig . 5 by the lowest sharp peak ( dashed line ) for @xmath206 and the lowest twin peaks ( solid curve ) for @xmath207 , respectively .",
    "one sees two very distinct features here . for the case of @xmath207 , there is a bose condensation contribution at @xmath269 and it leads to a double - peak structure . but in @xmath206 case , the bose condensation is absent and one finds only a single sharp peak at @xmath270 . in other words",
    ", @xmath271 has drastically different characteristics for cases with and without a spinon bose condensation .",
    "the twin - peak splitting may be understood as follows .",
    "the second peak corresponds a pair of spinons excited from the rvb vacuum , while the first peak describes a _ single _ spinon excitation as the other branch of spinon is in the bose - condensate state .",
    "such a lowest - peak basically maps out the lowest peak of the spinon density of states @xmath199 in fig .",
    "4 according to ( [ chilc ] ) , and the second peak in @xmath271 is located at an energy approximately twice larger than the first one .",
    "the latter one will be always around at low temperature no matter whether there is a bose condensation or not .",
    "so there is a distinct behavior of those two peaks at different temperature as shown in ref . , where the weight of the lowest one gradually diminishes as the temperature approaches to @xmath272 .",
    "in contrast , there is only one sharp `` resonance - like '' peak left in the where the bose condensation is absent .",
    "it corresponds to a pair of spinon excitations located at the lowest peak ( @xmath273 ) of @xmath274 in fig .",
    "4 with @xmath238 ( dashed curve ) . note that this is the limit where the flux fluctuating part @xmath275 is totally suppressed such that a real spinon gap is opened up at low - energy as shown in fig .",
    "the location of the `` resonance '' peak , @xmath276 , is slightly lowered in energy as compared to the corresponding ( second ) peak in the twin - peak case at @xmath207 .",
    "the energy scale of this peak ( @xmath277 ) at @xmath236 limit is roughly independent of @xmath178 and thus of @xmath278 .",
    "this is because @xmath178 term only shifts @xmath59 to @xmath85 by a _",
    "constant _ if there is no dispersion in @xmath82 near the lowest ( highest ) peak , which will not affect @xmath83 near the lowest peak as @xmath59 will readjust its value correspondingly .",
    "we have previously discussed the bose condensation of spinons and argued that it exists only in an `` underdoped '' regime .",
    "we have also shown that holons as bosons can experience a bose condensation at @xmath213 , leading to the superconducting condensation .",
    "if the bose condensation temperature for holons is higher than @xmath272 for spinons , i.e. , @xmath279 , the holons will become bose - condensed before spinons do and it will be generally a _ uniform _ state since there is no inhomogeneous spin ordering above @xmath272 .",
    "thus one may have @xmath280 with @xmath281 being much less than in the normal state . in this case",
    ", the bose condensation of spinons can be effectively prevented at lower temperature because a homogeneous @xmath204 generally leads to an opening of a real spinon gap as shown in fig . 4 for @xmath282 .",
    "so to be self - consistent , once @xmath279 , @xmath272 may no longer exist and @xmath213 becomes the only meaningful temperature scale .",
    "furthermore , we have already seen that @xmath213 is also optimized under @xmath283 .",
    "therefore , this region may be properly defined as the `` optimal - doping '' regime in our theory in contrast to the previously defined underdoped regime at @xmath284 .",
    "such an optimal - doping phase is charge homogeneous and the bose condensation of spinons is absent .",
    "it is characterized , below @xmath213 , by the `` resonance - like '' peak emerging in @xmath268 at @xmath276 in fig .",
    "it is in accord with the @xmath285@xmath286 peak found@xcite in the optimally doped @xmath287 below @xmath213 , if one chooses @xmath288@xmath286 here . above @xmath213 ,",
    "the `` resonance '' peak will quickly disappear as the motion of holons becomes incoherent and a different behavior of @xmath30 is involved as discussed in sec .",
    "on the other hand , the underdoping regime with @xmath284 is characterized by a low - energy twin - peak structure in @xmath268 at @xmath289 .",
    "in contrast to the `` optimal - doping '' case , such an energy structure may not be qualitatively changed even when @xmath290 is below @xmath213 , as holons are also expected to be condensed _",
    "inhomogeneously _ in favor of the spinon energy .",
    "a twin - peak feature has been observed recently in the underdoped @xmath291 compound by neutron scattering@xcite in the odd symmetry channel . in the experiment ,",
    "the lowest peak is located near @xmath292@xmath286 and the second one is near @xmath293@xmath286 , indeed about twice bigger in energy .",
    "most recently , in the underdoped @xmath294 , a second energy scale near @xmath295@xmath286 has been also indicated@xcite besides the earlier report of the lower energy peak near @xmath296@xmath286.@xcite it is noted that the energy scales shown in fig .",
    "5 are generally doping dependent , and those energies in @xmath291 are expected to be relatively smaller than the corresponding peaks in @xmath294 .",
    "a word of caution about the comparison with the @xmath297 compound is that the latter is a double - layer system where two adjacent layer coupling is also important .",
    "but we do not expect the double - layer coupling to qualitatively change the above energy structure of @xmath298 in the odd symmetry channel .",
    "we point out that the fluctuating part of the gauge - field @xmath117 usually makes the two adjacent layers difficult to couple together unless there are af spin domains in the charge deficient region where the total @xmath30 is suppressed , as may be the case of phase separation .",
    "but in the uniform phase , with @xmath275 being suppressed below @xmath213 due to the bose condensation of holons , the effective coupling between layers can also be greatly enhanced to gain interlayer - coupling spin energy .",
    "the anderson s confinement - deconfinement phenomenon@xcite may become most prominently in the optimal - doping regime , which needs to be further explored .",
    "5 also shows @xmath268 in the whole energy regime at @xmath299 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath300 ( solid curve ) , respectively . as compared to the @xmath171 curve in the insert ,",
    "a multi - peak structure is present as well at high energies for such a doped case .",
    "for example , if the @xmath285@xmath286 peak in @xmath287 is explained by the lowest peak in the case of @xmath206 , then the theory predicts a second `` resonance '' peak near @xmath301@xmath286 to be found . those high energy peaks in fig .",
    "5 become rather closer in energy especially in the bose condensed case ( solid curve ) which could be very easily smeared out either by the experimental solution ( it may be further complicated by the fact that the momentum - dependence varies drastically among those peaks ) or by the dynamic broadening due to the finite life time of spinons which is beyond the present mean - field treatment .",
    "nevertheless , the multi - peak structure , especially the twin - peak feature at low energy in the spinon bose - condensed case , should become observable by high solution measurement at low temperature as the unique prediction of the present theory .",
    "in this paper , we have approached the doped antiferromagnet from the half - filling side , where the bosonic rvb description is known to be very accurate for the antiferromagnetism . the crucial modification at finite doping comes from the phase string effect induced by doped holes .",
    "for example , doped holes are turned into bosonic holons by such a phase string effect so that both the elementary spin and charge excitations are bosonic .",
    "the bose condensation of spinons in insulating phase and the bose condensation of holons in metallic phase determine the aflro and superconducting phase transitions , respectively .",
    "while the bosonic rvb pairing , representing short - range af correlations , is always present and is the driving force behind the antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , it is the combination with the phase string effect that decides when and where they occur in the phase diagram . for instance",
    ", the bose - condensation of spinons leads to the aflro only in the case that holes are localized . in the metallic phase where holes become mobile",
    ", the aflro will be destroyed by the phase string effect .",
    "but the bose - condensation of spinons may still persist into weakly doped metallic region , leading to an `` underdoping '' metallic phase with charge inhomogeneity ( phase separation ) and pseudo - gap phenomenon .",
    "there still are many theoretical and experimental issues which have not been dealt with in the present paper and are left for further investigation . here we conclude by giving several critical remarks .",
    "the first is about the phase diagram at larger doping .",
    "recall that in our mean - field description , the metallic phases are characterized by two temperature scales : @xmath213 and @xmath272 , and we have argued that @xmath279 determines an `` optimal - doping '' regime at low temperature where @xmath272 is no longer meaningful .",
    "but beyond this regime , there is a possibility that holons may tend to be always bose - condensed even at _ normal state _ in favor of the hopping energy .",
    "if this occurs , the gauge field @xmath29 in @xmath22 may have to be `` expelled '' to the spinon part , leading to a statistics transmutation to turn spinons into _ fermions _ and causing a collapse of the bosonic rvb order parameter at the normal state . in this picture , the normal state in overdoped regime may simply recover the fermionic uniform rvb state.@xcite    the second issue is about the time - reversal symmetry . recall that the sharp peak structure in spinon spectrum below @xmath213 is mathematically similar to a landau level structure in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "one may naturally wonder if some kind of time - reversal symmetry would be apparently broken like in the anyon theories.@xcite below we point out that this is not the case in the present theory .",
    "first of all , it is easy to see that there is no breaking of the time - reversal symmetry in the holon hamiltonian @xmath231 ( [ hh ] ) in which the gauge field @xmath302 . here @xmath41 behaves like a fluctuating gauge field with @xmath303 , and @xmath304 describes a uniform @xmath43-flux per plaquette which does not break the time - reversal symmetry either as a gauge transformation can easily change @xmath43 flux into @xmath305 flux per plaquette . as for the spin part , even though spinons see @xmath30 which breaks the time - reversal symmetry , one should remember that the physical observable quantity is the spin - spin correlation functions like @xmath298 shown in ( [ chil ] ) , which can be easily shown to be invariant under @xmath306 .",
    "lastly , the sharp peak in the spinon spectrum in the uniform phase provides an explanation for the @xmath285@xmath286 peak in the neutron - scattering measurement of @xmath307 `` 90 k '' sample , but it also means a _ real _ gap in the spinon spectrum . from a naive spin - charge separation picture , one would expect the single - electron green s function to be a convolution of spinon and holon propagators and the electron spectrum may also show a finite gap as well in the superconducting state which may be inconsistent with d - wave symmetry .",
    "but we note that in the present spin - charge separation formalism ( [ emutual ] ) , there is an additional phase field @xmath308 representing the phase string effect .",
    "it means that if a `` bare '' hole created by @xmath9 decays into mobile spinon and holon , a nonlocal topological effect will be left behind which could cost a logarithmic - divergent energy . in other words , the phase string effect in 2d case will serve as a confinement force to prevent a newly doped hole from dissolving into elementary excitations .",
    "( of course , internal charge and spin excitations without involving the change of total electron number are still described by the spin - charge separation in the present mean - field theory . ) in fact , even in 1d case , the single - electron green s function looks quite differently from a simple convolution of spinon and holon propagators , and recently suzuura and nagaosa@xcite have discussed the crucial role of the phase string effect in understanding the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy in @xmath309.@xcite our preliminary investigation in 2d indicates that a bare `` hole '' wavepacket injected into the background of the spin - charge separation mean - field state will behave more like a conventional band - structure quasiparticle in a fermi liquid which shows d - wave gap structure when the holons are bose - condensed and pseudo - gap structure when spinons are bose - condensed .",
    "so experiments involving injecting electron or hole into the system like photoemission spectroscopy may no longer provide _ direct _ information of elementary excitations like in the conventional fermi liquid theory , due to the confinement of phase string effect .",
    "we have benefited from helpful discussions with yong - cong chen and t. k. lee , h. f. fong , and p. bourges .",

    "<S> a mean - field treatment of the phase string effect in the @xmath0 model is presented . </S>",
    "<S> such a theory is able to unite the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase at half - filling and metallic phase at finite doping within a single theoretical framework . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the low - temperature occurrence of the af long range ordering ( aflro ) at half - filling and superconducting condensation in metallic phase are all due to bose condensations of spinons and holons , respectively , on the top of a spin background described by bosonic resonating - valence - bond ( rvb ) pairing . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that both spinon and holon here are bosonic objects , as the result of the phase string effect , represents a crucial difference from the conventional slave - boson and slave - fermion approaches . </S>",
    "<S> this theory also allows an underdoped metallic regime where the bose condensation of spinons can still exist . </S>",
    "<S> even though the aflro is gone here , such a regime corresponds to a microscopic charge inhomogeneity with short - ranged spin ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss some characteristic experimental consequences for those different metallic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> a perspective on broader issues based on the phase string theory is also discussed .    </S>",
