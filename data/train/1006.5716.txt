    "caustics of light have been known since ancient times .",
    "the rainbow is a common example of a light caustic that forms when the family of refracted light rays is projected on to the plane of the sky .",
    "another common example is the heart shaped , or nephroid pattern seen on the bottom of a polished coffee cup .",
    "thus caustics of light are regions where the light intensity is very large .",
    "caustics have well defined physical properties .",
    "the light intensity on the inner ( concave ) side of the rainbow varies like the inverse of the square root of distance from the rainbow .",
    "however , when the rainbow is approached from the outside ( convex ) side , the light intensity remains small until the rainbow is reached , at which point it shoots up abruptly .",
    "the coffee cup caustic is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the caustic is the envelope of the family of reflected light rays , i.e. the curve tangent to all members of the family of rays .",
    "there are two qualitatively distinct regions separated by the caustic : one with three rays at each point and the other with one ray at each point .",
    "consider the point @xmath0 .",
    "near this point , the light intensity varies @xmath1 when measured along @xmath2 , and @xmath3 when measured along @xmath4 .",
    "the intensity at the point @xmath5 is double the intensity at the point @xmath6 for small @xmath7 .",
    "near the smooth curve and far from the point @xmath8 , the light intensity only varies in the region with 3 rays at each point , like the inverse square root of the distance from the smooth curve . as long as one is far from the boundary between the two regions , a small change in position results in only a small change in light intensity .",
    "however , close to the boundary , a small change in position leads to a very large change in light intensity .",
    "what we have described are called _",
    "catastrophes_. caustics are made up of sections of catastrophes ( more precisely , we are concerned with the bifurcation set of the catastrophe ) .",
    "the rainbow caustic is a fold catastrophe .",
    "the coffee cup caustic of fig .",
    "1 consists of 2 fold catastrophes that join together forming a cusp catastrophe .",
    "their properties are described by catastrophe theory which is a branch of singularity theory applied to physical phenomena .",
    "light forms caustics because light is nearly collisionless .",
    "dark matter also has this property .",
    "we may thus expect dark matter in galactic halos to form caustics .",
    "dark matter caustics are singularities in physical space in the limit of zero velocity dispersion @xcite . in reality",
    ", the finite velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles cuts off the divergence in the density .",
    "dark matter caustics are then regions of high density .",
    "we may expect a continuous infall of dark matter to form caustics provided ( i ) the particles are collisionless and ( ii ) they have negligible velocity dispersion .    the shells or arcs seen around some giant elliptical galaxies @xcite are caustics in the distribution of stars . when a small galaxy is disrupted , the stars of the small galaxy fall into the gravitational potential of the giant galaxy",
    "these stars are then sub - virial , i.e. they are cold . being compact , stars are nearly collisionless .",
    "the infall of cold collisionless stars leads to the formation of caustics at the turnaround radii .",
    "the observations of caustics of stars strongly suggests the existence of caustics of dark matter due to the infall of cold , collisionless particles . these are called _",
    "outer caustics _ and appear as a series of thin spherical shells surrounding galaxies .    besides the outer caustics , the infall of dark matter particles results in _",
    "inner caustics_. when the particles possess angular momentum , they do not pass through the center , and hence have non - zero inner turnaround radii .",
    "inner caustics form near these locations .",
    "2 shows the dark matter trajectories for the case of ( a ) radial infall and ( b ) infall with angular momentum .",
    "when the trajectories are exactly radial , the infall forms a point singularity at the center .",
    "when a small amount of angular momentum is added to the flow , the result is a caustic made up of sections of catastrophes .",
    "further small perturbations do not change the qualitative nature of the inner caustic in ( b ) .",
    "the inner caustics are made up of folds and cusps which may terminate on higher order catastrophes .",
    "the formation of inner caustics is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the caustic of fig .",
    "2(b ) resembles the coffee cup caustic of fig .",
    "1 . the spherical shell caustics mentioned earlier qualitatively resemble the rainbow caustic .",
    "one may ask whether substructure in real galactic halos can greatly increase the number of flows and weaken the caustics . in @xcite , it was shown that each substructure clump can break up a flow into 3 sub - flows , called `` daughter flows '' .",
    "downstream of @xmath9 clumps , the number of sub - flows @xmath10 can be very large for moderately large @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however this does not destroy the discreteness of the phase space hypersurface because the density of the main flow is not equally divided among the sub - flows .",
    "let us consider the very first flow , i.e. dark matter particles falling towards the halo center for the first time .",
    "the first turnaround marks the radius at which particles bound to the halo decouple from the hubble expansion .",
    "a caustic does not form at the first turnaround radius since there is only one flow there .",
    "the first outer caustic occurs at the _ second _ outer turnaround radius .",
    "the first inner caustic occurs at the _ first _ inner turnaround radius .",
    "we thus see that the first inner caustic forms before the first outer caustic . as an example , let us assume that the first flow contributes @xmath11 to the local dark matter density in the absence of gravitational scattering by substructure .",
    "let us assume there is enough substructure to break up the first flow into a large number , say @xmath12 of sub - flows .",
    "let us also ( incorrectly ) assume that the density is equally divided among the sub - flows .",
    "we then have @xmath12 flows , each contributing @xmath13 to the local dark matter density , and each producing an inner caustic of no realistic importance near the inner turnaround radii .",
    "the flows eventually fall out of the potential well ( i.e. their radial velocities becomes positive ) , and form @xmath12 outer caustics , of negligible density contrast at the outer turnaround radii .",
    "the conclusion then would be that there are _ no _ physically relevant caustics , inner or outer .",
    "this conclusion contradicts the observations of @xcite who have obtained evidence for the existence of a dark matter outer caustic in their study of galaxies in the group around ngc 5846 , and have interpreted the caustic as that of second turnaround , i.e. the first outer caustic .",
    "this result has been interpreted by @xcite as evidence that an inner caustic exists in that group .",
    "indeed it is hard to understand how the first outer caustic can form if the infalling flow is so diffused that it can not produce the first inner caustic . in @xcite",
    ", it was found that gravitational scattering of dark matter particles by inhomogeneities does not greatly affect the first few flows unless most of the dark matter is composed of very massive ( @xmath14 ) clumps .",
    "we know of no evidence that the dark matter in the milky way is composed of such massive clumps . on the contrary ,",
    "the recent findings of @xcite show that @xmath15 of the dark matter in halos is accounted for by smooth accretion of particles not bound in halos .    assuming a continuous infall of cold dark matter particles with angular momentum ( assumed aligned with the baryon angular momentum ) , one may expect to find a series of inner caustics in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "authors @xcite ( motivated by the work of @xcite ) have proposed a model of the milky way halo that predicts the locations of the caustics , and the approximate density near the caustics . in this model",
    ", the earth naturally lies between two inner caustics .",
    "the distance to the nearest inner caustic has been estimated in @xcite .",
    "a ring like feature in the cluster cl 0024 + 1654 was studied by @xcite who have interpreted the feature as a dark matter inner caustic .",
    "the presence of inner caustics in spiral galaxies was investigated by @xcite , who found possible evidence for their existence by analyzing the rotation curves of many galaxies .",
    "rises in the rotation curve of the milky way also show possible evidence for the existence of caustics in our galaxy @xcite . in @xcite , the presence of a triangular feature in the infrared spectrum",
    "was proposed as possible evidence for the presence of a nearby inner caustic .",
    "certain high resolution simulations see cold streams @xcite that are associated with inner caustics",
    ". however , recent n - body simulations performed by @xcite do not find significant inner caustics .",
    "the absence of inner caustics in these simulations is inconsistent with the predictions of @xcite and with the claimed observational evidence . in this article , we do not attempt to reconcile the simulations with the observations .",
    "instead we suggest that a nearby dark matter caustic may be revealed by the velocity distribution of dark matter particles in the solar neighborhood .",
    "if there exists a nearby dark matter inner caustic , the dark matter velocity distribution is influenced by the cold flow forming the caustic .",
    "we show that the annual modulation expected in the recoil rate measured by a detector can be used to detect the presence of a nearby inner caustic , even for weak density enhancements .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the continuous infall of cold collisionless matter necessarily produces an inner caustic .",
    "let us review the argument : consider a sphere with a conveniently chosen radius , such that all particles of a given flow pass through the sphere .",
    "then , we may identify every particle of the flow by 3 parameters @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the time when the particle crossed the sphere on its way in to the halo . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are co - ordinates on the sphere .",
    "let @xmath20 be a location in physical space where the dark matter density is measured .",
    "a catastrophe forms at points where the mapping from the space @xmath16 to the space @xmath21 is singular .",
    "the condition for the mapping to be singular at @xmath21 is the vanishing of the jacobian determinant : d = det = ( ) = 0 .",
    "[ caustic_condition ] let @xmath22 be the point on the reference sphere where the angular momentum is a maximum ( the angular momentum field defined on a sphere has a maximum somewhere unless it is zero everywhere ) .",
    "let us choose @xmath23 to be the point of closest approach of the particles with the most angular momentum , and let us define @xmath24 .",
    "then we have at @xmath25 : = x = 0 = x = 0 = x = 0 .",
    "the first condition is due to the reversal of the sign of the radial velocity at @xmath25 .",
    "the other two conditions are due to the angular momentum maximum at @xmath22 .",
    "since the four vectors @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 can not all be mutually perpendicular at the same point , at least two of the vectors are linearly dependent , or at least one of them is zero .",
    "this satisfies the caustic condition eq .",
    "[ caustic_condition ] .",
    "thus the infall of a cold , collisionless shell of particles necessarily results in the formation of an inner caustic , regardless of assumptions of symmetry .    the structure of the inner caustic depends on the spatial distribution of angular momentum on the initial reference sphere . for purely curl like initial conditions ,",
    "the inner caustic resembles a ring , made up of sections of the elliptic umbilic catastrophe @xcite . for purely gradient like initial conditions , the inner caustic has a more complicated shape and is made up of sections of the hyperbolic umbilic catastrophe @xcite .",
    "for the special case of axial symmetry with gradient like initial conditions , one may find swallowtail and butterfly catastrophes @xcite .",
    "dark matter caustics can affect the distribution of stars in the galaxy . in @xcite",
    ", it was proposed that the monoceros ring of stars may have formed due to the the presence of the @xmath30 inner caustic of the milky way .",
    "two mechanisms were found by which the star density could be enhanced in the vicinity of an inner caustic , and these may have played a role in the formation of the monoceros ring .",
    "authors @xcite examined the possibility of observing caustics by gravitational lensing , while @xcite have studied dark matter annihilation in caustics .",
    "these possibilities however require high densities in the vicinity of the caustic .",
    "let us now review the annual modulation expected in the recoil rate of a detector , and show that it is an excellent probe of a nearby dark matter caustic even when the density enhancement due to caustic is low .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that due to the motion of the earth about the sun , the flux of dark matter particles reaching the earth is modulated with a period of 1 year , and is largest at certain times of the year .",
    "dama is a dark matter direct detection experiment that measures the annual modulation in the recoil rate , and claims a positive result with @xmath31 confidence @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it seems the results obtained by dama are incompatible with the null results of other experiments ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the idea of using the annual modulation as a probe of a nearby dark matter caustic is not new .",
    "authors @xcite have calculated the expected recoil rate for the late infall self similar caustic model . the effect of cold streams has been studied by several authors ( see for example @xcite ) . here",
    "we review the known results , and study the case of a maxwellian velocity distribution modified by a single cold flow due to the presence of a nearby caustic .",
    "we present results for two cases ( i ) when the stream contributes significantly to the dark matter density ( i.e. caustic with a large density boost ) and ( ii ) when the stream is a small perturbation .",

    "we considered the case of a maxwellian velocity distribution modified by a cold flow due to the nearby caustic in the self - similar infall model .",
    "3 shows the velocities of the two flows that contribute to the formation of the nearest caustic .",
    "4 shows the mean inverse speed @xmath51 expected for a cold flow , for a maxwellian distribution , and for a combination of the two .",
    "we then computed the recoil rate integrated over energies in 5 kev bins .",
    "we considered two cases : ( i ) a 50% contribution due to the caustic flow ( fig .",
    "5 ) and ( ii ) a 5% contribution ( fig 6 ) .",
    "we showed that the phase of the annual modulation at low energies can be used to constrain the wimp mass only if the velocity distribution of dark matter particles in the solar neighborhood is known .",
    "we also showed that even a small contribution by a caustic flow can significantly alter the modulation of the recoil rate , at energies near the threshold energy of the caustic flow .",
    "annual modulation is thus an excellent tool to detect a nearby dark matter caustic ."
