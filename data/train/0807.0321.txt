    "the transition from coloured quarks and gluons to colourless hadrons  the so - called fragmentation or hadronization process  is a quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) phenomenon with many important theoretical and phenomenological implications for the physics at high - energy colliders ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "@xmath1 the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) @xmath2 of the final - state partons @xmath3 obey evolution equations given by @xmath4 where the summation over @xmath5 is understood .",
    "@xmath6 is a time - like hard scale such as the squared four - momentum of the gauge boson in the reaction @xmath7 .",
    "the ffs are a basic ingredient at colliders , e.g. , in the cross sections for particle production at high transverse momenta . however , being non - perturbative quantities , the @xmath8 have to be determined from global analyses ( fits ) of various experimental hadron and photon production data , if possible including flavour identification .",
    "the available high - precision results for the ffs constrain and , eventually , improve the perturbative calculation of hadron and photon production in a way similar to global analyses of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) for the initial protons . with a new kinematical range accessible in proton collisions at lhc energies and at",
    "much increased luminosities , new opportunities for precision determinations of ffs will arise . at the same time , improved evolution equations for the ffs beyond the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) of perturbative qcd will become important .",
    "the scale dependence in eq .",
    "( [ eq : devol ] ) is controlled by the time - like splitting functions @xmath9 which admit an expansion in powers of the strong coupling @xmath10 , @xmath11 where we normalize the expansion parameter as @xmath12 .",

    "the leading - order ( lo ) terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ptexp ] ) are identical to the space - like case of the initial - state pdfs , a fact often referred to as the gribov - lipatov relation @xcite .",
    "also the next - to - leading order contributions @xmath22 have been known for long  @xcite and shown to be related to their space - like counter - parts by a suitable analytic continuation  @xcite .    following these ideas ,",
    "we have derived all three - loop non - singlet functions corresponding to @xmath15 and the diagonal singlet quantities @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the space - like nnlo results computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . to that end , we have applied two independent methods .",
    "one approach relied on mass factorization , knowledge of the infrared singularities and an analytic continuation in the momentum fraction from @xmath0 to @xmath25 .",
    "the other approach implemented the concept of universal ( kinematics independent ) splitting functions of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first method started from the unrenormalized partonic structure functions in deep - inelastic scattering ( dis )  @xcite in dimensional regularization .",
    "after iteratively subtracting virtual contributions due to the quark or gluon form factors  @xcite ( which are well known also in the time - like region ) we applied an analytic continuation to the @xmath0-dependent real - emission functions @xmath26 from @xmath0 to @xmath25 at each order in @xmath27 similar to refs .",
    "@xcite . during this step",
    "we have also taken into account the ( complex ) continuation of the dis scale @xmath28 and the additional @xmath29-dimensional prefactor @xmath30 originating from the phase space of the detected parton in the time - like case ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the subtle point in all",
    "this is the treatment of logarithmic singularities for @xmath31 starting with @xmath32    these steps lead to the ( unrenormalized ) one - parton inclusive fragmentation function in time - like kinematics , which can be re - assembled order by order in @xmath27 , keeping the real parts of the continued functions @xmath33 only .",
    "finally the time - like splitting functions ( and coefficient functions ) can be extracted iteratively from the mass factorization relations .",
    "up to two loops all these the steps have been checked by a direct calculation for one - parton inclusive electron - positron annihilation  @xcite .    at three loops we have several consistency conditions , for instance the cancellation of all higher poles in dimensional regularization .",
    "most importantly , sum rules exist for the first moment of @xmath34 ( number of fermions ) and the second moment of @xmath24 at @xmath35 ( momentum in pure gluodynamics ) .",
    "these indicate different coefficients for the terms @xmath36 of @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath39 , where @xmath40 are proportional to the lo splitting functions .",
    "such differences are not unexpected in view of the imperfect real - virtual separation at three loops in the approach described above .    as an independent confirmation of our analytic continuation approach including the sum - rule fix we thus needed a second , completely independent method . for this purpose",
    "we have adopted the relations between dis and fragmentation processes of ref .",
    "@xcite which exploit ideas of universal , i.e. , kinematics independent parton - parton splittings based on a physical picture of strongly ordered life - times of successive parton fluctuations . introducing universal ( non - singlet ) splitting functions @xmath41 , postulated to be identical for the time - like and space - like cases , eq .",
    "( [ eq : devol ] ) can be represented in the following manner  @xcite @xmath42 where the notation covers both the ( time - like @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) ffs and the ( space - like  @xmath43 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) pdfs .",
    "an additional shift in the argument of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmsevol ] ) also included in  @xcite is irrelevant for our discussion .",
    "the @xmath10-expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmsevol ] ) correctly accounts for the nlo difference @xmath47 between the space- and time - like splitting functions @xcite . at nnlo",
    "it leads to the remarkably compact expression @xmath48                 \\otimes p_{\\rm ns}^{\\,(0 ) }              + \\big [ \\ln x \\cdot p_{\\rm ns}^{\\,(0 ) } \\big ]                \\otimes \\widetilde{p}_{\\rm ns,\\ , \\xi}^{\\,(1 ) } \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 , the mellin convolution is again denoted by @xmath19 , and @xmath50 the evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp2dms ] ) exactly coincides with the result of the above analytic continuation including the correct coefficient for the term @xmath51 of @xmath52 , as the required vanishing first moment is manifest in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp2dms ] ) .",
    "this result provides both the desired confirmation of the analytic continuation and strong evidence in support of the ansatz  ( [ eq : dmsevol ] ) .    the physical picture leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmsevol ] ) assuming strong ordering in the life - times of successive parton fluctuations can be applied in complete analogy to the case of gluodynamics .",
    "hence a relation similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : dp2dms ] ) can be derived for the space- and time - like difference of the gluon - gluon splitting function @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , this reasoning again solves the above mentioned problem with the term @xmath54 of @xmath24 , automatically yielding the correct coefficient in agreement with the momentum sum rule for @xmath35 .",
    "moreover both methods , the ansatz  ( [ eq : dmsevol ] ) and the analytic continuation , agree for all remaining terms proportional to @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( i.e. , those not involving gluon emission from quarks ) .",
    "the analysis of the large- and small-@xmath0 limits of the time - like splitting functions displays a number of interesting features . the large-@xmath0 behavior of the diagonal quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 is identical to that of their space - like counter - parts up to the sign of the sub - leading @xmath60 contribution as predicted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the small-@xmath0 behaviour in the time - like region is markedly different as , e.g. , @xmath61 receives double - logarithmic contributions ( up to @xmath62 ) with large coefficients . despite large cancellations between leading and subleading terms , both singlet quantities @xmath63 and",
    "@xmath64 show a huge enhancement already at values of @xmath65 , see the plots in ref .",
    "although the ffs for final state hadrons generally do sample regions of larger @xmath0 than the corresponding pdfs for initial protons , it will be very interesting to investigate the range of perturbative stability in @xmath0 once the nnlo time - like splitting functions are known completely .",
    "we have briefly summarized the current knowledge on the time - like splitting functions in massless perturbative qcd . to nlo , the complete set of functions for the evolution kernel in eq .",
    "( [ eq : devol ] ) has been known for a long time @xcite . at nnlo accuracy",
    ", progress has been made by relating space - like and time - like deep - inelastic processes .",
    "presently only the off - diagonal quantities @xmath66 and @xmath67 are still not completely known as a ` naive ' analytic continuation fails , unlike at two loops , for the @xmath68 contributions .",
    "access to these functions hence requires an extension of the methods employed so far , either by extending the concept of universal splitting functions @xcite beyond non - singlet quantities or by refining the technique based on mass factorization and analytic continuation  @xcite . in particular the latter approach also offers other applications , e.g. , to higgs decay mediated through top - quarks as in ref .",
    "@xcite where highly non - trivial three - loop results of ref .",
    "@xcite were successfully confirmed in this manner .",
    "thus any progress on the method of analytic continuation beyond the state of the art presented here may have far reaching applications .",
