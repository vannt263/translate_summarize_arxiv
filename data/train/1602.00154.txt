    "for more than three decades , the intrinsic quark content of the nucleon has been a subject of interest in many studies in hadron physics .",
    "the existence of a nonperturbative quark component in the nucleon that is natural in the light - cone fock space picture was suggested by brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps ) @xcite for the first time . according to the bhps model",
    ", there are two distinct types of quark contributions to the nucleon sea : `` extrinsic '' sea quarks that are produced perturbatively in the splitting of gluons into @xmath2 pairs in the dglap @xmath3 evolution @xcite and `` intrinsic '' sea quarks that are originated through the nonperturbative fluctuations of the nucleon state to five - quark states or a meson plus baryon state .",
    "one of the main differences between extrinsic and intrinsic sea quarks is that they have different treatments ( `` sealike '' and valencelike  respectively ) and then dominate in different regions of momentum fraction @xmath1 .",
    "one can perhaps divide all of the studies that have been performed so far in the intrinsic quark subject into two main categories : heavy and light intrinsic quarks .",
    "both categories contain theoretical calculations from the various light - cone models , extraction of the probabilities of the intrinsic quarks in the nucleon using available experimental data , and impact of intrinsic quarks on the physical observables sensitive to their distributions .",
    "for example , in addition to the bhps result for the intrinsic charm ( ic ) distributions in the nucleon , there have been some other theoretical calculations using the scalar five - quark and meson - baryon models performed by pumplin @xcite and hobbs _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in recent years . in the case of intrinsic light quark distributions ,",
    "some calculations have been performed by chang and pang @xcite using the bhps model and there are also a wide range of results from the meson cloud model ( mcm ) @xcite and chiral quark model ( cqm ) @xcite for either polarized or unpolarized distributions . for the extraction of the probabilities of the intrinsic charm quark in the nucleon , we can point to the analyses performed by bhps @xcite using diffractive production of charmed hadrons ; by harris _",
    "_ @xcite using the emc charm production data @xcite ; and also some global analyses of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) performed so far , including the intrinsic charm contributions in the nucleon @xcite .",
    "moreover , some analyses have been done to extract the probabilities of the light intrinsic quarks @xcite using the existing @xmath4 data from the fermilab e866 drell - yan experiment @xcite and @xmath5 data from the hermes collaboration measurement of charged kaon production in the semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) reaction @xcite .",
    "there have also been some studies about the impact of the intrinsic charm quark on processes such as direct photon @xcite and @xmath6 boson @xcite production in association with a heavy quark or intrinsic bottom quark on heavy new physics @xcite at the present hadron colliders such as lhc .",
    "although the heavy quarks have an important role in the study of many processes in the standard model and beyond it , one of the significant aspects of the nucleon structure is the distribution of strange and antistrange sea quarks and their possible asymmetry .",
    "more precise knowledge in this field is very important for better understanding of the nucleon structure and properties of the sea quarks and also for describing processes such as @xmath7 boson production in association with charm jets @xcite or a single top quark production @xcite , as well as neutrino interactions @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we concentrate on the intrinsic strange quark and calculate its distribution in the nucleon using various light - cone models . actually , in addition to using the bhps model as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite , we use the scalar five - quark model and a simple meson - baryon model ( mbm ) introduced by pumplin @xcite ( and applied for the intrinsic charm ) to calculate the intrinsic strange distribution in the nucleon numerically and then compare the obtained results with each other .",
    "these models can lead to the rather different distributions for the intrinsic strange that can be dominated in different values of @xmath1 .",
    "although the bhps and scalar five - quark models can not give us any asymmetry between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions in the nucleon , the mbm leads to the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "this is a very important conclusion because the perturbative ( extrinsic ) sea quark distributions in the nucleon are clearly symmetric , so the flavor asymmetry observed in the nucleon strange sea @xcite certainly has a nonperturbative origin .",
    "on the other hand , this asymmetry can also be very important for explaining some experimental results such as the nutev anomaly reported by the nutev collaboration @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath0 asymmetry can result also from the chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "the content of the present paper goes as follows : we describe briefly the light - cone picture of the nucleon and review the bhps and scalar five - quark models in sec .",
    "then we present and compare the obtained numerical results for the intrinsic strange distribution using these models at the end of this section .",
    "a simple meson - baryon model used by pumplin to calculate the intrinsic charm distributions @xcite is introduced in sec .",
    "[ mbm ] and is used to calculate the intrinsic strange distributions .",
    "the calculations are done for two states @xmath10 and @xmath11 and the resulting @xmath0 asymmetry from each of these states , and their sums are also presented . in sec .",
    "[ result ] , we discuss the probability of the intrinsic strange in the nucleon and compare the obtained result for the @xmath0 asymmetry from the meson - baryon model presented in sec .  [ mbm ] to the nnpdf @xcite result for this quantity .",
    "we summarize our results and conclusions in sec .",
    "[ summery ] .",
    "a simple parametrization for each model prediction calculated in this work is given in appendix .",
    "the light - cone frame is very useful to understand the internal structure of hadrons that is one of the most interesting subjects of nuclear and particle physics @xcite .",
    "actually , since in the light - cone fock space picture the physical vacuum state has a much simpler structure , the light - cone wave functions provide a perfect description of hadrons that is frame and process independent .    in other words ,",
    "if we define the proton state at fixed light - front time , we find that it is natural to expect nonperturbative intrinsic quark and gluon components in the proton wave function . to be more precise",
    ", we can not consider the proton as a three - quark bound state @xmath12 and its wave function is a superposition of quark and gluon fock states such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , etc . , or in a more dynamical way provided by the meson - baryon models , a superposition of configurations of off - shell physical particles .",
    "as can be seen , one of these states is the five - quark state @xmath14 . although one can find a review in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the next two subsections we present briefly two models that can give us @xmath15 and @xmath16 distributions in the five - quark state @xmath14 .",
    "however , these models can not give us any information about the magnitude of the probability of this state in the proton and it should be estimated in other ways .",
    "we introduce the meson - baryon models in sec .",
    "[ mbm ] separately .",
    "the simplest five - quark model is the bhps model which was proposed in 1980 by brodsky _",
    "_ @xcite . actually , they found that considering a significant @xmath17 fock component in the proton can lead to enhanced production of charmed hadrons and explain their unexpected large production rates at the forward rapidity region . according to the bhps model , for a @xmath18 fock state of the proton where @xmath19 is a heavy quark , neglecting the effect of the transverse momentum in the five - quark transition amplitudes , the momentum distributions of the constituent quarks are given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the mass of the proton and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the mass of quark @xmath24 and momentum fraction carried by it in the five - quark fock state .",
    "the momentum conservation is satisfied by virtue of the delta function .",
    "@xmath25 is the normalization factor and is determined from @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the probability of the @xmath18 fock state in the proton and expected to be roughly proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "integrating eq .   over @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we get the @xmath31 distribution in the proton .    in the case of intrinsic charm ,",
    "bhps considered another simplifying assumption ( in addition to neglecting the effect of the transverse momentum ) that the charm mass is much greater than the nucleon and light quark masses [ @xmath32 . in this way",
    ", the momentum distribution of @xmath33 fock state becomes @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "now , this equation can be solved analytically so that by carrying out all of the integrals except one ( over @xmath36 ) the @xmath37 distribution of the intrinsic charm in the proton is obtained as follows @xmath38 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by performing one more integration over @xmath36 we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "so far , several studies have been done to estimate the magnitude of @xmath40 ( or momentum fraction carried by intrinsic charm ) and have suggested different values for it @xcite . for",
    "a review on the theoretical calculations , constraints from global analyses , and collider observables sensitive to the intrinsic heavy quark distributions , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    as mentioned above , for the case of intrinsic heavy quarks ,",
    "@xmath27 is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "although this dependence is not applicable for the intrinsic light quarks , we expect that the light five - quark states @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 have larger probabilities than the @xmath33 state in the proton . in recent years , chang and pang , generalized the bhps model to the light five - quark states @xcite .",
    "actually , in addition to calculating the intrinsic light quark distributions in the proton , they extracted the probabilities of these states ( @xmath44 ) using available experimental data . since the main purpose of this work is to calculate the intrinsic strange distribution in the proton from the various light - cone models and to compare them with one another , we also calculate the @xmath37 distribution of the intrinsic strange quark in the @xmath45 fock state from the bhps model .",
    "we present the obtained results from the five - quark models at the end of this section .",
    "another light - cone model that can be used to extract the @xmath37 distribution of @xmath19 in the @xmath18 fock state is the scalar five - quark model . in this model that was presented by pumplin @xcite during the study of intrinsic heavy quark probability in the proton ,",
    "the light - cone probability distributions derive directly from feynman diagram rules and some simplifying assumptions that were considered in the bhps model are eliminated . according to the scalar five - quark model , if a point scalar particle with mass @xmath46 and spin @xmath47 couples to @xmath48 scalar particles with masses @xmath49 and",
    "spin @xmath50 by a point - coupling @xmath51 , then the probability distribution @xmath52 can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 although high mass fock states are regulated by the factor @xmath55 in this model , in order to include the effects of the finite size of the proton we should consider further suppression of high - mass states to make the model more realistic and the integrated probability converge . in this regard , we can include the form factor @xmath56 as a function of @xmath8 that characterizes the dynamics of the bound state to suppress the contributions from the high - mass configurations .",
    "pumplin suggested two exponential and power - law forms for wave function factor @xmath57 as follows : @xmath58 ( top ) shows the strange distribution from the bhps model [ eq .  ]",
    "using @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 in gev and also the obtained results from the scalar five - quark model [ eq .  ] using the exponential form factor [ eq .  ] with two values for the parameter @xmath62 ( 2 and 5 ) and the same values for the physical masses . the strange distribution from the scalar five - quark model and using the power - law form factor with @xmath63 and the mentioned values for the physical masses and parameter @xmath62",
    "have been shown in fig .",
    "[ pumpli ] ( bottom ) and compared with the bhps result again . as can be seen from the figures ,",
    "the obtained results from the bhps and scalar five - quark model with the exponential form factor and @xmath64 are very similar , but the result related to the @xmath65 tended to the lower @xmath1 and also is smaller and somewhat greater than the bhps in the regions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "this latter behavior is also seen when we use the scalar five - quark model with the power - law form factor [ eq .  ] and @xmath64 and @xmath68 .",
    "it should be noted that we have neglected the probability of the @xmath69 state in the proton presently and normalized all curves so that the quark number condition @xmath70 is satisfied .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in the light - cone fock space picture , the nucleon s wave function can be considered as a superposition of configurations of off - shell physical particles .",
    "so one of the phenomenological models for producing intrinsic quark distributions is the meson - cloud or meson - baryon model . unlike the five - quark models that lead to an equal distribution for strange and antistrange ,",
    "this more dynamical model can lead to the @xmath0 asymmetry in the nucleon sea .",
    "although the original meson - baryon model is rather complicated computationally @xcite , we can consider a simple configuration as has been used in ref .",
    "according to the mbm , the nucleon can fluctuate to the virtual meson - baryon fock states ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "for example , in the case of intrinsic strange we can consider the two - body state @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is a @xmath74 meson and @xmath75 is a @xmath76 baryon . to calculate the intrinsic @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions in the nucleon , we should model the @xmath72 probability distribution , @xmath76 distribution in @xmath75 , and @xmath74 distribution in @xmath73 and then use the following relation defined as convolutions of the distributions @xcite : @xmath77     baryon , @xmath75 from @xmath78 , and final @xmath8 distribution in the proton ( top ) .",

    "to model the @xmath76 distribution in @xmath75 we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 . moreover , the required physical masses are chosen as @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath59 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in gev .",
    "figure 2 shows the obtained results for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions from @xmath79 using @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as can be seen , the @xmath9 distribution in the @xmath73 meson is harder than the @xmath8 distribution in the @xmath75 baryon . actually , since the fraction of the hadron mass carried by the constituent quark determines the position of the peak of quark distribution in @xmath1 , this difference is because the @xmath9 carries a larger fraction of the @xmath73 mass than the fraction of the @xmath75 mass carried by @xmath8",
    ". maybe we expect the same behavior for the strange and antistrange distributions in the proton .",
    "but in this case the momentum distribution of the meson or baryon in the two - body state @xmath91 also has an important rule .",
    "we see that by doing the convolution of eq .  , the @xmath8 distribution in the proton is somewhat harder than the @xmath9 distribution .",
    "baryon , @xmath75 from @xmath92 , and final @xmath8 distribution in the proton ( top ) .",

    "therefore we can consider only two states , @xmath72 and @xmath99 , that lead to the different shapes for @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions and thus the @xmath0 asymmetry .",
    "we can also sum the results obtained from these states . to calculate @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions from @xmath100",
    ", we use the same physical masses as in the case @xmath72 , but for the antistrange in @xmath93 we take an effective mass @xmath101 to keep @xmath102 and avoid mass singularity .",
    "moreover , the @xmath93 mass is taken to be @xmath103 gev .",
    "the results for @xmath100 are shown in fig .",
    "[ sbarink ] using @xmath104 and @xmath105 again .",
    "since we chose a larger mass for the antistrange quark in the @xmath106 meson than @xmath107 , the resulting @xmath9 distribution is even harder than before .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ sbarink ] that the momentum distribution of @xmath75 and @xmath93 from @xmath100 are peaked almost around @xmath108 , meaning that the meson and baryon approximately share proton momentum fairly equally .",
    "so , because the antistrange quark carries a larger fraction of the total momentum of the meson than the strange quark of the total momentum of the baryon , @xmath9 distribution in the proton is harder and has a greater magnitude than the @xmath8 distribution at large @xmath1 .",
    "as mentioned above , a main difference between the mbm and five - quark models is that the mbm can lead to the @xmath0 asymmetry in the nucleon sea .",
    "actually , since in the mbm framework the probability distributions of the meson and baryon in the proton are different and @xmath8 and @xmath9 also have different distributions in the baryon and meson respectively , the @xmath0 asymmetry is natural .",
    "the possibility of this asymmetry in the nucleon was discussed by signal and thomas @xcite by applying mcm for the first time , and after that it has been investigated by other authors @xcite .",
    "now , having @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions from @xmath79 and @xmath100 , we can calculate strange and antistrange asymmetry for each of these states and also their sum in the proton .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [ 32 ] and labeled as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath109 , respectively . as can be seen , the results from @xmath72 and @xmath99 are quite different .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , several studies have been done so far to estimate the probability of the intrinsic charm in the nucleon ( or momentum fraction carried by intrinsic charm ) and have suggested different values for it .",
    "for example , bhps estimate 1 % probability for intrinsic charm in the proton from the diffractive production of charmed hadrons at large longitudinal momentum @xcite .",
    "however , few analyses have been done to extract the probabilities of the light intrinsic quarks @xcite . in order to calculate the probability of the @xmath69 , chang and pang used the existing @xmath110 data from the hermes collaboration measurement of charged kaon production in a sidis reaction @xcite .",
    "they suggested that these data contain both the extrinsic and intrinsic components of the strange sea that are dominant at small and large @xmath1 , respectively , and also found that data in the @xmath111 region can be described well by the intrinsic strange distributions from the bhps model ( see sec .",
    "[ brodsky ] ) .",
    "they evolved the resulting distributions from the initial scale @xmath112 gev and @xmath113 gev to @xmath114 gev@xmath115 and then extracted the normalization by fitting data with @xmath111 , considering the assumption that the extrinsic sea component is negligible in this region .",
    "the obtained results for the probability of the @xmath69 state are as follows @xcite : @xmath116    as mentioned before , all distributions obtained in the previous sections from the bhps , scalar five - quark , and meson - baryon models have been normalized to 100 % probability so that the quark number condition @xmath70 is satisfied . at this stage , we can take the above - mentioned probability determined using @xmath117 and then evolve @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions from the mbm ( see the previous section ) to calculate the @xmath118 asymmetry at @xmath119 gev@xmath120 , for instance .",

    "<S> precise knowledge of the strange and antistrange quark distributions of the nucleon is a major step toward better understanding of the strong interaction and the nucleon structure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the @xmath0 asymmetry in the nucleon plays an important role in some physical processes involving hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this paper is the study of intrinsic strange contribution to the strange sea of the nucleon . to this aim </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the intrinsic strange distributions from the various light - cone models , including brodsky , hoyer , peterson , and sakai ( bhps ) ; scalar five - quark and meson - baryon models and then compare their results . </S>",
    "<S> these models can lead to the rather different distributions for the intrinsic strange that are dominated in different values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the meson - baryon model leads to the @xmath0 asymmetry that can be comparable in some situations to the result obtained from the global analysis of pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a simple parametrization for each model prediction of intrinsic strange distribution . </S>"
