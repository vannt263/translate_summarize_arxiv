    "one of current challenges of nuclear theory is the quantitative description of nuclei situated near and beyond drip - lines .",
    "powerful facilities are being built in several countries in order to create these very short - lived states . for a long time",
    ", microscopic theories of nuclear structure have been developed for describing ground states of nuclei close to the valley of stability . for describing stable nuclei which are well localized , the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) bases are useful for both shell model @xcite and hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) calculations @xcite",
    "; the ho bases converge quickly therein .",
    "however , it possesses poor convergence properties for weakly bound nuclei bearing large spatial extensions , which lie very close to neutron drip lines .",
    "a promising approach to this problem has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite within a shell model framework ; namely , the gamow shell model ( gsm ) .",
    "the fundamental idea is to replace the ho basis by the berggren basis consisting of bound states , resonance states and continuum scattering states of complex energy , generated by a single - particle potential .",
    "it has been shown numerically that this basis has the ability to expand both halo nuclei and many - body resonant states precisely .",
    "the latter indeed belongs to a rigged hilbert space @xcite , which is an extension of the notion of hilbert space to non - square integrable wave functions .",
    "however , the dimension of the berggren slater determinants represented by the gsm basis increase very quickly with increasing number of valence particles ; it increases much faster than in standard shell model due to the presence of occupied scattering states .",
    "hence , the gsm is a tool mainly dedicated to the study of light nuclei . for medium and heavy nuclei , a method of choice",
    "is the hfb , which can be followed by quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) . as pairing correlations",
    "are absorbed in the hfb ground state , one - body nature of the hfb framework enables fast evaluations of ground states of medium and heavy nuclei , and it is in fact the only method suitable for systematic calculations ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for an evaluation of even - even nuclei in the whole nuclear chart with the hfb formalism . in order to properly treat drip - line nuclei within the hfb framework",
    ", the real - space coordinate - mesh method has been applied using box boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "extension of this approach to deformed nuclei is difficult and has been carried out only recently @xcite . as an alternative more convenient approach",
    ", one can adopt basis expansion methods , where direct integration procedure is replaced by matrix diagonalization .",
    "a first amelioration of the ho basis had been proposed with the transformed harmonic oscillator ( tho ) basis @xcite . applying unitary transformations to the ho basis ,",
    "one obtains the tho basis , in which gaussian fall - off of the ho wave functions is replaced by physical exponential decrease of the tho basis wave functions . however , the tho basis always dictates exponential decrease in expanding quasiparticle wave functions , for both upper and lower components , even when they are part of scattering states , so that unsatisfactory basis dependence remains . in order to solve this problem ,",
    "a new basis has been introduced very recently , which consists in using bound and continuum basis states generated by the analytic pschl - teller - ginocchio ( ptg ) potential  @xcite .",
    "the ptg basis introduced in this paper  @xcite possesses a peculiarity to bear no narrow resonance states ; those are replaced by bound ptg states .",
    "thus , ptg continuum set of basis states can be discretized very effectively with gauss - legendre quadrature , as they contain no resonant structure .",
    "it has been shown that they can provide a good description of spatially extended nuclear ground states of both spherical and axially deformed nuclei  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the ptg basis formed by bound and real scattering states is not a berggren complete set of states , so that it would be more convenient to use a berggren quasiparticle basis set , when we are interested in describing particle - decaying excited states . up to now , however , resonant quasiparticle states have been studied in the context of berggren completeness relation only within the bcs approximation @xcite .",
    "the last approach is indeed not satisfactory due to the well - known gas problem arising from the occupation of the continuum : in fact , densities are not localized in the bcs approach , because the lower components of scattering quasiparticle states are of scattering type as well .",
    "contrary to what is stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , it can not be regularized using complex scaling because it does not have pure outgoing asymptotic .",
    "use of continuum level density in ref .",
    "@xcite is also problematic , even though it suppresses the gas problem .",
    "indeed , it is not part of continuum hfb theory  @xcite , so that its introduction in hfb equations strongly modifies quasiparticle coupling to the continuum .",
    "in particular , it supresses a large part of non - resonant continuum , and thus important physical properties of drip - line nuclei as well . hence , with this approach , weakly bound systems can not be studied properly .",
    "only a full application of the hfb framework can unambiguously solve this problem , where densities are localized by construction for bound hfb ground states .",
    "the major purpose of this paper is to develop a new method of solving the continuum hfb equations utilizing the berggren basis , called gamow - hfb method , by which bound , resonant and continuum quasiparticle states are provided .",
    "it allows expansion of qrpa excited states having escaping widths in terms of the berggren quasiparticle basis associated with the bound hfb ground state .",
    "this is very important because , in weakly bound unstable nuclei , low - lying collective excited states may acquire particle - decay widths .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , the standard hfb formalism is briefly summarized . as we use the skyrme interactions @xcite , it is effected in the context of density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "secondly , we define quasiparticle s - matrix poles and scattering states of complex energy ; these are direct extensions of their single - particle counterparts .",
    "we then present the quasiparticle berggren completeness relation generated by those states .",
    "numerical methods to calculate gamow and complex scattering quasiparticle states are described ; they differ significantly from the scattering quasiparticle states discretized by box boundary conditions .",
    "we also present another method of solving the continuum hfb equations in which the hfb quasiparticle wave functions are expanded in terms of the gamow - hartree - fock ( ghf ) basis ; this approach may be regarded as an extension of the standard two - basis method @xcite to complex energy plane .",
    "feasibility of the proposed methods is illustrated for neutron - rich nickel isotopes close to the drip line .",
    "perspectives for unbound hfb theory and qrpa calculations using the gamow - hfb quasiparticle basis will then be discussed .",
