    "theorists have made considerable progress in explaining the stationary properties of ob star winds , and there is now a consensus that the winds are accelerated through resonance line scattering of the stellar continuum ( lucy &  solomon 1970 ; castor , abbott , &  klein 1975 ) .",
    "the spectral lines predicted by detailed models match observations for a wide variety of ionization species ( pauldrach 1987 ) , and for stars across a range of metallicity and evolutionary status ( kudritzki , pauldrach , &  puls , 1987 ; pauldrach et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "however , it has become clear that real stellar winds are time - variable and contain inhomogeneities which , although expected on theoretical grounds , are difficult for the theory to treat properly . there is independent evidence for these inhomogeneities from the black absorption troughs ( lucy 1982a ) and variable `` discrete absorption features '' seen in wind - formed p  cygni lines ( massa et al .",
    "1995 ) , in the x - ray emission from ob stars ( harnden et al . 1979 ; seward et al . 1979 ; corcoran et al .",
    "1994 ) , and from polarimetric observations ( brown et al . 1995 ) , ir observations ( abbott , telesco , &  wolff 1984 ) and radio observations ( bieging , abbott , &  churchwell 1989 ) . theoretically , the scattering mechanism thought to be responsible for the acceleration of the wind should be unstable , leading to shocks ( macgregor , hartmann , & raymond 1979 ; abbott 1980 ; lucy &  white 1980 ; owocki & rybicki 1984 ) .",
    "although these instabilities have been modelled numerically , the models encounter nonlinearities ( owocki , castor , &  rybicki 1988 )",
    ".    the unknown nature of the wind inhomogeneities has hindered attempts to infer from observations such properties of stellar winds as the mass - loss rates , which are critical for understanding massive star evolution .",
    "the observations are , in essence , averages over the entire nonuniform and time - variable wind , and the unknown weighting of these averages prevents us from knowing the magnitude of the total mass outflow . overcoming these difficulties is a major goal of current studies of hot stellar atmospheres .    when the ob star has an accreting compact companion , x - rays from the compact object can be used as a probe to derive parameters of the undisturbed wind , such as its mass - loss rate , expansion velocity , and radial velocity law . in the `` hatchett - mccray effect '' ( hatchett &  mccray 1977 ;",
    "mccray et al .",
    "1984 ) , the x - rays remove the ion responsible for a p  cygni line from a portion of the wind , resulting in orbital variations of p  cygni profiles .",
    "this effect has been observed in several high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ; dupree et al .",
    "1980 ; hammerschlag - hensberge et al . 1980",
    "; van der klis , et al .",
    "1982 ; kallman &  white 1982 ; haberl , white & kallman 1989 ) .",
    "analysis of the velocities over which the p  cygni lines vary has suggested that in some cases , the stellar wind radial velocity dependence can be nonmonotonic ( kaper , hammerschlag - hensberge , &  van loon 1993 ) . whether this is intrinsic to the ob star wind or is a result of the interaction with the compact object is not known .",
    "lmc  x-4 shows a more pronounced hatchett - mccray effect than any other x - ray binary .",
    "the uv p  cygni lines of at 1240  appear strong in low - resolution iue spectra at @xmath8 , but nearly disappear at @xmath9 ( van der klis et al .",
    "the equivalent width of the absorption varies by more than 100% throughout the orbit , suggesting that the x - ray source may remove from the entire region of the wind outside of the x - ray shadow of the normal star .",
    "if the x - ray ionization of the wind is indeed this thorough , then the change in the p  cygni profile between two closely spaced orbital phases is largely the result of the x - ray shadow of the primary advancing through a thin `` slice '' of the stellar wind .",
    "thus models of the changing p  cygni profiles should be sensitive to a region of the wind that is small in spatial extent .",
    "vrtilek et al .",
    "( 1997 , paper  i ) obtained high - resolution spectra of the lines ( and the @xmath10  lines , which show weaker variability ) with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) aboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "these spectra , unlike the earlier iue spectra , provide a high enough resolution and signal to noise ratio to allow us to examine the detailed velocity structure of the p  cygni lines over closely spaced intervals of the binary orbit .",
    "lmc x-4 consists of a main - sequence o star ( variously classified as o79 iii ",
    "v ) of about @xmath11 and a @xmath12 neutron star with a spin period of 13.5 seconds ( kelley et al . 1983 ) .",
    "pulse delays from the neutron star have established the projected semimajor axis of the orbit precisely as 26  light seconds .",
    "the 1.4  day orbital period is also seen in x - ray eclipses ( li , rappaport , & epstein 1978 ) and modulations of the optical brightness ( heemskerk &  van paradijs 1989 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in the normal state is hard ( photon power - index @xmath13 ) with little absorption of the soft x - rays ( woo et al .",
    "1996 give @xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",
    "the total quiescent x - ray luminosity is @xmath16  erg  s@xmath17 , near the eddington limit for a @xmath18 neutron star .",
    "x - ray flares , in which the pulse - averaged x - ray luminosity can exceed 10@xmath19  erg  s@xmath17 , occur with a frequency of about once a day ( kelley et al . 1983 ; pietsch et al .",
    "1985 ; levine et al . 1991 ) .",
    "these flares have been interpreted as dense blobs of wind material crashing down on the surface of the neutron star ( white , kallman , &  swank 1983 ; haberl , white , &  kallman 1989 ) .",
    "it is an open question whether these blobs represent the natural state of the stellar wind , or are produced by interactions between the x - ray source and an unperturbed stellar wind . an accreting compact object embedded in a stellar wind",
    "can affect the wind through the heating , ionization , and radiation pressure of its x - ray emission , and through its gravity .",
    "numerical simulations ( blondin et al . 1990 , 1991 ) of the modifications of the stellar wind by the compact object show that the wind can form accretion wakes and disk - like structures ( even in systems which are not thought to have substantial mass - transfer through roche lobe overflow ) .",
    "thus an investigation of instabilities in the wind of lmc  x-4 also bears on the cause of the x - ray flares .",
    "we present a series of increasingly more sophisticated models of the p  cygni lines in lmc  x-4 , as observed with the ghrs and reported in paper  i. in  [ sec : compare ] , we compare the and p  cygni lines to those of isolated ob stars and to those of other massive x - ray binaries .",
    "we make inferences from analytic and approximate models to the p  cygni line variations in ",
    "[ sec : simple ] .",
    "then we attempt more detailed models in  [ sec : numeric ] , and derive best - fit parameters for the wind and x - ray luminosity .",
    "we note that this is the first detailed fit of p  cygni lines that has been attempted for a hmxb .",
    "the sophistication of the models that we present is justified by the high quality of the data on this system that should be obtained in the near future .",
    "in this section , we compare the uv line profiles of lmc  x-4 with the line profiles of similar stars .",
    "the strength of the orbital variation in p  cygni lines ( the hatchett - mccray effect ) differs among the hmxb .",
    "figure  1 compares the lines at two orbital phases with the corresponding features in 4u1700 - 37 and vela  x-1 ( the latter two objects were observed with iue at high spectral resolution in the echelle mode ) .",
    "the optical companion of 4u1700 - 37 is very massive ( @xmath20 ) and hot ( spectral type o6.5 with effective temperature 42,000k ; kaper et al .",
    "1993 ) . in this system",
    "the resonance line is saturated and shows little or no variation over orbital phase ; this saturation is caused by the very strong stellar wind produced by the extremely massive and hot companion .",
    "the companion of vela  x-1 has a lower mass ( 23@xmath21 ) and is considerably cooler ( spectral type b0.5 with an effective temperature of 25,000k ; kaper et al .",
    "the wind in lmc  x-4 is expected to be weaker than in vela x-1 and 4u1700 - 37 , as the optical companion is not a supergiant .",
    "as the abundances of metals are lower in the lmc than in the galaxy , lower mass - loss rates for a given spectral type are expected .",
    "the low abundances will also make the lines less saturated and the effects of x - ray ionization more visible .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of lmc  x-4 is the highest of the three systems . as a result of these considerations , it is not surprising that the effects of x - ray ionization on the lines are strongest in lmc  x-4 .",
    "for all three systems the resonance lines show little orbital variation during the phases observed .",
    "the effects of the x - ray photoionization on the blueshifted p  cygni absorption are greatest for lmc  x-4 near @xmath9 .",
    "the observed line profiles still show residual absorption at @xmath23 .",
    "paper  i interpreted this absorption to be the photospheric doublet , which is masked by the wind absorption during x - ray eclipse . if this interpretation is correct , the width of the absorption is determined by the rotation of the normal star , not the wind expansion velocity .",
    "alternately , at the base of the wind where the expansion velocity is low , the wind may be dense enough that can still exist even in the presence of x - ray illumination .",
    "nearly all early - type stars whose photospheric absorption lines could be usefully compared with those of lmc  x-4 also have strong wind absorption .",
    "the o9  iv star @xmath24col ( hd  38666 ) seems to be a promising candidate for comparison , as its line has negligible red - shifted emission , and the blue - shifted absorption is confined to features near the rest wavelength .",
    "although this is the best candidate for the intrinsic photospheric absorption spectrum that we were able to obtain , wollaert , lamers , &  de jager ( 1988 ) suggest that the and lines in this star are wind - formed because they are asymmetric .",
    "we have compared iue and hst spectra of @xmath24col with our spectra of lmc  x-4 , and although the detailed fit is poor ( figure  2a ) , the strength of the absorption in @xmath24col is comparable to the absorption in lmc  x-4 at @xmath25 .",
    "this provides qualified support that the photospheric lines of subgiant o stars can be comparable to the lines we see in lmc  x-4 .",
    "we also compare the lmc  x-4 spectra with the optical absorption lines which hutchings et al .",
    "( 1978 ) concluded were photospheric .",
    "hutchings et al",
    ". found that the optical lines were consistent with an orbital velocity of @xmath26  km  s@xmath17 and a systemic velocity of @xmath27  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "they measured the width of the optical lines to be @xmath28  km  s@xmath17 , which would be expected if the primary rotates with a period twice as long as the binary orbit .",
    "we find a good fit to the absorption profile using gaussians with width ( approximately equal to @xmath29 width ) 170  km  s@xmath17 and optical depths @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the blue and red components ( figure  2b ) .    while the absorption velocity agrees with both the optical absorption line velocity found by hutchings et al . and with the systemic velocity of the lmc ( bomans et al .",
    "1996 ) , the cross - over between absorption and emission occurs at relative red - shifts of @xmath32  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "this may suggest that lmc  x-4 has a red - shift relative to the lmc and that the `` photospheric '' absorption is actually blue - shifted p  cygni absorption .    in the absence of a clear means of separating the wind and photospheric absorption ,",
    "we will allow , in the more detailed analysis that follows , the strength of a photospheric absorption line to be an adjustable free parameter .",
    "we note that groenewegen &  lamers ( 1989 ) fit p  cygni lines observed with iue , and that for the stars hd  24912 , 36861 , 47839 , and 101413 ( with spectral types o7.5iii ,",
    "o8iii , o7v , and o8v respectively ) , the best - fit values of @xmath33 for are 0.0 , 0.4 , 0.3 , and 0.3 respectively .",
    "in the discussion that follows , we assume that the orbital variation of the p  cygni lines is caused principally by the hatchett - mccray effect , that is , through the photoionization of the stellar wind by the x - ray source",
    ". there do not appear to be any variable raman - scattered emission lines which kaper et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested cause an orbital variability in the x - ray binary 4u  1700 - 37 .      following van der klis et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , we examine the orbital variation of the equivalent width of in lmc  x-4 using a simple numeric model .",
    "hatchett &  mccray ( 1977 ) showed that the x - ray ionized zones could be approximated as surfaces of constant @xmath34 , where each point in the wind has a value of @xmath34 given by @xmath35 here , @xmath36 is the x - ray luminosity , @xmath37 is the electron density at the radius of the x - ray source ( @xmath38 stellar radii in the case of lmc  x-4 ) , and @xmath39 is the ionization parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the electron density at the given point , and @xmath42 is the distance from that point to the x - ray source . given a constant mass - loss rate @xmath7 for the wind , @xmath41 can be found from mass conservation : @xmath43 we illustrate these parameters in figure  3 .    for large values of @xmath34 ,",
    "the surfaces of constant ionization are spheres surrounding the x - ray source , while for @xmath44 , the surfaces are open .",
    "where the surfaces extend into the primary s x - ray shadow , a conical shape must be used instead of the constant @xmath34 surface .",
    "we model the absorption line variation using the velocity law @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the wind radial distance in units of the stellar radius .",
    "according to van der klis et al .",
    "the results are not sensitive to the velocity law assumed",
    ". we account for the orbital inclination @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , pietsch et al .",
    "1985 ) by using a corrected orbital phase @xmath49 such that @xmath50 . to model the orbital variation of equivalent width",
    ", we used the best - fit escape probability model we describe in  [ sec : basic ] , except that the only x - ray ionization occurs within the zone bounded by @xmath34 , which is completely ionized .",
    "we measured the equivalent width of , , and for all the iue observations of lmc  x-4 ( using the final archive version of the data , which has been processed by newsips , the new spectral image processing system , de la pena et al .",
    "we used the ephemeris of woo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to find the corresponding orbital phases for each spectrum . in figure  4",
    ", we compare theoretical variations in equivalent width with those observed with iue and the ghrs .",
    "that is , we plot @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the equivalent width , and @xmath53 is the average value of @xmath52 . here , @xmath52",
    "measures only the equivalent width of the absorption , and not the p  cygni emission .",
    "as the ghrs spectra were obtained during less than a complete binary orbit , we use the average equivalent width from the iue observations to find the per cent variation in equivalent width for the ghrs spectra as well .",
    "the results shown in figure  4 are consistent with @xmath54 , in which case the x - ray source photoionizes at least the entire hemisphere opposite the primary , and possibly as much as the entire wind outside of the primary s shadow .",
    "the fit to the iue data is better for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) than for full x - ray photoionization ( @xmath57 ) , although the ghrs equivalent widths agree with the prediction of full ionization .",
    "we note that interstellar and photospheric absorption lines , if present , provide additional absorption components that are not expected to show strong orbital variation . if these components are present , this would naturally explain why the fractional variation in equivalent width that we see is less than that predicted by @xmath58 .",
    "for example , for , @xmath59 , while @xmath52 due to photospheric absorption was found with the ghrs to be @xmath60 . without consideration of the photospheric absorption ,",
    "the observed variation of 1.6   corresponds to @xmath61% .",
    "however , this corresponds to a 100%  variation in the equivalent width of absorption due to the wind alone , excluding the photospheric absorption .",
    "it is likely that figure  4 underestimates the per cent variation of the p  cygni absorption for the and lines , as x - ray should be _ more _ effective in removing these ions from the wind than removing from the wind . a systematic uncertainty in choosing the continuum level will have a greater effect on the fractional variation in the equivalent width of the weaker lines , such as .",
    "in the next section , we will make the simplifying assumption that the entire region outside the conical shadow of the normal star is ionized by the x - ray source , and from this derive the radial velocity law .",
    "the spectra obtained with the ghrs were read out at 0.5 second intervals , using its rapid mode ( paper  i ) .",
    "the p  cygni absorption profile was variabile on time scales shorter than the hst orbit .",
    "we interpret this as the result of the x - ray shadow of the primary crossing the cylinder subtending the face of the primary , where the blue - shifted absorption is produced .",
    "we attempt to infer the radial velocity law in the wind from this rapid p  cygni variation and a few simple assumptions .",
    "we assume here that x - ray photoionization removes and from the entire wind outside of the x - ray shadow of the primary .",
    "this assumption is easily shown to be reasonable , based not only on the iue and hst equivalent width variations (  [ sec : iue ] ) but also on the expected value of @xmath34 . given a mass - loss rate of 10@xmath62  yr@xmath17 , a velocity at the x - ray source of 600  km  s@xmath17 , and an ionization parameter @xmath63 at which there should be little present ( kallman &  mccray 1982 ) , we find @xmath64 .",
    "as buff &  mccray ( 1974 ) pointed out , as an x - ray source orbits a star with a strong stellar wind , the absorbing column to the x - ray source should vary in a predictable way that depends on the wind structure and the orbital inclination .",
    "if the wind is not photoionized , then the absorbing column increases near eclipse . in a companion paper ( boroson et al .",
    "1999 ) we will examine the ionization in the wind from the variation in the absorbing column as seen with asca .",
    "preliminary analysis supports @xmath58 .",
    "we now use the geometry shown in figure  5 .",
    "the primary star is assumed to be spherical with a radius @xmath65 .",
    "the neutron star orbits at a radius @xmath66 .",
    "the angle between the ray connecting the neutron star to the center of the primary and a tangent to the primary s surface is given by @xmath67 .",
    "then we define three relevant distances : @xmath68    we wish to compute , given @xmath69 , the radius @xmath70 in the wind responsible for the maximum observed velocity of absorption .",
    "given @xmath71 derived from closely spaced @xmath69 when the shadow of the primary is moving across the line of sight , we can compare with the theoretical expectation of the wind acceleration velocity law .",
    "( note that this assumes a spherically symmetric wind . )",
    "given a monotonic velocity law , in most situations the maximum absorption velocity will be observed to be @xmath72 corresponding to a wind radial velocity @xmath73 ( figure  5 ) , at a distance of @xmath74 from the center of the primary .",
    "this is the furthest radial distance at which the wind can absorb stellar continuum and at which the x - rays from the neutron star are shadowed by the limb of the primary .",
    "note that the wind at this point is moving obliquely so that @xmath75 . as @xmath69 increases from 0.1 to 0.5 , the wind at @xmath73 will move with increasing obliqueness to the line of sight . as a result , even though this point has the greatest radial distance of any point in the wind that can absorb , it still may not cause the absorption with the highest possible _ line of sight _ velocity , even in a monotonic wind . as a first check to see",
    "if the obliquity of the velocity vector at @xmath76 is important , we can compare @xmath72 with @xmath77 , which can be calculated from @xmath78 , assuming a radial velocity law .",
    "we assume that @xmath79 , which can be calculated from the mass ratio and the assumption that the primary fills its roche lobe .",
    "( note that we use the separation between the centers of mass of the two stars , and not the distance of the ns from the cm of the system , which is about 10%  smaller . )",
    "we determine the maximum velocity of absorption by fitting the high - velocity edge of the absorption profile with a broken line ( figure  6 ) .",
    "the line is horizontal for the continuum blue - ward of the maximum velocity of absorption and has a nonzero slope , allowed to vary as a free parameter , at velocities less than the maximum .",
    "when the doublets do not overlap ( @xmath80 ) , we are able to obtain two maximum velocities at each phase , one for each doublet component . for the red doublet component",
    ", we do not fit a broken line in order to determine the maximum absorption velocity , as the profile is never horizontal .",
    "instead , we find the maximum absorption velocity in the red doublet component by determining where the flux rises to the continuum level ( which is determined by the broken - line fit to the blue doublet component . )",
    "the results from the red and blue doublet components do not show a systematic difference .",
    "thus averaging maximum absorption velocities determined in each line allows us to reduce the errors in our velocity measurements .",
    "we can apply a further refinement to the method .",
    "the observed p  cygni trough is actually a sum of the true absorption profile and blue - shifted p  cygni emission .",
    "the observed maximum absorption velocity may be shifted by the addition of the emission .",
    "although we can not observe the blue - shifted emission profile directly ( it is masked by the absorption whose profile we are trying to uncover ) we can approximate it using the reflected red - shifted profile at a complementary orbital phase , assuming spherical symmetry and the hatchett - mccray effect .",
    "the emission flux @xmath81 at velocity @xmath82 and at phase @xmath69 is given by @xmath83 for example , at @xmath84 , the red - shifted emission at high velocities will be diminished as a result of photoionization ; the blue - shifted emission at @xmath25 will be similarly diminished .",
    "( this symmetry is broken because the primary shadows a portion of the red - shifted emission but none of the blue - shifted emission .",
    "however , we can safely neglect this effect because the blue - shifted emission in front of the stellar disk can not have a higher velocity than the blue - shifted absorption . )    the zero - velocity for the reflection of the red - shifted emission is not completely constrained .",
    "we allow two choices : 1 ) that the systemic velocity of lmc  x-4 is identical to that of the lmc , and 2 ) that the systemic velocity of lmc  x-4 is 150  km  s@xmath17 so that the turnover between red - shifted emission and blue - shifted absorption occurs near a velocity of  0 .",
    "we give the measured values of @xmath71 in table  1 .",
    "we consider that a reasonable @xmath85 error for the velocity measurements is 50  km  s@xmath17 .    as an independent check on our measurements of wind velocity",
    ", we examine the maximum velocities at which the absorption profiles vary between two orbital phases .",
    "this is the only method we can apply to the @xmath86 lines , in which the p  cygni absorption can not be separated from the strong interstellar and photospheric lines by examination of the spectrum alone .",
    "the best - fit maximum velocity of the line is at @xmath87 km  s@xmath17 .",
    "we note that we did not observe any red - shifted p  cygni emission in , so were unable to compensate for the variability in the blue - shifted emission .",
    "the maximum velocity of the change in absorption between @xmath88 and @xmath89 is @xmath90 km  s@xmath17 , consistent with the measurements in table  1 . between @xmath89 and @xmath91 ,",
    "the peak velocity of absorption variations is @xmath92 km  s@xmath17 , consistent with the previous measurements ( depending on the model of the blue - shifted emission that is subtracted ) .",
    "however , between @xmath91 and @xmath93 , the maximum velocity of the absorption variations is @xmath94  km  s@xmath17 . this is lower than the velocity inferred from the line profiles alone ( @xmath95 km  s@xmath17 at @xmath96 ) .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : photo ] , the blueshifted absorption may have a component which is produced near the stellar photosphere , rather than in the wind . in this case",
    ", the velocity width of the line may be produced by the rotation of the star , rather than the wind expansion .",

    "the best - fit values and formal errors are presented in table  2 , for 3  possibilities of organizing the data , depending on whether we subtract our model for the blue - shifted emission from the spectra and whether the velocity of the reflection point is 0 or 150  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "we find the best fit using a downhill simplex method ( nelder &  mead , 1965 ) and estimate errors using a monte - carlo bootstrap method .",
    "we plot @xmath71 ( measured from both doublet components ) in figure  7 , along with the analytic fits .",
    "there is no evidence that the wind is nonmonotonic .",
    "all the results indicate that the wind expands more slowly than expected from the radiatively accelerated solution ( which can be well - approximated with @xmath101 ; pauldrach , puls , &  kudritzki 1986 ) .",
    "while there is a large range of @xmath1 that can fit the 3 arrangements of observing @xmath71 ( @xmath102 ) , the choice of @xmath103 provides the lowest @xmath104 and the most reasonable systemic velocity .",
    "( however , note that turbulence in the wind could add a constant velocity to the absorption edge and could cause the data to be well - fit by a nonphysical value of the systemic velocity . )",
    "the models are also consistent with the measurements of the wind veocity from differences of successive spectra of at @xmath105 and at @xmath106 .    while a coincident stellar absorption feature at @xmath107decreases the red - shifted emission for velocities @xmath108  km  s@xmath17 , compensating for this feature in our subtraction of the blue - shifted emission would only _ increase _ slightly the value of @xmath1 that we measure .",
    "our fits for the stellar wind acceleration parameter @xmath1 are not sensitive to our choice of @xmath38 ; using @xmath109 and @xmath110 we find @xmath1 within @xmath85 of values in the first two rows of table  2 , but @xmath111 instead of @xmath112 for the third row .",
    "the effects of microturbulence in the wind on the measured maximum wind velocity should not alter the values we have found for @xmath1 .",

    "when an inhomogeneous wind is allowed , the strength of the absorption in the two components can be more nearly equal , as absorption from the dense wind is saturated .",

    "[ sec : vlaw ] , the change in the maximum velocity of the p  cygni line absorption over orbital phase allows us to infer the radial velocity law in the wind , assuming only that the x - ray source ionizes the entire wind outside of the shadow of the normal star . in ",

    "we have no compelling alternate explanation for our high value of @xmath134 . however , the @xmath10  lines in lmc  x-4 that we observed were weak and were dominated by photospheric absorption .",
    "further observations at phases when @xmath10  is more prominent are needed to test our conclusion that this ion is concentrated near the stellar surface .",
    "it has been shown ( lamers et al .",
    "1987 ) that inaccuracies resulting from the escape probability method can be reduced by computing the radiative transfer integral exactly along the line of sight while continuing to use the source function given by the sobolev approximation .",

    "the method can be used to simulate the effects of local turbulence within the wind , and using the method of olson ( 1982 ) , the effects of overlapping doublets can be computed precisely .",
    "we have implemented a program that uses the sei method to predict the p  cygni line profiles from a wind ionized by an embedded x - ray source .",
    "the details of the wind ionization are identical to those given by equations  [ eq : sobolev ] through [ eq : background2 ] .",
    "we find that in our analysis of lmc  x-4 , the approximation we have made for the doublet overlap gives results very close to those given by olson s method and the sei method .",
    "this may result from the small amount of the doublet overlap in the @xmath214  lines , given a separation of 960  km  s@xmath17 between the doublet components and a wind terminal velocity of 1350  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "using a turbulent velocity @xmath215 that is constant throughout the wind , we find that the line profiles are best fit with @xmath216  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "the sei method also confirms the results of the escape probability model for the @xmath10  lines , as reported in ",
    "[ sec : c4 ] .",
    "although the separation of the @xmath10  lines is only 500  km  s@xmath17 , we suggest that the doublet overlap was not severe during our observations because much of the wind at high velocity had already been ionized , and is concentrated near the primary s surface , at low wind velocities .",
    "we have demonstrated a new method for inferring the radial velocity profile in a stellar wind .",
    "the wind radial velocity law for lmc  x-4 can be fit with @xmath217 , and @xmath218 .",
    "this differs from the expected value of @xmath101 , but the wind in the lmc  x-4 system is likely to deviate from that of an isolated o star .",
    "assumptions of the method , that the wind is spherically symmetric , for example , will need to be revised in light of further observations that cover the entire orbital period .",
    "unfortunately , we did not observe the uv spectrum during the x - ray eclipse when the x - ray ionization of the blueshifted absorption should be minimal , and so our inference of the wind terminal velocity is model - dependent .",
    "observations with stis and the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) during eclipse may distinguish between our alternate models .",
    "the wind terminal velocity we have inferred from our @xmath131 escape probability method , @xmath219  km  s@xmath17 , is lower than the terminal velocities measured for similar stars by lamers , snow , &  lindholm ( 1995 ) .",
    "their stars # 33,37,38,39 , and 44 are all near the 35,000k temperature of lmc  x-4 , but have @xmath220  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "however , stars in the lmc are known to have terminal velocities @xmath221%lower than their galactic counterparts ( garmany &  conti 1985 ) .",
    "we note from the iue data shown in figure  4 that the p  cygni line absorption at orbital phases @xmath222 is greater than that at @xmath223 .",
    "x - ray absorption dips are frequently seen at @xmath224 , possibly indicative of dense gas in a trailing gas stream or accretion wake .",
    "however , it may be difficult for models to reproduce an accretion wake that occults a large fraction of the primary at orbital phases as late as 0.9 .",
    "another possible explanation is that a photoionization wake is present ( fransson &  fabian 1980 , blondin et al .",
    "such a wake results when the expanding wind that has not been exposed to x - rays encounters slower photoionized gas .",
    "while a strong photoionization wake is expected for @xmath58 , the presence of roche lobe overflow and a photoionization wake have been found to be mutually exclusive in some simulations ( blondin et al . 1991 ) .",
    "a further possibility is that at @xmath225 the wind in the cylindar subtending the primary s disk is shielded from ionization by the trailing gas stream .",
    "a simple prediction of this scenario is that there should be more flux in the red - shifted emission at @xmath226 than at @xmath227 .",
    "if the primary star does indeed rotate at half the corotation velocity ( hutchings et al .",
    "1978 ) then the gas stream may trail the neutron star by more than the 22.5@xmath228 predicted by lubow &  shu ( 1975 ) .",
    "we have fit the changing p  cygni line profiles using an escape probability method , assuming a radial , spherically symmetric stellar wind .",
    "however , we note that the hatchett - mccray effect is most sensitive to the region between the @xmath55 surface and the conical shadow of the primary . outside of this region , the wind should be entirely ionized for likely values of @xmath7 and @xmath36 .",
    "the region of the wind that our method is sensitive to is illuminated by x - rays , and its dynamics may be affected as a result ( blondin et al .",
    "structure associated with the distortion of the primary , such as the gas stream and a wind - compressed disk ( bjorkman 1994 ) , may be also be important in this region .",

    "our simultaneous asca observations found a 210  kev flux of @xmath230  erg  s@xmath17  @xmath15 , which given a distance to the lmc of 50  kpc implies @xmath231 and @xmath232 ( our inhomogeneous wind model of  [ sec : inhom ] would imply @xmath233 ) .",
    "there is some uncertainty in applying @xmath231 , as the isotropic x - ray spectrum and luminosity may differ from that observed by asca .",
    "nevertheless , the derived @xmath7 is an order of magnitude larger than that reported by woo et al .",

    "our result for @xmath7 is on the order of the single - scattering limit given by the momentum transfer from the radiation pressure of the primary ; @xmath236 , where the optical luminosity of the primary @xmath237  erg  s@xmath17 ( heemskerk &  van paradijs 1989 ) implies that @xmath238  yr@xmath17 . however ,",
    "if the wind is accelerated by scattering of overlapping lines , one can have @xmath239 ( friend &  castor 1982 ) .",
