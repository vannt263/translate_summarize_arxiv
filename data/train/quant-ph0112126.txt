    "interacting quantum systems that start in uncorrelated states generally evolve towards entangled states due to quantum correlations building up in time .",
    "these correlations and the form they take depend crucially on the interaction that gives rise to them . for example in parametric down conversion or in the optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) pairs of photons can be created in distinct modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the fact that _ pairs _ of photons are generated leads to quantum correlations between the two modes . since each mode is described by a harmonic oscillator , one can think of the state of the field as the quantum state of two fictitious particles in harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "the quantum correlations correspond to e.g. the positions of the particles being strongly correlated , in the ideal case @xmath1 and their momenta being anticorrelated @xmath2 . for the electromagnetic field modes , the position and momenta correspond to quadratures of the field modes and it is between these that correlations are produced @xcite .",
    "these correlations are essential to quantum communication e.g. quantum teleportation of information from one location to another @xcite .",
    "entanglement is also crucial for many schemes in quantum cryptography and for long - distance quantum communication through lossy channels @xcite .",
    "since the mechanism for producing correlations in electromagnetic field modes is at the fundamental level so simple ( photons created in pairs ) it is natural to wonder if such a simple mechanism may lead to entanglement of atoms interacting in a similar manner . in complete analogy to the opa mechanism , a process that transfers _ pairs _ of atoms from their ground state to two well defined final states also gives rise to quantum correlations between atoms .",
    "when a collection of @xmath3 two level atoms is thought of as an ensemble of effective spin @xmath4 particles with total pseudo - angular momentum @xmath5 , it turns out @xcite that the quantum correlations produced by an interaction that transfers atoms in pairs from the lower state to the upper state shows up as reduced fluctuations in a component of the angular momentum e.g. @xmath6 .",
    "we will discuss entanglement of atoms with one another in an atomic ensemble for which an effective interaction leads to the transfer of atoms in pairs to well defined final states and we will use the concept of spin squeezing to quantify the amount of quantum correlations produced in such a case . as for squeezed states of light , decoherence mechanisms and dissipation are acting in such a way as to destroy or limit the amount of squeezing achievable in practice .",
    "we also analyze the influence of such dissipation mechanisms and find relations between the spin squeezing interaction rate , the dissipation rate and the amount of squeezing achievable in the presence of damping mechanisms .",
    "the coherent control of the dynamical evolution of complex systems such as atomic ensembles may lead to the production of entangled non - classical states such as spin squeezed states @xcite ( analogous to squeezed states of light @xcite ) and correlated collective atomic modes ( similar to twin photons generated by a non - degenerate opo ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is that for a collection of @xmath3 atoms with average single atom nonlinearity @xmath7 ( two atom interaction energy ) and with single atom loss rate @xmath8 , the condition for achieving some spin squeezing is that @xmath9 . in order to achieve reduction of uncertainty in say",
    "@xmath10 compared to the uncertainty in the bloch state @xmath11 for which @xmath12 by an amount @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14 ) with @xmath15 , one requires that @xmath16 and the interaction time needed scales as @xmath17 while the maximum number of atoms than can be lost without destroying the squeezing scales as @xmath18 . to achieve heisenberg limited precision ( i.e. maximum spin squeezing @xmath19 ) , one needs a large single atom nonlinearity @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the interaction time needed to achieve this strongly correlated state is @xmath21 and the maximum number of atoms that can be lost without compromising this optimal squeezing is @xmath22 i.e. a very small number of atoms lost may prevent reaching the heisenberg limit .",
    "this analysis remains valid and agrees with a specific implementation based on an effective atom - atom interaction via quantized photon exchange in a cavity , for which the decoherence mechanism corresponds to spontaneous emission and leakage of photons from the cavity .",
    "the possibility of coherently controlling interacting quantum systems has lead to many new developments in the field of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "these are expected to have an impact in a broad area ranging from quantum computation and quantum communication @xcite to precision measurements @xcite and controlled modeling of complex quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "entangled systems realized in the laboratory range in size from few qbits @xcite , to macroscopic ensemble of particles @xcite .",
    "controllable coherent interactions between atoms @xcite may also open the way for modelling of complex quantum phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite in which quantum correlations play a crucial role .",
    "entanglement of a single atomic ensemble , i.e. quantum correlations between atoms in the same ensemble , has been shown to be potentially very useful in the field of precision measurements @xcite .",
    "certain types of interactions between atoms lead to entanglement and spin squeezing , characterized by reduced variance in an observable and increased fluctuations in the canonically conjugate observable .",
    "this reduction of fluctuations directly translates into an improved accuracy for measurements sensitive to that observable .",
    "a typical figure of merit for spin squeezed states is the phase accuracy @xmath23 on estimating accumulated dynamical phase in the ramsey interferometric experiment . with all experimental uncertainties controlled below this noise level ,",
    "the dominant source of noise in such experiments is the `` quantum projection noise '' @xcite associated with e.g. the noise in measurements of the x - component of the spin of an ensemble of two - level atoms ( effective spin @xmath4 ) all prepared in the lower level ( the @xmath24 state ) .",
    "this noise leads to a lower limit on phase accuracy @xmath25 called the standard quantum limit ( sql ) , where @xmath3 is the number of atoms in the ensemble .",
    "the heisenberg uncertainty principle however allows for phase accuracies consistent with the basic principles of quantum mechanics that are as low as @xmath26 , called the heisenberg limit .",
    "we also discuss in more detail a technique @xcite based on a resonantly enhanced nonlinear process involving raman scattering into a `` slow '' optical mode @xcite , which creates a pair of spin - flipped atom and slowly propagating coupled excitation of light and matter ( dark - state polariton ) .",
    "when the group velocity of the polariton is reduced to zero @xcite , this results in pairs of spin flipped atoms .",
    "the dark - state polariton can be easily converted into corresponding states of photon wavepackets `` on demand '' @xcite , which makes the present approach most suitable for implementing protocols in quantum information processing that require a combination of deterministic sources of entangled states and long - lived quantum memory @xcite .",
    "this paper is divided into v sections . in section",
    "ii , we discuss ramsey spectroscopy and the use of spin - squeezed states in precision measurements .",
    "in particular we analyze the situation where @xmath3 two level atoms with levels @xmath27 and @xmath28 are prepared in a correlated state and subsequently probed by separated fields of frequency @xmath29 in the ramsey interferometric configuration , which we review in appendix a. we also discuss spin - squeezed states and develop pictorial representation of those states which we compare to squeezed states of light and in appendix b we introduce the wigner representation for a particular class of spin squezed states .    in section iii , we analyze a model for spin squeezing based on the analogy with the optical parametric oscillator .",
    "we also seek to understand the influence of loss processes on the coherent spin - squeezing interaction and the way in which it limits the correlations achievable for a given interaction rate .",
    "the model consists of two bosonic modes ( a `` spin up '' state and a `` spin down '' state ) with loss rates and a coherent interaction that transfers pairs of atoms from one mode to the other . for our simple model",
    ", analytical results can be obtained in the perturbative regime of small number of excitations ( most atoms in the lower state ) and low loss rate .",
    "we estimate the conditions for which heisenberg - limited spin squeezed states can be produced .",
    "in section iv , we present a scheme for inducing effective coherent interactions between atoms in an atomic ensemble .",
    "these coherent interactions lead to massive entanglement of the ensemble and to characterize the degree of entanglement thus obtained , we calculate the squeezing or reduction in fluctuations of one particular observable . the coherent interaction is based on raman scattering into a cavity mode for which the atomic medium is made transparent by electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) .",
    "the slowly propagating mode is then best described by a polariton : a collective excitation that is partly photonic and partly `` spin '' excitation of the atomic ensemble ( the up and down states of the spin being two metastable states ) .",
    "the overall process leads to the creation of pairs of excitations , one being a `` spin flip '' created by raman scattering , the other being a polariton which can be `` steered '' into a photon or spin flip excitation `` on demand '' .",
    "we find that substantial spin squeezing can be obtained for atomic ensembles in low finesse cavities , without the strong coupling requirement of cavity qed .",
    "in the limit of unity finesse this corresponds to free - space configuration and substantial correlations can still be produced in this case . in the opposite limit of high finesse ,",
    "very strong correlations are obtained and in particular we estimate the regime for which heisenberg limited spin - squeezed states are produced .",
    "in appendix a , ramsey spectroscopy is reviewed and in particular we show how the phase accuracy in phase estimation based on the ramsey fringe signal is , at the maximum sensitivity point , given by    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the variance in the x - component of the pseudo angular momentum ( of length @xmath5 ) representing the state of @xmath3 two - level atoms and @xmath32 is the expectation value of the z - component of the pseudo angular momentum ( both the variance and the expectation value are calculated in the initial state ) .",
    "for an uncorrelated state of atoms e.g. with all atoms in their lower state so that the state of the ensemble is described by @xmath33 , it is found that @xmath34 and @xmath35 so that @xmath36 . in order to improve the phase accuracy",
    ", one must use a state for which the variance in @xmath37 is reduced while @xmath32 is little changed . consider therefore a state such as an eigenstate of @xmath37 , for example @xmath38 . calculating the expectation values and variances",
    "we find @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "however the ramsey signal has amplitude proportional to @xmath42 and therefore vanishes for all phase angles @xmath43 , which means that even though the noise or fluctuation properties of the signal may be improved , its average is zero .",
    "note that this is because we have chosen @xmath44 as our observable , other observables such as @xmath45 for example may lead to non - zero average signal together with reduced variance @xcite .",
    "however , it turns out their signal to noise ratio is very much reduced compared to that of the ramsey scheme @xcite .",
    "it is thus necessary to consider states that lead to a reduced variance @xmath31 while maintaining a large signal amplitude , i.e. a large @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore consider states such as    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is a real number parametrizing the state @xmath48 .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the expectation values @xmath49    and the variances @xmath50 ^{1/2 } .",
    "\\label{varpsia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the signal amplitude which depends on @xmath32 can thus be rather large ( @xmath51 $ ] ) while the noise amplitude characterized by @xmath31 is minimized ( @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "the ramsey signal and phase accuracy for such a state is shown in fig .",
    "1b , compared to the case of uncorrelated atoms ( fig .",
    "these states are minimum uncertainty states i.e. @xmath53 for all values of the parameter @xmath47 .",
    "also , their phase accuracy is given by    @xmath54    which is of order @xmath55 .",
    "the best phase accuracy is obtained for @xmath56 in which case the optimal phase accuracy is @xmath57 .",
    "note that in this case the signal amplitude ( @xmath58 ) becomes vanishingly small ( @xmath59 for all @xmath43 ) and also the range of values of @xmath43 for which improved phase accuracy is achieved becomes vanishingly small around @xmath60 .",
    "for these reasons , the optimally spin squeezed state @xmath61 may prove impractical .",
    "note however that for finite @xmath47 i.e. for @xmath62 , the signal amplitude is large ( @xmath63 ) and the phase accuracy is independent of @xmath43    @xmath64    i.e. twice the heisenberg limit .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the signal and variance for various spin squeezed states along with the phase accuracy @xmath65 .    we can gain a better understanding of the squeezing in the states ( [ psia ] ) @xmath48 by looking at various representations of them . the simplest representation is to project the state onto eigenstates of the three components of the angular momentum    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the eigenstate of the i - component of angular momentum with eigenvalue @xmath68 .    from fig .",
    "3 it is clear that the expectation value of @xmath37 and @xmath69 are zero in such a state , whereas ( for @xmath70 ) the expectation value of @xmath71 is large and negative , the variances are clearly given by ( [ varpsia ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note the similarity of these angular momentum squeezed states and those of a harmonic oscillator ( i.e. squeezed states of light ) . in both cases , the probability distributions vanish for odd number of quanta ( note that for simplicity we consider only @xmath3 even here ) .    for even number of quanta ,",
    "the behaviour is nearly exponential @xmath72 for some constant @xmath73 .",
    "a mechanism for generating such states starting from the uncorrelated state @xmath74 must therefore be one in which atoms are excited in pairs , i.e. two atoms in the ground state are transferred to the excited state @xmath75 .",
    "consider the similarities with squeezed states of light : in particular the photon number distribution vanishes for odd photon number in the case of squeezed vacuum due to the form of the squeezing hamiltonian @xmath76 $ ] , which creates and destroys photons in pairs .",
    "since we find a similar cancellation of the probability of there being odd number of excitations for the states @xmath48 , the interaction giving rise to such states starting from all atoms in their lower states must likewise create and destroy excitations in pairs and thus be of the form @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "this process can also be viewed as a coherent collision mechanism . moreover , for the whole atomic ensemble to become entangled ( not just particular atom pairs ) , this process must occur completely symmetrically for all atoms .",
    "it should not be two particular atoms that get transferred to the excited state , rather it should be two collective excitations that get created    @xmath78 operate on @xmath74 . the simplest hamiltonian giving rise to this type of interaction",
    "is analyzed in section iii to quantify the squeezing generated by this mechanism .",
    "this form of interaction was considered by kitegawa and ueda @xcite in their classic study of spin squeezing and was dubbed the `` two axis countertwisting '' interaction .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the two axis countertwisting hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath79    as argued in last section it is this type of hamiltonian that most closely parallels squeezed state generation for light .",
    "we now present a general theory that allows to quantify atom correlations and takes into account decoherence and finite system size . specifically , we consider two bosonic modes ( such as for a two component bose - einstein condensate or for an atomic ensemble with two relevant atomic levels ) with annihilation operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 . the system is also subject to damping i.e. loss of atoms at rates which may depend on the internal state .",
    "the equations of motion for the two modes are then ( with @xmath82 and @xmath83 )    @xmath84    where @xmath85 are delta - correlated langevin noise forces with appropriate diffusion coefficients @xmath86 .    in order to discuss spin squeezing ,",
    "it is easier to rewrite the equations of motion in terms of the stokes parameters    @xmath87    for which the equations are    @xmath88    where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath85 are new delta - correlated noise forces associated with the damping .    since ( [ fullqmeqns ] ) are non - linear operator equations , in the equations of motion for the first order moments @xmath91 there are terms that depend on those first order moments but also terms depending on the second order moments @xmath92 .",
    "similarly the equations of motion for the second order moments depend on themselves and also on the third order moments , and so on , leading to the bbgky hierarchy of equations of motion for the expectation values of operator products . in order to solve this set of equations",
    ", the hierarchy must be truncated at some order @xcite . keeping the first and second order moments ,",
    "we truncate the bbgky hierarchy by the approximation    @xmath93    the equations of motion for the expectation values @xmath94 and the second order moments @xmath95 are then obtained from ( [ fullqmeqns ] ) .",

    "this number also corresponds to the maximum number of particles that can be lost from the ensemble and not destroy squeezing at the heisenberg limit level . clearly the more squeezed the state of the atoms is , the more sensitive it becomes to atom loss and in general to any form of dissipation .",
    "we now describe a technique to induce effective coherent interactions between atoms in metastable states @xcite . the technique is based on a resonantly enhanced nonlinear process involving raman scattering into a `` slow '' optical mode @xcite , which creates a pair of spin - flipped atom and slowly propagating coupled excitation of light and matter ( dark - state polariton ) . when the group velocity of the polariton is reduced to zero @xcite , this results in pairs of spin flipped atoms .",
