    "hybrid perovskite photovoltaics ( hppv ) @xcite has surprised the photovoltaic community with its record increase in power - conversion efficiency ( pce ) during the last three years @xcite .",
    "the photovoltaic utilization of hybrid organometal - halide perovskites , especially the prototype compound methylammonium ( @xmath4 ) lead triiodide ( @xmath0 , shortened as @xmath5 hereafter ) , was pioneered by kojima _",
    "et al . _ , who used these materials as sensitizers in dye - sensitized solar cells and obtained @xmath6 pce @xcite .",
    "the current state - of - the - art hppv architecture was proposed in 2012 by replacing the liquid electrolyte with solid - state hole - transporting materials , achieving @xmath7 pce @xcite .",
    "this triggered a rapid pce improvement , as reflected by the current pce record of hppvs that broke the @xmath8 mark @xcite .",
    "this pce is already quite close to the best performing inorganic - based single - junction thin - film cells , such as @xmath9 . as photoactive materials ,",
    "hybrid perovskites show several essential advantages in photovoltaic applications , such as band gaps close to the optimal value for single - junction solar - cell absorbers @xcite , excellent absorption properties in the visible part of the solar spectrum @xcite , and high mobilities for both electron and hole transport @xcite , as well as low - temperature processing , low manufacturing cost , light weight , and environmental friendliness .",
    "therefore , have become promising candidates for solar - cell devices which can offer clean , affordable and sustainable energy .",
    "theoretical investigations play an important role in understanding the materials properties and fundamental processes for emergent solar - cell research . along with the rapid development of hppv technologies ,",
    "various theoretical studies have been carried out for hybrid - perovskite - based systems in recent years @xcite .",
    "interesting aspects of these studies include the crystal structures of hybrid perovskites in different phases @xcite , the importance of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) @xcite , many - body effects @xcite , and ferroelectric effects for the electronic structure of hybrid - perovskite semiconductors @xcite .",
    "however , many challenges remain despite this recent progress .",
    "for example , the atomic structure of these materials is still riddled with controversies and it is not yet clear which theoretical approach is most suitable . this is a fundamental question in computational materials science and a prerequisite for further theoretical investigations , especially due to the extreme complexity in the structure of hybrid perovskites . in this context ,",
    "brivio _ et al .",
    "_ observed three local total - energy minima associated with different @xmath10-orientations in @xmath5 @xcite , for which frost _ et al . _ obtained a distribution using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics , claiming that the orientation of @xmath11@xmath12 bonds along the @xmath13 $ ] direction ( `` face - to - face '' ) is the most populated @xcite .",
    "egger and kronik found only one preferred @xmath10-orientation and attributed its stability to hydrogen bonding @xcite .",
    "reported two local total - energy minima with a @xmath14-per - unit - cell difference in favor of the `` @xmath15$]''-orientation which is very close to the structure studied by egger and kronik but very different from the `` @xmath16 $ ] '' ( `` edge - to - edge '' ) structure of brivio _ et al .",
    "conversely , the calculations by yin _",
    "_ indicated that the `` @xmath17$]''-orientation ( along the diagonal of the unit cell ) is energetically more favorable @xcite .",
    "this plethora of competing structural models is a result of different computational approaches , for example , different density functionals , the use of the long - range van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , and full relativistic effects .    in this work ,",
    "we perform a comprehensive analysis of the atomic structure of hybrid perovskites .",
    "we focus on the impact of dispersive interactions , which have only been included in three of the many density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations for hppvs @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the incorporation of vdw interactions into the dft calculations results in unit - cell volumes in good agreement with experiments .",
    "however , the impact of vdw interactions on the atomic structure ( including the relative location of the organic cation and the deformation of the inorganic framework ) has not been investigated so far . employing the tkatchenko - scheffler ( ts ) pairwise dispersion scheme @xcite ,",
    "egger and kronik were able to calculate the vdw interaction energy between each interatomic pair for an optimized @xmath5 geometry , and found that the iodine - iodine interaction ( @xmath18 per pair ) has the largest contribution to the overall dispersive ( ts ) correction of total energy @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , more calculations and analysis are required to understand the impact of vdw interactions on the atomic structure of hybrid perovskites .    in this work",
    ", we investigated the prototype hybrid perovskite @xmath5 and three isostructural systems , methyl - ammonium tin triiodide ( @xmath19 ) , methylammonium lead trichloride ( @xmath20 ) and caesium lead triiodide ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these three perovskites can be regarded as close relatives of the prototype @xmath21 , as each of them only differs from it by one component : the monovalent cation ( @xmath3 ) , the divalent cation ( @xmath19 ) , or the halide ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , our study facilitates a systematic analysis of interatomic interactions in metal- and organometal - trihalide perovskites .",
    "for example , we can compare the vdw interactions between the organic @xmath10 cation and the iodide anions in @xmath5 and in @xmath19 , or the @xmath22-@xmath23 interaction in @xmath5 and its counterpart ( @xmath24-@xmath23 ) in @xmath3 .    of particular interest in this paper",
    "is the question how the organic and the inorganic component in hppvs interact with each other . does the inorganic framework",
    "deform on its own and the @xmath10 cation then accommodates itself in a particular orientation in the deformed cage ? or does the @xmath10 cation force the inorganic framework into a particular deformation ?",
    "we address this _ chicken - and - egg _ problem with density - functional theory to gain atomistic insight that will be useful for future hppv design .",
    "in addition , we ask the question : which effect vdw interactions and hydrogen bonds have on the interplay between the organic and the inorganic component in hppvs ?",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] we outline the model systems and the computational details of our dft calculations .",
    "section  [ results ] presents the lattice constants and atomic structures for all considered systems .",
    "we discuss the interplay of the organic cation and the inorganic framework as well as the impact of vdw interactions in detail .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] concludes with a summary .",
    "we adopted the cubic ( @xmath25 ) primitive - cell model for all compounds thus neglecting the disorder of @xmath10 cations .",
    "the ions were initially placed at the wyckoff positions of the @xmath25 space group , as shown in fig .",
    "[ perovskite ] : the monovalent cation @xmath26 at 1b , the divalent heavy - metal cation @xmath27 at 1a , and the halide anions @xmath28 at 3d . for hybrid ( organic - inorganic )",
    "perovskites , the organic @xmath10 cation was initially placed at the unit - cell center ( the 1b wyckoff position ) with several inequivalent @xmath11@xmath12 orientations .",
    "this model not only allows for a direct comparison to previous studies , but can also provide a basic and informative description of the atomic structure .",
    "we are currently also carrying out first - principles calculations for supercell models .",
    "the results will be presented elsewhere in the future .     in this paper .",
    "the monovalent cation @xmath29 , the divalent cation @xmath30 and the halide anions @xmath31 are represented by the green , blue and red spheres , respectively . ]    for each perovskite , we optimized the lattice constant and atomic geometry using the following protocol : ( i ) the forces on the nuclei were minimized for a fixed shape and size of the cubic unit - cell .",
    "( ii ) the optimized lattice constant was determined from the minimum of the total - energy _ vs. _ volume curve .",
    "we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation @xcite as the exchange - correlation functional throughout this work .",
    "this choice was based on our test calculations , which indicated that hybrid functionals ( that combine exact exchange with pbe exchange ) change the lattice constants by less than @xmath32 , but increase the computational cost ( both memory and cpu time ) by approximately one order of magnitude .",
    "soc , which has already been demonstrated to be very important for the electronic structures of ( especially lead - based ) hybrid perovskites @xcite , does not strongly influence the lattice constants as shown by egger _",
    "_ @xcite and our test calculations .",
    "thus , we only included scalar relativistic effects in our calculations via the zero - order regular approximation @xcite .",
    "corrections due to long - range vdw interactions were taken into account by employing the ts method based on the hirshfeld partitioning of the electron density @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the calculations incorporating ts - vdw are labelled by `` pbe+vdw '' hereafter .",
    "we used the default parameters in ts - vdw for neutral atoms ( listed in table  s1 of the supplemental material , sm ) without explicitly calculating the @xmath33 coefficients based on ionic reference systems @xcite .",
    "a @xmath34-centered @xmath35 k - point mesh was used for the periodic dft calculations .",
    "all calculations were performed using the all - electron local - atomic - orbital code ` fhi - aims ` @xcite .",
    "at each trial lattice constant , the optimization of our hybrid perovskites results in two local total - energy minima , corresponding to two different structures denoted by @xmath36-*a * and * b * , as illustrated in fig .  [ pbevdwstructure ] .",
    "for ease of reporting , we shift the whole lattice so that the coordinate of @xmath37 or @xmath38 becomes @xmath39 ( the 1a wyckoff position ) .",
    "the two geometries correspond to two orientations of the @xmath11@xmath12 bond . in case",
    "* a * , the @xmath11@xmath12 bond is precisely oriented along the @xmath17 $ ] ( diagonal ) direction and colinear with the unit - cell center as well as the @xmath37 or @xmath38 atom . in case * b * , the @xmath11@xmath12 bond is located in the @xmath40 plane and deviates from the @xmath13 $ ] ( face - to - face ) direction by an angle which depends on the hybrid - perovskite composition , the lattice constant , and the dft method . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the structure remained in the initial cubic geometry during the relaxation .    for a quantitative description of the atomic structure ,",
    "we define several quantities that are related to the location of the organic cation and the deformation of the inorganic framework .",
    "the definition of these quantities is illustrated graphically in fig .",
    "[ structuralquantities ] .",
    "the orientation of @xmath10 is characterized by @xmath41 , the ratio among the projection of the @xmath11@xmath12 bond onto the lattice - vector directions @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( fig .  [ structuralquantities]a ) .",
    "the position of @xmath10 relative to the center of the cubic unit cell is described by @xmath45 , which is defined by the ratio of the nitrogen - to - cell - center distance to the carbon - to - cell - center distance ( fig .",
    "[ structuralquantities]b ) .",
    "the @xmath46 values , that is , the deviation of an @xmath31 cation from its `` ideal '' wyckoff position in the @xmath25 space group ( see fig .",
    "[ structuralquantities]c ) , is closely related to the deformation of the @xmath47-framework .",
    "since we are working within the cubic primitive - cell model for all considered systems in this paper , we can use dimensionless fractional coordinates to calculate distances .    the @xmath41 ratio in case * a * is @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 , and so forth , for other equivalent structures ) . in case * b * , this ratio can be written as @xmath50 ( or equivalently @xmath51 , and so forth ) with @xmath52 .",
    "the angle between the @xmath11@xmath12 bond and the @xmath13 $ ] direction is @xmath53 .",
    "table  [ latticeconstants ] lists the results of our geometry optimization .",
    "first , for each hybrid perovskite , the lattice constant of case * a * is larger than case * b * , but the difference is small .",
    "therefore , different orientations of the @xmath11@xmath12 bond do not cause large changes in the unit - cell volume in this cubic primitive - cell model .",
    "second , the inclusion of ts - vdw causes a significant reduction of the optimized lattice constants ( approximately @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath5 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 , respectively ) .",
    "the lattice constants optimized with pbe+vdw agree well with experimental data .",
    "specifically , for both @xmath5 and @xmath19 the overestimation amounts to @xmath58 , for @xmath20 the overestimation is @xmath59 , and for @xmath3 the underestimation is less than @xmath60 .",
    "these lattice constants agree well with the first - principles studies of egger _",
    "_ @xcite and motta _ et al .",
    "third , structure * b * is more stable than * a * for all investigated hybrid compounds as it corresponds to a lower total - energy minimum . a larger total - energy difference ( thus also cohesive - energy difference )",
    "is obtained when including ts - vdw in the pbe calculations .",

    "+    we have also performed direct lattice - vector optimization using the analytical stress tensor implemented in ` fhi - aims ` @xcite . for case * a * , the optimized structure remains cubic with slight difference in the lattice constants ; while for case * b * , the cubic symmetry is broken , resulting in an orthorhombic lattice . to focus our analysis , we therefore do not further discuss the results of the stress - tensor optimization in this paper , but will return to it in future work .",
    "furthermore , we remark that caution has to be applied when comparing dft lattice constants to experiment . conventional dft calculations ( for example , the pbe+vdw calculations in this work ) are carried out at @xmath91 , while experimental lattice constants for the cubic structures of hybrid perovskites are measured at room temperature or above .",
    "for example , the lattice constant @xmath92 for @xmath5 was measured at above @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the lattice constant at @xmath94 will therefore likely be larger than that at @xmath91 due to thermal expansion .",
    "preliminary calculations indicate that the thermal expansion is of the order of @xmath95 @xcite and therefore will only change the lattice constant at @xmath94 by approximately @xmath96 .",

    "this requires two observables : position and orientation .",

    "table  [ b - coordinates ] shows that , similar to structure * a * , @xmath45 decreases when ts - vdw is included in the dft calculations , which corresponds to a smaller displacement of the @xmath10 cation from @xmath176 . the @xmath11@xmath12 bond in structure * b *",

    "for example , this angle is @xmath259 in the pbe geometry of @xmath5 , and becomes @xmath260 in the pbe+vdw geometry .",
    "similar to structure * a * , the position and orientation of @xmath10 in structure * b * adjust to form hydrogen bonds between the hydrogen atoms at the nitrogen - end and the halide anions .",
    "since there are two parameters determining the @xmath10-geometry , it is not easy to derive a clear trend among the three investigated hybrid perovskites .",
    "nevertheless , we can still determine some relationships .",
    "for example , table  [ structuralparameters ] shows very close @xmath41 ratios for the geometry of the two iodide - based hybrid perovskites optimized with pbe+vdw , while the lattice constant of @xmath19-*b * is noticeably smaller than that of @xmath5-*b*. therefore a larger deviation of @xmath10 from the unit - cell center in @xmath5-*b * is required for @xmath127(@xmath12)@xmath129 bonding , as demonstrated by the fact that @xmath45 of @xmath5-*b * is larger than of @xmath19-*b*.    the @xmath31 anions deviate from their ideal 3d wyckoff positions as shown in table  [ b - coordinates ] .",
    "this is closely related to the @xmath127(@xmath12)@xmath128 hydrogen bonding .",

    "to structure * a * where all halide anions equally participate in the hydrogen bonding , the three halides in the unit cell of structure * b * play different roles when interacting with the @xmath141 group .",
    "specifically , the @xmath31 anion approximately located at @xmath178 ( the first @xmath261 in each block of table  [ b - coordinates ] , which is located in the @xmath40 plane ) forms a hydrogen bond with one hydrogen of the @xmath141 group . in pbe geometries ,",
    "this halide anion is significantly `` pulled '' toward the @xmath10 cation along @xmath42 , and `` pushed '' away from the @xmath10 cation along @xmath44 ( that is , the @xmath44-coordinate is larger than one ) . the deviation along @xmath42 is larger than along @xmath44 by a factor of @xmath262 . for both @xmath5-*b * and @xmath19-*b * , the inclusion of ts - vdw reduces its @xmath42-deviation by a factor of @xmath262 , and slightly enlarges the @xmath44-deviation .",
    "this is an accumulative result of the @xmath45-decrease and the reduced @xmath263 ratio : they cause a decrease of the @xmath42-coordinate together with an increase of @xmath44 of the nitrogen s position , and accordingly a movement of this halide s position .",
    "two @xmath31 anions , which are approximately located at @xmath264 and @xmath179 , and therefore are equivalent to each other , form hydrogen bonds with the other two hydrogen atoms at the nitrogen - end .",
    "each of them simultaneously forms two hydrogen bonds with @xmath10 cations in neighbouring unit cells because of the periodic boundary condition .",
    "table  [ b - coordinates ] shows that , the deviation of these halides positions from the 3d wyckoff positions along @xmath42 is much larger than that along @xmath44 , and the effect of ts - vdw on their positions is rather small . besides , the @xmath31 anion approximately located at @xmath177 or equivalent positions ( the one without the superscript - label `` @xmath265 '' in table  [ b - coordinates ] ) does not participate in hydrogen bonding . nevertheless , its deviation along @xmath44 is significantly larger than each of the other two halide anions , and this deviation is nearly unaffected by the inclusion of ts - vdw .",
    "in addition , ts - vdw reduces its deviation along @xmath42 by a factor of @xmath262 .",
    "moreover , the impact of ts - vdw on the the positions of the chloride anions in @xmath20 is much smaller than that for both iodide - based hybrid compounds , which agrees with the fact that the vdw interactions cause the smallest change of @xmath263 in this system .    from the pbe+vdw results of structure",

    "we start from an ideal @xmath272-framework in model i , that is , no inorganic - framework deformations .",
    "we evaluate model i at both the pbe and the pbe+vdw lattice constants .",

    "the corresponding inorganic - framework distortion reduces slightly , manifested in a decrease of @xmath270 .",
