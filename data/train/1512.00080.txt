    "in this manuscript we give a new proof of the identity    @xmath2    using tools from topological combinatorics . to our knowledge , this is the first instance of using such tools to study an identity involving alternating sums of binomial coefficients .",
    "we hope this approach may illuminate past difficulties that have arisen in resolving  closed - form \" descriptions of identities involving powers of binomial coefficients in other enumerative disciplines ( see sections [ sec_discussion ] and [ sec_futurework ] for a discussion of these issues ) .",
    "the identity ( [ dixid ] ) is first attributed to alfred cardew dixon ( 1865 - 1936 ) .",
    "dixon originally proved ( [ dixid ] ) in the paper  on the sum of the cubes of the coefficients in a certain expansion by the binomial theorem \" in _ messenger of mathematics _ volume 20 @xcite , which is a journal that ceased to publish in 1929 .",

    "the general case ( [ 3f2 ] ) is called the _ well - poised @xmath8 transformation _ , and so is an example of a hypergeometric identity ( see page 97 of @xcite ) .",
    "see the proof of lemma 4.2 in the paper @xcite for an example of an application of the identity ( [ 3f2 ] ) in topological combinatorics . we have not found a topological interpretation of the identity [ 3f2 ] , but we note the generalization because we believe the merit of studying ( [ dixid ] ) arises from the connection it represents between enumeration techniques in number - theoretic algebraic combinatorics , topological combinatorics , and the general study of identities .",
    "establishing ( [ dixid ] ) using a generating function is a relatively simple exercise ( see , for example , page 23 of @xcite ) .",
    "the novel contribution of this manuscript is the connection between ( [ dixid ] ) and the combinatorial properties of a topological space , in particular a shellable simplicial complex .",
    "therefore , we begin with a brief introduction to shellability and the necessary background for shellable simplicial complexes .",

    ".    shlfli assumed theorem [ boundary_thm ] in the nineteenth century when he computed the euler characteristic of a convex polytope @xcite ( see lecture 3 of @xcite for a nice historical discussion of this ) , but theorem [ boundary_thm ] was not proved until 1970 @xcite , and was soon used in important results such as the proof of the upper bound theorem for simplicial polytopes @xcite . in this manuscript , we will only define shellability for simplicial complexes .",
    "shellability helps one to understand the structure of a simplicial complex via its topological and combinatorial qualities .",
    "however , there are other properties of simplicial complexes with similar utility that have a long history in the literature and remain active areas of study .",
    "these include partitionability @xcite , collapsibility @xcite , and contractibility @xcite .",
    "furthermore , relationships between such properties are still being resolved in recent papers such as @xcite .",

    "so , the modifier _ reduced _ in this context specifically indicates the inclusion of @xmath33 as a face .    a very useful set of topological invariants of a simplicial complex is the set of betti numbers .",
    "to define betti numbers we must first understand the notion of the ( simplicial ) homology groups of a simplicial complex .",
    "for an introduction to simplicial homology , see , for example , section 2.1 @xcite . for a simplicial complex @xmath10 ,",
