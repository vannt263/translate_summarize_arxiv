    "@xmath64 , we plot the total cbp @xmath65 as a function of time for various magnitudes of energy gap .",
    "firstly , in agreeing with gapless graphene , we obtain the irreversible feature of electron dynamics in strong electric field of a optical pulse when the pulse is over , and secondly , the residual of cbp is considerable even in high energy gaps .",
    "however , the energy gap in graphene causes to decrease a little the maximum of the cbp .",
    "to more clarify , the dependence of maximum and residual cbp on the massive dirac - like electrons is particularly presented in fig .",
    "we observe that , for low energy gaps , the maximum and residual cbp show fundamentally distinct behaviors , whereas they are equal and , of course , decrease rapidly for large energy gaps .",
    "further , we consider the transition probability ( tp ) @xmath67 for four dirac points ( see fig .",

    "this feature is shown in figure @xmath72 .",
    "for right side of dirac points in fig .",
    "@xmath68 , the tp occurs for negative values of electric field of optical pulse , and for left side once it happens for positive electric field .    using the acceleration theorem",
    ", we investigate the distribution of electrons around dirac points @xmath2 and @xmath3 during the pulse . in figs .",

    ", the maximum peak of laser field is at @xmath76 , for @xmath77 the field is negative which accelerates the electrons to the right .",
