    "electronic systems close to magnetic instability has drawn a lot of both experimental and theoretical attention because of their interesting and often unexpected properties arising from the interaction of electrons with the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "recently close - to - ferromagnetic behavior was observed in @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this compound shows a very interesting unusual magnetic characteristics .",
    "especially magnetic and specific heat measurements indicate that this compound is very close to ferromagnetic instability and shows ferromagnetic ordering after rare earth element doping .",
    "this compound joins other prototype itinerant ferromagnets zrzn@xmath5 , sc@xmath6 in and tibe@xmath7cu@xmath8 .",
    "resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements of this compound show the pauli paramagnet displaying fermi liquid behavior , an indication that the ti in the 4@xmath9 and not the magnetic 3@xmath9 state .",
    "the value of @xmath10 from the suscepibility measurements is @xmath11 emu / g , which is typical value of intermetallic compounds .",
    "an interesting result comes from the heat capacity measurement .",
    "the heat capacity was measured in the temperature range @xmath12 and straight line which fits to the low temperature part of the @xmath13 versus @xmath14 gives a value of @xmath15 mj / k@xmath16mol . using the values of @xmath17",
    "emu / g and @xmath18 , drymiotis and coworkers estimated the wilson ratio @xmath19 which indicates that @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 is a correlated system@xcite .",
    "another interesting results are the effects of doping with rare earth elements .",
    "the small amounts of ce , la or co impurities drove the system to the ferromagnetic ( fm ) state , with the ordering temperatures of the order of 150 k. it was shown that the magnetic behavior is intrinsic to the @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 , i.e. , it is not the case of magnetic impurities in non - magnetic host . for example , the susceptibility measurements on la@xmath8ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 show ferromagnetic ordering with a critical temperature equal to t@xmath20 .",
    "the constituent elements are non - magnetic , with the exception of ti which in the ti@xmath9 configuration carries an effective moment of @xmath21 .",
    "susceptibility measurements of the undoped @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 show the pauli paramagnetism , which is an indication that the ti is in a non - magnetic ground state .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 based on density functional theory .",
    "in particular we have calculated the bandstructures , fermi surfaces and linear specific heat coefficient .",
    "large enhancement of the static susceptibility over its non - interacting value is found due to a peak in the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the crystal structure of @xmath0-ti@xmath4sn@xmath3 belongs to the non - symmorphic hexagonal space group p6@xmath22/mmc .",
    "this crystal structure is described in detail by kleinke@xcite .",
    "there are three distinct sn sites , ( ( 0,0,0 ) , ( 1/3,2/3 , 1/4),(0.795 , 0.590 , 1/4 ) ) with site symmeties @xmath23 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively and two ti sites ( ( 1/2 , 0,0),(0.165,0.330,1/4 ) ) with site symmeties @xmath25 and @xmath24 respectively",
    ". it does not seem to be a simple manner in which to see the structure but it appears that the ti sites form groups of tetrahedral along the ( 001 ) direction . @xmath0-ti@xmath4sn@xmath3 is the only known compound which forms this structure .",
    "the lattice constants a and c are 9.24 @xmath26 and 5.71 @xmath26 respectively .",
    "there are two formular units per primitive cell .",
    "alternatively the crystal structure of @xmath0-ti@xmath4sn@xmath3 can be viewed as ababa stacking of ti and ti - sn layers with a separation of @xmath27 .",
    "the a - plane contains 3 ti atoms per unit cell forming a 2d kagome lattice .",
    "the b - plane contains 3 ti and 5 sn atoms .",
    "it is interesting to note that ti atoms in the b - plane form slightly distorted kagome laticce ( the deviations from the ideal bondlenght being @xmath28 ) .",
    "the b-layer is the inversion image of the b - layer .",
    "the in - plane nearest - neighbor ti - ti distance are 4.61 (a - plane ) and 4.61@xmath290.05 (b - plane ) .",
    "we have calculated the electronic structure using the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis ( fplo ) method @xcite to solve the kohn - sham equations of density functional theory .",
    "scalar relativistic approximation and the exchange - correlation functional of perdew and wang @xcite were use throughout this work .",
    "ti @xmath30 states and sn @xmath31 were included as valence states .",
    "all lower states were treated as core states .",
    "we included the relatively extended semicore 3s , 3p states of ti and 4s , 4p , states of sn as band states because of the considerable overlap of these states on nearest neighbors .",
    "this overlap would be otherwise neglected in our fplo scheme .",
    "ti 4p states were added to increase the quality of the basis set .",
    "the spatial extension of the basis orbitals , controlled by a confining potential @xmath32 , was optimized to minimize the total energy .",
    "the self - consistent potentials were carried out on a k mesh of 12 k points in each direction of the brillouin zone , which corresponds to 133 k points in the irreducible zone . a careful sampling of the brillouin zone is necessitated by the fine structures in the density of states near fermi level e@xmath33 .",
    "in fig . [ band ] and fig . [ dos ]",
    "we show the bandstructure and the density of state respectively .",
    "the bands in the vicinity of the fermi level have dominant ti @xmath34 character with the role of sn to be merely to provide electrons .",
    "the sn @xmath35 bands lie between -10 ev and -5 ev . around -5",
    "ev there are ti 4s states , above them the bands of sn @xmath36 spread over to the fermi level .",
    "the ti @xmath34 bands lie between -2.5 ev and 5 ev and they dominate the fermi level .",
    "the bandstructure provides explanation of the rather high peaks in the density of state , in particular close to the fermi level . while the bands in @xmath37mk plane exhibit sizable dispersion their counterparts in the alh plane are rather flat .",
    "we offer the following explanation of this interesting feature .",
    "the ti sublattice consists of kagome lattices , well known for a disperssionless band in their spectrum , coupled along the @xmath38-axis . since the ti - ti inter - layer ( a - a ) bond is shorter than the ti - ti intra - layer distance , the inter - layer coupling is strong ( see also @xmath37-a dispersion ) and the bandstructure does not exhibit 2d features .",
    "however , the nearest neighbor inter - layer hopping does not contribute to the dispersion in the alh plane .",
    "this can be shown by taking the @xmath39 bloch sums of the relevant @xmath40 orbitals and considering the even parity of the @xmath40 functions .",
    "thus with the contribution of the main hopping being zero the alh dispersion reflects the intra - layer hopping .",
    "the corresponding fermi surfaces ( fs ) of @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath37 point is located at the center of the hexagonal prisim .",
    "the large fs in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fs ] is due to the ti 3d states ; the contribution of sn states to these sheets is very small .",
    "we also calucated the lsda magnetic band structures for the @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 , in which the exchange spliting is almost negligible .",
    "et al._@xcite measured the linear specific heat coefficient for @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 of @xmath18=40 mj / k@xmath16 mole(formular unit ) .",
    "the calculated value of @xmath41=41.5 states / ry / ti for @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 corresponds to a bare value @xmath42=42.7 mj / k@xmath16 mole(formular unit ) , which is in good agreement with the experimental one .",
    "the presence of an electronic instability is signaled by a divergence of the corresponding susceptibility . in the following",
    "we study the uniform magnetic susceptibility using the method of janak @xcite .",
    "the uniform magnetic susceptibility of a metal can be written as    @xmath43    where the numerator stands for the pauli susceptibility of a gas of non - interacting electrons proportional to the density of states at the fermi level @xmath44 , and the denominator represents the enhancement due to electron - electron interaction . within the kohn - sham formalism of density functional theory the stoner parameter @xmath45",
    "is related to the second derivative of the exchange - correlation fuctional with respect to the magnetization density .",
    "we have evaluated , within the density functional theory formalism , the stoner enhancement of the susceptibility @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the non - interacting susceptibility and @xmath48 gives the electron - electron enhancement in terms of the stoner constant @xmath45 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath45 using both the janak - vosko - perdew theory @xcite and fixed spin moment calculations@xcite .",
    "the calculated density of states and stoner parameter normalized per ti atom are @xmath44=41.5 states / ry / ti and @xmath45=22.9 mry . by comparing the calculated value of the density of states with the measured susceptibility ,",
    "a stoner enhancement s=@xmath49^{-1 } \\approx 20 $ ] was obtained , indicating @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 a strongly exchange enhanced metal .",
    "the presence of a peak close below the fermi level suggest that a very small hole or electron doping can drive system into ferromagnetic regime .",
    "the experimental reports @xcite show that @xmath0-ti@xmath3sn@xmath4 is located at the boundary between non - magnetic and ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "this is supported by the large value of @xmath18 , obtained from heat capacity measurements which corresponds to the peak at the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the transition to the ferromagnetic ground state occurs after a small amount of doping on the ti site .",
    "our fixed moment calculations clearly shows that the @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 is located at the magnetic instability , which agrees very well with the experimental results .",
    "itinerant magnetism is a consequence of an enhanced density of states at the fermi level , consistent with the large values of @xmath18 in the low temperature specific heat data and the magnetic moment is carried by the carriers that take part in the transport .",
    "the enhanced density of states and increase in electronic correlations produce the formation of a local moment whose magnitude is related to the band structure at the fermi level .",
    "our fixed moment calculations clearly shows that the @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 is located at the magnetic instability , which agrees very well with the experimental results .",
    "the calculation indicates that @xmath0-ti@xmath1sn@xmath2 is very close to ferromagnetic instability and shows ferromagnetic ordering after rare earth element doping .",
    "large enhancement of the static susceptibility over its non - interacting value is found due to a peak in the density of states at the fermi level ."
