    "quantum phase transitions and correlation functions in quantum spin systems have been attracted much attention due to their potential variety of quantum phenomena . for instance",
    ", previous works have shown an emergence of magnon - based bose - einstein condensation near a saturation field  @xcite , and spinon - based metal - insulator transitions induced by a magnetic field  @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "the quantum spins behave like either a bosonic object ( magnon ) or a fermionic one ( spinon ) , where the magnetic field plays a role of a chemical potential for the magnons or spinons .",
    "in addition , the present authors have recently presented another type of spin character in a magnetic field , where the quantum spins are reconstructed into quasi - spins with an effective magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction reproduces a quasi - spin hamitonian that is very similar to the original hamitonian .",
    "therefore , several resemblaces appear in physical quantities with a revision of the quasi - spins as magnetic objects .",
    "recently , a frustarted quantum spin ladder ( f - qsl ) has been investigated , because it is expected to correspond to an effective spin model of the real compound bicu@xmath0po@xmath1  @xcite and several magnetic phase transitions have been observed in the compound  @xcite . since some of the magnetic phase transitions can not be understood without a frustration , an effect of the frustration should be crucial to clarify the phase transitions . in practice , with a strong frustration , the present authors have found some magnetic phase transitions with magnetization plateaux in the same model . in order to understand the magnetization curve of bicu@xmath0po@xmath1",
    ", it is important to examine their magnetic phases in detail one by one . in this paper",
    ", we study a plateau of magnetization @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the saturated magnetization .",
    "a hamiltonian of the f - qsl normalized by the rung - coupling @xmath4 in a magnetic field @xmath5 is given by , @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the @xmath10 spin operator on the @xmath11 site in the upper ( lower ) chain and its @xmath12 component is @xmath13 . here",
    ", @xmath14 denotes a nearest neighbor magnetic exchange coupling in the leg normalized by @xmath4 , and the second - neighbor one is denoted by @xmath15 , which plays a role of the geometrical frustration in the leg .",
    "the normalized magnetic field is positively defined as @xmath16 .",
    "below , we consider only the anti - ferromagnetic interactions , i.e. , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the strong rung - coupling limit , @xmath19 .      in the strong rung coupling limit @xmath20 with finite magnetizations , a quasi - spin transformation and a reduced hamiltonian",
    "are useful to understand the ground state and the low - energy physics . in order to obtain the reduced hamiltonian ,",
    "we start with two spin hamiltonian on a rung as follows , @xmath21 with a jordan - wigner transformation of spin operators , @xmath22 and the number operators @xmath23 . to diagonalize this hamiltonian , we can use a bonding and an anti - bonding operators for create and annihilate operators of jordan - wigner fermions , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . with the number operator of the bonding and an anti - bonding jordan - wigner fermions @xmath26 , the rung hamiltonian is rewritten as , @xmath27 we can obtain a quasi - spin transformation with an inverse jordan - wigner transformation as follows , @xmath28 and @xmath29 these operators also satisfy the spin su(2 ) algebra for themselves , and commutate each other .",
    "the quasi - spin operators rewrite the rung hamiltonian as , @xmath30 where effective quasi - magnetic fields , @xmath31 with the quasi - spin operators , the leg hamiltonian between @xmath11-th and @xmath32-th rungs is given by , @xmath33 + t_{j,{\\mathrm}{m}}^+ t_{k,{\\mathrm}{m}}^-\\cos{\\left } [ \\frac{\\pi}{2}(t_{j,{\\mathrm}{p}}^z - t_{k,{\\mathrm}{p}}^z){\\right } ] \\notag\\\\ & { \\hspace{2em}}{\\hspace{2em}}-",

    "is obtained as @xmath47 . here ,",
    "anisotropic exchange interactions @xmath48 are defined as , @xmath49 where the anisotropy of the quasi - spin exchange interactions is given by @xmath50 . for the aim of calculations , we note that the explicit forms of the quasi - spin operators on @xmath11-th rung @xmath51 is given by , @xmath52,\\label{tr1}\\\\ t_{j}^z&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[(s_{j,{\\mathrm}{u}}^z+s_{j,{\\mathrm}{l}}^z)+s_{j,{\\mathrm}{u}}^+s_{j,{\\mathrm}{l}}^-+s_{j,{\\mathrm}{u}}^-s_{j,{\\mathrm}{l}}^+\\right],\\label{tr2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , our problem of the frustrated spin ladder ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) is reduced to the anisotropic spin chain ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) using the transformations ( [ tr1 ] ) and ( [ tr2 ] ) .",
    "this fact makes it easier to analyze some correlation functions .      in this paper",
    ", we examine two types of correlation functions of quasi - spin operators , namely , spin - spin and dimer - dimer correlation functions .",
    "these correlation functions will show us a phase transition between a gapless spin - liquid phase and a gapful dimer phase of the frustrated spin chain system .",
    "since the frustrated spin chain system is the effective hamiltonian of the f - qsl in the strong rung - coupling limit with @xmath531/2 , those correlation functions of quasi - spins will clarify the gapless - to - gapful phase transition of the f - qsl .",
    "we define a correlation functions between two quasi - spin operators , @xmath54 where @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) denotes the site - index counted from the left ( right ) end of the chain , and determines the distance between two sites @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of rungs .",
    "the dimer - dimer correlation functions of quasi - spin operators is given by , @xmath60 where @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is a @xmath12 component of a quasi - spin dimer operator defined as , @xmath63    below , we use the following definition of the expectation values of the quasi - spin and quasi - dimer operators in the real space as , @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "in order to obtain the critical point of the gapless - to - gapful phase transition in the strong rung - coupling limit , we calculate the bound energies at @xmath2 with a fixed @xmath66 for various frustrations by using the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the bound energy at @xmath67 is defined as , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the lowest energy with a magnetization @xmath70 .",
    "if there is a magnetization plateau at @xmath71 , the bound energy @xmath72 corresponds to the width of the flat region in the magnetization curve . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , the bound energy with a weak frustration @xmath73 is extrapolated to zero , although a strong frustration @xmath74 induces a finite bound energy in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "we find a critical point of the gapless - to - gapful phase transition between @xmath75 and @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the bound energy turns to decrease as the frustration increases over @xmath77 , because the ground state should approach another gapless phase in decoupled quasi - spin chains in the strong frustration limit @xmath78 .    .",
    "( a ) , solid lines are determined by the least squares method.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]      we also calculate the expectation values and correlation functions of quasi - spin and quasi - dimer operators by using the dmrg method . these are calculated in a 72-rung f - qsl under the open boundary condition for two values of the frustration @xmath73 and @xmath79 , with a fixed @xmath66 .",
    "figure 2 ( a ) shows that real - space distributions of the expectation values of quasi - spin and quasi - dimer operators . in this figure",
    ", we can see that the quasi - spins localize around the edges of the system and the expectation values ( @xmath80 ) monotonically decrease to the center of the system for both @xmath73 and @xmath79 . on the other hand",
    ", the quasi - dimer operator has a large expectation value for @xmath81 as compared with @xmath73 .",
    "this character is also confirmed by the correlation functions in fig .  2  ( b ) .",
    "we can see that the correlation functions of quasi - spin and dimer operators decay in the power law with a weak frustration @xmath73 .",
    "thus , the @xmath2 state with @xmath73 is understood as a gapless spin - liquid state of the quasi - spins , where the any correlation functions of the quasi - spins decays in the power low . with a strong frustration @xmath81 , however , the correlation function of the quasi - dimer opeartor ( @xmath82 ) retains a finite value in the infinite length limit , although the correlation function of quasi - spin operator ( @xmath83 ) rapidly decays .",
    "these behaviors indicate that the majumdar - gosh state  @xcite of the quasi - spins emerges at @xmath81 , where an energy gap appears between the magnetized states @xmath67 and @xmath84 . in this state",
    ", there is a valence - bond solid of dimers constructed by a singlet and a triplet on neighboring rungs .     and",
    "@xmath79 , with a fixed @xmath66 in a 72-rung f - qsl .",
    "the magnetization of the system is fixed at @xmath2 , and the truncation number of dmrg calculation is set on @xmath85.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]",
    "we theoretically investigate the quasi - spin correlations in the 1/2 magnetized states of the frustrated quantum spin ladder with a strong rung coupling .",
    "the effective model of these states corresponds to a frustrated spin chain with an ising anisotropy . with a weak frustration",
    ", the ground state has no gap , and is understood as a spin - liquid state , where the quasi - spin correlations decay in the power low . on the other hand , a strong frustration changes the ground state into a gapful one , where the dimer - dimer correlation of the quasi - spins retains a finite value in the infinite length limit , although the quasi - spin correlation rapidly decays . since these behaviors correspond to those of the real spins in the frustrated spin chain , we conclude that the quasi - spins in the effective model gives a valence - bond - solid picture which helps us to understand the 1/2 magnetized states with a strong frustration .",
    "this picture is not only useful to determine the critical points of the other gapless - to - gapful phase transition , but also will give a hint to understand the magnetization curve of the real compound bicu@xmath0po@xmath1 , whose effective spin model corresponds to ours .",
