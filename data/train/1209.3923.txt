    "the momentum exchange between different species plays an exceptionally important role in complex ( dusty ) plasmas  multi - component systems consisting of charged micron - sized ( `` dust '' ) grains embedded in a plasma  @xcite . in a weakly ionized plasma , the momentum transfer in collisions with the neutral gas `` cool down '' the system , in particular grains and ions , and introduce some damping .",
    "relative motion between the grains and other plasma components results in the so - called drag forces .",
    "the neutral , ion , and ( to a lesser extent ) electron drag forces are known to affect and often dominate the grain component statical and dynamical properties  @xcite .",
    "relative motion between the grain and other plasma species is not the only mechanism which can be responsible for the momentum transfer .",
    "a relevant example is the thermophoresis , which describes the phenomenon wherein small particles , suspended in a gas where a temperature gradient exists ( but macroscopic flows are absent ) , experience a force in the direction opposite to that of the gradient .",
    "elementary consideration of this phenomenon has been given by einstein  @xcite and then it was investigated in detail ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in the context of complex plasmas , jellum _",
    "et al_.  @xcite were apparently the first who recognized the possibility to manipulate the particles in gas discharges using the thermophoretic force . since then",
    ", applying the vertical temperature gradients to compensate for the particle gravity has become a standard technique for controlled particle manipulation in laboratory experiments  @xcite .",
    "in complex plasmas , the thermophoretic force has its counterparts associated with the charged electron and ion components , provided the corresponding temperature gradients are present .",
    "these electron and ion _ thermal _ forces appearing in plasmas have received much less attention than the conventional thermophoresis , or the corresponding drag forces .",
    "brook  @xcite calculated the force acting on a small _ uncharged _ particle suspended in a plasma in which temperature gradients and a magnetic field are present .",
    "gnedovets  @xcite took into account the particle charge and demonstrated that the electron and ion thermal forces can have significant effect on the particles which are smaller than the plasma screening length .",
    "nevertheless , these forces have not yet been discussed in the context of complex ( dusty ) plasmas in any reasonable detail .",
    "it seems of value , therefore , to revisit this issue with proper account of the progresses in the understanding of basic plasma - dust interactions achieved in the last two decades .    in this paper",
    "the expressions for the ion and electron thermal forces acting on a highly charged grain immersed in a weakly ionized plasma subject to temperature gradients are derived .",
    "the focus is on spherical grains , which are smaller than the plasma screening length .",
    "low collisionality is assumed , so that the mean free paths of all plasma species ( neutrals , ions , and electrons ) are long compared to the grain size , which corresponds to the limit of large knudsen number .",
    "these conditions are typical for complex plasma experiments in laboratory gas discharges .",
    "the obtained in this way expressions are simple enough and can be easily implemented for practical applications . the directions and the magnitudes of the forces",
    "are analyzed and an interesting and non - trivial behavior is reported .",
    "comparison with other forces indicates that the electron thermal force , in particular , can provide important contributions to the net force balance in typical complex plasma experiments .",
    "the general expression for the force associated with the momentum transfer from a light species @xmath1 to the massive grain at rest is @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the corresponding mass , velocity distribution function , and ( velocity dependent ) momentum transfer cross section ( @xmath6 for neutrals , ions , and electrons , respectively ) .",
    "the net momentum transfer occurs when the velocity distribution has some asymmetry ( e.g. relative motion ) . assuming weak asymmetry , we write @xmath7 , where the symmetric component @xmath8 is taken to be maxwellian @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the density and temperature ( in energy units ) of the species @xmath1 .",
    "the small asymmetric component @xmath12 , which gives contribution to the integral in ( [ mt ] ) , depends on the nature of the anisotropy . in the case of subthermal",
    "drifts with relative velocity @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) it reduces to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the thermal velocity .",
    "this ansatz corresponds to the conventional calculation of the neutral , ion and electron drag forces for subthermal flows and has been thoroughly investigated earlier  @xcite .",
    "the focus of the present paper is on a complementary situation when relative drifts are absent , but the momentum transfer do occur due to the net momentum flux caused by the temperature gradients ( if both temperature gradients and subthermal drifts are present , the corresponding thermal and drag forces are added in a simple superposition . ) in this case , the asymmetric part of the velocity distribution function of the component @xmath1 can be approximated as @xmath17{\\bf v}\\nabla t_{\\alpha},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the thermal conductivity of the species @xmath1 .",
    "this expression can be for instance derived by linearizing the kinetic equation with the bgk - like collision operator and expressing the effective collision frequency via the thermal conductivity .",
    "it is easy to check that this form ensures that the self - consistent density gradient and/or electric field ( for charged species ) , build up in response to the temperature gradient , result in no net flux : @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the fourier s law for heat transfer is also satisfied : @xmath21 .",
    "equation ( [ f1 ] ) is an approximation , which is exact only for the special case of @xmath22 interactions ( for the rigorous mathematical treatment of non - uniform gases see ref .",
    "its accuracy is , however , more than acceptable for our present purposes , especially in view of further simplifications involved in treating electron - grain and ion - grain collisions .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) into ( [ mt ] ) we get after integration over the angles in spherical coordinates @xmath23 where the remaining integration is over the reduced velocity @xmath24 . for grain - neutral collisions",
    "the momentum transfer cross section is velocity - independent , @xmath25 , and the integration yields @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the particle radius .",
    "this coincides with the celebrated expression by waldmann  @xcite for the conventional thermophoretic force .",
    "the force is directed towards lower gas temperature , because hotter atoms transfer more momentum to the grain than the colder ones .",
    "it is convenient to write the generic expression for the thermal forces in complex plasmas as @xmath28 for the neutral component ( thermophoresis ) @xmath29 .",
    "the factors @xmath30 account for the electrical interactions between the ions ( electrons ) and the charged grain .",
    "they depend on the shape of the electrical potential around the grain .",
    "we use the conventional debye - hckel ( yukawa ) form , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the grain charge and @xmath33 is the plasma screening length . in low - temperature gas discharges",
    "the dominant charging process is the continuous absorption of electrons and ions on the grain surface . in this case",
    "the charge is negative and proportional to the product of the grain radius and the electron temperature , viz .",
    "@xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the coefficient of order unity , which depends on the plasma parameter regime  @xcite . in the absence of substantial ion flows and strong nonlinearities in ion - grain interaction ,",
    "the screening length is approximately given by the ion debye radius @xmath36 , provided @xmath37 .",
    "when ion - grain interaction is strongly non - linear , the effective screening length exceeds the ion debye radius  @xcite , approximate fits are available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "although it is well recognized that the long range asymptote of the electrical potential can be modified ( by e.g. continuous plasma absorption on the grain surface  @xcite or plasma ionization / recombination effects  @xcite ) , this is expected to affect merely grain - grain interactions , but not the momentum transfer from the ions and electrons .",
    "normally , the grain radius in complex plasmas is much smaller than the plasma screening length . in this case",
    ", the electron - grain interaction can be called `` weak '' , in the sense that its range  the coulomb radius @xmath38  is much smaller than the screening length @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the coulomb scattering theory is appropriate to describe electron - grain elastic collisions .",
    "the general momentum transfer cross section for scattering in the coulomb potential @xmath39 is @xmath40^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the maximum impact parameter @xmath43 is necessary to avoid the logarithmic divergence of the cross section . in the standard coulomb scattering theory @xmath44 , and",
    "this choice is appropriate for the weak electron - grain interaction  @xcite .",
    "the minimum impact parameter @xmath45 is zero in the standard coulomb scattering theory . in the considered case , however",
    ", some electrons are falling onto the grain instead of being elastically scattered in its electrical potential .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 should be set equal to the maximum impact parameter corresponding to the electron collection by the grain , @xmath46 .",
    "the orbital motion limited ( oml ) theory yields  @xcite @xmath47 for @xmath48 and @xmath49 otherwise ( sufficiently slow electrons can not be collected even in head - on collisions with the grain due to electrical repulsion ) . the momentum transfer cross section for electron collection",
    "is simply @xmath50 .",
    "expressing now velocity in terms of @xmath51 , substituting @xmath52 into eq .",
    "( [ force ] ) and performing the integration with the appropriate limits yields : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electron - grain coulomb logarithm @xmath55 the function @xmath56 is defined as @xmath57 .",
    "equations ( [ generic ] ) , ( [ etf ] ) and ( [ ecl ] ) constitute the expression for the electron thermal force .",
    "it is similar to that obtained earlier by gnedovets  @xcite . to get",

    "( [ etf ] ) the contributions from collection and scattering are directed oppositely to each other . for a sufficiently high charge ,",
    "the scattering part becomes dominant and the force reverses direction .",
    "the physical reason is that the ( coulomb ) scattering momentum transfer cross section quickly decreases with velocity [ @xmath60 , see eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) ] , so that the cold electrons are more effective in transferring their momentum upon scattering . in this regime ( @xmath61 ) , the thermal force acts in the direction of higher electron temperature . in figure  [ fig1 ] the curve separating the positive and negative values of @xmath62",
    "is plotted in the plane ( @xmath63 , @xmath35 ) . for most experimental conditions @xmath61",
    "should be expected , although the transition line does not seem unreachable  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb radius of ion - grain interaction @xmath64 is not necessary small compared to the plasma screening length due to the presence of a ( normally ) large factor @xmath65  electron - to - ion temperature ratio  @xcite .",
    "the interaction range can exceed @xmath33 and considerable amount of momentum transfer can occur for impact parameters beyond @xmath33 .",
    "this implies that the standard coulomb scattering approach is inappropriate  @xcite .",
    "it makes sense to consider two regimes of ion scattering separately . in the regime of",
    "_ moderate ion - grain interaction _ , an extension of the standard coulomb scattering theory is possible by taking into account the momentum transfer from the ions that _ approach _ the grain closer than @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this results in @xmath66 .",
    "this approximation demonstrates good accuracy for @xmath67 and reduces to @xmath44 in the limit of weak ion - grain interaction [ @xmath68 .",
    "the impact parameter corresponding to the ion collection is @xmath69 and the corresponding collection cross section is @xmath70 . combining the contributions from collection and scattering yields : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the ( modified ) ion - grain coulomb logarithm @xmath73dx.\\ ] ] in typical complex plasmas with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , the coulomb logarithm can be roughly estimated as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the ion scattering parameter  @xcite .",
    "the approach is reliable up to @xmath80 .",
    "since the product @xmath81 is normally quite large , @xmath82 , it follows that ( i ) the scattering provides dominant contribution to the momentum transfer ; ( ii ) @xmath83 , i.e. the grains are pushed into the region with higher ion temperature .",
    "the physical reason is again fast decrease of the scattering momentum transfer cross section with the ion velocity , so that cold ions transfer more momentum to the grain .",
    "this is not a unique example when the force acting on a charged grain is directed oppositely to the net ion momentum flux .",
    "another example is related to the sign reversal of the ion drag force acting on an absorbing particle in the highly collisional ( continuum ) limit  @xcite , although the detailed physics is different .    in the regime of",
    "very _ strong ion - grain interaction _ , the scattering is characterized by the formation of a potential barrier for ions with impact parameters above the critical one @xmath84 , which considerably exceeds @xmath33 . for @xmath85 scattering with large angles",
    "occurs , which gives the major contribution to the momentum transfer .",
    "relative importance of momentum transfer from distant collisions with @xmath86 decreases rapidly with the increase in ion - grain interaction strength .",
    "the detailed consideration of the momentum transfer in this regime can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the limit @xmath87 ( i.e. @xmath88  @xcite )",
    "the total momentum transfer cross section ( collection and scattering ) can be roughly approximated as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 + 2\\ln[\\beta(v)]\\right\\}$ ] .",
    "the integration yields @xmath91dx.\\ ] ] the upper limit of integration can be chosen as @xmath92 to avoid unphysical regime of negative cross section in this approximation .",
    "however , due to the presence of the exponentially small term in @xmath56 , taking @xmath93 will not produce big errors for @xmath94 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath95 is changed from negative to positive upon increasing @xmath96 ( in the considered approximation for @xmath97 this happens at @xmath98 ; the exact value is rather sensitive to the functional dependence of the cross section on the ion velocity and , thus , is subject to significant uncertainty ) .",
    "physically , the sign reversal occurs because scattering in the yukawa potential in the limit of strong interaction tends to that on a hard sphere with the radius @xmath84 , which only weakly ( logarithmically ) depends on the ion velocity .",
    "having derived the expressions for the ion and electron thermal forces , let us discuss their relative importance .",
    "the relationship between @xmath99 and @xmath100 depends on many factors and is , in principle , arbitrary .",
    "in weakly ionized plasmas @xmath101 ( where @xmath102 is the transport cross sections for collisions with neutrals ) and the force ratio becomes @xmath103 , where the quasineutrality condition @xmath104 has been used .",
    "assuming further that most of the contribution to the thermal forces comes from elastic scattering , and setting @xmath105 for simplicity , we end up with @xmath106 for comparable temperature gradients .",
    "the first factor is small , whilst the second can be quite large , and thus various situations are possible .",
    "another situation deserving attention is when a gradient of the neutral gas temperature is created ( e.g. by heating the lower electrode of a parallel plate rf discharge ) to compensate for grain gravity ( thermophoretic levitation )  @xcite . in this case , the ion temperature is likely coupled to the neutral gas temperature , @xmath107 .",
    "the neutral and ion thermal forces are directed in the opposite directions ( in the regime of weak and moderate ion - grain coupling ) .",
    "their ratio is @xmath108 . assuming @xmath109",
    "@xcite and @xmath110 we find that @xmath100 dominates over @xmath111 for @xmath112 . for a more typical ( in laboratory gas discharges ) ionization fraction @xmath113",
    ", the ion thermal force is only slightly reducing the effect of thermophoretic force .",
    "it is worth to remind that in laboratory gas discharges , ions produced in the plasma bulk are drifting towards the walls and electrodes of the chamber .",
    "so even if some gradients of the ion temperature are present , the related effects are likely masked by the more pronounced ion drag force associated with these drifts .",
    "for example , consider the expression for the ion drag force derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the subthermal ion drift regime and weak - to - moderate ion - grain coupling , @xmath114 ( @xmath115 is the coulomb logarithm for ion scattering , which gives the dominant contribution to the ion drag force ) , along with the relation between the ion drift velocity and the electric field @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the characteristic momentum transfer frequency .",
    "the coulomb logarithms encountered in the calculations of the ion drag and ion thermal forces are not exactly the same , but are comparable @xmath118 .",
    "this results in a particularly simple estimate @xmath119 .",
    "the electric fields of the order of 1 v / cm are quite natural even for the bulk regions of gas discharges ( ambipolar fields ) .",
    "the ion temperature is normally close to the neutral gas ( room ) temperature , and thus for most situations @xmath120 is orders of magnitude less than 1 ev / cm . this implies that in the considered case @xmath121 .",
    "electrons are also drifting towards the discharge walls and electrodes .",
    "in the regime of ambipolar diffusion electron and ion fluxes are equal to each other .",
    "this implies that the electron drag force is negligible as compared to the ion drag force in this regime , due to small electron mass .",
    "however , electron temperature gradients can result in the thermal force acting on the particles .",
    "the existence of significant gradients of @xmath122 is known from earlier spatially resolved probe measurements of the electron energy distribution function in various gas discharges  @xcite . for devices used in complex plasma research , the more recent results from probe measurements  @xcite , optical emission spectroscopy  @xcite , as well as from numerical modeling  @xcite all revealed gradients in @xmath122 of the order of @xmath123(ev / cm ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of @xmath122 generally depends on discharge geometry , plasma parameters , and can be affected by the presence of grains  @xcite .",
    "let us therefore assume @xmath124 ev / cm and restrict ourselves to the comparison of the absolute magnitudes of the electron thermal force and other forces acting on a small grain in the bulk of a gas discharge .",
    "we take the plasma parameter set from ref .",
    "@xcite used to estimate relative importance of the electrical and ion drag forces : argon gas at a pressure @xmath125 pa ( @xmath126 @xmath127 ) , @xmath128 @xmath127 , @xmath129 ev , @xmath130 ev , @xmath131 @xmath132 m ( @xmath133 ) , and @xmath134 ( estimated from the collisionless oml theory ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ etf ] ) and ( [ ecl ] ) we get @xmath135 . the electron thermal conductivity in a weakly ionized plasma is @xmath136 with @xmath137 ( @xmath138 @xmath139 for @xmath140 ev in argon ) .",
    "this results in @xmath141 dyne .",
    "this force is more than three times larger than the force of gravity , experienced by the grain of this size ( and material density of @xmath142 g/@xmath143 ) in ground - based experiments .",
    "the equivalent electric field @xmath144 , for which @xmath145 , is @xmath146 v / cm .",
    "such a field would produce a significant plasma anisotropy , characterized by superthermal ion flows ( fig .",
    "4b from ref .",
    "@xcite ) . finally , this magnitude is comparable to the _ maximum _ value of the ion drag force the grain can experience in subsonic ion flows for this set of parameters ( @xmath147 dyne according to fig .",
    "4a from ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "observation of big grains , trapped in standing striations of a stratified dc glow discharge  @xcite , provides another example where the electron thermal force can play a significant role .",
    "the electron temperature is known to increase considerably in the head of the striation ( where their energy is of the order of the first excitation potential ) , which can explain that even very massive grains can be confined there  @xcite .",
    "other situations wherein plasma thermal forces may play significant role include charged aerosols , dust in planetary ( e.g. , earth ) atmospheres , fusion devices , and even quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "present results may not , however , be directly applicable to some of these cases . for example , the regime of fully ionized magnetized plasma , considered recently  @xcite , is apparently more relevant in the context of dust in fusion devices . as a final remark",
    ", we point out that complex plasmas represents a natural example where  negative thermophoresis ",
    "( force pointing towards higher temperatures ) can exists .",
    "a theoretical criterion for negative thermophoresis in dilute non - ionized gases has been discussed in a recent publication  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , the forces acting on small particles in a weakly ionized plasma subject to ion and electron temperature gradients have been analyzed with the main emphasis on applications to complex ( dusty ) plasmas .",
    "the presented estimates demonstrate that the ion thermal force is usually of minor importance in gas discharges presently employed in complex plasma research .",
    "in contrast , the electron thermal force can well be comparable to other forces acting on micron - size particles .",
    "this finding should be properly addressed when developing new ( and updating existing ) numerical codes to model particle transport in gas discharges .",
    "the expressions derived in this paper are easy for practical implementation and can serve as a theoretical basis for further detailed studies .",
