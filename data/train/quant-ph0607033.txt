    "we present a study of parametric interactions between laser pulses in a coherent ensemble of two - level quantum objects ( `` atoms '' ) .",
    "the main attention is paid to the processes that can be obtained in the strong coupling regime of light - matter interaction , which is achieved , when ( i ) the high frequency of field - matter excitation exchanges exceeds the decoherence rates , ( ii ) the external field is not strong enough to entirely determine the evolution of a system : it is the reemission field that plays a key role and provides the collective behaviour of atoms .",
    "recently , this regime has attracted attention in quantum optics with both atoms and nanostructures such as quantum wells and dots ( cavity qed , dicke effects , microcavity exciton - polariton parametric scattering , squeezing and entanglement @xcite ) . in both fields , it is considered as one of the key models for quantum information processing ( qip ) . in this context , the works on single or small number of objects ( photons , atoms , excitons ) as qubits should be mentioned @xcite .    during last years , there is a growing interest in the study of macroscopic ensembles of quantum objects , which can be used as collective elements for qip protocols @xcite .",
    "quantum memories @xcite , sources of single photons @xcite , entanglement of ensembles @xcite and new sources of entangled fields based on optically dense atomic ensembles were recently proposed .",
    "the advantages of such collective objects in contrast to single - particle qubits were highlighted @xcite .",
    "investigations of the collective effects in the strong coupling regime may be of especial importance , because in this regime , some purely quantum properties of the phenomena do not decrease with increasing number of particles @xcite , which will be important for qip with both discrete and continuous variables . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a scheme for generation of twin polaritons ( coupled light - matter excitations ) in semiconductor microcavities with quantum wells was developed .",
    "it was based on the parametric scattering of microcavity exciton - polaritons in the strong coupling regime . in this scheme",
    ", very strong quantum correlations between polaritons were obtained inside a cavity . nevertheless , since only one polariton branch of the dispersion curve was used in the parametric process proposed , quantum correlations in the outgoing light fields were essentially reduced . in this report , we present a study of parametric processes both in a cavity and free space , which arise due to collective energy exchange between field and matter systems ( i.e. , beating between two polariton branches of the dispersion curve ) @xcite .",
    "the most significant manifestation of the strong coupling regime consists in the resonant density - dependent splitting of the dispersion curve into two polariton branches .",
    "the splitting appears , when the collective coupling constant ( cooperative frequency ) of a medium @xmath0 exceeds all rates of incoherent relaxations @xmath1 :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the dipole moment and frequency of a transition , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the density and number of atoms , @xmath7 is the single - atom coupling constant .",
    "thus , in dense media , photons with equal wave vectors but different frequencies exist .",
    "if a spatial spectrum of a problem is fixed by a single - mode cavity , beating between these frequencies corresponds to vacuum rabi oscillations .",
    "a spectral doublet , arising in this case , represents density - dependent vacuum rabi splitting of a cavity mode , which is proportional to @xmath0 ( 1 ) .",
    "the origin of this effect can be traced to linear interaction of light and dipoles in a passive cavity @xcite .",
    "the condition of weak field ( which can not destroy polariton dispersion ) is reduced to the statement that the photon number is smaller then the number of atoms .    in this report",
    ", we present our results related to the strong light - matter coupling in an active system : a multimode broadband laser with an intracavity narrowband coherent resonant medium without population inversion .",
    "the condition of the strong coupling ( 1 ) can be fulfilled with respect to that macroscopic resonant absorber .",
    "a phenomenon of spectrum condensation was analysed .",
    "it consists in the dramatic modification of a lasing spectrum under transition from the weak- to strong - coupling regime of light - matter interaction : instead of usual saturated absorption line , a bright narrow doublet of generation appears .",
    "self - splitting of a dye laser spectrum at different moments of a ne discharge afterglow , which corresponds to decreasing atomic density in an intracavity cell , @xmath8 nm . ]    figure  1 presents dye laser spectra obtained with a neon discharge as an intracavity absorber at different densities @xmath5 ( up to @xmath9  @xmath10 corresponding to @xmath11 up to 10  ghz ) of neon atoms in the metastable state , which was used as a lower state of a two - level system .",
    "it was shown , that the density dependence of the doublet splitting is in agreement with that of @xmath0 ( 1 ) , which determines the vacuum rabi splitting . moreover , the the existence of a density threshold , which is also determined by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , was demonstrated . on the basis of the cooperative parametric resonance model @xcite ,",
    "this effect was treated as lasing at collective vacuum rabi sidebands due to parametric interactions between laser modes .",
    "the main difference of the free - space interaction consists in the fact that the spatial spectrum of a problem is not fixed by a cavity . as a consequence , under the linear propagation of a short pulse , no coherent density - dependent spectral features ( such as vacuum rabi splitting in a cavity )",
    "can be extracted from spectral measurements , except for the trivial appearance of an incoherent absorption line . nevertheless , in our work , we have shown that such coherent features can be obtained under nonlinear parametric interaction of laser pulses ( the details of the theory can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , experimental results are presented in ref .",
    "in contrast to cavity oscillations , they were shown to appear due to free - space optical ringing , which does not originate from beating between waves of equal wave vectors , but from the successive beats between polaritonic wave packets of equal group velocities .",
    "long coherent oscillations can be obtained due to considerable reducing of the group velocity in a dense medium and due to its essential variation over the broad spectrum of a short laser pulse .",
    "the oscillation frequency at the initial stage of the ringing @xmath12 should exceed the decoherence rates @xmath1 :      this frequency increases with propagation distance @xmath14 and medium density @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is proportional to the number of interacting atoms , which directly demonstrates the superradiant character of the field reemission by the atomic ensemble .",
    "transmission spectra of the probe field .",
    "( a ) linear transmission ( a ) and @xmath15 ( b ) , @xmath16 ; ( b ) parametric amplification at @xmath17 ( a ) and dumping at @xmath18 ( b ) for @xmath16 ; ( c ) parametric amplification at @xmath19 for @xmath20 ( a ) and for @xmath21 ( b ) ; @xmath22 , pump area @xmath23 . ]    we considered the nonlinear parametric interaction between two short laser pulses propagating in a dense resonant atomic ensemble .",
    "optical ringing was shown to significantly affect the propagation and amplification of a probe field under its interaction with a nearly copropagating pump .",
    "depending on the probe - pump time delay @xmath24 ( the probe pulse precedes the pump for @xmath25 ) , the probe transmission spectra show either a specific doublet or dip , which corresponds to parametric sideband amplification or dumping of radiation [ cf .",
    "the widths of these features are greater than the width of an incoherent absorbtion contour [ shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) ] , they are determined by the density - dependent field - matter coupling constant and increase during the propagation [ cf .",
    "2(b ) , ( c ) ] .    the spectral features in fig .",
    "2 can be explained as a result of parametric forward scattering of a probe pulse on spatiotemporal modulations of the population difference , appearing due to the optical ringing in a pump @xcite .",
    "the characteristic frequencies , which increase with the number of interacting atoms , correspond to the frequency of optical ringing .",
    "the condition of the weak fields , which do not destroy dispersion and collective behaviour of atoms , in this case , is equivalent to the requirement of the small input pulse area ( so that @xmath26 ringing should not be shadowed by 2@xmath27 solitons and rabi flopping ) .",
    "contrary to strong - field parametric processes ( e.g. , due to transient rabi flopping or stationary mollow - boyd effect , which are determined by the pump amplitude ) , the density- and coordinate - dependent spectra of the probe display the importance of free - space collective oscillations and can not be obtained in the framework of a single - atom model ."
