    "the description of correlated quantum many - body systems far from equilibrium remains one of the challenging problems in modern statistical mechanics , quantum field theory , nuclear , atomic , molecular and condensed matter physics.@xcite most of theoretical approaches are based on keldysh nonequilibrium green s functions ( negf ) which enables perturbative treatment of nonequilibrium many - body systems.@xcite negf also allows systematic summation of specific classes of nonequilibrium diagrams , for example , random phase approximation@xcite or gw theory.@xcite nonperturbative methods , such as , numerical renormalization group theory , are also available but often restricted to the oversimplified model systems.@xcite in this paper we propose a new theoretical method  nonequilibrium configuration interaction ( neci ) , which provides a nonperturbative treatment and , in principle , is able to achieve the exact solution of the nonequilibrium problem by representing the density matrix as a linear combination of nonequilibrium quasiparticle excitations above the vacuum state .",
    "let us briefly explain the main ideas of our approach .",
    "we start from the superoperator representation of the master equation for the density matrix .",
    "a summary of the superoperator formalism relevant to this work is provided in appendix a , while a detailed discussion can be found elsewhere  @xcite . in this representation nonequilibrium dynamics of many - body system",
    "is given by the schrdinger - like equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the vector in liouville - fock space , which corresponds to the density matrix , and @xmath2 is the liouville superoperator ( liouvillian ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the nonequilibrium steady - state density matrix , which is a solution of the equation @xmath3 once the equation is solved , the average of any physical operator @xmath4 can be computed according to @xmath5={\\ensuremath{\\langle{i|\\hat a|\\rho}\\rangle}}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath6 is the bra - vector in the liouville - fock space which corresponds to the unit operator  @xmath7 , and the superoperator @xmath8 is related to an operator  @xmath4 according to definition  .",
    "thus , our goal is to find the liouville - fock space vector which satisfies condition  .",
    "by the application of wick theorem in liouville - fock space@xcite the liouvillian can be brought to the normal ordered form .",
    "the diagonalization of the quadratic part in terms of nonequilibrium quasiparticles , i.e. in terms of normal modes of the uncorrelated part of the liouvillian , yields:@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are creation and annihilation superoperators for nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "the liouvillian   describes a system of nonequilibrium quasiparticles with complex spectrum @xmath12 and the quasiparticle - quasiparticle interaction @xmath13.@xcite    following the ideas of equilibrium configuration interaction method,@xcite in order to describe many - body correlations we need to specify a reference state with respect to which the correlations are defined .",
    "we choose the reference state as a vacuum for nonequilibrium quasiparticles , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "then the exact nonequilibrium density matrix can be represented a linear combination of the vacuum , two nonequilibrium quasiparticle excitations , four nonequilibrium quasiparticle excitations and so on .",
    "therefore , neci expansion for the correlated exact density matrix has the following form @xmath15 where @xmath16 contains a sum of the multi - quasiparticle creation superoperators which generate @xmath17-quasiparticle excitations above the reference state @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , etc .",
    "the relative weights ( amplitudes ) of multi - quasiparticle excitations can be found by demanding that the density matrix   satisfies the steady - state condition  ( [ lrho0 ] ) , i.e. @xmath21 this equation is equivalent to the system of inhomogeneous linear equations for the amplitudes of the density matrix expansion . to compute the average of a single - particle operator ( current , population , etc . )",
    "we need to know two - quasiparticle amplitudes . however , some truncation are to be made in the density matrix expansion for practical purposes .",
    "this results in an approximate solution of equation  .    in this paper",
    ", we develop this approach on the specific example of electron transport through a quantum system ( central region ) with electron - phonon interaction . but",
    "the method can be easily extended to an arbitrary correlated central region .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce the lindblad master equation for an embedded system and its superoperator representation .",
    "section  3 presents the nonequilibrium configuration interaction method .",
    "we discuss two different truncated expansions for the density matrix and apply the theory to calculate the steady - state current . in this section",
    ", we also proof that neci method is current conserving .",
    "the numerical neci calculations of the steady - state current and comparison with other approaches are presented in sec .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "appendix  a contains a summary of the superoperator formalism .",
    "finally , in appendix  b we provide details about negf calculations within the first born approximation and the second - order perturbation theory .",
    "we use natural units throughout the paper : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the electron charge .",
    "as shown in figure  [ system ] , we consider a paradigmatic model of nonequilibrium many - body theory : the interacting quantum system ( central region ) connected to two noninteracting electrodes , left ( @xmath2 ) and right ( @xmath24 ) , maintained with different chemical potentials , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and the same temperature @xmath27 .",
    "to be specific , we focus on the electron transport problem through one electronic single - particle level with energy @xmath28 coupled linearly to a vibrational mode ( phonon ) of frequency @xmath29 ( the so called local holstein model ) .",
    "thus , the central region hamiltonian is @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 are electron and phonon creation ( annihilation ) operators , respectively .",
    "the left and right electrodes are modeled as semi - infinite tide - binding chains of atoms characterized by the hopping matrix element @xmath34 and the on - site energy @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the coupling between the cental region and the end site of @xmath37 electrode is given by the matrix element @xmath38 .",
    "is connected to the dissipator and the central region . ]",
    "we replace the infinite system by a finite one using open boundary conditions . to this end",
    "each electrode is partitioned into two parts : the macroscopically large reservoir and the finite buffer zone between the central region and the reservoir . in doing so",
    ", the hamiltonian of the whole system takes the form @xmath39 in the energy representation the reservoir and the buffer zone hamiltonians are diagonal @xmath40 where @xmath41 denote the continuum single - particle spectra of the left ( @xmath42 ) and right ( @xmath43 ) reservoir states , while the buffer zones have discrete energy spectrum @xmath44 .",
    "the buffer - reservoir and central region - buffer couplings have the standard tunneling form : @xmath45 @xmath46    projecting out the reservoir degrees of freedom from the liouville - von neumann equation for the total density matrix , we obtain lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix of the embedded system ( central region + finite buffer zones ) @xcite @xmath47 + i{\\pi}\\rho(t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath48 is the hamiltonian of the embedded system which includes the lamb shift of the buffer zone single - particle levels @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the non - hermitian dissipator given by the standard lindblad form @xmath51 the operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 are referred to as the lindblad operators , which represent the buffer - reservoir interaction .",
    "they have the following form : @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57^{-1}$ ] _ _ _ _ and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the imaginary ( real ) part of the self - energy arising from the buffer - reservoir interaction @xmath60 .",
    "the lindblad master equation   describes the time evolution of an open embedded quantum system preserving hermiticity , normalization , and positivity of the nonequilibrium density matrix .",
    "open boundary conditions are taken into account by the non - hermitian dissipative part , @xmath61 , which represents the influence of the reservoir on the buffer zone .",
    "the applied bias potential enters into the master equation via fermionic occupation numbers @xmath62 which depend on the temperature and the chemical potential in the left and right electrodes .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that this embedding procedure makes the master equation ( [ lindblad ] ) exact in the steady - state regime , if the buffer zones are large enough to cure the deficiencies of born - markov approximation for treating the buffer - reservoir interface.@xcite    we use a superoperator formalism and convert the lindblad master equation   to the non - hermitian schredinger - like equation for the nonequilibrium density matrix.@xcite within the superoperator formalism the density matrix is considered as a vector in the liouville - fock space and all other operators as superoperators . in appendix",
    "a we present a brief summary of the formalism and demonstrate how to convert the lindblad master equation into a superoperator form .",
    "the resulting equation is @xmath63 here , the superoperators @xmath64 and @xmath65 are obtained from the hamiltonian   by replacing ordinary creation and annihilation operators @xmath66 with non - tilde , @xmath67 , and tilde , @xmath68 , superoperators , respectively ( note that we include the lamb shift into @xmath69 ) .",
    "the dissipators are given by @xmath70 the liouville superoperator @xmath2 is non - hermitian because of @xmath71 .",
    "some other important properties of @xmath2 are discussed in appendix a. in particular , the relation @xmath72 holds , where the liouville - fock space bra - vector @xmath6 corresponds to the unit operator  @xmath7 .",
    "we focus our attention on asymptotic ( @xmath73 ) nonequilibrium steady - state situation , where the density matrix @xmath74 does not depend on time .",
    "therefore the problem is reduced to the problem of finding the right zero - eigenvalue eigenvector of the non - hermitian finite - dimensional liouville superoperator @xmath75 knowing the solution of  , we can compute the steady - state current into the central region from @xmath37 buffer zone as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the current superoperator .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the development of neci method to solve equation  .",
    "we also present the application of neci to compute the steady - state current through the central region .",
    "in the beginning of the section , we make the important remark on the notation use in the rest of the paper : only creation / annihilation superoperators written with letters @xmath78 ( such as for example @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) are related to each other by the hermitian conjugation ; all other creation @xmath81 and annihilation @xmath82 superoperators ( as well as their tilde - conjugated partners ) are `` canonically conjugated '' to each other , i.e. , for example , @xmath83 does not mean @xmath84 although @xmath85 ( @xmath86 - bosons / fermions ) .",
    "let us introduce nonequilibrium quasiparticle creation and annihilation superoperators , which are the basic building blocks for the neci method .",
    "we start by decomposing the liouvillian as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the liouvillian for noninteracting electrons and phonons , @xmath89 while @xmath90 represents the interaction between them @xmath91 hereinafter , the notation t.c stands for tilde conjugated superoperators ( see the tilde - conjugation rules in appendix a ) .",
    "nonequilibrium quasiparticles are defined by diagonalizing the electronic part  of  @xmath92 : @xmath93 where @xmath94 . using the equation of motion method we find non - unitary ( but canonical )",
    "bogoliubov transformation which diagonalizes",
    "@xmath95 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 amplitudes @xmath98 , @xmath99 are the solution of the following systems of equations @xmath100 and @xmath101 with @xmath102 . by solving the eigenvalue problem",
    "we also obtain the quasiparticle spectrum @xmath103 ,  @xmath104 .    taking into account property  , we see that @xmath6 is a vacuum state for @xmath105 and @xmath106 superoperators , @xmath107    although superoperators @xmath105 and @xmath108 ( @xmath106 and @xmath109 ) are not hermitian conjugate to each other , they obey the fermionic anticommutation relations .",
    "particularly , from @xmath110 it follows that @xmath98 amplitudes are normalized according to @xmath111 other useful relations between amplitudes @xmath112 can derived by making use the transformation inverse to   ( see relations  ( a4 ) in our previous paper  @xcite ) and computing the anticommutators .",
    "for example @xmath113    to compute the steady - state curent   we need to express the current superoperator @xmath114 in terms of quasiparticle superoperators . by doing so and taking into account property  ,",
    "we obtain the following expression for the steady - state current @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the two - quasiparticle amplitude . note , that this is an _ exact _ expression for the steady - state current .",
    "the only problem is to find the unknown @xmath117 .    in the absence of electron - phonon interaction ,",
    "i.e. , when the nonequilibrium density matrix does not contain quasiparticle excitations , the current through the central region is given by the first terms in  . in what follows",
    "we will refer to this current as a free - field current  @xmath118 .",
    "the correction to the free - field current , @xmath119 , is given by the second term involving @xmath117 .",
    "in  @xcite , it was shown how to compute @xmath117 making use of the perturbation theory . in the following subsections",
    "we demonstrate how to find @xmath117 within the neci approach using different reference states for the density matrix expansion , namely , free - field and coherent reference states .",
    "we define the free - field reference state as the steady - state density matrix in the absence of electron - phonon interaction , i.e. , @xmath120 and @xmath121 the density matrix @xmath122 is a vacuum state for nonequilibrium quasiparticles , i.e. , @xmath123 to determine @xmath124 we take into account the possibility that the phonon subsystem can contain a certain number of thermally excited vibrational quanta .",
    "let @xmath125 be the number of thermally excited phonons , i.e. , @xmath126 it is convenient to perform a non - unitary canonical transformation and introduce new phonon operators @xmath127 and their tilde conjugated partners @xmath128 such that @xmath129 is the vacuum state for @xmath130 superoperators , @xmath131 while @xmath6 is the vacuum for @xmath132 superoperators ( see property   in appendix ) .",
    "now , the free - field liouvillian takes the form @xmath133 and the vacuum state @xmath18 for annihilation superoperators @xmath134 is the free - field reference state obeying condition  .",
    "the free - field density matrix @xmath135 is normalized according to @xmath136 .    due to the electron - phonon interaction",
    "the exact steady - state density matrix contains multi - quasiparticle and multi - phonon excitations above the free - field density matrix .",
    "we are looking for the exact steady - state density matrix in the form @xmath137 where the operator @xmath138 is given by the infinite power series of creation superoperators @xmath139 defined this way , the density matrix is normalized according to  @xmath140 , as @xmath6 is a vacuum for quasiparticle and phonon creation superoperators . since the density matrix is tilde - invariant ( see the definition in appendix a ) , the superoperator @xmath138 obeys the property  @xmath141  , i.e. it remains the same if we complex conjugate all @xmath142 and replace the non - tilde superoperators by the tilde ones and vice versa .",

    "any truncation in the expansion   leads to approximate solution of equation  .    here , we consider the simplest form of @xmath138 which allows us to calculate the correction for the free - field current .",

    "in our numerical calculations we assume that the applied voltage @xmath180 symmetrically shifts the on - site energies , i.e. , @xmath181 .",

    "the obtained system contains @xmath201 equations and the total number of nonzero elements is about @xmath202 . to solve the system we have used standard routines from intel mkl fortran library .        in figure  [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare the second - order perturbation theory ( sopt ) and first born approximation ( 1ba ) results for the electron current with the results obtained within neci and neci@xmath165 method for different values of the central region parameters .",
    "the currents are shown as functions of the level energy , @xmath28 , i.e. , for different transport regimes ( resonant / off - resonant ) .",
    "since the first born approximation does not guarantee the current conservation , we plot the 1ba current from the left electrode to the central region as well as the 1ba current from the central region to the right electrode .",
    "the details of sopt and 1ba calculations using nonequilibrium green s functions are presented in appendix b.    we first consider the case when @xmath203 , i.e. , there is no equilibrium thermally excited vibrational quanta . as evident from the figure in this case the first born approximation does not violate the current conservation significantly since the left and right currents are close to each other . we see that for a weak coupling ( @xmath204 ) all approaches predict a similar @xmath28 dependency of the current , which reaches a maximum value at @xmath205 .",
    "the peak value of the sopt and 1ba currents slightly exceeds the neci and neci@xmath165 ones .",
    "when we increase the electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath206 ) both sopt and neci currents become unphysical negative in the off - resonant regime when the electronic level @xmath28 is below the electrode chemical potentials . in the resonant regime sopt and neci currents significantly overestimate the results of other approaches .",
    "in addition , comparing neci@xmath165-based calculations with other calculations , we can see that neci@xmath165 approach gives the current peak position at @xmath205 .",
    "if we now consider the case of larger phonon energy ( @xmath207 ) we notice that negative sopt and neci currents in the off - resonant regime disappear and all approaches again demonstrate a similar @xmath28 dependency of the current .",
    "now we consider results obtained for nonzero number of thermally excited equilibrium vibrational quanta .",
    "namely , we assume that @xmath208 . in this case",
    "the first born approximation clearly reveals its current nonconserving nature .",
    "this is illustrated in the lower panels of figure  [ fig2 ] where we can see that the left and right 1ba currents can be very different from each other .",
    "nevertheless , in the weak electron - phonon coupling regime ( @xmath204 ) , all approached predict qualitatively similar dependence of the current upon the electronic level @xmath28 . comparing the result for @xmath204 , @xmath208 with those for @xmath209 , @xmath203 we notice that inclusion of thermally excited equilibrium vibrational quanta into consideration produces slightly broadened current peak with a reduced amplitude . when the coupling constant increases ( @xmath206 ) sopt and neci approaches again show unphysical negative current in the off - resonant regime when @xmath28 is below the electrode chemical potentials .",
    "moreover , for @xmath206 the electron - phonon coupling splits the neci@xmath165 current peak , while neci approach gives only one peak . for a larger phonon energy , @xmath210 ,",
    "neci@xmath165 predicts three pronounced peaks , while neci gives only two peaks .",
    "in addition , sopt and 1ba show unphysically negative current for certain values of @xmath28 .    from the above consideretion",
    "it is evident that the configuration interaction method built on the coherent reference state is preferable when the electron - phonon coupling is large or when there are thermally excited vibrational quanta in the system .",
    "this result is not surprising since , contrary to neci , neci@xmath165 method accounts for multi - photon excitations and de - excitation processes which are important in these regimes .",
    "we developed nonequilibrium configuration interaction method , which formally gives the exact solution of out - of - equilibrium correlated many - body problem .",
    "our approach is based on a superoperator representation of the lindblad master equation for the reduced density matrix of the embedded quantum system .",
    "it was shown that the steady - state density matrix can be decomposed in liouville - fock space in terms of nonequilibrium multi - quasiparticle excitations above the reference vacuum state .",
    "the amplitudes of these excitations provide a measure of the many - body nonequilibrium correlations .",
    "the theory was applied to study the inelastic electron transport through the system with electron - phonon interaction . to compute the current we used truncated expansion of the steady - state density matrix .",
    "two different reference states were considered : free - field vacuum and coherent state .",
    "it was proved that both approximations are current conserving in all orders of the density matrix expansion .",
    "the current through the system was computed for different model parameters and compared with the second - order perturbation theory and the first born approximation results .",
    "it was shown that the configuration interaction method based on the coherent reference state is superior to the other approaches when the electron - phonon coupling is large or when there are thermally excited vibrational quanta in the system .",
    "the method can be readily extended to dynamical nonequilibrium case by making the amplitudes in the density matrix expansion time - dependent functions .",
    "here we briefly review the formalism of superoperators acting in the liouville - fock space , while the detailed discussion is given in  @xcite .",
    "we suppose that the fock space of the system under consideration is spanned by the complete orthonormal set of basis vectors @xmath211 which are eigenvectors of the particle number operator : @xmath212 the operators in the fock space form themselves a linear vector space called the liouville - fock space .",
    "the set of vectors @xmath213 constitutes a orthonormal basis in the liouville - fock space .",
    "thus , every fock space operator @xmath214 can be considered as a liouville - fock space ket - vector @xmath215 .",
    "the adjoint operator @xmath216 is represented by the bra - vector  @xmath217 .    the scalar product in the liouville - fock space is defined as @xmath218 . in particular , the scalar product of a vector @xmath219 with @xmath6 is equivalent to the trace operation in the fock space , @xmath220 .",
    "now we introduce creation and annihilation superoperators .",
    "fermion creation and annihilation superoperators are defined as @xmath221 where @xmath222 . for bosonic creation and annihilation superoperators",
    "we drop the phase factor @xmath223 .",
    "so defined superoperators satisfy the same ( anti)commutation relations as their fock space counterparts . additionally , the basis vectors of the liouville - fock space are super - particle number eigenvectors , i.e. , @xmath224    for an operator @xmath225 we formally define two superoperators @xmath226 and refer to them as non - tilde and tilde superoperators , respectively .",
    "the connection between non - tilde and tilde superoperators is given by the `` tilde conjugation rules '' @xmath227    with the help of superoperators an arbitrary liouville - fock space vector can be represented as @xmath228 hereinafter , the phase @xmath229 if @xmath4 is a fermionic operator and @xmath230 if @xmath4 is a bosonic operator .",
    "we also define a liouville - fock space vector tilde conjugated to a given one , @xmath231 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath4 is a hermitian bosonic operator then @xmath219 is tilde - invariant , i.e. , @xmath232 .",
    "the examples of tilde - invariant vectors are @xmath233 and the density matrix @xmath234 .    considering the adjoint of   and assuming that @xmath235 we find @xmath236 this gives us the idea introduce superoperator @xmath237 and its tilde conjugate , @xmath238 , which annihilate the bra - vector @xmath6 .    for the product of operators",
    "the following relation is valid @xmath239 where @xmath240 if both @xmath241 and @xmath242 are fermionic and @xmath243 otherwise . with the help of relations   the average of an operator @xmath4 in the state with the density matrix @xmath244",
    "can be calculated as the matrix element of the corresponding superoperator @xmath8 sandwiched between @xmath6 and @xmath245 : @xmath246    let us now consider the lindblad master equation",
    ". in the liouville - fock space this equation takes the form @xmath247 applying raltions  , i.e. , taking into account that @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , etc .",
    ", we can rewrite this equation in the schrdineger - like form  .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix is governed by the non - hermitian liouville superoperator @xmath2 .",
    "two important properties of @xmath2 should be noted : 1 . since",
    "the density matrix is tilde invariant , then @xmath251 ; 2 .",
    "taking the time derivative of @xmath252 we find @xmath253 , i.e. , @xmath6 is the left zero - eigenvalue eigenvector of @xmath2 .",
    "in this appendix we briefly describe the details of transport calculations based on nonequilibrium green s functions relevant to our discussion . we first define four kind of interacting green s functions : @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
