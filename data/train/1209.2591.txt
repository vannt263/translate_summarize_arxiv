    "during the last twenty years , a dozen of young ( @xmath4500 myr ) nearby ( @xmath4200 pc ) associations ( or co - moving stellar groups ) have been identified ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although numerous kinematical studies have confirmed their existence , their origin and evolution remain still unclear ( see @xcite , and references therein ) . representing valuable laboratories to investigate the recent star formation in the solar vicinity , the measurement and study of their chemical composition are important to put constraints on their origin and evolutionary history , but also for the exo - planetary research . on one side , elemental abundances of @xmath5-elements ( but also iron - peak elements ) in young associations can provide evidence of recent local enrichment ; on the other side , since planets are assumed to form from circumstellar discs during the pre - main sequence phase , obvious questions arise on what the metallicity of young solar analogs and what fraction of them ( if any ) is metal - rich ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "yet , so far , only a few studies have been focused on the determination of elemental abundances in such stellar groups ( see section [ sec : obs ] ) .",
    "many studies have shown that giant gaseous planets are preferentially found around main - sequence solar - type stars more metal - rich than the sun ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in particular , the frequency of giant planets around stars of twice the solar metallicity is around 30% , in contrast to the @xmath6% for stars with solar or sub - solar iron content ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a trend seems to have a primordial / basic origin ( @xcite ) , but presents several caveats .",
    "first , giant stars hosting planets do not appear on average more metal - rich than stars without planets ( @xcite ) , and this could hint that stellar mass strongly influences the planet formation process ( @xcite ) .",
    "second , the trend is no longer valid for iron abundances ranging from [ fe / h]=@xmath7 to [ fe / h]=@xmath8 dex ( @xcite ) .",
    "third , the nature of such a trend in the early stages of planet formation is still unknown . regarding the latter point ,",
    "the dispersal efficiency of circumstellar ( or proto - planetary ) discs , the planet birthplace , is predicted to depend on metallicity ( @xcite ) . in a recent study ,",
    "@xcite have found that the disc fraction in significantly low - metallicity clusters ( [ o / h]@xmath9 ) declines much faster ( in @xmath10  myr ) than observed in solar - metallicity clusters ( i.e. in @xmath11 myr ) .",
    "they suggest that , as the shorter disc lifetime reduces the time available for planet formation , this could be one of the reasons for the strong planet - metallicity connection .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the abundances of 11 elements ( lithium , iron - peak , @xmath5 , and other odd-/even- z elements ) in 13 f6k2 main - sequence stars belonging to the young associations ab  doradus , carina near , and ursa major .",
    "the case of @xmath0horologii ( a young exoplanet - host star ) is also investigated .",
    "some of these associations were already studied in terms of some elemental abundances by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but no effort has been done to widely characterise their chemical content . recently , in a companion paper , we have reported the @xmath12-process element ( yttrium , zirconium , lanthanum , cerium , and barium ) abundance determination of the same targets in our sample ( with the only exception of hip36414 ) , with the aim to investigate possible over - abundances ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have found that while y , zr , la , and ce exhibit solar ratios , ba is over - abundance by @xmath130.2 dex ; we have hence exploited effects related to the stratification in temperature of model atmospheres , nlte corrections , and chromospheric - related effects as possible explanations for this scenario .",
    "thus , the study of @xcite and the present complementary work represent the first efforts done to systematically derive many elemental abundances in young associations .    a brief overview of previous investigations in the selected young associations is given in the following of this section .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] presents the selection of the stellar sample and observations .",
    "abundance analysis techniques are described in section  [ sec : abundance ] , while the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the ab  doradus ( hereafter , ab  dor ) stellar group was first postulated by @xcite in the sacy ( search for associations containing young stars ) project with the designation of ana , and then identified by @xcite as the co - moving youthful ( @xmath14 myr ) group closest to earth . they also claimed its nucleus is a clustering of a dozen f  m type members @xmath15 pc from earth that includes the ultra - rapid rotator , active binary star ab  dor .",
    "@xcite argued that the ab  dor association is a remnant of the large - scale star formation event that formed the pleiades , and estimated an age of 75150 myr ( this older age was also confirmed by @xcite ) .",
    "the common origin of the ab  dor and the pleiades associations has been later reinforced by @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented the 89 high - probable members of ab  dor , of which 29 are binaries , and derived a distance of @xmath16 pc and an age of 70 myr .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite found other likely members of the ab  dor group , which include early - type stars , an m dwarf triple system , and three very cool objects .",
    "the carina near association was identified by @xcite as a group of about 20 co - moving 200@xmath350  myr old stars , where all but three are plausible members of multiple stellar systems .",
    "the nucleus , at @xmath1330 pc from earth , seems to be farther than the surrounding stream stars , and is located in the southern hemisphere and coincidentally quite close to the nucleus of the ab  dor group , notwithstanding that the two groups have different ages and galactic space motions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ursa major ( hereafter , uma ) association in the big dipper constellation is located at a distance of @xmath1325 pc .",
    "it includes @xmath14 most probable members placed across almost the whole northern sky that move toward a common convergent point .",
    "the age estimates range widely from 200  myr to 600  myr ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the young exoplanet - host star @xmath0horologii ( @xcite ) has been studied by many authors during the last decade , in particular for the implications on theories of stellar and planetary formation and possible relationship with metallicity .",
    "it belongs to the hyades stream ( @xcite ) , which is composed by field - like stars ( 85% ) and stars evaporated from the primordial hyades cluster ( 15% ) .",
    "recent asteroseismic studies suggest that @xmath0hor was formed within the primordial @xmath17myr - old hyades cluster and then evaporated toward its present location , 40pc away ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the same studies show that the metallicity , helium abundance , and age are similar to those of the hyades cluster .",
