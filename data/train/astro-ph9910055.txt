    "in the last decade the study of the evolution of the qso luminosity function and of the clustering properties of qsos has been based on statistical analysis of even larger qso catalogues . for redshifts",
    "lower than 2.2 the color techniques provide good selection methods .",
    "now days the qso luminosity function evolution at @xmath3 is well established ( e.g. la franca & cristiani 1997 , goldschmidt & miller 1998 ) .",
    "this kind of studies are mainly based on the most statistically significant qso samples such us the durham / aat qso sample ( boyle et al . 1990 ) at faint magnitudes ( @xmath4 ) , and the bright qso survey ( schmidt & green 1983 ) , the large bright qso survey ( hewett et al .",
    "1995 ) , the edinburgh uvx qso survey ( goldschmidt et al . 1992 , miller et al . in prep ) , the homogeneous bright qso survey ( hbqs , cristiani et al .",
    "1995 ) at bright magnitudes ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in total these samples collect about a thousand of qsos with @xmath3 .",
    "but these samples are still not ideally suited to study the qso clustering and its evolution ( see andreani & cristiani 1992 ) .",
    "the best qso samples for clustering analysis should have the highest possible surface densities and cover a contiguous areas , such as the planned qso 2df redshift survey ( croom et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio in the estimate of the clustering of qsos",
    ", we have built a new sample of 429 qsos down to @xmath6 over a contiguous area of 24.6 deg@xmath1 .",
    "this sample has allowed the measure of a difference on the qso clustering evolution in comparison with that found for galaxies ( la franca et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the survey is located in the south galactic pole ( sgp ) region , where some of the durham / aat sample areas are included ( boyle et al .",
    "1990 ) , and part of the high - redshift qso survey of warren et al .",
    "( 1991b ) was carried out .",
    "the region has been also studied by campusano ( 1991 ) .",
    "the central area of 1.7 deg@xmath1 in our region has been covered by the eso imaging survey in the b , v and i band ( eis , da costa 1998 , nonino et al .",
    "1999 , prandoni et al . 1999 ,",
    "zaggia et al . 1999 ) . the acquisition of the corresponding u data is planned for 1999 .",
    "further deep multicolor imaging over an area of about half a sq.deg .",
    "is planned with the wfi at the eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "moreover about 10 deg@xmath1 of the southern area of the region is included in the 2df qso redshift survey ( croom et al .",
    "our survey is based on a set of ukst plates in the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 bandpass ( see blair & gilmore ( 1982 ) for a definition of the various systems ) .",
    "ukst plates subtend @xmath10 .",
    "details of the photographic plate material are listed in table 1 .",
    "the plates have been scanned in mapping and imaging mode on the cosmos microdensitometer ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mapping mode used a spot size of 16 @xmath11 m ( fwhm ) , corresponding to 1 arcsec . for each band - pass the digitized mapping mode data have been added together in order to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the reliability of the co - adding technique has been verified by many tests on ukst plates ( hawkins 1991 ) .",
    "the resulting coadded digitized data has been analyzed by the cosmos crowded - field analysis software ( beard et al .",
    "the resulting tables contained the instrumental magnitudes , the area above the threshold , the intensity weighted @xmath12 and @xmath13 positions , and other useful parameters .",
    "we discriminated between point - like and extended sources using the cosmos image parameters , that is , on morphological grounds .",
    "we defined a plane in which stellar locus was well determined , and drew the separation line near the locus .",
    "for typically @xmath14 , we used the log(isophotal area ) versus magnitude plane . at fainter magnitudes , where stellar peak surface brightness ( @xmath15 ) are not saturated , the log@xmath16 versus magnitude plane provided a better separation .",
    "the two separation lines produced the same star - galaxy ratio at the overlap magnitude .",
    "relative photometry , using instrumental magnitudes , was produced by cosmos .",
    "calibration was based on published sequences ( hawkins & bessell 1988 , @xcite ) .",
