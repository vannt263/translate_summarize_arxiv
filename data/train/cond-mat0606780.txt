    "magnetic frustration is believed to be the major tool to drive a two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum antiferromagnet ( af ) into exotic quantum disordered su(2)-symmetric phases such as the spin liquid ( sl ) state characterized by the absence of ordering of any kind , and possibly observed in the 2d kagome lattice  @xcite . the valence bond crystal ( vbc ) which , in contrast , breaks lattice symmetry ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vbc ] for pictures of such states ) , seems to be a serious alternative in some other frustrated quantum magnets as suggested by robust field theoretical arguments  @xcite , early numerical computations of frustrated quantum af on the square lattice with diagonal @xmath0 bonds  @xcite and in the 2d checkerboard lattice  @xcite ( with diagonal bonds only on half of the plaquettes ) .",

    "the ground state is 4-fold degenerate .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 couplings ( depicted on figure ( b ) ) are shown to stabilize the plaquette phase . ]",
    "the `` deconfined critical point '' ( dcp ) was recently proposed to describe a new class of quantum criticality characterizing the af to vbc transition  @xcite . here",
    "we argue that the two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin-1/2 af @xmath2-@xmath0-@xmath1 heisenberg model  @xcite on the square lattice defined by @xmath3 where the @xmath4 exchange parameters are limited to first ( @xmath2 ) , second ( @xmath0 ) and third ( @xmath1 ) n.n .",
    "af couplings is a strong candidate for exhibiting such a transition .",
    "recent investigations of this model along the pure @xmath1 axis  @xcite or for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 finite  @xcite provide an accumulation of evidence in favor of the existence of a vbc phase with strong plaquette correlations similar to the cartoon of fig .  [",

    "dimer - dimer correlations ( not shown ) reveal a strong signal of vbc order of some kind .",
    "summing up these spatial correlations with appropriate phase factors provides quantitative estimates of both the  generic  vbc and the  specific  columnar vbc structure factors ( normalized to give the squares of the corresponding order parameters ) .",
    "such estimates are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_factors ] ; the upper line is obtained by an extrapolation to infinite size of the dimer structure factor constructed by summing up the correlations of the horizontal dimers ( only ) with an alternating sign along columns ( in order to provide a signal for all types of vbc phase ) . clearly , a large vbc order parameter is seen with a value close to the one of a pure plaquette phase ( dotted line ) , at leat close to the pure @xmath1 axis .",
    "the data sets at the bottom are obtained by summing up the dimer correlations with opposite sign for vertical and horizontal dimers ( also omitting the short distance contributions ) to filter the signal of columnar order only .",
    "the small values of the latter data strongly suggest that the vbc order is a plaquette order rather than a columnar order .",
    "note , however , that the vbc signal weakens significantly when approaching the pure @xmath0 axis .",

    "we shall now test the properties of the plaquette vbc by removing an electron at a given site ( e.g. by chemical substitution with an inert atom ) or , as in arpes experiments , in a bloch state of given momentum .",
    "this process naturally liberates a spinon , i.e. a s=1/2 polarisation in the vicinity of the empty site ( holon ) .",
    "a new length scale @xmath10 corresponding to the average distance between vacancy and spinon emerges naturally in a vbc phase and is to be identified with the correlation length over which vbc order sets in .",

    "the obtained very short magnetic correlation length @xmath11 , below one lattice spacing , is to be contrasted with the strikingly large _ confinement _ length @xmath10 typically ranging from 2 to 6 lattice spacings .",
    "this is to be compared with two other behaviors observed in the kagome and in the checkerboard lattices  @xcite respectively : in the checkerboard lattice ( whichalso exhibits a plaquette phase but a larger spin gap  @xcite ) very short - ranged spin - spin correlations are seen while the spinon remains almost entirely confined on the n.n .",

    "the quasiparticle weight z can be deduced from the computation of the single hole green function .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] shows that it is clearly reduced in the vicinity of the j2+j3 = j1/2 line where evidence for a plaquette vbc phase was found .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with the above real - space picture which naturally implies that the extended spinon wavefunction of size @xmath10 has a reduced overlap @xmath5 with the bare wavefunction ( of extension @xmath11 ) . when the vacancy is given some kinetic energy ( through a n.n .",
    "hopping as in the well - known t - j model ) , the @xmath5 factor of the hole drops further to very small values  @xcite showing that the hole motion strongly suppresses the effect of the remaining spinon - holon vbc string potential  @xcite .",
    "typical spectral functions along the pure j3 line are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectral2 ] .",
    "note that a _ complete _ deconfinement was shown for a mobile hole on the kagome lattice  @xcite as evidenced by a fully incoherent spectral weight at low energies .",
    "lastly , we would liketo comment on the possibility of superconducting pairing upon doping vbc s .",
    "in fact , pairing driven by a kinetic energy gain of the cooper pair was discovered in the robust plaquette phase of the checkerboard lattice  @xcite . on general grounds",
    ", one would also expect hole pairing in the doped j@xmath16-j@xmath17-j@xmath18 quantum antiferromagnet due to the long distance confining string of the vbc .",

    "note that for @xmath21 the main low energy peak contains several poles in contrast to the @xmath22 case where a single pole is present . ]",
    "to conclude , the confinement of a spinon liberated by introducing a vacant site or a mobile hole has been studied in the j@xmath16-j@xmath17-j@xmath18 model where a plaquette vbc phase has been identified in some extended region of the phase diagram . in this region of large frustration , we have identified a new length scale related to the confinement of the spinon .",
