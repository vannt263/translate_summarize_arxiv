    "@xcite for recent bottom quark mass extractions from spectral moments in semileptonic b - decays . )    in general , one can distinguish between two regions in @xmath9 , which require a different theoretical treatment . for low values of @xmath9",
    "the moments are dominated by relativistic dynamics and scales of order of the heavy quark mass @xmath10 .",
    "this allows the use of the usual expansion in the number of loops for the theoretical computations , and the @xmath0 scheme is an appropriate choice for the heavy quark mass parameter .",
    "however , the lack of data for @xmath11 in the continuum regions above the quarkonium resonances introduces model - dependent errors that have not been quantified in most of the previous analyses .",
    "( see refs.@xcite for recent reviews . ) on the other hand , for large values of @xmath9 the continuum regions are suppressed and the moments become dominated by the quarkonium resonance region where good sets of data have been obtained in the past .",
    "however , the theoretical predictions of moments for large values of @xmath9 is more complicated since the usual loop expansion breaks down and the size of non - perturbative effects increases . here",
    ", summations of higher order contributions proportional to powers of @xmath12 need to be carried out in order to capture the relevant non - relativistic perturbative information@xcite , and so - called threshold masses  @xcite are appropriate schemes for the heavy quark mass parameter .",
    "moreover , there is an upper `` duality '' bound for the possible choices of @xmath9 since the energy range contributing to the moments , which is of order @xmath13 , needs to be larger than the typical hadronization scale @xmath14.@xcite in the case of @xmath15 and the determination of the bottom mass , this bound is around @xmath16 , and the two ranges in @xmath9 are believed to be well separated with their boundary being approximately at @xmath17 .",
    "a good number of analyses exists for small and large values of @xmath9 and respecting the cancellation of the dominant renormalon contributions associated to the choice of the quark mass definition.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite for an early analysis using the @xmath0 bottom quark mass for larger values of @xmath9 . )    for @xmath18 and the determination of the charm mass , the distinction between large- and low-@xmath9 moments is more delicate because @xmath19 is not much larger than @xmath20 . here",
    ", the upper duality bound for @xmath9 is around @xmath21 or @xmath22 .",
    "this leaves basically no space at all to carry out the non - relativistic summations that can be applied in the bottom quark case because the corresponding techniques are only valid for large @xmath9 and as long as @xmath13 is larger than @xmath20 . on the other hand , even for @xmath23 the non - relativistic region close to the @xmath24 threshold can have a considerable contribution to the moments , while the model - dependences from the experimentally unknown continuum region can still be significant . for a reliable ( error )",
    "analysis these issues need to be taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we determine the @xmath0 charm quark mass @xmath25 from moments @xmath26 with @xmath23 using the usual loop expansion in powers of @xmath27 . in a previous work  @xcite an error of less than 30  mev was obtained using results at order @xmath2 and a fixed renormalization scale @xmath28 between @xmath19 and @xmath29 .",
    "this analysis assumed that the moments are dominated by scales of order @xmath19 . in our analysis",
    "we focus on the theoretical uncertainties coming from the low - energy region close to the @xmath24 threshold .",
    "it is well known that close to threshold , where the c.m .",
    "velocity @xmath30 of the quarks is small , the dominant perturbative contributions to @xmath18 are in fact governed by renormalization scales of the order of the relative quark momentum , @xmath31.@xcite we believe that this effect should not be ignored in determinations of the charm quark mass since it accounts for important higher - order information .",
    "it is the main aim of this work to study the impact of these higher - order contributions . in particular",
    ", we find that they affect the estimate of the theoretical error .",
    "we also carry out a careful study of all sources of uncertainties including the continuum regions where no data is available .",

    "the first error is statistical and the second systematical .",
    "the results are only given for the second and the third theoretical method , as the first and second methods yield very similar results , particularly for @xmath59 .",
    "this is expected since the high - energy range , @xmath60 , where the renormalization scales of the two methods differ , is suppressed .",
    "the uncertainties from experimental data and from the treatment of the non - perturbative corrections are similar for the three theoretical methods . as mentioned before",
    ", the model - dependent error coming from the lack of experimental data in the continuum region is negligible for @xmath59 and amounts to only about 10  mev for @xmath61 .",
    "this is in contrast to determinations of @xmath62 where the model - dependent error is significantly larger , particularly for @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite the uncertainties coming from the error in @xmath64 for @xmath59 are larger for the third method than for the first and the second one , since variations in the value of @xmath64 have a larger impact at lower scales .",
    "to obtain combined errors we have added all statistical uncertainties in quadrature , and all other uncertainties linearly .",
    "since the statistical errors are smaller than the other sources of uncertainties , the reader should note that our total errors can not be interpreted statistically .",
    "it is instructive to have a closer look onto the perturbative uncertainties obtained by the different theoretical methods .",
    "for all methods the uncertainties obtained by varying @xmath47 either in the range @xmath65 or @xmath46 become smaller for larger values of @xmath9 .",
    "this behavior is , however , less pronounced for the third method .",
    "thus , each of the methods yields a behavior in contrast to the expectation that the scaling uncertainties grow like the uncertainties from the non - perturbative corrections , since for larger @xmath9 the moments become dominated by dynamics at lower energies . on the other hand , comparing the results for the central values obtained by the three theoretical methods it is found that they tend to decrease for larger values of @xmath9 for the first and second method , while there is the opposite effect for the third method .",
    "in fact , the difference between the central values for @xmath59 is larger than the uncertainties based on varying @xmath47 .",
    "this feature is related to the different treatment of higher - order contributions and appears to be similar to the discrepancies found between the `` contour - improved '' and the `` fixed - scale '' approaches for predictions of the hadronic @xmath66-decay rate .",
    "( see e.g. refs.@xcite for discussions on this issue ) .",
    "interestingly , the convergence behavior of the moments for all three methods is quite good .",
    "for example , for @xmath67 , @xmath68  gev , @xmath69 and @xmath70 one obtains ( in units of @xmath71  gev@xmath72 ) @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for the perturbative expansion of the moment for the first , second and the third method , respectively .",
    "the discrepancy between the first two methods and the third one is considerably larger than an error estimate based on the size of the order @xmath2 terms obtained from each of the methods .",
    "these discrepancies represent theoretical uncertainties that are not captured by conventional variations in the renormalization scale .",
    "however , they should be included in the estimate of the theoretical error .",
    "we include this type of theoretical uncertainty in our procedure to determine the combined results shown in tab.[tabmcfinal ] .    as our final result",
    "we adopt @xmath76 obtained from our fits using the moments for @xmath77 .",
    "they are sufficiently below the duality bound and , at the same time , have only small sensitivity to the continuum region above the @xmath50 resonance .",
    "our result is compatible with earlier analyses based on moments of @xmath18  @xcite , and with recent lattice determinations  @xcite as well as with the finite energy sum rule analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , our error is much larger than in refs.@xcite due to our more pertinent treatment of theoretical and experimental uncertainties . on the other hand , the size of our error is comparable to refs.@xcite where summations of terms proportional to powers of @xmath12  @xcite were partially included to account for non - relativistic effects in the low - energy region @xmath78 .",
    "however , the resulting central values are systematically lower than ours by up to @xmath79  mev .",
    "this effect apparently arises from the summation of the higher order terms just mentioned and from the use of moments for @xmath80 .",
    "both issues are problematic from the conceptual point of view .",
    "the size of our error is also comparable to the analysis of ref.@xcite , but our central value is about @xmath79  mev lower .",
    "this discrepancy seems to indicate that there is a systematic difference between the sum rules based on eq.([momdefcomplex ] ) and the finite energy moments employed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we note , however , that the strong influence of systematic errors in the derivation of the non - charm r ratio @xmath81 and possible ambiguities in the choice of the upper energy cut - off represent sources of uncertainties for the finite energy sum rule approach that are not easy to quantify .",
    "based on the numbers given in tabs.[tabmcfinal ] and [ tabmcerrors ] it is straightforward to discuss how the uncertainty in @xmath41 might be further reduced in the future .",
    "one improvement could be achieved by the computation of the order @xmath82 corrections to the moments  if they indeed lead to a reduction of the discrepancies between `` contour - improved '' and `` fixed - scale '' predictions .",
    "at present the theoretical uncertainty coming from the different ways to implement the renormalization scale amounts to about @xmath83 to @xmath84  mev .",
    "the uncertainties coming from the @xmath49 @xmath3-partial width , from the error in @xmath27 and from the treatment of non - perturbative effects are each at the level of @xmath85  mev . for the combination of these uncertainties a reduction of up to @xmath86  mev appears possible for an improved measurement of the @xmath3-partial width and if smaller uncertainties in the determinations of the strong coupling are achieved . on the other hand , improvements in the data for @xmath50 and for the @xmath24 continuum will not improve the situation significantly .",
    "we have also applied our method to estimate the theoretical uncertainties for determinations of @xmath87 from low-@xmath9 moments of @xmath15 . using the approach described above we find @xmath88  gev .",
    "the error is only @xmath89  mev larger than the error obtained from an earlier analysis by one of the authors which was based only the first method with an energy - independent renormalization scale .",
    "this shows that the scale choice @xmath90 has a smaller impact in the bottom quark case due to its larger mass .",
