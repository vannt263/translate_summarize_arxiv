    "@xmath1 violation ( cpv ) is one of the most important features in particle physics . in the standard model ( sm )",
    ", it arises from a unique physical phase of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of cpv remains unclear . on the other hand",
    ", it is unknown whether cpv also occurs in the lepton sector .",
    "in general , there are two possible sources of cpv : complex couplings of the yukawa interactions and complex vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the scalar fields , which explicitly and spontaneously break @xmath1 symmetry , such as the cases of the sm and multi - higgs doublet models   @xcite , respectively .",
    "recently , a new spontaneous @xmath1 violation mechanism has been proposed by friedberg and lee @xcite .",
    "they introduced a gauge singlet pseudoscalar which couples to quarks to yield a new type of yukawa interactions .",
    "as the yukawa couplings are assumed to be real , the system is @xmath1 and @xmath2 conserving .",
    "once the pseudoscalar acquires a vev , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are spontaneously broken .",
    "the excitation of the pseudoscalar from its vacuum predicts a new neutral scalar field named as `` timeon '' .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the proposal is that the pseudoscalar is also responsible for the masses of up and down quarks , but not for the heavy quarks . as a result ,",
    "the timeon mass and the vev can be much lower than electroweak scale .    the timeon model , however , has a potential problem of flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) mediated by the timeon . as we shall explain later , the timeon mass is strongly constrained by the mass mixings of the neutral mesons and must be much larger than its vev .",
    "this fact implies the strongly interacting quartic timeon coupling and the broken down of the perturbation . in this paper , in order to save the model , we introduce a small parameter @xmath3 and re - define the vev as @xmath4 .",
    "we will demonstrate that the small @xmath3 can relax the phenomenological constraints , which permit a much smaller mass of the timeon .",
    "we would also extend the timeon model to the lepton sector and explore leptonic fcnc processes , such as the lepton number violating decays and the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we give a brief review of the timeon model and calculate the mixing parameters in the neutral meson systems . in sec .",
    "3 , we extend the timeon model to the lepton sector .",
    "we present the summary in sec .",
    "in the theory of timeon , proposed by friedberg and lee  @xcite , the quark mass hamiltonian is written as @xmath5_{ij}u_j          + \\bar{d}_i[g_d + i\\gamma_5   \\tau_0 f]_{ij}d_j \\nonumber\\\\   & = & \\bar{u}_{li}[g_u + i \\tau_0 f]_{ij}u_{rj }          + \\bar{d}_{li}[g_d + i \\tau_0 f]_{ij}d_{rj }          + h.c.\\ , \\label{eq : quark}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constant @xmath6 is the vev of the new @xmath1 odd and @xmath2 odd , gauge singlet pseudoscalar field @xmath7 , @xmath8 stand for family indices and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 matrices , given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the real parameters of @xmath14 and @xmath15 and two angles of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 and @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gq ] ) can be also defined by four angles as @xmath19 the potential of the pseudoscalar field is given by  @xcite @xmath20 which leads to the mass of the new quantum , @xmath21 , timeon , to be @xmath22 as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gq ] ) , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and thus up and down quarks of the first generation are massless before @xmath7 receives the vev .",
    "after @xmath7 gets the vev , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are spontaneously broken and the first generation quarks acquire small masses . note that since the timeon is not responsible for the masses of heavy quarks , its vev can be much lower than the electroweak scale .      in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was estimated that @xmath25 , which implies that @xmath26 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt ] ) if @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the mass of the timeon is much lower than the electroweak scale .",
    "however , a light timeon could give rise to dangerous fcnc processes because in general @xmath28 and @xmath10 can not be diagonalized simultaneously .",
    "in fact , in the mass eigenstate basis of quarks , flavor changing timeon couplings are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the unitary matrices to diagonalize up and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    ".values of parameters used in the calculation . here",
    ", we have used the same quark masses as those in ref .",
    "@xcite , while the decay constants and the meson masses are the center values in ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the values in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fu ] ) and inputs in table [ tab : para ] , the mass mixing parameter in the neutral @xmath32 meson system due to the timeon contribution at tree level is estimated to be @xmath33 from the experimental data of @xmath34 , without loss of generality we find the lower limit of the timeon mass as @xmath35 which is much higher than that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt0 ] ) . here",
    ", we have ignored the renormalization group effects as well as some hadronic uncertainties .",
    "we note that the mixing parameters in other neutral meson systems also lead to similar constraints on @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , in the timeon model of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath37 , which requires the strongly interacting quartic timeon coupling , @xmath21 , @xmath38 .",
    "in order to solve the problem , in this paper , we introduce a small dimensionless parameter @xmath3 for the terms related to @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : quark ] ) , which is equivalent to a re - defined vev of @xmath39 if @xmath3 is very small , the constraints from the fcnc processes can be relaxed becouse the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mt1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath40 . in this case",
    ", the constraint from @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 by assuming that @xmath43 , @xmath21 , @xmath44 , we obtain that @xmath45 from eq . ( [ eq : vev2 ] ) .",
    "however , if we use a smaller @xmath6 or a larger @xmath3 , @xmath36 has to be larger than @xmath0 . in this paper , we take @xmath0 as the lowest value of the timeon mass .",
    "consequently , we can also estimate the mixings in @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 meson systems from the timeon contributions . by using @xmath49",
    ", we obtain @xmath50 it is clear that all the fcnc processes are suppressed if @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "now we would like to briefly comment on the possible origin of the small parameter @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath7 is a gauge singlet scalar field , it can not be incorporated into the renormalizable @xmath53 model .",
    "one way out is to consider a non - renormalizable interacting term , such as , @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a @xmath56 doublet scalar and @xmath57 is a typical energy scale of the model . in this case",
    ", @xmath58 might be able to explain the existence of the small parameter @xmath3 .",
    "as the construction of realistic models goes beyond our purpose of this paper , we do not discuss this point further .",
    "in this section , we extend the timeon model to the lepton sector .",
    "the lepton mass hamiltonian is similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : quark ] ) , given by @xmath59_{ij}\\ell_{j }          + \\bar{\\nu}_i^{(c)}[g_\\nu + i\\gamma_5 \\epsilon_\\nu \\tau_0 f]_{ij}\\nu_j\\ ,           \\label{eq : lepton}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 and @xmath61 represent charged leptons and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "note that in the charged lepton sector , we use the same parameter @xmath3 as that of the quark sector , whereas in the neutrino sector we assume a different small parameter @xmath62 as neutrino masses would be due to some new physics such as the see - saw mechanism , which may have a different origin from that of the charged fermions .",
    "the matrix @xmath10 takes the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmatrix ] ) but described by different angles @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for @xmath65 , we assume the following simple textures of @xmath66 @xmath67 respectively . note that this corresponds to @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xcite .    here",
    ", we would like to comment on several features of the model . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gell ] ) and ( [ eq : gnu ] ) imply the exact tri - bimaximal lepton mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath70 after @xmath7 receives the vev , the mixing matrix deviates from exact tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "however , if @xmath71 , there is no flavor changing timeon coupling in the charged lepton sector , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 remain . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 will be different from @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , and flavor changing timeon couplings in the charged lepton sector are induced .",
    "as in the case of the quark sector , @xmath1 is spontaneously broken .",
    "we note that if @xmath71 , the @xmath1 violating dirac phase in the neutrino sector will not show up due to @xmath72 . since our model is a special case of ref .",
    "@xcite , the analytic study is the same as that in ref . @xcite .",
    "because the values of @xmath3 and @xmath6 are already determined as @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the quark sector , the model is described by seven parameters : @xmath81 and @xmath62 , which can be fixed by seven physical quantities . in our numerical calculation , we take  @xcite @xmath82 and  @xcite @xmath83 one may think that if we also use @xmath75 , we can determine the value of @xmath84 without the result in the quark sector .",
    "however , the experimental upper limit of @xmath75 is too mild to constrain the model .",
    "nevertheless , the value of @xmath75 is obtained as a prediction of the model . from the quantities in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : d1 ] ) and ( [ eq : d2 ] ) , we get @xmath85 . hence , our model gives a small @xmath75 as well as fcncs mediated by the timeon . in figure",

    ". the branching ratios of the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays due to these coupling are given by  @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the fine structure constant , @xmath91 or @xmath92 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and @xmath95 is the life time of the @xmath96 lepton . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : meg ] ) and ( [ eq : t3 m ] ) , we obtain @xmath97 similarly , we find that the timeon contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath98 it is clear that all contributions to the leptonic processes from the timeon are too small to be measured in the near future .",
    "we have investigated the timeon model , which is a new kind of spontaneous @xmath1 violation mechanism , recently proposed by friedberg and lee  @xcite .",

    "we have also extended the timeon model to the lepton sector .",
