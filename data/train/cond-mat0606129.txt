    "vortices are a hallmark of superfluids and have applications throughout the study of fluid mechanics and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "recently , gaseous bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) under rotation have become an important test bed for predictions of the behavior of quantized vortices , which form highly regular lattices @xcite . in these gases ,",
    "time - of - flight ( tof ) imaging has been an indispensable tool for observing the rotation of the cloud through the detection of the vortex cores .",
    "however , this technique only measures the superfluid density , and not the phase of the macroscopic wavefunction .",
    "phase measurements would provide a more complete picture of vortex states , especially useful in cases where individual vortices might not be easily detected . in atomic gases",
    ", one can apply powerful optical and spectroscopic techniques @xcite that afford new possibilities for performing phase measurements .    in this work ,",
    "we explore two photon bragg scattering as a tool that provides information about the phase of a rotating bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we focus on both the microscopic and macroscopic signatures of the vortices in section 2 of the paper , and present experimental data using this technique in section 3 .",
    "vortex states in becs have gained interest in recent years . here",
    "we will give a brief introduction to their properties , and refer the reader to useful review articles by fetter and kevrekidis for further details @xcite .",
    "our starting point is a gas of bosonic atoms for which the order parameter @xmath0 satisfies the gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the reduced planck constant , @xmath3 is the atomic mass and @xmath4 is the sum of all external potentials including the trapping potential .",
    "@xmath5 is a single - particle schrodinger wavefunction for which @xmath6 , the total atom number .",
    "it approximates the many body physical description in the limit of weak interactions between the atoms and very low temperatures , both of which can be satisfied in the laboratory for a wide range of conditions . since @xmath5 is in general complex ,",
    "it may be written as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the superfluid density and @xmath9 the phase of the wavefunction .",
    "the superfluid velocity field @xmath10 is proportional to the gradient of the phase .",
    "since phase is only defined modulo @xmath11 , it is readily apparent that the circulation @xmath12 must be quantized , where @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest state for which this condition is satisfied is a single vortex state with @xmath14 .    for our purposes",
    ", we will assume that we have a harmonically trapped bose - einstein condensate in the oblate potential of a `` top '' , or time - orbiting potential magnetic trap .",
    "this trap has azimuthal symmetry in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "it consists of a rapidly rotating magnetic bias field superimposed on a static quadrupole magnetic trap .",
    "the net effect is to move the magnetic field zero outside of the cloud , thus preventing nonadiabatic spin flips @xcite , and resulting in a time - averaged potential @xmath16 . within this",
    "potential , a singly quantized vortex line aligned with the @xmath17 direction has a phase @xmath18 , where @xmath19tan@xmath20 is the azimuthal angle . thus the velocity field @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the planck constant and @xmath3 is the mass of the atom .    in figure",
    "[ single_vortex ] , we show the vector velocity field of a single vortex from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : single_vortex ] , as well as its @xmath23-projection @xmath24 as a 3-dimensional surface . from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : single_vortex ] and the plots , one can see that although the vector magnitude @xmath25 has azimuthal symmetry , the projection @xmath26 clearly does not  the x - velocity is largest along the @xmath27-axis and goes to zero along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "the region @xmath29 that contains the singularity at the origin has been removed from the plots for clarity .    for large angular momentum ,",
    "the superfluid typically breaks up into a lattice of @xmath30 singly - quantized vortices that form a triangular structure @xcite .",
    "we have shown the corresponding column density profile of the atoms , proportional to @xmath31 , in figure [ vortex - lattice]a . in the vicinity of each vortex core , the particle density @xmath32 within a region of radius @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the `` healing length '' , the microscopic length scale that emerges from the gpe .",
    "except at the condensate boundaries , the overall density distribution of the trapped gas is well approximated by the thomas - fermi profile @xmath35 .",
    "the thomas - fermi radii are @xmath36 and @xmath37 along the @xmath17 and @xmath38 direction , respectively @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath39 m , @xmath40 m and @xmath41 m for our experimental parameters . to generate the column density profile , we multiply the thomas - fermi solution @xmath42 by a variational function @xmath43 for the vortex density .",
    "we used @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and the @xmath30 vortices are located at @xmath46 , with @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this allows the density to vanish at each singularity and gives us an approximate solution to the gross - pitaevskii equation which is valid so long as the vortex separation @xmath48 greatly exceeds the core size @xmath34 .",
    "for our parameters @xmath49 m @xmath50 .",
    "adjacent to the vortex distribution , we have also shown an experimental image of the column density profile which we have observed in a _ time - of - flight _ image of a rotating bec , which confirms the lattice structure of the vortices .",
    "this method involves turning off the trap at time @xmath51 and imaging the column density after a variable time of free flight , and the image roughly corresponds to the velocity distribution of the atoms just before @xmath51 .",
    "the corresponding velocity field of a rapidly rotating bec can be approximated as the sum over all vortices .",
    "this is a valid approximation in the limit where the vortex separation greatly exceeds the core size : @xmath52 in figure [ vortex - lattice]a ( rightmost graph ) , we have plotted @xmath53 for a hexagonal lattice containing several vortices .",
    "one can clearly observe that the background velocity ( i.e. away from the singularities ) increases roughly linearly with the @xmath27-coordinate .",
    "that is , when one coarse - grains over the velocity fields of the individual vortices , the resulting field is that of a rigid body rotation @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the rate of rotation of the lattice @xcite .",
    "there are also intriguing signatures of the core regions in figure [ vortex - lattice]b , which we will explore below .",
    "time - of - flight images such as those we have shown in figure [ vortex - lattice]a typically measure only the column density distribution of the atoms .",
    "that is , the signal in the image is proportional to @xmath56 , and does not directly measure the phase @xmath9 of the wavefunction does depend on the phase @xmath9 , however , since the two are coupled during the time - of - flight evolution . ] .",
    "one technique for probing @xmath9 is two photon bragg scattering @xcite , which is sensitive to the velocity of the atoms , which is @xmath57 .",
    "the full details of bragg scattering process are beyond the scope of this paper , and therefore , we will concentrate only on a few key features which are relevant to our data .",
    "more details on bragg scattering can be found elsewhere @xcite .    in brief , the bragg method employs two laser beams with frequencies @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "an atom scatters a photon from one laser beam into another .",
    "the net result is to impart to it a momentum @xmath60 . for counterpropagating laser beams of wavelength @xmath61",
    ", @xmath62 is twice the momentum of a single photon .",
    "the two photon process and the energy - momentum relation are shown schematically in figure [ fig : bragg]a . for a condensate , @xmath63 is typically much greater than the initial velocity of the atoms , and therefore , the diffracted cloud can be easily distinguished from the non - diffracted atoms .",
    "this is because the former have traveled an additional distance @xmath64 during the time - of - flight @xmath65 after the trap has been shut off .",
    "the two clouds can then be separated in the images , as we show below .",
    "there is a resonance in the scattering of light when @xmath66 which expresses the conservation of momentum and energy . in the above equation ,",
    "the second term is the recoil energy , which must be provided by the energy difference between the two photons . for sodium atoms near the principal resonance , @xmath67 khz .",
    "the third term is simply the doppler shift , which makes the bragg technique velocity sensitive .",
    "it is this term which is of primary importance to this work , as the bragg process selects a group of atoms with the same projection of velocity @xmath68 along the direction of the momentum transfer @xmath69 . for a trapped bec",
    ", one also has to consider the effects of interactions . in the mean - field and local density approximations",
    "@xcite , this causes an extra @xmath70 frequency shift , where @xmath71 is the chemical potential .",
    "this shift is a consequence of the bogoliubov dispersion relation for condensate excitations , as discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "free particles have @xmath72 . in our case , for a stationary condensate , the bragg resonance is peaked at a frequency @xmath73 khz .",
    "thus @xmath74 .",
    "spatially selective bragg scattering in principle allows one to `` peer into '' the complex velocity flow field of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : many_vortex ]",
    ". one may understand this in an intuitive way by considering the velocity surface @xmath75 in figure [ vortex - lattice ] .",
    "for a given bragg beam detuning @xmath76 we select a velocity @xmath77 through eqn .",
    "[ eq : delta ] .",
    "the region of space containing atoms that are moving at that velocity is given by the solution to the equation @xmath78 .",
    "geometrically , this represents the intersection of the surface with a plane at height @xmath77 , and is simply a velocity contour map . in figure [ vortex - lattice]b , we show the resulting _ spatial distribution _ of atoms that are bragg diffracted .",
    "the grey scale is proportional to the number of atoms within a velocity range of @xmath79mm / s , typical of the experimental resolution .",
    "two features are clearly visible . for one ,",
    "there is a broad horizontal band of atoms that are resonant with the laser whose center of mass y - coordinate @xmath80 varies as one varies the detuning of the laser beams .",
    "@xmath80 satisfies the rigid body condition @xmath54 .",
    "we have varied the detuning to map out @xmath80 as a function of the velocity experimentally @xcite .",
    "in addition , the spatial distributions contain information about the _ microscopic _",
    "flow field of the vortices .",
    "the bands at constant @xmath80 in figure [ vortex - lattice]b are not uniform ; rather , there is a local structure to the velocity field associated with the flow around individual vortices .",
    "this leads to beautiful patterns in the spatial profile of the diffracted atoms , including crescent and diamond shapes .",
    "these patterns are _ imprinted _ by the bragg beams through the velocity selection .",
    "the existence of spatial signatures of the vortex state was first discovered by blakie et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the bragg scattering from a _ single _ vortex .",
    "they used a mean - field approach , incorporating the laser beam potential into the gross - pitaevskii equation to derive the spatial and temporal evolution of the bragg scattered atoms .",
    "observing signatures of these patterns in time - of - flight imaging is complicated by the mean - field evolution during the time - of - flight expansion , as discussed in @xcite . in the following section we also discuss the necessary tradeoff between spatial and velocity resolution .",
    "the spectral width of the bragg resonance is of critical importance , and is discussed in detail in a number of works .",
    "the finite temporal width @xmath81 of the bragg pulse creates spectral broadening . through the doppler shift , this limits the velocity resolution @xmath82 to @xmath83    a rotating bec also has a spatial distribution of velocities . in order to achieve a spatial resolution @xmath84 along the direction of the bragg beams ,",
    "the pulse duration must be short enough that the recoiling atoms from regions of the condensate that are separated by @xmath84 do not spatially overlap during the pulse .",
    "therefore , @xmath85    in our experiments we choose a time @xmath86s .",
    "the recoil velocity is @xmath87 cm / s , while typical rotational velocities are @xmath88 mm / s and the thomas - fermi diameter is @xmath89 m .",
    "this yields @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which is a balance between good velocity and spatial resolution to observe the overall structure of the rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note the trade - off between high spatial and velocity resolutions , since their product @xmath92 is a constant .",
    "for very short pulses @xmath93s for our system , the vortex core regions could be resolved optically according to the above criterion ; however , there will be a substantial spread of the velocities of the atoms which are bragg diffracted .",
    "in our experiments we produce a sodium bec with typically @xmath94 atoms in a time - averaged orbiting potential ( top ) trap @xcite , according to the method described in @xcite .",
    "parameters for the trap are a radial gradient @xmath95 gauss / cm and a bias rotation of @xmath96 khz .",
    "the measured transverse oscillation frequency is @xmath97 hz , with @xmath98 . for details of experimental techniques ,",
    "the reader is referred to several excellent review articles @xcite .",
    "we produce the vortex - lattice by creating a rotating elliptical asymmetry in the horizontal _ x - y _ plane of the top trap @xcite .",
    "the top trap employs a fast rotating bias field @xmath99 at a frequency @xmath100 much greater than that of the atomic motion .",
    "this creates a time - averaged harmonic potential .",
    "therefore , we can create a slowly rotating elliptical potential by superimposing slow variations upon the fast oscillation of the bias field . to produce the fields , we combine the signals of two digital frequency synthesizers operating at frequencies @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "these signals are each split , phase shifted and summed together to produce the two fields : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the amplitude and frequency of the rotating asymmetry , respectively .",
    "the two currents are individually amplified using 100 watt car audio amplifiers , and capacitively coupled to a pair of helmholtz coils of approximately 10 cm diameter along the @xmath28 and @xmath27 directions , respectively ( see figure [ fig : bragg]b ) . in order to maximize the number of vortices , we chose @xmath107 hz , which is very close to the frequency @xmath108 that drives the quadrupole mode in our harmonic trap @xcite .",
    "after applying the rotating asymmetry for 1.5 seconds , it was turned off and the atomic cloud allowed to equilibrate in the trap for another 1 to 1.5 seconds .",
    "this procedure reliably created vortex lattices with approximately 40 @xmath109 10 vortices , as shown in fig .",
    "2a .      after producing vortices and allowing the lattice to equilibrate",
    ", we pulse the bragg diffracting beams along the @xmath28-direction ( see figure [ fig : bragg])b ) for a time @xmath110 , while the atoms are still in the trap .",
    "the bragg beams are detuned by 1.7 ghz from the @xmath111 to @xmath112 resonance , and are created by back - reflecting a single beam that contains two frequencies @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath76 is the difference between the frequencies of two rf synthesizers that are used to drive a single acousto - optic modulator .",
    "this creates 2 groups of diffracted atoms propagating to the left and to the right , respectively .",
    "we applied a bragg pulse of square shape with @xmath115 , and then turned off the magnetic trap within @xmath116s .",
    "the atoms expanded for a variable @xmath65 before we took an absorption image using laser light resonant with the @xmath117 transition in a @xmath118s pulse . the result is shown in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures ] .",
    "we can clearly observe _ spatial structures _ in the outcoupled atom cloud arising from the rotation of the cloud . in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]a one can see the diffraction from an initially stationary condensate , and the diffracted ( outcoupled ) atoms appear to the right and left of the stationary condensate .",
    "no particular structure is visible .",
    "however , in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]b , we have initially prepared a vortex lattice , which causes the diffracted atoms to form a tilted , elongated spatial pattern . moreover ,",
    "when we reversed the direction of the applied rotation ( by replacing @xmath119 ) , the tilt angle with respect to the @xmath27-direction reverses , as shown in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]c .",
    "we can understand our observations in terms of the coarse - grained velocity field discussed earlier : @xmath120 , with @xmath121 proportional to the number of vortices . since the bragg process selects a group of atoms with the same @xmath54 , the resonance condition",
    "is given by @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , for a spectrally narrow bragg pulse , with @xmath123 and a counter - clockwise rotation , the resonance corresponds to a thin , horizontal band of atoms with @xmath124 for atoms which are bragg scattered to the right , and @xmath125 for atoms scattered to the left ( the dark shaded regions in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]d ) .",
    "this band is identical to what is shown in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]c , and within it there is a detailed microscopic structure near the vortex cores which is not resolved in our current experiment . as this band of atoms moves , the spread in velocities in the @xmath15 plane causes part of the band to move up while another part moves down .",
    "thus it forms a tilted stripe whose angle increases with time , as observed in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]e . at long tof",
    "the stripe should become fully stretched along the vertical axis of the images .",
    "a calculation of the rotation frequency from the evolution of the tilt angle as function of time ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 : spatial - structures]e ) , @xmath126 , results in @xmath127 hz ) .",
    "moreover , one can use the locations of the diffracted cloud ( @xmath128 and @xmath129 in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]d ) to spatially map the velocity field , which results in a similar value for the rotation rate @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with the estimate based on the total quantized vorticity of the lattice . for",
    "that we note the fact that in the rigid body limit @xmath130 @xcite , and therefore , by measuring the number of vortices @xmath30 one can calculate the rotation rate .",
    "we used @xmath131 m and @xmath30 was determined by a manual counting of the number of vortices from several images taken at long tof .",
    "this resulted in @xmath132 , which leads to @xmath133 hz@xmath134 .",
    "the time - of - flight technique is a destructive method and can not be used for _ in - situ _ observation of the dynamics of the rotating condensate .",
    "however , the bragg method couples out a small fraction of the atoms , and therefore , can be used as a non - destructive probe .",
    "we demonstrate this by applying a sequence of two @xmath135 ms duration bragg pulses .",
    "pulse 1 diffracted a group of atoms which then evolved for a variable time delay @xmath136 in the harmonic trapping potential , after which a second group was created by pulse 2 .",
    "the trap was then immediately switched off , and an absorption image taken after 10 ms of time - of - flight .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : tilting ] for 3 different hold times @xmath136 .",
    "one can observe two diffracted stripes on either side of the undiffracted cloud in the center .",
    "these correspond to the two groups of atoms created by pulses 1 and 2 .",
    "the stripes tilted to the left are the result of pulse 2 , and resemble those observed in figure [ figure4 : spatial - structures]b .",
    "this indicates that the bragg process is indeed non - destructive , and does not appear to significantly affect the rotation .",
    "due to the confining potential , atoms are slowed down during the time @xmath136 as they leave the cloud . therefore , the diffracted cloud from pulse 1 has a lower velocity than that of pulse 2 when the trap is shut off .",
    "therefore , it appears closer to the undiffracted cloud after a long tof than does pulse 2 .",
    "both pulses result in tilted images of the diffracted atoms ; however , one can clearly see that pulse 1 has a tilt angle and shape which is different from pulse 2 .",
    "in fact , the tilt angle reverses sign after very short hold times @xmath137 ms compared with the trap oscillation period of @xmath138ms .",
    "this rapid distortion of the diffracted cloud from pulse 1 within 2.5 ms evolution in the trap is somewhat counterintuitive .",
    "one might only expect the atoms to reverse their trajectory after @xmath139 ms , that is , after a quarter period oscillation in the magnetic trap .",
    "this apparent paradox can be resolved when one considers the spatial extent of the diffracted cloud and simple kinematics of the evolution . in figure",
    "[ fig : tilting ] we show the full potential @xmath140 experienced by the bragg scattered atoms .",
    "this consists of both the harmonic trapping potential and the factor of 2 larger mean - field repulsion from the undiffracted condensate at density @xmath141 , @xmath142 @xcite .",
    "both atoms at the front end of the bec as well as those at the back receive a kick and begin to move with a recoil velocity @xmath63 which is considerably larger than the rotational velocity .",
    "atoms at the front `` climb up '' the potential for a time @xmath143ms , and are therefore , slowed down , but atoms at the back end of the bec do not change their energy substantially .",
    "the back end can thus catch up with the front end during the 10 ms tof . combined with the rotation of the strip , this causes a reversal of the tilt angle of the diffracted cloud from pulse 2 .",
    "we have performed a numerical simulation of classical trajectories in a two - dimensional harmonic potential for our parameters .",
    "it confirms that the stripe should become vertical and tilt in the opposite direction for @xmath144ms , which is consistent with our observations in figure [ fig : tilting]c .",
    "therefore , the non - destructive method clearly has limitations , since the spatial tof profile is the result of both the _ initial _ rotating distribution as well as its _ in - situ _ evolution during the hold time .",
    "in conclusion , we have used bragg scattering to directly measure the velocity profile of a rotating bec .",
    "the technique is complementary to time - of - flight imaging , and has direct application to the study of non - equilibrium superfluid dynamics @xcite , where the tangle of vortices reduces their visibility .",
    "it might also be applied to measuring the normal fluid regime at finite temperature , where vorticity is not present .",
    "future experimental work will attempt to measure the microscopic flow field using bragg diffraction .",
