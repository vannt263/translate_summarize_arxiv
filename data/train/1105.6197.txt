    "it is well known that the gdel universe contains closed timelike curves @xcite .",

    "himself remarked that if the acceleration is provided by a rocket then the required amount of fuel is prohibitively high @xcite .",
    "this amount can be computed from the well known rocket equation @xcite , which relates the initial and final rest masses of the rocket : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the proper time , @xmath2 is the rest mass , @xmath3 is the magnitude of the proper acceleration and @xmath4 is the ejection speed . since @xmath4 must be smaller than the speed of light ) .",
    "] , @xmath5 , we have @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the so - called * total integrated acceleration*. malament @xcite proved that @xmath8 for any closed timelike curve in the gdel universe , and conjectured that in fact @xmath9 .",
    "notice that if this conjecture is true then @xmath10 for any rocket following a closed timelike curve in the gdel universe ! manchak @xcite , however , proved that there exist closed timelike curves in the gdel universe with @xmath11 .",
    "these curves are not periodic , in the sense that the initial four - velocity is not equal to the final four - velocity , and it seems likely that if one includes the integrated acceleration necessary to boost the final four - velocity to the initial four - velocity then malament s conjecture still holds .",
    "nevertheless , manchak did succeed in showing that one can have time travel in the gdel universe with total integrated acceleration smaller than malament s bound .",
    "the situation is analogous to the problem of finding a closed curve in euclidean space for which the total integrated geodesic curvature with respect to the arclength ( the riemannian analogue of the lorentzian total integrated acceleration ) is minimum .",
    "if we require the curve to be periodic , then the minimum is @xmath12 , and it is attained by a circle , for example . if , however , we do not require the initial and final directions of the curve to match up , there is no minimum ; the infimum is @xmath13 , and is approached by a sequence of closed curves consisting of an arc of circle subtending an angle @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) and two line segments tangent to its endpoints , which therefore meet at an angle @xmath16 ( see figure  [ closed_euclidean ] ) .",
    "the intersection of the line segments is meant to be the curve s initial and final point .",
    "notice that the integrated geodesic curvature required for `` turning the corner '' at this point ( thus making the curve periodic ) is precisely @xmath17 .",
    "= .7    in this paper we present a candidate for the minimum total integrated acceleration closed timelike curve in the gdel universe , and give evidence for its minimality .",
    "the total integrated acceleration of this curve turns out to be approximately @xmath18 .",
    "if one includes the integrated acceleration necessary to boost the final four - velocity to the initial four - velocity , however , total integrated acceleration increases to about @xmath19 , and so malament s conjecture is not violated .",
    "the candidate curve is more complicated than one would guess from the euclidean space analogy , and is obtained by applying the general theory of optimal rocket trajectories in general relativity developed in @xcite . for the reader s",
    "convenience , this theory is summarized in section  [ section1 ] , and the main features of the gdel universe are reviewed in section  [ section2 ] . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we solve the jacobi equation for a timelike geodesic , and in section  [ section4 ] we compute the circular optimal accelerated arcs , both of which are used in section  [ section5 ] to construct the candidate curve and give evidence for its minimality .",
    "in @xcite the classical newtonian theory of optimal rocket trajectories developed in @xcite was generalized to the general relativity setting .",
    "there it is shown that optimal trajectories are expected to be continuous , sectionally smooth timelike curves , obtained by piecing together free - fall ( geodesic ) and accelerated arcs , possibly with instantaneous ( dirac delta ) accelerations at the junction points .",
    "if the trajectory minimizes the total integrated acceleration then it satisfies the differential equations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the four - velocity , @xmath22 is the magnitude of the proper acceleration , @xmath23 is an auxiliary vector field , called the * primer * , and @xmath24 are the components of the riemann curvature tensor .",
    "all quantities above are continuous at a junction point except possibly @xmath21 and @xmath23 , which change by a boost with positive parameter in their common plane if there is an instantaneous acceleration .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath25 the primer , however , is @xmath26 at the junction points , and satisfies @xmath27 on free - fall arcs and @xmath28 on accelerated arcs and instantaneous accelerations .",
    "moreover , the equations above admit the first integrals @xmath29 finally , it is easily seen from @xcite that if the initial or final four - velocities are not specified then we must have @xmath30 at those points .    for free - fall arcs ( @xmath31 ) , conditions reduce to the geodesic and jacobi ( geodesic deviation ) equations , with the first integrals requiring the jacobi field @xmath23 to be orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath21 .    for accelerated arcs , we have from and @xmath32 differentiating this new first integral yields @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the sectional curvature of the tangent plane spanned by @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath3 of the proper acceleration must then be chosen so that holds at each instant . using and , we can easily rewrite as @xmath35",
    "the gdel universe is a space - time homogeneous solution of the einstein equations with a pressureless perfect fluid and a negative cosmological constant .",
    "it corresponds to the lorentzian metric in @xmath36 given in cylindrical coordinates by @xmath37 where we have chosen units such that the cosmological constant is @xmath38 and the matter density is @xmath39 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the fluid worldlines are tangent to the timelike killing vector field @xmath40 , and have vorticity given in our units by @xmath41 ( so the fluid elements are rotating with angular velocity @xmath42 about the @xmath43-axis with respect to the local compass of inertia ) .    in what follows",
    "we will restrict ourselves to a totally geodesic submanifold of constant @xmath43 ( which we will still call the gdel universe ) , with metric @xmath44 ( the nontrivial part of the gdel metric ) .",
    "notice that the quotient of this manifold by the isometric @xmath45-action generated by @xmath40 is the hyperbolic plane of radius @xmath46 ( hence our choice of units ) .",
    "the gdel universe famously contains closed timelike curves ( for instance the integral curves of @xmath47 for @xmath48 sufficiently large ) . for any timelike curve with proper time @xmath1",
    "we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the line element of the hyperbolic plane . solving for @xmath51 yields @xmath52 for future - directed curves ( corresponding to the positive square root ) .",
    "therefore if the projection @xmath53 of the timelike curve on the hyperbolic plane is closed then the coordinate time difference between its endpoints is @xmath54 it is easy to check that the velocity @xmath4 of the timelike curve with respect to the matter satisfies @xmath55 if the curve @xmath53 is simple and bounds a region @xmath56 then we can use the stokes theorem to write @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the oriented hyperbolic area of @xmath56 ( negative or positive according to whether @xmath53 is traversed clockwise or anticlockwise ) . for the timelike curve to be closed ( @xmath59 )",
    "we then see that @xmath53 must be traversed clockwise ( so that @xmath60 ) .",
    "moreover , since we must necessarily have @xmath61 , the length @xmath62 of @xmath53 satisfies @xmath63 given @xmath64 , we known that @xmath62 is minimized when @xmath53 is a circle @xcite .",
    "now a circle of radius @xmath48 in the hyperbolic plane satisfies @xmath65 and so is satisfied by a circle of radius @xmath48 if @xmath66 that is , if @xmath48 is bigger than the positive root of @xmath67 which is @xmath68 .",
    "we conclude that can only hold if @xmath69 . in other words ,",
    "the projection @xmath53 of a closed timelike curve must enclose a sufficiently large area . notice that if @xmath69 then there is indeed a closed timelike curve whose projection encloses this area ",
    "just choose @xmath53 to be a circle and @xmath61 an appropriate constant .",
    "also , the isoperimetric property of the circle implies that the the projection of a closed timelike curve must have length @xmath70 .",
    "moreover , we see from that the maximum velocity of the closed timelike curve with respect to the matter , @xmath71 , must satisfy @xmath72 again by the isoperimetric property of the circle ( an equivalent observation was made in @xcite ) .",
    "choosing the natural orthonormal frame @xmath73 with dual coframe @xmath74 one readily obtains from the first cartan structure equations @xmath75 the nonvanishing connection forms @xmath76 the second cartan structure equations @xmath77 then yield the nonvanishing curvature forms @xmath78 from the general expression @xmath79 we obtain the independent components of the riemann tensor in this orthonormal frame , @xmath80    consider now a timelike curve whose projection on the hyperbolic plane is a circle of radius @xmath48 .",
    "because of the space - time homogeneity of the gdel universe , we may assume that the circle is centered at the origin @xmath81 of our coordinate system .",
    "if the circle is traversed clockwise with constant velocity @xmath82 with respect to the matter then the four - velocity of the timelike curve is @xmath83 and hence its covariant acceleration is @xmath84 in particular , the curve is a geodesic if and only if @xmath85 .",
    "the space - time homogeneity of the gdel universe implies that all timelike geodesics of the gdel universe are of this form .",
    "notice that the radius of the circle satisfies @xmath86 and so no timelike geodesic can be closed .",
    "the minimum conditions , on a free - fall arc reduce to the jacobi equation for a jacobi field orthogonal to the four - velocity .",
    "if we choose coordinates @xmath87 centered at the center of the free - fall arc , we have @xmath88 with @xmath89 , and so @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the unit vector field orthogonal to @xmath21 and @xmath92 pointing in the same direction as @xmath93 . using the connection forms and @xmath89 ,",
    "one readily checks that @xmath94 for a geodesic , and so @xmath95 whence @xmath96 the jacobi equation , @xmath97 has three components .",
    "the component along @xmath21 , @xmath98 is trivially satisfied . the component along @xmath92 , @xmath99 and the component along @xmath93 , @xmath100 form the system of linear odes @xmath101 ( where we used ) .",
    "this system is readily solved to yield @xmath102 where @xmath103 are integrations constants and @xmath104 .",
    "notice that the period of the projection of the timelike geodesic on the hyperbolic plane is precisely @xmath105 that is , @xmath106 is the angular frequency with respect to the proper time @xmath1 .",
    "for an optimal circular accelerated arc the covariant acceleration is proportional to @xmath92 , and so @xmath107 . using the connection forms one readily",
    "checks that @xmath108 and so @xmath109 from we have @xmath110 and from @xmath111 therefore we can write as @xmath112 where @xmath82 is the constant velocity of the optimal accelerated arc with respect to the matter .",
    "this can be solved with respect to @xmath113 to yield @xmath114 the @xmath115 sign determines whether @xmath116 points in the same direction as @xmath92 or in the opposite direction . indeed , from we see that this happens if and only if @xmath117 it is easy to see that as @xmath4 varies from @xmath118 to @xmath46 the @xmath119 branch of increases from @xmath118 to @xmath120 , whereas the @xmath121 branch decreases from @xmath122 to @xmath120 . since we must have @xmath123 , the @xmath121 branch is only defined for @xmath124 .    since @xmath125 , we see that only the @xmath121 branch of can contain an optimal circular accelerated arc which is a closed timelike curve .",
    "such a curve must satisfy @xmath126 therefore we must have @xmath127 and so from @xmath128 squaring this equation we obtain @xmath129 and , since @xmath130 is an obvious root of the polynomial @xmath131 , we readily obtain @xmath132 as the only real solution of .",
    "this optimal closed accelerated arc is precisely malament s conjectured optimal trajectory .",
    "its total integrated acceleration is @xmath133 or , since @xmath134 we have @xmath135 using @xmath136 we obtain @xmath137 as advertised in the introduction .",
    "the optimality of this curve can be partially checked as follows . using the formulae above , it is not hard to show that @xmath138 for closed timelike curves with constant velocity with respect to the matter whose projection on the hyperbolic plane is a circle of radius @xmath48 .",
    "it is then easy to show that malament s curve does indeed minimize @xmath139 among these curves .",
    "notice that the proper time necessary to traverse malament s curve is @xmath140 which in our units can be written as @xmath141 therefore if the matter density of the gdel universe is comparable to the matter density of our universe then the proper time for this curve is comparable to the hubble time for our universe , about @xmath142 years .",
    "the proper acceleration will be correspondingly low .",
    "we now present our candidate for the optimal trajectory and give evidence for its optimality .",
    "our simplifying assumption is that this trajectory contains a circular accelerated arc of radius @xmath143 .",
    "assuming , by analogy with malament s trajectory , that the acceleration points outwards , we have from that the velocity @xmath144 of this arc with respect to the matter satisfies @xmath145 because we are simply looking for the closed timelike curve which minimizes the total integrated acceleration , we do not specify the initial and final four - velocities , and so , as stated in section  [ section1 ] , @xmath23 must vanish at the endpoints . since @xmath28 on accelerated arcs and instantaneous accelerations ,",
    "we conclude that these endpoints must be on free - fall arcs .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath146 throughout the accelerated arc , and so if there are instantaneous accelerations at its endpoints these must be in the outward radial direction .",
    "the simplest candidate curve of this kind is an initial free - fall arc , followed by the circular accelerated arc , followed by another free - fall arc , possibly with instantaneous accelerations at the transitions . by simplicity",
    "we assume that the final free - fall arc mirrors the initial one , both having radius @xmath147 and velocity @xmath148 with respect to the matter .",
    "the projection of this candidate curve on the hyperbolic plane will then be an arc of a large circle of radius @xmath149 , and two arcs of smaller circles of radius @xmath48 , as shown in figure  [ optimal_godel ] ( where we use circles and lines to represent circles and geodesics of the hyperbolic plane ) .",
    "= .7    each trajectory of this kind is determined by @xmath150 parameters , which we will take to be the velocity @xmath144 of the accelerated arc with respect to the matter , the boost parameter @xmath151 of the instantaneous accelerations , and the angle @xmath152 in figure  [ optimal_godel ] .",
    "this immediately fixes @xmath149 through . on the other hand ,",
    "if we use coordinates centered at the center of the accelerated arc then the four - velocity of this arc is @xmath153 where @xmath154 if we apply an instantaneous acceleration in the radial direction with boost parameter @xmath151 then the four - velocity jumps to @xmath155 on the other hand , we must also have @xmath156 where @xmath4 is the velocity of the final ( hence also the initial ) free - fall arc with respect to the matter , @xmath157 and @xmath158 is the angle between the two radii depicted in figure  [ optimal_godel ] ( notice that the radius of a circle in the hyperbolic plane is orthogonal to the circle , and so @xmath158 is also the angle between the two tangents ) .",
    "therefore @xmath159 notice that this fixes @xmath160 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath161 and so @xmath158 is also fixed .",
    "now if @xmath162 is the distance between the center of the accelerated arc and the center of the free - fall arc , we have from the hyperbolic law of cosines @xcite @xmath163 ( see figure  [ optimal_godel ] ) , which fixes @xmath162 . from the hyperbolic law of sines we have @xmath164 and @xmath165 which fixes the angles @xmath166 and @xmath167 depicted in figure  [ optimal_godel ] .",
    "similarly , if @xmath168 is the distance between the center of the accelerated arc and the outermost intersection of the free - fall arcs , we have from the hyperbolic law of cosines @xmath169 ( see figure  [ optimal_godel ] ) , which fixes @xmath168 . from the hyperbolic law of sines we have @xmath170 and @xmath171 which fixes the final two angles @xmath172 and @xmath173 depicted in figure  [ optimal_godel ] .    the three parameters @xmath144 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 are not independent , as we are looking for a closed timelike curve .",
    "equation implies that the area @xmath58 enclosed by the projection curve in the hyperbolic plane must satisfy @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the length of the accelerated arc , and @xmath176 is the sum of the lengths of the free - fall arcs . using the gauss - bonnet formula for the area of a hyperbolic triangle @xcite ,",
    "we can write @xmath177    from , the acceleration the accelerated arc is @xmath178 and the proper time necessary to traverse it is @xmath179 therefore the trajectory s total integrated acceleration ( including the two instantaneous accelerations ) is @xmath180    notice that the angle between the projections of the two free - fall arcs is @xmath181 .",
    "this means that if @xmath182 is the orthonormal frame associated to coordinates @xmath87 centered at the center of the final free - fall arc , so that the final four - velocity is given by @xmath183 then the initial four - velocity is @xmath184 therefore the hyperbolic angle @xmath185 between the corresponding four - velocities satisfies @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the metric , and so the integrated acceleration necessary to boost the final four - velocity to the initial four - velocity is @xmath188 if one wishes to regard the candidate curve as periodic then one must add this value of @xmath185 to .",
    "we are now ready to search for the optimal curve . because of the complexity of the formulae above , a numerical search seems to be inevitable .",
    "we use a shooting algorithm as follows : starting with arbitrary values for @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath144 , we determine the remaining parameters @xmath189 .",
    "we then use , and to compute @xmath190 , @xmath62 and @xmath58 , and check whether holds ; if not , we modify the value of @xmath144 until it does . at this point",
    "we have a closed timelike curve and can use to compute its total integrated acceleration . using this algorithm , we vary @xmath151 ( keeping @xmath152 fixed ) until @xmath139 is minimized , and then vary @xmath152 ( keeping @xmath151 fixed ) until @xmath139 is again minimized . repeating these iterations",
    "the method quickly converges to yield a closed timelike curve whose total integrated acceleration is minimum among all curves of this type .",
    "the solution is determined by @xmath191 we notice in passing that the velocity of the accelerated arc is very close to , but slightly smaller than , the velocity of malament s curve , which is @xmath192 the remaining parameters of the optimal trajectory are @xmath193 yielding the total integrated acceleration @xmath194 if we boost the final four - velocity to the initial four - velocity to make the trajectory periodic then the total integrated acceleration becomes @xmath195 in agreement with malament s conjecture .",
    "we now present evidence that this is indeed the optimal solution we seek . to avoid confusion ,",
    "we keep @xmath196 as the orthonormal frame associated to coordinates @xmath87 centered at the center of the accelerated arc , and let @xmath197 be the orthonormal frame associated to coordinates @xmath87 centered at the center of the final free - fall arc ( notice that @xmath198 ) .",
    "recall from section  [ section3 ] that on the final free - fall arc the primer has components @xmath199 in the orthonormal frame @xmath200 , where @xmath201 @xmath103 are integration constants and @xmath202 if for simplicity we set @xmath203 as the instant of transition from the accelerated arc to the free - fall arc , we have @xmath204 at that instant . moreover , it is easy to check that @xmath205 and @xmath206 at the same instant",
    ".    now , as we saw above , the instantaneous acceleration boosts the four - velocity from @xmath153 to @xmath207 consequently the new tangential direction is given by ( minus ) the normalized spatial velocity , @xmath208 and consequently the new radial direction is given by @xmath209 on the other hand , the primer is boosted from @xmath210 to @xmath211 therefore the components of the primer at the beginning of the free - fall arc are @xmath212 and @xmath213 where we used @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "recall that we must have @xmath216 at the endpoint of the final free - fall arc .",
    "now from figure  [ optimal_godel ] it is clear that @xmath217 at this endpoint . from , ,",
    "and we then have @xmath218 this can be regarded as a linear system in the integration constants @xmath103 which determine the primer in the final free - fall arc . using the numerical data in and",
    "we obtain @xmath219 now on the accelerated arc @xmath25 is identically @xmath46 .",
    "since , as stated in section  [ section1 ] , @xmath25 is a function of class @xmath26 , we must have @xmath220 at the instantaneous acceleration . given that @xmath221 we have @xmath222 and @xmath223 using , , and the numerical results in we then obtain @xmath224 and @xmath225 at the instantaneous acceleration , which is very close to zero indeed .",
    "notice that although @xmath28 at the instantaneous acceleration by construction , the values of @xmath226 and @xmath227 on the final free - fall arc arise from the jacobi equation , and are in principle completely independent .",
    "the fact that they both essentially vanish at the instantaneous acceleration is powerful evidence in favor of the optimality of our candidate curve .",
    "in this paper we presented a candidate for the closed timelike curve in the gdel universe which minimizes the total integrated acceleration .",
    "the projection of the candidate curve on the hyperbolic plane representing the spatial part of the gdel universe is depicted in figure  [ optimal_godel ] , and is traversed clockwise .",
    "it starts with a free - fall arc of velocity @xmath228 with respect to the matter , whose projection on the hyperbolic plane a @xmath229 arc of a circle of radius @xmath230 in our units .",
    "this free - fall arc ends with an instantaneous acceleration of total integrated acceleration @xmath231 , which , as seen by the matter , rotates the spatial velocity anti - clockwise by @xmath232 and reduces its magnitude to @xmath233 .",
    "the candidate curve then coincides with a circular accelerated arc of constant velocity with respect to the matter , whose projection on the hyperbolic plane is a @xmath234 arc of a circle radius @xmath235 .",
    "this sequence of events is reversed at the end of the accelerated arc : there is a new instantaneous acceleration of total integrated acceleration @xmath231 , which , as seen by the matter , rotates the spatial velocity anti - clockwise by @xmath232 and increases its magnitude back to @xmath228 , after which there is a new free - fall arc whose projection on the hyperbolic plane is another @xmath229 arc of a circle of radius @xmath230 .",
    "notice that while our candidate curve does satisfy the minimum conditions , it is possible that it is just a local minimum , or even a saddle point .",
    "the question of whether it is indeed the minimum total integrated acceleration closed timelike curve in the gdel universe will have to be settled by different methods ."
