    "classical mathematical finance has , for a long time , been based on the assumption that the price process of market securities may be approximated by geometric brownian motion @xmath0 in liquid markets the autocorrelation of price changes decays to negligible values in a few minutes , consistent with the absence of long term statistical arbitrage .",
    "geometric brownian motion models this lack of memory , although it does not reproduce the empirical leptokurtosis . on the other hand , nonlinear functions of the returns exhibit significant positive autocorrelation . for example , there is volatility clustering , with large returns expected to be followed by large returns and small returns by small returns ( of either sign ) .",
    "this , together with the fact that autocorrelations of volatility measures decline very slowly@xcite @xcite @xcite , has the clear implication that long memory effects should somehow be represented in the process and this is not included in the geometric brownian motion hypothesis .",
    "one other hand , as pointed out by engle@xcite , when the future is uncertain , investors are less likely to invest .",
    "therefore uncertainty ( volatility ) would have to be changing over time .",
    "the conclusion is that a dynamical model for volatility is needed and @xmath1 in eq.([1.00 ] ) , rather than being a constant , becomes a process by itself .",
    "this idea led to many deterministic and stochastic models for the volatility ( @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .    in a previous paper@xcite , using both a criteria of mathematical simplicity and consistency with market data , a stochastic volatility model was constructed , with volatility driven by fractional noise .",
    "it appears to be the minimal model consistent both with mathematical simplicity and the market data .",
    "this data - inspired model is different from the many stochastic volatility models that have been proposed in the literature .",
    "the model was used to compute the price return statistics and asymptotic behavior , which were compared with actual data .",
    "deviations from the classical black - scholes result and a new option pricing formula were also obtained .",
    "the _ fractional volatility model _ , its predictions and comparison with data will be reviewed in section 2 .    when this fractional volatility model was first presented , an interesting remark by an economist was  _ all right , the model seems to fit reasonably well the data , but where is the economics ? _  . the same remark might be made about the simple geometric brownian model , which does not even fit the data and is used by most of the of mathematical finance practitioners .. but , of course , our economist was right .",
    "the fractional volatility model seems to be a reasonable _ mathematical parametrization _ of the market behavior , but it is not sufficient to fit the data .",
    "one should also search for the mechanisms in the market that lead to the observed phenomena .",
    "no agent - based model can pretend to be the market itself , not even a realistic image of it .",
    "nevertheless it may provide a surrogate model of the basic mechanics at work there .",
    "therefore , the idea in this paper is to use stylized agent - based market models and find out which features of these models correspond to each one of the features of the mathematical parametrization of the data .",
    "the basic hypothesis for the model construction were :    ( h1 ) the log - price process @xmath2 belongs to a probability product space @xmath3 of which the first one , @xmath4 , is the wiener space and the second , @xmath5 , is a probability space to be reconstructed from the data .",
    "denote by @xmath6 and @xmath7 the elements ( sample paths ) in @xmath4 and @xmath5 and by @xmath8 and @xmath9 the @xmath10algebras in @xmath4 and @xmath5 generated by the processes up to @xmath11 .",
    "then , a particular realization of the log - price process is denoted @xmath12 this first hypothesis is really not limitative .",
    "even if none of the non - trivial stochastic features of the log - price were to be captured by brownian motion , that would simply mean that @xmath13 is a trivial function in @xmath4 .",
    "( h2 ) the second hypothesis is stronger , although natural .",
    "one assumes that , for each fixed @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a square integrable random variable in @xmath4 .",
    "a mathematical consequence of hypothesis ( h2 ) is that , for each fixed @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are well - defined processes in @xmath4 .",
    "( theorem 1.1.3 in ref.@xcite )    recall that if @xmath20 is a process such that @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being @xmath24adapted processes , then @xmath25    the process associated to the probability space @xmath5 could then be inferred from the data . according to ( [ 2.3 ] ) , for each fixed @xmath16 realization in @xmath5 one has @xmath26 each set of market data corresponds to a particular realization @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , assuming the realization to be typical , the @xmath28 process may be reconstructed from the data by the use of ( [ 2.4 ] ) .",
    "this data - reconstructed @xmath23 process was called the _ induced volatility_.    for practical purposes we can not strictly use eq.([2.4 ] ) to reconstruct the induced volatility process , because when the time interval @xmath29 is very small the empirical evaluation of the variance becomes unreliable .",
    "instead , @xmath23 was estimated from @xmath30 with a time window @xmath31 sufficiently small to give a reasonably local characterization of the volatility , but also sufficiently large to allow for a reliable estimate of the local variance of @xmath2 .",
    "once several data sets were analyzed@xcite , the next step towards obtaining a mathematical characterization of the _ induced volatility process _ was to look for scaling properties .",
    "it turned out that neither @xmath32 nor @xmath33 were good hypothesis for the induced volatility process .",
    "it means that the induced volatility process itself is not self - similar .",
    "if instead , one computes the empirical integrated log - volatility , one finds that it is well represented by a relation of the form @xmath34 the @xmath35 process possessing very accurate self - similar properties .",
    "a nondegenerate process @xmath36 , if it has finite variance , stationary increments and is self - similar @xmath37 must necessarily @xcite have a covariance @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the simplest process with these properties is a gaussian process called fractional brownian motion@xcite , with @xmath40 = 0\\qquad \\mathbb{e}\\left [ b_{h}\\left ( t\\right ) b_{h}\\left ( s\\right ) \\right ] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left\\ { \\left| t\\right| ^{2h}+\\left| s\\right| ^{2h}-\\left| t - s\\right| ^{2h}\\right\\ } \\label{2.11}\\ ] ] and , for @xmath41 , a long range dependence @xmath42    therefore , mathematical simplicity suggested the identification of the @xmath43 process with fractional brownian motion .",
    "@xmath44 and , from the data , one obtains hurst coefficients in the range @xmath45 .",
    "finally one obtains the following _ fractional volatility model _    @xmath46    @xmath47 is a volatility intensity parameter and @xmath48 is the observation time scale .",
    "notice that the volatility is not driven by fractional brownian motion but by fractional noise , naturally introducing an observation scale dependence .      at each fixed time @xmath49 is a gaussian random variable with mean @xmath50 and variance @xmath51 .",
    "then , @xmath52 therefore    @xmath53    with @xmath54 thus , the effective probability distribution of the returns might depend both on the time lag @xmath55 and on the observation time scale @xmath56 used to construct the volatility process . that this latter dependence might actually be very weak ,",
    "seems to be implied by comparison with the data from several markets .",
    "a closed - form expression for the returns distribution and its asymptotic behavior may be obtained , namely @xmath57 with asymptotic behavior , for large returns @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60    some illustrative comparisons with market data were performed . in fig.1 nyse",
    "one - day data was used to fix the parameters of the volatility process .",
    "then , using @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 , the one - day return distribution predicted by the model is compared with the data .",
    "the agreement is quite reasonable . for comparison a log - normal with the same mean and variance",
    "is also plotted in fig.1 .",
    "then , in fig .",
    "2 , using the same parameters , the same comparison is made for the @xmath65 and @xmath66 data .",
    "3 shows a somewhat surprising result . using the same parameters and just changing @xmath67 from @xmath68 ( one day ) to @xmath69 ( one minute ) , the prediction of the model",
    "is compared with one - minute data of usdollar - euro market for a couple of months in 2001 .",
    "the result is surprising , because one would not expect the volatility parametrization to carry over to such a different time scale and also because one is dealing with different markets .    in fig.4 and",
    "fig.5 one sees the same one - day and one - minute return data discussed before , as well as the predictions of the model , both in semilogarithmic and loglog plots .    as seen from figs . 4 and 5 , the exact result ( [ 3.10 ] ) or ( [ 3.15 ] ) resembles the double exponential distribution recognized by silva , prange and yakovenko@xcite as a new stylized fact in market data .",
    "the double exponential distribution has been shown , by dragulescu and yakovenko@xcite , to follow from heston s @xcite stochastic volatility model .",
    "notice however that our model is different from heston s model in that volatility is driven by a process with memory ( fractional noise ) . as a result , despite the qualitative similarity of behavior at intermediate return ranges , the analytic form of the distribution and the asymptotic behavior are different",
    ".      new option pricing pricing formulas may be obtained from the model both in a simplified risk - neutral form or , more accurately , using fractional malliavin calculus .",
    "assuming risk neutrality @xcite , the value @xmath70 of an option is the present value of the expected terminal value discounted at the risk - free rate @xmath71 @xmath72 $ ] and the conditional probability for the terminal price depends on @xmath13 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is the strike price , @xmath75 the maturity time and @xmath13 and @xmath23 the price and volatility of the underlying security .    in stochastic volatility models ( with or without fractional noise )",
    "risk - neutrality is not an accurate assumption .",
    "nevertheless it provides an approximate estimate of the deviations from black - scholes implied by the fractional volatility model . as in hull and white @xcite ,",

    "the other parameters are fixed at @xmath92 . to compare the predictions of the option pricing formula ( [ 4.16 ] ) with the classical black - scholes ( bs ) result@xcite @xcite , the implied volatility required in bs to reproduce the same results",
    "was computed .",
    "this is plotted in the lower right panel of fig.6 which shows the implied volatility surface corresponding to @xmath79 for @xmath90 .",
    "one sees that , when compared to bs , it predicts a smile effect with the smile increasing as maturity approaches .",
    "the following nonlinear correlation of the returns @xmath93 is called _ leverage _ and the _ leverage effect _ is the fact that , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 starts from a negative value and decays to zero whereas for @xmath96 it has almost negligible values .",
    "fig.7 shows @xmath95 computed for the nyse  index one - day data in the period 1966 - 2000 .",
    "the leverage behavior of the fractional volatility model will now be examined . for this purpose",
    "it will be convenient to use the following integral representation of fractional brownian motion @xcite .",
    "@xmath97 db\\left ( s\\right ) + \\int_{0}^{t}\\left ( t - s\\right ) ^{h-\\frac{1}{2}}db\\left ( s\\right ) \\right\\ } \\label{4.11}\\ ] ] using this representation the fractional volatility model may be rewritten as @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 different brownian processes . in fig.8",
    "one shows the leverage @xmath95 computed for the model ( [ 4.12 ] ) with @xmath50 and @xmath101 chosen to match the statistical parameters of the nyse  index .",
    "both the @xmath102 and the @xmath103 cases are considered .",
    "one sees that for @xmath102 there is no leverage effect , whereas for @xmath104 an effect is found .",
    "therefore one sees that , identifying the random generator of the log - price process with the stochastic integrator of the volatility , at least a part of the leverage effect is taken into account .",
    "many factors play a role in a real market . to take into account all the factors in a model is neither possible nor , in many cases , illuminating .",
    "the objective is to isolate some of the more relevant mechanisms that presumably play a role in the market and , by stripping the model from other ( inessential ? ) complications , to exhibit and understand the _ purified _ effect of these factors . as in other branches of science ,",
    "the splitting apart of the dynamical components of a phenomena , may improve its understanding @xcite .",
    "two stylized models will be considered . in the first the traders strategies",
    "play a determinant role . in the second the determinant effect",
    "is the limit - order book dynamics , the agents having a random nature .      a market model with either random self - adapted strategies or fixed strategies was studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the dominance of two types of strategies was to a large extent determined by the initial conditions .",
    "different types of return statistics corresponded to the relative importance of either value investors or technical traders .",
    "the occurrence of market bubbles also corresponded to situations where technical trader strategies were well represented .    here",
    ", that model will be used for comparison purposes with the fractional volatility parametrization .",
    "the basic ingredients of the model are summarized below :    one considers a set of investors playing _ against _ the market , that is , they have some effect on an existing market that is influenced by other factors ( other investors and general economic effects ) .",
    "this assumption implies that in addition to the impact of this group of investors on the market , the other factors are represented by a stochastic process .",
    "therefore @xmath105 represents the change in the log price @xmath106 with @xmath107 being the total investment made by the group of traders and @xmath108 the stochastic process that represents all the other factors .",
    "no conservation law is assumed for the total amount of _ stock _ @xmath109 and _ cash _",
    "@xmath110 detained by the group of traders . if @xmath111 is the price of the traded asset at time @xmath11 , the purpose of the investors is to have an increase , as large as possible , of the total wealth @xmath112 at the expense of the rest of the market .",
    "the collective variable is @xmath113 and each investor payoff at time @xmath11 is @xmath114    * market impact *    let @xmath115 be the price of a representative asset , @xmath116 and @xmath117 the total sum of the buying and selling orders ( in money units ) for the asset .",
    "buying orders are positive and selling ones negative .",
    "the effect of these orders on the price change of the asset is called the _ market impact function_. let small orders have an impact according to the loglinear law@xcite",
    "@xcite @xmath118 the constant @xmath119 , is sometimes called the _ liquidity_. eq.([5.12 ] ) corresponds naturally to a first order expansion and satisfies the condition @xmath120 which is expected to be valid for small orders .",
    "however , as pointed out by zhang@xcite there is experimental evidence that this is not an accurate representation for large orders . therefore a slightly different market impact function will be used .",
    "the reasoning used to motivate it , has some relation to zhang s although the result is somewhat different .    when using eq.([5.12 ] ) in a discrete - time dynamical model we are somehow neglecting the fact that the market takes different times to fulfill ( and to react to ) small and large orders .",
    "therefore this should be taken into account when reducing the dynamics to a sequence of equal time steps .",
    "in particular , the reaction of the market may be parametrized by a change in the @xmath119 coefficient which , being also related to some stochastic process , may vary by a factor proportional to @xmath121 . taking the time @xmath11 to fill an order to be proportional to its size , one obtains @xmath122 this price impact function",
    "was first proposed in @xcite with @xmath123 . for small orders it recovers the loglinear approximation and for very large orders ( and @xmath124 ) zhang s square root law .    *",
    "the agent strategies *    in first - order , two main types of informations are taken into account by the investors , namely the difference ( misprice ) between price and perceived value @xmath125 @xmath126 and the variation in time of the price ( the price trend ) @xmath127 consider now a non - decreasing function @xmath128 such that @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "two useful examples are @xmath131 the information about misprice and price trend is coded on a four - component vector @xmath132@xmath133 the strategy of each investor is also a four - component vector @xmath134 with entries @xmath135 @xmath136 or @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath137 means to sell , @xmath68 means to buy and @xmath138 means to do nothing .",
    "hence , at each time , the investment of agent @xmath139 is @xmath140 .",
    "a _ fundamental _",
    "( value - investing strategy ) that buys when the price is smaller than the value and sells otherwise would be @xmath141 and a pure _ trend - following _ strategy would be @xmath142 .",
    "in this setting the total number of possible strategies is @xmath143 .",
    "the strategies will be labelled by numbers @xmath144 therefore the fundamental strategy is strategy no .",
    "@xmath145 and the pure trend - following one is no .",
    "@xmath146 .",
    "an evolution dynamics may be implemented in the model in the following way . after a number @xmath147 of time steps , @xmath109 agents copy the strategy of the @xmath109 best performers and , at the same time , have some probability to mutate that strategy .",
    "this evolution aims at attaining the goal of improving gains , while at the same time allowing for some renewal of the strategies .",
    "the percentage of each strategy changes in time and one may find whether some of them become dominating or stable and when this may occur .",
    "the model was run with different initial conditions and with or without evolution of the strategies .",
    "the following results were obtained in @xcite :    - when in the initial condition all traders have the fundamental strategy and evolution is activated , this strategy stays dominant , not being invaded by any other of the strategies that are created by the mutation process .",
    "there are however a few other strategies that , after being created , survive the selection process .",
    "this is true for example for the strategies @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "these surviving strategies are however similar to the fundamental one .",
    "when there is dominance of the fundamental strategies , the price increments @xmath152 have a gaussian distribution .",
    "- the fundamental strategy ceases to be stable if it occurs in the initial condition in smaller amounts @xmath153 .    - for a completely random mixture of strategies in the initial condition , although the selection mechanism still favors at each evaluation cycle the best performers , the system never organizes itself to make the total payoff of this group of traders to grow , nor does a clear dominant strategy emerges .    - when the simulation is run without evolution , with a fixed @xmath154 of fundamental strategies ( no . 72 ) and @xmath154 of trend - following ones ( no .",
    "60 ) , one sees a large number of bubbles and crashes in the price evolution and the price increments distribution has fat tails .",
    "because this last case is the one where the returns statistics is closer to the actual market data , it is here further analyzed to see whether it also displays the other features of the fractional volatility model . from typical",
    "simulation runs one computes @xmath155 @xmath156 and @xmath157 fig.9 shows a typical plot of the price process @xmath158 , the volatility , @xmath35 and @xmath159 obtained from the model with equal amounts of _ fundamental _ @xmath160 and _ trend - following _ @xmath161agents and no evolution .",
    "one notices the lack of scaling behavior of @xmath35 with an asymptotic exponent @xmath162 , denoting the lack of memory of the volatility process .",
    "this might already be evident from the time behavior of @xmath35 in the lower left plot . also , although the returns have fat tails in this case , they are of different shape from those observed in the market data .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained with other combinations of agent strategies . in conclusion",
    ": it seems that the features of the fractional volatility model are not easily captured by a choice of strategies in an agent - based model .",
    "notice however that what the fractional volatility model parametrizes is the bulk of the market data , that is , the behavior of the market in normal days .",
    "the agents reactions and strategies are very probably determinant during market crisis and market bubbles .",
    "here one considers a limit - order book where _ asks _ and _ bids _ arrive at random on a window @xmath163 $ ] around the current price @xmath115 . every time a _ buy _ order arrives it is fulfilled by the closest non - empty ask slot , the new current price being determined by the value of the ask that fulfills it .",
    "if no ask exists when a buy order arrives it goes to a cumulative register to wait to be fulfilled .",
    "the symmetric process occurs when a _ sell _ order arrives , the new price being the bid that buys it . because the window around the current price moves up and down , asks and bids that are too far away from the current price are automatically eliminated .",
    "sell and buy orders , asks and bids all arrive at random .",
    "the only parameters of the model are the width @xmath164 of the limit - order book and the size @xmath165 of the asks and bids , the sell and buy orders being normalized to one .",
    "the model was run for different widths @xmath164 and liquidities @xmath165 and , for comparison with the fractional volatility model , one computes as before @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "although the exact values of the statistical parameters depend on @xmath164 and @xmath165 , the statistical nature of the results seems to be essentially the same .",
    "fig.10 shows typical plots of the price process @xmath158 , the volatility , @xmath35 and @xmath159 obtained for @xmath168 and the limit - order book divided into @xmath169 discrete price slots with @xmath170 .",
    "the scaling properties of @xmath43 are quite evident from the lower right plot in the figure , the hurst coefficient being @xmath171 .",
    "fig.11 shows the correlation and the pdf of the one - time returns . from these results",
    "one concludes that the main statistical properties of the market data ( fast decay of the linear correlation of the returns , non - gaussianity and volatility memory ) are already generated by the dynamics of the limit - order book with random behavior of the agents .",
    "this implies , as pointed out by some authors that in the past have considered limit order book models @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , that a large part of the market statistical properties ( in normal business - as - usual days ) depends more on the nature of the price fixing financial institutions than on particular investor strategies .",
