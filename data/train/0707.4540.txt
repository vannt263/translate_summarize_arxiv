    "the serendipitous arrangement of a pulsating star in an eclipsing binary system represents a unique laboratory for astrophysical measurements .",
    "the binarity constrains the physical and geometrical parameters of the system , and can also assist in mode identification in the pulsations . since the pulsating star and non - pulsating companion can reasonably be assumed to have formed from the same parent cloud , we can utilise information from the non - pulsating companion in identifying stellar evolution models for pulsating stars .",
    "we present here the first known example of a high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  ( hads ) star in an eclipsing binary system , designated unsw - v-500 .",
    "@xmath0 scuti  stars are the main - sequence analogues of cepheid variables .",
    "they are late a to early f spectral type , and pulsate with periods of between 16 hours .",
    "they are typically on or slightly above the main - sequence .",
    "low - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  stars typically pulsate in many higher , non - radial modes simultaneously with amplitudes of less than 0.05 mag .",
    "high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  pulsate primarily in the radial modes and have higher amplitudes , with the conventional cut - off given as @xmath8 mag .",
    "[ fig : hr ] shows the @xmath0 scuti  region of the hr diagram ; high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  stars are constrained to a narrower range in @xmath9 of width @xmath10300 k within this region . the subset of low metallicity population ii hads stars are designated as sx phe stars .",
    "prior to the discovery of unsw - v-500 , all bright field hads stars were identified as pulsating in the fundamental radial mode . a significant fraction ( @xmath1040 per cent )",
    "are double - mode pulsators , additionally pulsating in the radial first overtone mode @xcite .",
    "however , sx phe stars have been identified in globular clusters as pulsating in the first overtone rather than the fundamental mode @xcite .",

    "the solid triangles are data from table 4 of @xcite .",
    "the open circles are high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  stars from table 2 of @xcite .",
    "unsw - v-500 is shown as an open square .",
    "the observational red and blue edges of the classical instability strip are shown , as well as the theoretical zero - age main sequence.,width=302 ]    @xcite present a list of 25 confirmed eclipsing binary systems with pulsating components in the @xmath0 scuti  region of the instability strip .",
    "all of these have low pulsation amplitudes , ranging from @xmath11 0.0070.02 mag and up to @xmath12 0.06 mag .",
    "three systems that have been studied in detail are y cam @xcite , as eri @xcite and ab cas @xcite .",
    "parameters of these systems are shown in table [ tab : ebs ] , with the parameters of unsw - v-500 shown for comparison .",
    "we note that although 35 @xmath0 scuti  stars in eclipsing binary systems have been identified ( 25 in @xcite ; 9 recently in @xcite ; and the subject of this paper ) , unsw - v-500 is the first hads star .",
    "this is a curious statistic , since with larger amplitudes , surveys might be expected to be observationally biased towards finding hads stars in these systems . a census of the rodr ' iguez , l ' opex - gonz ' alez & lpez de coca ( 2000 ) catalogue shows that the detected fraction of hads stars is @xmath1025 per cent of the total @xmath0 scuti  population .",
    "one assumes that this fraction is influenced by the same observational selection bias affecting the detection of hads stars in eclipsing binary systems ; we are seeing a detection rate nearly an order of magnitude below this .",
    "however , it is difficult to draw conclusions from the small numbers of binary systems that have been found .    [",

    "[ fig : lc ] shows the best - fitting solution . the high inclination ( @xmath13 ) is indicated by the flat bottom of the primary eclipse .",
    "in fact this is the first eclipsing binary system containing a pulsating component to demonstrate a flat - bottomed eclipse , with the possible exception of the recent discovery of the pulsating component of hd 99612 @xcite .",
    "the normalised third light contribution is found to be 0.096 at the reference phase of 0.25 .",
    "we note that the log @xmath14 values that have been derived in the wilson - devinney fit ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the primary and secondary components respectively ) confirm the estimated values from the synthetic template fitting ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : spec ] .    from the @xmath9 and",
    "derived mass we have identified the two components as a late a spectral type primary , confirming the a7v classification , and a late k spectral type secondary . using the derived parameters",
    ", we attempted to fit the positions of the two components in the hr diagram with the y@xmath19 isochrones @xcite in order to find an age estimate for the system .",
    "however , we found that the isochrones and evolutionary tracks were unable to reproduce the current positions of the components ; hence we conclude that there has been significant mass transfer to the pulsating primary component from the secondary component .",
    "this component appears in a much more evolved state despite its lower mass , a well - recognized phenomenon known as the algol paradox .",
    "we caution that standard evolution and pulsation models for hads stars may not apply to unsw - v-500 due to its binary evolution .",
    "however , we do note that it is well described by the ml3 mass - luminosity relation for hads stars shown in fig . 1 of @xcite , which is based on models with a metal content of @xmath20 .",
    "once the binary solution has been subtracted , an analysis of the @xmath0 scuti  pulsation can be performed .",
    "we have used data from phase 0.1 to 0.9 for this analysis , discarding those data around the primary eclipse where the hads star is completely eclipsed .",
    "this reduces the total number of data points by 700 , or @xmath1025 per cent .",
    "the residuals from the binary subtraction between phase 0.1 to 0.9 are shown in fig .",

    "the dominant frequency is identified as @xmath6 cd@xmath7 , i.e. a period of @xmath21 d , which is typical for @xmath0 scuti  stars .",
    "the four additional frequencies identified with a s / n @xmath22 4.0 , as suggested by @xcite , are shown in panel ( c ) , after removal of @xmath23 .",
    "these can be identified as low - power frequencies , probably due to artefacts of the binary subtraction ( @xmath24 cd@xmath7 and @xmath25 cd@xmath7 ) , or harmonics of @xmath23 ( @xmath26 cd@xmath7 and @xmath27 cd@xmath7 ) .",
    "the absence of any additional frequencies in the @xmath0 scuti  range supports the identification of a hads star oscillating in a single radial mode to the limits of our detection .    as an additional check",
    ", these frequencies were removed from the original data .",
    "the resulting light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , offset below the original data .",
    "the wilson - devinney code was re - run using this second light curve , with no significant change in the derived parameters .    using the relation from @xcite",
    ", we can calculate the pulsation constant @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29    we find a @xmath28 of 0.025@xmath300.001 .",
    "@xcite derived theoretical pulsation constants of @xmath31 for the fundamental radial mode , @xmath32 for the first overtone radial mode , and @xmath33 for the second overtone radial mode .",
    "inspection of the hads stars catalogued in @xcite reveals that of the 26 well studied field stars , all have observed pulsation constants in the range 0.03090.331 , indicating they are pulsating in the fundamental mode .",
    "unsw - v-500 appears to be the first identified to be pulsating primarily in the first overtone radial mode , joining a number of sx phe stars in globular clusters to have been identified in this mode @xcite .     at 13.621 cd@xmath7 .",

    "we have presented here the detection of the first example of a high - amplitude @xmath0 scuti  star in an eclipsing binary system , and the probable first detection of a field hads star pulsating in the single first overtone radial mode .",
    "several hads stars have been detected in binary systems previously ( including sz lyn @xcite with a period of 1190 d ; and rs gru @xcite with a period of approximately 2 weeks ) , however these are much wider systems .",
    "this new fully eclipsing binary opens up many further opportunities for studies of hads stars and pulsating stars in binary systems .",
    "many of the poorly understood processes governing the effects of mass transfer , tidal interactions , rotation , convection and magnetism on @xmath0 scuti  pulsations may be explored with this system .",
