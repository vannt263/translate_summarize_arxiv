    "since the first measurements of earth disk - averaged reflectance spectra ( @xcite ) , several attempts have been successful in the same spectral bandwidth ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these spectra show signatures of earth atmosphere and ground vegetation .",
    "green vegetation has a much higher reflectivity ( factor of 5 typically ) in the near - ir than in the visible which produces a sharp feature at @xmath1 , the so - called vegetation red - edge ( vre ) .",
    "earth disk - averaged reflectance spectrum rises by a few percents at this wavelength .",
    "the red part ( above 600 nm ) of the earth reflectance spectra also shows the presence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the bluer part ( 320 nm to 600 nm ) clearly shows the huggins and chapuis ozone ( @xmath4 ) absorption bands .",
    "spectra show that our planet is blue due to rayleigh scattering , but also that earth can be almost perfectly white depending on the importance of the cloud coverage .",
    "the observations have been made at the ntt / la silla telescope ( 3.5 m ) on july 24th and september 18th 2004 for the descending moon and may 31st and june 2nd 2005 for the ascending moon ( table [ data ] ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the emmi spectrograph in the medium dispersion mode in the blue ( blmd mode ) and in low dispersion in the red ( rild mode ) , enabling us to record a complete spectra from 320 nm to 1020 nm , except for a 20 nm gap around 520 nm .",
    "the spectral resolution is r@xmath5450 in the blue and r@xmath5250 in the red . to record both earthshine ( es ) and sky background spectra simultaneously , emmi s long slit is oriented east - west on lunar limb ( @xcite ) .",
    "es exposures are bracketed by at least two exposures of the bright moonshine ( ms ) with the slit oriented north - south .",
    "the length of the slit ( 6-arcmin in blue and 8-arcmin in red modes ) allows to sample the moon spectrum over a large lunar region giving a correct mean of the moon spectrum .",
    "ms spectra are recorded through a neutral density in the blue arm and a diaphragm in the red arm ( unfortunately the diaphragm could not be put exactly in a pupil plan , resulting in a strong vignetting - no neutral density was available in the red ) .",
    ".dates of observations [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     we observed that the estimation of the vre is strongly dependent on how both rayleigh scattering and ozone chapuis band are estimated in the earth reflectance ( see figure [ fit ] ) .",
    "the amount of @xmath4 is optimized by minimizing the variance between the surface reflectance and the rayleigh fitting on identified continuum bands .",
    "we noticed that the vre measured directly from the er give different values from those measured from sr , pointing out the relevance of telluric lines correction .",
    "for example , we have a vre on er slightly higher than on sr ( 10 and 9% respectively ) the 06/02/2005 , but lower on er than on sr ( 5% and 8% respectively ) the 05/31/2005 .",
    "the suppression of the @xmath3 absorption lines remains difficult .",
    "as shown figure [ fit ] , the band between 930 to 960 nm is over - corrected while other lines remain under - corrected .",
    "this results in an error in the vre estimation due to uncorrected ( or poorly corrected ) @xmath3 absorption between 555 and 560 nm , and also in a reduction of the clean continuum window between 585 and 600 nm available to fit the rayleigh scattering .    to accurately fit the whole spectrum with a rayleigh scattering law",
    ", we can not consider the band between 530 and 560 nm as a clean continuum because vegetation reflectance has a small bump in this domain .",
    "if this domain is nevertheless taken into account for the rayleigh fit , the obtained fit is significantly above the blue part of the spectrum . on the other hand",
    "if it is not taken into account the fit is slightly below the spectrum between 530 and 560 nm , suggesting the presence of vegetation .",
    "but measurements are not consistent with the vre measured at 700 nm upon the pacific ocean and africa . clearly a better model of the atmosphere is needed here .",
    "aerosols scattering following a @xmath6 law could help to solve the problem as it increases the blue part of the spectrum , but it is not yet implemented in the code .",
    "the comparison of spectra in figure [ spectres_albedo ] shows that rayleigh scattering can be almost absent , pointing out the importance of the cloud coverage .",
    "cloud cover is @xmath760% over the evergreen forests meaning that the vre could in principle reach @xmath720% .",
    "but this is unlikely because the cloud cover is always significant above these forest .",
    "but the vegetation cover varies in temperate lands with seasons , and simulations or a one - year monitoring should help to determine the vre seasonal variations and its relevance as a good biomarker .",
    "we obtained spectra of the earth reflectance spanning from 320 to 1020 nm for four different nights .",
    "data show significant variations in rayleigh scattering depending of the cloud cover ( earth blue dot can be white ) .",
    "a spectrum was taken with nearly just the pacific ocean while others with a part or the whole africa and europe .",
    "the vegetation red edge is observed when lands with forests are present , but remains very low otherwise .",
    "measuring the vre requires great cares in the data reduction and , although measurable , the vre remains a small feature when compared to @xmath4 , @xmath2 and water vapor absorption lines . a survey over one year or more with monthly observations would allow to follow vre seasonal variations and improve our knowledge of the behaviour of this biomarker ."
