    "among galactic x - ray binaries , there are about twenty strong candidate or firmly confirmed microquasars that present the extended relativistic radio jets , in which the jet is powered by an accretion of the central compact object .",
    "according to the mass of the companion star , they are classified as the high- and low - mass microquasars . for this kind of x - ray binaries",
    ", it is widely believed that during the low / hard spectral state , radio and infrared ( ir ) emissions originate from synchrotron processes of relativistic electrons in a persistent jet .    in the low / hard state of these x - ray binaries ,",
    "there is still ongoing debate regarding the origin of x - ray emissions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the study of observational and theoretical aspects of microquasars , particularly in the gev and tev domains , is a very active topic . from an observational point of view , five sources ( including confirmed and candidate microquasars ) are detected at high - energy ( gev ) bands by the _ fermi _",

    "these gamma - ray detections imply that extreme particle acceleration is at work in these systems . however , none of these detected gamma - ray sources is a low - mass microquasar .",
    "one possible reason is that these systems can not exactly produce any gev and tev photons , as a result of the expected inefficient effect of a low - mass companion star .",
    "another possible reason is that one has not put forward an observational plan to detect this class of object .",
    "however , they are emitting detectable gamma - ray signature . to our knowledge ,",
    "almost no campaign detecting gamma - rays from a low - mass microquasar is carried out ( however , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    based on leptonic and/or hadronic considerations , many models for jet emissions of high - mass microquasars are proposed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models , the stellar companion plays a key role , providing a seed photon field in a leptonic model or a target for proton  proton / proton  photon interactions in a hadronic one , even resulting in a cascade process",
    ". however , very little attention is focused on the low - mass microquasars , in particular , for gamma - ray productions in a leptonic model . the hadronic model for a low - mass microquasar",
    "is proposed in @xcite , in which theoretical spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from cascade processes induced by relativistic protons , can well extend into pev bands .",
    "subsequently , the further refined models ( called as lepto - hadronic ones ) are developed to investigate the low - mass microquasars gx 3394 @xcite and xte j1118 + 480 @xcite . in these lepto - hadronic models , radio and x - ray emissions",
    "are explained as an origin of the jet , in which seds could predict the detectable emissions at gev and tev bands by _ fermi _ lat and cta .    a recent search on neutrino emission from a sample of six microquasars",
    "is presented in @xcite by the antares neutrino telescope .",
    "this study has provided upper limits of the possible neutrino fluxes , which constrains the scenario that the ratio of proton to electron power is far less than 100 for a hadronic jet model of low - mass microquasars @xcite . besides , almost all the fits to gx 3394 in the lepto - hadronic models need the ratio of proton to electron power close to 1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . in a hadronic or lepto - hadronic model",
    ", protons have to be accelerated to about 10 pev in order to excite hadronic cascade emissions .",
    "such a high energy actually requires the existence of an extreme physical environment .",
    "nevertheless , the requirement for electrons in a hadronic model is relatively loose , that is , the maximum energy of electrons is commonly below tev energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the simulations by particle - in - cell ( pic ) methods demonstrate the presence of very strong coupling between electrons and shock - heated protons @xcite , which implies that the dissipated energies are mostly converted into primary electrons .",
    "furthermore , the recent hybrid pic simulations indicate that it needs a stringent condition for an effective acceleration of protons , that is , only when shocks propagate parallel to the upstream magnetic field @xcite .",
    "given the above analysis and a lower radiative efficiency of protons than that of electrons , the leptonic models appear to be strongly supported over the hadronic ones .",
    "therefore , in this work we carry out a study about broadband emissions of low - mass microquasars in the framework of a pure leptonic model .",
    "we want to know whether a pure leptonic model can also provide the expected gamma - ray emissions as a hadronic one .",
    "it should be noted that there are some works on the jet emission of x - ray binaries in the framework of the leptonic model @xcite .",
    "a common feature is that they considered the effects of radiative and adiabatic cooling of relativistic electrons .",
    "more concretely , @xcite focused on the flat synchrotron spectra of partially self - absorbed jets by considering the different jet geometries , such as ballistic and adiabatic scenarios . by using the electron spectral distribution with a maxwellian shape at low energies plus a power - law tail at high energies , @xcite studied the features of radiative spectra from the jet of x - ray binaries in detail and considered that a single acceleration episode is at work at the base of the jet . in these works , the models can produce multi - wavelength emissions ranging from radio to hard x - ray ( or soft gamma - ray ) bands and do not need to re - accelerate the electrons in the jet .    in particular , except for including the radiative and adiabatic losses of relativistic electrons , we consider the evolution of the relativistic electron along the jet by the kinetic equation .",
    "furthermore , the dissipation region is extended to a large scale of the jet where the maximum energy of ultra - relativistic electrons can be constrained by the first - order _ fermi _ acceleration mechanism .",
    "it is more obvious that the seds in our work can extend into the gev and tev ranges . as an example of application",
    ", we use our model to fit the low - mass microquasar gx 339 - 4 .",
    "the results show that our pure leptonic model can not only provide possible explanations for the current observations , but also predict gev and tev band emissions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "descriptions for a leptonic jet model are presented in section  2 .",
    "numerical results of the model are shown in section  3 .",
    "section  4 is the fitting results to gx 3394 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are given in section  5 .",
    "like the case of active galactic nuclei , the mechanism of jet formation of x - ray binaries remains an open question .",
    "the seminal theoretical works suggested that large - scale magnetic fields anchored in an accretion disk or a black hole induce the generation of jets by means of a magneto - centrifugal mechanism @xcite . according to this mainstream thought , the jet in this work is considered as a poynting flux - dominated one in its innermost region and then converts the magnetic energy into the matter kinetic energy at larger jet height .",
    "however , it is unclear that for a galactic jet , where and how it converts from the poynting flux- to matter - dominated jets and how efficient the conversion is .",
    "it is stated that mhd instabilities are possible trigger mechanisms of the conversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these instabilities could produce the magnetic energy dissipation via shocks or magnetic reconnection , resulting in an acceleration of relativistic particles .    in this study",
    ", we focus on the jet radiative properties rather than its dynamical structure .",
    "we consider that only electrons are accelerated up to relativistic energies and produce emissions .",
    "however , the cold - proton - matter and magnetic energies dominate dynamics of the jet .",
    "the geometry of a low - mass microquasar is the same as a high - mass one . for the latter ,",
    "the high - mass companion has significant effects in the aspect of radiative output , even on dynamical structures of the system .",
    "however , in the current scenario the companion effect to the system is negligible .",
    "the geometry of our jet radiation model is similar to figure 1 of @xcite , which was developed to study the high - mass microquasar cygnus x-1 .",
    "we assume that the steady - state electron distribution in a conical jet is governed by the following kinetic equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the second term of the right - hand side of equation ( [ dgdz ] ) indicates the adiabatic loss of electrons .",
    "the total radiative loss rates of an electron , @xmath17 , include synchrotron , its comptonization , and erc from the disk and corona photons .",
    "it is not clear that which mechanism is operating to accelerate electrons up to relativistic energies",
    ". it could be shock acceleration , stochastic acceleration or magnetic reconnection ( see * ? ? ? * for some discussions ) , or shock interaction in a magnetic reconnection site @xcite .",
    "the diffusive shock acceleration involving the first - order _ fermi _ process is often regarded as the most effective scenario in jets .",
    "however , this process requires that electrons are pre - heated up the value comparable to the energy of thermal ions .",
    "fortunately , a quasi - maxwellian electron distribution with strong coupling with protons has been found in pic simulations of collisionless relativistic @xcite and non - relativistic @xcite shocks .",
    "for the current study , jets are relativistic or should be at leat mildly relativistic .",
    "in fact , the low - energy tail of electrons with a thermal distribution has a relatively small contribution to the seds . on one hand , a sharp low - energy cutoff , @xmath18 , from which electrons can be energized ,",
    "are assumed in @xcite for the jets of black - hole x - ray binaries in the low / hard state . on the other hand ,",
    "a hard injection spectrum below @xmath18 , which could approximate the maxwellian distribution , are used to model a sample of blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly to the latter , the relativistic electrons injected in the dissipation region are considered as @xmath19 where @xmath18 is the break energy of relativistic electrons , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the energy spectral indices of the electrons below @xmath18 and above @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the normalization constant of the electrons , @xmath22 , is determined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the accretion power of the system via roche lobe outflows of the companion star . here , @xmath25 is the mass accretion rate .",

    "the acceleration rate of an electron in an ordered magnetic field @xmath32 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter that characterizes an acceleration efficiency in a dissipation region and @xmath35 is the elementary charge .",
    "the magnetic fields evolve along the jet in the form of @xmath36 .",
    "synchrotron emissions are calculated by using the formulae in @xcite . according to the radiative transfer equation ,",
    "the resulting synchrotron luminosity in solid angle of @xmath37 is given by @xmath38\\frac{1-e^{-\\tau_{\\rm s}}}{\\tau_{\\rm s}},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the pitch - angle averaged synchrotron emissivity and @xmath40 is the optical depth of synchrotron self absorption .",
    "@xmath41 is the number density of electrons in each solid angle .    for numerical calculations of both ssc and erc of disk and corona photons , we used equation ( 14 ) of @xcite .",
    "in practice , we consider a spherical corona with a radius of @xmath42 surrounding the central compact object . here , @xmath43 is a truncation radius of the standard thin accretion disk , and @xmath44 is a gravitational radius of the black hole with a mass of @xmath45 .",
    "it is generally considered that the hard x - ray observations with a power - law spectrum is explained as comptonization of accretion disk photons by hot electrons in the plasma corona . for simplification",
    ", the photon field of the corona is assumed to be a power - law plus an exponential cutoff , @xmath46 . here",
    ", @xmath47 is the maximum energy of the corona photon and the photon index @xmath48 is 1.5 in this work .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath49 are deduced by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the bolometric luminosity of the corona and @xmath52 is a parameter .",
    "we approximate the accretion disk as a planar geometry following @xcite .",
    "the energy density of disk photons in the jet co - moving frame at a height @xmath6 is expressed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 . @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the inner and outer radii of the disk , respectively .",
    "the emission spectra of an accretion disk are calculated following @xcite , together with an irradiation effect of the outer disk by itself inner zone and/or a corona .",
    "detailed treatment of reprocessing of x - rays in the outer accretion disk would involve many parameters and complex processes ; we thus parameterize the reprocessed fraction of bolometric flux with a factor of @xmath57 ( see @xcite , for more details ) .",
    "it is noticed that the temperature for a standard thin disk is @xmath58 .",
    "however , for an irradiation disk , it is @xmath59 .",
    "other model details are the same as those of @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we consider an extended dissipation region that is located in the jet . in this case",
    ", an absorption of high - energy photons can be avoided even if an emission region is very close to the central compact object . as shown in @xcite for the low - mass microquasar gx 3394 , the absorption of tev photons by infrared synchrotron photons is negligible even for a slightly compact dissipation region .",
    "from a research experience of high - mass microquasars , we know that at large jet scales absorptions of high - energy photons by disk and corona photons can be neglected . therefore , the electromagnetic cascade processes due to the internal synchrotron photon , and the external disk and corona photons are not modeled .",
    "in order to test our radiation model , we first explore the evolution of relativistic electrons and multiband seds by using some typical parameters for a general low - mass microquasar . for numerical procedures , interested readers",
    "are referred to @xcite .",
    "the used characteristic parameters for a general low - mass microquasar are given as follows : a mass of black hole of @xmath60 , a distance of @xmath61 , and an accretion rate of @xmath62 yr@xmath63 .",
    "the model parameters are listed in table [ table : cases ] for case a.            the distributions of relativistic electrons as a function of the energy @xmath5 along with the height of the jet @xmath6 are plotted in figure [ figs : elect ] . from the beginning of the injection of relativistic electrons ,",
    "the number of electrons increases with the height of the jet .",
    "it is noticed that when an injection spectrum of electrons is adopted in the form of a broken power law , the resulting electron spectra present the broken form around @xmath64 . at the low - energy limit",
    ", the number of electrons increases with their energies .",
    "however , due to a rapidly cooling of electrons , the number of electrons decreases with their energies at the high - energy limit .",
    "figure [ figs : model ] demonstrates broadband seds for a general low - mass microquasar . as shown in this figure , the emissions from the disk ( including a standard thin disk and the corresponding irradiated disk ) and hot plasma corona contribute radiative fluxes ranging from near - ir through ultraviolet ( uv ) to mev bands .",
    "the synchrotron emission provides radiative fluxes at radio , ir , and about @xmath65 bands .",
    "the ssc spectrum dominates fluxes above @xmath66 .",
    "even though relativistic electrons injected in the jet is at a distance of @xmath67 close to the central compact object , the erc of soft photons of the accretion disk and corona are still negligible .            as a result",
    ", we find that the nonthermal emissions from the jet , e.g. , synchrotron and ssc , dominate the jet radiative outputs .",
    "it is well - known that these two components are mainly governed by electron distributions and a magnetic field strength in an emission region .",
    "therefore we define a magnetization parameter @xmath68 to characterize a role that magnetic fields play in a jet flow , that is , a ratio of magnetic energy density to matter kinetic density . here , @xmath69 is the magnetic energy density in a completely ordered magnetic field and @xmath70 is the kinetic energy density of jet matter . with the values adopted in this numerical test , we find @xmath71 at the initial location of the dissipation region .",

    "in addition , an irradiation disk and jet synchrotron or corona components are alternatively adopted to explain emissions from radio to x - ray bands .",
    "as shown in figures 3 - 6 , this work uses more complete ir , optical and uv data compared with that of maitra et al .",
    "however , ssc component is still loose due to lacking any data above the x - ray band while the current observations can constrain the synchrotron spectrum .    for the case of the corona - dominated x - ray emissions",
    ", locating the dissipation region at sub - equipartition scales is optimistic to gamma - ray productions .",

    "besides , formation of hard power - law distribution ( @xmath100 ) of the energetic particle spectra is derived by 3d pic simulations from relativistic magnetic reconnection @xcite .    from the perspective of energy spectral fitting , many works regarding the jet emissions indeed demonstrate that the power law index is greater than 2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which almost no gamma - ray , especially very high - energy gamma - ray emission is expected . however",
    ", if one expects a pure jet model ( especially in a low - mass x - ray binary ) to produce the entire broadband emissions ranging from radio via optical and x - ray to gev and tev bands , the jet itself needs to provide more energy to the energetic electrons . in this case , a hard power - law index is needed , as shown in figures 5 and 6 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar scenario ) , though one would expect a large power law .",
    "as pointed out in section [ figs : model ] , an expected location of particle acceleration should not be at the base of the jet , in which outflow should be a poynting flux - dominated one . according to the fitting results of gx 3394",
    ", it appears also to support the scenario that the jet emission is away from the central compact object , and at a sub - equipartition region ( see also figures [ figs : break - sub ] and [ figs : single - sub ] ) . in the present work ,",
    "we parameterized the acceleration efficiency as a factor @xmath34 . without a doubt , this overlooks many physical details regarding jets and precludes insight into the jet dynamical properties .",
    "furthermore , in order to obtain the expected maximum energy of relativistic electrons , which mainly decides the condition whether electromagnetic spectra can extend into gamma - ray regimes , we have used the relatively effective efficiency @xmath93 or 0.01 .",
    "for the high x - ray luminosities observed in black - hole x - ray binaries or extragalactic blazars , if their emission fluxes are produced in a jet , a powerful jet with a significant amount of leptonic content is necessary , because electrons have very high radiative efficiency in contrast to protons .",
    "a lepto - hadronic model needs more effective acceleration efficiency than a pure leptonic scenario , that is , it is necessary to make protons accelerate up to about @xmath101 , at which protons can efficiently excite proton ",
    "photon / proton  proton interactions . in practice , because the lepto - hadronic model involves multiple secondary particles promoting cascade processes , it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of each individual component . in this",
    "regard , our leptonic radiation model is more pure .",
