    "it is possible that a fast - moving nearby star in the ogle - ii proper motion catalogue has been falsely cross - identified with a distant red giant star in the denis catalogue .",

    "the increased disagreement between 2mass and denis magnitudes arising from the application of these transformations may therefore be not significant .",
    "we note that blending within the seeing disks of both the 2mass and denis experiments may account for small differences in photometry .",
