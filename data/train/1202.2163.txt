    "the principles in quantum mechanics provide some novel ways for secure communication . since bennett et al .",
    "@xcite published the original quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol in 1984 , quantum communication has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "for example , ekert @xcite proposed a qkd protocol based on two - photon entanglement in 1991 .",
    "subsequently , bennett , brassard , and mermin @xcite simplified its process for eavesdropping check . in 1992 , bennett and wiesner proposed a quantum dense coding protocol between two parties @xcite and it was generalized to @xmath0 parties with arbitrary @xmath1-dimensional quantum systems by liu _",
    "@xcite in 2002 . in 1993 , bennett _ et al .",
    "_ proposed a quantum teleportation protocol @xcite for transmitting an unknown single - qubit state , without moving the qubit itself by setting up a quantum channel with a photon pair in a maximally entangled state . in 1999 ,",
    "hillery , buek , and berthiaume @xcite presented an interesting quantum secret sharing protocol based on multipartite photon systems in a maximally entangled state .",
    "subsequently , it is generalized to the case with two - photon entangled channels @xcite , arbitrary number of agents @xcite , and that to sharing an unknown quantum state @xcite with a quantum channel in a multipartite maximally entangled state . in 2002 ,",
    "long and liu @xcite proposed the first quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) protocol with a block of two - photon systems in bell states .",
    "it was detailed in the two - step qsdc protocol @xcite and was generalized to the case with sing photons @xcite and high - dimensional entangled quantum systems @xcite .",
    "although there are some interesting quantum communication protocols , including those based on single photons @xcite or weak pulses @xcite , quantum repeaters are required in long - distance quantum communication @xcite because quantum signals can only be transmitted over an optical fiber or a free space not more than several hundreds kilometers with current technology . in a quantum repeater , entanglement is used to connect the two neighboring nodes .",
    "that is , the distribution of entanglement between two nodes is necessary for a quantum repeater .",
    "moreover , the parties should store the quantum state for linking the other nodes in quantum communication network . in a practical transmission of a photon system",
    ", it will inevitably interact with its environment .",
    "that is , it will suffer from the channel noise . in the storage of the entangled quantum state , the decoherence will also decrease the entanglement of the system .",
    "the decoherence of the entangled quantum system will decrease the security of qkd protocol and even make a quantum teleporation and a quantum dense coding protocol fail .",
    "entanglement purification is used to extract a subset of high - fidelity entangled systems from a set of less - entangled systems in a mixed state . since bennett et al .",
    "@xcite proposed the first entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) in 1996 , many works were focused on it and many important epps have been proposed , resorting to different physical systems @xcite .",
    "compared with an epp , an entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) is usually more efficient for the two parties in quantum communication , say alice and bob , to distill some maximally entangled systems from an ensemble in a less - entangled pure state .",

    "subsequently , shi et al .",
    "@xcite presented a different ecp based on entanglement swapping and a collective unitary evolution .",
    "both these ecps @xcite require that alice and bob know the information about the less - entangled pure state @xmath2 . here",

    "both these ecps @xcite do not require that alice and bob know the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",

    "the charge detector ( c ) can distinguish the occupation number one from the occupation numbers 0 and 2 , but it can not distinguish the electron numbers between 0 and 2 .",
    "that is , it can distinguish the occupation number even or odd , which means that this device can distinguish the even parity states @xmath11 and @xmath12 from the odd parity states @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in detail , as the spin polarizing beam splitter ( pbs : 50/50 ) can transmit an electron in the spin - up state @xmath15 and reflect an electron in the spin - down state @xmath16 , one can see that the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 will lead the charge detection to have the charge occupation number @xmath19 as each electron passes through a different path after the first pbs .",
