    "isotopic abundances ( n@xmath7 ) @xcite and the elemental abundances measured for metal - poor halo stars ( for a review , see e.g. @xcite ) , meteoritic grains of stardust , which survived from times before the s.s . formed ( see ,",
    "e.g. @xcite ) represent the third group of `` observables '' crucial for our understanding of the various nucleosynthesis processes in stars . within the realm of meteoritc grains , attempts to explain the origin of nanodiamonds",
    "have not progressed as much as the understanding of other types of stardust , such as for example sic and oxide grains .",
    "a major problem is the small size ( average @xmath82.6 nm ) , which does not permit classical single - grain isotopic measurements .",
    "therefore , `` bulk '' samples ( i.e. millions of tiny nanodiamond grains ) have to be analyzed . in nanodiamonds ,",
    "peculiar isotopic features have been observed in several trace elements , which seem to suggest a connection to sne .",
    "these include xe - hl @xcite ( with enhancements of light ( l ) p- and heavy ( h ) r - isotopes relative to n@xmath7 ) , kr - h and pt - h @xcite ( where the heavy ( h ) isotopes are enhanced ) , and te - h @xcite ( with a clear overabundance of the `` r - only '' isotopes ) .",
    "so far , nucleosynthesis processes suggested to account for the h r - process enhancements include `` neutron - burst '' scenarios of secondary nature @xcite , as well as a regular primary r - process augmented by an `` early '' separation between final , stable isotopes and radioactive isobars formed during the @xmath9-decay back to stability from the initial precursors in the assumed r - process path @xcite . since both earlier scenarios are not fully convincing , as a possible alternative we have initiated a concerted effort to look for isotopic features that may be diagnostic for non - standard variants of an r - process in high - entropy - wind ( hew ) ejecta of core - collapse ( cc ) sne ( for details of the hew scenario , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the basic nucleosynthesis mechanisms for elements beyond fe by slow ( s - process ) and rapid ( r - process ) captures of neutrons have been known for a long time @xcite . however , the search for a robust r - process production site has proven difficult . still today , all proposed scenarios not only face problems with astrophysical conditions , but also with the necessary nuclear - physics input for very neutron - rich isotopes . among the various suggested sites ,",
    "the neutrino - driven or high - entropy wind ( hew ) of cc - sne is one of the best studied mechanisms for a full primary r - process already in the early universe ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , also for this attractive scenario even in the most sophisticated hydrodynamical models the neutrino - driven hew has been found to be proton - rich ( electron fraction y@xmath0 @xmath10 0.5 ) during its entire life , thus precluding a rapid neutron - capture process ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , recent work on charged - current neutrino interaction rates ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , seems to revive the hew scenario by predicting that y@xmath0 changes from an initially proton - rich value to moderately neutron - rich conditions with minimal values of y@xmath0 @xmath8 0.42 .",
    "+ therefore , in the light of these recent findings , to us it appears to be justified of further using our parameterized , dynamical hew approach , based on the initial model of freiburghaus et al .",
    "@xcite , which assumes adiabatically expanding homogenious mass zones with different entropy ( s ) yields .",
    "this code has been steadily improved until today , for example to implement a better mathematical treatment for the tracking of the @xmath9-decaying nuclei back to stability with time - intervals small enough to consider late recaptures of previously emitted @xmath9-delayed neutrons , up to the longer - lived precursors 55-s @xmath11br and 24-s @xmath12i . +",
    "as has been outlined in @xcite , in our hew model the overall wind ejecta represent model - inherently weighted superpositions of s ( and probably also y@xmath0 ) components , where the main astrophysical parameters are correlated via the `` r - process strength formula '' ( y@xmath13/y@xmath14 @xmath8 k@xmath15 @xmath16 v@xmath1 @xmath16 ( s / y@xmath0)@xmath17 ) .",
    "following our traditional approach to find a possible explanation of the n@xmath18 `` residuals ''",
    "@xcite , we have started the present study using our standard parameter combination of y@xmath0 = 0.45 , v@xmath1 = 7500 km / s and the full s - range of 20 @xmath19 s @xmath19 280 k@xmath20/baryon .",
    "as indicated in table  [ tab1 ] , under these conditions we have a `` hybrid '' r - process type with a neutron - freezeout temperature of t@xmath3(freeze ) @xmath8 0.82 , which is reached at a time @xmath2(freeze ) @xmath8 138 ms after the r - process seed formation .",
    "this r - process variant reaches the maximum abundance at the a @xmath8 130 peak at s @xmath8 195 for y@xmath13/y@xmath14 @xmath8 35 with the top of the peak at a = 128 .",
    "thereafter , we have systematically investigated the whole astrophysics parameter space as functions of electron fraction ( 0.40 @xmath19 y@xmath0 @xmath19 0.495 ) , expansion velocity ( 1000 @xmath19 v@xmath1 @xmath19 30,000 km / s ) and entropy ranges . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we show some relevant parameters for the formation of the a @xmath8 130 peak with y@xmath0 = 0.45 and the corresponding full s - ranges for different possible r - process variants , ranging from a `` hot , fast '' version with an r - process boulevard at moderate distance from the stability line , up to a `` cold , rapid '' process with r - progenitors far from stability",

    "all hew calculations were performed with the theoretical nuclear - physics input based on the mass model etfsi - q @xcite and the local qrpa @xcite improvements mentioned in the text . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in the nanodiamond stardust samples , the xe - h abundance pattern is given as ratios relative to the assumed `` r - only '' isotope @xmath5xe , and have ( somewhat model dependent ) values of @xmath21xe/@xmath5xe = 0.207 , 0.178 , 0.167 , 0.699 @xcite . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , these values are clearly different from the n@xmath18 abundance ratios of 3.37 , 2.55 , 2.24 , 1.18 @xcite .",
    "the low measured values of the three lighter ( r+s ) xe isotopes indicate a significant reduction of their abundances by factors of 16.3 , 14.3 and 13.4 , respectively , whereas the abundance ratio of the two heavy `` r - only '' isotopes ( 96.2 % r @xmath22xe and 99.95 % @xmath5xe ) is only moderately changed by a factor 1.7 . in the historical `` neutron - burst '' model of @xcite , this xe abundance pattern has been obtained by a neutron- capture shift of an s - processed seed composition in an explosive shell - burning scenario . in the hew scenario , however , such a strong abundance shift to a peak at n = 82 @xmath5xe , with its main r - progenitor n = 86 @xmath5sn , is very unlikely .",
    "it would require a drastic change of the position and height of the n@xmath18 peak with its classical , most abundant n = 82 `` waiting - point '' isotopes @xmath23pd , @xmath24ag and @xmath25cd ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath9-decaying to the stable isobars @xmath23te , @xmath24xe and @xmath25te .",
    "hence , if a primary rapid neutron - capture process would be the nucleosynthesis origin of the peculiar xe - h pattern , possibilities within more likely non - standard r - process variants have to be investigated .",
    "however , before studying the individual , and later also possible combined effects of the main hew parameters y@xmath0 , v@xmath1 and s , we first have to verify that our r - process model is able to reproduce the isotopic pattern of the whole n@xmath18 peak region . in this context ,",
    "our experimental information on direct r - process progenitor isotopes as well as a detailed understanding of the nuclear - structure development in the n = 82 magic - shell region ( see , e.g. @xcite ) is essential . only with both , realistic astrophysical and nuclear - physics parameters , a satisfactory agreement between s.s .-",
    "r observations and our hew calculations can serve as a `` basis '' for the later interpretation of abundance patterns deviating from the standard n@xmath18 pattern . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we show two fits of the 120 @xmath19 a @xmath19 140 peak region , both with the nuclear - physics input based on the etfsi - q mass model , but the one with older theoretical @xmath9-decay properties , and the other with updated half - lives and p@xmath26 values , as described in arndt et al . @xcite . with the latter , new nuclear - physics input , for the above mass range the mean abundance ratio of n@xmath27/n@xmath18 @xmath8 0.90 . to our knowledge , this is the best agreement one has been able to achieve so far for the region of the 2@xmath28 r - peak .",

    "the calculated values are normalized to the s.s .-",
    "r abundance of @xmath23te . ]",
    "we now want to check the possible influence of the neutron - richness of the r - process ejecta on the @xmath4xe/@xmath5xe abundance ratios .",
    "therefore , we vary the hew parameter y@xmath0 , i.e. the electron fraction , in the range 0.41 @xmath19 y@xmath0 @xmath19 0.49 , while keeping the wind expansion velocity v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] constant and taking the respective full entropy ranges ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show three typical results in comparison with the xe - h measurements @xcite . here , the case y@xmath0 = 0.49 corresponds to only slightly neutron - rich conditions , as observed for r - process poor `` honda - type '' halo stars ( e.g. hd 122563 @xcite ) ; y@xmath0 = 0.45 represents moderately neutron - rich conditions for r - process enriched , metal - deficient `` sneden - type '' stars ( e.g. cs 22892 - 052 @xcite ) ; and y@xmath0 = 0.41 corresponds to strongly neuron - rich , `` cayrel - type '' stars ( e.g. cs 31082 - 001 @xcite ) , which show a `` main '' r - process component with a so - called `` actinide boost '' . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the measured low xe abundance ratios are not met by varying the electron fraction parameter alone .",
    "but , the trend shows that high y@xmath0 values may be less likely than the lower ones .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the xe - h pattern seems to favor neutron - rich hew ejecta .    xe/@xmath5xe abundance ratios for r - process ejecta with different electron fractions y@xmath0 , with a constant expansion velocity v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] and the respective full entropy ranges .",

    "the xe - h data are included for comparison . for further details ,",
    "see text . ]    in a second step , we vary the individual parameter of the hew expansion velocity v@xmath1 in the range 1000 @xmath19 v@xmath1 @xmath19 30,000 [ km / s ] , while now keeping the electron fraction y@xmath0 = 0.45 constant and taking again the full respective entropy ranges ( see also table  [ tab1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show again three typical results in comparison with the xe - h data @xcite . here",
    ", the case v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] corresponds to our `` standard '' hew parameter combination for a `` hybrid '' r - process @xcite ; v@xmath1 = 3000 [ km / s ] represents a moderately fast , `` hot '' r - process ; and v@xmath1 = 15,000 [ km / s ] corresponds to a rapid , `` cold '' r - process variant ( for further details , see @xcite ) . as is evident from this figure , again the measured xe - h abundance ratios are not met by varying the ejection velocities of the r - process ejecta alone .",
    "however , the trend in this case indicates that relatively high v@xmath1 values may be more likely than low ones .",
    "what we do not show here , is our further result that very high v@xmath1 @xmath10 20,000 [ km / s ] may , however , be excluded too .",
    "therefore , we conclude from this hew parameter choice that the xe - h pattern seems to favor rapid , neutron - rich , `` cold '' r - process ejecta .",
    "xe/@xmath5xe abundance ratios for neutron - rich r - process ejecta with different expansion velocities v@xmath1 , with a constant electron fraction y@xmath0 = 0.45 and the respective full entropy ranges .",
    "the case v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] represents our `` standard '' parameter combination for a `` hybrid '' r - process ; v@xmath1 = 3000 [ km / s ] corresponds to a fast , `` hot '' r - process ; and v@xmath1 = 15,000 [ km / s ] represents a rapid , `` cold '' r - process variant . for comparison , again the xe - h data are included . for further details",
    "see text and @xcite . ]",
    "the last hew parameter to `` play '' with in our present study is the range of the superimposed entropy ( s ) components .",
    "from @xcite we know that with increasing s , we can distinguish between three different primary , rapid nucleosynthesis components . in the lowest s - range , where the hew has no or not yet enough `` free neutrons '' ( y@xmath13/y@xmath30 @xmath19 1 ) we have a charged - particle process . for somewhat higher s - values , a relatively low fraction of `` free neutrons '' ( 1 @xmath19 y@xmath13/y@xmath30 @xmath19 20  30 ) occurs , which leads to a `` weak '' neutron - capture process that produces r - matter up to the rising wing of the a @xmath8 130 peak . and finally , for high s - values ( and moderately low y@xmath0",
    "; see above ) high neutron fractions of up to y@xmath13/y@xmath30 @xmath8 150 ) can be obtained , under which conditions a `` main '' r - process component becomes possible .",
    "this r - component forms a robust s.s .-",
    "r like ree `` pygmy peak '' , the full a @xmath8 195 peak , and may reach up to the th and u r - chronometer isotopes .",
    "+     = 0.45 and v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] as a function of entropy s [ k@xmath20/baryon ] .",
    "the xe isotopes are produced in slightly different s - ranges , where @xmath24xe abundance maximum occurs at a lower entropy that those for the heavier isotopes .",
    "for futher details , see text . ]    given this development of s and y@xmath13/y@xmath30 , it is immediately evident that the r - process xe isotopes between @xmath24xe and @xmath5xe are predominantly produced by the `` main '' component , which ( quite logically ) suggests to cut out the low - s ranges of the charged - particle and the `` weak - r '' components . furthermore , a closer look to the production of the individual xe isotopes as a function of s shows , that they are formed under slightly different conditions .",
    "the most significant differences occur for the lightest r - isotope @xmath24xe , which is placed in the left part of the top of the 2@xmath28 r - peak , and the heaviest r - nuclide @xmath5xe , which sits already beyond the right , decreasing wing of the peak , close to the beginning of the ree region . for our `` standard ''",
    "hew parameter combination of y@xmath0 = 0.45 and v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] , this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . from this figure",
    ", it can be seen that @xmath24xe is mainly produced at entropies of s @xmath19 190 ( by the initial , classical n = 82 r - process `` waiting - point '' nuclide @xmath24ag ) , whereas the heavier xe isotopes need higher entropies .",
    "xe/@xmath5xe abundance ratios for different entropy ranges , with constant `` standard '' r - process conditions of y@xmath0 = 0.45 and v@xmath1 = 7500 [ km / s ] , compared to the measured xe - h data .",
    "the results obtained with the cuts of the low - s ranges , in particular the `` best fit '' for s @xmath10 205 , represent the signature of a moderately neutron - rich `` hybrid , main '' r - process variant . for comparison ,",
    "again the xe - h data are included .",
    "for further discussion , see text . ]",
    "this picture now suggests to check the effect of selecting only the high - s components out of the full s - range .",
    "again , for our `` standard '' hew parameter combination for y@xmath0 and v@xmath1 , this is shown in fig .",
    "we see that in particular the high `` overabundance '' of @xmath24xe can be nicely reduced by the requested order of magnitude , while the abundance ratio of the two `` r - only '' isotopes @xmath22xe and @xmath5xe remains practically unaffected . from this result ,",
    "our near - final conclusion is that the measured xe - h pattern seems to be the signature of a moderately neutron - rich , `` hybrid , main '' ( or even `` strong '' ) r - process variant .",
    "xe/@xmath5xe abundance ratios , combining the `` best '' individual astrophysics parameters for y@xmath0 @xmath8 0.43 and the respective s - cuts with different choices of v@xmath1 .",
    "`` best fit '' conditions are obtained for somewhat higher expansion velocities than our standard value , in the range 10,000 @xmath19 v@xmath1 @xmath19 15,000 [ km / s ] .",
    "for further discussion , see text . ]",
    "after we have so far studied the effects of the main individual hew parameters , and have determined their possible optimum values , at the very end we can combine these values and compare the respective abundance predictions to the measured xe - h pattern .",
    "this is shown in our final fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for a limited number of `` best fit '' combinations of y@xmath0 @xmath8 0.43 , the respective low - s cuts and a range of reasonable , but not too high v@xmath1 values .",
    "similar to our result already obtained from the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we conclude that the xe - h abundance ratios indicate its presolar formation by a `` rapid , cold , main '' r - process variant",
    ". the measured abundance ratios of @xmath31xe/@xmath5xe are well reproduced within 20 to 30 % .",
    "only the value of @xmath32xe/@xmath5xe remains too high by about a factor 2.5 .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context , that also the historical  neutron - burst  model @xcite predicted a somewhat too high abundance of @xmath32xe .",
    "+ finally , it is worth to be mentioned that preliminary results for platinum indicate that the hew conditions found to be favorable for xe - h can also account for the reported pt - h in presolar diamonds @xcite . with xe - h lying in the a @xmath8 130 n@xmath18 peak and pt - h in the a @xmath8 195 peak",
    ", these cosmochemical samples with their isotopic abundance patterns can provide constraints on the astrophysical conditions for the production of a full , `` main '' r - process , which can not be deduced with this sensitivity by the elemental abundance patterns of metal - poor halo stars ."
