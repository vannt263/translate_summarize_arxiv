    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is a central concept in all of physics  @xcite .",
    "the quantum collective phenomena induced by zero - point motion of dynamical variables are also ubiquitous  @xcite and the dynamics governed by the quantum fluctuations of the collective degrees of freedom are extremely important for our understanding of macroscopic emergent phenomena  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate a different type of spontaneous symmetry breaking , namely , one in which the macroscopic variables of two interacting many - body systems are locked together through microscopic zero - point quantum fluctuations .",
    "we frame our theory in the context of spinor bose gases  @xcite , where quantum fluctuations can be dominating in energetics or dynamics and are highly controllable  @xcite .",
    "specifically , we consider a mixture of two spinor bose gases with interspecies spin exchanges  @xcite and show that in the symmetry - breaking ground state , the spin directors of the two gases are locked together by the zero - point quantum fluctuations .",
    "the spin director is the spin direction modulo @xmath1 symmetry due to the compensation of the inversion of the spin direction by a @xmath2 phase transformation  @xcite .",
    "our results give more motivation to study interspecies spin exchanges in mixtures of different spinor bose gases  @xcite , which are under experimental investigation  @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .  [ hm ]",
    "we define the many - body hamiltonian , and discuss the mean - field theory . in sec .  [ qf ]",
    "we consider quantum fluctuations and find the energies in the bogoliubov theory . in sec .",
    "[ lock ] we investigate the fluctuation - induced locking between the directors of the two species .",
    "the fluctuation - induced spin dynamics is discussed in sec .",
    "[ spind ] . in sec .",
    "[ trap ] we discuss how the locking effect survives a trapping potential or an external magnetic field .",
    "finally , we summarize our investigation in sec .",
    "the many - body hamiltonian we apply to study this problem is @xmath3 @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of species @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the spin - independent single - particle hamiltonian of each atom of species @xmath5 , @xmath7 is the intraspecies density - density interaction strength of species @xmath5 , @xmath8 is the intraspecies spin - exchange interaction strength of species @xmath5 , and @xmath9 represents the field operator for the @xmath10 component of species @xmath5 , with @xmath11 and @xmath12 or @xmath13 , depending on the basis used . for the case of @xmath14 ,",
    "the @xmath15 component @xmath16 of @xmath17 is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the levi - civit antisymmetric tensor  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath20 is the interaction between the two species , with @xmath21 the interspecies density - density interaction strength and @xmath22 the interspecies spin - exchange interaction strength .",
    "repeated indices are summed over .",
    "we focus on the regime of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and assume that @xmath26 .    the three - component vector field @xmath27 of the species @xmath5",
    "can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spin director , which is also a three - component vector , and @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number - density operator . in terms of @xmath32 and the spin - density operator @xmath33 the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath34 where @xmath35   + \\int d\\mathbf{r}[c_0^{ab}\\rho_a(\\mathbf{r})\\rho_b(\\mathbf{r } ) ] \\end{array}\\ ] ]",

    "henceforth we focus on the spin part @xmath43 .",
    "first consider the uniform case @xmath44 .",
    "in the ground state , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both constants and the total energy @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the volume of the system .",
    "minimization of @xmath49 implies that in the ground state , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are all position independent , while @xmath52 , implying that the total spin is also @xmath53 . the mean - field ground state is @xmath54 denotes the state in which the spin director of each atom of species @xmath5 is aligned along the direction of @xmath29 .",
    "there are no constraints on @xmath41 and @xmath42 , hence the ground state manifold becomes @xmath55 , which possesses a huge degeneracy .",
    "in the following we show that this degeneracy is lifted by zero - point quantum fluctuations . denoted by @xmath56 and @xmath57 ,",
    "the spin directors of the two species in a mean - field symmetry - breaking ground state satisfy the relation @xmath58 .",
    "let us arbitrarily set @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as depicted in fig  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the degeneracy implies that @xmath62 is arbitrary .",
    "the range of @xmath62 is limited to @xmath63 because of @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "consider @xmath64 for @xmath65 , where quantum fluctuations are @xmath66 @xmath67 with unit vectors @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath56 forming a cartesian coordinate system with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 forming another one , as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath79 depends only on @xmath80 , @xmath81 depends on @xmath62 , and @xmath82 is independent of @xmath62 .    by performing a bogoliubov transformation , one obtains @xmath83 where @xmath84 is some bosonic operator and @xmath85^{1/2 } \\big ) ,   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",

    "according to the spectra of @xmath93 and @xmath94 obtained above , we know that the quantum fluctuations lead to a @xmath62-dependent zero - point energy @xmath95 where on the righthand side , the first term @xmath96 is the zero - point energy of @xmath93 , with @xmath97 where @xmath98^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which reaches its minimum at @xmath99 .",
    "the second term @xmath100 on the righthand side of ( [ e00 ] ) , which is @xmath62-independent , is the zero - point energy of @xmath94 .",
    "hence the total zero - point energy @xmath101 also reaches its minimum at @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , in the ground state , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are actually locked in the low - energy limit , that is , they tend to align in the same direction .",
    "this is in contrast to what was suggested by the mean - field analysis .    for large @xmath102 ,",
    "the @xmath62-dependent part of @xmath103 behaves as @xmath104 thus the @xmath62-dependent part of the energy has ultraviolet divergence .",
    "this divergence originates from the use of contact interaction , which fails at short range or large momentum .",
    "it can be removed by introducing a momentum cutoff or by the renormalization of interaction strengths , that is , by evaluating the ground - state energy in terms of the renormalized quantities @xmath105 and @xmath106 , which are directly related to the experimentally observed scattering lengths and correspond to the bare quantities @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "it is known that @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the interaction strengths for the total spin @xmath113 and @xmath114 channels , respectively  @xcite . accordingly",

    "consequently , @xmath126 .",
    "since the divergence occurs in the second order of interaction strengths , we expand the above formula to second order and obtain @xmath127 therefore , @xmath128\\int d^3k\\frac{2 m } { k^2 } , \\label{c0 }          \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is essential for the cancellation of the divergence .",
    "renormalization effect should be considered for all the terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , including those in the mean field energy , in fluctuations of @xmath129 and @xmath130 . in the mean field energy , by substituting ( [ c0 ] ) for @xmath131 in the mean field energy , it can be seen that it becomes @xmath132 after the @xmath133 term cancels the divergent term in the bogliubov ground state energy of @xmath134 , while @xmath135 term cancels the divergent @xmath136 terms in @xmath137 , with exact cancellation at @xmath138 .",

    "it can be shown that after the substraction , @xmath140 and @xmath141 still hold , thus @xmath96 remains minimal at @xmath99 .    without a loss of the generality",
    ", we focus on the case @xmath142 . by introducing @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is a characteristic momentum , we rewrite @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is dimensionless and @xmath147 is also dimensionless and depends on @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and the dimensionless quantity @xmath150 .",

    "the behavior of @xmath96 for various values of @xmath148 was numerically investigated and is shown in fig .",
    "the result indicates that @xmath96 increases with @xmath91 because of the enhancement of spin fluctuations .",
    "the zero - point energy plays the role of an effective potential and can strongly influence the coherent spin dynamics .",
    "although the mean - field spin dynamics has already been studied in quite a few laboratories  @xcite , the macroscopic quantum spin dynamics driven by microscopic quantum fluctuations so far has not yet been explored in experiments and remains to be observed .",
    "the phenomenon studied here provides motivation and a different venue in which to understand fluctuation - induced dynamics .",
    "zero - point energy @xmath96 as a function of the angle @xmath62 between the spin directors @xmath153 and @xmath154 . for simplicity , the dimensionless quantity @xmath155/g$ ]",
    "is shown as the vertical coordinate .",
    "note that @xmath62 is equivalent to @xmath156 because of the @xmath1 symmetry . here",
    "@xmath157 and @xmath158 , with @xmath159 , @xmath160 being the difference between the triplet and singlet scattering lengths for atoms of species @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , @xmath161 is assumed without loss of generality .",

    ", width=377 ]",
    "in the present case , the effective hamiltonian that controls the fluctuations of the spin directors is @xmath166 where @xmath167 . defining the center - of - mass quantities @xmath168 and @xmath169 and the relative quantities @xmath170 and @xmath171 , we can rewrite @xmath172 as @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the center - of - mass part describing a free rotor and @xmath175 is the relative part .",
    "note that @xmath176 and @xmath177 and @xmath178 are decoupled .",
    "let us focus on the relative motion and consider small oscillations around the minimum @xmath99 . to the lowest order",

    "the corresponding frequency of the oscillation about the locked position is about @xmath114hz .",
    "it can be substantially enhanced , even by a few orders of magnitude , when an optical lattice is applied and the amplitude of fluctuation is tuned  @xcite .",
    "more investigations are needed to address this circumstance .",
    "the oscillation of the spin directors results in the oscillation of occupation numbers in the zeeman sublevels . as an example , let us consider the case @xmath192 so that @xmath193 is independent of time . then @xmath194 and @xmath195 thus the spin states of species @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the zeeman basis state of @xmath196 are @xmath197 and @xmath198 while the spin states of species @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the zeeman basis state of @xmath199 are both @xmath200 .",

    "the occupation numbers may be probed by using , say , an optical cavity  @xcite .",
    "now we examine how the locking effect survives a trapping potential , which is an experimental necessity .",
    "supposing that the potential has the harmonic form and the clouds of the two species have the same size @xmath206 , then we have @xmath207 where @xmath208 is a positive constant .",
    "the spin dynamics is determined by the heisenberg equations @xmath209,\\ ] ] @xmath210.\\ ] ] for small fluctuations , we can impose the commutation relations @xmath211= i\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\epsilon^{ijk}\\mathbf{n}^k_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r } ) \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'),\\ ] ] @xmath212 =   i\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\epsilon^{ijk}\\mathbf{l}^k_\\alpha(\\mathbf{r } ) \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'),\\ ] ] where @xmath213 .",
    "one obtains @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 terms are neglected for large clouds . in the thomas - fermi approximation ,",
    "the spin structure for the ground state remains unaffected , thus the fluctuating directors can be generally written as @xmath217 and @xmath218 to first order of @xmath219 and @xmath220 , @xmath221 the two eigenfrequencies are given by @xmath222^{1/2 }   \\big],\\ ] ] where @xmath223 , @xmath224 is the angular quantum number , @xmath225 is the order of a polynomial of even powers describing the radial wave function  @xcite , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229",

    "it can be shown that in the mean - field ground state  @xcite , each species @xmath5 undergoes bose - einstein condensation with the zeeman basis wave function @xmath234 , hence the ground state only possesses spin rotation symmetry @xmath235 , as the two spins can rotate around the @xmath231 axis independently without changing the mean - field energy . due to the zeeman barrier , the low energy dynamics is dominated by the phase fluctuations of @xmath236 and @xmath237 , while @xmath238 remains zero , thus the effective hamiltonian describes a mixture of two pseudospin-@xmath239 bose gases  @xcite . for low enough magnetic fields , the spin fluctuation can overcome the zeeman barrier and",

    ", we have shown that the zero - point quantum fluctuations lift the ground state degeneracy suggested by the mean field theory and lead to the locking between the spin directors of the two species under the experimentally realistic conditions .",
