    "in the paper  @xcite , the game of @xmath1-blocking wythoff nim was introduced , with rules as follows .    * as in wythoff nim  @xcite , two players alternate in removing counters from two heaps : any number may be removed from just one of the heaps , or the same number may be removed from both heaps .",
    "however , a player is allowed to reject the opponent s move ( so the opponent must go back and choose a different , non - rejected move ) , up to @xmath0 times , where @xmath1 is a parameter that is fixed for the game .",
    "the @xmath2 distinct attempted move must be allowed .",
    "thus , if there are at least @xmath1 winning moves among the options from a given position , then one of these winning moves can be played . * there are @xmath1 chess pieces on an infinite ( single quadrant ) chess board : one queen , and @xmath0 pawns . on your turn",
    "you move the queen towards the origin .",
    "( the first player who can not do this loses . )",
    "the queen can not be moved to a position with a pawn , but it can move over pawns to an empty position . after moving the queen ,",
    "you complete your turn by moving the @xmath0 pawns to wherever you like .",
    "the pawns serve to block up to @xmath0 of the queen s possible next moves . *",
    "consider a game with @xmath3 , where the queen is now at @xmath4 ( yellow in figure  [ fig : game5 ] ) .",
    "it is player @xmath5 s turn , and player @xmath6 is blocking the four positions @xmath7 ( dark brown and light olive ) .",
    "this leaves @xmath5 with the options @xmath8 ( each is black or blue ) .",
    "regardless of which of these @xmath5 chooses , @xmath6 will then have at least five winning moves to choose from ( ones marked yellow , or light , medium , or dark olive ) .",
    "these are winning moves because it is possible when moving there to block all possible moves of the other player and thereby immediately win .",
    "therefore player @xmath6 will win .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : game5 ] , there is a simple algorithm to compute the winning positions for game  @xmath1 .",
    "these are known as _ p - positions _ in combinatorial game theory , and we will refer to them as _ palace positions _ , the idea being that the queen wants to move to a palace : if you move her to a palace , you can win , while if you move her to a non - palace , your opponent can win . to win , you must always block ( with pawns ) all of the palaces your opponent might move to .    the idea is simply that a palace is built on any site that can see fewer than @xmath1 other palaces when looking due north , west , or north - west . in this way , the pattern of palaces can be constructed , starting at ( 0,0 ) and going outward . for efficiency ,",
    "a dynamic programming approach can be used , storing three numbers at each position , for the number of palaces visible in each of the three directions . with this technique",
    ", each line can be computed just from the information in the previous line , allowing significant savings in memory usage .",
    "the case @xmath9 corresponds to classical wythoff nim , solved in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "the game was solved for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "when we say a game is solved we mean it is possible to give closed - form expressions for the p - positions , or at least that a winning move , if it exists , can be found in log - polynomial time in the heap sizes . for example , the set @xmath12 , where @xmath13 runs over the nonnegative integers and @xmath14 is the golden ratio , provides a solution for classical wythoff nim .",
    "combinatorial games with a blocking maneuver appears in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and specifically for wythoff nim in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the new idea that we use in this paper is to look directly at the number of palaces that the queen can see from each position on the game board , and to focus on this _ palace number _ rather than just on the palace positions ( p - positions ) .",
    "( the palace positions are exactly the locations with palace numbers less than @xmath1 . ) in previous explorations , the palace number was in fact computed but then only used for finding the new palace positions , which when viewed on their own give the appearance of involving long - range information transfer . by observing the palace number directly , however",
    ", we can see that in almost all positions the palace number is surprisingly close to @xmath1 , and if we look at its deviation from @xmath1 then we are led to discover that these deviations follow a local rule that does not even depend on @xmath1 .",
    "the next section will present this local rule as a cellular automaton ( ca ) .",
    "a finite automaton for wythoff nim has been studied in a different context in @xcite .",
    "other recent results for cellular automata and combinatorial games can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper will present the rich structure visible in the patterns of palace numbers for games with large @xmath1 .",
    "a surprising number regions of self organization appear , largely independent of the particular value of @xmath1 , and some of the self - organized patterns are quite complex , involving multiple layers of self - organization .",
    "this is the first ca we are aware of that exhibits so many levels of self - organization .",
    "so far , these patterns offers many more questions than answers , so for now we will simply try to catalog our initial observations .",
    "in this section we describe a cellular automaton that computes the palace numbers for blocking queen games .",
    "the ca we present is one - dimensional and operates on a diamond space - time grid as shown in figure  [ fig : carule ] , so that at each time step , each cell that is present at that time step derives from two parents at the previous time step , one being half a unit to the right , the other being half a unit to the left . on the diamond grid",
    ", there is no cell from the previous step that is ` the same ' as a given cell on the current step .",
    "however , the three grandparents of a cell , from two steps ago , do include a cell which is at the same spatial position as the grandchild cell .",
    "our ca rule is based not only on the states of the two parent cells , but also on the state of the central grandparent cell , as well as _",
    "its _ parents and central grandparent , all shown in blue in figure  [ fig : carule ] .",
    "as such , this ca depends on the previous four time steps , _",
    "i.e. _  it is a fourth - order ca .",
    "it is the first naturally occurring fourth - order ca that we are aware of .",
    "we say it is `` naturally occurring '' simply because we discovered these pictures by analyzing the blocking queen game , and only later realized that these pictures can also be computed by the fourth - order diamond - grid ca we present here .",
    ", the information for each cell can be computed from just its parents and central grandparent , so that approach is also clearly a ca , but it needs a large number of states for the cells and each different value of @xmath1 requires a different rule .",
    "the ca we describe in this section is much more surprising , being a single rule that is completely independent of @xmath1 and using very few states to produce all of the interesting parts of the pictures . ]",
    "the states in our ca are integers .",
    "in general they are close to 0 , but the exact bounds depend on the initial conditions . the formula for computing a cell s value , given its neighborhood , is described in figure  [ fig : carule ] .",

    "the idea is that the states of this ca correspond to palace numbers minus  @xmath1 , which are generally integers close to zero .",
    "one can easily prove a bound of @xmath36 for the number of states needed for the game with blocking number @xmath1 , since each row , column , and diagonal can have at most @xmath1 palaces , so palace numbers are always in the range @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "however , in practice the number of states needed ( after the initial ramping - up region near the origin ) appears to be far smaller , more like @xmath38 .",
    "for example , when @xmath39 , only eight states are needed , ranging between -4 and 3 .    surprisingly , this single ca is capable of computing the pattern of palace numbers regardless of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "different values of @xmath1 simply require different initial conditions : the initial condition for a given value of @xmath1 is that every site in the quadrant opposite the game quadrant should be @xmath1 , and every site in the other two quadrants should be 0 .",
    "[ thm : ca ] the @xmath1-blocking wythoff nim position @xmath40 is a p - position if and only if the ca given in figure  [ fig : carule ] gives a negative value at that position , when the ca is started from an initial condition defined by @xmath41    first we will consider the case of no p - positions occurring within the ca neighborhood , so compensation terms can be ignored .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : carule ] , we will let @xmath27 be the number of p - positions directly above @xmath17 and @xmath19 , and similarly for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as well as for the diagonals @xmath42 and horizontal rows @xmath43 .",
    "this gives us @xmath44 , and so on : when adding the @xmath1-value to each cell this represents the sum of the numbers of p - positions in the three directions .",
    "we would like to express @xmath23 in terms of the other values .",
    "notice that @xmath45 and therefore @xmath46 , allowing us to express @xmath23 in terms of the other values as @xmath47 .",
    "all that remains is to take any p - positions in the ca neighborhood into account , so as to understand the compensation terms .",
    "if there is a p - position at @xmath17 , then @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath23 ( i.e.  the positions in a line to the right , down , or right - down ) will all be one higher than they were before taking that palace into account . since the equation @xmath46 was true when ignoring the palace at @xmath17 , it becomes wrong when the palace at @xmath17 produces its effect of incrementing @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath23 , because that makes the right hand side go up by 3 while the left hand side is untouched . to compensate for this ,",
    "we can add a term @xmath48 to the left hand side , which is 3 if there is a palace at @xmath17 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "similarly , if @xmath18 is a p - position , then this increments @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , so to compensate , we will need to subtract 2 from the left hand side of @xmath46 if @xmath18 is a p - position .",
    "we can see that we are computing exactly the compensation terms shown in the green squares of figure  [ fig : carule ] .",
    "once we include all the compensation terms , the formula for @xmath23 becomes correct even in the presence of local p - positions , and it corresponds exactly to the rule given in figure  [ fig : carule ] .    the initial condition can be confirmed to produce ( via the ca rule ) the correct values in the first two rows and columns of the game quadrant , and from that point onwards the reasoning given above shows that the correct palace numbers , and therefore the correct p - positions , are being computed by the ca rule .",
    "the reversed version of this ca computes @xmath17 , given @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "this is done with the equation @xmath49 , which is equivalent to the equation in the caption of figure  [ fig : carule ] .",
    "however , the palace compensation term @xmath50 can depend on @xmath17 , so this equation has not fully isolated @xmath17 on the left hand side .",
    "( the forward direction did not have this problem , since @xmath50 does not depend on @xmath23 . ) writing @xmath51 to separate the palace compensation term from @xmath17 from the other palace compensation terms , we get @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath48 is 3 when @xmath17 is negative , and 0 otherwise , this equation always yields either one or two solutions for @xmath17 .",
    "if the right hand side is 3 or more , then @xmath17 must be equal to it .",
    "if the right hand side is negative , then @xmath17 must be 3 less than it .",
    "and if the right hand side is 0 , 1 , or 2 , then @xmath17 can _ either _ be equal to it _ or _ be 3 less than it  we are free to choose .",
    "the reversed rule is non - deterministic , but it can always find a compatible value .",
    "in other words , there is no `` garden of eden '' pattern for this rule , if we assume that all integers are permissible states .",
    "the top row of figure  [ fig : selforg ] shows the palace number patterns for games 100 and 1000 .",
    "the patterns are strikingly similar , given that the value of @xmath1 differs by an order of magnitude .",
    "the pattern for game 1000 has the appearance of being `` the same , but ten times bigger '' than the pattern for game 100 .",
    "the middle and lower rows of figure  [ fig : selforg ] zoom in on subregions where the two patterns are in fact identical , without any scaling factor .      as an aid to our discussion of these complex images",
    ", we will give names to the prominent features in them .",
    "we can see that this system self - organizes itself into 11 regions with 14 borders and 6 junctions . ignoring duplicates due to the mirror symmetry , there are 7 regions , 7 borders , and 4 junction points",
    ".    we will start by naming the 7 regions and some features inside them .",
    "the region at the upper left ( the game s terminal region , and the ca s starting region ) , in the shape of a dented triangle , is the _",
    "the triangular regions adjacent to the hood , with a periodic interior ( visible in all panels of figure  [ fig : selforg ] ) , are the _ paulettes_.",
    "the rhomboid region that emanates from between the pair of paulettes is the _",
    "fabric_. the solid black regions at the top and at the left constitute the _",
    "outer space_. between the outer space and the paulettes we find the _ arms _",
    "( irregular yellow regions in figure  [ fig : selforg ] ) , which extend indefinitely . extending next to the arms , and of similar width",
    ", we have the _",
    "warps_. each warp contains a number of _ threads _",
    "( strings of yellow dots , clearly visible in the top left panel of figure  [ fig : prefix ] ) which come out of the fabric . between the warps",
    "lies the _ inner sector _",
    ", and the blue stripes in the warps and in the inner sector are the _",
    "weft_.    next , we will name the 4 junction points .",
    "the hood , paulettes , and fabric all meet at the _",
    "nose_. the hood , paulette , arm , and outer space all meet at the _ shoulder_.",
    "the warp , fabric , paulette , and arm all meet at the _ armpit _ , which is often a hotspot of highly positive palace numbers . and the fabric , warps , and inner sector meet at the _",
    "prism_. the inner sector often contains slightly higher palace numbers than the warps , especially near the main diagonal , giving the impression of light being emitted from the prism , as in figure  [ fig : laser ] .",
    "finally , we come to the 7 borders .",
    "the hood and paulette meet cleanly at the _",
    "casing_. the hood contains all the states from @xmath53 to @xmath54 , but after the casing , the ca uses very few states .",
    "the paulette and arm meet at the _",
    "the paulette and fabric meet at the _ rift _ , a narrow , relatively empty space which appears to get wider very slowly .",
    "the fabric and warp meet at the _ fray _ , where threads almost parallel to the fray unravel from the fabric , and threads in the other direction exit the fabric and start merging to form thick threads in the warp . there is no clear boundary where the warp meets the inner sector , since the warp simply runs out of threads .",
    "the warp also meets the arm cleanly , at the inside of the arm . at the boundary between the warp and the arm",
    ", it appears that the yellow nature of the arm is due to being packed full of threads , and the warp simply has a much lower density of threads .",
    "threads that bend into the inner sector , and stop being parallel to the rest of the warp , are sometimes called _ beams _ ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the often - occurring slightly - separated periodic part of the arm , bordering the outer space , is the _",
    "skin_.    the fray , warp , central sector , armpits , and prism are all very sensitive to @xmath1 , but all the other regions are not , with the exception of the fabric and the rift , which are sensitive only to @xmath55 .",
    "the fabric , fray , warp , prism , and central sector are all full of weft .",
    "often the centermost beams will communicate with each other via the weft , and this process can usually be analyzed to calculate the slopes of these beams , which are generally quadratic irrationals .",
    "this is the greatest complexity of self - organization that we have seen for a system that has no structured input .",
    "the hood and the paulets have a very regular structure .",
    "the palace numbers in the hood increase steadily in each row and column , increasing by one when the higher coordinate is incremented , and by two when the lower coordinate is incremented .",
    "thus the hood contains all palace numbers from 0 , at the upper left corner , to @xmath1 , where the hood meets the paulettes at the casing , a line with slope -1/2 ( and -2 ) that connects the nose at @xmath56 to the shoulder at @xmath57 ( and @xmath58 ) .",
    "the hood is exactly the region where every move is a winning move , because all possible further moves can be blocked , thereby immediately winning the game .",
    "when players are not making mistakes , the game ends when ( and only when ) somebody moves into the hood , thereby winning the game .",
    "the palace numbers in the paulettes form a two - dimensional periodic pattern , with periods @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( and all integral linear combinations of those base periods ) .",
    "only the palace numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath61 appear in the paulettes . in the paulette s periodic region of size 11 , @xmath0 ( a p - position ) appears 5 times , and @xmath1 and @xmath61 ( both n - positions ( _ no palace _ ) ) each appear 3 times .",
    "the arms , shown in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : selforg ] have a random appearance , although they often contain temporary black stripes at one of the two angles parallel to their sides . despite this initial appearance of disorder ,",
    "the arms have many interesting properties , discussed in section  [ sec : arms ] .",
    "the fabric exhibits further self - organization .",
    "the larger black regions visible in the middle row of figure  [ fig : selforg ] form a rough grid , and in much larger pictures ( @xmath62 ) the grid morphs into a larger - scale grid , which is at a slightly different angle and has cells about 3.5 times larger .",
    "regions of the small - grid pattern appear to travel through the large grid like meta - gliders , visible in the top right of figure  [ fig : gliders ] .",
    "these grid cells are separated by threads of p - positions , which are able to split and merge to form smaller and larger threads , and sometimes seem to disappear .    threads typically have a measurable ( vertical , horizontal , and/or diagonal ) thickness , which is added when they merge , as happens frequently just after the fray , as in figure  [ fig : fray ] .",
    "for example , in the left - hand warp the threads have integer vertical thicknesses , that is , each thread has a fixed number of p - positions that occur in every column . furthermore",
    ", this fixed number is always a fibonacci number .      if we look around the nose , we see one of three pictures , depending on the value of @xmath55 , because this determines the precise pixel arrangement of the casing at the nose .",
    "these three shapes are shown in figure  [ fig : rhomb ] .",
    "since there are only three possibilities for the hood boundary shape at the nose , and the ca rule can then be used to produce the paulettes and fabric without knowing @xmath1 , we see that despite the chaotic nature of the fabric , there are in fact only three fabric patterns that can be produced . figures  [ fig : selforg ] and  [ fig : rhombwhite ] both show examples of how the full fabric area matches between different games with @xmath1 congruent modulo 3 .",
    "using the ca , starting from an infinite casing pattern , we can make any of the three fabric patterns in an infinitely large version .",
    "the fabric patterns that we see in practice are simply prefixes of one of these three infinite fabrics .",
    "the arms similarly can be formed by the ca rule from the shoulder , and in this case there is only one possible pattern . figure  [ fig : armwhite ] shows how this pattern remains very stable as @xmath1 increases .",
    "where the arm borders the outer space , the arm grows a periodic skin ( see figure  [ fig : skinpattern ] ) , which is slightly separated from the rest of the arm , except that it emits a vertical ( in the case of the upper arm ) line once per period .",
    "this skin consists of solidly packed p - positions , with a vertical thickness of @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 where a line is emitted ) , a diagonal thickness of @xmath65 , a horizontal thickness of @xmath66 , a horizontal period of @xmath67 , and a vertical period of @xmath65 , where @xmath63 is the @xmath68 fibonacci number .",
    "the skin originally forms at the top of the arm with @xmath69 , and after about 200 pixels ( horizontally , about 80 vertically ) it changes to the form with @xmath70 , then after about 7700 pixels it changes to the form with @xmath71 .",
    "we conjecture that for large @xmath1 , it will continue to thicken in this manner , with @xmath13 increasing by one each time , approaching a slope of @xmath72 . in the other direction",
    ", one can even see the @xmath73 stage of this pattern as part of the paulette at the start of the arm for the first 10 pixels or so , although it is not clearly visible due to the lack of black pixels between this skin and the rest of the arm .    the boundary between the skin ( which has palace numbers @xmath74 and @xmath0 ) and the outer space ( which has constant palace number @xmath1 ) consists of steps of width 2 or 3 .",
    "each time the skin thickens , the pattern of steps expands according to the rule @xmath75 , starting from the pattern of just @xmath76 for the skin @xmath73 .",
    "the skin pattern of positions of palace numbers @xmath74 and @xmath0 can be computed from this pattern of steps and from the assumption that there are @xmath77 palaces to the left of the skin in each row .",
    "this pattern is rotationally symmetric within each period ( between the columns that produce the vertical lines ) , and with each thickening follows the expansion rule ( writing @xmath33 for @xmath74 , etc . )",
    "@xmath78 @xmath79 where one of the four expansion matrices is chosen based on the required size .",
    "the widths are determined by the step pattern , and the heights are partially defined by the property that all matrices produced by a given row should have a row in common .",
    "most of the observations in section  [ sec : selforg ] may be viewed as open problems . here",
    "we list of a few .",
    "* is it the case that a sufficiently thick arm will grow thicker and thicker skin over time ? * the arm s skin ( as observed for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) has a vertical thickness of @xmath63 ( except where a line is emitted ) , a diagonal thickness of @xmath65 , a horizontal thickness of @xmath66 , a horizontal period of @xmath67 , and a vertical period of @xmath65 , where @xmath13 is the thickness level ( here @xmath80 is the @xmath81 fibonacci number ) .",
    "can this pattern be explained , and does it continue ? * are the inner sectors beyond the fabric essentially different for different  @xmath1 , starting with distinct armpits ( see figure  [ fig : gliders ] ) , and eventually producing ever different and irregular innermost p - threads",
    "? * are the armpits the unique regions from which the queen views the most palaces ( for large @xmath1 ) ? *",
    "do the innermost p - threads always have slopes corresponding to algebraic numbers ? if there is only one innermost upper p - thread ,",
    "is the slope a root of a second degree polynomial with rational coefficients ?",
    "* how many non - periodic threads can there be for a given @xmath1 ?",
    "we conjecture at most two upper ones ( as occurs for @xmath82 ) , which must be the inner ones ; with all others eventually becoming periodic . *",

    "<S> the game , known as _ blocking wythoff nim _ , consists of moving a queen as in chess , but always towards  ( 0,0 ) , and it may not be moved to any of @xmath0 temporarily `` blocked '' positions specified on the previous turn by the other player . </S>",
    "<S> the game ends when a player wins by blocking all possible moves of the other player . </S>",
