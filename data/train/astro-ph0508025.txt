    "one of the most dramatic effects of vigorous star formation ( sf ) is the creation of holes and shells in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "it is commonly proposed that these structures are caused by feedback from massive stars ( stellar winds and type ii sne ; e.g. , tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) , though alternative scenarios do exist ( high velocity cloud impacts , disk instabilities , turbulence , ram pressure stripping ; e.g. , s ' anchez - salcedo 2002 ) .",
    "starburst regions and sites of massive cluster formation provide spatially and temporally concentrated feedback that can create the largest of these structures . holes and shells are therefore a direct , observable signature of the deposit of energy from stars into the ism .",
    "these structures are found in a great variety of environments , from the milky way disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the ism of dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after being formed by the combined effects of sne and stellar winds , the evolution of holes and shells will have a strong environmental dependence ; in normal spiral disks , these structures are erased by turbulent motions and rotational shear on time scales of @xmath1 10@xmath2 yr .",
    "on the other hand , in dwarf galaxies ( typically displaying solid - body rotation ) , rotational shear will not play a major role , and holes and shells may remain coherent until pressure equilibrium is re - established with the local ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "indeed , studies of active , nearby dwarf galaxies show that these systems are permeated with holes and shells to the h  i  resolution limit [ e.g. , the large magellanic cloud ( kim etal .",
    "1999 ) ; the small magellanic cloud ( stanimirovic etal .",
    "1999 ) ; and ic10 ( wilcots & miller 1998 ) , to name just a few ] .",
    "ic2574 is a comparatively large ( optical disk @xmath1 18 kpc diameter ) , relatively low - metallicity [ 12@xmath3log(o / h ) @xmath4 8.15 , or @xmath1",
    "30% z@xmath5 ; miller & hodge 1996 ] dwarf galaxy in the m81 group that is undergoing active current sf ( h@xmath0-derived sfr @xmath4 0.09 m@xmath5yr@xmath6 ; miller & hodge 1994 , kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "the galaxy hosts a multitude of h  i   holes and shells @xcite , which at the distance of 4.0 mpc @xcite provide a unique opportunity to study the process of sf and to observe its effects on the surrounding ism .",

    "for an overview of the _ spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey _ ( _ sings _ ) observational strategies , see @xcite .",
    "ic2574 was observed for 71 minutes in irac mosaicing mode on 28 and 29 october , 2004 ; mips scan mapping mode observations were obtained on 1 , 3 november , 2004 , for a total of 127.6 minutes .",
    "all data were processed by the _ sings _  pipelines .",
    "the irac pipeline processes basic calibrated data images ; flux levels are uncertain at the @xmath1 10% level .",
    "the mips instrument team data analysis tool @xcite was used to process the mips data .",
    "systematic uncertainties ( e.g. , detector nonlinearities , time - dependent responsivity variations , background removal , etc . ) limit the absolute flux calibration to @xmath1 10% at 24 @xmath10 m  and to @xmath1 20% at 70 and 160 @xmath10 m . fluxes were measured after convolution to the ( 38  fwhm ) 160@xmath10 m  mips beam , using kernels derived from observations of a bright star ( irac ) or from stinytim models , smoothed to match the observed psfs ( assuming a 25 k black body , suitable for the dust temperatures derived ; mips ) .",
    "the sgs region provides the bulk ( @xmath4 50% at 24 and 70 @xmath10 m ) of the total ir ( tir ) luminosity of ic2574 at wavelengths longer than @xmath1 5 @xmath10 m . in figure  [ figcap1 ]",
    "we present a comparison of the total galaxy emission in the optical v band , the mips 70 @xmath10 m  band , and the h  i  spectral line .",
    "note in figure  [ figcap1](c ) that ic2574 contains numerous h  i  shells ( walter & brinks 1999 identify 48 holes and shells in the ism ; the sgs studied here corresponds to # 35 from that study ) .    in figure  [ figcap2 ]",
    "we present images of the sgs region at nine different wavelengths .",
    "note from the optical ( v - band ; figure  [ figcap2]a ) and near - ir ( irac 3.6 @xmath10 m ; figure  [ figcap2]b ) images that the progenitor stellar cluster lies directly interior to the h  i  shell ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this is one of the clearest examples of a kinematically distinct gaseous shell with the parent cluster still visible . by 8 @xmath10m(see figure  [ figcap2]c )",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the cluster has fallen below the detection limit , and emission from hot dust and gas dominates ; variations in emission in the mips bands ( figures  [ figcap2]d , e , f ) indicate a wide variety of dust temperatures and spectral energy distributions . note that the shell morphology is still evident at 70 and 160 @xmath10 m ; the diffuse emission in the shell is most likely caused by the mips psf profiles , which spread flux from high surface brightness regions onto arcminute scales ( i.e. , a few times the mips 160 @xmath10 m  psf fwhm ) .",
    "comparison of the mips , h@xmath0  and radio continuum images [ figures  [ figcap2](g , h ) ] shows a wide variation in the relative ratios .",
    "finally , the h  i  distribution [ figure  [ figcap2](i ) ] shows the h  i  shell very clearly ; it is expanding into a non - uniform medium that may partially explain the variety of dust properties around the shell rim .",
    "flux densities were extracted in the apertures shown in figure  [ figcap2 ] ( see table  [ t1 ] ) ; these regions were selected to encompass the mid - ir , far - ir , h@xmath0 , and h  i  emission peaks with the minimum number of apertures and amount of overlap ( note that some apertures contain distinct emission properties at different wavelengths ; e.g. , sgs1 shows a pronounced difference in h@xmath0  and radio continuum morphologies ) .",
    "the size of these apertures corresponds to the fwhm ( 38  @xmath11 740 pc ) of the mips 160 @xmath10 m   beam .",
    "aperture correction factors have not been applied to the values shown in table  [ t1 ] ; the extent of the apertures for all wavelengths up to the mips 70 @xmath10 m  band ( sampling more than 2 , 6 , 16 , and 36 times the fwhm at mips 70 @xmath10 m , mips 24 @xmath10 m , irac 8 @xmath10 m , and irac 3.6 @xmath10 m , respectively ) should imply relatively small aperture correction effects at these wavelengths .",
    "there will be some aperture effects at mips 160 @xmath10 m  and potentially at 70 @xmath10 m  as well , though the quantification of these factors depends on many parameters ( including the distribution of light within the aperture , location and brightness of neighboring sources , and many others ) .",
    "the characteristics of the dust change dramatically between apertures .",
    "there are appreciable variations in the dust temperature ; _ f_@xmath12(70@xmath10m)/_f_@xmath12(160@xmath10",
    "m ) varies by a factor of @xmath1 3 , with the warmest dust in regions sgs3 and sgs5 .",
    "fitting blackbody functions modified by a @xmath13 emissivity to the 70 and 160 @xmath10 m mips images ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these fluctuations correspond to a temperature range of @xmath1 23 - 29 k ( averaged over each aperture ; see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "note that the warmest dust is found in regions that have the highest h@xmath0  flux ; the coolest dust is found in region sgs2 , which is at the largest distance from the sgs itself , and also shows the lowest h@xmath0  flux .",
    "interestingly , region sgs4 , which shows the highest flux density in all _ spitzer _  bands , does not show the highest h@xmath0  flux .    comparing the far - ir , h@xmath0 , and h  i  morphologies",
    ", it is evident that all regions except sgs3 occupy areas with high h  i  surface brightness ( h  i   column densities 0.3ex-0.75em0.65ex  2@xmath710@xmath14 @xmath15 ) .",

    "however , this simple scenario can become complicated in different environments , with dependencies on stellar populations , dust content , etc .",
    "( see kennicutt 1998 for a more detailed discussion ) . in the case of ( typically low - metallicity ) dwarf star - forming galaxies such as ic2574 , the correlation between various sfr indicators may be especially complicated , given their low dust contents and ir luminosities .",
    "dust extinction effects ( in both an absolute and differential sense ) on the h@xmath0  fluxes in the sgs are minimal , based on two independent lines of evidence : first , the uv imaging study of this region by @xcite shows typical line - of - sight reddening values in the wavelength range around h@xmath0  of a@xmath19 0.15 mag , with a maximum of @xmath1 0.3 mag ; second , new _",

    "we find that the l(h@xmath0)/l(tir ) ratio is systematically higher ( by factors of @xmath1 10 ; see table  [ t1 ] ) in regions that are bright in h@xmath0   compared to more quiescent regions . if one were to naively convert the h@xmath0  and ir fluxes to sfrs [ using the relations of kennicutt ( 1998 ) and dale & helou ( 2002 ) ] , the sfr(h@xmath0 ) values would be systematically higher ( by factors of @xmath1 10 ) than those derived from the total ir luminosity in the active regions .",
    "since the @xcite fir calibration assumes complete absorption of the starlight , this factor - of - ten difference implies a typical h@xmath0 extinction in these regions of about 10% ( a(h@xmath0 ) @xmath1 0.1 mag ) . this is roughly consistent with the range of values cited above , and suggests caution in the application of sfr relations based on total ir luminosities in low - metallicity environments .",
    "note that the variations in the l(h@xmath0)/l(tir ) ratio are not due only to varying spatial resolutions between h@xmath0  and 160 @xmath10 m ; we tested the severity of this effect by convolving the h@xmath0  image to the 160 @xmath10 m  resolution , and find that the l(h@xmath0)/l(tir ) ratio still varies by factors of @xmath1 5 within the sgs region ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .      assuming that the total ir fluxes ( derived by applying equation 4 from dale & helou 2002 ) and the radio continuum emission are related via a constant value [ q @xmath21 log(s@xmath22/s@xmath23 ) ; see , e.g. , bell ( 2003 ) for details ] , we derive strong variations in the value of q(tir / radio ) throughout the sgs region ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the mean value of `` q '' derived within the sgs region ( @xmath4 3.0 ) is consistent with , though slightly larger than , the average global values found in a sample of larger spiral galaxies in the _ sings _  sample @xcite ; we find variations of @xmath4 1 dex in the value of `` q '' throughout the sgs region",
    ". these strong variations may be a result of the low dust content in ic2574 ( an effect of the low metal content , or of dust destruction in the extreme sgs environment ) .",
