    "compton - thick agn ( ctagn ) are expected to constitute a significant fraction of the overall agn population in the local universe , accounting for @xmath02030@xmath10 of agn according to multiwavelength studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "many studies also predict that ctagn provide a substantial contribution to the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , responsible for 1025@xmath10 of the flux at the peak energy , @xmath0 30 kev ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . yet , their census is still far from complete . the high line - of - sight column density in ctagn ( @xmath2 @xmath11 1/@xmath12 @xmath13 1.5 @xmath3",
    "10@xmath4 @xmath5 , where @xmath12 is the thomson scattering constant ) , generally attributed to the parsec - scale circumnuclear torus of agn unification schemes , as well as larger - scale molecular clouds and dust lanes , results in severe attenuation of the direct x - ray emission from ctagn at energies below 10 kev .",
    "this is why observations at higher energies are needed to probe this direct component and provide unambiguous identification of ctagn .",
    "however , even at @xmath9 @xmath14 10 kev , the remaining flux that we observe in the most extreme ctagn will be from photons scattered or reflected from the back - side of the torus , and will comprise just a few percent of the intrinsic agn power ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this makes the identification and characterization of ctagn a challenging task .    to date ,",
    "only @xmath020 agn within @xmath15 200 mpc have been confirmed as ct based upon detailed x - ray spectral characterization ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to a fraction of @xmath16 1@xmath10 of the _ total _ agn population expected within that volume , suggesting that the vast majority of ctagn are yet to be found even in the local universe .",
    "these _ bona - fide _ ctagn were unambiguously identified based upon a detection at energies above 10 kev and the presence of a fe k@xmath17 line at 6.4 kev with high equivalent width , ew @xmath1 1 kev .",
    "the identification and characterization of all the ctagn is important in order to form an accurate census of accretion in the local universe , since much of the growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur in such heavily obscured phases ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , an accurate local benchmark is important for extrapolating the results to higher redshifts .",
    "we have started a program to study a complete , volume - limited ( @xmath18 @xmath19 15 mpc ) , mid - infrared ( mir ) selected agn sample from @xcite , with the main goal of constraining the population of ctagn and the @xmath2 distribution of agn in the local universe .",
    "ctagn candidates from the sample were identified using multiwavelength selections , such as x - ray spectroscopy , and intrinsic 210 kev luminosity indicators from high spatial resolution mir 12@xmath20 m continuum and [ o]@xmath215007  line luminosity corrected for the balmer decrement .",
    "one of the candidates that stands out in the sample as being ct based on these analyses is ngc 5643 .",
    "ngc 5643 is a nearby face - on ( _ i _",
    "@xmath15 30@xmath22 ) sab(rs)c galaxy hosting a low - luminosity seyfert 2 nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has a redshift of @xmath23 @xmath13 0.0040 , corresponding to a metric / proper distance of @xmath18 @xmath13 13.9 mpc under the assumption of the @xcite cosmic attractor model @xcite .",
    "ngc 5643 features a compact radio core with two - sided , kiloparsec - scale lobes in an east - west orientation @xcite , and a cospatial one - sided h@xmath17 and [ o ] emission line region extending east - ward of the nucleus for at least 1.8 kpc @xcite . despite the intense star formation episodes occuring in the spiral arm , mir diagnostics suggest that the agn still dominates the overall ir ( 81000@xmath20 m ) energy budget @xcite",
    ". comparisons of optical spectra with synthesis models , however , are consistent with a  starburst / seyfert 2 composite \" spectrum @xcite . using br@xmath24 emission , @xcite found no on - going star formation activity in the nucleus , although the possibility of a recent ( terminated ) starburst can not be excluded .",
    "this source also shows spatially resolved molecular gas flowing out from the agn at a rate of 10 m@xmath25 yr@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although water maser emission associated with the agn has been detected in ngc 5643 , a corresponding spatially resolved map , which would allow for a direct measurement of the supermassive black hole mass ( _ _ m__@xmath26 ) , is not yet available @xcite .",

    "dramatic spectral changes were observed between the _ xmm - newton _ observation carried out in 2003 , and the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations performed earlier .",
    "however , the point spread function ( psf ) of _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ were not sufficient to separate the emission of the nucleus from that of a nearby x - ray source ( at an angular separation of @xmath050@xmath29 ) , ngc 5643 x1 , which was found to be very bright at the time of the _ xmm - newton _ observation ( g04 ) .",
    "therefore , it remained unclear which source was responsible for the spectral variability observed .",
    "comparisons of the _ xmm - newton _ observations in 2003 and 2009 showed that there is no significant variation in the spectrum of the agn ( @xcite ; hereafter m13 ) .",
    "however , the off - nuclear source was found to be more than a factor of two fainter in flux in 2009 ( m13 ) than in 2003 ( g04 ) .",
    "the _ chandra _ image of the agn shows that the soft x - ray emission ( @xmath9 @xmath30 2 kev ) of the nucleus is spatially correlated with the [ o ] emission @xcite , consistent with what is commonly observed for many seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the dominant power source of this soft x - ray emission appears to be photoionization from the agn , although it is still unclear how much collisional ionization contributes to the overall x - ray emission ( m13 ) . above 2 kev ,",
    "the x - ray spectra from these various observations show indications of the nucleus being absorbed by ct material .",
    "the evidence for this are the detection of a prominent fe k@xmath17 line ( ew @xmath14 1 kev ) and a flat photon index below 10 kev ( @xmath31 1 ) , which are characteristics of a reflection - dominated spectrum .",
    "analysis of the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) _ bepposax _ spectrum where ngc 5643 was detected only up to 10 kev , combined with an upper limit for the 15100 kev band , suggested a tentative lower limit to the column density of @xmath2 @xmath14 10@xmath32 @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the true nature of the off - nuclear x - ray source , ngc 5643 x1 , is still uncertain .",
    "it is located in the outskirts of the host galaxy optical emission and identification of counterparts at other wavelengths has been ambiguous ( g04 ) .",

    ", much evidence for the presence of distant cold reflecting regions have been found in nearby ctagn ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to accurately characterize the broadband spectra of these agn",
    ", multiple reflector components are required to model each of these reflecting regions .",
    "we investigated whether this could be the case for ngc 5643 by looking at the _ chandra _ image of the agn in the 67.5 kev band ( @xmath030 counts ) .",
    "this is shown in the top left panel of figure 5 . at first glance , the image appears to show that the iron emission region is extended well beyond the parsec - scale torus , suggesting the presence of distant cold reflecting regions .",
    "however , this appearance could also be due to an elongated psf as a result of the position of the target on the detector , as well as the energy range used to produce the source image .",
    "we therefore used the marx simulator ( v4.4 ) to produce the expected psf with a much higher count than the source counts ( @xmath0 100 000 counts ) at the position of the agn , and at the mean energy range that we are interested in ( @xmath9 @xmath13 6.75 kev ) .",
    "this is shown in the top right panel of figure 5 .",
    "we then plotted 1d radial profiles of the target and the simulated psf along the semi - major axis of the simulated psf determined using the tool within , and performed a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test between the two distributions ( bottom panel of figure 5 ) .",
    "we found that the ks test probability is @xmath136 @xmath13 0.983 , indicating that the iron emission region of the target is consistent with the simulated psf , and therefore is not extended ( see similar finding for ngc 3393 in @xcite ) .",
    "a deeper ( scheduled ) _ chandra _ observation could help to confirm this .    the ctagn in ngc 5643 is located in a face - on grand design spiral galaxy with an undisturbed disk ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the emission lines from the agn are not obscured / extinguished by the host galaxy material @xcite , indicating that any phenomenon that might contribute to the ct obscuration in this source is therefore likely to occur very close to the nucleus .",
    "indeed , there have been indications that the emission at the west side of the nucleus is obscured by a warped disk or the presence of a dust lane ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the torus itself could be the inner structure of this disk .",
    "because of the more direct and `` cleaner '' view of the central engine in ngc 5643 as compared to some other very nearby bona - fide ctagn such as ngc 1068 , ngc 4945 and circinus , this makes ngc 5643 a good candidate for more detailed studies of the ct obscurer in the nuclear region .",
    "we observed the agn and ulx candidate in ngc 5643 using _",
