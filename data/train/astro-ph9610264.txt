    "in order to improve our knowledge of the distribution and amount of luminous and dark matter ( dm ) in spiral galaxies , one has to construct mass models to reproduce the observed rotation curves ( rcs ) in detail ( e.g. see review by van albada in this volume ) .",
    "this can only be done by using extended rcs which sample the matter distribution far beyond the stellar disk .",
    "a troubling feature of these models is , however , the unknown scaling of the light distribution to a mass distribution in the form of a free @xmath2 ratio .",
    "this uncertainty limits us to determining only the relative contributions of disk , bulge and dark components to the gravitational potential by making certain assumptions for the @xmath2 ratios of the luminous components .",
    "the most widely used alternative is to maximize the contributions of these components to the observed rc ( `` maximum disk hypothesis '' ) .",
    "one of the arguments for using a maximum disk is that optical rcs are very well reproduced by a combination of luminous components only .",
    "new data for the milky way also seem to be in agreement with a maximum disk solution with an @xmath2 typical for sb  sc galaxies @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the distribution of disk @xmath2 ratios obtained from optical rcs ( without the use of a dm component ) , and try to determine the width of the intrinsic ( i.e. `` scale''-free ) @xmath2 distribution .",
    "we have used data from the large collection of deep @xmath0-band photometry and h@xmath1 rcs of sb and sc galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the sample was originally selected for tully - fisher mapping of peculiar velocities in the northern hemisphere .",
    "it includes sb  sc galaxies from the ugc catalog with inclinations between @xmath3 , which makes this sample well suited for mass modeling studies . from",
    "the original published collection of 350 spirals , we selected 290 galaxies with data of suitable quality to fit mass models to the optical rcs .",
    "the available data base is briefly described below ; more detailed information about the photometric and spectroscopic observations can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    the one - dimensional @xmath0-band surface brightness ( sb ) profiles",
    "were obtained with 1m - class telescopes at lick , palomar , and kitt peak observatories .",
    "repeat observations taken for almost half of the total observed sample and comparisons with the @xmath0-band photometry of @xcite and @xcite both indicate that the photometry is reliable down to 26 @xmath0-@xmath4 and that the total @xmath0-band magnitudes are accurate to @xmath5 .",
    "spectroscopic observations were made with the uv schmidt spectrograph at the lick 3 m telescope .",
    "exposure times were typically 1800s which yields a sampling of the h@xmath1 rcs out to about one optical radius ( @xmath6 , defined at the 24 @xmath0-@xmath4 isophotal level ) .",
    "for the purpose of mass modeling , the observed rcs were folded and averaged about their centers .",
    "after inspection of each rotation curve , a transition radius was determined just beyond the central solid - body rise .",
    "the averaged , folded rcs were then re - sampled at intervals of 2  ( average seeing of all observations ) within the transition radius ; beyond that , the bins were doubled in size to improve the s / n in the fainter regions of the disk .",
    "line - of - sight velocities were deprojected using disk inclinations determined from the photometry . a correction for redshift broadening",
    "was also applied .",
    "seventy - six galaxies were observed more than once and their folded rcs were combined by taking the weighted average velocity within each bin .",
    "we also retrieved iras @xmath7 fluxes @xmath8 for 189 sample galaxies from the iras faint source catalog through ned ( nasa / ipac extragalactic database ) .",
    "these provide an estimate of the star formation rate and will be used in our discussion in   [ sec_ml ] the conversion from observed ( ) to physical ( kpc ) units uses heliocentric redshifts and h@xmath9 .",
    "it has become clear that one must derive bulge and disk parameters simultaneously in order to obtain reliable decompositions @xcite .",
    "the method we adopt is to fit model functions to the bulge and disk profiles ( in the magnitude regime ) using a non - linear @xmath10 minimalization routine .",
    "the sum of disk and bulge model functions were convolved with a gaussian - shaped psf ( with the appropriate seeing fwhm ) before it was fitted to the observed profile .    a fundamental aspect of the decompositions is the choice of fitting functions .",
    "while the exponential nature of disk profiles has clearly been established @xcite , the true shape of bulge profiles in late - type spirals appears to have eluded the majority of workers in the field .",
    "data now suggest that late - type bulges would be more accurately represented by an exponential profile instead of the long - assumed de  vaucouleurs law .",
    "historical developments are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .    to test for the shape of bulge luminosity profiles , we adopt the formulation of @xcite who showed that exponential and de vaucouleurs profiles are special cases of the general power law : @xmath11 \\ ; , \\label{eq_sersic1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the central brightness",
    ", @xmath13 is a scaling radius , and the exponent @xmath14 is a free variable .",
    "@xmath15 corresponds to an exponential profile and the @xmath16 case is equivalent to a de  vaucouleurs law .      because many sb profiles often show unevenness ( bumps and wiggles )",
    ", it is not always possible to determine the best value of @xmath17 reliably for most galaxies in our sample .",
    "these irregularities are often explained by the presence of regions of enhanced star formation , spiral arms , bars or other asymmetries in the 2-d light distribution .",
    "a significant fraction of sb profiles are of freeman type ii , defined by @xcite as a profile with a dip ( near the bulge / disk transition ) with respect to the exponential fit from the outer disk .",
    "indeed , our sample is about equally divided between freeman types i and ii . in order to establish the best fitting bulge function for the late - type systems , we first selected galaxies with smooth freeman type i sb profiles and with a noticeable central ( bulge - like ) component .",
    "a total of 63 galaxies were selected for a combination of 90 independently - determined sb profiles .",
    "even with this `` cleaner '' sub - sample , solving for all five parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath17 ) simultaneously would be fraught with danger . due to the paucity of data points at the center , the simultaneous solution of three bulge parameters is poorly constrained at best .",
    "instead , we solve for a range of _ fixed _ values of @xmath17 with the other four parameters unconstrained .",
    "an acceptable solution was usually reached within 10 or fewer iterations .",
    "the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_sub_sb_rc ] show examples of bulge + disk decompositions with values of @xmath22 for ugc  9097 , a strong - bulged spiral by late - type standards .",
    "the quality of the match is usually best judged in the transition region between the bulge and inner disk .",
    "the failure of the @xmath23 profile is quite noticeable .",
    "indeed , for nearly all the sb profiles , exponential bulges yield the lowest @xmath10 values .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_sub_n_chi]a which shows the distribution of @xmath10 s for @xmath24 ( squares ) and 4 ( crosses ) against the one for exponential bulges .",
    "we sampled values of @xmath17 between 0.2 and 6 in steps of 0.2 , and determined for each profile the `` best '' value of @xmath17 corresponding to the lowest @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of `` best '' @xmath17 values , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_sub_n_chi]b , peaks at a value of @xmath25 , i.e. nearly exponential profiles .",
    "the ratio of bulge - to - disk exponential scale lengths ( not shown here ) is close to 0.1 , as predicted by n - body simulations of secular evolution models ( courteau 1996 , courteau 1996b ) . in agreement with other recent studies ( see e.g. courteau 1996 , and references therein ) , we conclude from this that the central regions of late - type spirals are best fit by exponential profiles , rather than the de vaucouleurs law or an @xmath26 bulge . for the remainder of this paper , sb profiles",
    "will only be modeled as a combination of two exponentials for the bulge and disk respectively .",
    "modeling of the observed rotation curves follows the non - linear least - squares procedure outlined by @xcite and @xcite ( see also review by van albada in this volume ) .",
    "the basic assumption is that the gravitational potential of a galaxy can be described as the sum of potentials of individual mass components , like stellar bulge and disk , gas disk , dark halo , etc . in all cases ,",
    "the radial distribution of visible mass is assumed to be given by the mean radial distribution of light obtained from the b / d decompositions of the sb profiles .",
    "the bulge and disk @xmath2 s are allowed to vary independently but remain constant ( as a function of radius ) within each component .",
    "the observed rcs are well fitted by the luminous components alone .",
    "these data provide little support for a dark component , and therefore its contribution has not been included in the mass models .",
    "this also means that the @xmath2 s derived in this way are true `` maximum '' disk ( and bulge ) values , since inclusion of gas and dark matter will only lower these values .",
    "the model disk and bulge rotation velocities are sampled at the same radii as the observed rotation curve , added in quadrature using the @xmath2 s as free scaling parameters , and fitted to the observed rotation curve .",
    "all fits were visually inspected and occasionally the bulge contribution was adjusted manually ( @xmath27 set to maximum allowed value ) , especially in cases where the number of data points in the central region was insufficient to constrain the fits .",
    "we shall now examine the variation of @xmath2 ( from here onwards , @xmath2 will refer to _ disk _",
    "@xmath2 ) among galaxies and try to understand the processes causing this variation . fig .",
    "[ fig_mlhist]a shows the distribution of the `` raw '' @xmath2 from the mass decomposition of the rotation curves .",
    "the @xmath0-band luminosities used to estimate @xmath2 were corrected for galactic extinction only , but these ( and consequently the @xmath2 s ) need to be corrected for internal extinction as well . unfortunately , there is no trivial and accepted way to do this due to our very limited understanding of radiation transfer and sources of opacity in galaxies ( e.g. see conf .",
    "proc . on this subject ,",
    "the inclination dependence of @xmath2 s was removed empirically by fitting the observed trend against ellipticities .",
    "figure  [ fig_mlhist]b shows the dependence of the `` raw '' @xmath2 s on ellipticity ; the line indicates the fit used to correct to `` face - on '' ratios .",
    "application of this correction reduces the width of the @xmath2 distribution by 17% ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_mlhist]c , d )",
    ". the corrected values still show a fairly broad distribution given the narrow range of galaxy types ( sb  sc ) .",
    "one can appreciate that the mass in these @xmath2 s is dominated by the old disk population , whereas a larger population of stars contributes to the @xmath0-band galaxian flux .",
    "indeed , @xcite recently argued that a large part of the @xmath2 scatter is due to variations in star formation rates ( sfrs ) among galaxies .",
    "these authors used @xmath28 as an indicator of the present sfr per unit mass ( their @xmath29 comes from a maximum - disk fit analogous to ours ) , to expose a clear correlation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 using the rubin / kent sample @xcite .",
    "galaxies with a prominent young population have low @xmath2 s which , they infer , would be due to enhanced star formation .",
    "this trend is also visible in our sample as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ml_l60]a .",
    "however the lack of correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath32 ( a more direct indicator of the sfr ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ml_l60]b suggests that the above effect is most likely due to a correlation between @xmath2 and the mass of the stellar disk , contrary to the interpretation of @xcite .",
    "it is not clear if the mass of the stellar disk itself is the fundamental physical parameter , but one could argue that the _",
    "`` size '' _ of the galaxy is an important scaling parameter .",
    "the `` size '' of a galaxy could be measured by its ( disk ) mass , luminosity , linear size or disk scale length ( @xmath33 ) since these parameters are all tightly coupled via the tully - fisher relation .",
    "the dependence of @xmath2 s on the scaling parameter @xmath33 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mlhist]f .",
    "compact galaxies have low @xmath2 s and big galaxies have large @xmath2 s . if we take out this scaling effect using the fitted line in fig .",
    "[ fig_mlhist]f , we obtain the histogram plotted in panel  [ fig_mlhist]e . the spread in @xmath2 can now be completely accounted for by a random error of about 15% in the distances to these galaxies .",
    "similar projected distributions can be obtained by correcting the @xmath2 s for disk mass and luminosity @xcite .",
    "finally , we combine the results from our mass models with those from data on separate galaxies ( broeils & rhee 1997 ) to show that the dark matter fraction in galaxies , expressed as the dark - to - luminous mass fraction @xmath34 , also depends on a structural ( `` size '' ) parameter .",
    "the optical rcs themselves do not extend far enough to allow for the detection of dm .",
    "however , they provide a good estimate of the total luminous mass and of the dependence of this mass on `` size '' .",
    "the open squares in fig .",
    "[ fig_convergence ] indicate the _ luminous _ mass of the 290 galaxies used in this study , and the full line is a linear fit to these data points . in lieu of scalelengths , the maximum rotation velocity ( @xmath35 ) acts as the `` size '' parameter .",
    "the filled triangles represent _ total _ masses obtained from 1-d spectra of 103 galaxies @xcite ( fitted with a dashed line ) .",
    "it is obvious that the luminous mass fraction ( with respect to the total mass ) increases systematically with bigger galaxy size .",
    "thus , for arbitrary large systems and if the maximum - disk hypothesis holds true , the amount of dark matter per galaxy becomes negligible .",
    "the increase of luminous mass fraction with galaxy size has been known for quite some time based on optical rcs alone @xcite and rcs ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ; the presentation here shows the trend for much larger and completely independent samples . while the slope from the samples is fixed , that of our optical decompositions depends highly on the assumption of maximum - disk ( as in the case of detailed mass models for extended rcs ) .",
    "a more important contribution of the dark matter to the inner disk would cause the trend to flatten .",
    "we find that the luminosity distributions of bulges of sb  sc galaxies are best fitted by exponential profiles .",
    "using such profiles , we find that the ratio of bulge - to - disk scale lengths is close to 0.1 , as predicted by simulations of secular evolution .",
    "disk @xmath2 s obtained from maximum - disk fits to optical rcs correlate well with galaxy `` size '' . correcting for this `` size '' effect yields a narrow distribution of intrinsic @xmath2 s , which can be fully accounted for by 15% distance errors .",
