    "one of the predictions of the braneworld with large extra - dimensions is the possibility of higher - dimensional black hole .",
    "a reason for constructing higher - dimensional theories of gravity is that they provide a framework for unifying gravity with other interactions .",
    "string theory as one important candidate for such a unified theory , also predicts higher - curvature corrections to general relativity in addition to the existence of extra dimensions @xcite . for decades we know that einstein - hilbert action is only an effective gravitational action valid for small curvature or low energies and should be modified by higher - curvature terms .",
    "lovelock theory of gravity @xcite is the most appropriate one in which the equation of motion continues to remain second order avoiding ghosts .",
    "lovelock theory suggests that in higher than four dimensions , higher order terms have to be added to the usual einstein - hilbert action in order to preserve the unique properties of general relativity in four dimensions .",
    "these higher order gravity terms , are dimensionally extended euler poincar densities of two , four - dimensional and so forth manifolds .",
    "most of the researches on this subject has been concerned with second - order lovelock gravity known as einstein - gauss - bonnet ( egb ) gravity , in which terms quadratic in the curvature are added to the action @xcite . in third - order lovelock gravity , lagrangian and field",
    "equations look complicated , but particular features arising in the solutions accuses the interests to deal with the higher curvature terms in this theory .",
    "there also exist a large number of works on introducing and discussing various exact black hole solutions of third order lovelock gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , some works have been extended to general lovelock gravity to investigate the solutions and their properties @xcite .",
    "most of the researches have been done to derive solutions with maximally symmetric horizons .",
    "a generalization comes through the consideration of horizons which belong to the more general class of einstein spaces . in four dimensions ,",
    "the first explicit inhomogenous compact einstein metric was constructed by page page and then was generalized to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "after that bohm constructed metrics with non - constant curvature on products of spheres @xcite and examples in higher - dimensional spacetimes has been worked on @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of considering higher curvature terms in lovelock gravity is obtaining new static solution with nonconstant curvature horizon .",
    "in general relativity , substituting the usual @xmath1-sphere of the horizon geometry for an @xmath2-dimensional spacetime , with an @xmath1-dimensional einstein manifold will not alter the black hole potential because einstein s equations only involve the ricci tensor .",
    "the presence of the lovelock terms expose the riemann curvature tensor to the equations and the new solution seems to be obtained due to the appearance of the wyle tensor in the relation for the riemann tensor of an einstein space . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a static spacetime with generic einstein space as dimensional subspace and found that only horizons satisfying the appropriate conditions on @xmath3 are allowed , where @xmath4 is the weyl tensor .",
    "this constraint appears in the metric and changes the properties of the spacetime .",
    "various features of such black holes with nontrivial boundaries like uniqueness and stability in egb gravity were studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the birkhoffs theorem in six - dimensional egb gravity for the case of nonconstant - curvature horizons with various features has been investigated in @xcite . also the birkhoff s theorem is extended in lovelock gravity for arbitrary base manifolds using an elementary method @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that appearing higher - curvature terms in third order lovelock gravity , causes novel changes in the properties of the spacetime with nonconstant curvature manifold .",
    "some exact solutions with these kinds of manifolds in lovelock theory are presented in @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider einstein manifolds of nonconstant curvature and will investigate charged solution and its properties .",
    "in lovelock theory with @xmath5 field , a charged black hole solution is known @xcite .",
    "also classes of nonlinear electrodynamics in einstein and higher derivative gravity have been studied in @xcite . for charged black holes with maximally symmetric horizons like spherical or topological black holes , stability analysis have been performed @xcite . in @xcite , it is shown that uncharged black holes with nonconstant - curvature horizons have unstable phases .",
    "our purpose is examining the response of instability of such black holes to the charge .",
    "the paper will proceed as follows . in the next section we review the basic elements of lovelock gravity and obtain the solution for lovelock - maxwell- system with nonconstant curvature horizon making use of the expressions in warped geometry for our spacetime ansatz .",
    "also the asymptotic behaviors of the solution will be discussed . in sec . [",
    "the ] the expressions for the mass , temperature , entropy and electric potential of the solution are calculated .",
    "the stability analysis is also presented by calculating the free energy and heat capacity in small and large black hole limits for ricci flat black holes in which we predict to encounter new features .",
    "finally , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with the action of third order lovelock gravity in the presence of electromagnetic field , which is written as @xmath6where @xmath7 is the cosmological constant and @xmath8 and @xmath9  are second and third order lovelock coefficients and the maxwell field strength , or the faraday tensor , is given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vector potential .",
    "the einstein term @xmath12 equals to @xmath13 and the second order lovelock term is @xmath14 also @xmath15 is the third order lovelock lagrangian which is described as @xmath16 the third lovelock term in eq .",

    "in this study , we presented charged solution of lovelock gravity with nonconstant - curvature horizon .",
    "we considered a spacetime which is a cross product of a lorentzian spacetime and a space with nonconstant - curvature horizon . with this assumption",
    "the usual assumption of maximally symmetry is relaxed , leading to a new class of black hole solution which introduces novel chargelike parameter to the black hole potential , in addition to the electric charge .",
    "these parameters are obtained by imposing two conditions on the weyl tensor of the einstein space and appear with the advantage of higher curvature terms in third order lovelock equations .",
    "it was shown that the electric charge dominates the behavior of the metric function as @xmath0 approaching zero , and the central singularity is always timelike , in contrast with the uncharged solution which possesses a spacelike central singularity . by investigating the asymptotic behavior of the metric at infinity",

    "this property does not appear for black hole with constant - curvature horizon or the one with nonconstant - curvature horizon in second order lovelock theory .",
    "then we proceeded by calculating the mass , temperature , entropy and electric potential of the black hole in terms of horizon radius and the first law of thermodynamics was shown to be hold for this class of solution . in order to show the differences of",
    "charged and uncharged black holes with nonconstant - curvature horizons , we went through the properties of black holes with @xmath146 .",
    "we saw that extreme charged black hole could exist depending on the values of electric charge @xmath46 and @xmath147 appearing in the expression for temperature .",
    "also we mentioned that the entropy of the black hole with @xmath146 does not obey the area law exactly like that of uncharged solution . to check the stability of the solutions , confining to the canonical ensemble",
    ", we calculated the heat capacity and free energy in the small and large black hole regimes .",
    "the main difference that occurs due to the existence of charge is that @xmath148 charged solution with nonconstant - curvature horizon for @xmath149 shows a transition between a thermodynamically stable phase for very small black holes to a thermodynamically unstable phase for small ones which does not appear for uncharged black holes .",
    "also calculations show that small charged black holes have positive free energy and are globally unstable while large black holes possess negative free energy and positive heat capacity showing their stability to both perturbative and non - perturbative fluctuations .",
