    "in the recent decade the chiral effective field theory ( @xmath0eft ) has proven its predictive power in low energy nuclear physics . in the nucleon / pion sector",
    "it was successfully applied to such processes as pion - nucleon scattering , nucleon - nucleon scattering , three - nucleon reactions and to the analysis of heavier systems . for a review on the @xmath0eft and",
    "its recent applications see e.g.@xcite . among many theoretical advantages of the @xmath0eft the consistency of the derived two- and three - body forces and interrelated single and many - body electromagnetic and week currents",
    "should be mentioned .",
    "this predisposes the @xmath0eft to be used in studies of electromagnetic processes .    on the other hand ,",
    "the inclusion of the electromagnetic current can be done also in an approximate way by means of the siegert theorem  @xcite .",
    "both approaches lead to similar results for proton - deuteron ( pd ) capture and for photodisintegration processes  @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend the results of @xcite by using explicitly the chiral electromagnetic current instead of the siegert approach .",
    "we follow here the path charted in @xcite and use the single nucleon current , the leading one - pion exchange current and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contributions to the long - range part of the two - pion ( 2@xmath1 ) exchange current . in",
    "@xcite the effects of the 2@xmath1-exchange currents were explored mainly in the deuteron photodisintegration reaction .",
    "it was found that the long - range 2@xmath1-exchange current operator plays an important role for that process .    in the next section",
    "we briefly present our formalism for the nucleon - deuteron radiative capture and give details on the electromagnetic current . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we present predictions for pd - capture at two laboratory energies of the incoming deuteron : 17.5 mev and 137 mev .",
    "these deuteron energies correspond to photon energies 11.3 and 50.4 mev in the centre - of - mass system , respectively .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the radiative pd - capture process @xmath2he is connected to the two - body photodisintegration of @xmath3he via the time reversal symmetry .",
    "thus we obtain the nuclear matrix elements @xmath4 for the radiative nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) capture reaction from the matrix elements @xmath5 for the photodisintegration process .",
    "the @xmath6 can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a product of the deuteron state and a momentum eigenstate of the spectator nucleon .",
    "further , the @xmath9 is the initial three nucleon ( 3n ) bound state , @xmath10 is the @xmath11-component of the electromagnetic current operator and @xmath12 is the permutation operator with two - body permutations @xmath13 interchanging the i - th and j - th nucleons .",
    "the auxiliary state @xmath14 fulfills the faddeev - like equation  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a part of the 3n force which is symmetrical under the exchange of nucleons 2 and 3 , @xmath17 is the free 3n propagator , and @xmath18 is the t - matrix connected to the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction via the lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "we solve eq.([eq : utilde ] ) in the momentum - space in the partial wave scheme .",
    "more details on our formalism and numerical performance can be found in  @xcite . as the nuclear interaction we use the nn and 3n potentials at the next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath19lo ) developed by e.epelbaum and collaborators in  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these forces depend on two regularization parameters @xmath20 used in the regularization of the lippmann - schwinger equation and three - nucleon force and in the spectral function regularization of 2@xmath1 exchanges in the chiral nn interaction  @xcite .",
    "the values of regularization parameters @xmath20 are taken as in  @xcite and are listed below .",
    "we neglect the coulomb interaction between protons in the initial proton - deuteron system .",
    "the nuclear electromagnetic current has been developed within the same approach and presented in  @xcite and used in  @xcite .",
    "here we use the same current operator as in  @xcite , where its structure and partial wave decomposition is discussed in detail .",
    "in figs .  [ fig1]-[fig2 ] we show predictions obtained with a complete nuclear potential ( nn + 3n ) at n@xmath19lo and two models of the electromagnetic current .",
    "the light blue band comprises predictions for different values of the regularization parameters @xmath20 obtained with the single nuclear current and the leading one - pion exchange current . in predictions which contribute to the dark magenta band also long - range corrections to the 2@xmath1-exchange current are included .",
    "in addition fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] also shows the prediction based on the av18  @xcite nn force combined with the urbana ix 3n force  @xcite . in this case",
    "the electromagnetic current is a sum of the single nucleon current and two most important contributions to the meson exchange current : the so called @xmath1-like and @xmath21-like terms  @xcite . at the lower energy e@xmath22=17.5 mev",
    "the differential cross section and both ( the nucleon and the deuteron ) vector analyzing powers are rather insensitive to the values of @xmath20 , what leads to a relatively narrow bands .",
    "the predictions for tensor analyzing powers are much more sensitive to the values of the regularization parameters .",
    "the quality of the data  @xcite description is similar for both models of electromagnetic current and only slight improvement is seen after inclusion of the nlo contributions . at the higher energy e@xmath22=137 mev , all bands are much wider and no meaningful differences in predictions within two models of electromagnetic current are observed .",
    "= 17.5 mev .",
    "the light ( blue ) band corresponds to predictions which base on a single nucleon and one - pion exchange currents .",
    "the dark ( magenta ) band corresponds to predictions which base on the same currents supplemented by the long - range 2@xmath1-exchange currents at nlo ( see text ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the borders of the lighter band .",
    "the solid black line is for the av18+urbana ix and the standard meson exchange currents ( see text ) predictions .",
    "experimental data points are taken from @xcite.,width=472 ]     but for the deuteron laboratory energy e@xmath22=137 mev .",
    "experimental data points at e@xmath22=133 mev are taken from  @xcite , width=472 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show in more detail the dependence of the predictions on the value of regularization parameters .",
    "the presented lines are the same that build the dark , magenta band in fig .",
    "the values of @xmath20 are , in mev : ( 450,500),(600,500),(550,600),(450,700),(600,700 ) for the black dotted , brown double - dot - dashed , blue dot - dashed , magenta dashed and red solid curves , respectively .",
    "the strongest dependence is seen for the tensor analyzing powers .",
    "note , that predictions based on the smallest values of @xmath23 behave qualitatively similar to the reference predictions based on the av18+urbana ix model , shown in fig .",
    "this is in agreement with recent findings in elastic nd scattering at n@xmath3lo where also the smallest values of @xmath23 are favoured  @xcite .",
    "but now only contributions to the dark ( magenta ) band are shown explicitly .",
    "values of the @xmath20 parameters are given in the text.,width=472 ]    finally , we test the sensitivity of the nd - capture observables to the 3n force . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare predictions based on the nn interaction only ( light blue band ) with ones based on the full nn+3n hamiltonian ( dark magenta band ) for e@xmath22=17.5 mev . the electromagnetic current operator is again taken as a sum of the single nucleon current , the one - pion exchange current and the long - range 2@xmath1-exchange one . at this energy",
    "only predictions for the differential cross section and vector analyzing powers change after inclusion of the 3n force .",
    "however this change is not big and comparable with the bands width .",
    "for tensor analyzing powers the 3n force effects are totally hidden by the dependence on the values of the regularization parameters .",
    "the latter is true also at e@xmath22=137 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) where , additionally , the 3n force effects are seen neither for the vector analyzing powers nor for the cross section .",
    "again , for these dynamical models the bands are too broad to be useful in a study of the 3n force effects .     but now for predictions based on the nn n@xmath19lo interaction only ( light ( blue ) band ) and the full nn+3n hamiltonian at n@xmath19lo ( dark ( magenta ) band ) .",
    "the solid line and experimental data points are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1].,width=472 ]     but for the deuteron laboratory energy e@xmath22=137 mev .",
    "experimental data points from  @xcite are taken at e@xmath22=133 mev .",
    ", width=472 ]",
    "we have applied the chiral potential at n@xmath19lo combined with the electromagnetic current taken as a sum of the single nucleon current , the one - pion exchange one and the long - range nlo part of the 2@xmath1-exchange current to study the differential cross section and the analyzing powers for the nd radiative capture at deuteron energies 17.5 and 137 mev .    for most observables",
    "the effects of long - range 2@xmath1-exchange current at nlo as well as the effects of the 3n interaction at n@xmath19lo are small compared to the uncertainty coming from different values of the regularization parameters .",
    "this clearly shows that a study of the nd - capture reaction by means of @xmath0eft requires consistent currents and interactions at higher orders of the chiral expansion .",
    "in addition , more constraints should be put on the values of the regularization parameters .",
    "recently it was pointed that the dependence of the predictions for the nd elastic scattering on the regularization parameters obtained within the ( @xmath0eft ) at n@xmath3lo also leads to unacceptably large theoretical uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "it is expected , that a new regularization scheme will cure such a situation  @xcite .",
    "once it is available , it will be interesting to study the nd - capture and other electromagnetic processes again .",
    "such an investigation is planed in the future .",
