    "cr protons interact with the interstellar gas and produce neutral pions ( schematically written as @xmath2 ) , which in turn decay into gamma - rays .",
    "cosmic ray electrons can also produce gamma - rays via bremsstrahlung and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering emission .",
    "detailed calculation of the cr propagation in our galaxy using the galprop code finds that @xmath3-decay gamma - rays form the dominant component of the diffuse galactic emission ( dge ) above 100  mev , while the bremsstrahlung and ic emissions contribute a subdominant , but non - negligible fraction@xcite .",
    "gev gamma - ray emissions have also been detected from nearby star - forming and starburst galaxies@xcite , and they are interpreted as arising dominantly from cosmic ray protons colliding with the interstellar gas as well@xcite .",
    "although these theoretic arguments favor the pion - decay model for the gev gamma - ray emission in these galaxies , there is no direct evidence for such pion - decay mechanism . recently , _ fermi _ large area telescope ( hereafter lat ) detected a characteristic pion - decay feature in the gamma - ray spectrum of two supernova remnants , ic 443 and w44@xcite .",
    "the pion - decay spectrum in the usual @xmath1 representation rises steeply below 200 - 300  mev and then breaks to a softer spectrum .",
    "this characteristic spectral feature ( often referred to as the `` pion - decay bump '' ) uniquely identifies pion - decay gamma rays and thereby high - energy cr protons .    motivated by this , we attempt to study the gamma - ray spectra of nearby star - forming galaxies and examine such unique pion - decay bump spectral signature .",
    "lmc is the brightest external galaxies in gamma - ray emission , as it is very close to us ( only 50 kpc ) .",
    "lmc is near enough that individual star - forming regions can be resolved and thus their contribution can be removed so that one can obtain a relatively pure diffuse disk component .",
    "the high galactic latitude of lmc also leads to a low level of contamination due to the galactic diffuse gamma - ray emission .",
    "we analyze the fermi - lat data of lmc and pay special attention to the gamma - ray spectrum extending to 60  mev using 8 years of fermi lat pass 8 data .",
    "we find that the gamma - ray spectrum shows a rise in @xmath1 representation at low - energies and breaks to a softer spectrum at about 500 mev .",
    "our work is different from earlier works based on the fermi - lat observations of lmc , which focus on the gamma - ray emission above 200  mev .",
    "the lat pass 8 data between 2008 august 4 and 2016 august 4 are taken from the _ fermi _ science support center ( hereafter fssc ) . events with energy between 60  mev and 100  gev are selected .",

    "lmc sources are categorized into two subparts , namely , the point sources and the extended sources . besides the background point sources from 3fgl mentioned above",
    ", we also include four newly - identified point sources ( namely p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 ) in the lmc field in the analysis , which correspond to psr  j0545 - 6919 , psr  j0537 - 6910/n157b , a gamma ray binary cxou  j0536 - 6735 and n  132d respectively .",

    "we consider three possible spatial templates for the extended sources : 1 ) four 2-dimensional gaussian template model ( `` g1'',``g2'',``g3'',``g4 '' ) , which is called the `` analytic model '' in ; 2 ) a template model with the `` disk '' and `` 30 doradus '' being modeled as a 2-dimensional gaussian .",
    "this template is used for lmc in and is archived at the latest _ fermi_/lat extended source template catalog ; 3 ) a gas model of ionized hydrogen employing the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas intensity distribution(h@xmath8 ) for lmc diffusion region .",
    "this template is also used in the comparative analysis of gas models .",

    "first , we divide the events between 60  mev and 100  gev into 12 logarithmic bins and perform the binned likelihood analysis to each energy bin .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we assume a simple power law ( pl ) spectrum for all the sources in lmc .",

    "[ fig : f3 ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : binflux ] .",
    "the obtained flux in template h is higher than that in the other two templates below @xmath1015  gev .",
    "this is because there are other extend components in the template g(i.e , g2,g3,g4 ) and the template d(i.e , 30 dor ) in addition to the large - scale disk component , which is absent in the template h. above @xmath1015  gev , the fluxes of the three templates are consistent with each other due to the low number of photons . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , the spectrum has a rapid rise below about 500  mev and then transits to a much softer spectrum .    to quantify the significance of the spectral break",
    ", we fit the spectrum between 60  mev and 2.45  gev with both a single power law ( pl ) in the form @xmath11 and a smoothly broken power law ( bpl ) in the form @xmath12^{-\\alpha}$ ] with @xmath13  mev .",
    "the spectral index changes from @xmath14 to @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) at the break energy @xmath17 and the smoothness of the break is fixed at @xmath18 .",
    "the smoothly bpl model yields a significantly larger ts value than the single power law ( the square root of the ts is approximately equal to the detection significance@xcite ) , with an improvement of @xmath19 for template g , d and h respectively ( see tab . [",
    "tab : compare ] ) .",
    "the photon index in the rising part of the photon spectra is @xmath20 below the break energy of @xmath21  mev for template g , @xmath22 below @xmath23  mev for template d , and @xmath24 below @xmath25  mev for template h , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that a spectral break indeed exists in the gamma - ray emission of the lmc disk .    simultaneously comparing with above results of the three templates",
    ", the template g substantially shows the highest detection level under the best model(bpl ) , whose ts value is 468 , 290 more than that of template d , h respectively .",
    "thus we mainly analyze the data and explore the origin of emission from large - scale disk with template g in the following analysis .    in all previous works , only the data above 200  mev are involved . to compare with the case that only data above 200  mev are used",
    ", we also perform the likelihood fit in the energy range from 200  mev to 2.45  gev for the template g. we find that in this case , @xmath26 between pl and bpl cases are only about 36 , indicating a lower significance for the existence of a spectral break .",
