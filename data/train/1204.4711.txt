    "consequently , the surface oxygen vacancies suppress the polar field of lao due to the supply of the polarity - compensating excess electrons between the surface and interface layers . as a result",

    "in contrast to the biased macroscopic potential in stoichiometric structure ( fig .  [ fig9 ] ) , the macroscopically averaged potential in the structure with the surface vacancies is flat in the lao - layer , which indeed supports the complete suppression of the lao - polarity due to the surface oxygen vacancies .",
    "within dft - calculations , we considered oxygen vacancies in lao / sto heterostructures and performed studies of the orbital states at the lao / sto interface allowing for several types of vacancy arrangements . using generalized gradient approximation ( lsda ) with intra - atomic coulomb repulsion ( gga+u )",
    ", we have shown that the oxygen vacancies at the titanate interfaces produce a complex multiorbital reconstruction which involves a change of the occupancy of the @xmath2 states rather than of @xmath0 orbitals of the ti atoms nearest to the oxygen vacancies .",
    "the orbital reconstruction is accompanied by a magnetic splitting of the local @xmath2 and interface @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "this reconstruction generates a two - dimensional magnetic state not observed in bulk srtio@xmath4 .",
    "moreover , oxygen vacancies placed in the tio@xmath14 layer farther away from the interface induce a sizable magnetic moment only in the tio@xmath14 interface layer .",
    "also , oxygen vacancies in the alo@xmath14 surface where they are expected to be in the most stable configuration , generate a magnetic moment only in the interface titanate layer . in this latter case ,",
    "the electronic reconstruction mechanism due to polar catastrophe is suppressed for a vacancy concentration of @xmath133 by the charge introduced by vacancies .",
