    "metallic nanocontacts and nanowires are routinely fabricated by scanning tunneling microscopy ( _ stm _ ) or mechanically controllable break - junctions ( _ mcbj_).@xcite the size of these contacts can be as small as a single atom , so that electron transport through them is ballistic and quantized .",
    "the current is carried by quantum channels where electrons are partly transmitted and partly reflected . if perfectly transmitting , each ( spin degenerate ) channel contributes to the conductance with one quantum unit @xmath0 . a massive contact of section area @xmath1 encompasses a channel number @xmath2 and a conductance proportional to @xmath3.@xcite    experimentally one observes that when the contact ends are pulled apart the conductance decreases stepwise , showing plateaus followed by sudden jumps . in general , the values of the conductance plateaus depend on the detailed and uncontrolled contact geometry and electronic configuration , but averaging over many configurations makes it possible to plot conductance histograms which display peaks at most frequent plateau values characteristic of the nanocontact of that particular metal.@xcite the lowest conductance peak is generally of order @xmath0 , thus attributable to a monatomic contact in the likeliest geometry preceding breaking .    some metals such as gold , platinum and iridium display a tendency to form ultimately thin nanocontacts consisting of short tip - suspended monatomic chains , which have also been visualized by transmission electron microscopy @xcite and/or identified by the presence of very long plateaus in the conductance traces versus pulling distance .",
    "@xcite in these metals the lowest conductance histograms peak(s ) thus may generally correspond either to a chain or to a single atom contact . in au",
    "the peak is found at about @xmath4 ,  @xcite corresponding to a single ( spin degenerate ) @xmath5 channel . in pt , where in addition to @xmath5 electrons , @xmath6 electrons contribute to the conductance , the peak is usually found between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite    it has long been recognized that the adsorption of small gas molecules on the nanowire or very near the nanocontact may change substantially the conductance of the system , and thus the position of the peaks in the conductance histograms . for instance , in pt nanocontacts the presence of @xmath9 causes the suppression of the peak at @xmath7 and the formation of new peaks at @xmath4 and @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite in presence of co instead , the lowest conductance peak is replaced by two new peaks , a major one just above @xmath4 and a smaller one at @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite    such adsorption - induced modifications are usually rationalized by guessing a few possible adsorption geometries and calculating , via density functional theory , their landuaer - bttiker ballistic conductance .",
    "@xcite in some cases the structural assignment is further supported by comparison of the calculated and the measured frequencies of the molecular vibrational modes .",
    "for instance , in the case of @xmath9 the peak at @xmath4 could be attributed to a molecular configuration bridging linearly the two pt tips ,  @xcite while in the case of co it was shown theoretically@xcite that a conductance value of @xmath12 may be caused by a `` tilted bridge '' configuration of the co molecule between two pt contact atoms . in this case however , the peak at @xmath13 is still unexplained ; besides , several other questions remain open , calling for further theoretical investigations . to begin with , it remains to be clarified what is the electronic mechanism that binds a co molecule to a monatomic wire .",
    "experimentally , it has been suggested that the blyholder model ,  @xcite often used to explain the adsorption of co on transition metal surfaces @xcite in analogy with metal - carbonyl systems ,  @xcite could explain the relative strength of co absorption on cu , ni , pt and au nanocontacts ,  @xcite but _ ab - initio _ calculations proving this point are still lacking .",
    "moreover , in the case of heavy atomic species such as pt and au it is known that spin - orbit ( _ so _ ) effects will change the electronic structure of nanowires@xcite ( for instance altering the nature and number of conducting channels , or leading a pt nanowire to become magnetic at distances much shorter than those predicted without the explicit inclusion of _ so _",
    "coupling@xcite ) , but it is still unclear how these effects would reflect on the chemical binding of a molecule such as co to the nanocontact , or on the ballistic conductance of the system .    in order to address some of these points , we will study , via _ ab - initio _ density functional theory ( _ dft _ ) , a simplified model : a monatomic chain of pt atoms with one co molecule adsorbed on it .",
    "we consider a few possible adsorption geometries and discuss their electronic structure and ballistic conductance ( in the absence of tips ) .",
    "the role of _ so _",
    "coupling is investigated by comparing the results obtained by scalar - relativistic ( _ sr _ ) and fully - relativistic ( _ fr _ ) pseudo potentials ( _ pp _ ) ,  @xcite the latter including the _ so _  coupling .",
    "magnetic effects , which also could play a role in this system ,  @xcite are not addressed here and will be the subject of future work , along with the additional effects caused by the tips .",
    "we find that when the wire is unstrained and the nanowire atoms are kept fixed at their theoretical equilibrium distance , adsorption of co in the bridge site ( see in ) is energetically favored with respect to absorption on the on - top site .",
    "the energy of a configuration where co is joining two pt atoms ( substitutional configuration ) is much higher since the energy cost of breaking the pt - pt bond is large .",
    "hence , this configuration could possibly appear only when the pt - pt bond close to co is highly strained and almost broken . at intermediate strains a `` tilted bridge '' configuration as proposed in refs",
    ".   could moreover be energetically favorable .",
    "in this work we will focus on the upright bridge and substitutional configurations only , two examples with completely different symmetry properties . only occasional data on the structure and energetics of the on - top and `` tilted bridge ''",
    "geometries will be reported for comparison .",
    "more results on the on - top configuration are given in refs .  .",
    "our results confirm that the blyholder model @xcite explains quite well the electronic structure in the bridge and on - top geometries . in this model both the homo ( @xmath14 ) and lumo ( @xmath15 ) of the molecule form bonding - antibonding pairs with the pt states , giving rise to the so - called `` donation / back - donation '' process ( part of the @xmath14 density of states , _ dos _ , moves above the fermi energy , @xmath16 , while part of the @xmath15 _ dos _  moves below @xmath16 ) . in presence of",
    "coupling this picture retains its validity .",
    "the states involved in the donation / back - donation process are still identifiable and are in fact found to be energetically nearly at the same position as in the _ sr _  case .",
    "similar conclusions are reached in the substitutional case although some features are different from the bridge and top cases .",
    "the ballistic conductance of our ( tipless ) system , where the co adsorbate acts as the scatterer , is found to depend on geometry but is not substantially modified by the introduction of _ so _",
    "coupling . the theoretical _ sr _",
    "( _ fr _ ) conductance is @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) in the bridge configuration , only slightly reduced in comparison to the perfect pt nanowire ( whose theoretical value is @xmath19 , see ref .  ) . in the substitutional geometry",
    "we find instead a conductance of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , thus much smaller than the value of the pristine nanowire .",
    "although tipless results are clearly not directly comparable with experiments , they are consistent with the calculations of @xcite , which show a large reduction of conductance when the co passes from the upright bridge to the tilted bridge configuration .    this paper is organized as follows : in we briefly describe the methods and some technical details . in",

    "the @xmath219 contribution to the transmission ( not shown ) is almost zero , since the @xmath219 channels have @xmath148 orbital components that are completely blocked by the co. it should be pointed out here that the details of all channels will be modified by the onset of magnetism,@xcite and this could in principle modify the ballistic conductance of our system .",
    "this aspect however is beyond the scopes of this work .",
    "although as was said above our conductance values can not be directly compared with experimental data because they do not include the effect of the tips , they do indicate that in the substitutional configuration the conductance is about @xmath242 times lower than in the upright bridge configuration,@xcite where at difference with the substitutional the @xmath137 channels are not so strongly reflected .",
    "the pt states with angular momentum @xmath148 are ( more or less strongly ) blocked in both cases , but for different reasons : in the bridge geometry they interact more with co and this perturbs a lot the @xmath148 _ pdos _  on the neighbouring pt ; in the substitutional there is no co orbital with the matching symmetry and thus the @xmath148 channel is totally blocked by the molecule . anyway , since these states fall below the fermi level , their interaction with the molecule does not influence the conductance .",

    "the substitutional geometry has quite a high energy hence it could be a realistic configuration only when the wire is under high strain and almost broken . also in this case there occurs a hybridization between the pt states and the co molecular orbitals which gives rise to a donation / back - donation process .",
    "we showed that the inclusion of _ so _",
    "coupling , which strongly modifies the electronic band structure of the pt wire , does not change very much the interaction mechanism and strength between the co molecule and the wire .",
    "the adsorption of co on bridge ( and also on - top ) geometry should not affect much the chain ballistic conductance , since the pt states mainly involved in the interaction with co  and therefore partially or totally reflected  are located mainly below or above the fermi level . in the substitutional geometry instead the molecule can partially transmit only @xmath139 states , while all other channels are blocked .",
    "our findings confirm the speculation by @xcite based on the measured conductances of transition metal nanocontacts , namely that the blyholder model rules the adsorption strength of co. regarding the transport properties , our results agree with those of @xcite in predicting that a considerable reduction of the ballistic conductance can be obtained when co goes substitutional , and that the main conducting channel comes from a pt @xmath139@xmath15 hybridization ( while @xmath137 states should not be conducting ) .",
