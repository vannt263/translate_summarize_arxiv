    "is a high - energy transient in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) system , and only the second source , besides the rapid burster @xcite , observed to emit multiple type ii x - ray bursts , i.e. , due to spasmodic accretion rather than thermonuclear burning .",
    "the source was discovered in 1996 with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ , when it emitted a series of hard x - ray bursts during a period lasting @xmath6 days @xcite .",
    "soon after its discovery , @xcite reported that the timing properties of the persistent x - ray emission pointed towards a magnetized neutron star pulsating at 2.14  hz , accreting material from a low - mass companion in a nearly circular orbit with an orbital period of 11.8  days . at that time",
    "was the first source to show bursts and pulsations , hence the source was nicknamed `` the bursting pulsar '' ( hereafter bp ) .",
    "the bp emerged from quiescence again almost exactly one year after its first outburst , in december 1996 @xcite .",
    "this second outburst was very similar to the first including both burst and persistent x - ray emission characteristics @xcite .",
    "the bp and its two outbursts were studied extensively during the first few years after its discovery .",
    "the x - ray bursts from the source were classified as type ii bursts , based on their spectra , energetics @xcite , and their resemblance to the bursts observed from the rapid burster @xcite .",
    "type ii bursts are most likely the result of some sort of instability ( whose origin is still unknown ) in the accretion disk resulting in the onset of mass inflow onto the neutron star which is responsible for the bursting activity .",
    "the bp average burst duration was 10  s and each burst was followed by a dip in flux below that of the pre - burst persistent emission .",
    "the flux recovered exponentially back to the pre - burst persistent emission level on time - scales of a few hundred seconds @xcite .",
    "pulsations at the spin frequency of the source were also detected during bursts , albeit with an average time lag of about 50 ms compared to the pre - burst pulses @xcite .",
    "the pre - burst pulse profile was subsequently recovered on timescales of a few hundred seconds @xcite .",
    "@xcite attributed these lags to the accretion column geometry at the pole .",

    "* see also @xcite ) placed an upper limit on the dipole magnetic field of @xmath7  g based on the spin - up rate of the source and the persistent pulsed luminosity .",
    "@xcite deduced from binary evolution calculations that the dipole magnetic field of  lies in the range of @xmath8  g , with a most probable value of @xmath9  g. finally , @xcite derived a surface magnetic field of @xmath10  g , assuming that the propeller effect is the reason for the non - detection of x - ray pulsations when the source persistent flux dropped below a certain level .",
    "it is , therefore , likely that the surface magnetic field of the bp lies between classical x - ray accreting pulsars ( @xmath11  g ) and lmxbs ( @xmath12  g ) .",
    "this intermediate strength surface field could be an important parameter defining the unusual properties of this source ; hence , the determination of its exact value is of crucial importance .",

    "we observed the bp with _",
    "chandra _  using the high energy transmission grating ( hetg ) in continuous clocking mode ( cc - mode ) with all six ccds of the acis - s array .",
    "the hetg comprises two sets of gratings , the medium energy grating ( meg ) , operating in the energy range of @xmath21  kev , and the high energy grating ( heg ) with energy coverage in the range of @xmath22  kev , and a spectral resolution ( fwhm ) @xmath23  ev .",
    "each grating spectrum is dispersed along the acis - s ccds into positive and negative spectral orders .",
    "in addition , each grating observation results in an on - axis undispersed image with the ccd spectral resolution .",

    "the observation took place on 2014 march 3 , 08:59:06 utc , with 10  ks of good time intervals ( gti ) .",
    "a comparison between the zeroth order and the dispersed heg  @xmath24 first order light curve reveals that the bursts are completely missing from the zeroth order light curve due to heavy pile - up .",
    "the source persistent emission also suffered a @xmath25 pile - up effect in the zeroth order . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersed grating spectra have a much lower total count rate compared to that of the zeroth order spectra .",
    "this results in spectra free of pile - up except during the peak of the bursts when pile - up still occurred at the @xmath25 level .    to use the grating arms in our timing analysis ,",
    "the photons assigned times needed to be corrected for their diffraction angle , which is directly proportional to the grating time offset with respect to the zeroth order .",

    "the use of cc - mode with any _ chandra _  grating observation introduces some complications to the data reduction and analysis .",
    "for instance , due to the fact that there is no spatial information ( the clocking rows are all collapsed into one pixel ) , the soft x - ray background , usually low in te mode , is enhanced by 3 orders of magnitude .     and @xmath0 arms of both the heg and meg 1st order spectra .",
    "the wiggle seen in the heg  p1 spectrum between 2 and 6  kev is not detected in any of the other three spectra .",
    "we conclude that this shape is artificial and refrain from using the heg  p1 in the non - burst spectral analyses.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] +    a more pressing issue , that can alter grating dispersed spectra in cc - mode , is the dust scattering halo , usually present around bright absorbed sources .",
    "the bp resides in the galactic center region , hence , it is heavily absorbed , with a hydrogen column density @xmath14  @xmath15 .",
    "the brightness of the source produces a diffuse scattering halo , the emission from which disperses and blends with the source dispersed spectrum .",
    "the significance of this effect depends on the incident source spectrum , with hard sources affected less than soft ones .",
    "luckily , the bp has a hard x - ray spectrum ( section  [ specana ] ) which reduces the impact of this background on the source spectrum .",
    "since no spatial information exists when using cc - mode , we extract the meg and heg backgrounds using the order sorting plots , which display the energies of the dispersed events versus the ratios of these energies over the event positions on the grating arm@xmath34 . on - axis point - source photons should distribute tightly and symmetrically around the extraction order , while diffuse photons have a larger scatter . finally , the extracted background is normalized to the excluded source region .",

    "to check for potential differences , all _ chandra _  analyses were initially performed on the separate heg and meg arms .",
    "temporal analysis returned consistent results between all the different arms .",
    "spectral analyses , on the other hand , showed that the heg  p1 ( hereafter , p1 refers to the positive and m1 to the negative first order grating arms ) spectrum is markedly different from the rest , i.e. , meg  p1 , meg  m1 , and heg  m1 .",
    "figure  [ calibration ] shows a pl fit to the different spectral arms , where a wiggle between 2 and 6  kev is present only in the heg  p1 spectrum .",
    "we conclude that this feature is not real , and most likely due to either miscalibration , an improper modeling of the background , or both .",
    "hence , the heg  p1 arm is excluded from the spectral analyses , except for bursts , where the above feature is not present ( likely due to the small integration times during bursts and/or the fact that the emission during burst intervals includes minimal background ) .",

    "this value is consistent with the observed bursts being type  ii bursts , similar to what is seen in the rapid burster , caused by some sort of instability associated with the accretion disk @xcite . unlike the rapid burster",
    ", however , the bp does not display any correlation between the fluence in a burst and the time to the following burst ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a very simple picture would be that accretion - disk instabilities would allow for a sudden and rapid increase of the mass - inflow rate onto the polar cap of the neutron star from a reservoir ( e.g. , the accretion disk ) .",
    "the dips , then , would be the result of a small fraction of the continuously accreted matter disappearing to replenish this reservoir .",
    "the broadband spectrum of the bp is the typical spectrum of an accreting x - ray pulsar at high accretion rates ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "it is well fit with a hard component , modeled as a pl with an exponential rolloff , an fe line complex , a soft component modeled with a bb , and a 10  kev feature , all modified by absorption . in the following , we will discuss these different components and their interplay between persistent , dip , and burst emission , except for the fe line complex which is discussed in section  [ disfe ] .",
    "the high persistent x - ray luminosity of  during the present observation ( @xmath156  erg  s@xmath19 ) implies that the emission is coming from an accretion column , where the kinetic energy of the infalling gas onto the polar cap is converted to radiation via a radiative shock above the thermal mound @xcite .",
    "thermal photons from the mound , as well as cyclotron and bremsstrahlung radiation , are converted to high - energy photons via inverse compton scattering .",
    "hence , the resulting x - ray spectrum will depend on several parameters such as the geometry of the system and the properties of the compact source @xmath0 mainly its dipole magnetic field @xmath0 among others @xcite .",
    "even with the small dipole magnetic field of , and its complicated accretion geometry @xcite , the parameters we derive from our phenomenological fit compare reasonably well to other accreting x - ray pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the photon index of the _ cutoffpl _ is slightly lower than in most cases implying a harder spectrum , which could be the result of the higher luminosity of the source .",
    "simply put , a higher accretion rate onto the poles , would lead to a higher electron density in the accretion column and to higher compton @xmath157parameter causing a harder spectrum .",
    "the  spectrum also shows a lower energy rolloff compared to other sources , which could be due to the relatively low magnetic field of the source @xcite .",
    "the 10  kev feature is not unique to , and has previously been reported in other accreting x - ray pulsars , e.g. , vela  x-1 ( * ? ? ?",

    "this feature is not always necessarily observed as an absorption trough and sometimes manifests itself as a broad emission feature or a wiggle .",
    "it is believed to be the result of modeling accreting x - ray pulsar spectra with simple empirical functions , when the true physics giving rise to their x - ray spectra is far more complicated , especially when they are emitting near the eddington limit ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion ) . in a few cases , however , such as in the case of the be / x - ray binary swift  j1626.6@xmath05156 @xcite",
    ", an absorption line at 10  kev was interpreted as a cyclotron resonance scattering feature ( crsf ) , evidenced by the presence of a weak second harmonic and the fact that the b field strength , derived from the line energy , was consistent to the value derived from the spin - up rate of the source @xcite .",
    "in the 10  ks of _ nustar _",
    "data that we consider here , we find no evidence of a second harmonic at about twice the energy of the 10  kev feature ( i.e. , @xmath158  kev ) , and the @xmath159field strength corresponding to the line energy ( @xmath160  g for a 10  kev line energy ) is significantly larger than the estimates we derive in section 4.4 . moreover ,",
    "crsfs usually show strong dependence with pulse phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we do not observe in our phase - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "hence , we consider the 10  kev feature in  spectrum to be a defect of our continuum modeling .",
    "we note , however , that unlike the bp , other x - ray pulsars showing 10  kev features invariably show crsfs .    soft excess emission",

    "such reprocessed emission also pulsates at the pulse period of the hard x - ray component , most likely with a lower pulsed fraction due to the large area where the reprocessing is taking place .",
    "this is in agreement with both the change of the bb temperature and flux with pulse phase ( figure  [ phaseresspec ] ) , and the slight decrease of the pf at low energies compared to the high energies ( figure  [ rmsvsene ] ) . under this assumption and for isotropic emission ,",
    "the inner radius of the disk is , @xmath161 @xcite , where @xmath42 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath162 is the non - thermal x - ray luminosity , and @xmath163 is the bb temperature in k. the temperature we calculate , however , is the apparent temperature of the plasma and is related to the effective temperature through a color - correction ( or hardness ) factor , @xmath164 @xcite , which is usually taken to be between 1.5 and 2 .",
    "hence , the true inner radius of the bb emission area is @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath166  cm ( 3@xmath42 confidence ) , for @xmath167 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected small accretion disk radius considering the low b field of the source and its high luminosity .",
    "the burst broadband spectrum requires only emission from the non - thermal component , with fit parameters similar to the ones we derive for the persistent emission .",
    "this reinforces our above picture where we envisioned the burst emission to be the result of a sudden increase of the mass accretion rate onto the neutron - star pole .",
    "the non - detection of the bb component implies that the reprocessing of the non - thermal emission may not have taken place during bursts .",
    "this is possible , for instance , if the burst emission is anisotropic away from the reprocessing material , i.e. , the inner accretion disk .",
    "such anisotropy for the bp has already been discussed by @xcite and @xcite to explain the extremely high luminosities of the bursts during the previous two outbursts , which reached luminosities two orders of magnitude above eddington .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the timing properties of the source , for which the hard x - ray pf has been seen to increase prominently during the bursts @xcite .",
    "finally , the broadband spectrum of the dip intervals is similar to the persistent emission spectrum .",
    "the flux deficiency during dips is primarily seen in the non - thermal component , where the _ cutoffpl _ flux decreased by @xmath25 compared to the persistent emission flux .",

    "gaussian line fit to the @xmath148  kev excess has energy , width , ew , and flux consistent within @xmath96 between persistent and dip emission ( table  [ persisprop ] ) . the excess emission is not detected during bursts , which means that either the super - eddington burst x - ray luminosity fully ionized the line - emitting region , including the fe  k region , or that the line strength remained more or less constant during bursts , but was masked by the very bright continuum . to explore the first possibility , we simulated the same xstar grid as above , but instead of the persistent x - ray luminosity , we used the x - ray luminosity as derived from the bursts .",
    "we fit this xstar table to the burst spectrum and derived a 3@xmath42 lower limit on the ionization parameter @xmath196 .",
    "this limit represents the lowest ionization state that would result in the featureless spectrum that we see during bursts .",
    "this lower limit translates into an upper - limit on the radius of the ionized material of @xmath197  cm .",
    "hence , the burst luminosity is capable of fully ionizing the region of the disk where the highly ionized lines are thought to originate ( @xmath198  cm ) . at the @xmath131 upper limit",
    ", it is capable of fully ionizing the region of the neutral fe ( @xmath199  cm ) .",
    "this result does not exclude the second possibility .",
    "similar to the previous two outbursts from , the increase in the x - ray luminosity of the source is accompanied by an increase in the spin period of the neutron star ( gbm pulsar team , see footnote 2 ) . this spin - up factor and persistent pulsed emission",
    "indicate that the accretion onto the neutron star is not quenched at the disk - magnetosphere boundary , i.e. , the propeller effect is not acting . for spin - up to occur during accretion",
    ", the inner disk rotational frequency at the magnetospheric radius has to be greater than the neutron star spin frequency , which results in an upper limit on the magnetic dipole field of ,    @xmath200    where @xmath187 is the total x - ray luminosity assuming a distance of 8  kpc , @xmath201 is the gravitational constant , @xmath202 and @xmath188 are the mass and radius of the neutron star , taken to be 1.4  @xmath203 and 10  km , @xmath79 is the neutron star spin frequency , and @xmath204 is a dimensionless parameter between 0.5 and 1 @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that the true upper - limit is lower than the above derived value since the source started spinning - up at earlier stages in the outburst when the source luminosity was lower .    assuming that the bb component is the result of reprocessing in the inner regions of the accretion disk",
    ", we could also use the bb radius estimate ( section  [ discussbbs ] ) to derive the strength of the dipole field of the source .",
    "the inner accretion disk radius can be written as    @xmath206    with @xmath207 .",
    "we find    @xmath208    which is consistent with the above upper - limit and the expected low dipole field of the source .",
    "we studied the broad - band x - ray emission ( @xmath3  kev ) of the bp from a @xmath209  h simultaneous _",
    "nustar_-_chandra _  observation during its third detected outburst since discovery and after nearly 18 years of quiescence .",
    "these data were taken a few days before the outburst reached its peak .",
    "a total of seven bursts are detected during our observation .",
    "temporal analysis revealed that the first six bursts have comparable shapes , consisting of a single pulse with duration of @xmath150  s , and a faster rise than decay time .",
    "the last burst has a double - peaked morphology with a duration of about 25  s. all seven bursts , however , have equal fluences with an average of about @xmath210  erg  @xmath15 . similar to previous results , we find an average ratio of the burst to the persistent emission fluence @xmath211 ( with the exception of one burst where @xmath153 ) , pointing to the type  ii origin for the bursts .",
    "each of the seven bursts is followed by a dip in the persistent emission flux , which recovers exponentially with a characteristic time - scale @xmath212  s. we find an average missing fluence in the dip of about @xmath210  erg  @xmath15 , consistent with the fluence emitted in the bursts .",
    "this indicates that the energy emitted during the burst is compensated for in the dip , and that the long - term accretion rate is constant .",
    "the pulse - profiles of the persistent and the dip intervals are nearly sinusoidal with only weak contribution from the second harmonic .",
    "the pf increases from about 10% at 4  kev to 15% at 13  kev , and remains constant thereafter .",
    "the bp persistent and dip broadband spectra are identical and well fit with a bb with @xmath213  kev , a _ cutoffpl _ with an index @xmath214 and an energy rolloff @xmath215  kev , a 10  kev feature assumed to be the result of inadequate modeling of the _ cutoffpl _ , and a 6.7  kev emission feature , all modified by neutral absorption .",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopy shows that the bb and the _ cutoffpl _ components show variations at the pulse period of the source , both getting harder at pulse maximum , whereas no significant changes are seen in the 10  kev and the 6.7  kev feature .    assuming that the bb is reprocessing of the non - thermal emission in the inner regions of the accretion disk , we derive an inner disk radius @xmath216  cm .",
    "this radius translates into a dipole magnetic field of @xmath5  g.    the _ chandra_/hetg spectrum resolved the 6.7  kev feature into ( quasi-)neutral and highly ionized fe  xxv and fe  xxvi narrow emission lines . modeling the highly ionized lines with xstar places the emitting region at a distance of",
    "about @xmath217  cm from the neutron star , consistent with an accretion disk corona origin . using a similar xstar grid to model the ( quasi- ) neutral fe",
    ", we find that it originates from a distance @xmath218  cm , most likely the outer regions of an accretion disk .    the broadband burst spectrum , with a peak flux more than an order of magnitude higher than eddington , is well fit with a _ cutoffpl _ and a 10  kev feature , with similar fit values compared to the persistent and dip spectra .",
    "the burst spectrum , however , lacks a thermal component ( bb ) and fe features .",
    "if the burst emission were anisotropic ( beamed ) , the lack of the bb component is expected since no reflection of the burst photons on the inner disk would take place .",
    "similarly the fe xxv , fexxvi , and the neutral fe lines would remain at the flux levels detected in the persistent and dip emission and , therefore , are too weak to be detected above the strong burst continuum . if , on the other hand , the burst emission is isotropic , we show that the disk region where the fe xxv and fexxvi lines would be produced is now fully ionized ; the neutral iron line could still be at very low levels and masked by the continuum . in that case , however , we would expect a strong bb component , which is not detected .",
    "we conclude that , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the burst emission is highly beamed .",
