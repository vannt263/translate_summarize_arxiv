    "neutron star crusts , which are composed of inhomogeneous neutron - rich nuclear matter embedded in a roughly uniform neutralizing background of electrons , can be unique laboratories to provide us with simultaneous manifestations of superfluids , liquid crystals , and solids .",
    "this is because nuclear matter at subnuclear densities and sufficiently low temperatures can exhibit various mixed phases of a liquid composed of protons and neutrons and a neutron gas as a result of the combined effect of the tensor , isoscalar part of the nuclear force and the coulomb interaction , while keeping both the liquid and the gas in a superfluid state thanks to the central , isovector part of the nuclear force @xcite .",
    "the crustal region , which is located in the outer part of a neutron star , is observationally more relevant than the inner part , namely , the core region , because of the closer distance to the star s magnetosphere and surface , from which electromagnetic emission occurs .",
    "from the viewpoint of condensed matter physics , however , the deeper , the more interesting . in fact , roughly spherical nuclei ( liquid part ) , which are predicted to form a body - centered cubic ( bcc ) lattice at relatively low densities , are considered to fuse into rod - like nuclei in a gas of neutrons when the spherical nuclei become so closely packed as to be almost unstable with respect to quadrupolar deformations .",
    "as the density increases further , it is expected that the shape of the liquid part in the crust changes from spherical to cylindrical ( rod ) , slab , cylindrical - hole ( tube ) , and spherical - hole ( bubble ) structures until matter becomes uniform @xcite .",
    "the rod , slab , tube , and bubble structures are often referred to as nuclear pasta . since the spherical and bubble phases are solids while the cylindrical , slab , and cylindrical - hole phases are liquid crystals , possible observations of global free oscillations from neutron stars could be useful for obtaining information about elastic and superfluid properties of neutron star interiors @xcite .",
    "this technique is known as asteroseismology , which is essentially the same as seismology in the case of the earth and helioseismology in the case of the sun .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that the neutron star s properties such as the mass and radius , the equation of state ( eos ) of matter therein , and the magnetic properties would be possible to obtain via the spectra of the star s oscillations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "neutron star asteroseimology is unique in the sense that in addition to electromagnetic waves , gravitational waves radiating from the star are expected to provide us with information about the star s global oscillations @xcite .",
    "direct gravitational wave detections from neutron stars , which have yet to be done , would be highly promising in the near future .    meanwhile , there are x - ray observational evidences for neutron star oscillations .",
    "in fact , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) were discovered in the x - ray afterglow of giant flares from soft - gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) @xcite , which are supposed to be strongly magnetized neutron stars @xcite .",
    "although there are still many uncertainties in understanding of the mechanism of the giant flares and the subsequent qpos , it is generally accepted that the qpos arise from global oscillations of the neutron stars .",
    "the observed qpo frequencies are in the range of tens hz up to khz , while typical frequencies of neutron star acoustic oscillations are around khz @xcite .",
    "particularly , identification of the qpo frequencies lower than @xmath1 hz is not straightforward but could significantly constrain the possible origin of the qpos .",
    "basically , candidates for the corresponding global oscillations are crustal torsional oscillations , magnetic oscillations , and coupled oscillations between these two .",
    "global magnetic oscillations in neutron stars depend crucially on the magnetic field strength and structure therein @xcite , but those are still poorly known , particularly in superconducting materials , as well as the eos for matter in the core . in order to avoid such uncertainties , in this paper",
    "we simply consider the observed low - lying qpos as crustal torsional oscillations .",
    "in fact , within such identifications , one can obtain information about the crustal properties by fitting the calculated eigenfrequencies to the observed qpo frequencies @xcite .",
    "because of the success in accurately reproducing all the qpo frequencies , this kind of approach might well play the role of a canonical model for the low - lying qpos from sgrs .",
    "there is nevertheless a serious caveat : to obtain the shear modulus that is consistent with the qpo frequencies , one requires a significantly large value of the parameter @xmath0 that characterizes the density dependence of the symmetry energy of nuclear matter , as compared with what various nuclear observables suggest .",
    "so far , several calculations of the eigenfrequencies of crustal torsional oscillations have been done by including the effect of superfluidity , but the effect of the possible existence of the pasta structure has been neglected in most of such calculations ; an artificial shear modulus has been at most taken into consideration for the pasta phases @xcite .",
    "since the crystalline structure in the bubble phase is presumably the same as that in the low density region composed of spherical nuclei , however , one can likewise calculate the eigenfrequencies of the torsional oscillations in the bubble phase . as we shall see , furthermore",
    ", the smectic - a liquid - crystalline properties in the phase with slab - shaped nuclei @xcite do not allow torsional shear oscillations to occur in linear analysis , which leads to the conclusion that the torsional oscillations in the bubble phase can be excited separately from those in the low density regime . bearing this in mind",
    ", we search for a better fitting to the observed low - lying qpo frequencies while keeping the value of @xmath0 reasonable .    in sec .",

    "we start with description of the equilibrium configuration of a neutron star crust . in this description , we need the eos of equilibrated crustal matter . for simplicity , we assume that the temperature of the matter is zero . this is a very good approximation in analyzing the crust s equilibrium configuration and eigenfrequencies of its torsional oscillations , but is not necessarily so in describing damping of such oscillations , which is beyond the scope of the present analysis .    as discussed in @xcite , the bulk energy per nucleon of uniform nuclear matter at zero temperature",

    "since @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 characterize the saturated , nearly symmetric nuclear matter , these three parameters are relatively well constrained from empirical data for masses and radii of stable nuclei as compared to the remaining parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 , which characterize the way the energy changes as the baryon density changes from the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter . with increasing @xmath6 , the saturation density @xmath16 and energy @xmath17 changes from @xmath9 and @xmath8 as @xmath18 @xmath19    two of the authors @xcite",

    "the most relevant values of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath12 were obtained by fitting the calculated mass excess , charge radius , and charge number of stable nuclei to the empirical data for given values of @xmath23 and @xmath10 . to obtain the equilibrium nuclear shape and size in neutral matter in the crust , furthermore , @xcite have derived the optimal energy density and nucleon distribution as a function of @xmath5 within a wigner - seitz approximation by taking into account the presence of a gas of dripped neutrons and a uniform electron gas , as well as the five nuclear shapes ( sphere , cylinder , slab , tube , bubble ) .",
    "the eos parameter sets adopted in this paper are shown in table [ tab : sh - density ] .",
    "we turn to the equilibrium phase transitions between various nuclear shapes . for description of such phase transitions for various sets of the eos parameters @xmath0 and @xmath10 , as in @xcite",
    ", we obtain the optimal energy densities of the five liquid - gas mixed phases and the homogeneous phase at given baryon density and then identify the phase with minimal energy density , i.e. , the equilibrium phase .",
    "note that all the phase transitions considered here are of first order . in a star , where the pressure increases continuously with depth ,",
    "the baryon density is discontinuous at the transition points . since such discontinuities are negligibly small",
    ", however , we will regard it as continuous in calculating the star s structure .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nb - l ] , for each eos parameter set ( @xmath10 , @xmath0 ) , we display the resultant baryon density at the phase transitions from spherical to cylindrical nuclei ( sp - c ) , from cylindrical to slablike nuclei ( c - s ) , from slablike to cylindrical - hole nuclei ( s - ch ) , from cylindrical - hole to spherical - hole ( bubble ) nuclei ( ch - sh ) , and from spherical - hole nuclei to uniform matter ( sh - u ) , respectively . in this figure ( left panel )",
    ", the @xmath0 dependence of the transition densities is remarkable in the sense that all the transition densities seemingly converge to @xmath24 @xmath25 with increment in @xmath0 .",
    "this is because a larger @xmath0 , or , equivalently , a smaller symmetry energy at subnuclear densities , acts to decrease the density of a liquid part ( see eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) ) and simultaneously increase the density of a gas of dripped neutrons , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "6 of @xcite . moreover , the @xmath10 dependence of the transition densities is implicit in the fluctuating pattern of each transition line : the larger @xmath10 , the larger transition density .",
    "instead of these transition baryon densities , we plot , in right panel , @xmath26 where we set @xmath5 to the transition densities .",
    "apparently , @xmath26 has only a weak dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "this is because the tendency that @xmath9 decreases with increasing @xmath10 , which comes mainly from the fitting to empirical charge radii of stable nuclei @xcite , plays a role in counteracting the @xmath10 dependence of the transition densities .",
    "incidentally , the latter dependence stems partly from the conclusion of a liquid - drop model @xcite that each shape transition occurs when the volume fraction of a liquid part reaches a critical constant value and partly from the fact that at large neutron excess , @xmath10 affects the relation between the volume fraction and the baryon density by increasing the density of a liquid part ( see eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) ) .    additionally , in table [ tab : sh - density ] , we list the values of the phase transition density from spherical to cylindrical nuclei , from cylindrical - hole to spherical - hole nuclei , and from spherical - hole nuclei to uniform matter .",
    "we remark that all the pasta structures are predicted to appear for all the eos parameter sets shown in this table except the cases of @xmath27 and @xmath28 in mev . in practice ,",
    "no pasta structures appear for the case of @xmath29 , i.e. , spherical nuclei transform directly to uniform matter at @xmath30 @xmath25 , while only the bubble structure is absent for @xmath27 , i.e. , cylindrical - hole nuclei transform to uniform matter at @xmath31 @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the maximum value of @xmath0 for the bubble structure to appear in neutron stars is predicted to be @xmath32 mev . for any pasta structures to appear , which is of order 100 mev ,",
    "has already been discussed in @xcite in terms of fission - like instability of spherical nuclei as well as proton clustering instability in uniform nuclear matter at subnuclear densities . ]",
    "since we focus on torsional oscillations confined in the bubble phase in this work , we shall consider only the cases with @xmath33 mev .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "we proceed to compare the observed qpo frequencies from sgrs with the calculated frequencies of torsional oscillations in the bubble phase , together with those of usual torsional oscillations in the crustal region composed of spherical nuclei .",
    "we have already discussed the possibility of identifying the observed lowest three qpos ( 18 , 30 , 92.5 hz ) except the 26 hz qpo in the giant flare of sgr 1806@xmath3420 as the @xmath35 , 3 , 10 fundamental crustal torsional oscillations @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble - m14r12 ] , we show such an identification in sgr 1806@xmath3420 for the stellar models with @xmath36 and @xmath37 km",
    ". one can find from this figure that the most suitable value of @xmath0 for explaining the qpos in terms of the crustal torsional oscillations that have the entrainment effect included by following @xcite is @xmath38 mev .",
    "we remark that the qpo frequency ( 57 hz ) discovered from the shorter and less energetic recurrent 30 bursts @xcite can also be identified as the @xmath39 fundamental crustal torsional oscillation with the same value of @xmath0 . with all these successful identifications ,",
    "there is a problem with explaining the remaining qpo frequency , i.e. , 26 hz , because the interval between 26 and 30 hz is too small to explain by the fundamental crustal torsional oscillations with neighboring @xmath40 as long as the lowest qpo is identified as the lowest crustal torsional mode with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "note that if the lowest qpo is identified as the crustal torsional mode with @xmath41 , one can explain all the low - lying qpos in terms of the crustal torsional modes only when the value of @xmath0 is assumed to be of order or even larger than 100 mev @xcite , being significantly larger than the values deduced from experiments @xcite .    20 with the crustal torsional oscillations calculated for the stellar model with @xmath36 and @xmath37 km .",
    "the horizontal lines denote the observed qpo frequencies , where the dot - dash lines correspond to 18 , 26 , 30 , and 92.5 hz discovered in the giant flare , and the broken line corresponds to 57 hz found from the shorter and less energetic recurrent 30 bursts .",
    "the solid lines represent the calculated @xmath35 , 3 , 6 , and 10 fundamental frequencies of torsional oscillations in the crustal region composed of spherical nuclei .",
    "the vertical solid line denotes the most suitable value of @xmath0 , 73.5 mev , for explaining the observed qpos except 26 hz in terms of the crustal torsional oscillations .",

    "the dotted line is the result for the 50 @xmath43 participant ratio . ]",
    "it is thus interesting to search for the possibility of explaining the 26 hz qpo in terms of torsional oscillations in the bubble phase in the same stellar model .",
    "recall that these modes can coexist with crustal torsional oscillations in the phase of spherical nuclei , thanks to vanishing shear modulus in the slab phase , and that the @xmath35 fundamental frequency of torsional oscillations in the bubble phase is expected to lie in a range between the frequencies shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:0t2-m14r12 ] in the cases of the maximal and minimal enthalpy that contributes to the torsional oscillations .",
    "this range corresponds to the shaded region in fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble - m14r12 ] .",
    "interestingly , 26 hz is in the middle of this range at the optimal @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , to identify the 26 hz qpo as the fundamental torsional oscillation in the bubble phase , the participant ratio @xmath42 should be close to 50 @xmath43 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble - m14r12 ] . here",
    ", the participant ratio is closely related to the entrainment effect ; to deduce what portion of nucleons outside bubbles are locked to the motion of the bubbles , we have only to know the participant ratio in the absence of the entrainment effect , which is of order 520 @xmath43 .",
    "note that the @xmath0 values at which the bubble phase is predicted to occur marginally contain the optimal value of 73.5 mev .",
    "this suggests that neutron stars of @xmath44 and @xmath45 km are favored by the present scenario that requires the presence of bubbles , because the calculated eigenfrequencies and hence the optimal value of @xmath0 tend to decrease with increasing @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 .    to demonstrate that the above scenario works more reasonably for larger and heavier neutron stars",

    "[ fig : bubble - m18r14 ] .",

    "we remark in passing that the optimal participant ratio in the bubble phase changes with the stellar model , which may open up the way of constraining the star s mass and radius once the entrainment effect is known from band calculations .     for @xmath48 and @xmath49 km .",
    "in this case , the dotted line is the result for the 70 @xmath43 participant ratio . ]",
    "in summary , we have examined torsional oscillations in the bubble phase located just above the crust - core boundary of neutron stars .",
    "the corresponding eigenfrequencies of the fundamental modes have been calculated for various models of the crust eos , for various values of the star s mass and radius , as well as for various values of the participant ratio that reflects the entrainment effect , i.e. , what portion of nucleons outside the bubbles comove with the oscillating bubbles .",
