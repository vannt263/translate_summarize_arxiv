    "bosonization is a standard approach to the problem of interacting electrons in one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite .",
    "bosonization maps the low - energy spectrum of the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model on the spectrum of free bosons .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a new method of treating such system .",
    "we explicitly construct a unitary operator @xmath0 diagonalizing tl hamiltonian .",
    "our unitary transformation maps the tl model on a system of free fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "the description of the tl model in terms of these quasiparticles has several advantages over bosonization , as we will see below .",
    "the diagonalizing procedure is closely related to the bosonization .",
    "the operator @xmath0 can be thought of as a bogoliubov transformation in the space of particle - hole pair excitations .",
    "alternatively , one can describe the action of @xmath0 as a sequence of bosonization , bogoliubov transformation which diagonalizes the bosonic hamiltonian and further refermionization ( fig.1 ) .",
    "when the dispersion of the physical electrons is linear both the quasiparticles and the bosons offer equally good description of the tl model .",
    "if the non - linear terms are substantial the free boson representation breaks down .",
    "the fermionic quasiparticles show more resilience toward deviations from the linear dispersion",
    ". they remain free as long as the bare interaction constant is sufficiently small .",
    "this latter property of the quasiparticle representation allows for non - perturbative calculation of the free energy and the density - density correlation function for the tl model with the non - linear dispersion .",
    "we believe that these two results are new .",
    "when the bare electron dispersion is linear the quasiparticle representation could be used to determine the single - electron green s function .",
    "it coincides with the green s function obtained by other methods .",
    "the existence of the quasiparticles does not contradict to the fact that the single - electron green s function of tl model has no pole .",
    "the quasiparticles in tl model has zero overlap with the physical electrons : @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to think about tl model as @xmath2 fermi liquid @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we diagonalize the tl hamiltonian in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii we offer an intuitive explanation to the method . in this section",
    "all technical complications are disregarded in order to create an integral view .",
    "the density - density propagator is derived in sec .",
    "the single - particle green s function is calculated in sec . v. sec .",
    "vi is reserved for discussion .",
    "certain technical details can be found in appendices .",
    "the tl model hamiltonian is given by : @xmath3 the chirality label ` l ' corresponds to left - moving electrons , the label ` r ' corresponds to right - moving electrons .",
    "the interaction of the electrons of the same chirality is ignored since up to irrelevant operators such interaction simply renormalizes the value of the fermi velocity @xmath4 . the symbol @xmath5 denotes normal ordering of the field operators @xmath6 . a brief discussion of the normal ordering procedure we use in this paper is given in appendix a.    it is assumed that the cut - off of ( [ h ] ) is infinite .",
    "to remove ultraviolet divergences of the theory without cut - off we replace usual zero - range interaction ( @xmath7 ) by interaction acting over a finite range .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a broadened version of the delta - function : its fourier transform @xmath10 is such that @xmath11 for @xmath12 smaller than some quantity @xmath13 , and @xmath14 vanishes quickly for @xmath15 . the parameter @xmath13 thus defined regularizes ultraviolet divergences of our theory .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the following commutation relations are obeyed : @xmath16 = \\delta_{pp ' } \\delta_{qq ' } p n_q \\label{rho_comm}\\\\ \\left[\\rho_{pq}^{\\vphantom{\\dagger } } , \\psi^\\dagger_{p'}(x ) \\right ] = \\delta_{pp ' } { \\rm e}^{-iqx } \\psi^\\dagger_{p'}(x ) , \\label{psi_comm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 for left - moving electrons , @xmath18 for right - moving electrons and @xmath19 using this commutation relations we will show that the unitary operator @xmath20 diagonalizes the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) except for the zero mode part .",
    "fortunately , the zero modes @xmath21 are decoupled from other degrees of freedom .",
    "also , their contribution to the low - energy spectrum is @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath23 s are quadratic in @xmath6 the above operator @xmath0 is quartic in fermionic operators @xmath6 . in general , it is impossible to work with such a non - linear object . in our situation , however , the simplicity of commutation rules ( [ rho_comm ] ) and ( [ psi_comm ] ) allows us to diagonalize the hamiltonian with the help of @xmath0 .    in order to transform the interaction term ( [ int ] ) with the operator @xmath0 it is enough to observe that the action of @xmath0 on the density operator @xmath24 , @xmath25 , is a bogoliubov rotation :",
    "@xmath26 this result is a simple consequence of the commutation relation ( [ rho_comm ] ) .",
    "this identity can be derived by a variety of methods .",
    "for example , one can differentiate its left - hand side with respect to @xmath27 for both @xmath28 and @xmath29 and solve the resultant differential equation system .",
    "the easiest way to transform the kinetic energy term is to notice that the kinetic energy density can be expressed as a product of two density operators .",
    "the derivation goes as follows .",
    "first , we normal order the product of two density operators : @xmath30 as it is explained in appendix a the normal ordering is used here to isolate explicitly singular terms of the field operator products .",
    "now we expand the above identity into laurent series with respect to powers of @xmath31 : @xmath32 in this expansion an irrelevant operator can be recognized by a factor of @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "for example , the first term in ( [ rr ] ) is an irrelevant operator : @xmath35 indeed , by simple power counting one can verify that its scaling dimension is equal to @xmath36 . sending @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ laurent ] ) , we establish the identity : @xmath38 thus , it is permissible to write the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) in the form : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the fourier transform of @xmath41 . for convenience",
    "we explicitly show the zero mode part of the above expression : @xmath42 such splitting is useful since our transformation @xmath0 does not act on the zero modes .",
    "we now apply @xmath0 and choose parameters @xmath27 in such a way that the term @xmath43 vanishes : @xmath44 the transformed hamiltonian is : @xmath45 from now on we will ignore the zero mode contribution to the hamiltonian : the above formulas clearly show that it is small ( @xmath46 ) for a macroscopic system . ultimately , we have : @xmath47 this expression can be re - written in terms of fields @xmath6 .",
    "let us show how this is done in a technically trivial case of @xmath48 ( which is equivalent to @xmath49 ) .",
    "when @xmath13 is infinite the functions @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath40 are all constants independent of @xmath52 .",
    "their values are given by ( [ uv ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , hamiltonian ( [ hfin ] ) is equal to @xmath54 where @xmath55 is given by ( [ tilde_v ] ) . finally , inverting ( [ rhorho ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath56 these transformations , apart from minor differences , are equivalent to the refermionization as it is done in @xcite .    in certain situations ,",
    "however , it is convenient to have finite @xmath13 . then a subtler reasoning is required .",
    "it is possible to prove that : @xmath57 such proof is rather technical .",
    "it can be found in appendix b.    let us agree that operators with the tilde are transformations of corresponding operators without the tilde , that is @xmath58 . then the hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of operators @xmath59 as follows : @xmath60 the above equation is the desired mapping of tl model on the model of quasiparticles @xmath59 whose interactions are small irrelevant operators . due to the irrelevance of the interaction the low - energy properties of @xmath59",
    "are those of free fermions .    using the developed framework it is possible to discuss the effect of non - linear dispersion on the spectrum and correlations of ( [ h ] ) .",
    "we add an extra term to the tl hamiltonian : @xmath61 the subscript ` nl ' stands for ` non - linear ' dispersion .",
    "function @xmath62 which is the fourier transform of @xmath63 has these properties : @xmath64 the second of these two conditions guarantees that for @xmath65 the modified kinetic energy @xmath66 has the same sign as the original kinetic energy @xmath67 .",
    "that is , @xmath68 does not induce an instability of the ground state by creating spurious fermi point .    condition ( [ q=0 ] ) implies that for small @xmath69 it is permissible to use @xmath70 instead of ( [ h2 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath71 is the fermi velocity derivative with respect to the momentum .",
    "we need to express @xmath68 in terms of @xmath59 .",
    "to do so it is convenient to rewrite @xmath68 with the help of density operators @xmath72 rather than field operators @xmath73 .",
    "this trick was already used in ( [ rhorho ] ) .",

    "thus : @xmath75 - 2b_p ( x - y ) \\rho_p(y ) \\right\\}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we have to substitute @xmath76 for @xmath25 in the above expression .",
    "the resultant third order polynomial of @xmath77 s must be rewritten in terms of @xmath78 with the help of ( [ rr ] ) and ( [ rho3 ] ) .",
    "the final expression for @xmath68 is : @xmath79 the details of the derivation together with the exact formulas for coefficients @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 can be found in appendix c. here we quote only the expressions which are valid if the interaction parameter @xmath83 is small .",
    "let us define @xmath84 as @xmath85 .",
    "when interaction is small ( @xmath86 ) the coefficients are : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a non - universal constant of order unity .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath89 is the sum of @xmath90 , eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) , and @xmath68 . due to @xmath68",
    "the quasiparticle dispersion becomes non - linear ( the first term of ( [ nlq ] ) ) .",
    "also , @xmath68 introduces additional interactions between the quasiparticles .",
    "the operators corresponding to these interaction ( the second term in ( [ nlq ] ) ) are @xmath91 and irrelevant .",
    "therefore , they can be neglected provided that @xmath92 the quasiparticles remain free even if the bare dispersion is not linear as long as the bare interaction is sufficiently small .",
    "note , that the free boson representation for tl model is much less tolerant of @xmath68 .",
    "this term is equivalent to cubic interaction between bosons ( see ( [ rho3 ] ) and ref.@xcite ) . for the bosons to remain free",
    "a stricter condition @xmath93 has to be satisfied .",
    "equations ( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ nlq ] ) allow us to describe the thermodynamics of the electronic liquid with the generic dispersion .",
    "for example , the free energy equals to @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the dispersion of the quasiparticles .",
    "this result is non - perturbative in @xmath96 .",
    "corrections to the free energy due to the neglected quasiparticle interaction are @xmath97 .",
    "thus , our result for @xmath98 is accurate provided that ( [ free ] ) holds true .",
    "the specific heat at constant chemical potential can be derived from ( [ free_en ] ) in the limit of low temperature ( @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 we observe that non - zero dispersion curvature generates @xmath101 contribution to the specific heat .",
    "( note : irrelevant operators neglected along the way also contribute to the specific heat .",
    "however , their contribution is @xmath102 and @xmath103 . for small @xmath83 such corrections can be disregarded . )",
    "the same result for the specific heat could be obtained with the help of bosonization technique . there",
    "one must expand the free energy in orders of @xmath68 .",
    "these calculations are done in appendix d. they provide an important consistency check for the proposed approach .",
    "we have finished the introduction of our method and ready to apply it to green s function calculations . at this point",
    "we would like to make a break between two rather technical parts and explain why the method works on intuitive level .",
    "the central issue of this discussion could be loosely formulated as follows : why the strongly interacting bosons could be mapped on the weakly interacting fermions , what kind of ` cancellation ' of interactions takes place ? to answer this question we direct our attention to most essential aspects of the approach .",
    "all technical complications will be disregarded : we will ignore zero modes , normal ordering and assume that @xmath104 .",
    "this makes the following presentation more transparent .",
    "let us start with the bosonized form of the tl hamiltonian , familiar to many researchers @xcite : @xmath105 where boson fields @xmath106 and @xmath107 are connected to the density operators in the usual way : @xmath108 tomonaga - luttinger liquid parameter @xmath109 is defined below . for the purpose of this section",
    "it is enough to remember that for small @xmath83 parameter @xmath109 is close to unity : @xmath110 as we see from ( [ hnl_bos ] ) , the boson interaction is proportional to @xmath111 .",
    "now we perform the bogoliubov transformation : @xmath112 our hamiltonian becomes : @xmath113 we rewrite it as follows : @xmath114 we split the above hamiltonian into two part for a reason .",
    "the first part @xmath115 becomes a free quasiparticle hamiltonian upon refermionization .",
    "indeed , the first term in the curly brackets of ( [ hfree ] ) refermionizes to become the kinetic energy of the fermions with linear dispersion , the second term of ( [ hfree ] ) becomes @xmath116-correction to the linear dispersion .",
    "refermionized hamiltonian @xmath117 contains all the quasiparticle interaction .",
    "it also contains terms quadratic in @xmath78 which renormalize the value of @xmath118 .",
    "the important point , however , is that @xmath117 is small if @xmath83 is small : @xmath119 this can be established by observing that @xmath117 vanishes when @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 .",
    "note also , that @xmath117 is small if ( [ free ] ) is satisfied .",
    "power counting shows that @xmath117 is irrelevant .",
    "smallness and irrelevance of the quasiparticle interaction implies that the quasiparticles could be viewed as weakly interacting .",
    "we could look at our method from a different prospective .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath123 in addition to a quadratic ( in @xmath6 ) part @xmath124 has small marginal operator @xmath125 .",
    "plus , it has an irrelevant operator @xmath68 which we want to account for non - perturbatively .",
    "since perturbation theory in the marginal operator diverges , we must either sum certain diagrams to all orders or , as it is done in the theory of superconductivity , perform a bogoliubov transformation which kills the undesirable marginal operator .",
    "this is what our transformation @xmath0 does : @xmath126 is quadratic in fermionic fields .",
    "operator @xmath68 is quadratic in @xmath6 . in general , however , operator @xmath127 does not have to be quadratic .",
    "thus , after the removal of the marginal operator by the bogoliubov transformation , new interactions between the quasiparticles are generated .",
    "fortunately , they are irrelevant and small .",
    "the smallness of the generated interactions becomes obvious if we observe that for small @xmath83 transformation @xmath0 is close to the identity transformation : @xmath128 .",
    "thus , the quasiparticle interaction induced by the action of @xmath0 on @xmath68 could be treated perturbatively .",
    "this is the core of the approach we proposed in the previous section .",
    "in this section we will calculate density - density green s function .",
    "the derivation of the correlation function for the total density operator @xmath129 is quite simple if we note that @xmath23 is proportional to the quasiparticle density operator : @xmath130 . using this identity",
    "one obtains for small @xmath12 : @xmath131 the chiral green s function @xmath132 will be calculated below to the zeroth order in the quasiparticle interaction constant @xmath81 . unlike expansion in orders of @xmath83",
    "the perturbative expansion in orders of @xmath81 is a well - defined procedure : as we explained , the quasiparticle - quasiparticle interaction is irrelevant . with accuracy @xmath133",
    "the propagator @xmath134 can be expressed as a convolution of two single - quasiparticle propagators : @xmath135 in eq .",
    "( [ dp ] ) @xmath136 is fermi distribution function .",
    "thus , at @xmath137 : @xmath138 this result has the accuracy of @xmath97 , as explained above .",
    "the omitted corrections are due to the quasiparticle interaction @xmath81 . at the same time , the above expression for @xmath139 is accurate to all orders in the dispersion curvature @xmath80 .",
    "the retarded propagator @xmath140 is obtained by the analytical continuation : @xmath141 for vanishing @xmath80 we can write for the green s function the following expansion : @xmath142 the first term coincides with the well - known bosonization result @xcite . the second term could be also found within the bosonization approach : one has to develop a perturbation theory expansion in powers of @xmath80 .",
    "how this could be done is shown in appendix e. these calculations serve as yet another consistency check for our method .",
    "one can make another interesting observation when examining ( [ d_exp ] ) . by looking at this expansion",
    "it is impossible to guess that the propagator ( [ dret ] ) has a branch - cut , not a pole . to determine the correct complex structure the non - perturbative in @xmath111 calculations are required .",
    "such complex structure of the propagator indicates that there is no coherently propagating bosonic mode @xcite .",
    "instead , we have a continuum of quasiparticle - quasihole pair excitations .",
    "it is possible to visualize this continuum by calculating the spectral function @xmath143 : @xmath144 ( note : unlike single - fermion spectral function @xmath143 does not have to be positive . )",
    "every point of @xmath145 plane where @xmath146 corresponds to a quasiparticle - quasihole excitation with total energy @xmath147 and total momentum @xmath52 .",
    "the set of these points is shown on fig.2 .",
    "a previous attempt to account for non - zero @xmath111 has been made in @xcite .",
    "however , the bosonic representation used in the latter references is not very convenient for such a task . to illustrate the nature of the problem we consider a case of free electrons ( @xmath148 ) with strongly non - linear dispersion @xmath149 :",
    "@xmath150 the quasiparticle representation is trivial : @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "the spectrum of ( [ free_f ] ) is @xmath153 density - density correlation function is given by ( [ df ] ) . in the bosonization framework operator",
    "@xmath68 corresponds to cubic interaction between bosons with the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath154 of order unity ( see ( [ hnl_bos ] ) ) . to compute either spectrum or green s functions one must resort to the perturbation theory",
    "whose accuracy , however , is not obvious due to lack of small parameter .",
    "if in addition to @xmath111 we have @xmath155 then the bogoliubov rotation of the tl bosons is required .",
    "when the bogoliubov transformation acts on @xmath68 it generates extra interaction terms of the form @xmath156 .",
    "the coupling constant for this kind of interaction is of the order of @xmath157 .",
    "thus , in the bosonic representation one has to deal with two kinds of interaction terms and two coupling constants one of which is of the order of unity .    as we have seen in section iii , if we add weak electron - electron interaction @xmath125 ( eq.([int ] ) ) to @xmath115 ( eq.([free_f ] ) ) the quasiparticle representation evolves continuously with @xmath83 : @xmath158 , @xmath159 .",
    "non - zero @xmath83 generates interaction between the quasiparticles . yet , this interaction remains small ( if ( [ free ] ) is fulfilled ) and irrelevant .",
    "consequently , the green s function is given by ( [ df ] ) with renormalized @xmath4 and @xmath111 , the spectrum of the interacting hamiltonian has the form ( [ e ] ) .",
    "in short , the advantage of the quasiparticle representation steams from its ability to account for @xmath111 non - perturbatively .",
    "now we will show how to calculate the single - electron green s function . at present",
    "we can find the green s function for the case of @xmath160 only .",
    "although , this green s function has been evaluated before by a number of approaches we would like to include this derivation to demonstrate different aspects of the method .    in order to calculate the single - electron green s function",
    "it is necessary to know how to express the electron field operator @xmath161 in terms of the quasiparticle operators @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the following derivation answers this question .",
    "we begin by introducing unitary operator @xmath164 where @xmath165 let us calculate the commutator of this operator with @xmath24 : @xmath166 = \\left ( { \\rm e}^{\\varphi_p(x ) } \\rho_{pq } { \\rm e}^{-\\varphi_p(x ) } - \\rho_{pq } \\right ) { \\rm e}^{\\varphi_p(x)}.\\ ] ] the first term in brackets can be calculated easily : @xmath167 = \\rho_{pq } + \\beta_{p - q } p { \\rm e}^{-iqx}.\\ ] ] thus , the formula for the commutator is : @xmath168 = p\\beta_{p - q } { \\rm e}^{-iqx } { \\rm e}^{\\varphi_p}.\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath169 the product @xmath170 commute with @xmath171 for any @xmath172 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , it commutes with @xmath173 , eq.([omega ] ) .",
    "this means that such product is invariant under the action of @xmath0 .",
    "the action of @xmath0 on the field operator is given by : @xmath174 = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter formula is easy to invert : @xmath175 = 0,\\\\ w_q = u_q - 1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it gives us the desired equation for @xmath161 in terms of @xmath176 and @xmath77 .",
    "let us calculate the correlation function : @xmath177 the simplest way to evaluate this expression is to transform it in the following manner .",
    "the density operators with @xmath178 must be shifted to the left ( right ) end , the quasiparticle field operators stay in the middle .",
    "the reason for such choice is that @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath181 for @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the ground state of ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the details of this derivation are given in appendix f. the result is @xmath184 where we used the notation @xmath185 .",
    "the same formula is derived using bosonization @xcite .",
    "it is well - known fact that the above green s function does not have pole .",
    "this means that the quasiparticle state has zero overlap with the physical electron state .",
    "in this paper we solve the tl model with the help of the unitary transformation .",
    "the transformation maps the original hamiltonian on the hamiltonian of weakly interacting quasiparticles .",
    "our approach easily incorporates deviation of the electron dispersion from the linear form .",
    "as long as the bare interaction constant is sufficiently small two new non - perturbative results ( eq .",
    "( [ free_en ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ df ] ) ) can be derived .",
    "the derived results accounts for the curvature parameter @xmath80 to all orders ; they contain errors of order @xmath186 due to neglected interaction among the quasiparticles .",
    "the ability of our method to account for @xmath80 to all orders allows us to resolve the complex structure of the density - density propagator .    in principle",
    ", our diagonalization technique is not the only way to derive the quasiparticle representation .",
    "it is possible ( fig.1 ) to bosonize ( [ h ] ) then perform the bogoliubov transformation and then fermionize the diagonal bosonic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can construct non - fermionic excitations using appropriate exponents of bosonic operators @xcite . in our case use of bosonization",
    "looks like an unnecessary detour .    to conclude , we propose a unitary transformation which maps tl model on a model of free fermions .",
    "such approach reproduces or generalizes the tl correlation functions calculated using bosonization .",

    "the author would like to thank the referees who suggested writing appendices d and e.    support of the  dynasty \" foundation of dmitri zimin is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in order to differentiate products of field operators one must perform normal ordering of the product under consideration .",
    "the subject of this appendix is the definition of the normal ordering procedure we use in this paper .",
    "most commonly a normal ordered product of two or more field operators is defined with the reference to some non - interacting ground state @xmath187 .",
    "for example , for product of two operators such definition reads : @xmath188 the ground state is not specified in this equation .",
    "thus , we actually have infinite number of normal ordering procedures , each corresponding to a particular state @xmath187 .",
    "usually , the problem at hand dictates the choice of this state .",
    "normal ordered product ( [ nord ] ) possesses two properties : ( i ) it is well - defined and analytical at @xmath189 ; ( ii ) its ground state expectation value is zero .",
    "since the ground state of the tomonaga - luttinger hamiltonian can not be approximated by a ground state of non - interacting physical fermions @xmath6 tl ground state can not be used in ( [ nord ] ) .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to explain what state we use in our definition of the normal order .    in the bosonization framework",
    "it is customary @xcite to normal order with respect to the the ground state of the hamiltonian : @xmath190 we accept this definition in our work as well .",
    "thus , for a product of two field operators we have : @xmath191 where @xmath192 is equal to @xmath193 . in this equation",
    "the pole of @xmath194 at @xmath189 is explicitly shown .",
    "the normal ordered product is well - behaved at @xmath189 and it satisfies the property ( i ) , formulated above .",
    "it is not a miracle that property ( i ) remains intact despite the fact that the ground states of ( [ h ] ) and ( [ hk0 ] ) are drastically different .",
    "note that ( i ) is ` ultraviolet ' in its nature  it refers to short distance ( @xmath195 ) , high energy ( @xmath196 ) behavior of the operator product .",
    "since interaction ( [ int ] ) is limited in @xmath52-space high - energy structure of the tl ground state is the same as that of ( [ hk0 ] ) .",
    "this guarantees that ( i ) is satisfied .",
    "yet , the tl ground state expectation value of ( [ nord ] ) for generic values of @xmath197 and @xmath198 is not zero .",
    "that is , property ( ii ) is violated .",
    "fortunately , we never need it in this paper .",
    "the normal ordered product of four field operators is defined by the equation : @xmath199 as above , the normal ordered product can be differentiated everywhere .    for completeness ,",

    "it is tempting to equate @xmath235 and @xmath247 this , however , is not exactly accurate since the normal ordering and bogoliubov transformation do not ` commute ' with each other .",

    "in particular : @xmath255 observe that the normal ordered product of @xmath23 s differs from the normal ordered product of @xmath77 s by a non - singular operator .    generalizing the above calculations for the product of three @xmath23 s we obtain the following expression for @xmath235 : @xmath256 where ` z.m .

    "then , @xmath257 , @xmath258 and it is possible to write : @xmath259 when handling the third and the fourth terms of ( [ hnl3 ] ) we are to act in the similar fashion : the product @xmath260 should be rewritten in terms of @xmath78 with the help of ( [ rhorho ] ) .",
    "these two terms give the quasiparticle interaction .    for a finite value of @xmath13 our task",
    "becomes somewhat more complicated .",

    "our first step is to rewrite the non - linear dispersion hamiltonian @xmath271 in a form particularly suitable for @xmath202 calculations : since in this appendix we work at finite temperature it is natural to express @xmath68 with the help of the finite temperature generalization of ( [ nrho2 ] ) and ( [ nrho3 ] ) .",

    "( [ bpt ] ) , instead of @xmath279 , eq.([bp ] ) .",
    "using the new rules of the normal ordering we could prove that at @xmath280 the following is true : @xmath281 where @xmath282 denotes here the finite temperature normal order .",

    "the symbol @xmath286 denotes the finite @xmath206 generalization of the normal ordering , consequently , the expression @xmath287 varies with temperature .",
    "the @xmath288 term compensates the temperature dependence of the normal ordered product @xmath287 so that @xmath68 is temperature independent as it must be .",
    "we remind the reader that such a way of writing is a matter of convenience .    in the above expression",
    "we ignore the quasiparticle interaction and the correction to the chemical potential since we are interested in @xmath289 corrections only while the neglected terms contribute to the thermodynamics at @xmath97 .",
    "the correction to the free energy due to @xmath68 is given by the usual perturbation theory formula : @xmath290 using wick s theorem we find : @xmath291 therefore : @xmath292 it is easy to calculate the integral @xmath293 for @xmath294 .",
    "to find the integral of @xmath295 we use a trick .",
    "one can check directly that : @xmath296 the integral of the full derivative is zero and we establish for @xmath294 @xmath297 therefore , one finds the following corrections to the free energy , the entropy and the specific heat : @xmath298 the last expression coincides with the second term of eq.([c(t ) ] ) as it should be .",
    "in this appendix we calculate @xmath276 correction to the zero - temperature boson propagator .",
    "such correction must coincide with the second term of ( [ d_exp ] ) .",
    "the correction in question to the chiral matsubara propagator comes from @xmath68 , eq.([hnlt ] ) , with @xmath137 .",
    "the appropriate feynman diagram is shown on fig.3 .",
    "as one can see from eq.([d ] ) the corresponding expression is : @xmath299 the time - ordered average with respect to hamiltonian ( [ hbos0 ] ) is equal to : @xmath300 where @xmath301 is the chiral free boson green s function @xmath302 for hamiltonian ( [ hbos0 ] ) .",
    "the numerical factor on the right - hand side of ( [ loop ] ) corresponds to 36 possible ways of contracting the density operators into a connected diagram presented on fig.3 .",
    "first , the external operator @xmath303 could contract with either of two vertexes ; the operator @xmath304 contracts with the remaining vertex .",
    "this gives a factor of two .",
    "second , a given external operator could contract with either of three density operators in a vertex .",
    "this gives a factor of three for one external operator and another factor of three for the second external operator .",
    "finally , after contracting with the external operators , every vertex has two uncontracted density operators . for them",
    "there are two ways of contraction .",
    "thus , we have yet another factor of two .    in the fourier space we can write : @xmath305 therefore , for correction to the full propagator we write : @xmath306 after analytical continuation we recover the @xmath276 term of ( [ d_exp ] ) .",
    "in this appendix we provide a detailed derivation of the single - electron green s function for tl model , equation ( [ g ] ) .",

    "we want to argue that any interaction term @xmath326 , @xmath327 does not lead to ultraviolet divergence of perturbation theory .",

    "thus , @xmath334 terms do not contribute to the second order ground state correction .",
    "they do , however , contribute to higher order corrections and to corrections to different propagators .",

    "we will show that the matrix element goes to zero if at least one @xmath335 or @xmath336 exceeds @xmath337 .",
    "let us examine definitions of @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "since @xmath51 and @xmath340 vanishes for @xmath341 every individual operator @xmath342 changes the total momentum by no more than @xmath13 .",
    "thus , momentum change produced by @xmath343 is no more than @xmath344 .",
    "we will use this information in our next step .",
    "first step in evaluating the matrix element from ( [ 2-corr ] ) is creation of a quasiparticle - quasihole pair by applying @xmath345 product to @xmath183 .",
    "since the total momentum of all excitations is zero the momentum of this pair cancels the momentum of @xmath343 .",
    "thus , the pair momentum magnitude is limited by @xmath346 .",
    "two elementary excitations , quasiparticle and quasihole , of which the pair is composed have their momenta bound by @xmath347 .",
    "as we explained above , by acting on the ground state the product @xmath348 creates an excited state with a quasiparticle and a quasihole . on this state",

    "both newly created elementary excitations have their momenta bound by @xmath13 .",
