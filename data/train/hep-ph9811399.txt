    "1h and 1i ) .",
    "this will result in a further higher order correction to the quark - quark scattering process .",
    "it is clear , however , that the manifest gauge dependence of the resummed one - loop contribution will be unaffected by the presence of other virtual gluons ( ` dressed ' or not ) in the diagram .",
    "every virtual gluon has only two ends , and so the resummed vertex correction is at most quadratic .",
    "then no cancellation is possible of the gauge dependent pieces of multiple vacuum polarisation insertions .",

    "the solution for @xmath109 , eq .",
    "( 4.9 ) , is independent of @xmath121 .",
    "thus for fixed values of @xmath107 , @xmath2 , @xmath24 , @xmath116 , satisfying the conditions ( 4.10 ) or ( 4.11 ) there are , in general , two values of @xmath109 such that eq .",

    "in the original derivations of the ` asymptotic freedom ' property of qcd  @xcite no calculations were performed beyond the lowest non - trivial order , @xmath11 , and no actual amplitudes for physical processes were considered .",
    "it was conjectured ( without any check by direct diagrammatic calculation ) that the qcd running coupling constant ( rcc ) could , in general ( for any choice of gauge ) be identified with the solution of the differential equation ( 2.8 ) .",
    "the one - loop qcd beta function was calculated by considering the callan - symanzik  @xcite equation for an irreducible @xmath138-point function ( typically the gluon - quark - quark vertex or the triple gluon vertex ) .",
    "calculation of the anomalous dimensions of the quark and gluon fields then yields the ( gauge invariant ) expression for the first beta function coefficient @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( 2.8 ) above . an analogous result is obtained above by considering the unresummed one - loop correction to the physical quark - quark scattering amplitude .",
    "the true high order behaviour , however , corresponds to the sum of _ all _ the possible amplitudes for the process of interest . for this the actual topographical structure of the diagrams contributing to the amplitude",
    "must be properly taken into account .",
    "renormalisation scale invariance of the rcc , and the asymptotic freedom property , for an arbitary choice of covariant gauge , are not confirmed by the diagrammatic calculation of higher order corrections in the case of the quark - quark scattering amplitude considered in this paper .",
    "gauge dependence of the rcc in qcd has been considered previously in the literature , but usually as an effect only at the two - loop level and at higher orders .",
    "it was pointed out that , in the case when the bare parameters of the theory are held fixed , the gauge parameter becomes scale dependent , and for certain momentum subtraction renormalisation schemes , the second coefficient of the beta function is both scheme and gauge dependent  @xcite . for an arbitary covariant gauge specified by the fixed parameter @xmath34 , as in the one - loop discussion above , the second beta function coefficient is , however , both gauge and renormalisation scheme invariant . assuming that the rcc , mass and gauge parameter each satisfy renormalisation group equations similar to ( 2.8 ) , and solving the coupled system of differential equations , solutions were found for the rcc that strongly depended on the initial conditions imposed on the running gauge parameter  @xcite .",
    "these solutions exhibit either asymptotic freedom - like behaviour or increase with increasing scale until an ultraviolet fixed point is reached  @xcite .",
    "as commonly done in the literature , the rcc was treated as an independent mathematical object , without reference to any actual physical process , and the renormalisation group equations were assumed to hold without specific diagrammatic justification .",
    "it is shown above that , if the rcc is identified with the effective charge of the quark - quark scattering amplitude , the one - loop renormalisation group equation holds only for the specific gauge choice @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge parameter can then neither vary nor satisfy a rge .",
    "when quark mass effects are taken into account , the one - loop beta function coefficient is also gauge dependent , and has a value which depends on the particular @xmath138-point green s function considered for its derivation .",
    "the mass dependent corrections to the triple gluon vertex  @xcite and the gluon - ghost - ghost vertex  @xcite are different .",
    "a detailed discussion may be found in ref .",
    "a corollary is that the rcc in physical amplitudes is both gauge and process dependent at physical scales where quark mass effects ( other than those contained in the asymptotically dominant logarithmic terms ) are important .    the effective charge ( 3.7 ) has been calculated here for the simple case of quark - quark scattering with a unique physical scale @xmath139 . in this case",
    "the direct physical interpretation as the strength of the interaction between two currents varying as a function of their separation ( @xmath140 ) is particularly transparent .",
    "however , since every dressed propagator has just two ends , similar expressions for the rcc ( in general a function of some running loop 4-momentum @xmath141 ) are expected in all physical amplitudes containing virtual gluon lines .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "4a shows the three topographically distinct classes of diagrams that contribute to the anomalous magnetic moment of a heavy quark at @xmath7 . in fig .",
    "4b the same classes of diagrams are shown for the four - loop photon proper self energy function due to radiatively corrected quark vacuum polarisation loops . as for the quark - quark scattering case the same topographical structures ( giving at most a quadratic dependence on the vertex corrections )",
    "is found at all higher orders in the ` dressed gluon propagator ' .",
    "the diagrams of fig .",
    "4b are related via the optical theorem and analytical continuation to the process : @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes @xmath144 , @xmath145 or @xmath146 .",
    "there has been considerable recent interest in the structure , in high orders of perturbation theory , of diagrams containing chains of vacuum polarisation loops in internal gluon propagators ( for example the generalisation to higher orders of the @xmath7 diagrams with two vacuum polarisation loops shown in fig .  4 ) .",
    "the anstatz used for these so - called ` renormalon chains '  @xcite is to replace @xmath147 in a calculation considering only @xmath26 different flavours of fermion vacuum polarisation loops with @xmath148 .",
    "this is clearly a good approximation in the limit @xmath149 . as inspection of fig .",
    "4 shows , however , this will result , in any gauge in which the vertex correction is non - vanishing , in a miscounting of the contribution of the latter , which are included at order @xmath138 in terms of the form @xmath150 , but actually should never appear at higher order than quadratic in the perturbation series . with",
    "however the gauge choice @xmath1 ( loop gauge ) all vertex corrections vanish and the renormalon chains are correctly given by the above replacement .",
    "this gauge choice is , in any case , the one universally ( although tacitly ) made in all phenomenological applications of the qcd running coupling constant , where renormalisation group invariance is assumed .",
    "thus the ` naive non - abelianization ' ( nna ) ansatz  @xcite or ` large @xmath22 limit ' that is typically assumed in phenomenological studies of renormalon effects is a correct one only in loop gauge .",
    "the remark that the choice of gauge @xmath1 implies the vanishing of all vertex corrections , has previously been made in the context of two - loop corrections to heavy quark production in @xmath151 annihilation  @xcite .",
    "an instructive example of the inconsistent treatment of feynman diagrams by the nna anstatz as well as a illustration of the gauge dependence of fixed order perturbative qcd calculations beyond next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) is provided by the analysis of the moments of non - singlet anomalous dimensions of deep - inelastic nucleon structure functions in ref .",

    "although the renormalon singularities are related to singular ir or uv behaviour of the running coupling constant as discussed by lautrup in ref .",
    "@xcite , in qed it is the uv landau singularity the renormalon singularity occurs for arbitary values of the external physical scale due to the infinite range of the internal loop momentum . in contrast , in the simple case of quark - quark scattering discussed in the present paper , there is no integration over the virtuality of the gluon line in which the vertex and loop corrections are inserted and the scale in the running coupling constant is identical to the physical scale of the problem . the diagramatic analysis shown in fig .",
    "2 is therefore much simpler and the breakdown of gauge invariance appears as soon as the nnlo contributions of fig .",
    "2b are evaluated .",
    "the classification of diagrams as in figs .  2 , 4 and 5 , according to the categories ( in an obvious notation ) @xmath164 , will remain when @xmath50 , @xmath49 are calculated with an arbitary number of internal lines .",
    "the global structure of eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) will then remain the same for calculations including an arbitary number of loops , though additional non - leading terms in @xmath3 will result from integration over internal loops in the basic one - loop vacuum polarisation and vertex diagrams shown in fig .  1 .",
    "as in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , only the leading logarithmic terms in the one - loop correction ( and hence in the resummed effective charge ) have been taken into account in the above discussion .",
    "constant terms in @xmath49 and @xmath50 have been neglected . for a general renormalisation scheme",
    "however , constant gauge and renormalisation scheme dependent terms also occur , so that eq .",

    "thus , in the @xmath172 scheme in loop gauge , the resummed one - loop invariant charge is only asymptotically a renormalisation group invariant when constant terms in the one - loop correction are retained .    following the observation that the uv divergent parts of the vertex corrections in figs .",

( 3.3 ) ) as : @xmath176 expressing @xmath177 in terms of the gauge invariant quantity @xmath178 and the gauge dependent quantity @xmath179 gives : @xmath180 which is manifestly gauge dependent .",
    "the dyson sum in eq .",
    "( 2.19 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite correctly describes the all orders resummed amplitude , not for an arbitary gauge parameter @xmath34 , but only for the special choice @xmath137 when @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 clearly , the above argument for manifest gauge dependence , shown to be valid at the resummed one - loop level must also hold at arbitary loop order if the vertex and self - energy insertions satisfy a generalised ward identity giving , at each order of perturbation theory , a condition such as ( 5.3 ) .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite , by the application of background field techniques , that ward identities relating vertex and self - energy contributions may indeed be derived that are valid to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the gauge independence of the ward identity at each fixed order then necessarily implies gauge dependence when the corresponding vertex and self - energy diagrams are resummed .",
    "the manifest gauge dependence of the quark - quark scattering amplitude found , by direct calculation , in this paper , is , apparently , in contradiction with formal proofs  @xcite of the gauge invariance of @xmath184matrix elements in non - abelian gauge theories .",
    "it seems however , that what is actually proved in these papers is the gauge invariance , at all orders in perturbation theory , of generalised ward identities .",
    "the consequences of _ resumming _ diagrams of fixed loop order , which as shown above , necessarily generates gauge dependence , were not considered .",
    "for example , in the standard reference  @xcite , the lagrangian from which all the feynman rules of the theory is derived is introduced , and the change in this lagrangian due to a change in the gauge parameter written down .",
    "it is then stated that the theory is gauge invariant if such a variation of the gauge parameter leaves @xmath184matrix elements invariant . there",
    "immediately follows the statement : ` we can formulate this condition ' ( i.e that the @xmath184matrix elements are invariant ) ` in terms of a ward identity that we have written in terms of the diagrams in fig .  2 ' .",
    "the unproved and unjustified assertion is thus made that the gauge invariance of a ward identity is equivalent to gauge invariance of @xmath184matrix elements .",
    "this will only be true of unresummed amplitudes at each loop order , not of the resummed amplitudes that , according to quantum mechanical superposition , must exist and are , indeed , essential to generate the rcc .",
    "in fact ref .",
    "@xcite establishes _ only _ the gauge invariance of ward identities , and nothing else . as shown above , it is just the gauge invariance of the unresummed amplitudes that ensure the manifest gauge dependence of the resummed ones .",
    "indeed an @xmath184matrix element ( even a formal , generic , one ) appears nowhere among the equations of ref .  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite such a formal @xmath184matrix element does appear , but its gauge invariance properties are derived directly from a ward identity .",
    "no actual physical process , and no effect of resummation , is considered .    by consideration of a sub - set of @xmath138-loop diagrams for the off - shell gluon - gluon scattering amplitude in a non - covariant gauge ,",
    "it has been claimed  @xcite to demonstrate that the rcc of qcd is both gauge invariant and process independent , and that it may be identified with the solution ( 2.10 ) of the rge ( 2.8 ) .",
    "the @xmath138-loop diagrams considered are those that may be constructed as a formal ` product ' of @xmath185 tree level four - point functions .",
    "the diagrams contain both resummed one - loop gluon vacuum polarisation and vertex diagrams and a sub set of irreducible @xmath138-loop diagrams .",
    "this set of diagrams can not , as claimed , be identified with the one - loop rcc in eq .",
    "( 2.10 ) , which results solely from the resummation of one - loop ( one particle irreducible ) diagrams . at any order in the perturbation",
    "series these resummed one - loop diagrams contribute the leading powers of both @xmath3 and @xmath26 .",
    "they give , in fact , the ` renormalon ' contribution  @xcite ( see above ) that dominates the high order behaviour of the perturbation series .",
    "the irreducible @xmath138-loop ( @xmath186 ) diagrams of the sub - set considered in ref  @xcite will contribute constant terms or non - leading powers of @xmath3 , and therefore can not be identified with terms in the diagrammatic expansion of the rcc in ( 2.10 ) . similarly , it has been conjectured ( without explicit calculation ) in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ` missing ' vertex contributions needed to make , say , @xmath187 in eq .",
    "( 5.5 ) above , gauge invariant may be derived from ` pinch parts ' of two - loop irreducible diagrams .",
    "this is not possible since the required ` missing ' contributions contain the factor @xmath188 , ( see eq .",
    "( 3.5 ) , whereas , as is well known , in both qed  @xcite and qcd  @xcite irreducible two - loop vacuum polarisation and vertex diagrams have , at most , next - to - leading logarithmic behaviour @xmath189 .",
    "this is easily demonstrated by considering the two - loop solution of the renormalisation group equation for the effective charge . in qed , or in qcd in the @xmath1 gauge , eq .",
    "( 4.2 ) generalises to : @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the second @xmath38-function coefficient . expanding the right side of eq .",
    "( 5.7 ) up to @xmath192 yields : @xmath193.\\ ] ] it can be seen that @xmath191 , given by two particle irreducible vacuum polarisation or vertex diagrams , occurs only in sub - leading logarithmic terms of the form @xmath194 .",
    "no possible re - arrangement of these terms can compensate the manifest gauge dependence of the leading - logarithmic terms of the form @xmath195 .",
    "the property exhibited above , for qcd , of gauge dependence of amplitudes on resumming one - loop corrections that , at lowest order , are gauge invariant , is expected to be a general property of non - abelian gauge theories . in such theories",
    "the gauge boson propagator , in an arbitary covariant gauge is written as  @xcite : @xmath196 , \\ ] ] where @xmath197 is the renormalised gauge boson mass .",
    "the topographical structure of diagrams contributing to , say , neutrino - neutrino scattering via @xmath198 exchange is the same as that for quark - quark scattering shown in fig .  1 . the one - loop vertex correction containing the non - abelian @xmath199 coupling is gauge dependent  @xcite . since the gauge dependence cancels at lowest order ( without resummation ) then , just as for qcd",
    ", it can not cancel at any higher order in the resummed one - loop amplitude .",
    "indeed a similar conclusion as to the necessity of the @xmath1 gauge in order to obtain an effective charge that satisfies a rge , reached in this paper for qcd , has previously been obtained , for the case of the weinberg - salam model , by baulieu and coqueraux  @xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that , with the special gauge choice ( in the notation of the present paper ) @xmath1 , the renormalisation constant of the @xmath200 mixing term vanishes , so that , in this case , effective charges satisfying separate ( decoupled ) rge s may be associated the one - loop resummed photon and @xmath198-boson propagators .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath1 is the unique choice of covariant gauge for which the photon mass counterterms in the renormalised lagrangian vanish .",
    "the case of @xmath201 exchange was not considered , but ( as may be seen by inspection of the relevant formulae given , in an arbitary covariant gauge , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the choice @xmath1 results in the vanishing of the renormalisation constants associated with the one - loop vertex corrections to both the @xmath198 and @xmath201 exchange fermion - fermion scattering amplitudes . as for the qcd case considered in the present paper ,",
    "it is then expected that , only for this special choice of gauge , an effective charge satisfying a rge may be associated with the resummed @xmath201 propagator .",
    "the pinch technique , and similar methods to formally shift gauge dependent pieces between diagrams , have also been applied to electroweak amplitudes  [ 40,46 - 49 ] .",
    "although gauge invariant boson proper self energy functions may be defined at one - loop level , any resummed higher order amplitude is demonstrably gauge dependent , by the same argument as that given above for qcd .",
    "so , although for a particular choice of gauge parameter ( such that the sum of all vertex corrections vanish ) resummed @xmath201 and @xmath198 running propagators may be defined that satisfy a rge , they can not , contrary to the claim of refs .",
    "[ 40,46 - 49 ] , be so defined in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "the diagrammatic inconsistency of these procedures is made manifest by the inclusion in the modified vector boson self energy function of box diagram contributions . if the effective charge is expanded as a perturbation series , the box diagram contributions at each order will give terms of a geometric series .",
    "there is no way that such a series can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of a sum of such diagrams required by quantum mechanical superposition .",
    "in fact , the contributions to physical amplitudes of box diagrams can be systematically resummed  @xcite , but the result found is typically the exponential of a double logarithm of the relevant physical scale , not the sum of a geometric series .",
    "for the case of the fermion - fermion scattering amplitude the contribution of box diagrams is expected to be important only in the @xmath202 limit and to vanish  @xcite in the @xmath203 limit .",
    "a discussion of the gauge dependence , beyond one - loop order , of the resonant @xmath198 boson amplitude , may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the limited convergence domain imposed by requiring finiteness of the geometric series , which occurs in all theories in which the rcc decreases with increasing scales ,",
    "can be avoided by choosing a very high renormalisation scale .",
    "this is equivalent , for such theories , to the choice , in qed , of on - shell renormalisation , yielding a rcc that is convergent for all scales below the landau scale  @xcite .",
    "although such a choice guarantees convergence for all physical scales below the the chosen renormalisation point , it appears artificial from a physical viewpoint . if a strong interaction process at , say , the scale of the mass of the charm quark is to be described using a renormalisation point at the gut scale @xmath204 , the formula for the rcc at scale @xmath205 will depend upon the masses of all strongly interacting elementary particles below @xmath204 and above @xmath205 .",
    "there will be a phenomenon of ` inverse decoupling ' whereby the lower the scale the more high mass particles must be taken into account .",
    "feynman amplitudes using such a renormalisation scale would loose their corresponence ( valid in the on - shell scheme ) with space - time processes . with on - shell renormalisation",
    ", the decoupling of heavy particles at low scales is understood in terms of a natural hierachy of physical scales .",
    "it seems reasonable that the physics of the strong interaction at the scale of the charm quark mass , @xmath205 , should be independent of the value of the top quark mass , @xmath206 , when @xmath207 .",
    "according to the the uncertainty principle , the contribution to vacuum polarisation loops of particles with masses much greater than the propagator virtuality are expected to correspond to short lifetime fluctuations giving only a small contribution to the radiative correction .",
    "this is no longer the case if the rcc is renormalised at scales @xmath208 .",
    "an enormously successful phenomenology of the strong interaction has been developed over the past three decades based on perturbative qcd .",
    "many aspects of qcd , such as : the existence of the colour quantum number , of spin one gluons with self - coupling , the predicted values of colour factors , and a coupling constant that decreases with increasing scales in the experimentally accessible region , are confirmed , beyond doubt , experimentally  @xcite .",
    "however , it might be hoped that the physical predictions of a candidate gauge _ theory _ would be gauge invariant at all orders in perturbation theory , as is the case in qed .",
    "explicit calculation for the current non - abelian gauge theories ( both qcd and electro - weak theory ) , as reviewed in the present paper , seems to show , however , that this is not the case . the point with error bars at @xmath123  gev on the loop gauge curve in fig .",
    "3 shows the uncertainty on @xmath6 ( @xmath209 ) of an early measurement using hadronic @xmath198 decays at lep  @xcite .",
    "the input value @xmath210gev@xmath211 has been chosen to be consistent with deep inelastic scattering measurements  @xcite . if the asymptotic running coupling constant with time - like argument measured at lep at the scale @xmath212 has a similar value to @xmath64 for space - like argument considered in this paper , it is clear from fig .  3 that the _ measured _ value of the gauge parameter must be close to @xmath213 .",
    "on a more positive note , the phenomenological success , in qcd , of calculations based on the renormalisation group , as well as of ` renormalon ' based models , both of which are shown here to require the use of the @xmath1 gauge , suggests that further understanding requires a deeper theoretical explanation of nature s apparent choice of this gauge ( see fig .",
    "the question is , why , in non - abelian theories , do uv divergent loop diagrams apparently acquire logarithmic corrections after renormalisation but not similar vertex diagrams ?",
    "since the non - abelian triple gluon vertex occurs in both loop ( vacuum polarisation ) and vertex insertions it seems that consistency with experiment requires the cancellation of vertex contributions when summed over the complete particle content of the theory .",
    "that is , in some conjectured modified version of qcd , complete cancellation of triangle vertex insertions similar to the anomaly cancellation provided by the particle content of the fermion families of the standard model .",
    "however , consistency with the diagrammatic description ( i.e. with quantum mechanical superposition ) must always limit the scale - range of applicability of the rcc due to the convergence properties of geometric series .    finally , two important caveats concerning the work presented in this paper should be mentioned .",
    "firstly , only covariant gauges specified by the parameter @xmath34 are considered , whereas certain non - covariant gauges  @xcite such as axial gauge ( @xmath214 ) or light - cone gauge ( @xmath215 , @xmath216 ) are freqently employed in qcd phenomenology .",
    "the second concerns the recently developed successful application of analytical perturbation theory ( apt ) to qcd phenomenology  @xcite . in order to avoid infra - red divergences when @xmath217 in the conventional qcd perturbation series for the rcc , apt introduces , by way of the kllen - lehmann spectral representation of the dressed gluon propagator , the condition of analyticity in the @xmath218 variable .",
    "this also imposes a causality requirement . in this case , the correspondence between the so - obtained ` euclidean running couplant ' , @xmath219 , and the sum of a qcd perturbation series , in which the terms represent the contribution of specific feynman diagrams , breaks down .",
    "no statements may then be made concerning the gauge dependence and convergence properties of @xmath219 .",
