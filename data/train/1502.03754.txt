    "the idea of extra dimensions has been around in theoretical physics for almost a century @xcite and has been considerably expanded and reinvigorated in string theory . furthermore , dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) pointed out in 2000 that we could live in a higher - dimensional world with infinitely large extra dimensions hidden from plain sight because everything except gravity can only propagate on a 3-brane in the higher - dimensional world @xcite . the idea that observation of additional dimensions does not need to be suppressed by energy thresholds , but that instead there can be consistent restrictions of matter fields to submanifolds of a higher - dimensional universe was a significant advancement of our understanding of higher dimensions .",
    "therefore we denote a 3-brane carrying matter fields in an ambient spacetime with gravitational degrees of freedom as a dgp brane , including also e.g. 3-branes in cascading gravity models @xcite . at this point",
    "we do not specify the background gravitational theory because we are interested in electromagnetic effects on the branes .    shortly after the inception of dgp branes",
    ", it was pointed out that at least at the classical level they can support a modified friedmann equation which may explain accelerated expansion without dark energy @xcite .",
    "stability of the self - accelerated solution has meanwhile been called into question @xcite , but dgp branes can nevertheless support consistent modified cosmological evolution equations which comply with standard late time flrw evolution @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it was found in @xcite and rediscovered in @xcite that dgp branes can even support the standard friedmann equation and all the corresponding standard cosmological models on the brane , i.e. absence of cosmological signals from modified evolution equations does not rule out dgp branes .",
    "it is therefore important to also look for other possible experimental signatures of dgp branes .    in the present paper",
    "i would like to draw attention to the fact that overlap of dgp branes at or after reionization can generate perturbations in the lyman @xmath2 forest in the direction of the overlap region .",
    "this is based on the observation that particles from our brane can couple to photons from a @xmath0 gauge theory on the second brane , thus impacting coulomb interactions in the overlap region .",
    "this phenomenon of possible mixing of gauge interactions between two branes in an overlap region will be denoted as crosstalk .",
    "indeed , it is possible and worthwhile to examine more general crosstalk models involving also yukawa interactions between particles in overlapping brane volumes .",
    "we will focus on crosstalk interactions between charged particles and photons to study the impact of these interactions on electromagnetic potentials and the observed redshifts of spectral lines .",
    "crosstalk models , their impact on redshifts of spectral lines and consequences for the lyman @xmath2 forest are introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : z12 ] .",
    "implications for structure formation and appearance of superlarge structures are oulined in sec .",
    "[ sec : other ] , and the conclusions are summarized in sec . [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the action for fermions of masses @xmath4 and charges @xmath5 on our 3-brane is @xmath6\\!\\!\\!\\!&=&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\int\\!d^4x\\,\\mathcal{l}(\\psi , a ) = \\int\\!d^4x\\left[-\\frac{1}{4}f^{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\mu\\nu } \\right .",

    "we make the same assumption of approximate flatness for the second brane .",
    "at least weak curvature of at least one of the two branes will generically appear near the boundary of the overlap region , but we defer gravitational effects of overlapping branes for later studies .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the effects of electromagnetic crosstalk in approximately flat regions of overlap .",
    "a simple example of smooth overlap of two flat 3-branes is e.g. provided by a flat minkowski 3-brane with inertial coordinates @xmath7 and perpendicular coordinate @xmath8 touched by a second brane with the same @xmath9 coordinates and the embedding into flat ambient 5-dimensional spacetime given by @xmath10 this 3-brane smoothly touches our minkowski 3-brane for all values of @xmath9 and for @xmath11 .",
    "it actually smoothly penetrates through our 3-brane if we choose the plus sign in ( [ eq : touch1 ] ) .",
    "the induced metric on the second brane is @xmath12,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and vanishing of the riemann tensor is easily verified . of course",

    "we will adapt the dgp framework to the setting of smoothly overlapping 3-branes by postulating that each brane carries its own field theory for the matter degrees of freedom , and that free motion of those degrees of freedom corresponds to free fall along the geodesics in their own brane .",
    "we do not allow for particle exchange between the branes , because in that case we should rather consider a single brane having non - trivial topology and carrying a single field theory for the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "the second 3-brane will carry its own @xmath0 gauge symmetry and charged particles with charges @xmath15 and masses @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding fields are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the corresponding action is @xmath19=\\int\\!d^4\\tilde{x}\\,\\mathcal{l}(\\tilde{\\psi},\\tilde{a}).\\ ] ]    how could crosstalk work ?",
    "the simplest ( but still interesting ) models would assume yukawa interactions involving scalar particles if we wish to stay within the framework of renormalizable models .",
    "however , here we assume that our electrons and protons can see the photons from the second brane in those volumes where the branes overlap .",
    "renormalizability implies that the coupling of the charged particles on our brane to the photons from the second brane in the overlap region @xmath20 is @xmath21=\\int\\!dt\\int_{v_{12}}\\!d^3\\bm{x}\\sum_i g_i\\overline{\\psi}_i \\gamma^\\mu\\tilde{a}_\\mu\\psi_i,\\ ] ] and a corresponding equation for the coupling @xmath22 $ ] of our photons to the fermions from the second brane .",
    "note universality of the propagation speed of the @xmath0 gauge fields on both branes , because the free equations of motion for both kinds of photons in the overlap region are @xmath23    in the overlap region , the @xmath0 from the second brane would enhance our own @xmath0 symmetry to @xmath0 @xmath24 @xmath0 , @xmath25 @xmath26 the onset of the additional @xmath0 couplings at the boundary @xmath27 of the overlap region generates steplike discontinuities in the equations of motion but no @xmath28 function terms , since the discontinuties enter only through the @xmath29 and @xmath30 terms in the lagrange equations .",
    "note that due to the lack of restrictions on @xmath0 gauge couplings , electromagnetic crosstalk between overlapping branes appears like a natural and generic possibility if both branes carry @xmath0 gauge theories .",
    "the same can not be said about non - abelian crosstalk , since the gauge transformations for a non - abelian gauge field @xmath31 require universality of the gauge coupling @xmath32 for the non - abelian group . therefore , while the two branes would not need to carry the same sets of representations of a non - abelian gauge group for corresponding crosstalk , non - abelian crosstalk coupling constants would be restricted by the requirements @xmath33    calculating the energy - momentum tensor for @xmath34 in coulomb gauge ( see e.g. sec .",
    "21.4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) yields the coulomb interaction terms in the hamiltonian in the overlap region , @xmath35 @xmath36 and a corresponding term @xmath37 for the internal coulomb interactions in the second brane .",
    "here we used the schrdinger picture field operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 are dirac labels . superficially , ( [ eq : h11 ] ) always looks repulsive between dirac fields of the same flavor , but recall that the actual particle and anti - particle creation operators are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . substituting the mode expansions @xmath42 and normal ordering leads to the attractive coulomb terms between particles and their anti - particles .",
    "the effective modification of coulomb interactions between charged particles on our brane has all kinds of interesting possible consequences .",
    "everyday physics as we know it could be strongly modified in the overlap region .",
    "the electrostatic repulsion between electrons or protons would increase according to @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the effective coupling constant between electrons and protons would change from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "hydrogen atoms could be weaker or more strongly bound , or not bound at all if @xmath47 in this case , positrons could bind with protons because charge conjugation still applies to the dirac equations in the overlap region and therefore @xmath48 .",
    "the term ( [ eq : h12 ] ) would allow for the formation of exotic bound states of particles from the two branes .",
    "furthermore , if we assume matter / anti - matter asymmetry also on the second brane , the coulomb term ( [ eq : h12 ] ) seems to favor electromagnetic attraction between the branes if @xmath49 and electromagnetic repulsion if @xmath50 .",
    "here we used the fact that the sum over charges of non - confined low - energy particle states in our brane vanishes , @xmath51 .",
    "this leaves a lot of interesting possible implications of 3-brane overlap .",
    "however , except for the particular case @xmath52 , there will be hydrogen type bound states of particles with reduced mass @xmath53 in the overlap region , albeit with a potentially very different effective fine structure constant @xmath54 the energy levels of these hydrogen type atoms are therefore shifted in leading order according to @xmath55 which implies a corresponding shift in emitted or absorbed wavelengths @xmath56 the apparent redshift of the overlap region would therefore be @xmath57 or in the case of very weak inter - brane gauge couplings , @xmath58 , @xmath59    if the second brane would carry a gauge group @xmath60 , the crosstalk parameter @xmath1 would apparently have the form @xmath61 .",
    "we have @xmath62    the observational signature of a brane overlap region at a redshift @xmath63 would be a distortion of redshift binnings of hydrogen type clouds in the direction of the overlap region . for lyman forests from quasars at @xmath3 the signature would be a thinning of absorption lines in the range of the actual redshift parameter @xmath64 of the overlap region @xmath20 , accompanied by higher intensity of absorption lines at higher redshift or at lower redshift depending on whether the inequalities in ( [ eq : ggcond ] ) hold or not . if the overlap region is near the onset of the gunn - peterson trough , it can delay or advance the apparent onset of the trough in the direction of @xmath20 , i.e. reionization would appear to have occured earlier or later in the direction of @xmath20 than in other directions in our 3-brane .",
    "electromagnetic crosstalk increases repulsion between like particles and can weaken or strengthen electromagnetic coupling between electrons and protons depending on @xmath1 ( [ eq : ggcond ] ) .",
    "this also implies that bremsstrahlung emission into ordinary photons is weaker or stronger in @xmath20 since the emission probability will be proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "however , the total bremsstrahlung emission probability from electrons into both kinds of photons will be proportional to @xmath66 $ ] , and the same proportionality also holds for dipole emission from atomic transitions .",
    "this implies that we get weaker total electromagnetic emission in a smaller @xmath1 range than the range in condition ( [ eq : ggcond ] ) , @xmath67 we expect electromagnetic cooling of contracting gas clouds to be less efficient for @xmath68 and more efficient otherwise .",
    "increased mass density in an overlap region yields stronger curved geodesics , but it does not help with the formation of stars and galaxies if cooling is suppressed",
    ". therefore we would expect slower formation of stars and galaxies in an overlap region where the inequalities in ( [ eq : ggcond2 ] ) hold , and accelerated formation otherwise .",
    "the effect on structure formation should have the following consequences for the observed perturbation of absoption lines at the redshift @xmath64 of the region @xmath20 :    if the inequalities in ( [ eq : ggcond ] ) do not hold , the apparent redshift @xmath69 would satisfy @xmath70 , and there could be more hydrogen clouds with higher column densities in the overlap region due to @xmath71",
    ". the thinning out of absorption lines at @xmath64 should be there , but the increase at @xmath70 would be more pronounced than from the redshift effect ( [ eq : z12 ] ) alone .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the inequalities in ( [ eq : ggcond2 ] ) hold , the apparent redshift @xmath69 would satisfy @xmath72 , and there might also be fewer hydrogen clouds with smaller column densities in the overlap region .",
    "the thinning out of absorption lines at @xmath64 should be there , but the increase at @xmath72 would be less pronounced .",
    "please note that this scenario of reduced radiative cooling due to brane overlap could also help with the problem of overcooling in star formation histories , see e.g. @xcite and references there for a discussion of the overcooling problem .    as pointed out in sec .",
    "[ sec : z12 ] , the primary observational effect of electromagnetic crosstalk between branes should be depletion of signals at the redshift @xmath64 of the overlap region @xmath20 and increase of signals at the redshift @xmath69 ( [ eq : z12 ] ) .",
    "radiation sources in @xmath20 would then be assigned to higher or lower redshift values , depending on @xmath1 . in terms of visible radiation signals , a large brane overlap region @xmath20",
    "would then appear as a dark trough in front or behind an apparent wall , or as a dark channel in front or behind an apparent filament . whether the observed superlarge structures at @xmath73 @xcite or @xmath74 @xcite could be explained by brane crosstalk",
    "would then depend on successful correlation with corresponding perturbations in the lyman @xmath2 forest .",
    "the discovery of these superlarge structures could herald the dawn of brane astronomy .",
    "equation ( [ eq : h11 ] ) shows that crosstalk between gauge theories in overlapping branes affords local gauge couplings without promoting the couplings themselves to dynamical fields .",
    "this should impact the redshift distribution of lyman @xmath2 absorption lines by suppressing absorption lines at the redshift @xmath64 of the brane overlap region while increasing intensity of absorption lines at higher or lower redshift @xmath69 ( [ eq : z12 ] ) , depending on the electromagnetic crosstalk parameter @xmath1 . the redshift distortion from overlapping branes can also generate apparent large scale structure on scales that would violate size limits from structure formation in an isolated evolving 3-brane , thus explaining the possible absence of an `` end of greatness '' .",
    "it is known since 1971 that quasars shine light on the intergalactic medium .",
    "maybe quasars shine light on branes , too .",
