    "in this paper we propose a microscopic model for a system of partial differential equations consisting in a transport equation , having pure loss collision term , and a pure loss reaction equation ; the equations are self  consistently coupled and they are meant to describe the evolution in time of the phase space densities in a binary mixture where the two species interact in such a way that each species inhibits the activity of the other , with an interaction proportional to their macroscopic ( position space ) densities . in particular ,",
    "we want to rigorously derive the system of equations in a suitable asymptotics for the particle system .",
    "the system of equations we shall deal with is a sort of very simple reactive transport system , though without conservation of masses ; more complex reactive transport systems arise in many different contexts , like for instance in the modeling of biological systems , of porous media , of radiative transfer or , more in general , of various systems in the presence of chemical reactions ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "we are interested here in the analysis of the simplest reactive self - consistent coupling ( i.e. the absorption coupling ) , and we shall therefore not include other terms in the equations .    from the point of view of particle modeling , an analysis of the absorption self - consistent coupling for one species nonlinear equations can be found in models for reaction - diffusion equations , such as the ones proposed in @xcite and @xcite ; in both papers , the particle system evolves according to a brownian motion ( to get the diffusion ) and destruction of particles occurs with different mechanism : in the first paper the destruction is stochastic , with a death rate for the brownian particles which is a function of stochastic exponential times , in the second one it is deterministic , and it happens as soon as collisions between particles occur .",
    "we shall consider a binary semi ",
    "deterministic system where both kinds of interactions occur .",
    "more precisely , the particle system we shall consider consists in point like ( light ) particles moving uniformly among fixed , spherical particles ( obstacles ) .",
    "particles not belonging to the same species do not interact among themselves and particles of different species interact in the following way : a light particle becomes inactive ( or is absorbed ) at the first time it meets an obstacle and an obstacle becomes inactive ( or disappears ) in a stochastic interval of time whose size is connected , through a local mean - field type interaction , to the number of light particles traveling within the area of detection ( range ) of the obstacle .",
    "the main difficulty in the derivation of the ( otherwise simple ) system of partial differential equations originates from the self consistent structure of the problem : in order to overcome the mathematical troubles introduced from the self  consistent terms , we shall adopt a natural scheme for facing self  consistent problems in partial differential equations and particle systems and we shall prove the convergence using two levels of approximation of the original particle system , the first one eliminating the self - consistent structure and the second one reducing the correlations between the two species with respect to the original many - particle system .",
    "our formalism is quite explicit and the strategy we shall adopt is similar to the procedure used in @xcite .",
    "the adjustment of this procedure to our particle system is not trivial , since , at variance with the situation treated in @xcite , we deal with a two species system interacting in a non symmetric way and the instantaneous absorption of the light particles is in some sense a singular interaction with respect to the local mean - field type interaction which govern the obstacles lifetime , i.e. the interaction type considered in @xcite .",
    "the presence of the deterministic component ( the light particles ) imposes a sufficiently careful analysis of the trajectories , in the style of the analysis performed for particle models of linear equations based on similar deterministic components ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of the stochastic component ( the obstacles ) simplifies by a considerable amount the mathematics with respect to a two component , totally deterministic system .",
    "our final theorem establishes a weak law of large numbers for the empirical measures ( associated to the two species of particles in the mixture ) to the solution of the system of partial differential equations , almost surely with respect to the initial distribution of positions in the phase space of the light particles and in probability with respect to the distributions of positions and life time of the obstacles .",
    "this weak law of large numbers is valid in an asymptotics where the radius and the effective range of the obstacles vanish , keeping a finite action in the limit , and the number of particles grows up to infinity , these quantities being related in a way that we shall determine while proving the theorem . as a part of this relationship",
    ", we shall prove a simple condition ( relating the diminishing rate of the effective range of the obstacles to the number of light particles ) which guarantees the weak convergence of the product of an empirical measure times a sufficiently regular approximant of a dirac delta distribution toward the product of their weak limits ( under suitable regularity assumptions on the weak limit of the empirical measure and on the choice of the delta s approximant ) .",
    "this condition entails very useful bounds for our estimates and allows to get easily the required asymptotic result .",
    "throughout the paper we shall use the following notations : in dimension @xmath0 , we denote by @xmath8 the position of a light particle and by @xmath9 its velocity ; @xmath10 is the time variable . in general , configurations of @xmath11 variables in @xmath12",
