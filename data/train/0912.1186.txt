    "the problem of interaction of a finite - dimensional hamiltonian system with an infinite - dimensional one always attracted attention of physicists and specialists in dynamics . in comparison with the finite - dimensional dynamics in spite of",
    "the energy preservation in this situation in general some effective dissipation appears .",
    "more precisely , a part of the energy can tend to be `` unobservable '' because of a radiation ( existence of waves , going to infinity ) and because of transformation into heat ( when some @xmath0-component of a solution oscillates faster and faster , and weakly tends to zero , keeping a noticeable part of the total energy ) . note that by using the fourier transform one can see that these two mechanisms are dual .",
    "the problems of this kind are complicated and usually the infinite - dimensional system has to be chosen linear while the finite - dimensional system can be linear or nonlinear .",
    "the infinite - dimensional part can be a thermostat @xcite , a string ( or more generally , the klein - gordon system ) @xcite , or an electromagnetic field ( the maxwell equations ) @xcite .",
    "below we regard the infinite - dimensional system as a continual collection of independent oscillators .",
    "we call it a thermostat . note that thermostat is only one of possible physical interpretations of the infinite - dimensional system in our context , probably , not quite unquestionable .",
    "in this paper we assume that total energy of the system is finite .",
    "our method is based on the simple observation that the finite - dimensional system should oscillate in a way which does not produce a resonance in the thermostat .",
    "( existence of such a resonance implies infiniteness if the energy . )",
    "this condition imposes some restrictions on the fourier spectrum of the finite - dimensional component of the solution . in the examples ( section [ sec : exa ] ) these restrictions imply simple final dynamics of the finite - dimensional subsystem .",
    "in section [ sec : exa ] we consider a one - dimensional oscillator . in the nonlinear case we present some natural sufficient conditions for the thermostat such that the oscillator tends to equilibrium positions as @xmath1 .",
    "if the oscillator is linear , some kind of synchronization can happen and the final dynamics of the system can be a harmonic oscillation with some `` eigenfrequency '' . in both cases a part of the total energy `` dissolves '' in the thermostat , i.e. , it is concentrated in a component of the thermostat motion which weakly tends to zero .",
    "now we turn to more technical part .",
    "consider the lagrangian system @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a smooth @xmath4-dimensional manifold , @xmath5 are local coordinates , and the lagrangian @xmath6 equals the difference of the kinetic and potential energy @xmath7 the square @xmath8-matrix @xmath9 is assumed to be positive definite .",
    "hence , it determines a riemannian metric on @xmath3 .",
    "then the product @xmath10 is the square of the riemannian length of the velocity vector @xmath11 .",
    "such lagrangian systems are usually called _",
    "natural_.    consider another system , called a thermostat .",
    "this is an infinite - dimensional linear lagrangian system with lagrangian @xmath12 ( for brevity we use the notation @xmath13 for @xmath14 . )",
    "one can regard it as a continual collection of independent harmonic oscillators , parameterized by the internal frequency of oscillations @xmath15 .",
    "physical meaning of @xmath16 is the density of oscillators with the frequency @xmath15 .",
    "equations of motion of the isolated thermostat are @xmath17    now suppose that these two systems interact and the interaction potential is linear in @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a smooth function .",
    "in other words we consider the system with lagrangian @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of motion are as follows : @xmath22 we take initial values in the form @xmath23 the total energy is @xmath24    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : mth ] starts from formulation of our assumptions on the functions @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "a part of these assumptions is responsible for regularity of these functions .",
    "another part ensures positive definiteness of the energy @xmath27 .",
    "we need this positive definiteness to prove theorem [ theo : existence ] on the existence of a solution to system ( [ 1st]),([2nd]),([ini ] ) .",
    "we consider the space @xmath28 of bounded uniformly continuous functions on a line and the space @xmath29 of distributions , obtained as fourier transforms of functions from @xmath28 .",
    "the subspace @xmath30 consists of the functions , vanishing at infinity . for any distribution @xmath31",
    "we define its singular support @xmath32 as follows .",
    "we say that @xmath33 if there exists a regular ( for example , smooth ) function @xmath34 with @xmath35 in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath36 such that fourier transform of @xmath37 does not lie in @xmath38 .    except theorem [ theo : existence ]",
    "section [ sec : mth ] contains formulation of theorem [ theo : exotic ] , an important technical tool .",
    "assertion ( 1 ) of theorem [ theo : exotic ] means that the fourier transform @xmath39 of the function @xmath40 is regular on the `` essential spectrum '' @xmath41 of the thermostat . here",
    "@xmath42 is the set of essential frequencies of oscillators in the thermostat .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath41 is as follows .",
    "oscillators from the thermostat with frequencies outside of @xmath41 do not influence the finite - dimensional part of the system and therefore , can be ignored .",
    "formally , @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "regularity of @xmath39 on @xmath41 means that @xmath45 .",
    "assertion ( 2 ) of theorem [ theo : exotic ] can be regarded as a relation between the singular part of @xmath39 and the singular part of @xmath46 , the fourier transform of @xmath47 .",
    "the last integral is taken from the right - hand side of ( [ 1st ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : exa ] contains applications of our technical observations to the case of one - dimensional oscillator .",
    "first we show that the well - known klein - gordon equation generates a thermostat , i.e. , it is equivalent to an infinite - dimensional lagrangian system with lagrangian ( [ l_t ] ) .",
    "we define thermostats used in this section as the ones , satisfying hypothesis * t*. conditions , presented in it are motivated by the properties of the klein - gordon thermostat .",
    "then we specify the finite - dimensional part of the system , by considering a one - dimensional oscillator with @xmath48 with some smooth potential @xmath49 .",
    "we take @xmath50 and distinguish two cases : linear ( @xmath51 ) and nonlinear ( @xmath49 is arbitrary ) .    in the linear case",
    "we show that , when @xmath1 , depending on parameters of the system the oscillator tends to the equilibrium position ( theorem [ theo : empty ] ) or to some harmonic motion with an eigenfrequency @xmath52 ( theorem [ theo : linear ] ) .",
    "the last situation can be regarded as some kind of synchronization in the total system . in the nonlinear case",
    "we have to assume that the spectrum @xmath41 is very large ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "then we obtain that the oscillator tends to some equilibrium positions which can be different for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and belong to the set of critical points of the effective potential @xmath56 , @xmath57 . in section [ sec : existence ] we obtain some a priori estimates which follow from the energy preservation and prove theorem [ theo : existence ] . in section [ sec : psi ]",
