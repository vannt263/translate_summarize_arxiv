    "through dimensional transmutation , the dimensionless classical coupling constant of qcd is transformed to a running coupling controlled by a physical scale @xmath1 .",
    "roughly speaking , weak coupling perturbative approximations to processes with momentum transfer @xmath2 are expansions in @xmath3 ) .",
    "this gives excellent results when @xmath4 is large .",
    "when one can not rely on that , an alternative is the large @xmath0 approach .",
    "the gauge group is generalized to @xmath5 , and the expansion is in @xmath6 .",
    "although the large @xmath0 limit of yang - mills theory is still out of reach , it is known that it enjoys several simplifications . among them",
    "is the possibility of reducing the space - time volume without affecting certain physical results  @xcite .",
    "continuum reduction  @xcite , _ i.e. _ reduction to a physical size of order @xmath7 avoids some of the difficulties  @xcite with reduction to a single space - time point .",
    "the addition of double trace terms to the action  @xcite is an alternative approach .",
    "it is now practical to obtain good results by combining continuum reduction with numerical simulations needing only modest resources . in previous numerical work  @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that not only bulk quantities but also physical quantities based on wilson loops are accessible .",
    "the previous results based on wilson loops have been in three dimensions . in the work described here ,",
    "we show that the method is still practical in four dimensions .",
    "we have used continuum reduction and monte carlo simulation to calculate the heavy quark potential and the string tension in large @xmath0 yang - mills theory in four dimensions .",
    "an important aspect of the method is that reduction allows the calculation of infinite volume , infinite @xmath0 wilson loops that are larger than the reduced lattice . in particular , in this work , the heavy quark potential is calculated out to a separation of nine lattice units on a lattice with extent six in each direction .",
    "the results for the string tension are compatible with those obtained on large lattices at smaller @xmath0 .",
    "the standard wilson yang - mills action with gauge group @xmath5 is used . in the large @xmath0 limit , @xmath8 is taken to zero with the inverse t hooft coupling @xmath9 held fixed .",
    "we report results with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 on a lattice of size @xmath13 .",
    "this is large enough so that in the range of available @xmath14 , the lattice is not too coarse but is still small enough to give a manageable computational cost .    in four dimensions ,",
    "the useful range of couplings and physical lattice spacings @xmath15 on a given lattice is more limited than in three dimensions . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the system becomes unstable to the bulk transition for small @xmath14 .",
    "the smallest @xmath14 we have used is 0.3450 , which is just above the unstable point . for sufficiently large @xmath14 ,",
    "the center symmetry breaks in one lattice direction , and reduction no longer holds in that direction .",
    "this is the large @xmath0 limit of the finite temperature phase transition  @xcite . for @xmath13",
    "it occurs at about @xmath16 .",
    "our calculations are at @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 with most of the results at @xmath18 . as measured by the critical size for the finite - temperature transition , that is a range from about @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "thus the possibilities for testing scaling are quite limited . for this lattice size",
    ", this entire useful range of @xmath14 is in the region that is metastable to the bulk transition .",
    "nevertheless , we encountered no bulk transitions during the simulations .",
    "as described in previous work  @xcite , we update the gauge field configurations with heat bath and over - relaxation methods . in this work",
    ", one update will mean one heat bath sweep followed by one over - relaxation sweep .",
    "measurements of the wilson loops were separated by ten updates .",
    "the values for the wilson loops are based on 1200 measurements .",
    "the measurements of wilson loops are made on smeared configurations .",
    "the use of smeared links improves the measurement of wilson loops .",
    "they enhance the overlap of the space - like sides of the wilson loops with the ground state .",
    "this increases the signal relative to the fluctuations and simplifies the @xmath22 behavior of the loops  @xcite .",
    "the smearing is a four - dimensional version of the method used in  @xcite .",
    "one lattice direction is arbitrarily chosen as the  time \" direction .",
    "links in the remaining three spatial directions ( but not in the time direction ) are smeared .",
    "after the wilson loops in these  time \"- space planes are measured , the process is repeated with each of the other lattice directions chosen as  time . \"    when smearing the links in spatial directions , only staples in spatial planes are used .",
    "one step in the iteration takes one from a set @xmath23 to a set @xmath24 . before reunitarization ,",
    "the weight of @xmath23 is @xmath25 while that of each staple is @xmath26 .",
    "there are two parameters , namely , the smearing factor @xmath27 and the number of smearing steps @xmath28 .",
    "we use @xmath29 and @xmath30 so that @xmath31 and the associated length scale is @xmath32 .",
    "the use of finer smearing steps @xmath33 , @xmath34 or a larger length scale @xmath29 , @xmath35 was more costly and did not lead to further improvement .",
    "data were collected on planar , rectangular wilson loops of size @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ranging from 1 to 9 and with @xmath38 the extent in the  time \" direction .",
    "the @xmath38 decay of the loops is fit to a simple exponential . to avoid a possible distortion from a combination of smearing and very small error bars at the shortest separation , loops that are @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    "are not included in the fit .",
    "the rate of the exponential decay is taken as the static quark potential at the separation @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath37 dependence of the exponential is fit to obtain the string tension . with all quantities in lattice units ,",
    "the three parameter potential that is used in the fits is @xmath41 we expect @xmath42 to be positive and of order @xmath43 and @xmath44 to be negative and of order @xmath43 or o(1 ) .",
    "errors in all quantities at a fixed @xmath14 and @xmath0 are obtained by jack knife with single elimination .",
    "we have results for @xmath45 at @xmath14 values of 0.3450 , 0.3480 , and 0.3500 .",
    "in addition , there are results for @xmath10 and @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "an example of fits to wilson loop data is given in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is for @xmath47 and @xmath45 . at a fixed @xmath37 ,",
    "the decay in @xmath38 of loop data is fit to the form @xmath48 using @xmath37 and @xmath38 from 2 through 9 , inclusive .",
    "this gives the potential @xmath49 at separation @xmath37 which is then plotted as a function of @xmath37 in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "a fit of the potential for the @xmath47 and @xmath45 data to the form of eq .",
    "[ pot ] gives @xmath50    to verify that @xmath0 is sufficiently large , we have the results for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the string tensions from fits to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 data agree .    for a check of scaling in the limited range available",
    ", we can compare the potentials for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 all with @xmath45 .",
    "( for @xmath17 , it was necessary to restrict the largest dimension of the loops to 8 to obtain useful fits . )",
    "the relative physical scales are set from ratios of the critical lengths @xmath51 at which the center symmetry breaks in one direction .",
    "these are determined from the results in  @xcite .",
    "with @xmath52 we have @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively . in fig .  [ fig4 ] , we plot @xmath56 verses @xmath57 and see that there is rough agreement of the physically scaled potentials .",
    "a comparison with results on large lattices is in order .",
    "this can be done by comparing either bare quantities at the same tadpole improved coupling or by comparing a dimensionless ratio .",
    "our result for the string tension in lattice units is @xmath58 .",
    "this is at bare coupling @xmath59 which corresponds to a tadpole improved @xmath60 .",
    "( the average plaquette @xmath61 is normalized to approach one in the weak coupling limit . )",
    "as it happens , lucini , teper , and wenger  @xcite have a large lattice , @xmath62 result @xmath63 at the same @xmath64 .",
    "this falls within our much larger uncertainty range",
    ".    an appropriate dimensionless ratio of physical quantities is @xmath65 where , in our case , @xmath66 . at @xmath67 ,",
    "our result is @xmath68 .",
    "after extrapolations to infinite volume , infinite @xmath0 , and zero lattice spacing , lucini , teper , and wenger  @xcite obtain @xmath69 .    in conclusion , we have used large @xmath0 continuum reduction and monte carlo simulation to calculate the heavy quark potential and the string tension in yang - mills theory in four dimensions .",
