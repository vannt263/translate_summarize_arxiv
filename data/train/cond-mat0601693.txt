    "scanning - tunnelling microscopy techniques have developed into an important tool for studying semiconductor nanostructures in recent years .",
    "the scanning - tunnelling microscope ( stm ) covers a wide field of applications .",
    "an example of such an application is the so - called tip - induced quantum dot , a special and unique type of quantum dot that can only be studied using a stm @xcite .",
    "when a negative bias is applied between the metallic stm - tip and the semiconductor sample , the electric field extends into the structure , and a hole accumulation layer is formed at the surface under the tip .",
    "such an accumulation layer effectively screens the electric field . for sufficiently small tip apex radii ,",
    "quantization occurs both in the radial direction and along the axis normal to the surface of the structure .",
    "it should be noted that the tip - induced band bending confines only a single type of carriers , holes in our case .",
    "the electrons are repelled from the region under the tip . by putting a barrier just below the surface , injected electrons",

    "we analyze the influence of the characteristics of the confinement potential , determined by the stm - tip radius and the applied voltage , on the electroluminescence spectra of a tip - induced quantum dot in the gaas layer of the gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as / in@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum well structure @xcite .",
    "in our model we consider a multilayer structure sketched in fig .",
    "the shape of the stm tip is modelled by a  truncated cone because ,  when the tip made of a soft metal ( like pt in our case )  is pressed to the semiconductor layer , it becomes flat .",
    "the stm - tip and the gaas layer ( cap layer ) are separated from each other by an insulator layer of width @xmath2 .",

    "since the lateral size of the quantum dot is much larger than the gaas unit cell , only states around @xmath18 contribute to the wavefunctions in the quantum dot .",
    "the effect of coupling between the valence bands is very weak in the close vicinity of the center of the brillouin zone @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "hence the adiabatic approach can be used , assuming that the hole degree of freedom along the @xmath9-axis is `` fast '' while the lateral one is `` slow '' .",
    "therefore , the hole wave function is represented in a product form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the wave functions describing the motion along the @xmath9-axis and the lateral motion , respectively . the schrdinger equation governing @xmath26  reads@xmath28 where @xmath29 with @xmath30 , the electrostatic potential .",

    "our numerical approach to solve the schrdinger equation , which governs the lateral degree of freedom of the electron , is described in ref .",
    "the set of energies @xmath60 and wave functions @xmath61 together with the set of hole energies @xmath62 and wave functions @xmath63 are used to describe the electron - hole radiative recombination .",
    "the intensity of electroluminescence at a frequency @xmath64  in the quantum dot created by the stm tip is described by the following expression @xcite:@xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are , respectively , probabilities of finding holes and electrons in the corresponding quantum states , @xmath68 is the probability of the electron - hole recombination .",
    "we assume that the distribution functions @xmath66 is described by the fermi - dirac function with the quasi - fermi level @xmath34 : @xmath69 following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume that due to the radial accelerating field the non - equilibrium electron distribution is a strongly decreasing function of the angular quantum number@xmath70 . hence , the electron distribution function is approximated as @xmath71",
    "the characteristics of the structure under consideration are as follows .",
    "the thickness of the vacuum barrier is @xmath72 , while the thickness of the gaas and al@xmath0ga@xmath1as layers are , correspondingly , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the respective dielectric constants are @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the position of the calculated peaks in the electroluminescence spectrum as a function of the voltage @xmath78 applied between the stm - tip and the semiconductor structure at @xmath79 . clearly , the peak positions as a function of the bias between the sample and the tip reveal a red shift",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "an increase of the voltage shifts the bottom ( top ) of the dot ( antidot ) upwards nearly proportional to the applied voltage .",
    "since the number of holes increases with the voltage , the width of the dot in the @xmath9-direction is reduced due to a stronger screening .",
    "hence , an increase of @xmath78 leads to a deepening of the potential well for holes and to a rise of the barrier for electrons .",
    "this , in its turn , raises the energy of the electron states , which contribute to the recombination , with respect to the bottom of the conduction band in the absence of the applied voltage .",
    "the holes experience both the rise of the energy level due to the shift of the bottom of the dot and the lowering of the energy level due to a stronger confinement .",
    "the net effect of both trends is an upward shift of the hole energy levels .",
    "the upward shift of the hole energy levels with increasing @xmath78 is larger than that for electrons .",
    "thus , these shifts result in a _ red shift _ in the electroluminescence spectrum ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the peak positions for the spectrum shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3 as a function of the radius of the stm - tip . when the radius of the stm - tip @xmath80 , one notices that the enlargement of the radius @xmath6  leads to a rise of the transition energies ( blue shift ) .",
    "this is understood on the basis of the fact that an enlargement of the contact area shifts on average the conduction and valence bands upwards , resulting in a rising potential barrier for electrons and a slight deepening of the potential well for holes .",
    "consequently , the recombining electron has to occupy a higher energy level in order to have a considerable overlap integral with a hole wave function .",
    "our calculations show that the upward shift of the hole levels is smaller than the increase of the energy of the recombining electron .",
    "so , a change of the contact area influences both hole and electron levels , but due to the weak confinement for holes in the radial direction , the shifts of the electron and the hole levels jointly lead to a _ blue shift _ of the transition energy ( this behavior of the transition energy as a function of the tip radius has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    as distinct from that type of behavior , for @xmath81 an increase of the contact area between the stm - tip and the semiconductor sample results in a _ red shift _ of the transition energy .",
    "the explanation of this phenomenon is as follows .",
    "when the radius of the stm - tip @xmath6 is much smaller than the thickness of the gaas layer , the electrostatic field from the stm - tip hardly extends into this layer , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "hence , the band bending in the gaas layer is negligible . in this case",
    "the energies of the transitions between hole and electron levels are practically equal to those in the case without any external field .",
    "an enlargement of the contact area increases the extension of the electrostatic field into the structure , as shown in fig .",
    "this effect is similar to that of an increase of the applied voltage . in both cases",
    "transition energies become smaller ( red shift ) . however , under the further enlargement of the contact area the electrostatic field within this area extends almost homogeneously over the whole semiconductor layer , see fig .",
    "5(c ) . as the luminescence originates in this case from the edge of the stm - tip - induced quantum dot , there occurs a smaller rate of decrease of the transition energies with increasing radius .",
    "finally , when the radius @xmath80 , the effects giving rise to the blue shift , described in the previous paragraph , prevail .",
    "thus , we have shown a strong effect of the confinement potential , as determined by the stm - tip radius and the applied voltage , on the electroluminescence peak positions .",
    "namely , while an increase of the voltage on the stm - tip results in a _ red shift _ of the electroluminescence peaks @xcite , an increase of the contact area between the stm - tip and the semiconductor structure results in a _ non - monotonous _ variation of peak positions . below a certain critical value of the tip radius , the transition energies decrease with increasing radius , while above the critical radius of the tip , the transition energies are an increasing function of radius .",
    "these results demonstrate vast possibilities of tuning optical characteristics of the stm - tip induced quantum dot by varying parameters of the stm - tip .",
