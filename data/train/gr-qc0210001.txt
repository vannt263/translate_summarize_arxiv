    "massive fields are forbidden in the exterior of any stationary black hole . such statement rest in the fact that the strongest version of the `` no  hair '' conjecture establishes that a stationary black hole is uniquely determined by global charges ( conserved gauss  like surface integrals at spatial infinity ) @xcite , but massive fields exponentially fall  off at infinity and made no contributions to the corresponding surface integrals",
    "; there are no global charges associated with them .",
    "this kind of unobserved  from  infinity configuration is what is called `` hair '' in the literature .",
    "the first results explicitly showing the nonexistence of massive `` hair '' were due to bekenstein who studied massive scalar fields , proca  massive spin1 fields , and massive spin2 fields @xcite .",
    "this paper intents to improve the original demonstration of bekenstein for proca fields in the presence of static black holes .",
    "such demonstration depends on an integral identity only built from matter field equations ; no einstein equation is used .",
    "the fundamental changes introduced in the proof are related to the arguments concerning the event horizon , which are usually the more involved . on the one hand ,",
    "an essentially appropriate integration measure is introduced on the event horizon , which is a degenerate hypersurface . as a consequence the horizon contribution to the cited integral identity is more elaborate . on the other hand ,",
    "the bekenstein proofs are usually announced as independent of the particular metric theory of gravity ( see @xcite ) ; due to they involve only matter field equations .",
    "however , we shall show that in order to vanishing properly the horizon contributions to the bekenstein s identity , it is imperative also the use of einstein s equations .",
    "we would like to point out that the appropriate justification of the `` no  hair '' conjecture for massive vector fields has been a useful tool for excluding the existence of new black hole configurations from very complicated theories as metric ",
    "affine gravity , where a relevant sector of this theory reduces to an effective einstein  proca system . secondly , but not least important , the methods developed here",
    "has also been a start point in the exclusion of `` hair '' for more complex system where the mass terms appears dynamically through spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite .    in the following sec .",
    "[ sec : proca ] the einstein  proca system is introduced and the consequences of considering this system in the exterior of a static black hole are highlighted . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] the `` no  hair '' theorem for the proca field is established using the bekenstein argument but with a different integration measure in the horizon , and helping us of the einstein equations in the reasoning .",
    "section [ sec : con ] is devoted to the relevant conclusions .",
    "the final appendix is dedicated to properly justify the use of the standard integration measure in the horizon mentioned above .",
    "in this section we introduce some fundamental properties of a proca field lying in the domain of outer communications @xmath0 of a static black hole . the einstein  proca action describing such interaction is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for scalar curvature , and @xmath3}$ ] is the field strength of the proca field @xmath4 . from ( [ eq : s ] ) the einstein and proca equations",
    "are established @xmath5",
    "@xmath6    in a static black hole the killing field @xmath7 coincides with the null generator of the event horizon @xmath8 . at the same time",
    "this field is timelike and hypersurface orthogonal in all the domain of outer communications @xmath0 .",
    "these properties of the killing field together with the simply connectedness of @xmath0 @xcite allow us to choose a global coordinate system @xmath9 , @xmath10 , in all @xmath0 @xcite such that @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are @xmath15independent , @xmath14 is positive definite in all @xmath0 , and the function @xmath13 is positive in all @xmath0 and vanishes in @xmath8 . from ( [ eq : static ] ) it can be note that staticity is equivalent to the existence of a time ",
    "reversal isometry @xmath16 in all @xmath0 .",
    "we shall assume that the proca field shares the same symmetries of the metric ; firstly , that it is stationary @xmath17 .",
    "secondly , that the staticity of the metric is also extended to the proca field @xmath18 and its field equations ( [ eq : proca ] ) in the sense of requiring they are all invariant under time  reversal transformations ( electromagnetic staticity ) .",
    "the condition of time ",
    "reversal invariance for proca equations ( [ eq : proca ] ) written in the coordinates of eq .",
    "( [ eq : static ] ) demands that the components @xmath19 and @xmath20 remain unchanged while @xmath21 and @xmath22 change sign , or the opposite scheme , i.e. , @xmath19 and @xmath20 change sign as long as @xmath21 and @xmath22 remain unchanged under time reversal @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a time  reversal invariant proca field the components @xmath21 and @xmath22 must vanish in the first case mentioned above , and the components @xmath19 and @xmath23 vanish in the second one .",
    "hence , time ",
    "reversal invariance implies the existence of two separated cases : a purely electric case ( i ) and a purely magnetic case ( ii ) .",
    "now we are ready to proof the `` no  hair '' theorem for the proca field and we start by obtaining the corresponding integral identity mentioned in the introduction .",
    "let @xmath24 be the open region bounded by the spacelike hypersurface @xmath25 , the spacelike hypersurface @xmath26 , and the pertinent portions of the horizon @xmath8 , and the spatial infinity @xmath27 .",
    "the spacelike hypersurface @xmath26 is obtained by shifting each point of @xmath25 a unit parametric value along the integral curves of the killing field @xmath7 . multiplying the proca equations ( [ eq : proca ] ) by @xmath28 and integrating by parts over @xmath29 using the gauss law , one obtains @xmath30   b_\\alpha h^{\\beta\\alpha}\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_\\beta & & \\nonumber\\\\   = \\int_{\\mycal{v}}\\left(\\frac12h_{\\alpha\\beta}h^{\\alpha\\beta }   + m^2b_\\alpha b^\\alpha \\right ) \\mathrm{d}v . & &   \\label{eq : int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary integral over @xmath26 cancels out the corresponding one over @xmath25 , since @xmath26 and @xmath25 are isometric hypersurfaces taken with reversed normals in the gauss law .",
    "the boundary integral over the infinity @xmath31 vanishes by the usual yukawa fall  off of massive fields asymptotically .",
    "we will show that the integrand of the remaining boundary integral at the portion of the horizon @xmath32 also vanishes . to achieve this goal we use the standard measure at the horizon @xcite , @xmath33}l^\\mu\\mathrm{d}\\sigma ,   \\label{eq : meas}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the null generator of the horizon , @xmath35 is the other future  directed null vector ( @xmath36 ) , orthogonal to the spacelike cross sections of the horizon , and @xmath37 is the surface element .",
    "we shall justify the use of the standard measure on the horizon in the final appendix , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : null ] ) . by using the quoted measure the horizon integrand can be written as @xmath38 in order to show that the last integrand is vanishing it is sufficient to prove that the quantities inside the parenthesis at the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : integ ] ) satisfy the following conditions : @xmath39 vanishes and @xmath40 remains bounded at the horizon .",
    "the behavior of these quantities at the horizon can be established by studying some invariants constructed from the curvature . using einstein equations ( [ eq : ein ] ) , we obtain , @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the usual hodge dual .",
    "since the horizon is a smooth surface curvature invariants are bounded there , from which it follows first that @xmath46 is bounded at the horizon . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : riccis ] ) is nonnegative in both cases ( i ) and ( ii ) , the remaining terms are also nonnegative , and consequently each one is bounded at the horizon , in particular the invariants @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "other invariants can be built from the ricci curvature ( [ eq : ein ] ) by means of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are well  defined smooth vector fields on the horizon .",
    "the first invariant reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the last term above vanishes because the bounded behavior of the invariant @xmath47 . since @xmath51 is orthogonal to the null vector @xmath35 it must be spacelike or null ( @xmath52 ) , therefore each one of the remaining terms in the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : riccinn ] ) must be bounded .",
    "the next invariant to be considered , which vanishes at the horizon by applying the raychaudhuri equation to the null generator @xcite , reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the electric field at the horizon .",
    "once again the bounded behavior of the invariant @xmath47 can be used to vanishing the last term of relations ( [ eq : riccill ] ) .",
    "the vector @xmath55 is orthogonal to the null generator @xmath34 hence must be spacelike or null ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "consequently each term on the right  hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : riccill ] ) vanishes independently , which implies that @xmath57 and that @xmath55 is proportional to the null generator @xmath34 at the horizon , i.e. , @xmath58 .",
    "the following relation arise from the last invariant to be studied @xmath59 where it has been used that @xmath60 .",
    "since @xmath61 and @xmath62 is bounded at the horizon , it follows that the second term on the right  hand side of eq.([eq : ricciln ] ) vanishes .",
    "therefore , @xmath63 is bounded at the horizon as consequence of the bounded behavior of the related left  hand side in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ricciln ] ) .",
    "summarizing , the study of the horizon behavior of all the above invariants leads to the following conclusions : the quantities @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are bounded at the horizon , and the relations @xmath68 , and @xmath58 are satisfied in the same region .",
    "now we are in position to show the fulfillment of the sufficient conditions for the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the horizon , i.e. , that @xmath69 vanishes and @xmath70 remains bounded at the horizon . using the definition @xmath71 and that @xmath60 , we obtain for the first quantity at the horizon @xmath72 where the vanishing follows from the fact that , as we just establish , @xmath63 is bounded and @xmath73 vanishes at the horizon .",
    "for the second quantity we note that @xmath74 and @xmath51 are orthogonal to the null vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 must be spacelike or proportional to @xmath34 , and @xmath51 must be spacelike or proportional to @xmath35 . using a null tetrad basis constructed with @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and a pair of linearly independent spacelike vectors , spanning the spacelike cross sections of the horizon , the @xmath74 and @xmath51 vectors can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the projections , orthogonal to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , on the spacelike cross sections of the horizon .",
    "using expressions ( [ eq : bjnt ] ) it is clear that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , i.e. , the contribution to these bounded magnitudes comes only from the spacelike sector orthogonal to @xmath34 and @xmath35 . with the help of eqs.([eq : bjnt ] )",
    "the other quantity appearing in the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) can be written as @xmath80 where the identity @xmath81 has been used . the first term in ( [ eq : int2b ] ) is bounded because @xmath82 and @xmath83 are bounded .",
    "for the second term we can apply the schwarz inequality since @xmath76 and @xmath77 belong to a spacelike subspace .",
    "thus , @xmath84 and since @xmath46 and @xmath85 are bounded at the horizon we conclude that the second term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int2b ] ) is also bounded .",
    "finally , the vanishing of the term ( [ eq : int1v ] ) and the bounded behavior of the other term ( [ eq : int2b ] ) , together with the null character of @xmath34 at the horizon lead to the vanishing of the integrand ( [ eq : integ ] ) over the event horizon .    with no contribution from boundary integrals in the identity ( [ eq : int ] ) we shall write the volume integral , using the coordinates from eq .",
    "( [ eq : static ] ) , for each one of the different cases discussed at the beginning of this section .",
    "for the purely electric case ( i ) we have @xmath86 the nonpositiveness of the above integrand , which is minus the sum of squared terms , implies that the integral is vanishing only if @xmath20 and @xmath19 vanish everywhere in @xmath29 , and hence in all @xmath0 .    for the purely magnetic case ( ii ) the volume integral reads as @xmath87 in this case",
    "the non  negativeness of the above integrand is responsible for the vanishing of @xmath22 and @xmath21 in all @xmath0 .",
    "concluding , we have proved that the proca field @xmath74 is trivial in the presence of a static black hole . it must be pointed that we improve the original proof of bekenstein on the subject by using an appropriate integration measure on the event horizon of the black hole , and also making explicit use of the gravitational field equations .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath74 implies that the action ( [ eq : s ] ) reduces to the einstein ",
    "hilbert one , for which the only static black hole is the schwarzschild solution ( see @xcite for references on improvements to the original proofs ) .",
    "the existence of static soliton ( particle  like ) configurations can be also excluded using similar arguments , since the only change in the proof is that in this case the boundary of the volume @xmath29 only consists of the isometric surfaces @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and a portion of the spatial infinity @xmath27 , i.e. , there is no interior boundary corresponding to the event horizon .",
    "the author thanks alberto garca , alfredo macas , hernando quevedo , and thomas zannias for useful discussions and hints .",
    "this research was partially supported by the conacyt grant 38495e .",
    "the author also thanks isabel negrete for typing the manuscript .    in this appendix",
    "we justify the use of the standard integration measure ( [ eq : meas ] ) in the boundary integrals on the event horizon . in the derivation of the basic identity ( [ eq : int ] ) we make use of gauss s law , which is a well  known particular form of stokes s theorem @xmath88 for some volume @xmath29 with boundary @xmath89 .",
    "the relation between both theorems rest on that the three ",
    "form @xmath90 is the hodge dual of the vector field @xmath91 @xcite , we shall explore such relation in order to find the horizon integration measure .",
    "in the stokes version we can write the boundary integrand as @xmath92 using that the three  form @xmath90 must be proportional to the volume three ",
    "form @xmath93 of the boundary @xmath89 .",
    "for example , in the case of a boundary consisting of non",
    " null surfaces the induced metric there is nondegenerate , and we can choose as volume three ",
    "form on @xmath89 the one associated with the induced metric .",
    "it is given by @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the four  dimensional volume form , @xmath96 is the unit normal to @xmath89 , and we use the plus sign if @xmath96 is spacelike and the minus one if is timelike ; in both cases the normal is chosen to be `` outward pointing '' in the volume @xmath29 in order to keep the orientation needed in stokes s theorem @xcite . for this election of the boundary volume three  form",
    "we have the relation @xmath97 , from which it follows that @xmath98 , and we recover the gauss form of the boundary integral @xmath99 here @xmath100 , and the integration measure at the boundary is the traditional one for non ",
    "null surfaces @xmath101 , where @xmath37 stands for the volume element ( @xmath102 ) following the usual notation .",
    "the above situation does not apply to null surfaces , which is our case of interest when we try to integrate on the horizon . in this case",
    "the induced metric is degenerate , and a priori there is no natural choice for the volume form .",
    "however , in the case of the event horizon we can use other geometrical objects naturally defined on it to specify a volume three  form .",
    "let @xmath34 be the null generator of the horizon , and @xmath35 be the other linearly independent and future  directed null vector orthogonal to the spacelike cross sections of the horizon , and normalized in such a way that @xmath103 . for smooth event horizon",
    "they are well  defined smooth vector fields along it . in this case the volume three ",
    "form must not be orthogonal to @xmath34 since such vector is tangent to the horizon , in fact , their interior product must coincide with the two  form expanding the area of spacelike cross sections of horizon which is obviously given by @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the volume three ",
    "form @xmath93 must satisfy the relation @xmath105 , using now the identity @xmath106 @xcite we conclude that a natural election for the volume three  form at the horizon is @xmath107 .",
    "now we can find the function @xmath108 inside the boundary integrand ; multiplying the relation @xmath109 by the three ",
    "form @xmath110^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma } = 3\\,\\eta^{\\mu\\nu[\\alpha\\beta}l_{\\mu}n_{\\nu}l^{\\gamma]}$ ] we obtain @xmath111 and expanding the left ",
