    "the linear conductance exhibits periodic peak structures as a function of a gate voltage , a phenomenon known as coulomb blockade oscillations .",
    "these peaks occur when the energy change due to tunneling of one electron into or out of the dot equals the fermi energy of the leads . apart from these resonance points , tunneling is suppressed due to the coulomb blockade.@xcite single - particle energy levels in a small quantum dot are discrete with mean level spacing @xmath4 and have decay width @xmath5 which is proportional to the tunneling rate to the left ( right ) lead . in the temperature regime @xmath6 , the line shape of the conductance peaks is@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is proportional to the gate voltage measured relative to the resonance point .",

    "the tl liquids can be realized in very narrow quantum wires @xcite or as edge states of fractional quantum hall liquids.@xcite figure [ fig : dots ] shows schematic pictures of the systems of our interest , a quantum dot coupled via tunnel barriers to one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum wires or to edge states in fractional quantum hall liquids . in both cases",
    "it is assumed that there are small but finite matrix elements for the tunneling from the points b and c of the zero - dimensional ( 0d ) states formed in the quantum dot to the points a and d of the 1d tl liquids . to fully understand the transport in these systems , it is necessary to take into account both the charging energy and the discrete energy levels in the dot .",
    "this paper is intended to give a simplified description of the resonant tunneling between tl liquids .",
