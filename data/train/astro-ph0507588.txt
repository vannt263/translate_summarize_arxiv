    "despite the small number of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) with known redshift ( several dozens ) , several correlations between intrinsic temporal or spectral parameters of the grb prompt emission and grb energetics have been discovered in the last seven years .",
    "@xcite found an anticorrelation between peak luminosity and the spectral lag ( obtained by cross - correlating the time profiles of the same grb in various energy bands ) , according to which more luminous bursts exhibit shorter lags .",
    "@xcite discovered a positive correlation between the spectral lag of the gamma - ray prompt emission and the jet - break time of the afterglow decay , according to which a small break time corresponds to a small lag and consequently to a high peak luminosity of the grb . concerning the temporal properties of grb time profiles",
    ", evidence has been found for a positive correlation between temporal variability of the light curves and isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity for the grbs with known redshift ( reichart et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter r01 ; fenimore & ramirez - ruiz 2000 ) .",
    "moreover @xcite have shown that the variability vs. peak luminosity correlation could also hold true for x - ray flashes ( xrfs ; see @xcite ) . as a consequence of the mentioned correlations , a correlation between time variability and spectral lag",
    "is also expected and confirmed for a large sample of batse bursts @xcite .",
    "the variability vs. peak luminosity correlation has been explained by several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) mainly within the framework of the standard fireball model , according to which internal shocks between ultra relativistic shells are responsible for the pulse - like structure of the grb prompt emission , while the smooth afterglow emission is due to external shocks between the fireball wind and the matter surrounding the grb progenitor ( e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "grb variability - connected properties are thought to be more sensitive to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 and , if the grb emission is beamed , to the jet opening angle and/or the viewing angle ( e.g. , @xcite ) . within the fireball model , there are different mechanisms that could account for different time variabilities , also giving possible explanations for xrf properties @xcite .",
    "in addition , the `` cannonball model '' for grbs @xcite also seems to explain the variability vs. peak luminosity correlation @xcite .    from the above correlations also luminosity estimators",
    "have tentatively been derived @xcite to investigate general properties of grbs , such as the luminosity function and the possible link with the star formation rate .",
    "in addition , empirical redshift indicators have been proposed based on the calibration derived with the small sample of grbs with known redshift , making use of the x- and gamma - ray observations alone @xcite .    in this work",
    "we test the variability vs. peak luminosity correlation using the variability definition given by r01 .",
    "we used a sample of 32 grbs with known redshift .",
    "furthermore we studied the same correlation by replacing the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity with that corrected for beaming for a subset of 16 grbs with known collimation angle provided by @xcite .    in section  [ s : obs ]",
    ", we discuss our sample of grbs ; in section  [ s : var ] we discuss the time variability analysis ; in section  [ s : lum ] we estimate the peak luminosity of the grb in our sample and compare it with the r01 results . in section  [",
    "s : results ] we present our results on variability / peak luminosity correlation , in section  [ s : disc ] we discuss our results .",
    "the sample of 32 grbs with known redshift includes 16 grbs detected by the gamma - ray burst monitor ( grbm ) @xcite on board the  satellite @xcite during the period 19972002 , two by the batse experiment @xcite aboard the _ compton gamma  ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) , six by the fregate instrument aboard _ hete - ii _ @xcite , one by konus/_wind _",
    "@xcite , one by _",
    "ulysses _ @xcite and six by bat/_swift _ @xcite .",
    "eight of the 16 grbs detected with the  grbm were also detected with batse .",
    "we used public archives for grb data obtained with batse , _ hete - ii _",
    ", konus/_wind _ , and bat/_swift_. table  [ tab : total_z ] reports the list of the grbs in our sample with mentioned the spacecraft that detected it . when the same grb has been detected by more than one instrument , we first checked the consistency of the results derived from different data sets and then concentrated on the instrument which had the best snr .",
    "the time binning of the grb light curves in our sample , which was used to derive the time variability , was the following : 7.8125  ms for the grbm data , 64  ms for batse , 164  ms for _ hete - ii _ , 64  ms for konus/_wind _ , 31.25  ms for _ ulysses_. in the case of bat/_swift _ we made use of the event files and extracted the mask - tagged light curves with a binning time of 8  ms . given that for the grbs detected with the  grbm , the high - resolution ( 7.8125-ms binning ) time profiles are available in the 40700  kev energy band , for the others we used the light curves in the energy bands which have the largest intersection with the 40700  kev band : 110320  kev ( channel 3 ) for batse , 30400  kev ( band c ) for fregate , 25100  kev for _ ulysses _ and 50200  kev for konus/_wind_. in order to match the grbm band , for bat/_swift _ we extracted the light curves from the event files in the 40350  kev band .    for grb990510 ,",
    "given that the 7.8125-ms grbm light curve is not available , we preferred to use 64-ms batse data rather than the 1-s grbm light curve .",
    "six grbs ( 980613 , 011211 , 021004 , 050126 , 050318 and 050416 ) with known redshift were not included in our sample due to their low signal , which prevented us from deriving a statistically significant variability estimate . another grb ( 021211 , detected with _ hete - ii _ ) was not included in the sample , due to the high ratio between binning time and smoothing time which could bias the variability estimate ( see section  [ s : var ] ) .",
    "other grbs with known redshift ( 000301c , 000418 , 000926 ) detected by both konus/_wind _ and _ ulysses _ were not included in our sample , because unfortunately both konus public and _ ulysses _ data cover their light curves only partially .    in the case of batse ( 970828 and 000131 ) the usual 4-channel 64-ms light curves are not available .",
    "thus we made use of the 16-channel mer spectra acquired along either entire grb with an integration time of 64  ms .",
    "therefore we rebinned the 16-energy - channel mer data both spectrally and temporally in order to reproduce as much as possible the 4-channel scheme of batse 64-ms light profiles . as we discuss below , we relied on coarse time resolution light curves only when the overall duration of the grb was very long compared to the binning time .",
    "in general the data available cover the entire time profile of the grbs in our sample .",
    "however there are some exceptions . in the case of the grbm events ,",
    "given that the high - resolution data cover 8  s before the trigger time and 98  s after it , in the case of the longest events ( 990506 and 010222 , @xmath1  s and @xmath2  s , respectively ) , it is not true . in these cases ,",
    "the measure of time variability was obtained summing the variability in the part covered by the 7.8125-ms bins with that in the part covered by 1-s ratemeters ( the tail of the burst ) .",
    "grb000210 ( @xmath3  s ) suffers from a 2.5-s long gap due to corrupted high - resolution data occurred in the middle of the burst profile . using the 1-s data , the mean 7.8125-ms light profile in the gap was reconstructed adding to the mean profile a poisson noise .",
    "the value of grb time variability so derived was found not to significantly change , even adding in the gap a non - poisson noise compatible with the 1-s time profile .    for each grb detected with the grbm , we considered the light curves of the two most illuminated units and checking whether the best signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was obtained from a single unit or by summing the two units .",
    "we found that for the 11 grbs detected by grbm and wide field cameras ( wfcs ) @xcite , the best signal is obtained from a single grbm unit ( that with the larger area exposed to the grb ) .",
    "for the five bursts detected with the grbm but not with the wfcs the best signal was obtained by summing the two most illuminated units : units 1 and 4 ( 980703 ) , 3 and 4 ( 990506 , 020405 ) , 2 and 4 ( 991216 , 010921 ) . in principle",
    "the operation of adding the counts of different units is questionable because of dead time , as it will be discussed in section  [ s : var ] . in practice , for the above cases we made sure that the results were consistent with those obtained when considering only the most illuminated unit for each grb .",
    "this has been found to be no longer true , i.e. the correction for dead time becomes not negligible , when considering very small smoothing time - scales ( rossi et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     as reported in table  [ tab : corr_coeff_beaming ] and clearly shown by fig .",
    "[ f : beaming ] , in the case of the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity the spread is smaller than in the case when the correction for beaming is applied .",
    "the results found are puzzling .",
    "we confirm the peak luminosity vs. variability correlation found by r01 when we use their sample of grbs , but we find a much larger spread of the data points when a larger sample ( 32 events ) of grbs is used . in this case the correlation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 is confirmed ( significance @xmath63@xmath7 according to non - parametric tests ) , but the data points are spread out in only two regions of the parameter space , with a bad description of the data points ( @xmath8 , 30 dof ) with a power - law function , which was the best - fitting function found by r01 . if , in spite of that , this function is used as fit model , the power - law index derived from our data ( @xmath9 ) is much lower than that found by r01 ( @xmath10 ) and inconsistent with it .",
    "the correlation becomes less significant ( see the comparison between the two sets of correlation coefficients in table  [ tab : corr_coeff_beaming ] ) when we correct the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity for the grb beaming , in contrast with the result found by @xcite who find a lower spread of the @xcite relationship when they perform this correction .",
    "we have tested the correlation found by r01 between peak luminosity and time variability following the same method used by r01 with a larger sample of grbs . for 32 grbs with known redshift",
    "we confirm the existence of a correlation between the measure of time variability defined by r01 and the isotropic - equivalent peak luminosity .",
    "however we find a much higher spread of the data points in the parameter space , with the consequence that the correlation can not be described by a power - law function as found by r01 . if , in spite of that , we fit the data with this function we find that the power - law index ( @xmath11 ) is much lower and inconsistent with that found by r01 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "if we correct the peak luminosity for the grb beaming , the correlation is less significant .",
