    "studying the x  ray emission from active galactic nuclei allows us to probe deep into their central regions , at scales of a few light minutes to a few light days from the central engine .",
    "timing and spectroscopy of the x  ray emission therefore allow us to examine the conditions and environment in which matter accretes onto a massive black hole",
    ".    of particular importance is the soft x  ray band ( 0.1  2 kev ) which has been made accessible by _",
    "rosat_. two principal emission components are found in agn spectra in this band , a power law which extends to much higher energies ( @xmath2 kev ) and an excess at low energies ( typically @xmath3 kev ) .",
    "this soft excess may be the high energy tail of the big blue bump , which dominates the bolometric luminosity of most radio quiet agn ( e.g. walter & fink 1993 , turner & pounds 1989 ) .",
    "understanding the mechanism by which the soft excess is produced is therefore essential for the construction of a realistic model of the central regions of agn .      in radio",
    "loud agn , the mechanism responsible for the hard power law is probably synchrotron or synchrotron self compton radiation from relativistic jets ( shastri et al .",
    "this may not be the case for the power law component seen in the x  ray spectra of radio quiet agn , which are in general softer than those from radio loud objects ( lawson et al .",
    "1992 ) . at @xmath45 kev ,",
    "radio quiet agn show spectral features ( fe line emission and a hardening of the spectrum above 10 kev , pounds et al .",
    "1990 ) which suggest that some of the x ",
    "rays are reflected from material near the black hole ; in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 and other seyfert 1s for which high signal to noise _",
    "asca  _ data are available , the fe line is relativistically broadened ( nandra et al .",
    "therefore , the x  ray power law component may originate in a hot corona above a relativistic accretion disk so that @xmath5 of the x  rays generated in the corona shine down on the accretion disk , and are reflected from its surface . in this model",
    "the x  ray power law may be due to photons which are emitted originally from the accretion disk itself , and then compton upscattered either by electrons in a hot plasma ( walter & courvoisier 1992 ) , or by a non - thermal distribution of relativistic electrons injected into a compact region , in which the radiation density may be so high that photon - photon collisions result in production of electron - positron pairs ( zdziarsky et al .",
    "1990 ) .    a number of models have been put forward to explain the soft excess emission of agn .",
    "one obvious model is that the soft excess ( and the whole of the big blue bump ) is thermal emission from an accretion disk surrounding a supermassive black hole ( e.g. ross , fabian and mineshige 1992 ) .",
    "alternatively , the soft excess may be due to reprocessing of the power law component by optically thin clouds that surround the central regions ( e.g. guilbert & rees 1988 ) , or the surface of an accretion disk ( e.g. ross & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "reprocessing of the radiation by electron - positron pairs can also produce a soft excess ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the reprocessing models",
    ", the soft excess responds to changes in the power law flux , with a time delay related to the distance between the power law emitter and the reprocessing material .",
    "if the power law component is caused by compton upscattering of soft x  ray and uv accretion disk photons , and accretion disk instabilities drive the variability , then the delay between the power law and soft excess components is expected to be in the opposite sense , i.e. the soft excess changes before the power law component .",
    "if the soft excess is due to reprocessing of x  rays by electron - positron pairs , time delays between the power law component and soft excess depend on the compactness of the emission region ( done & fabian 1989 ) .",
    "narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s hereafter ) are known to have strong soft excesses , ( puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 , boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) and are therefore obvious candidates for investigating the interrelation between the power law and soft excess components .",
    "however , detailed studies of individual objects have tended to concentrate on those with extreme properties , of either abnormally steep soft x ",
    "ray spectra and/or unusually large variability , e.g. re j1034 + 393 ( puchnarewicz et al . 1995 ) , iras 13224 - 3809 ( otani et al . 1996 ) , re j1237 + 264 ( brandt , pounds & fink 1995 ) .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the x  ray emission of the nearby ( z=0.013 ) , radio quiet , nls1 galaxy markarian 766 .",
    "markarian 766   fell within the field of view of the _ rosat _  pspc during 9 different observations , was observed at least once in each of the years 1991 to 1994 inclusive , and is a bright pspc source ( 1  6 counts s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the long sampling time scale provides a rare opportunity to study _ both _ the long and short term behaviour of the source .",

    "asca  _ ( leighly et al . 1996 ) , and was shown to have a warm absorber ( evidenced by absorption edges at @xmath9 kev ) and a variable power law component .",

    "data are examined in two ways : using data from three broad x  ray bands and spectral fitting at full resolution .",
    "together they provide the maximum information about the spectral variability of markarian 766  via the following procedure :    first , x  ray lightcurves are constructed in three energy bands ( section [ sec : lightcurves ] ) . using the lightcurves as a guide , x  ray spectra",
    "are then constructed at six different flux levels ( section [ sec : spectral ] ) , allowing us to examine the spectral shape of markarian 766   as it changes in brightness , and determine the contributions of the different emission components to the three x  ray bands .",
    "variations in the three colour lightcurves and hardness ratios are then used to study variability of the emission components ( section [ sec : colvar ] ) in a relatively model independent fashion . finally , we cross correlate the flux in the three different bands to look for temporal relations between the emission at different energies ( section [ sec : crosscorrelation ] ) .",

    "markarian 766   was at the centre of the pspc field of view during 4 of the observations . in the remaining 5 it was at different off - axis angles , ranging between 13.5 and 43.9 arc minutes ( see table [ tab : observations ] ) .",

    "observations should only be made with considerable caution for two reasons :    \\1 ) the point spread function ( psf ) changes with different off - axis angles .",
    "\\2 ) the pspc gain varies with off - axis angle and with time .",
    "the psf dependence on off - axis angle is reasonably well understood and is dealt with in section [ sec : psf ] .",
    "the pspc gain variation with time and off - axis angle , is well documented ( prieto , hasinger & snowden 1994 , snowden et al .",
    "1995 , turner 1993 ) and its main effect is that on - axis spectra taken in the later stages of the pspc - b lifetime are systematically different to spectra taken off - axis and/or earlier in the mission .",
    "this gain variation has some impact on this work , because it means that there is a significant difference in pspc response between observations ( p4 , p8 , p9 ) and the other observations .",
    "the ftools task pcpicor uses al k@xmath11 detector gain maps , interpolated in time , to correct for the pspc gain variations , and this has been applied to all the _ rosat _  data used here .",
    "this makes a significant improvement to the data but the authors consider that there are still some differences in response between the different observations ; this is discussed in detail in appendix a. however , the actual magnitude of the gain drift ( @xmath12 in the energy scale , before correction by pcpicor , snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) means that it should have a very small effect on the colour based hardness ratios used in this work .",
    "note that as well as the drift of the pspc gain there was an intentional change of pspc gain made in october 1991 .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the _ rosat _  pspc changes dramatically with off - axis angle , hence for the six different detector locations , different regions have been used for collecting source and background counts .",
    "source and background regions were chosen to be at similar off - axis angles ; they do not overlap with the region obscured by the pspc rib support structure , and contain no contaminating bright sources .",
    "the use of observations with different off - axis angles is justified because the dependence of the _ rosat _  psf with off - axis angle is well known except for the very low energy response ( hasinger et al .",
    "1994a ) . in observations",
    "in which markarian 766   is far off - axis ( p3 , p5 and p7 ) , large circles ( 6 arc min radius ) have been used as source and background regions to ensure that the majority of the source counts are included .    in two observations ( p1 and p3 ) , markarian 766   was occulted by the ribs of the pspc . to avoid any systematic errors in the x  ray flux as a function of time",
    ", data from all times when the source extraction region entered the ribs have been excluded ; in general this means that only a portion of the spacecraft wobble period has been included ( _ rosat _  wobbles once every 400 seconds to prevent the detector window wire grid from systematically occulting sources ) .",
    "note that this procedure is not expected to introduce significant spurious variability because we used the _ same _ part of each spacecraft wobble .",
    "the effectiveness of this technique was verified using time filtered images and lightcurves folded on the 400 second wobble period of _",
    "rosat_.    because of the proximity of markarian 766   to the ribs in p1 it was necessary to use a small circle of only 0.9 arc min radius to collect source counts , and hence the correction for counts falling outside this circle is much larger for p1 than that for the other observations ( see section [ sec : psf ] ) .",
    "p1 also differs from the other observations in that it took place before the october 1991 change of the gain ( and hence spectral response ) of the _ rosat _  pspc - b detector .",
    "p1 contains the most time intensive monitoring of markarian 766 , and during p1 markarian 766   was particularly faint ; for these reasons it is a particularly interesting observation and is retained despite the technical difficulties .",
    "the primary purpose for constructing a light curve in three different x ",
    "ray bands is to examine how the overall spectrum changes with time .",
    "the three bands are therefore required to have energy responses which are as independent as possible to prevent the smearing out of spectral changes when photons of the same energy contribute to the flux in more than one band . with a proportional counter such as the _ rosat _  pspc , it is impossible to find three energy bands which are _ completely _ independent .",
    "we have chosen the bands r1l , r4 , and r7 ( channels 11 - 19 , 52 - 69 and 132 - 201 respectively ) from snowden et al .",
    "they are centred at approximately 0.2 , 0.7 and 1.7 kev respectively , and their energy responses overlap with effective areas @xmath13 of their peak .",
    "note that with bands this narrow , a large number of pspc channels ( and hence a considerable number of source counts ) are excluded ; this is acceptable because markarian 766  is a bright source .",
    "it was noted in section [ offaxis ] that the _ rosat _  pspc psf changes with off - axis angle ; some fraction of the psf lies outside the circular region used to collect source counts .",
    "it is therefore necessary to renormalize the count rates to the full psf before data from observations with different off - axis angles can be compared .",
    "the psf of the _ rosat _  pspc depends on energy as well as position . at the energies corresponding to the r4 and r7 bands ,",
    "the dependence of the psf with off - axis angle is well understood , and is described by the analytic expressions given in hasinger et al .",
    "( 1994a ) ; r4 and r7 count rates have therefore been renormalized using these expressions .",
    "hasinger et al .",
    "( 1994a ) do not provide a good description of the psf at low energies ( i.e. the r1l band ) because of a problem known as ghost imaging , in which the positions of low pulse height events can be incorrectly determined by the pspc ( see snowden et al .",
    "the counts in r1l have been corrected using a gaussian fit to the observed r1l psf in each observation .",
    "the 90% statistical error on this gaussian fit translates to a 5% uncertainty in the corrected r1l flux of observation p1 , which has the largest uncertainty because only a small circle is used to collect source counts ( see section [ offaxis ] ) . in the other observations",
    "the renormalization of r1l amounts to a change of less than 10% , and hence the uncertainty on the r1l flux from the psf correction is not likely to be more than a few percent .",
    "two hardness ratios have been used to examine spectral changes : @xmath14 @xmath15 both @xmath16 and @xmath17 increase as the spectrum becomes harder .      to obtain good signal to noise ( typically @xmath430 ) ,",
    "counts in each band have been binned to 5760 seconds ( i.e. 1 _ rosat _  orbit ) .",
    "the x  ray lightcurves in the three x  ray bands for the four years of observation are shown in the top three panels of fig . [ fig : lightcurves ] ; note that the x - axis is not continuous .",
    "markarian 766   exhibits substantial variability ( @xmath4 factor 2 in the r4 and r7 bands ) during every observation , excepting observations p5 and p9 , which lasted only a single _ rosat _  orbit each .",
    "hardness ratios , computed from the three light curves are shown in the bottom two panels of fig . [",
    "fig : lightcurves ] .",
    "hardness ratio changes , and therefore changes in the spectral shape , are seen during all observations ( again except p5 and p9 which are too short for the variability to be addressed ) .",
    "the variability will be quantified later in section [ sec : variamp ] when the 3 colour and hardness ratio variability is looked at in more detail .",
    "before relating the lightcurves and hardness ratio changes to changes in specific components of the x  ray spectrum of markarian 766 , it is necessary to examine the spectrum itself , and obtain a good spectral model .",
    "the variable hardness ratios shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurves ] show that the spectrum is changing within the observations .",
    "we have extracted several spectra from each observation , that correspond to different levels of brightness of markarian 766 , to explore the full dynamic range of spectral shapes .",
    "traditionally , the overall _ rosat _  count rate would be used to define the intensity of the source ( e.g. molendi and maccacaro 1994 ) .",
    "this is not practical for the current dataset which includes observations at different off - axis angles because the broadband _ rosat _  count rate is sensitive to the position of the source on the pspc .",
    "it must be convolved with a model spectrum to correct for the proportion of the psf outside the source extraction circle , because the psf is energy dependent . to extract spectra as a function of overall _ rosat _  count rate , consistently for each observation , would therefore require a prior knowledge of the spectra to be extracted .",
    "this problem has been avoided by using the r4 count rate to define the intensity of markarian 766 , instead of the broadband count rate .",
    "r4 covers a narrow enough energy range that it is easy to correct for the psf in a consistent way for all observations without a detailed prior knowledge of the spectrum .",
    "r7 could equally have been used ; r4 has been preferred because it is more central in the _ rosat _  bandpass .",
    "six different levels of intensity have been defined according to the r4 count rate , and observations have been split up by their r4 count rates averaged in 5760 second bins , as shown in table [ tab : exposures ] . for each observation",
    ", all counts collected during a given range of r4 count rate were combined to make a single spectrum .",
    "up to six spectra were therefore constructed from each observation ; as seen in table [ tab : exposures ] a total of 31 spectra were constructed .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the variability amplitude in the three bands is shown in table [ tab : variamp ] .",
    "the 1@xmath18 error quoted is calculated from equation 2 in done et al .",
    "( 1992a ) and is the uncertainty in the width of an assumed underlying gaussian distribution of count rates from which the data were drawn ; note that this is not the measurement error of the count rate , which has already been subtracted in quadrature ( eq . [ eq : sigma ] ) . in _",
    "every _ observation the variability is smaller in the r1l band than in either r4 or r7 .",
    "this shows that the more variable component is the power law , which dominates the flux in r4 and r7 bands .",
    "the reduced variability amplitude in r1l shows that the soft excess is relatively invariant , diluting the overall ( power law + soft excess ) r1l variability .",
    "this means that to explain the hardness ratio variability in section [ sec : specchange ] , the power law slope _",
    "must _ vary .",
    "the time dependence of flux changes at different energies is potentially a powerful discriminator between different models for the emission mechanisms ( see section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "it has been studied by cross correlating the count rates in the three bands using the discrete correlation function ( dcf hereafter , see edelson and krolik 1988 ) .",

    "this method is appropriate to our _ rosat _  data since it requires no interpolation , and provides simple error estimates .",

    "the cross correlation was intended to reveal whether changes at the soft energies precede changes in the hard power law or vice - versa .",
    "the time bins are the same for all three bands , so there is no asymmetry in the dcf originating from the temporal sampling . since the points of the dcf are not independent , we require some simple means of testing the significance of the observed dcf against the null hypothesis that neither component leads the other . we have used a bootstrap error method : for each time lag , pairs of points were chosen at random from all the original pairs with corresponding positive _ or _ negative time lag and the dcf constructed with the same number of pairs as the real dcf ; this was repeated 1000 times and the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccor ] corresponds to the region bounding 68% of the symmetrical bootstrap simulations .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccor ] that the only significant deviation from the symmetrical bootstrap simulations is in observation p1 where there is a marked asymmetry in the dcf of r1l and r4 . to improve the signal to noise further",
    ", the dcf has been computed using a single bin for positive time lags and a single bin for negative time lags . applying our bootstrap error method",
    "we find that the observed asymmetry of the dcf of r1l and r4 is just significant at the 95% level , and that of r1l and r7 is significant at 85% for observation p1 .",
    "the dcf is within the 68% confidence limits for r7 and r4 in observation p1 and for all combinations of r1l , r4 and r7 for the other observations .",
    "thus , in p1 , when markarian 766   is at its faintest , and consequently the power law component is smallest relative to the soft excess , changes at @xmath27 kev appear to precede changes at @xmath28 kev .",
    "however , it must be pointed out that the cross correlation has been performed on 5 datasets , of which only one has 95% significant asymmetry ; the probability of one or more dataset having this level of asymmetry , by statistical fluctuation alone , is 23% .",

    "766   varies continuously in every observation period .",
    "the spectral variability takes the same form in every observation , which can be explained by variability of the power law slope and normalization .",
    "given that the behaviour is the same throughout the pspc pointed observations from 1991 to 1994 , the same spectral variability would be expected in the _ asca  _ observation of markarian 766   in 1993 .",
    "leighly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report that the major change in the _ asca  _ band was that the power law slope became steeper as the power law flux in the _ asca  _ band increased .",
    "this behaviour is entirely consistent with the spectral variability seen in the _ rosat _  observations and reported here .",
    "similarly , in the _",
    "exosat  _ me observations of 1985 and 1986 steeper power law photon indices are found for increased power law normalization ( molendi , maccacaro & schaeidt 1993 ) .",
    "there are two popular models for the power law x  ray component of radio quiet agn ; both are based on compton upscattering of uv or soft x ",
    "ray photons from an accretion disk or optically thin plasma . in the first model ,",
    "the observed power law emission is simply that from upscattering of the soft photons in a hot ( kt @xmath0 500 kev ) plasma , or by a non - thermal distribution of relativistic electrons ( walter & courvoisier 1992 ) . in the second model ,",
    "the emission originates in a region in which the radiation density is large enough that the region is opaque to photon - photon collisions ( @xmath29ray - @xmath29ray or @xmath29ray - x  ray ) which give rise to electron - positron pairs .",
    "these pairs down scatter the @xmath29ray radiation and produce the observed x  ray spectrum , including the soft x ",

    "_ both _ these models predict that in the variability of a single source the power law slope is softer when the power law flux is higher ( done & fabian 1989 , g. torricelli - ciamponi & courvoisier 1995 ) as observed in markarian 766 .    leighly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that markarian 766   has sufficient radiation density in the emission region that pair production may be important .",
    "the compactness parameter is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the luminosity , @xmath32 is the size of the source , @xmath33 is the thompson scattering cross section , @xmath34 is the mass of the electron and @xmath35 is the speed of light ; pair production may be important if @xmath36 ( svensson 1987 ) . using the shortest factor 2 variability time from the _ asca  _ lightcurve ( @xmath37 ) to define the size of the source , assuming @xmath38 , leighly et al .",

    "leighly et al .",
    "( 1996 ) propose that the variability observed during the _ asca  _ observation is best explained by pair reprocessing , because the major spectral variability was confined to a single rapid increase in the flux of markarian 766  ( after which it remained relatively constant ) , and because the soft excess is not required to fit the high count rate spectrum .",
    "this would be expected if the energies of the relativistic electrons were to increase suddenly : the first order pair reprocessed spectrum ( seen as the soft excess ) is replaced by a non - linear pair cascade , which produces the @xmath40 power law spectrum .    however , from the _ rosat _",
    "observations it is clear that the soft excess _ does not _ disappear when the power law increases in flux and slope , as this would lead to exactly the opposite behaviour of @xmath41 from that seen in figs [ fig : varitemp ] to [ fig : varislope ] .",
    "if the spectral changes in a source of compactness @xmath39 are determined by pair reprocessing , the hard x  rays would be expected to vary @xmath42 half a light crossing time before the soft x  rays ( done & fabian 1989 ) . assuming 1000s as the light crossing time for markarian 766",
    "this delay is @xmath0 500s .",
    "this should lead to a significant asymmetry in the cross correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig : ccor ] such that changes in the r7 band ( and to a lesser extent r4 band ) lead the changes in the r1l band .",
    "no such asymmetry is seen ( the dcf from observation p1 is asymmetric in the opposite sense ) .",
    "if the power law component is produced by relativistic particles scattering soft photons and pairs are not important , then changes in the power law component may be simultaneous at all energies .",
    "if the variability of the power law component is driven by changes in the number of soft seed photons ( i.e. variability of the soft excess ) then this could explain the apparent asymmetry , with soft flux leading the hard flux , in the cross correlation of observation p1 .",
    "however , in current models ( e.g. torricelli - ciamponi & courvoisier 1995 ) , the change in spectral index with power law flux is brought about by a change in the relativistic electron energy spectrum , not a change in the number of soft photons , and hence there is no expectation that the soft flux should change first .",
    "this would explain how the power law varies when there is no detectable soft excess variability , and is consistent with the behaviour of @xmath17 in all the observations .",
    "the low variability amplitude in the r1l band compared to the harder r4 and r7 bands ( see table [ tab : variamp ] ) would suggest that the soft excess is relatively invariant on short time scales compared to the power law component .",
    "this suggests that the soft excess and power law are different components , and hence a pair reprocessing origin for the soft excess is not likely .",
    "the relative invariance of the soft excess also rules out models whereby the soft excess is power law emission reflected or reprocessed close to the central regions .",
    "however , if the soft excess were power law emission reprocessed at regions some distance ( light days or more ) from the central regions , then the soft excess variability would be smeared out by the long response ; such a model is therefore compatible with the _ rosat _  data .",
    "the lack of short term soft excess variability is consistent with the it being part of the big blue bump , which is known to have a longer variability time scale than the power law x  ray emission in radio quiet agn ( e.g. ngc4051 , done et al .",
    "the soft excess spectrum is well fit by one or two black bodies , and hence is consistent with the shape expected from the high energy tail of a hot accretion disk ( e.g. ross , fabian & mineshige 1992 . )",
    "it is not possible to determine if the soft excess of markarian 766  varies over a longer time scale than an observation ; different values for the blackbody parameters are obtained from different observations , but the difference in off - axis angles between the observations , and the gain drift of the _ rosat _  pspc , mean that long term soft excess variability can not be assessed with any certainty .",
    "we note that the results presented here , i.e. that short term variability in the soft excess component is not detected , are in marked contrast with the findings of molendi & maccacaro ( 1994 ) .",
    "their study of markarian 766   is based on observation p2 , in which they find that the soft excess varies with the power law component by approximately the same amplitude , and hence that the two components are related to the same physical process or are causally connected . however , they determine the blackbody and power law parameters by fitting models to spectra in four states defined by overall count rate .",
    "they do not quote uncertainties on the power law and blackbody normalizations ; the apparent correlation between blackbody and power law normalization may be caused by the coupled nature of the blackbody temperature and power law slope when fitting low resolution _ rosat _",
    "the three colour data ( see fig . [ fig:3countrates ] ) , and lower variability amplitude in r1l than the r4 and r7 ( table [ tab : variamp ] ) , for all the _ rosat _  observations , including p2 , show that the blackbody flux _ can not _ vary as much as the power law flux .",
    "consequently , the model presented by molendi & maccacaro whereby changes in the accretion rate of an accretion disk determine the variability time scales in the _ rosat _  band is not valid , because the soft excess , assumed to be the high energy tail of an accretion disk , probably does not vary with the time scales found in the _ rosat _  lightcurve .",
    "galactic black hole candidates ( gbhcs ) have x  ray spectra that are qualitatively similar ( power law component with a soft excess , an fe line and reflection hump ) , to those of seyfert 1 galaxies . both types of objects",
    "are thought to be powered by accretion onto a black hole , and it is possible that the physical processes which produce x  ray emission are the same in both types of objects .",
    "gbhcs have two states : in the ` low ' state they have hard ( @xmath43 ) power law spectra with low energy ( @xmath44 kev ) soft excesses and in the ` high ' state they have steep power law components ( @xmath45 ) and powerful soft excesses which dominate the spectra below @xmath0 8 kev ( ebisawa et al . 1996 ) . in the low state ,",
    "gbhcs exhibit very rapid ( millisecond ) variability of the power law component , but vary less rapidly when they are in the high state .    the connection between gbhcs and seyfert 1 galaxies has been strengthened by the discovery that re j1034 + 396 has an extremely powerful soft excess , a steeper power law component than most seyfert 1s , and does not vary rapidly , i.e. it is like a gbhc in a high state ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) . in this analogy , markarian 766   is equivalent to a low state gbhc in that it shows continuous variability of the power law component , the spectral index of which is similar to those found in low state gbhcs .",
    "the variability time scales of gbhcs are much smaller than those of seyfert galaxies like markarian 766 , but this is not surprising given the large difference in the central black hole masses and hence overall dimensions inferred for seyfert nuclei and gbhcs .",
    "it is believed that the soft excess in the gbhc cygnus x-1 comes from a region of larger spatial extent ( and hence varies on a longer time scale ) than that producing the power law emission ( done et al .",
    "1992b ) ; the results presented here show that the same is probably true for markarian 766 .",
    "furthermore , changes in the soft x - ray flux in cygnus x-1 lead changes in the hard x  ray flux ( miyamoto & kitamoto 1989 ) , which may be true also for markarian 766   in observation p1 ( see section [ sec : crosscorrelation ] ) .",
    "note that ultrasoft spectra ( _ rosat _",
    "@xmath46 ) are not found in seyfert 1s with broad lines ( fwhm @xmath4 3000 km s@xmath6 , boller , brandt and fink 1996 ) , i.e. the broad line seyfert 1s are only analogous to gbhcs in the low state .",
    "however , _ both _",
    "gbhc states are represented among the nls1s .",
    "markarian 766   has one of the hardest _ rosat _  spectra of the nls1s in the sample of boller , brandt and fink ( 1996 ) .",
    "indeed , some nls1 galaxies have x  ray spectra so soft that they are quite unlike that of markarian 766   ( e.g. wpvs 007 , grupe et al .",
    "1995 , re j1034 + 396 , puchnarewicz et al .",
    "it is therefore important to question whether the x  ray emission observed in the ultrasoft nls1s could come from the same physical processes as that observed in the very much harder nls1s like markarian 766 .",
    "variability and spectral properties are important diagnostics ; similar physical processes can be expected to produce similar spectral shapes and similar variability characteristics .",
    "the results presented here show that the x  ray spectrum of markarian 766   has two important x  ray emission components ( the power law and soft excess ) which have different spectral shapes and different variability properties : a power law component which varies rapidly ( thousands of seconds ) and is softer when it is brighter , and a soft excess which does not exhibit any measurable rapid variability .",
    "nls1 galaxies which do not have extremely soft _ rosat _",
    "spectra might be expected to be most similar to markarian 766 .",
    "the best studied of these at x ",
    "ray wavelengths are ngc4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 . in",
    "both these agn the power law component shows rapid ( hundreds of seconds ) variability , and becomes softer as it increases in flux .",
    "this variability is found in _",

    "1990 , kunieda et al .",
    "1992 , pounds , turner & warwick 1986 ) , i.e. has continued for a number of years .",
    "this is exactly the behaviour found in markarian 766 .",
    "the ultra - soft nls1 galaxies show a more varied picture ; some like re j1034 + 396 show no significant rapid variability in either power law or soft excess components ( pounds , done & osborne 1995 ) , while iras 13224 - 3809 ( otani et al .",
    "1996 , boller et al .",
    "1993 ) shows extremely rapid variability involving both soft excess and power law components and phl 1092 ( forster & halpern 1996 ) shows rapid variability of at least the soft excess component .",
    "other ultra - soft objects have shown extreme variations in their soft excess over a relatively long time scale ( e.g. the _ rosat_count rate of re j1237 + 264 varied by a factor of @xmath0 70 between two observations separated by one year with no measurable spectral change , and the _ rosat _  count rate of wpvs 007 varied by a factor of @xmath47 in one year ) .",
    "boller , brandt & fink ( 1996 ) concluded that nls1s in general show considerable rapid variability , as well as softer than average _ rosat _",
    "it has often been assumed that the variability comes from the soft excess in these objects ( a natural assumption given that nls1s as a class are unusual in showing both large soft excesses and rapid soft x ",

    "note that the data in this plot are not simultaneous , the optical and ultraviolet spectra have not been dereddened , and the model x  ray spectrum has not been adjusted for absorption by neutral material .",
    "markarian 766  has a large _",

    "the spectrum is unusual among seyfert 1 galaxies in that it shows no evidence for the big blue bump in the ultraviolet .",
    "this has been noticed before by walter & fink ( 1993 ) in that markarian 766   has an unusually low ratio of ultraviolet to soft x ",

    "ray spectral slopes . of these five , one is the broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ic4329a , in which the lack of ultraviolet flux is probably caused by attenuation by dust in the edge on host galaxy .",

    "even with an edge to represent absorption from o vii and o viii , the underlying spectra in these two objects are unusually steep ( @xmath55 ) , suggesting that they _ do _ have soft excesses .",
    "the very similar multiwavelength spectra and x  ray properties in these objects probably mean that they lack ultraviolet flux for a common reason .",
    "attributing the lack of ultraviolet flux to reddening by dust in the line of sight is an attractive solution .",
    "optical polarization of markarian 766 , of @xmath56 increasing to the blue , indicates scattering from dust grains .",
    "these dust grains are probably located within the narrow line region , because the broad lines show more polarization than the narrow lines ( goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "for markarian 766 , the required amount of reddening to make the ultraviolet flux match the walter & fink ( 1993 ) ultraviolet  soft x  ray relation is consistent with its high balmer decrement ( @xmath57 ) seen in the optical spectrum .",
    "this amount of reddening is about twenty times that expected for a galactic gas to dust ratio and the measured cold absorbing column of @xmath58 ( walter & fink 1993 ) .",
    "this is reasonable if the dust is located in the narrow line region where hydrogen and helium will be predominantly ionized .",
    "the cross section for photoelectric absorption by metals in dust grains can be much smaller than for metals in the gas phase because of self blanketing ( e.g. fireman 1974 states that the 0.3 kev photoelectric cross section for 0.6 @xmath59 radius dust grains is only @xmath60 its value for gaseous metals . )",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn from polarization properties and balmer decrements of iras 13349 + 2438 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( wills et al .",
    "1992 , thomson & martin 1988 ) .    thermal emission from dust is also probably the best explanation of the large _",
    "iras  _ bumps in these objects .",
    "a large excess of 10 - 100 micron emission appears to be a common property in many nls1 galaxies , including those which are ultrasoft such as re j1034 + 396 ( puchnarewicz et al . 1995 ) .",
    "detailed sub - millimetre observations of the nls1 1zw1 indicate that the iras bump is well fitted by thermal emission from dust , but is poorly fitted by synchrotron models ( hughes , et al .",
    "the evidence for dust in these objects is extremely strong , _ even if _ the deficit of ultraviolet flux is related to unusually high big blue bump temperatures .",
    "it is therefore likely that dusty seyfert 1 galaxies are preferentially those which have narrow lines .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the only five seyfert 1s of the walter & fink ( 1993 ) sample to show evidence for dust reddening have narrow lines .",
    "it is further supported by the large ratio of narrow to broad line seyfert 1s found in _",
    "iras  _ surveys ( @xmath4 20% in the _",
    "iras  _ samples of spinoglio & malkan 1989 and osterbrock & derobertis 1985 ) and small ratio ( @xmath61 ) of narrow to broad line seyfert 1s found in optical surveys ( stephens 1989 ) .",
    "finally , in the unified model for agn , seyfert 2 galaxies are seyfert 1 galaxies viewed side - on , such that the broad line regions are obscured from us . the hidden broad line regions ( and seyfert 1 type optical continua ) of seyfert 2",
    "galaxies can be seen in polarized light .",
    "this is scattered into our line of sight by free electrons , which scatter optical light more or less independently of wavelength , or dust , which scatters blue light much more than red light ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "if more dust is found beyond the broad line region in nls1s than in broad line seyfert 1s , we would expect those seyfert 2s which have the largest red - blue polarization gradient to have hidden broad line profiles like those of nls1s .",
    "the numbers and qualities of spectropolarimetric observations of seyfert 2 galaxies are not sufficient to address this issue quantatively , but this hypothesis is qualitatively supported : of the miller & goodrich ( 1990 ) sample of eight highly polarized seyfert 2 galaxies , one ( ngc7674 ) has nls1 width polarized broad and components , and this object also has the highest red - blue polarization gradient .",
    "we have examined the variable soft x  ray emission of markarian 766   using hardness ratios and spectral analysis of 9 _ rosat _  datasets .",
    "the spectrum is well described by a power law and a blackbody ( kt @xmath62 ev ) soft excess .",
    "modeling of 31 spectra at different count rates and from different observations is consistent with a variable power law component , which is softer when it is brighter , and an unchanging black body soft excess .",
    "hardness ratios and variability amplitudes in three energy bands are in agreement with this picture , showing that the power law component varies continuously on a time scale of @xmath63s but the soft excess component probably does not vary significantly within the observations .",
    "this variability can be explained if the power law is produced by thermal or non - thermal comptonization of soft photons . while pair reprocessing could produce the correlation between power law spectral index and flux ,",
    "delays expected between changes in the hard and soft flux are not seen .",
    "the behaviour of markarian 766   is highly analogous to that of galactic black hole candidates in the low state , which have rapidly variable power law components and less variable ( extended ) soft excesses .    the time scale for variation in the _ rosat _  band probably provides an upper limit for the size of the region in which the power law ( but not necessarily the soft excess ) is produced .",
    "this means that the physical size of the soft excess region may be much larger than the x  ray power law producing region , and hence is consistent with the soft excess having similar variability time scales to the ultraviolet part of the big blue bump .",
    "markarian 766   is known to have a deficit of ultraviolet flux relative to its x  ray emission .",
    "we show that the four other objects in the walter & fink ( 1993 ) sample of _ rosat _",
    "all sky survey selected seyfert 1 galaxies , which show a lack of ultraviolet emission ( excluding ic4329a which is probably strongly absorbed by its edge - on host galaxy ) have very similar infrared to x  ray flux distributions to markarian 766 .",

    "we argue that the multiwavelength flux distributions of these objects support the walter & fink suggestion that the ultraviolet flux deficit is related to dust extinction , and show that other independent data are consistent with a picture in which nls1s have more dust in their narrow line regions than broad line seyfert 1s .",

    "<S> spectral modeling of 31 spectra from different observations and at a range of count rates is also consistent with a picture in which the power law is steeper when it is brighter , and in which the soft excess component does not vary . the power law variability can be explained if the power law is produced by variable thermal or non - thermal comptonization of soft photons . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is similar to that of galactic black hole candidates in the low state . </S>",
    "<S> the x  ray and multiwavelength properties of markarian 766   are shown to be very similar to those of other narrow line seyfert 1s . </S>",
    "<S> this may mean that the rapid x  ray variability seen in other narrow line seyfert 1s may also not originate in their strong soft excess components .    </S>",
