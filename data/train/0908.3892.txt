    "despite years of effort , the identity of dark matter ( dm ) is still unknown . for a review of the evidence for dm ,",
    "possible dm candidates , and detection techniques , see @xcite . here , we will be concerned with direct dm detection .",
    "most direct searches for dm consider the case where a dm particle scatters elastically off of standard model ( sm ) particles . as",
    "dm is nonrelativistic , @xmath6 , the momentum transferred in these interactions is small ; for a dm particle with mass @xmath7 gev scattering off a @xmath8 gev nucleus , the momentum transfer is of order @xmath8 mev . here",
    ", we point out that a similar momentum transfer could occur for much lighter dm particles , if they annihilate with sm particles into final - state particles with a lower rest mass .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to suspect that rather different mass scales could be probed with the same experiments . for illustration",
    ", we take the interaction @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are sm particles ( such as nuclei or nucleons ) , @xmath1 is a dm particle ( for this paper , taken to be fermionic ) , and @xmath12 is some particle which could be either contained in the sm or from new physics ( np ) , but with @xmath13 . in this case , the kinetic energy of the initial - state @xmath1 is negligible , but the rest mass @xmath14 is converted into kinetic energy of the final - state products . if we take @xmath14 to be @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the momentum transfer can be similar to that of the more standard case given above .",
    "this thus begs the question of whether or not current experiments could be used to rule out dm particles which are very light , but which interact with sm particles via ( [ eq : proc ] ) .",
    "recently , there has been much interest in the observability of models with `` hidden '' sectors @xcite , where new particles exist with masses similar to those of the sm fields , but whose interactions with sm particles are mediated by very heavy particles and , thus , strongly suppressed . in this work ,",
    "we consider a light ( here , taken to be below the weak scale ) dm particle @xmath1 interacting via the process ( [ eq : proc ] ) for the case where @xmath1 is fermionic .",
    "we take @xmath1 to belong to a `` hidden '' sector , i.e. , its interactions with sm particles are suppressed by either a high mass scale @xmath4 or by a very small coupling . although one could consider the case where @xmath12 is a hidden - sector particle or a neutrino , for simplicity , we consider only dark matter that interacts with sm particles through charged - current interactions , i.e. , @xmath12 is a charged , visible sm particle ; specifically , for this work , we will assume that @xmath12 is an electron .",
    "anticipating results which will see in section [ sec : dm ] , the least - constrained range of dm mass is @xmath17 .",
    "although we will review the current constraints on mev - scale dm in section [ sec : dm ] , we point out here that dm in this mass range can have an acceptable lifetime and relic density and remain compatible with a wide variety of observational constraints .",
    "the possible range for @xmath14 raises the possibility that the processes @xmath18 and @xmath0 could be seen in present - day neutrino detectors which search for neutrinos with energies of @xmath19 s of mev .",
    "it is the observability of @xmath0 which we explore in this paper ; we will specifically examine constraints obtainable from the search for relic neutrinos from supernovae performed by super - kamiokande @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the process @xmath0 from a model - independent standpoint via effective operators .",
    "we do this for two reasons .",
    "first , we choose the process @xmath0 based on its experimental observability ; as its experimental signature is very similar to sm neutrino interactions , this process can be studied with present - day neutrino experiments .",
    "second , little is known of the identity ( or identities ) of dark matter or of possible interactions within the `` dark sector '' or between dark matter and sm particles ; these interactions may turn out to be highly complicated and not well - described by any current model . given these considerations , we feel that any plausible method of direct detection of dark matter should be investigated , and that a model - independent analysis is in order .",
    "we point out that our work is somewhat similar in spirit to works on inelastic dm @xcite , but with a few important differences .",
    "first , the range of dm mass which we consider is very different , @xmath15 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "second , we consider dm which scatters to a lower - mass state ; in our case , this lower - mass state is an sm particle .",
    "lastly , we point out that in this work , we need not assume that elastic interactions such as @xmath21 are suppressed ; they could occur , but would have momentum transfers of @xmath22 , and thus typical proton recoil energies of @xmath23 , below the energy threshold of neutrino experiments .",
    "although the inelastic interaction @xmath24 could occur with a sizeable momentum transfer , the operators which we study in section [ sec : dm ] which contribute to this process turn out to be severely constrained . and non - sm right - handed neutrino fields . ]",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ops ] , we give the basis of operators which can contribute to the process @xmath0 .",
    "we derive constraints from dm lifetime in [ sec : dm ] , where we find that most of the operators are tightly constrained , but that the process @xmath0 can still occur if the dm mass is @xmath25 . given this result , we then review the existing constraints on mev dm . in section [ sec : nus ]",
    ", we then give the scattering cross - section and give limits on the operator contributing to this process from the super - k relic supernova neutrino search .",
    "for the majority of this work , we consider only the case where the sm lepton and quark fields are from the first generation .",
    "however , in section [ sec : collflav ] , we discuss how our results change if we consider the same operators , but with different flavors for the quark and lepton fields ; we also briefly mention issues involved in relating our results to specific models .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] , we conclude .",
    "in this section , we enumerate our operator basis . first , we summarize our notation .",
    "we denote the lepton and quark doublets of the sm by @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding sm right - handed singlet fields will be denoted as @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "we denote the higgs doublet as @xmath31 , and define @xmath32 . for now , we take all quark and lepton fields to be from the first generation ; we delay discussion of other quark and lepton flavors to section [ sec : collflav ] .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider only fermionic ( majorana or dirac ) dm particles , which we will denote as @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that @xmath1 is a singlet under the sm gauge group , @xmath33 .",
    "we consider operators of dimension six or less which are @xmath33-invariant and can contribute to the process @xmath34 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are all sm particles .",
    "additionally , we require that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are _ visible _ sm particles , i.e. not neutrinos . due to the tight constraints on proton decay",
    ", we do not consider operators which violate baryon number .",
    "this limits our current work to only the processes @xmath35 and @xmath36 and , thus , we concentrate on the process @xmath37 .",
    "although one could consider processes with both visible sm particles and additional invisible , non - sm particles in the final state , we do not consider that case here .",
    "thus , we consider operators which contain exactly one non - sm @xmath1 field .",
    "we eliminate redundant operators using integration by parts and the equations of motion for the fields ; although @xmath1 may have mass or yukawa - like couplings to other non - sm particles , we can still use its equation of motion to eliminate operators containing @xmath38 in favor of the operators appearing below or operators which do not contribute to the processes we are interested in here .    at dimension four , there is only one operator , @xmath39 ; this operator contributes at tree level to neutrino mass , however , and is thus severely constrained .",
    "all operators of dimension five can be eliminated by integration by parts and the equations of motion of the fields .",
    "thus , we consider operators of dimension six .",
    "again , we ignore operators which are constrained at tree level by neutrino mass . with these restrictions ,",
    "we are left with six operators @xmath40 these operators are all suppressed by @xmath41 , where @xmath4 is some mass taken to be higher than the weak scale , and each operator @xmath42 is multiplied by a coefficient @xmath43 .",
    "note that in all of these operators , @xmath1 is right - handed .",
    "although @xmath1 has the same quantum numbers as those of a right - handed neutrino , we do not , at this stage , require @xmath1 to have any specific interactions , such as a coupling to a right - handed @xmath44 , other than those specified above . for simplicity , we will neglect the possibility that @xmath1 interacts through more than one of the above operators simultaneously .",
    "having enumerated the operators @xmath42 which can contribute to @xmath0 , we now wish to place constraints on their coefficients divided by square of the new physics scale , @xmath45 . in order for @xmath1 to be dm ,",
    "it must be sufficiently long lived ; its lifetime must be at least of the order of the age of the universe ( @xmath46 s ) , and it must decay to visible products sufficiently slowly to have not yet been detected .",
    "we consider the constraints from dm lifetime on each of these operators in turn .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath47 contributes to the decay @xmath48 at tree level ; @xmath49 where @xmath50 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "in order for @xmath1 to have a lifetime comparable to the age of the universe , @xmath51 gev .",
    "however , for @xmath1 to be observable via the processes @xmath18 or @xmath0 at neutrino experiments , its mass must be at least a significant fraction of an mev @xcite .",
    "we obtain @xmath52    the insistence of a long lifetime for dm is clearly quite constraining .",
    "however , an even stronger limit on @xmath53 is possible , using the results of @xcite , who use limits on @xmath2-ray emission from the galactic center determined by integral @xcite and measurements of the diffuse @xmath2-ray background from integral @xcite , comptel @xcite and egret @xcite to constrain the lifetime of dm decaying to two daughter particles , one of which is a photon .",
    "they find that the dm lifetime must be @xmath54 for a dm mass between @xmath55 mev and @xmath56 gev , with even tighter constraints toward the lower end of this range and down to @xmath57 mev .",
    "thus , we obtain a limit on @xmath53 more than two orders of magnitude stronger than that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ownum1 ] ) , @xmath58 , a scale clearly inaccessible at neutrino experiments or collider experiments such as lhc .",
    "we note in passing that , although not interesting for current neutrino experiments , masses as low as @xmath59 kev are allowed for fermionic dark matter @xcite .",
    "however , limits from @xcite constrain the lifetime of dm particles to be orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe for dm masses as low as @xmath60 kev , implying that for even very light @xmath61 dm , the effects of @xmath62 would be undetectable at both neutrino experiments and at lhc .",
    "@xmath63 after electroweak symmetry breaking the higgs field @xmath31 obtains a vacuum expectation value , and @xmath63 takes on the effective form @xmath64 if @xmath65 mev , this allows the decay @xmath66 at tree level .",
    "for the range of @xmath14 valid for the constraints from super - kamiokande which we will consider in section [ sec : nus ] , the electron and positron masses can be neglected , and @xmath63 gives the @xmath1 a decay width of @xmath67 requiring this to be less than @xmath68 gev and taking @xmath69 few mev , we obtain @xmath70 with even stronger limits for larger values of @xmath14 . thus , we see that the effects of @xmath63 are out of reach for current - day neutrino and collider experiments for @xmath71 mev .",
    "however , even stronger limits are possible ; @xcite compute the decay width of an arbitrary dm particle to @xmath72 using the 511 kev line measured by integral .",
    "for the case where @xmath1 comprises all dm , and where its decays are responsible for the 511 kev line , their result corresponds to a lifetime @xmath73 of @xmath74 this gives @xmath75 from which one can see a linear dependence of the np scale on @xmath14 .",
    "we note , however , that , taken as limits on the new physics scale , these numbers are probably rather conservative . as discussed briefly below , @xcite and @xcite conclude that the 511 kev line can be produced only by processes in which the injection energy of the positrons was less than @xmath76 or @xmath77 mev , respectively .",
    "therefore , we note that , for example , if @xmath1 decays via @xmath63 were responsible for @xmath78 of the 511 kev flux , this would tighten the limits on the scale of new physics @xmath4 by a factor of @xmath79",
    ".    we will now use the very tight constraints for @xmath63 and @xmath62 to place constraints on the remaining operators .",
    "@xmath80 if @xmath81 , @xmath80 gives the decay @xmath82 at tree level .",
    "thus , we consider the case where @xmath83 ; here , @xmath1 can decay as @xmath84 via the mixing of @xmath80 into @xmath63 shown in the diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : oneloop ] .",
    "we note that both quark fields in @xmath80 are right - handed .",
    "thus , the mixing of @xmath80 into @xmath63 must be suppressed by the @xmath85 and @xmath86 masses as both quarks must flip chirality to interact with the @xmath87 .",
    "the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : oneloop ] is logarithmically divergent ; we thus estimate the mixing of @xmath80 into @xmath63 as @xmath88 we obtain results of @xmath89 for @xmath14 in the range which will be relevant for the limits from super - k discussed in section [ sec : nus ] . here , like in the case of @xmath63 , we see a linear dependence of the np scale on @xmath14 . we have taken the values of the light quark masses from @xcite ; given the uncertainty in these quantities , the error on our estimates of the np scale should be taken as on the order of @xmath90 .     into @xmath63 . ]    however , this expression does not accurately describe contributions from small ( @xmath91 ) internal loop momenta . for this region ,",
    "we instead calculate the contribution from a diagram where the internal @xmath85 and @xmath86 quarks are replaced by a virtual @xmath92 .",
    "the amplitude squared for this diagram is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the fermi constant , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the pion decay constant , @xmath97 mev .",
    "note that this expression contains factors of @xmath14 and @xmath98 , analogous to the lepton mass dependence that results in the usual sm @xmath92 decay helicity suppression .",
    "thus , if the decay channel @xmath99 is open , the constraints on @xmath100 will be substantially stronger .",
    "however , for @xmath101 , the contribution to @xmath102 from the diagram containing a virtual @xmath92 gives the differential cross - section @xmath103 which yields the limits @xmath104 these results are somewhat less restrictive than the result obtained via the loop diagram in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovr15 ] ) .",
    "thus , we take our results in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovr15 ] ) as our approximte limits on the np scale .",
    "given that @xmath80 is substantially more weakly constrained than the previous two operators , it is fruitful to look for other possible constraints . first , we consider the possible decay @xmath105 via the mixing of @xmath80 into @xmath47 .",
    "we note that @xmath80 does not mix into @xmath47 at one - loop order .",
    "example diagrams of the contribution to @xmath48 at two - loop order are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] ; however , this contribution is much weaker than the one - loop result for @xmath84 , due to an extra suppression from the electron mass ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] ( a ) , this is due to an electron chirality flip , while in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] ( b ) , it is due to a coupling of the electron to the higgs field .",
    "we also estimate a limit on the np scale by the contribution of @xmath80 to @xmath1 decay via @xmath106 mixing .",
    "this can occur through the diagrams similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] , but with the external photon removed .",
    "the diagram similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop ] ( b ) is quadratically divergent , and , thus , the contribution to an effective @xmath107 mass term is of order @xmath108 as we have cut off the quadratically divergent integral at @xmath109 and taken @xmath110 .",
    "we expect the mixing angle between the @xmath1 and @xmath111 to be of order @xmath112 .",
    "this mixing allows the decays @xmath113 and @xmath114 via couplings to the sm @xmath115 or @xmath87 , suppressed by the square of the mixing angle .",
    "thus , we expect the lifetime of the @xmath1 to be of order @xmath116 ( where @xmath117 is the @xmath118 lifetime ) , longer than the requirement stated earlier of @xmath119 .    finally , for comparison , we can also consider constraints from @xmath120 decay , as @xmath80 would contribute to @xmath121 .",
    "searches for heavy neutrinos in @xmath120 decay for @xmath122 mev @xcite give constraints on @xmath100 of order @xmath123 .",
    ", @xmath124 , @xmath125 into @xmath47 at two - loop order.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 operators @xmath124 and @xmath125 do not mix into @xmath47 or @xmath63 at one - loop order .",
    "they can be inserted into diagrams like that in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop](a ) to give @xmath48 .",
    "( diagrams which contain a higgs , such as in fig . [ fig : twoloop](b ) , will be suppressed by additional powers of small yukawa couplings . )",
    "as these operators contain only one right - handed sm field , there are contributions with suppression by only one power of a light mass ; we give an order - of - magnitude estimate for the mixing into @xmath62 : @xmath127 for @xmath128 mev , in order for @xmath1 to satisfy the @xmath2-ray constraints , we must have @xmath129 with tighter constraints for larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "this implies the order - of - magnitude limit @xmath130    @xmath131 , on the other hand , mixes into @xmath62 at one - loop order and will be more strongly constrained than @xmath125 and @xmath124 .",
    "we thus find that @xmath125 , @xmath124 , and @xmath131 to be very tightly constrained , likely beyond the reach of near - future experiments .",
    "given the above constraints , we concentrate for the rest of this work on the operator @xmath80 and restrict ourselves to the mass range @xmath83 .",
    "it is appropriate at this stage to review the motivation for , and the existing constraints on , dm with a mass of order @xmath132 mev .",
    "although some supersymmetry - inspired models of mev dm exist @xcite , its original motivation has been the proposal @xcite that mev dm annihilating to @xmath72 could explain the 511-kev line from the galactic bulge observed by integral @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued @xcite that searches for 511-kev emissions from dm - rich dwarf spheriodals @xcite would provide very compelling evidence for annihilating dm .",
    "however , it has been shown @xcite that in - flight positron annihilations on electrons in the intersteller medium would over - produce galactic @xmath2 rays unless their injection energy was @xmath133 mev , severely restricting the range of dm masses compatible with the 511 kev line .",
    "a similar analysis @xcite obtained an upper limit of @xmath134 mev ; see also @xcite .",
    "while this makes the case for mev - scale dm less observationally motivated , it merely constrains the annihilation of dm to @xmath72 at late times , not the _ existence _ of mev - scale dm .",
    "therefore , we will relax the requirement that mev - scale dm be responsible for the observed 511-kev line , and consider the entire possible mass range @xmath83 .    with any dm candidate ,",
    "its present - day relic density must be compatible with observation .",
    "the interaction @xmath80 is similar to that for a right - handed neutrino .",
    "as is well - known , the lee - weinberg bound @xcite requires that heavy neutrinos which annihilate through weak - scale intermediate gauge bosons have a mass @xmath135 in order to annhilate sufficiently to not overclose the universe .",
    "interactions suppressed by higher physics scales will freezeout earlier ; if these interactions dominate @xmath1 annihilations , @xmath1 will annihilate less completely , thus strengthening the lee - weinberg bound .",
    "thus , in order for @xmath1 to be a realistic dm candidate with @xmath83 , it must have at least one other interaction in addition to @xmath80 which is stronger than weak interactions .",
    "a number of works @xcite have studied interactions which can make the relic density of mev - scale dm agree with observation .",
    "if we assume that @xmath1 dominates the dark matter density , we must have a thermally - averaged cross - section for annihilation @xmath136 at freezeout of @xmath137 @xcite , where @xmath138 is the relative velocity of dm particles .",
    "however , if the primary annihilation channel during freezeout is @xmath139 , there is tension between the cross - section implied by the present - day relic density and the flux for the 511 kev line , if the cross - section is independent of velocity , i.e. , s - wave @xcite ; similar conclusions hold for gamma rays over a range of energies @xcite .",
    "however , if the cross - section is p - wave , with @xmath140 , these requirements can be brought into better agreement ; @xcite have suggested obtaining such behavior by coupling both dm particles and @xmath72 to a new , light u - boson .",
    "@xcite find that such a u - boson with an axial - vector coupling to a dm fermion , such as occurs for majorana dm particles , will either give a cross - section that is completely p - wave ( for a vector coupling to electrons ) or whose s - wave component is suppressed by the electron mass ( for an axial vector coupling to the electron ) .    here , as we wish to be model - independent , we will stick with the effective operator formalism ; for example , for a velocity - dependent annhilation to @xmath72 , we could introduce the operator @xmath141 where the @xmath28 fields are taken to be @xmath142 flavor . here , we do not take @xmath143 to be similar to the np scale @xmath4 for @xmath80 ; we take @xmath144 to be an effective operator valid at energies relevant for freezeout , @xmath145 , although one could consider processes mediated by intermediate particles which are sufficiently light that this approximation is not valid , if the intermediate particle , such as a u - boson , is very weakly coupled .",
    "we leave the investigation of how such an operator may arise for future work ; we make a few brief comments on model - building in section [ sec : collflav ] .",
    "taking @xmath146 at freezeout @xcite , and requiring the thermally - averaged annihilation cross - section @xmath136 to be @xmath147 , @xmath148 is of order @xmath149 for @xmath1 in the mass range of interest here .",
    "however , given the results of @xcite and @xcite which show that the 511 kev line can only be produced by annihilations of dm with very low mass , considering only annihlations to @xmath72 is not well - motivated .",
    "thus , we also consider the case where @xmath1 annihilates primarily to neutrinos .",
    "we can do this by introducing the operator @xmath150 or the same operator where the lepton fields are @xmath118 flavor .",
    "this operator allows the annihilations @xmath151 to both @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "however , for the mass range of interest here , @xmath154 mev , only the neutrino channel is open both during freezeout and for present - day annihilations ; in the case of the @xmath118-flavored operator , for @xmath155 , annihilations to muons may form some fraction of the cross - section @xcite .",
    "as before , relic density considerations require @xmath136 to be of order @xmath156",
    ". such an operator could again arise from the exchange of a light u - boson ; however , keeping to our model - independent philosophy , here we again only assume it to be some effective operator valid for energies @xmath145 . as @xmath157 does not contribute to the 511 kev line ,",
    "a velocity - independent cross - section is acceptable ; optionally , we could then add in other operators which could contribute to , but not fully explain , the 511 kev line , as long as they satisfy the requirements imposed by @xcite .",
    "upper limits on the velocity - averaged annihilation cross - section of dm to neutrinos for dm mass above @xcite and below @xcite @xmath158 mev are @xmath159 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "while these limits are not far from the required value for @xmath136 , this annihilation channel is not definitively ruled out .",
    "again , taking @xmath161 gives a physics scale for this operator of order several gev .",
    "there are also constraints on mev - scale dm from supernovae .",
    "@xcite placed limits on the interactions of right - handed neutrinos by requiring that they interact sufficiently strongly to become trapped and not cool the supernova too rapidly , contradicting observations from sn 1987a . here , in order to satisfy the relic density requirements , we assume that @xmath1 interacts with electrons and/or neutrinos with a strength much stronger than the weak interactions ; in this case , the @xmath1 is trapped . however ,",
    "if the interaction of the @xmath1 with neutrinos is too strong , it can make the neutrinos more trapped and cause the supernova to cool too slowly ; @xcite consider the case where a dm particle is strongly coupled to neutrinos and conclude that such a dm particle is ruled out if it has a mass @xmath162 mev and that this lower bound could be raised to as much as @xmath163 mev .",
    "the effects of mev dm on big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) have also been studied .",
    "@xcite consider dm coupled to neutrinos , electrons , and to both neutrinos and electrons simultaneously .",
    "they find , for the neutrino case , that dm particles of mass @xmath164 mev pose no problem for bbn .",
    "for the case where dm is coupled to electrons , they find that the cross - section necessary for the correct relic density is incompatible with bbn if the interaction is s - wave and the dm mass is between @xmath165 and @xmath166 mev .",
    "p - wave interactions , however , were still compatible .",
    "for the case where the dm particle was coupled to both electrons and neutrinos , they expected to have no discrepancy with bbn for a dm mass @xmath167 mev .",
    "finally , we note that the effects of mev dm for @xmath168 mev on the formation of small - scale structure has been studied in @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that fermionic dm with a mass @xmath169 is not definitively ruled out by any of the above considerations , although further investigation would require the formulation of a specific model .",
    "we now move on to calculating the interaction rate of such dm particles in super - k .",
    "we now discuss how the @xmath1 particle could be observed in neutrino experiments . for this purpose , we will focus on the relic supernova neutrino search using the process @xmath170 from super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "we consider this analysis as it covers a wide range of neutrino energy @xmath171 , and this range in @xmath171 can be translated into a range of possible values of @xmath14 in the process @xmath172 .",
    "super - kamiokande has placed a limit of @xmath173 @xmath174 on the relic antineutrino flux for @xmath175 .",
    "they fit the overall normalization of their backgrounds to data , as the energy distributions for their backgrounds and for their signal are sufficiently distinct ; as the electron in the process @xmath172 should be approximately monoenergetic with an energy of @xmath14 ( before being modulated by the detector resolution ) , we assume that this is a conservative estimate of how well this process could be distinguished from background . although it is possible that the difference between the shapes of the @xmath176 and @xmath177 energy distributions could result in our obtaining an overly optimistic limit on @xmath172 for specific values of @xmath14 , we would expect this would change the limit on the scale of new physics by at most a few tens of percent .    to calculate the interaction rate of @xmath177 at super - k",
    ", the first thing which we must know is the dm flux .",
    "the mass density of dm in our neighborhood is @xmath178 @xcite , and its velocity @xmath179 relative to the earth is @xmath180 ( for @xmath181)@xcite .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath177 constitutes all dm , the @xmath177 flux @xmath182 is @xmath183 for @xmath184 mev , respectively .",
    "thus , super - k can be sensitive to the process @xmath172 as long as its cross - section @xmath185 is @xmath186 times the sm neutrino cross - section evaluated at the neutrino energy @xmath187 .",
    "the relevant @xmath177 flux and corresponding sensitivity to @xmath185 are reduced by a factor of @xmath188 if @xmath1 and @xmath177 are present in equal numbers .",
    "next , we calculate the ratio of @xmath185 to the sm @xmath176 cross - section . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the electron mass , the proton - neutron mass difference , and the possibility of second - class currents .",
    "we only include terms leading order in @xmath189 ( and @xmath190 ) , where @xmath191 is the nucleon mass .",
    "these approximations should not change our values for the np scale by more than @xmath192 , which is adequate for our purposes .",
    "the cross - section @xmath185 is @xmath193 where @xmath194 and @xmath195 are the nucelon form factors @xcite . for the sm process",
    "@xmath170 we obtain , using expressions from @xcite , @xmath196 if we take the ratio of these two cross - sections with @xmath171 evaluated at @xmath14 and insist that this be less than @xmath197 , we find @xmath198 where , again , @xmath199 is the higgs vev and @xmath200 is in units of @xmath201 .",
    "this gives @xmath202 here , the accessible np scale is proportional to @xmath203 due to the dependence of the dm flux on @xmath14 .",
    "thus , we see that the reach of neutrino experiments can be quite strong ; for the mass range considered here , it gives limits on the np scale of order @xmath8 tev .",
    "a few notes about other possibly relevant experiments are in order .",
    "first , @xcite uses a calculation almost identical to ours to place limits on interactions of right - handed neutrino dm using ga @xcite and cl experiments @xcite .",
    "however , they considered the mass range @xmath204 mev , which is dominated by the solar neutrino background ; for this mass range , the limits on the new physics scale are thus substantially weaker .",
    "we also note that limits weaker than those above exist on the @xmath176 flux for energies below @xmath165 mev and as low as @xmath205 mev from super - k @xcite , kamland @xcite , and the borexino counting test facility @xcite ; the limits on the new physics scale for low values of @xmath14 from these experiments would be weaker than those obtained above by a factor approximately ranging between a few and an order of magnitude .",
    "also , we note that there exist limits on the relic supernova @xmath206 ( as opposed to the @xmath176 considered above ) flux from the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite and an analysis of the super - k data @xcite which are about two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the @xmath176 flux .",
    "constraints derived from the @xmath206 flux limits are relevant for the cases where 1 ) @xmath1 is a dirac fermion and we consider @xmath1 ( and not @xmath177 as considered above ) as our dm candidate , and 2 ) @xmath1 is majorana , in which case the flux limits on both @xmath206 and @xmath176 are constraining .",
    "we do not consider constraints derived from the @xmath206 flux here ; however , as the cross - section in neutrino detectors is proportional to @xmath207 , we would naively expect these constraints to translate into limits on the np scale which are weaker than those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : results ] ) by a factor of a few .",
    "finally , we note that facilities such as dusel @xcite or hanohano @xcite may improve somewhat on these limits in the future .",
    "having given our main results in section [ sec : nus ] , we now discuss a few issues related to our analysis",
    ".    we will first consider how our results change if we consider the same operators , but with fields which are not just from the first generation .",
    "first , we will consider the effects of changing the flavor on the quark fields in operators @xmath80 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "since nucleons are made of up and down quarks , we must have operators which contain quarks from the first generation in order to have contributions to @xmath208 .",
    "the right - handed quark fields in these operators must therefore be of the first generation , while the left - handed quark doublet fields can be of the second and third generation , as their lower components contain a down quark , suppressed by a cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix term .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath80 , other flavor structures are not relevant for this work . on the other hand , if we change the flavor of the left - handed quark doublet in @xmath125 , the limit which we derived by an estimate of the mixing of this operator into @xmath47 is no longer valid ; the logarithmically divergent part of fig .",
    "[ fig : twoloop](a ) is zero by the gim mechanism . for @xmath124 ,",
    "however , this diagram is merely ckm - suppressed ; the same is true of the one - loop mixing of @xmath126 into @xmath47 .",
    "it is possible , however , to arrange linear combinations of flavor structures for which these constraints no longer apply , but it would be unexpected that the np scale for the unconstrained flavor combinations is substantially lower than that of the flavor diagonal case where both quark fields are from the first generation .",
    "next , we consider the effects of changing lepton flavor . our constraints from @xmath1 lifetime for operators @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 are independent of the lepton mass , except that for @xmath118- and @xmath209-flavored operators , we are interested in higher values of @xmath14 ; therefore , changing the lepton flavor from @xmath142 to @xmath118 or @xmath209 will only result in stronger constraints . in the case of @xmath63 , if the lepton is @xmath118 flavor , @xmath1 can decay at tree level via @xmath210 as long as @xmath211 . however , as @xmath63 is purely charged - current , it can only contribute to neutrino experiments where a muon is produced in the final state , which , even neglecting detector thresholds , requires @xmath212 .",
    "a similar argument holds for the @xmath209 case .",
    "thus , this operator is not interesting for neutrino experiments , except perhaps for a very small range of @xmath14 , which we ignore here .",
    "next , we consider @xmath80 ; for simplicity , we will take the lepton field to be @xmath118 flavor .",
    "first , we note that @xmath1 can decay at tree level via @xmath213 if @xmath214 mev .",
    "thus we are interested in the mass range @xmath215 mev .",
    "our expression for the one - loop mixing of @xmath80 into @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ovr ] ) is independent of lepton flavor , so we expect the @xmath118 case to be similarly strongly constrained , except for a small mass range @xmath216 .",
    "however , there may be some tension with neutrino mixing , as the mixing term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : numix ] ) is dependent upon the lepton mass .",
    "the observability of @xmath1 in neutrino experiments for the mass range @xmath217 we leave for future work .",
    "we do not address the mass range @xmath218 for this case , as this is not relevant for neutrino experiments .",
    "some comments are also in order about the possible applicability of @xmath80 to specific models . here , we have taken @xmath1 to be a singlet under the sm . if we assume a single higgs doublet as in the sm , the quantum numbers of the fields in @xmath80 dictate that @xmath1 has the same quantum numbers as a right - handed neutrino , and that the interaction @xmath39 is not disallowed by any symmetry .",
    "this is problematic , as this operator would allow @xmath1 to mix with neutrinos and decay via @xmath219 . in order to prevent this",
    ", we must introduce a second higgs doublet and impose a symmetry which disallows @xmath39 .",
    "once this is done , interactions must be introduced to give @xmath1 an appropriate relic density . a complete investigation of these points , including whether or not any of the effective operators mentioned in section [ sec : dm ] to produce a reasonable relic density ( or additional operators not considered here , such as interactions coupling @xmath1 to quarks , or interactions involving very light intermediate particles where the effective operator formalism is not valid ) are generated at an appropriately low scale , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we observe , however , that @xmath80 appears similar to a right - handed neutrino interaction ; this may imply that left - right symmetric models could be an elightening place to begin constructing a model which contains @xmath80 as a low - energy approximation .",
    "finally , another point worth mentioning is that our above limits on the operator coefficients assume that @xmath1 is a dm particle .",
    "we have not made any statements on the observability of these operators , for example at lhc , if @xmath1 belongs to a hidden sector , but is not a constituent of dm .",
    "thus , the investigation of these interactions , including various flavor structures , at lhc could still be a worthy endeavour .",
    "in this work , we have considered the possibility that a light @xmath220 fermionic dm particle @xmath1 could be observed by direct detection in current - day neutrino experiments if it interacts inelastically through the process @xmath172 .",
    "we have approached this problem from a model - independent standpoint and constrained operators contributing to this process using the dm lifetime and its decays to @xmath221 and to @xmath222 , finding lower bounds on the new physics scale @xmath4 for most of the operators to be @xmath223 . finding the constraints on one operator @xmath80 substantially weaker than those on the other operators , we then used the results from the super - k relic supernova neutrino search to place limits on @xmath80 .",
    "we find that super - k was able to probe the scale of new physics up to @xmath5 , far beyond the reach of present - day or near - future colliders .",
    "given the impressive reach obtainable with super - k , it is worthwhile to consider possible extensions of this work not explored here .",
    "first , we have considered only charged - current interactions with nuclei ; neutral - current interactions such as @xmath224 and interactions with electrons could also be considered .",
    "also , if neutral - current interactions are considered , it is possible that , in addition to neutrino experiments , current direct - detection dm experiments designed to look for dm with masses of @xmath225 could be sensitive to much lighter dm interacting inelastically ; the relevance of such interactions to dama / nai has been explored in @xcite .",
    "finally , we have only considered fermionic dm ; one could also consider the cases of light dark scalars or light dark gauge bosons .",
    "the main point of our paper , however , is that inelastic interactions in which a dm particle annihilates into a particle with a smaller mass ( either an sm particle or another as - yet - unknown particle ) can occur , and that these interactions can be very sensitively probed by existing experiments .",
    "as we still know very little of the identity , or identities , of dm or how it interacts with itself or with `` regular '' matter , we should consider these possible interactions and investigate how existing constraints from neutrino experiments or experiments searching for elastically - interacting dm can be translated into constraints on more general scenarios .",
    "the authors would like to thank m. wise for his calculation of the decay width of @xmath84 , as well as numerous helpful comments and suggestions .",
    "they would also like to thank h. davoudiasl , s. dawson , s. gopalakrishna , w. marciano , c. sturm , and m. ramsey - musolf for extensive discussions and helpful advice .",
