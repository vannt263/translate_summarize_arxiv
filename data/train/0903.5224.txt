    "diffuse baryons and dark matter ( dm ) constitute the major components of clusters and groups of galaxies , with the former energized and shining by continual struggle against the latter .    the dm accounts for some @xmath13 of the total masses @xmath14 from poor groups to rich clusters , making for average densities @xmath15 g @xmath16 with its constituent ( ` collisionless ' ) particles entertaining little or no interactions other than gravity .",
    "thus the dm sets the overall gravitational wells virialized within radii @xmath17 up to a few mpcs , where all bodies in dynamical equilibrium @xmath18 from single particles to whole galaxies @xmath18 possess or acquire an @xmath19-d velocity dispersion @xmath20 km s@xmath21 .",
    "the bulk of the baryons , to a fraction again close to @xmath13 , is found in the diffuse form of a hot intracluster _ plasma _ ( the icp ) , mostly comprised of protons with the neutralizing electrons at number densities @xmath22 @xmath16 , and equilibrium temperatures @xmath23 kev ( @xmath24 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath25 the proton mass ) well above most ionization potentials .",
    "this we know since cavaliere et al .",
    "( 1971 ) found in the first _",
    "uhuru _ data clear evidence of a new class of bright x - ray extragalactic sources associated with the deep , stable gravitational wells of the galaxy systems , emitting from the icp they contain thermal bremsstrahlung powers @xmath26 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "the notion has been nailed down beyond all doubts by observations of the extended nature of these sources ( gursky et al .",
    "1972 ) and of high excitation , coronal - like lines ( mitchell et al . 1976",
    "; serlemitsos et al . 1977 ; see also sarazin 1988 ) that also pointed toward definite , somewhat subsolar metallicities .",
    "such temperatures and densities make the icp an extremely _ good _ plasma , in fact the best in the universe ever , as its constituent particles in the dm gravitational wells acquire a large kinetic relative to electrostatic energy ( at mean separations @xmath27 cm ) , their ratio being of order @xmath28 ; this astounding value is to be compared with its counterparts : @xmath29 in stellar interiors , or @xmath30 in the pre - recombination universe .",
    "this holds despite gravity being so exceedingly feeble at microscopic levels as to attain a mere @xmath31 of the strength that marks the electromagnetic interactions ; it holds because the plasma condition @xmath32 is dominated by the huge number @xmath33 expressing in proton units the total dm mass with its overwhelming gravity . as a result , the icp at microscopic scales constitutes a very _ simple _ , nearly perfect gas of particles with @xmath34 degrees of freedom and effective mass @xmath35 with @xmath36 . at intermediate scales of some @xmath37",
    "kpc these sense mostly the electromagnetic interactions ; by the latter the electrons absorb or emit radiation , while the protons share their energy over a mean free path @xmath38 kpc , with electrons following suit over some @xmath39 toward full thermal equilibrium .    by the same token , the macrophysics at cluster scales gets interestingly _ complex _ , as the icp constitutes a faithful _ archive _ preserving memory of the different energy inputs occurring throughout sizes of mpcs and over timescales of @xmath37 gyr .",
    "we shall see that the icp physics is governed , in a nutshell , by the interplay of electromagnetic interactions transferring energy to the plasma , and of the dm bulk gravity proceeding to blend and readjust it over cluster scales .    to disentangle these processes , it will prove technically convenient to use two synthetic and formally analogous quantities . as for the icp ,",
    "the adiabat @xmath40 is straightforwardly related to the thermodynamic specific entropy @xmath41 const . usually named ` entropy ' for short , this quantity is endowed with time - honored , effective properties like : increasing ( decreasing ) by energy gains ( losses ) other than adiabatic compressions ( expansions ) ; and controlling the icp settlement into gravitational wells .    as to the dm ,",
    "the analogous quantity @xmath42 is increasingly found to play @xmath18 in spite of all the traditional objections leveled to defining ` entropy ' in a collisionless medium dominated by long range self - gravity like the dm @xmath18 similar roles to a true entropy ; in fact , it increases during the fast collapse with associated major mergers that set up the halo bulk , and stays put during the subsequent slow mass accretion producing a quiet development of the outskirts from the inside out .",
    "these two stages have been recently recognized in sophisticated @xmath43-body simulations that follow the development of halos embedding galaxies or galaxy systems from initial cold dm perturbations ( e.g. , zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al . 2007 ) . from simulations , during quiet stages the simple powerlaw run @xmath44 is found to apply remarkably well with definite slopes close to @xmath45 throughout the structure s main body , as first stressed by taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) and confirmed by many others ( e.g. , dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ; hoffman et al . 2007 ; ascasibar & gottlber 2008 ; vass et al .",
    "2009 ; navarro et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we shall find these two entropies to be most useful in computing and relating the macroscopic , static equilibria of dm and baryons in the _ same _ gravitational wells as set by the former .",
    "this is perceived on just inspecting their related equilibrium conditions for the density runs @xmath4 and @xmath46 , namely , the hydrostatic vs. jeans equation in the form @xmath47 while the rich contents of the second equality have been discussed in detail by lapi & cavaliere ( 2009a [ hereafter lc09 ] , see also   2 for a recap ) , in the present paper we will focus on the first equation . to this purpose , we make use of a physical model for @xmath3 to derive the detailed pressure structure of the icp .",
    "our approach develops the line extensively pursued in the literature at increasingly sophisticated levels . a simple isothermal or polytropic state has been adopted by , e.g. , cavaliere & fusco - femiano ( 1976 , 1978 ) , balogh et al . ( 1999 ) , dos santos & dor ( 2002 ) , and ostriker et al .",
    "refined models were based on a more articulated entropy run , consisting of an outer ramp produced by _",
    "gravitational _ accretion shocks going on in the aftermath of cluster formation ( see tozzi & norman 2001 , voit et al . 2003 ,",
    "lapi et al .",
    "2005 [ hereafter lcm05 ] ) , plus a central entropy floor of _ nongravitational _ origin ( e.g. , babul et al .",
    "2002 ; voit et al . 2002 ; voit 2005 ) .",
    "the latter may be contributed by a number of processes : cooling that selectively removes some low - entropy gas from the inner regions ( see bryan 2000 ; voit & bryan 2001 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2004 ) ; preheating of the icp due to supernovae ( sne)/active galactic nuclei ( agns ) within the cluster progenitors ( see cavaliere et al .",
    "1997 ; lcm05 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2008 ) ; the direct action within the cluster of central agns ( valageas & silk 1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2000 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; lcm05 ) .",
    "additional gravitational events in the form of major mergers ( balogh et al . 2007 ; mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) that now and then punctuate the equilibrium state of formed clusters ( cavaliere et al . 1999 ) may reach down to the center and enhance the entropy there .",
    "here we improve over these previous studies in the following respects . as to the dm potential",
    "well , we adopt the physical @xmath2-profiles obtained from solving the jeans equation rather than assuming the empirical nfw fit ( see   2 ) . as to the icp equilibrium , we present a novel analytical solution for the icp density and temperature runs in terms of the icp entropy distribution ( see   3 ) . the distribution that we use",
    "comprises an outer ramp and a central floor , marked by two parameters physically assessed in terms of steady , self - similar accretion shocks plus additional energy inputs due to central agns and mergers ( see   3.1 ) .",
    "we insert the entropy distribution in our equilibrium solution to obtain the icp ` supermodel ' , that effectively represents with two icp parameters the extended profiles of the x - ray surface brightness and temperature for either classes : the cool core ( cc ) and the non cool core ( ncc ) clusters , see   4 .",
    "we discuss the stability against cooling and feedback of the ensuing central conditions ( see   5 ) .",
    "we recover classic models for the icp distribution of density and temperature as limiting cases of the supermodel valid in different radial ranges and for different central entropy levels ( see   6 ) .",
    "we provide specific predictions for future x - ray observations of the icp , and model - independent tests of the entropy runs underlying the icp supermodel ( see   7 ) .    throughout this work",
    "we adopt a standard , flat cosmology ( see spergel et al . 2007 ) with normalized matter density @xmath48 , dark energy density @xmath49 , and hubble constant @xmath50 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 .",
    "from lc09 we recall for use in the present paper a number of basic features in the equilibrium of the dm halos embedding the icp , as described by the jeans equation with entropy @xmath51 ( see   1 ) ; in compact form this reads @xmath52 with @xmath53 set to a constant , this yields the changing density slope @xmath54 in terms of the increasing ratio to @xmath55 of the halo circular velocity squared @xmath56 that provides normalization and running estimates for the gravitational potential .",
    "the above equation provides the detailed cluster gravitational well , within which the icp is to adjust .",
    "the _ physically _ relevant values of @xmath2 are pinned down from the structures cosmogonic development .",
    "based on the straightforward scaling laws @xmath57 and @xmath58 , it is seen that the entropy is to scale as @xmath59 , a run clearly implying a radial slope @xmath60 .",
    "the detailed time dependence of the accretion rate @xmath61 and the related quantities may be derived semianalytically within the standard @xmath62cdm cosmogony ; the result for the allowed range is @xmath63 from groups to massive clusters , narrowed down to @xmath64 for average masses @xmath65 from poor to rich clusters of main interest here . in the structure",
    "s development these values obtain at the transition epoch from the stage of fast collapse to that of slow accretion ( relative to the running hubble time ) , when the potential well attains its maximal depth marked by @xmath66 .",
    "such a two - stage development turns out to be in tune with the intensive , detailed @xmath43-body simulations recalled in   1 .",
    "in addition , the simulations support a value of @xmath2 in the range above , which stays put from the center throughout the halo bulk as the late quasi - equilibrium configuration develops from the inside out .",
    "these values may be inserted into the jeans equation , to find ( as pioneered by taylor & navarro 2001 and dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ) all the _ viable _ solutions for @xmath46 , that we name @xmath2-profiles and illustrate in fig .  1 . these feature a monotonic radial run satisfying physical central and outer boundary conditions , i.e. , zero gravitational force ( corresponding to a flat minimum of the potential ) and finite ( hence definite ) overall mass , respectively .",
    "the ensuing behavior of the @xmath2-profiles , basic to the icp equilibrium , is illustrated in the top panel of fig .  1 , and highlighted by the analytic expressions of the slopes @xmath67 these start from the central ( @xmath68 ) value @xmath69 , progressively steepen to @xmath70 at the point @xmath71 that marks the halo main body , and steepen further into the outskirts to the value @xmath72 at around the virial radius @xmath17 before going into a final cutoff .",
    "the @xmath2-profiles are seen ( see lc09 ) to correspond to a maximal value @xmath73 for the relative gravitational pull at the point @xmath74 where @xmath75 peaks ( see also bottom panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "after eq .",
    "( 3 ) this also implies at @xmath76 a maximal slope @xmath77 .    at variance with the empirical nfw formula ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) that features angled central potential or pressure and diverging mass , for the @xmath2-profiles the inner slope is considerably _ flatter _ , and the outer one is _ steeper _ as to result in a definite overall mass .",
    "the radial range @xmath78 where the density profile is steeper than a reference slope @xmath79 may be specified in terms of the usual concentration parameter @xmath80 , that may be viewed as a measure of central condensation and/or outskirts extension . in up - to - date numerical simulations",
    "( see zhao et al .",
    "2003 ; diemand et al .",
    "2007 ) this is found to take on value @xmath81 at the transition redshift @xmath82 , and to increase thereafter to current values @xmath83 up to @xmath84 for the fraction about @xmath85 of rich clusters with early transition epoch @xmath86 .",
    "instead , values @xmath87 apply to the much more numerous clusters with recent transition epochs .",
    "another basic feature of the @xmath2-profiles is provided by the _ peaked _ run of the gravitationally acquired dispersion @xmath88 see bottom panel of fig .  1 .",
    "towering above the central and the outer drops related to the cold nature of the dm , the peak results from the central rise of @xmath89 and the outer steep falloff of @xmath46 , and will have a striking counterpart in the icp .",
    "the characteristic values of @xmath90 for the @xmath2-profiles are set in terms of _ minimal _ values for @xmath91 ; this is related to limited randomization during accretion of the infall kinetic energy gained by the initially cold dm particles .",
    "these @xmath2-profiles actually depend weakly on @xmath2 in the named range ( see fig .  1 ) , and though derived from the isotropic jeans eq .",
    "( 3 ) prove to be _ stable _ against addition of reasonable anisotropies .",
    "the latter are described by the standard binney ( 1978 ) parameter @xmath92 , which numerical simulations suggest to increase outwards from central values @xmath93 meaning weakly tangential anisotropy , toward @xmath94 that implies prevailing radial motions ( see dehnen & mclaughlin 2005 ; hansen & moore 2006 ; also hst et al .",
    "such density profiles turn out to be slightly _ flattened _ at the center and considerably _ steepened _ into the outskirts .",
    "the @xmath2-profiles are also _ stable _ against educated variations in the condition @xmath95 const . actually , the cosmogonic buildup given by our semianalytic computation yields a slow decrease of @xmath96 into the outskirts , as these develop from the inside out at late times after the transition . again in keeping with the simulations , the outer development does not affect the inner gravitational potential and the equilibrium described by the jeans equation , that ( with its central boundary condition ) also works from the inside out .",
    "in fact , for the present use we have computed the density profiles associated with @xmath96 , and checked these to be very close to the parent @xmath2-profiles but for being somewhat steeper into the outskirts , with densities lower by about @xmath97 in the vicinity of the virial radius .",
    "it is to be stressed that the @xmath2-profiles for @xmath98 , especially with full @xmath96 and anisotropies , turn out to provide an optimal fit to the surface density runs as derived from gravitational lensing observations in around massive clusters that just require central slopes flatter and outer slopes steeper than the standard nfw ( cf .",
    "broadhurst at al .",
    "such a fit for a1689 requires high values @xmath99 and early transition epochs @xmath100 , related conditions that the two - stage development predicts to occur in about @xmath85 of the rich clusters ( lapi & cavaliere 2009b ) .",
    "we will adopt these @xmath2-profiles depending on the _ two _ dm key parameters @xmath2 and @xmath101 to describe the gravitational potential containing the icp , to which we now turn .",
    "we will focus on clusters in equilibrium conditions , in between the punctuating violent mergers for which we refer the reader to the review by markevitch & vikhlinin ( 2007 ) .",
    "when the dm halo is close to equilibrium , even more so will be the pervading icp ; in fact , the sound crossing time @xmath102 is seen to be somewhat shorter than the dynamical time @xmath103 on recalling from   1 that @xmath104 holds .",
    "in these conditions the icp is governed by the hydrostatic , jeans - like equation provided by the first and the second member of eq .",
    "( 2 ) . in a compact form similar to eq .",
    "( 3 ) this writes @xmath105 once the icp entropy run @xmath3 is given and used to factor out the product @xmath106 in the original eq .",

    "( 7 ) to yield the density slope @xmath108 , concurring with the gravitational pull measured by the ( squared ) ratio @xmath109 of the dm circular velocity ( discussed in   2 ) to the sound speed .",
    "the above constitutes just a first order differential equation , that transforms to linear in terms of the variable @xmath110 . by textbook recipes ( cf .",

    "2 ( top panel ) we plot the integral appearing in the above equation , along with the simple analytical fit presented in appendix a. note three circumstances .",
    "first , @xmath117 holds ( e.g. , @xmath118 on using @xmath119 , see eq .",
    "second , at the center the integral dominates in the square bracket ; thus the memory of the boundary condition is swamped while the integral is numerically found to scale as @xmath120 with the central entropy @xmath9 , see fig .  2 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "third , on approaching the center where the @xmath121-dependence of the bracket is already saturating , eq .",
    "( 8) implies @xmath122 .",
    "the issue to stress is that , rather than a model , the above eq .",
    "( 8) has the standing of a _ theorem _ in hydrostatics valid for the icp of clusters close to equilibrium .",
    "what actually needs _ physical _ modeling is the entropy run @xmath3 .",
    "we base upon the notions that entropy is erased by radiative cooling on the timescale @xmath123 @xmath124 gyr ( sarazin 1988 ) , while substantial raising requires _",
    "shocks _ ( see appendix b ) as are driven by supersonic outflows from center and set by inflows across the boundary .      at the outer end , the mathematics of eqs .",
    "( 7 ) requires one boundary condition fixing @xmath114 . on the observational side ,",
    "@xmath5 is found to decline slowly toward the virial radius ( molendi & pizzolato 2001 ) , and at such a rate it would take tens of mpcs to decline smoothly from kev values to those some @xmath125 times lower as prevailing in the external medium . so at @xmath126 a discontinuity is to occur and terminate the hot icp , at variance with the smooth if steeper decline of the dm density .",
    "in fact , most of the transition takes place across a few mean free paths @xmath127 at the _ accretion shocks _ produced when external gas supersonically falls into the dm potential .    numerical simulations ( e.g. , tormen et al .",
    "2004 ; see their fig .",
    "8) show that accretion of the smooth gas and minor lumps making up a major fraction of the accreted mass drives a complex patchwork of shocks mostly comprised within an outer layer with thickness of order @xmath128 ; across such a layer the standard conservation laws of mass , momentum and energy may be applied leading to the classic rankine - hugoniot jump conditions ; to within @xmath85 the results are similar to a coherent accretion shock , roughly spherical and located at @xmath129 ( see lcm05 for a complete treatment , and ettori & fabian 1998 for possibly delayed electron equilibrium ) .",
    "the impact of major lumps reaching down to the center will be dealt with in   3.1.3 .",
    "the jump conditions take on a particularly simple form for cold inflow into rich clusters that cause _ strong _ shocks with mach numbers squared @xmath130 considerably exceeding unity ( see appendix b ) . in strong shocks lingering at @xmath131 ( and expanding along with the cluster s development ) ,",
    "maximal conversion of infall energy occurs over a radial range of order @xmath127 , to yield @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the kinetic energy per unit mass of the gas freely falling across the potential drop down to @xmath134 from the turning point where infall starts ( see lcm05 ) .",
    "thus we find @xmath135 with values @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath137 and @xmath138 .    at the boundary the equilibrium eq .",
    "( 7 ) yields @xmath139",
    ". meanwhile , powerlaw approximations @xmath140 , @xmath141 apply in the vicinity of @xmath142 , so @xmath143 describes the icp mass @xmath144 in the outer layer , and correspondingly @xmath145 obtains .    on the other hand ,",

    "lc09 show that the dm entropy behaves as @xmath146 on considering that @xmath147 holds in the standard @xmath62cdm cosmogony for @xmath148 during the slow accretion stage .",
    "as external gas and dm are accreted in cosmic proportion , in the outer layer @xmath149 applies , and it follows that the icp entropy at the boundary can be expressed as @xmath150 then on equating the exponents in eqs .  ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) one finds @xmath151 with the values of @xmath114 discussed above , these yield the slopes @xmath152 and @xmath153 , both considerably _ flatter _ than the corresponding dm values .",
    "note from eq .",
    "( 13a ) how the slope @xmath154 at the boundary decreases if @xmath114 is increased .",
    "we expect such a decrease to take place for clusters with high concentrations corresponding to shallow outer potentials ( see lapi & cavaliere 2009b ) , that decrease the outer drops @xmath155 entering @xmath114 through eq .",
    "e.g. , a value @xmath84 ( holding for a cluster with an early transition , see ",
    "2 ) in place of the usual @xmath156 ( holding for clusters with a recent transition ) implies @xmath155 to lower to @xmath157 , @xmath114 to grow to @xmath158 , and @xmath154 to decrease to @xmath159 as may be the case for a1689 ( see lemze et al .",
    "2008 ; lapi & cavaliere 2009b ) ; meanwhile , from eq .",
    "( 13b ) @xmath160 increases to @xmath161 .",
    "a flat entropy slope may be also produced when the boundary shock is weakened by substantial preheating of the infalling gas ; such a condition is relevant for poor clusters and groups with comparatively low potentials ( see lcm05 ) , e.g. , @xmath162 applies to systems with @xmath163 with external preheating at levels around @xmath164 kev per particle .    on the other hand , after eqs .",
    "( 13 ) high values of @xmath165 with an upper bound at @xmath166 ( in keeping with the variance observed by cavagnolo et al .",
    "2009 ) correspond to low values of @xmath114 , hence to large @xmath155 ; these imply flat densities and temperatures sustained to high values in the outskirts .",
    "no other major sources or sinks of energy and entropy occur inward of the boundary at a few mpcs down to the central @xmath167 kpc .",
    "so throughout the icp bulk , the entropy slope is to stay at its boundary value @xmath168 , and in rich clusters with standard concentration @xmath169 is to hold , a result similar to tozzi & norman ( 2001 ) , lcm05 , and voit ( 2005 ) .    on the other hand , while the simple thermodynamics of the icp maintains the run of @xmath3 in this powerlaw form , its more complex adiabatic readjustments within the gravitational well cause the density slope @xmath170 to flatten out inward ; this is granted by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , as the inequality @xmath171 ( i.e. , @xmath172 ) progressively strengthens away from the boundary . as a result ,",

    "next we discuss the central value @xmath9 of the entropy and its origins .",
    "recall from   1 that the central entropy may be produced by shocks driven by substantial merging events reaching the center ( mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ; balogh et al . 2007 ) , and by agns residing in the central bulge - dominated galaxies ( see valageas & silk 1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2000 ; cavaliere et al . 2002 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; lcm05 ) .",
    "in addition , a basal entropy level may be left over by sne and agns that preheated the gas in the volume due to collapse into , or to accrete onto the cluster ( cavaliere et al .",

    "2008 ) .    to begin with ,",
    "consider preheating ; this may be expressed in terms of entropy advected across the shock by the currently infalling gas ( see appendix b ) .",
    "however , such a process is known to be effective only within limits : if always strong , it would flatten the bulk entropy slope of most clusters to values @xmath176 ( see   3.1.1 and fig .",

    "a possible happy end to the cooling story in clusters has been widely proposed and discussed ( see binney & tabor 1995 ; cavaliere et al .",

    "thus recurrent loops are conceivably started out by cooling that rekindles agns , that in turn feed back energy into the surrounding medium to eventually quench the bh accretion flow and ultimately yield quasi - steady , widespread conditions with @xmath9 reset over timescales of some @xmath186 yr to values around @xmath230 kev @xmath180 .",

    "2006 ) ; this implies for the output statistics @xmath233 a sharp decline above @xmath234 erg .",
    "we also note that hotter cluster centers tend to impair or prevent the supersonic condition necessary for driving strong pressurized blastwaves ( see appendix b ) , i.e. , @xmath235 corresponding to @xmath236 ; meanwhile the entropy deposited reads @xmath237 .",

    "this picture is currently under scrutiny in study cases such as provided by the poor cluster awm4 ; there the considerable value @xmath239 kev @xmath180 calls for a fueling process unrelated to cooling , with energetics higher than implied by the current radio activity .",

    "the icp , on the other hand , settles to equilibrium within the gravitational wells associated with the @xmath2-profiles , under control from the thermodynamic entropy produced by boundary and central shocks driven by agns or major mergers , plus a possible preheating basal level ( see   3 ) .",

    "first , in cc clusters the supermodel predicts a _ finite _ ( non - zero ) central @xmath198 with no need for any twist in cooling flow theories ; this rather constitutes a natural condition set by their equilibria at low @xmath9 and stabilized against cooling by recurrent agn activity .",
    "second , in ncc clusters we expect _ saturation _ to enforce stability of the higher @xmath9 levels set by the inputs from powerful agns and from the stronger if rarer mergers .",

    "( 24 ) and ( 31 ) prevails with @xmath5 _ passively _ following @xmath12 ; a novel feature emerging from the supermodel is the very close location of the two respective peaks .",
    "this is because such two homologous quantities arise from a _",
    "parallel _ response to the requirement of withstanding the common gravity for equilibrium ( see   6 , also fig .",
    "this gravity - induced behavior is at the root of the remarkable effectiveness of the simple model @xmath275 , which for the cc clusters holds well down toward the center ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the supermodel predicts the peak of @xmath5 to move toward progressively _",
    "smaller _ radii in going from rich clusters to groups .    on approaching the boundary",
    ", the run of @xmath5 again deviates upward from this passive trend ( see   3.1 and appendix b ) , with a boundary value @xmath262 sustained by the energy input associated to infall . here the passive icp behavior is again expected to be broken by the energy transfer due to electromagnetic interactions and _ localized _ to a range @xmath276 ( whilst bubbles or shocks starting from the center smear their energy out to some @xmath167 kpc , implying an effective @xmath277 ) .",

    "this specific prediction may be tested through extended simulations covering high-@xmath101 halos and nonadiabatic processes as discussed , e.g. , by borgani ( 2007 ) . in parallel ,",
    "high concentrations are keenly pinpointed by gravitational lensing observations ( lapi & cavaliere 2009b and references therein ) .",

    "this brings us to directly compare these two governing entropies .",
    "in a nutshell , their _ common _ features stem from smooth , slow gravitational mass infall onto the outskirts , while their detailed runs both in the outer and in the central range reflect their different sensitivity to other energy inputs .",
    "quantitatively , both the underlying key parameters @xmath114 and @xmath280 are amenable to _ conversion _ of infall kinetic energy .",
