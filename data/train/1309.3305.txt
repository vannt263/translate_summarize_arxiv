    "incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth ( bi ) in iii - v alloys such as gaas and ingaas to form the dilute bismide alloys gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and in@xmath6ga@xmath7bi@xmath1as@xmath2 has been experimentally found to rapidly reduce the band gap energy ( @xmath8 ) by up to 90 mev @xcite and 60 mev @xcite , respectively , per % bi for @xmath9 4  5% .",
    "additionally , experiments have also revealed the presence of a large bowing of the spin - orbit - splitting energy ( @xmath10 ) in these alloys , which increases strongly with increasing bi composition @xcite .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated experimentally @xcite and verified theoretically @xcite that these two properties lead , at sufficiently large @xmath11 ( @xmath12 10% ) , to the onset of an @xmath13 regime in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 .",
    "these characteristics of the dilute bismide alloys are highly attractive for potential device applications as they open up the possibility to suppress the chsh auger recombination mechanism , a non - radiative recombination process that severely degrades the efficiency and temperature stability of conventional inp - based photonic devices operating in the telecomm wavelength range ( 1.3  1.5 @xmath14 m ) @xcite .",
    "this motivates the development of simple models of the electronic structure of ( in)gabias alloys , which can be applied to study the characteristics of dilute bismide - based devices .",
    "since bi is significantly larger and more electropositive than as , it should be expected that bi behaves as an impurity in ( in)gaas and that , as a result of this , it should introduce bi - related defect states close in energy to the ( in)gaas valence band edge ( vbe ) .",
    "bi has been experimentally shown to form bound states in gap : bi , lying roughly 0.1 ev above the gap vbe @xcite .",
    "similarly , the formation of bi - related resonant states lying below the gaas vbe has been demonstrated by theoretical calculations of the valence band structure of gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the large bowing of @xmath8 and @xmath10 in ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and related alloys has been explained previously in terms of a band - anticrossing ( bac ) interaction between the gaas vbe and bi - related impurity states lying below it in energy @xcite , similar to that occuring in the conduction band in dilute nitride alloys .",
    "this simple phenomenological model has been successful in reproducing the measured variation of @xmath8 and @xmath10 with bi composition in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 .",
    "the initial models presented relied upon fitting the energy of the bi - related states ( @xmath15 ) and the bac coupling parameter ( @xmath16 ) to the experimentally measured variation of @xmath8 and @xmath10 with bi composition , while also treating the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 conduction band offset with respect to gaas as an additional free parameter . for example , such an approach has been applied to gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and in@xmath6ga@xmath7bi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloys in refs .   and  .",
    "based on an @xmath0 tight - binding model , calculations on large , disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloy supercells have verified the presence of bac - like behaviour in the valence band , while also reproducing the measured variation of @xmath8 and @xmath10 with @xmath11 over a large composition range ( up to @xmath17 13@xmath18 ) @xcite . since the tight - binding model employs a basis of localised atomic orbitals , it is well suited to probe the character of states associated with an isolated impurity in large supercells @xcite .",
    "detailed calculations on ordered gabi@xmath1p@xmath2 and gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercells using the tight - binding model have confirmed the presence of the bound and resonant bi - related states in gap : bi and gaas : bi , respectively @xcite . in this approach , by examining the character of the bi - related states , we can directly derive ( i ) the bac parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and ( ii ) the composition dependence of the band offsets , in a given bi - containing supercell @xcite .",
    "this then eliminates the need to fit these quantities to the results of experimental measurements .    in this article",
    "we apply our tight - binding model to ordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercells and outline the derivation of a 12-band @xmath3 hamiltonian for ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 ( the full details of which can be found in ref .  ) .",
    "the 12-band model , which includes bac interactions between the extended states of the host ( in)gaas matrix and bi - related resonant states lying below the host matrix vbe , is shown to be in excellent agreement with full tight - binding calculations of the band structure in bi - containing supercells , verifying the validity of the bac approach to dilute bismide band structure .",
    "we demonstrate this by applying the 12-band model to in@xmath6ga@xmath7bi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloys and comparing the results of our calculations to the available experimental data for this new material system .",
    "the remainder of the article is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : tight_binding_model ] we give a brief overview of the tight - binding model used to study dilute bismide alloys . in section  [ sec : ordered_supercells ] this model is applied to ordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercells and the parameters of the bac model are calculated explicitly .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : kdotp_models ] , we use the insight gained from the tight - binding calculations to derive an appropriate 12-band @xmath3 hamiltonian for ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : comparison_with_experiment ] we verify the validity of the bac approach by applying the @xmath3 models of section  [ sec : kdotp_models ] to the study of in@xmath4ga@xmath5bi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloys .",
    "we presented in ref .",
    "a nearest - neighbour @xmath0 tight - binding hamiltonian , including spin - orbit - coupling , for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 . here",
    "we combine this hamiltonian with @xmath0 hamiltonians for inas and inbi to give an @xmath0 hamiltonian for the quaternary dilute bismide alloy in@xmath6ga@xmath7bi@xmath1as@xmath2 .    in our tight - binding model",
    "we begin by relaxing the atomic positions in a given ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 supercell to their lowest energy configuration using a valence force field model based on the keating potential @xcite .",
    "the on - site energies of the relaxed supercell hamiltonian are taken to depend on the overall neighbour environment and the inter - atomic interaction energies are taken to vary with the relaxed nearest - neighbour bond length @xmath19 as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the equilibrium bond length in the equivalent binary compound , and @xmath22 is a dimensionless scaling parameter ( the magnitude of which depends on the type of interaction being considered ) .",
    "full details of the tight - binding model can be found in ref .  .",
    "we examine the electronic structure of ordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 crystals by inserting a single substitutional bi atom in a series of cubic y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 ( y = ga , in ) supercells containing a total of @xmath26 atoms , for @xmath27 .    in ref .",
    "we showed that the spectrum of fractional @xmath28 character for a given alloy supercell , @xmath29 , is a useful tool for examining the evolution of the electronic structure of impurity containing alloys , where @xmath30 is defined as the projection of the host matrix ( gaas or inas ) band edge states ( @xmath31 ) onto the full spectrum of levels in the alloy ( ybi@xmath1as@xmath2 ) supercells , @xmath32 :    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the degeneracy of the host band having energy @xmath35 at the @xmath28-point in the brillouin zone and @xmath36 is a dirac delta function centred at energy @xmath37 .",
    "calculations of @xmath29 in y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 supercells show mixing between the host yas vbe states and bi - related states lying below it in energy , consistent with the presence of a bac interaction in the ybi@xmath1as@xmath2 valence band @xcite .    in order to confirm this",
    ", we examine the bac model explicitly for each bi - containing supercell by constructing the bi - related impurity state @xmath38 associated with the substitutional bi atom present in each supercell . in the bac model , the alloy vbe states @xmath39 are a linear combination of the four host vbe states @xmath40 ( at energy @xmath41 ) and the bi - related defect states @xmath42 :    @xmath43    where the indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 run over the four - fold degenerate states of the y@xmath23as@xmath23 and y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 vbes , respectively @xcite .    from eq .",
    "we can calculate the energy of the bi states and the strength of their interaction with the host vbe using the full @xmath0 hamiltonian of the y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 supercell , @xmath46 , to find :    @xmath47    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the bi composition , @xmath16 is the bac interaction parameter , and @xmath50 is the host vbe state with which @xmath42 interacts @xcite .",
    "our results show that a substitutional bi atom in ga@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 or in in@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 forms , a set of four - fold degenerate resonant states at energy @xmath15 , which are highly localised about the bi site , and that the strength of the interaction between these states and the host vbe varies with bi composition @xmath11 as @xmath51 for large supercells .",
    "figure 1 shows the calculated values of the energy separation between the host vbe and bi resonant state , @xmath52 , as well as the bac coupling parameter @xmath16 , as a function of supercell size for a series of ordered y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 ( y = ga , in ) supercells .",
    "we observe a strong variation of @xmath53 and @xmath16 with bi composition at larger @xmath11 , with the trends stabilising as @xmath11 approaches the dilute doping limit in the larger ( @xmath54 2000 atom ) supercells @xcite .",
    "this is primarily due to the folding of the host valence band states back to the @xmath28 point as the supercell size is increased , which makes more states available to construct @xmath42 in the larger supercells .",
    "therefore , we conclude that one should refer to large supercell calculations when examining the behaviour of a substitutional bi impurity in ( in)gaas alloys . a detailed discussion of this aspect of the calculations and its consequences for the interpretation of the bac model as applied to the valence band structure of dilute bismide alloys can be found in ref .  .",

    "as a guide to the eye , solid ( dashed ) lines have been inserted to highlight the evolution of the bac parameters with bi composition in the ga@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 ( in@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 ) cases .",
    "the zero of energy is taken in each case at the host vbe and is denoted by a horizontal line at 0 ev . ]",
    "it is interesting to note here the similar character of the bi - related states in ga@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 and in in@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25  the impurity states associated with isolated bi impurities in gaas and inas lie within 0.1 ev of one another in all supercells considered .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the case of a substitutional nitrogen ( n ) atom in gaas or in inas , where the n - related impurity states lie approximately 0.19 ev and 0.97 ev above the host conduction band edge respectively @xcite . in the dilute nitride case",
    "this different behavior arises primarily due to differences in the gaas and inas conduction band structures @xcite .",
    "since bi primarily affects the valence band in ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , we then attribute the similarity of the bi - related states in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 to the relative similarity of the valence band structure of gaas and inas , including a very similar spin - orbit - splitting energy of 340 mev and 380 mev respectively .",
    "by contrast the spin - orbit - splitting energy is only 80 mev in gap .",
    "this difference in band structure , as well as the greater difference in size and electronegativity between p and bi compared to that between as and bi then leads to bi introducing a defect state about 0.1 ev above the valence band maximum in gap  @xcite .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : bac_parameters ] the calculated values of @xmath53 and @xmath16 in the y@xmath58bi@xmath24as@xmath59 ( @xmath60 2 ) and y@xmath61bi@xmath24as@xmath62 ( @xmath60 8) supercells .",
    "our calculations predict that a substitutional bi impurity produces a resonant state lying approximately 0.18 ev ( 0.22 ev ) below the gaas ( inas ) vbe in the dilute doping limit .",
    "using these detailed supercell calculations to further inform our analysis , we derive in the next section a 12-band @xmath3 hamiltonian to describe the band structure of ordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 crystals .",
    "as we have seen , detailed tight - binding calculations on ordered supercells show that ( i ) bi incorporation in ( in)gaas should be treated as impurity - like , with substitutional incorporation resulting in a set of four - fold bi - related impurity states lying below the host vbe , and ( ii ) that these states interact with the extended host vbe states through a bi composition - dependent bac interaction .",
    "to arrive at an appropriate @xmath3 hamiltonian for ybi@xmath1as@xmath2 ( y = ga , in ) we begin by noting that large supercell calculations on disordered gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 alloys indicate a conventional alloy evolution of the conduction and spin - split - off bands with @xmath11 , with for example , an approximately linear decrease in the energy of the gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 conduction band minimum at @xmath28 of about 28 mev per % bi @xcite .    beginning with an 8-band @xmath3 hamiltonian for yas ( y = ga , in ) and combining this with the calculations presented in section  [ sec : ordered_supercells ] , we can then derive a 12-band @xmath3 model for ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 .",
    "the 12-band model is obtained by augmenting the 8-band basis of host matrix band edge bloch states through the inclusion of a set of four - fold degenerate bi - related basis states at energy @xmath15 , below the vbe .",
    "the bi - related states can be selected to have the same symmetry as the heavy- and light - hole ( hh and lh ) host states , and the resulting pairs of two - fold degenerate bi states then interact with the host hh and lh states via the bi composition dependent bac matrix elements @xmath51 .",
    "full details of the 12-band model are given in ref .  .",
    "we note that the dilute bismide @xmath3 hamiltonian presented here does not include a bac interaction with an additional ( two - fold degenerate ) bi - related spin - split - off impurity level lying deeper in the valence band , as was considered in ref .  . our previous calculations in ref",
    "indicate that in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 the energy of the spin - split - off band edge decreases with increasing bi composition @xmath11 .",
    "a detailed analysis showed that the evolution of the spin - split - off band with increasing bi composition in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 can in fact be described using a conventional alloy model , and no evidence was found for additional bi - related states lying lower in the valence band .",
    "tight - binding calculations show the evolution of the spin - split - off band in inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 to be similar to that in gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 , so that it is then appropriate to treat the impact of bi using a 12-band hamiltonian , without the need to include the two addiitonal bi - related states presented in the 14-band model of ref .  .",
    "in order to compare the results of the 12-band model with the full tight - binding ( ftb ) calculations we begin by first establishing 8-band @xmath3 models for gaas and inas .",
    "the zone centre ( in)gaas states obtained from the ftb calculation at @xmath28 provide the basis states to parametrise the 8-band gaas and inas hamiltonians directly from their respective @xmath0 hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "the 8-band @xmath3 models obtained from this approach for gaas and inas are compared to the ftb band structures in figures  [ fig : ga32as32 ] and  [ fig : in32as32 ] , where we observe excellent agreement between both sets of calculations in the vicinity of the @xmath28 point .    using these 8-band models as starting points",
    ", we construct the 12-band hamiltonian for a given bi - containing supercell by firstly using eqs .   and   to calculate @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the supercell .",
    "these parameters are then combined with the 8-band parameters of the corresponding bi - free supercell as well as the bi composition dependence of the band edge energies @xcite to give the appropriate @xmath3 hamiltonian for the y@xmath23bi@xmath24as@xmath25 supercell .",
    "figures  [ fig : ga32bi1as31 ] and  [ fig : in32bi1as31 ] compare the band structures calculated using this approach with the ftb calculations of the band structure for the 64-atom , ga@xmath58bi@xmath24as@xmath59 and in@xmath58bi@xmath24as@xmath59 supercells ( @xmath63 3.125% ) .",
    "the calculations demonstrate excellent agreement between the @xmath0 and 12-band models .",
    "the presence of a bac interaction in the valence band is confirmed by the existence of tight - binding bands that correspond in both cases to the lower energy bi - related impurity bands ( @xmath64 ) of the 12-band hamiltonian .",
    "these exemplar calculations confirm the validity of the bac approach as applied to dilute bismide valence band structure .",
    "it is , however , important to note that the direct correspondence observed between the bi impurity bands in the calculations presented in figures  [ fig : ga32bi1as31 ] and  [ fig : in32bi1as31 ] occurs because the highest folded valence bands in the 64-atom y@xmath58as@xmath58 ( y = ga , in ) supercells lie over 1 ev below the host vbe .",
    "this results in a low density of host valence states in the proximity of the bi - related impurity states , when compared to larger supercells in which there is a higher density of folded host matrix states , leading to the bi impurity forming a resonant state , which is spread over several of the host levels .",
    "this energy broadening of the lower - lying impurity bands accounts for the inability to resolve any bi - related features lying below the vbe in spectroscopic measurements @xcite .    in summary",
    ", the overall agreement of the 12-band @xmath3 model with the ftb calculations confirms that the bac model accurately describes the main effects of bi on the band structure of ordered ( in)gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 structures . in the next section ,",
    "we apply the 12-band @xmath3 model to compare the calculated variations of the energy gap , e@xmath65 and spin - orbit - splitting energy @xmath10 with spectroscopic measurements on a series of in@xmath4ga@xmath5bi@xmath1as@xmath2/inp epilayers .",
    "we now extend the 12-band model outlined in section  [ sec : kdotp_models ] and ref .   for gabi@xmath1as@xmath2 and inbi@xmath1as@xmath2 to the quaternary dilute bismide alloy in@xmath6ga@xmath7bi@xmath1as@xmath2 . using the derived @xmath3 hamiltonian we demonstrate the validity of the approach outlined in sections  [ sec : ordered_supercells ] and  [ sec : kdotp_models ] by comparing the calculated variations of the room temperature band gap and spin - orbit - splitting energies with bi composition against spectroscopic measurements on a series of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) grown in@xmath4ga@xmath5bi@xmath1as@xmath2 samples , grown pseudomorphically on inp : fe substrates .",
