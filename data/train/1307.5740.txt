    "according to astrophysical and cosmological observations in recent years , about a quarter of the energy of our universe is made up of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , which is further confirmed by the recent planck measurement  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the nature of dm remains an open question . on the market ,",
    "the most attractive dm candidate is the weakly interacting massive particle , whose mass and interaction strength can naturally explain the dm relic density .",
    "obviously , detecting the signals of dm particles via non gravitational effects is helpful to reveal the mystery of dm .    at the tree level",
    ", dm particles should have no direct coupling to photons , otherwise they should be called as `` luminous matter '' .",
    "nevertheless , a pair of dm particles can annihilate into two photons via loop - induced processes , i.e. via @xmath5 , as shown in refs .",
    "the photon produced via such loop - induced processes is monochromatic and carries the energy of the dm particle mass @xmath6 .",
    "if such photons have large flux and can be captured by detectors , they will be identified as a `` line '' and be distinguished from the continuous astrophysical background spectrum clearly . if such a characteristic line signature is detected , it is the `` smoking gun '' discovery for the dm particles .",
    "recently , several studies of the fermi - lat @xmath7-ray data have shown that there might exist a monochromatic @xmath7-ray line near the energy @xmath8 from the galactic center region  @xcite .",
    "if such a monochromatic @xmath7-ray line is true , it could be interpreted as the result of the dm annihilation into photons in the galactic center with a cross section of @xmath9 .",
    "however , the fermi - lat collaboration did not confirm such a @xmath7-ray line in the latest analysis  @xcite .",
    "instead , they set the upper limits on the dm annihilation cross section into photons .",
    "in addition to direct searches for the dm particles scattering off nuclei in underground detectors and indirect searches for dm annihilation / decay products from outer space , @xmath10-scale colliders provide another independent and complementary approach to search for the dm particles produced via high energy collisions .",
    "although dm particles almost can not interact with materials of the general - purpose detectors , it has been pointed out that either the mono - jet channel or the mono - photon associating with a large missing energy ( @xmath11 ) can be a distinctive signature in dm searches at both hadron and electron colliders  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between dm particles and photons which induces a  line \" signal via the process @xmath5 can also lead to the process @xmath4 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn_prod ] .",
    "thus the potential @xmath7-ray line signal can be tested independently at future @xmath0 colliders . in this work ,",
    "we explore the prospect of the dm searching at @xmath0 colliders by using the mono - photon signature , i.e. the @xmath12 channel .     at @xmath0 colliders . ]    in a model - independent way , the interaction terms between a pair of dm particles and a pair of standard model ( sm ) particles can be described by effective operators , typically high - dimensional and non - renormalizable  @xcite",
    ". such a treatment would be valid if dm particles couple to sm particles via exchanging some mediators which are sufficiently heavy . in the framework of the effective field theory ,",
    "the scattering , annihilation , and production cross sections of dm particles can be easily related to each other  @xcite , which offers a convenient way to comprehend the correlations among three kinds of dm searching experiments .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt two effective operators to describe the interaction between dm particles ( either a dirac or a scalar dm particle ) and photons , and investigate their experimental sensitivity at future @xmath0 colliders .",
    "we also explore that the effects of beam polarization to the background @xmath13 and the dm signal , and we find that a realistic beam polarization can greatly suppress the background events and enhance the production rate of signal events .",
    "as well - known , the effective theory approach would break down if the collision energy is sufficiently high due to the power dependence on @xmath14 of matrix elements . in this work ,",
    "we revisit the method to derive a general unitary condition for @xmath3 processes .",

    "we consider two types of dm particles : one is a dirac fermion and the other is a complex scalar particle .",
    "we assume a pair of dm particles couple to photons through the following two effective operators : @xmath15 for the dirac fermionic dm and @xmath16 for the complex scalar dm , respectively .    for nonrelativistic dm particles in the galaxy , the annihilation cross sections into photons can read @xmath17 and @xmath18 to interpret the fermi @xmath7-ray line signal at @xmath8 , a cross section of @xmath19 is needed , which corresponds to @xmath20 for the fermionic ( scalar ) dm .",
    "the dimensional analysis tells us that the cross section of the @xmath14-wave annihilation is proportional to @xmath21 for an @xmath22-dimension operator .",
    "the operator for the fermionic dm given in eq .   has a dimension 7 , higher than that for the scalar dm .",
    "therefore the fermionic dm annihilation is more suppressed . as a result , in order to achieve the same cross section for a fixed dm mass , a lower @xmath23 , which means a stronger coupling , is needed for the fermionic dm .    at the @xmath0 colliders ,",
    "the leading dm production process for the operators discussed above is @xmath24 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn_prod ] .",
    "dm particles can pass through the detectors and leave a large missing energy .",
    "therefore , we can use mono - photon and a large missing energy to search the signals .",
    "it is remarkable that the dimensional analysis essentially determine the experimental sensitivity to dm - photon interactions at colliders . in other words , for the operators with the same mass dimension , their collider detection sensitivity are rather similar , while their lorentz structures play minor roles .",
    "therefore , we confine to address two representative operators given in eqs .   and .",

    "@xcite for a more comprehensive discussion about various dm - photon effective operators .    for the @xmath12 searching channel ,",
    "the sm process @xmath13 is an irreducible background  @xcite , since neutrinos , like dm particles , are also undetectable in a general - purpose detector .",
    "the sm background is contributed by two feynman diagrams : one involves the @xmath25-channel @xmath26 boson exchange and the other involves the @xmath14-channel @xmath27 boson exchange .",
    "another possible background is @xmath28 , where neither the @xmath29 nor the @xmath30 in the final state is detected .",
    "other minor sm backgrounds can be safely neglected .",
    "we explore the dm searching prospect at the @xmath0 colliders with @xmath31 ( `` higgs factory '' ) , @xmath32 ( typical ilc ) , @xmath33 ( upgraded ilc and initial clic ) , and @xmath34 ( ultimate clic ) .",

    "the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter is assumed to be @xmath35 as specified in the design of the ild detector  @xcite .",
    "we propose the following cuts to suppress the sm background events :    * cut 1 : * _ select the events containing a photon with @xmath36 and @xmath37 . veto the events containing any other particle with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , or with @xmath40 and @xmath41 . _",

    "the monophoton is required to be energetic enough ( @xmath36 ) and not close to the beam axis ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the veto on other particles would effectively eliminate the events from @xmath28 and other background events .",
