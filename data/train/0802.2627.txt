    "many recent works @xcite have considered a nonperturbative framework to investigate the mott metal - insulator transition ( mit ) @xcite in lattice electrons with local interaction and disorder using the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . for example , the anderson transition @xcite has been explored on the bethe lattice @xcite considering the hubbard and falikov - kimball models . in these studies ,",
    "the mott mit is characterized by opening a gap in the density of states at the fermi level . at the anderson localization , the character of the spectrum at the fermi level changes from a continuous to a dense discrete one .",
    "the study of disordered systems requires the use of probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "one is usually interested in typical values of these quantities which are mathematically given by the most probable value of the pdf .",
    "the metal and the insulator phases could be detected by analyzing the local density of states ( ldos ) .",
    "in particular , the arithmetic mean of this random one - particle quantity is noncritical at the anderson transition and hence can not help to detect the localization transition .",
    "by contrast , the geometric mean gives a better approximation of the averaged value of the ldos @xcite , as it vanishes at a critical strength of the disorder and hence provides an explicit criterion for anderson localization @xcite .",
    "recently , we adopted the hlder mean to analyze how the averaged ldos depends on each hlder parameter that is used .",
    "we showed that the averaged ldos can vanish in the band center at a critical strength of the disorder for a wide variety of averages @xcite .",
    "most of these studies are restricted to the hopping between nearest - neighbors ( nns ) .",
    "recent works suggest that the inclusion of next - nearest - neighbors ( nnns ) hopping in the model favors the long - range magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "the investigation of these effect is particularly interesting .",
    "the breaking of particle - hole symmetry , even at half filling , is a generic property of real materials and creates effects on the paramagnetic phase @xcite , besides the frustration of the antiferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "the effect of nonrandom nnn hopping becomes evident already in the noninteracting system through an asymmetric density of states ( dos ) , as already derived for an arbitrary hopping on the bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the long - range correlated disorder can be generated in a variety of stochastic processes in nature @xcite .",
    "a tight - binding one - dimensional model of electronic states with the on - site energies exhibiting long - range correlated disorder and nonrandom hopping amplitudes was studied in ref .",
    "the presence of an anderson - like metal insulator transition was revealed for a finite range of energy values where the lyapunov coefficient vanishes .",
    "the correlation in the disorder favors the emergence of the extended phase .    in this paper , we investigate two different aspects for the anderson - falicov - kimball model .",
    "first , considering nearest - neighbor ( nns ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnns ) hoppings , we analyzed how the presence of the nnn hoppings influence the phase diagram of the ground state of this model using geometric and arithmetic averages .",
    "besides that , we showed how the chemical potential varies as we look at the half - filled band of different systems ; the inclusion of the nnn hopping dislocates the half - filled band from the band center , independent of the disorder that is considered .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram is also presented for different values of nnn hoppings .",
    "secondly , we studied the main effects of the long - range correlated disorder ( characterized by the exponent @xmath0 ) in the anderson - falicov - kimball model . unlike the one - dimensional anderson model , this disorder does not have a great influence on the behavior of the system .",
    "we present the ground - state phase diagram for electrons in a half - filled band for different values of this disorder and the dependence of the disorder in terms of the exponent @xmath0 for a system without coulomb repulsion .    in the pure half - filled falicov - kimball model , the fermi energy for electrons is inside of the correlation ( mott ) gap opened by increasing the interaction @xcite .",
    "we want to examine how the disorder influences this gap .",
    "the pure falicov - kimball model describes two species of particles , mobile and immobile , which interact with each other when both are on the same lattice site .",
    "this model is the simplest model to study metal - insulator transitions in mixed valence compounds of rare earth and transition metal oxides , ordering in mixed valence systems , order - disorder transitions in binary alloys , itinerant magnetism @xcite , crystallization , electronic ferroelectricity in mixed - valence compounds , and phase diagrams of metal ammonia solutions @xcite .",
    "it also captures some aspects of the mott - hubbard mit @xcite .",
    "the anderson - falicov - kimball model considers mobile particles that are disturbed by a local random potential , giving rise to a competition between interaction and disorder .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are , respectively , the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the mobile and immobile fermions ( electrons and ions , respectively ) at a lattice site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the electron transfer integral connecting sites @xmath6 and @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the coulomb repulsion that operates when one ion and one electron occupy the same site .",
    "we assume @xmath10 the average number of electrons and ions on site @xmath6 are denoted , respectively , as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we consider that the occupation @xmath13 on the @xmath6th site has probability @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it was assumed , for simplicity , that just mobile particles are subjected to the structural disorder @xcite .",
    "the energy @xmath16 is a random , independent variable , describing the local disorder disturbing the motion of electrons .",
    "the model is solved within the dmft framework .    in section [ dmftmodel ]",
    "we present the dmft approach applied to the anderson - falikov - kimball model @xcite . in section [ results1 ]",
    "we present the numerical results concerning the ground - state phase diagram for the next - nearest - neighbor hopping case . in section [ results2 ]",
    "we discuss the above model for the long - range correlated disorder . finally in section [ conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the formalism is based on the introduction of the hybridization function @xmath17 , which is a dynamical mean field describing the coupling of a selected lattice site with the rest of the system @xcite .",
    "the dmft is calculated from the hilbert transforms @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the non - interacting density of states and @xmath21 the translationally invariant green function .",
