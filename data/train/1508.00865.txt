    "such `` dynamical diseases ''  @xcite , i.e. , diseases resulting from abnormal activity in an otherwise intact physiological system , are a significant public health burden in developed countries . for example , in the united states , diseases of the heart constitute the leading cause of death ( responsible for about 25% of all deaths ) , of which more than half can be classified as sudden cardiac deaths  @xcite . even in developing countries , in recent times heart disease",
    "has overtaken other causes of death , e.g. , sudden cardiac deaths contributed to about 10% of overall mortality in certain regions in india , accounting for upto half of all cardiovascular - related deaths  @xcite .",
    "several studies have shown that early detection of onset of arrhythmia resulting in prompt therapeutic intervention significantly improves the chances of surviving such episodes  @xcite .",
    "thus , developing methods for identifying signs of impending arrhythmic events with potentially serious consequences can significantly contribute towards reducing the mortality rate due to sudden cardiac death . with this aim in view",
    "there have been a number of attempts at applying time - series analysis methods on cardiac activity data in order to extract robust indicators of imminent instances of temporal irregularities in the heart",
    ". however , the complexity of heart rate dynamics makes it difficult to characterize and distinguish the temporal signatures of a healthy heart from a diseased one  @xcite .",
    "most studies of cardiac time - series have focused on heart rate variability as measured by temporal changes in the _ r - r interval _ , the duration between successive episodes of ventricular depolarization which triggers contraction of the lower chambers of the heart .",
    "following the pioneering observations connecting decreased variance in r - r intervals with higher mortality risk in patients suffering myocardial infarction  @xcite , it is now generally accepted that healthy individuals have higher heart - rate variability compared to those with diseased hearts  @xcite . however ,",
    "certain pathological conditions including cardiac arrhythmia are seen to be extremely irregular  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been observed that a transition from tachycardia , i.e. , abnormally rapid heart - rate , to fibrillation , characterized by erratic muscle activity that prevents the heart from pumping blood , is marked by a switch from relatively more periodic activity to a highly irregular dynamical state  @xcite . while the r - r intervals in normal sinus rhythm appear to have almost as unpredictable a nature as that seen during fibrillation  @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that the `` chaoticity '' during normal cardiac activity arises through interaction of the heart with the nervous system  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the spatiotemporal chaos associated with fibrillation arises from intrinsic instabilities in cardiac excitation dynamics  @xcite .",
    "one possible route from tachycardia to fibrillation that has been established through extensive simulation studies of models of cardiac electrical activity is the degeneration of reentrant spiral wave ( corresponding to tachycardia ) to disordered , turbulent activity ( characterizing fibrillation ) through spiral breakup  @xcite .",
    "this dynamical transition has been reproduced in a wide range of systems , from simple , excitable media to biologically detailed models , underlining the robustness of the scenario  @xcite .",
    "thus , the study of spatiotemporal dynamics in models of electrical activity in cardiac tissue provides another perspective to identify indicators for an impending onset of possibly life - threatening arrhythmia .    in this paper , we focus on analyzing time - series data obtained from spatially extended models of cardiac ventricular activity in which , by tuning specific physiological parameters , one can observe transitions to different dynamical regimes representing various classes of arrhythmia .",
    "this allows us to look for statistical signatures that can help in early detection of arrhythmic episodes , where the observed patterns are exclusively due to abnormal excitation activity that characterizes such arrhythmia and unrelated to heart rate variability that arises from the influence of the nervous system on the sinus node , the natural pacemaker of the heart  @xcite .",
    "this study , therefore , provides a benchmark against which analysis of ecg data obtained from clinical studies can be compared , enabling distinction of statistical features of arrhythmic time - series that are intrinsic to the dynamics of heart muscle from those that are a result of changes in the autonomic modulation of cardiovascular function ( achieved through dynamical balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic effects  @xcite ) . as signature patterns ( if they exist ) that indicate transitions from one dynamical regime of cardiac activity to another may be masked by other effects in reality , establishing them through analysis of the model output will allow us to look for them in data obtained from experimental or clinical studies .    here , for our statistical analysis , we have focused on the sequence of time - intervals @xmath0 between successive excitations of ventricular muscle cells ( analogous to the r - r interval for ecgs ) as a representative feature of heart rate dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . an important result of our study is that the distribution of these intervals exhibit clearly observable changes in their moments - in particular , the skewness - around the onset of qualitatively distinct dynamical behavior characterizing various arrhythmic episodes ( represented by the different panels in fig .",

    "intriguingly , we also observe that at these transitions , the distribution of the time - intervals appears to agree better with benford s law ( bl ) , an empirically established feature of the frequency distribution of leading digits of numbers occurring in many phenomena in various physical , biological and social contexts  @xcite .",
    "both variation in skewness  @xcite and closer agreement with bl  @xcite have independently been suggested as indicators of regime shifts or phase transitions in different systems .",

    "in fact , the empirical distribution shows the best agreement with bl in the spatiotemporally chaotic state corresponding to @xmath81 ( fig .",

    "we see that that this distribution of leading digits @xmath53 is closest to bl at the transition points corresponding to chaotic meandering ( @xmath82 ) and spiral breakup ( @xmath83 ) .        to understand the nature of the distributions in the different dynamical regimes better , we show how the moments of the distribution for the time intervals @xmath49 and that for the corresponding leading digits @xmath53 of the normalized intervals vary with increasing @xmath3 ( fig .",

    "the skewness @xmath87 of the distribution is the most informative of all the moments considered here , as it shows large deviations from zero only around critical values of @xmath3 associated with transitions between different dynamical regimes .",
    "in particular , we notice peaks in the skewness at @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 which correspond to transition to quasiperiodic meandering , chaotic meandering and spiral breakup , respectively ( fig .",

    ", it suggests a deep relation between the appearance of bl in natural phenomena and the degree of skewness in the distributions of the underlying variables .",
    "statistical analysis of data ( in particular , ecg ) that is representative of cardiac functionality can provide us with effective signatures for the detection of arrhythmia at an early stage . despite such analyses ,",
    "certain kinds of arrhythmia fail to get detected merely due to the complexity involved .",
    "part of the difficulty lies in cardiovascular activity being a joint outcome of intrinsic spatiotemporal excitation dynamics in heart muscle and modulation of the sinus node by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system .",
    "here we have studied biophysically detailed models of ventricular activity to infer signatures of dynamical transitions characterizing the onset of different kinds of arrhythmia .",
    "this makes it possible to disentangle the effects of intrinsic excitation dynamics in the heart from the influence of the nervous system . in principle , it allows identification of patterns that may alert one to impending harmful disruptions in the rhythmic activity of the heart , but which could be masked in the ecg signal by autonomic modulation effects .",
    "our results show that as the spatiotemporal excitations in the ventricles become more disordered , leading to phenomena identified with sustained monomorphic and polymorphic tachycardia as well as the onset of fibrillation , these transitions are marked by characteristic changes in statistical moments associated with the distribution of inter - activation intervals .",
    "in addition , the leading digits of these intervals show a closer agreement with bl at the transition points .",
    "our result can potentially be applied in augmenting algorithms used in implanted devices ( icds ) for detecting transitions to possible life - threatening arrhythmia so as to initiate a program of treatment  @xcite .",
    "thus , when continual monitoring of heartbeat time - series shows either increased skewness or a closer agreement to bl , it may signal a transition in the dynamical state of the heart so that suitable pacing therapy can be started .",
    "however , for such an application , our observations would need to be validated in ecg recordings made during tachycardia and onset of fibrillation in live animals .",
    "such validation is necessary in view of the limitations of the present study , involving as it does two - dimensional monodomain models of homogeneous cardiac tissue .",
    "examining the passage from normal cardiac activity to different arrhythmic regimes from the perspective of phase transitions can provide novel insights , as has been pointed out by several earlier studies .",
    "for instance , power - law behavior , which characterize critical phenomena in physical systems , have been reported in r - r interval fluctuations and are seen to be remarkable predictors of arrhythmic death , with a steeper negative slope of the power spectra ( in log scale ) clearly distinguishing a diseased heart from a healthy one  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been shown that phase transition - like dynamics is exhibited by healthy human heart rate , indicated by long range correlations which is a hallmark of criticality  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of an abnormal heart rate reveals significant digression from critical behavior .",
    "in addition , scale invariance , which is seen in systems close to critical point , has been shown to be indicative of a healthy heart - with its absence being a statistical feature that can alert us about pathological conditions  @xcite .",
    "our results provide yet another connection between onset of arrhythmia and phase transitions by showing that sharp changes in the skewness of the distribution of dynamical variables , that has previously been associated with dynamical transitions in other systems  @xcite , can potentially act as a robust indicator of transitions between monomorphic tachycardia , polymorphic tachycardia and fibrillation in the heart .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the appearance of bl has also been linked to phase transitions in physical systems  @xcite .",
    "as the benford distribution follows from requirement of scale invariance of the underlying numbers  @xcite , it is tempting to connect this with the scale invariance of distribution of dynamical variables associated with critical points at which transitions occur .",
    "we observe from our results that parameter regimes that give rise to relatively broad distributions of the time - intervals ( as is the situation for spatiotemporally chaotic states ) show better agreement with bl than those associated with highly confined distributions ( as in the case of a rigidly rotating spiral ) .",
    "however , the occurrence of chaos in dynamical systems by itself does not guarantee that bl will be obeyed  @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that the appearance of benford distribution is more closely associated with the onset of dynamical transitions rather than the specific nature of the dynamical states on either side of the transition point .",
    "we also note that distributions that follow bl are , in general , associated with high skewness  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the highly skewed nature of distributions during dynamical transitions and the observation of better agreement with bl at those points may not be independent of each other .",
    "thus , our results imply that the increased skewness associated with regime shifts and the appearance of benford distribution during phase transitions - which have been reported earlier in different contexts - are , in fact , related .",

    "<S> disruptions in the normal rhythmic functioning of the heart , termed as arrhythmia , often result from qualitative changes in the excitation dynamics of the organ . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions between different types of arrhythmia are accompanied by alterations in the spatiotemporal pattern of electrical activity that can be measured by observing the time - intervals between successive excitations of different regions of the cardiac tissue . using biophysically detailed models of cardiac activity </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distribution of these time - intervals exhibit a systematic change in their skewness during such dynamical transitions . </S>",
    "<S> further , the leading digits of the normalized intervals appear to fit benford s law better at these transition points . </S>",
    "<S> this raises the possibility of using these observations to design a clinical indicator for identifying changes in the nature of arrhythmia . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , our results reveal an intriguing relation between the changing skewness of a distribution and its agreement with benford s law , both of which have been independently proposed earlier as indicators of regime shift in dynamical systems . </S>"
