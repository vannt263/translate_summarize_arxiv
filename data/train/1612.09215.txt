    "globally cylindrically symmetric solutions of the einstein field equations ( efes ) , at first sight , may not seem to be physically relevant since they impose infinitely long sources . nonetheless , under controlled circumstances",
    ", they can provide fairly accurate descriptions of different physical phenomena .",
    "in newtonian theory , the gravitational field produced by an infinite cylindrical source has a potential @xmath5 , in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath6 such that the axis lies at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass per unit length of the source .",
    "working out the corresponding field in einstein s theory of gravitation , which has been done by levi - civita @xcite in 1919 , one obtains a similar potential for the newtonian limit with a parameter @xmath8 .",
    "however , as demonstrated by marder @xcite in 1958 , a second independent parameter emerges , which has been interpreted as a topological defect @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , the parameter @xmath8 is the most difficult and elusive to be interpreted and there is a long list of articles dedicated to unveil its meaning ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in spite of that ,",
    "the newtonian limit in cylindrical models agrees well with observations @xcite .    due to the non - triviality of the topological parameters which arise naturally in this symmetry ,",
    "their study may help to reveal some internal features of the theory of general relativity , which are not present in spherical symmetry , such as the gravitational analogue of the aharonov - bohm effect , where particles constrained to move in a region where the riemann tensor vanishes can , however , have physical effects arising from non - zero curvature in a region from which they are excluded @xcite .",
    "general relativistic cylindrical systems have also been used to improve our compreehention about many other astrophysical situations such as : the dragging of spacetime due to rotation which produces new topological defects @xcite ; exact models of rotation @xcite ; topological cosmic strings that might have been formed in the early stages of the universe @xcite ; models for extragalactic jets @xcite ; gravitational collapse @xcite and its eventual gravitational radiation @xcite ; translating fluids with cylindrical symmetry @xcite have been used to study beams of light that might be produced by stars @xcite .",
    "supernovae observations @xcite have motivated the inclusion of a positive cosmological constant @xmath4 in the efes .",
    "physically , this constant is often interpreted as the vacuum energy or some unknown dark energy ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which may exist in the universe as a whole , and therefore having an impact on the dynamics of local gravitational systems , such solar systems and galaxies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "local gravitational systems can be modelled using symmetric exact solutions of the efes , such as the schwarzschild solution in spherical symmetry or the levi - civita ( lc ) in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "the generalisations of these solutions to include @xmath4 are known as the kottler and linet - tian ( lt ) solutions , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the lt solutions which , for @xmath9 , contain two curvature singularities and represent , at most , the gravitational field in the region between two cylindrical sources .",
    "the question of finding possible sources can be tackled using spacetime matching theory and finding the appropriate boundary hypersurfaces .",
    "spacetime matchings have already been performed with lt as the exterior @xcite and we shall use these results in order to construct the first global non - singular solution involving lt with @xmath0 .    in particular , we construct a model with an interior anisotropic fluid source , an intermediate linet - tian spacetime and an exterior containing @xmath4-dust matter .",
    "physically , this solution can model an intermediate @xmath4-vacuum medium between an astrophysical local object and a background where the object is embedded .    in this paper , we will mostly study geodesics and these can be used to model jets on cylindrically symmetric regions . in nature , jets are observed at scales ranging from sub - parsecs up to hundreds of kiloparsecs @xcite . the most often invoked process of production of these jets is the blandford - znajek @xcite in the framework of magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "more recently , a model to explain the origin and structure of jets , has been put forward based on a purely general relativistic origin @xcite .",
    "that model considers the jet originating from a penrose process @xcite in the ergosphere of a kerr black hole .",
    "the ejected particles undergo the effect of strong repulsive gravitational fields , produced by the kerr black hole , and follow geodesics that collimate them .",
    "the solution presented here can represent a very simple and approximated model to that region , e.g. on an extra galactic scale , since a jet typically emerges outwards from the centre of the galactic disc , and perpendicular to it .",
    "then , we can have the material ejected from some rotating massive and compact central object , or another alternative mechanism , forming a cylindrical flow , confined by the layer of a lt vacuum . in this context ,",
    "the possible relevance of our setting is not to show the origin of jets , but to show whether the cylindrical symmetry can furnish a purely gravitational contribution to explain the collimation of the ( extragalactic ) jets .",
    "since geodesics describe the orbits of light rays and material particles , an important aspect , from both the physical and mathematical points of view , is the influence of the positive cosmological constant on the stability of the geodesics orbits in vacuum cylindrically symmetric systems with @xmath3 .",
    "the lt solution is the unique static @xmath4-vacuum spacetime in cylindrical symmetry and reduces to the exact vacuum case for @xmath3 , thus providing an appropriate framework to study stability problems .",
    "we shall then investigate the impact of arbitrarily small values of @xmath4 on the kinematics and dynamics of the geodesic motion , which we then compare with the @xmath3 case . in this context",
    ", whenever we talk about the geodesics stability we shall mean the stability , in the sense of bounded - unbounded orbits , with respect to changes in @xmath4 .",
    "in this aspect , this is a twin paper to @xcite , where the @xmath2 solution , which has only one singularity , has been analysed .",
    "contrary to that case , which had been previously studied @xcite , the case @xmath0 has never been analysed before .",
    "as we shall see ahead , there will be important differences in the geodesics stability with respect to the @xmath10 case , not only because of the sign change in @xmath4 , which naturally affects the dynamics , but also due to the existence of the second singularity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 , we revise the lt spacetimes and their geodesics equations and , in section 3 , we construct a globally non - singular spacetime by matching the lt solution to appropriate sources .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the particular case of circular geodesics , while section 5 concentrates on the dynamics along the @xmath11 direction .",
    "section 6 is the longest and contains the most general treatment about geodesics along the radial direction .",
    "we split our analysis into planar and non - planar as well as null and non - null geodesics . in most cases ,",
    "we illustrate our analytical results with plots of numerical examples . throughout",
    "we use units such that @xmath12 .",
    "we recall that the lt metric with @xmath0 is given by @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath11 and @xmath18 are cylindrical coordinates , @xmath19 , the constant @xmath8 is related to the mass per unit length and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants related to the angle defects @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the spacetime description is similar to the case @xmath23 , by redefining @xmath8 @xcite , therefore we assume @xmath23 . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the metric reduces to the levi - civita metric @xcite , in which case @xmath24 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath17 lies in the range @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26 , and there are singularities at @xmath7 and @xmath27 , where the kretschmann scalar diverges . as in the @xmath28 case , one can check that there are no trapped cylinders , by using the expression ( 7 ) of @xcite .",
    "the geodesics equations for lt can also be found in @xcite and imply @xmath29 where the dot stands for differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath30 . in turn ,",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 or @xmath33 if the geodesics are , respectively , null , timelike or spacelike , and the constants @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent , respectively , the total energy of the test particle , its momentum along the @xmath11 axis and its angular momentum about the @xmath11 axis .",
    "our goal here is to construct a global non - singular solution by substituting the two singularities of the lt spacetime with appropriate sources .",
    "the procedure will involve matching the lt metric to an interior metric at some constant value of @xmath17 , say @xmath37 , and to an exterior metric at some @xmath38 , with @xmath39 .",
    "it is already known that lt matches with the einstein static universe @xcite and with a conformally flat source @xcite . however",
    ", none of these solutions can , alone , provide the two sources of lt .",
    "we shall then consider the former as the exterior to be matched at @xmath38 and the latter as the interior matched at @xmath37 .",
    "in particular , we shall have to ensure the consistency of the model since the interior and exterior will also be related through the ( local ) matching conditions at both ends .",
    "the matching of any two @xmath40 spacetimes @xmath41 with non - null boundaries @xmath42 requires the identification of the boundaries , i.e. embeddings @xmath43 with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is an abstract copy of either boundary .",
    "we denote coordinates in @xmath45 by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , orthonormal tangent vectors to @xmath42 by @xmath48 and normal vectors by @xmath49 .",
    "the first and second fundamental forms at @xmath42 are @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the matching ( in the absence of shells ) are : @xmath52 applying these to our case we shall consider the matching between lt with the einstein static universe ( the exterior ) at @xmath38 and with a conformally flat source ( the interior ) at @xmath37 .",

    "this is the opposite effect with respect to the @xmath2 case ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this result for @xmath75 can be understood as follows . calculating the mass per unit length @xmath123 inside a cylindrical surface @xmath124 with centre at @xmath7 by using israel s expression @xcite , which produces the newtonian limit unlike other proposals",
    ", we obtain @xcite @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the mass per unit length produced by the lc spacetime .",
    "it is clear from ( [ 1 ] ) that @xmath0 decreases the mass per unit length , as a consequence the circular geodesics have a smaller tangential velocity producing a smaller centrifugal force needed to withstand the gravitational attractive force of the source . while for @xmath2 , since it increases the mass per unit length , the centrifugal force has to be bigger , thereby increasing its tangential velocity in order to withstand the gravitational force of the source as shown in @xcite . for @xmath127 , equations ( [ g11 ] ) and ( [ g11b ] )",
    "become @xmath128 which means that , independently of the @xmath17 distance and the value of @xmath4 , the circular geodesics are null , like in the lc spacetime .",
    "for @xmath129 the geodesics are timelike but there is an upper limit for @xmath17 depending on the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath4 , so that circular geodesics can exist .",
    "this is represented in figure [ figw2 ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     an interesting difference between planar and non - planar null geodesics is that , while in the former case @xmath4 always decreases the extreme distances of the geodesics to the axis and tends to destabilise their dynamics , in the latter case the effect of @xmath4 on the geodesics orbits , for @xmath130 , depends on the relative magnitudes of @xmath131 and @xmath8 .",
    "this can be seen through ( [ 38b ] ) , as linear order effect , and in the non - linear examples of figures [ fig : geod9 ] and [ fig : geod10 ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath4 on the orbits is harder to derive explicitly for the case @xmath130 , but it becomes clear in some special subcases .",
    "for instance , for small @xmath4 , in the @xmath112 case @xmath132 \\left(\\frac{c}{l_z}\\right)^2\\rho_{lcm}^3\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and for @xmath113 @xmath133 \\left [ \\left(\\frac{l_z}{c}\\right)^2+\\epsilon+\\left(\\frac{p_z}{b}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1 } \\rho_{lcm}^3,\\ ] ] which shows , in those cases , and at linear order , how @xmath4 decreases the extreme distances @xmath134 .",
    "taking into account the analysis in @xcite and the fact that non - planar geodesics for @xmath135 are ( i ) radially confined and non - singular , for @xmath136 and @xmath137 ; ( ii ) never confined , if @xmath138 or @xmath139 , we deduce :    consider geodesics with @xmath140 .",
    "then , radially confined non - singular geodesics in lc ( @xmath3 ) are ( i ) stable against the introduction of any @xmath0 ( ii ) stable against any @xmath2 in the case of timelike geodesics , while null geodesics become unstable for @xmath2 and large enough @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the lt spacetime , which is the @xmath4-vacuum solution of the efes in cylindrical symmetry .",
    "since it is the counterpart of the schwarzschild solution in a non - spherically symmetric setting , the lt has a number of physically interesting applications , which we enumerate in the introduction .",
    "when @xmath0 , the solution contains two singularities and this is a fundamental distinguishing feature from the @xmath3 and @xmath2 cases analysed before @xcite . in order to construct a globally non - singular spacetime we have cut the @xmath0 lt metric at its two singular ends and glued it to an interior anisotropic fluid source , in one end , and to an exterior @xmath4-dust einstein universe , on the other .",
    "we have then investigated the geodesic motion on a lt spacetime with @xmath0 . to do that , we have derived asymptotic estimates for an effective potential and radial velocity functions which enabled a qualitative analysis of the geodesics system of equations .",
    "we studied the effect of @xmath4 on the geodesic orbital stability by considering the effect of @xmath4 on bounded orbits .",
    "we have found that @xmath3 planar timelike confined geodesics are unstable against the introduction of a sufficiently large @xmath4 , in the sense that the radialy bounded orbits become radialy unbounded .",
    "this instability created by @xmath4 , therefore , turns bounded geodesics in lc into unbounded geodesics in lt which can , in the latter case , be extended through the outer einstein universe and reach observers located further away from the source .",
    "however , those geodesic orbits are stable for small enough @xmath4 . furthermore , any @xmath3 non - planar radially confined geodesics also remain radially confined after the introduction of any positive @xmath4 .",
    "nevertheless , for any real value of @xmath4 , if a non - planar geodesic does not reach the central singularity in finite time , it always becomes unbounded along the axial direction .",
    "in particular , combining the results of lemma 2 and the conclusions following equations ( [ rhomrholcm ] ) and ( [ lzdiff0 ] ) , we may state that , for @xmath141 , the lt solution may represent a cylindrical layer of @xmath4-vacuum , trapping geodesic beams along the @xmath11-direction , whose thickness is decreasing with @xmath4 , at least for small values of @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , as mentioned in the introduction , we can think of the global solution studied here as an approximate model for a region where there is a jet , e.g. an extragalactic jet , faraway from the galactic disc and perpendicular to it . for @xmath142 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath4 has a similar effect concerning the maximum radius of the cylindrical layer , but the geodesics are reflected toward to the axis , reaching it in finite time .",
    "based on our results , we can then speculate that the collimation of some material jets can be reinforced by purely gravitational effects due the presence of a small positive cosmological constant .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .    for the circular geodesics presented in figure 4",
    ", we can consider @xmath143 , @xmath144 and , more realistically , @xmath145 .",
    "this gives proper radius of about @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , which would be within realistic values for some extragalactic jets ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
