    "<S> for temperatures below @xmath0 the geometrically frustrated layered quantum antiferromagnet cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 in a magnetic field perpendicular to the layers orders magnetically in a so - called cone state where the magnetic moments have a finite component in the field direction , whereas their projection onto the layers forms a spiral . modeling this system by a two - dimensional spatially anisotropic quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet with dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , we find that even for vanishing temperatures the usual spin - wave expansion is plagued by infrared divergencies which are due to the coupling between longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations in the cone state . </S>",
    "<S> similar divergencies appear also in the ground state of the interacting bose gas in two and three dimensions . using known results for the correlation functions of the interacting bose gas </S>",
    "<S> , we present a nonperturbative expression for the dynamic structure factor in the cone state of cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this state the spectral line shape of spin fluctuations exhibits singular scattering continua which can be understood in terms of the well - known anomalous longitudinal fluctuations in the ground state of the two - dimensional bose gas .    </S>",
