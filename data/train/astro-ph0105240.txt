    "the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are observed in the x - ray , optical , near - infrared , and radio , and appear to be well - described by the synchrotron blast - wave model in which the source ejects material with a relativistic bulk lorentz factor , driving a relativistic shock into the external medium ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence from the observed steepening of afterglow light curves that these ejecta are in many cases mildly to highly collimated , with opening angles @xmath2@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "global fitting of the afterglow light curves over many decades in time and frequency , in the context of this model , can be used to derive constraints on the physical parameters of the model , i.e. , the energy and opening angle of the jet , the external density , the magnetic field strength and the energy distribution of the electrons behind the shock @xcite .    in this model , the image of the afterglow is expected to appear highly limb brightened at frequencies above the peak synchrotron frequency @xmath4 , but more uniform at frequencies @xmath5 , especially below the self  absorption frequency @xmath6 ( waxman 1997 ; sari 1998 ; panaitescu & mszros 1998 ; granot , piran , & sari 1999a , b ; granot & loeb 2001 )",
    ". a measurement of the surface brightness profile ( sbp ) at several frequencies would thus provide an important test of the model . for typical parameters ,",
    "the afterglow image expands superluminally , and has an angular radius @xmath7 a few days after the grb .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this is of the same order as the angular einstein ring radius of a solar mass lens at cosmological distances , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lens mass , and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the angular diameter distances between the observer - source , observer - lens , and lens - source , respectively .",
    "thus lensing by a star along the line of sight will produce a detectable magnification over the course of a few days to weeks .",
    "the probability that any given grb will be microlensed is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the angular separation between the grb and lens in units of @xmath16 . since the original suggestion by @xcite",
    ", this application of microlensing has been studied by several authors @xcite .",
    "the well - sampled optical afterglow of grb 000301c exhibited a short time scale , nearly achromatic deviation from the nominal power - law flux decline .",
    "garnavich , loeb & stanek ( 2000 ; hereafter gls ) found that this deviation is well - fit by a model in which the afterglow was microlensed by an intervening star .",
    "however , the model they adopted for the sbp was somewhat crude : they assumed the emission arose solely from an outer ring of fractional width @xmath17 , with @xmath18 providing the best fit to the data .",
    "recently , @xcite argued that , if one adopts realistic sbps , microlensing can not explain the data .",
    "here we revisit the microlensing interpretation of this deviation .",
    "we fit the optical / infrared dataset of grb 000301c to a double - power law plus microlensing model , adopting realistic sbps , and , under the assumption that the observed deviation is indeed due to microlensing , we directly invert the light curve , obtaining a non - parametric measurement of the sbp , and compare this measurement to theoretical expectations .",
    "we will be considering the same dataset as gls , namely 104 photometric data points in the @xmath19-bands distributed as @xmath20 .",
    "these data , shown in figure 1 , are taken from the compilation of @xcite with additional photometry from @xcite .",
    "we will not consider the data in the radio regime @xcite , as the majority is not contemporaneous with the optical deviation . for more details on the grb itself and the optical , infrared and radio data ,",
    "see gls , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the magnitude , shape , and duration of the microlensing signal depends sensitively on the sbp of the afterglow @xcite .",
    "the sbp , in turn , depends on the observed frequency and the physical parameters of the shock .",
    "thus detailed measurements of a microlensed afterglow light curve can be used to constrain the physical parameters of the afterglow .",
    "however , the expected sbps in the relativistic blast - wave model can also be calculated _ a priori _ under various assumptions @xcite .",
    "thus one can alternatively use the theoretical sbps to calculate the expected microlensing signature , thereby confirming or refuting the microlensing interpretation .",
    "this was the approach taken by @xcite .",
    "we adopt both approaches here .",
    "we calculate sbps using the method described in @xcite and granot & loeb ( 2001 ) .",
    "briefly , the hydrodynamics are described by the blandford - mckee ( 1976 ; bm hereafter ) self - similar solution , assuming a power - law external density profile , @xmath21 , and a power - law number versus energy distribution of electrons with index @xmath22 , @xmath23 , just behind the shock , which thereafter evolves due to radiative and adiabatic losses .",
    "we integrate the emission over the entire volume behind the shock front .",
    "a few days after the burst the afterglow is typically in the slow cooling regime ( i.e.  a typical electron cools on a timescale larger than the dynamical time ) and the ordering of the break frequencies is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the cooling frequency @xcite .",
    "we assume that this is the case for grb 000301c , as indicated by @xcite .",
    "we consider only the sbps from frequencies @xmath26 , since after a few days the optical band is typically well above @xmath6 ( and usually also above @xmath27 ) .",
    "the spectrum consists of several power - law segments ( plss ) , where @xmath28 ( see figure 1 in granot & loeb 2001 ) . due to the self - similar nature of the hydrodynamics ,",
    "the normalized sbp within a given pls is independent of time ( though it changes considerably between different plss ) .",
    "thus , for each @xmath29 , there are 3 relevant forms for the sbp , each corresponding to a different pls : @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the corresponding values of the temporal index @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath30 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) for @xmath32 and @xmath43 ( for both @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) for @xmath34 .    the expected sbps are shown in figure 2 , for a uniform external medium @xmath37 , and a stellar wind environment @xmath38 .",
    "note that the sbp becomes more limb - brightened as the frequency goes to a higher pls , i.e.  the spectral slope @xmath44 is reduced , or as the value of @xmath29 is reduced .",
    "we fit the data of the flux as a function of time to the form of two asymptotic power - laws which join smoothly : @xmath45^{-1/s } , \\label{eqn : foft}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the `` break time , '' @xmath47 is the unlensed flux at the point where the asymptotic power laws before and after the break meet , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the indices of the flux decline , and @xmath50 is a sharpness parameter ; the larger the value of @xmath50 , the sharper the break .",
    "the magnification @xmath51 due to microlensing depends on the impact parameter @xmath15 , the radial sbp of the afterglow image , and the angular size of the afterglow in units of @xmath16 , @xmath52 here @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the time from the grb in days and @xmath55 is the value of @xmath56 after 1 day .",
    "the light curve exhibits an achromatic break at @xmath57  days .",
    "berger et al .  ( 2000 ) find that this break can be well explained by jet with @xmath37 , while panaitescu ( 2001 ) argues that a jet alone can not produce the required steepening of the light curve , and invokes a double power law electron distribution , which causes additional ( though chromatic ) steepening of the light curve if the synchrotron frequency corresponding to the break in the electron distribution crosses the optical band around @xmath46 .",
    "either way , we would expect the sbp at @xmath58 to be different than at @xmath59 . however , our best fit models give @xmath60days , while the majority of the constraints on the sbp come from times @xmath61days , where the spherical self - similar bm solution should still be applicable , resulting in the self - similar sbps described in  [ sbps ] .",
    "we will therefore adopt the simpler ( and self consistent ) working assumption that the sbp , when normalized to its average value , as a function of radius normalized to @xmath62 , is independent of time within a given pls .",
    "the model in is a function of @xmath63 free parameters : four parameters describe the shape of the broken power - law ( @xmath64 ) ; one parameter provides the normalization @xmath47 for each of @xmath65 frequency bands .",
    "however , extinction from the milky way and possibly the host galaxy itself will induce an ( uncertain ) curvature in the spectrum .",
    "indeed , as noted by @xcite and @xcite , the early optical / infrared data for grb 000301c show evidence for a curved spectrum , which may be due to extinction or is perhaps intrinsic . for simplicity , we will use a free parameter for each @xmath47 .",
    "we have also performed tests where we fit the data assuming the form @xmath66 . in general",
    "we find worse fits , though our conclusions regarding the sbps are essentially unchanged .",
    "as we show , the results for the @xmath67-band data are the same as for the full dataset , indicating that our assumption of independent @xmath47 does not bias our results . ] and two additional parameters describe the microlensing effect ( @xmath68 ) for a given sbp . considering all the data for grb 000301c in figure 1 , there are @xmath69 parameters without microlensing , and @xmath70 free parameters with microlensing using theoretically - calculated sbps . for comparison purposes , we also fit the data to the model adopted by gls : we assume that the source emission is confined to a thin ring of fractional width @xmath17 . however , we extend the model of gls by allowing the image interior to the ring to have a relative surface brightness @xmath71 referenced to the outer ring ( @xmath72 reduces to the gls model ) .",
    "this model introduces two additional free parameters .",
    "finally , we consider a non - parametric fit ( `` direct inversion '' ) to the sbp .",
    "we divide the image into @xmath73 equal - area annuli , and find the fraction @xmath74 of the total flux contributed by each bin @xmath75 . in this case",
    "the magnification is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the magnification of annulus @xmath75 .",
    "this adds an additional @xmath78 parameters ( due to the constraint that @xmath79 ) .",
    "we find the best - fit solution by minimizing @xmath80 with respect to all of these parameters .",
    "we define the @xmath81 errors on these parameters as the projection of the @xmath82 hypersurface on the parameter axes , where @xmath83 @xmath84 is the minimum @xmath80 for a given model , and @xmath85 is the number of degrees of freedom for the 104 data points . we normalize @xmath86 by the factor @xmath87 because we believe that the errors on the data points are likely underestimated , resulting in inflated values of @xmath80 .",
    "errors on the fit parameters determined using these inflated values of @xmath80 would be significantly underestimated .",
    "figure 1 shows the best fit for the double power - law model with no lensing .",
    "the best - fit parameters and @xmath81 errors for @xmath88 are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "the fit is poor : @xmath89 for @xmath90 dof .",
    "residuals from the broken power - law model are shown in figure 3 ; the systematic deviations from this model are apparent .",
    "when microlensing is included , the fit improves considerably . for the extended gls model ,",
    "we find that the data is best explained by emission solely from an outer ring of relatively small fractional width .",
    "specifically , we find best - fit parameters , @xmath91 , @xmath92 for @xmath37 and @xmath93 , @xmath94 for @xmath38 .",
    "the remaining parameters and the best - fit @xmath80 are shown in table 1 .",
    "the parameters we find differ from those of gls , and we find a @xmath95 smaller than they report . however ,",
    "when we evaluate their model fit , we recover their @xmath95 , indicating that their fit was likely a local , not global , minimum . for the fits with microlensing",
    ", we find that the sharpness parameter @xmath50 is not well constrained , but is always @xmath96 , indicating a sharp break . to avoid excessive covariances with other parameters , we fix @xmath97 for the remaining fits , thus reducing @xmath98 by one .",
    "the results are essentially identical for other values of @xmath96 . for a uniform external medium ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "for which one generally predicts more limb - brightened sbps , we find @xmath99 , and @xmath100 for @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , respectively . for the case of a wind - like medium ( @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the fits are generally worse : @xmath104 , and @xmath105 for the same frequency ranges .",
    "the deviations of these fits from the double power - law model are shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is clear that a significantly limb - brightened profile is required to fit the sharp , large deviation at @xmath106  days . for @xmath107 ,",
    "both wind and uniform external media provide satisfactory fits to the data . for @xmath102 ,",
    "the uniform medium provides a marginal fit .",
    "frequencies below the peak synchrotron frequency @xmath27 , or @xmath102 with a wind - like medium ( @xmath38 ) , result in sbps that are too uniform to fit the data .    for the non - parametric sbp fit to the data",
    ", we impose the condition that @xmath108 , and we increase the number of bins @xmath109 in the recovered sbp until @xmath80 changes by @xmath110 .",
    "we find that @xmath111 is optimal .",
    "we find @xmath112 for @xmath37 , and @xmath113 for @xmath38 , for 89 dof .",
    "the inferred surface brightnesses are shown in figure 2 , the fit for @xmath37 is shown in figure 1 , and figure 3 shows the deviations of both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 models from the best - fit double power law . the best - fit values and @xmath81 errors for the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath46 , @xmath55 , and @xmath15 are given in table 1 for all viable ( @xmath114 ) fits .",
    "although the values of @xmath95 for the direct inversion formally indicate poor fits , it is clear from figures 1 and 3 that microlensing reproduces the observed light curve shape quite faithfully , at least for limb - brightened sources .",
    "it is likely that underestimated errors contribute significantly to the inflated @xmath80 .",
    "we have also fit the @xmath67-band data only using both the sbp determined from direct inversion and the theoretically - calculated sbps .",
    "the sbp inferred from direct inversion is consistent with that found from fitting all the data ( with larger errors , of course ) .",
    "the fit is better : @xmath115 for 37 dof .",
    "fits using the theoretical sbp yield the same conclusions as the fits to the entire data set : the sbps for @xmath35 provide fits that are acceptable ( @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively , for 40 dof ) .",

    "kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) find , using a semi - analytic model , that the jet break is rather smooth , especially for a wind environment ( @xmath38 ) , and therefore inconsistent with the sharp break that we infer .",
    "however , initial results of numerical calculations of the jet break @xcite , based on a 2d hydrodynamic simulation of the jet for @xmath37 , indicate that the break can be rather sharp ( with @xmath173 for an observer along the jet axis ) , and that @xmath49 is smaller by @xmath174 compared to the simple analytic predictions mentioned above , making @xmath175 larger by a similar factor .",
    "nevertheless , the sharpness of the break still presents a serious problem for the model where the jet propagates into a stellar wind ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "also , the sbp is expected to become more uniform at @xmath176 compares to @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "since we assume that the form of the sbp relevant for @xmath160 holds all along , we underestimate the value of @xmath49 , and overestimate the value of @xmath175 accordingly is larger for @xmath102 ( for which the sbp is more homogeneous ) , compared to @xmath103 , for @xmath37 or @xmath172 , ( for which the sbp is more limb brightened ) . ] .",
    "this effect is expected to be larger for @xmath103 , where the sbp is more limb brightened to begin with .",
    "the values we obtain for @xmath175 may therefore serve as upper limits ( especially for @xmath103 ) . for the sbp fit for @xmath37 and @xmath166 , we find @xmath177 whereas based on the electron index derived from @xmath48 , the prediction is @xmath178 . for @xmath35 and @xmath37 , we find @xmath179 , which is reasonably consistent with the prediction @xmath180 .",
    "thus , assuming the break in the light curve is due to jet effects , the only scenario which provides a satisfactory explanation of the data is @xmath103 and @xmath37 . for @xmath181 , the inferred sbp is only marginally consistent with the expected profile , and the observed change in the flux indices is smaller than the theoretical expectation . for @xmath107 and @xmath38 ,",

    "all else equal , more uniform sbps will result in microlensing deviations that are shallower and broader than more limb - brightened sbps .",
