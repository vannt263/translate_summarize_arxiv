    "a chemical reaction system that is self - sustaining and collectively autocatalytic is believed to represent an important step in the emergence of early life @xcite .",
    "these systems are defined by two properties : ( i ) each molecule can be built up from a small subset of pre - existing ` food ' molecules by some reaction in the system , and ( ii ) each reaction is catalysed by some product of another reaction ( or an element of the food set ) .",
    "moreover , recent experimental work has demonstrated at least the possibility ( and viability ) of such sets @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to develop a mathematical framework that allows us to study the entire universe of possible self - sustaining autocatalytic sets , so that general results can be established , and predictions made . here",
    ", we further explore one approach ( ` raf theory ' ) which has provided a tractable and incisive tool for addressing computational and stochastic questions .",
    "raf theory grew out of two strands : stuart kauffman s pioneering work on random autocatalytic networks from the 1970s and 1980s @xcite , and analysis of the first emergence of cycles in random directed graphs by bollobas and rasmussen @xcite .",
    "both of these earlier studies were explicitly motivated by origin - of - life considerations .",
    "the approach is related to , but different from chemical organisation theory ( cot ) @xcite and other formal approaches of a similar flavour , which include petri nets @xcite , rosen s ( m ; r ) systems @xcite , and eigen and schuster s hypercycle theory @xcite .    in earlier work @xcite",
    " @xcite , @xcite we have established a series of results concerning the structure , discovery and probability of the formation of raf sets in a variety of catalytic reaction systems .",
    "when such a system contains a self - sustaining autocatalytic set ( an ` raf ' , defined below ) , this set can often be broken down into smaller rafs until we arrive at the smallest ` building block ' rafs that can not be broken down any further ( _ c.f . _ @xcite ) . in this paper , we investigate the structure of these irreducible rafs , and bounds on the size of the smallest rafs within a catalytic reaction system .    along the way , we derive some new facets of raf theory , exploring further its relationship to cot , and the related weaker notions of pseudo - rafs and co - rafs , which can be co - opted by a raf to form a larger raf system . while it is easy to determine whether a chemical reaction system contains an raf ( in which case",
    "there is a unique largest one @xcite ) , we prove that finding a smallest raf is an np - hard problem .",
    "nevertheless , the structure of the smallest ( ` irreducible ' ) rafs allows us to present efficient algorithms to find lower bounds on their size , and to determine whether a given collection contains the smallest raf in the system .",
    "we begin by recalling some definitions before proceeding to the combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of rafs .",
    "we then apply mathematical arguments and simulations to study the size and distribution of irreducible rafs in kauffman s random binary polymer model @xcite , and show that at a level of catalysis at which rafs first form , small rafs are highly unlikely .",
    "we end with a short discussion .",
    "to formalize the notion of a chemical reaction system ( crs ) , the following basic notation and definitions are useful :    * let @xmath0 be a set of _ molecule types _ : each element @xmath1 represents a different type of molecule .",
    "* let @xmath2 be a _ food set _",
    ", containing molecule types that are assumed to be freely available in the environment .",
    "* let @xmath3 be a chemical _ reaction _ , transforming a set of @xmath4 _ reactants _ ( molecule types @xmath5 ) into a set of @xmath6 _ products _ ( molecule types @xmath7 ) . in principle there is no restriction on the number of reactants or products ,",
    "although in the specific model we use ( see below ) @xmath4 and @xmath6 are at most two .",
    "* let @xmath8 be a set of ( chemically possible ) reactions .",
    "* let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote , respectively , the set of all reactants of @xmath11 and the set of all products of @xmath11 , and for any subset @xmath12 of @xmath13 , let @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "* let @xmath16 be a _",
    "catalysis set _",
    ", i.e. , if the molecule - reaction pair @xmath17 then molecule type @xmath18 catalyses reaction @xmath11 .    a _ chemical reaction system _ ( or , equivalently , a _ catalytic reaction system",
    "_ ; crs ) is now defined as a tuple @xmath19 consisting of a set of molecule types , a set of ( possible , or allowed ) reactions , and a catalysis set .",
    "based on @xcite , we can visualise a crs as a _ reaction graph _ with two types of vertices ( molecules and reactions ) and two types of directed edges ( from molecules to reactions and vice versa , and from catalysts to the reactions they catalyse ) .",
    "informally , a subset of reactions @xmath12 is an raf ( reflexively - autocatalytic and @xmath20-generated ) set if it satisfies the following property :    1 cm every reactant of every reaction in @xmath12 can be built up by starting from @xmath20 and using just reactions in @xmath12 , and so that all reactions are eventually catalysed by at least one molecule that is either a product of some reaction in @xmath12 or is an element of @xmath20 .    to define an autocatalytic set more formally , we first need to define the notion of `` closure ''",
    "informally , the closure of a set of molecule types relative to a set of reactions , is the initial set of molecule types together with all the molecule types that can be created from it by repeated application of reactions from the given set of reactions .",
    "more formally , given a crs @xmath19 , the _ closure _ @xmath21 of @xmath22 relative to @xmath23 is the ( unique ) minimal set @xmath24 that contains @xmath25 and satisfies the condition that , for each reaction @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 being a set of reactants and @xmath28 a set of products ) , @xmath29 notice that when @xmath30 the set @xmath21 is still defined , and it equals @xmath25 .",
    "our mathematical definition of raf sets is now as follows ( note that this is the definition from @xcite , which is slightly modified from the original definition in @xcite ) . given a crs @xmath19 and a food set @xmath2 , a non - empty subset @xmath23 is said to be :    * _ reflexively autocatalytic _ if , for all reactions @xmath31 , there is at least one molecule type @xmath32 such that @xmath17 ; * _ @xmath20-generated _ if @xmath33 ; * _ reflexively autocatalytic and @xmath20-generated _ ( raf ) for @xmath34 if @xmath12 is both reflexively autocatalytic and @xmath20-generated .",
    "because the union of rafs for @xmath34 is also an raf for @xmath34 it follows that any crs that contains an raf has a unique maximal raf called the ` maxraf ' ; any other raf is called a ` subraf ' of this maximal raf .",
    "we say that an raf is an _ irreducible raf _ ( or , more briefly , an ` irrraf ' ) if no proper subset is also an raf .",
    "in contrast to the uniqueness of the maximal raf , there may be many ( indeed exponentially many ) irrrafs @xcite .",
    "we have already defined the concept of being@xmath20-generated , however , it will be useful to explore this further for the following reasons :    * to better understand the distinction between rafs and ` pseudo - rafs ' ( defined shortly ) ; * to explain the link between @xmath20-generated sets and ` organisations ' in chemical organisation theory ; * to provide a characterisation that we will require later in the proof of our main stochastic theorem ( theorem  [ nosmall ] ) .    given a crs @xmath35 and a food set @xmath20 , the closure set @xmath36 has two further equivalent descriptions .",
    "firstly , it is the intersection of all subsets of @xmath37 that contain @xmath20 and that are closed relative to @xmath12 .",
    "it also has an explicit constructive definition as follows : @xmath36 is the final set @xmath38 in the sequence of nested sets @xmath39 where @xmath40 is equal to the union of @xmath41 and the set of products of reactions in @xmath12 whose reactants lie in @xmath41 , and where @xmath42 is the first value of @xmath43 for which @xmath44 .    with this in hand , we now examine the definition of @xmath20-generated sets of reactions more closely .",
    "recall from the earlier definitions that a subset of reactions @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated provided that every reactant of every reaction in @xmath12 lies in @xmath36 .",
    "note that saying @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated implies but is * strictly stronger * than the condition that the reactant of each reaction in @xmath12 is either a molecule in @xmath20 or it is a product of another reaction in @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath20-generated is also strictly stronger than requiring that the molecules of @xmath37 that are ` used up ' in maintaining the reactions in @xmath12 is precisely @xmath20 .",
    "an example that demonstrates both these strict containments is provided in fig .",
    "[ figure_x ] for the set @xmath45 , which is not @xmath20-generated ( since @xmath46 .",

    "proof : _ the equivalence @xmath56 is from @xcite ( lemma 4.3 ) and the equivalence @xmath57 is easily verified , as the ordering of @xmath13 that applies for either part , also works for the other ( from the definitions ) .",
    "thus , to establish this four - way equivalence , it suffices to show that @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .    to establish @xmath60 ,",
    "suppose that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated .",
    "we construct an ordering satisfying @xmath61 as follows : let @xmath62 denote the reactions in @xmath12 that have their reactants in @xmath20 , and for @xmath63 let @xmath64 denote the reactions in @xmath12 that have their reactants in the set @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the sequence of nested sets described in the preamble to this lemma . then take any ordering on @xmath12 for which the reactions in @xmath64 all come before @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",

    "proof : _ suppose that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated .",
    "then condition ( a ) in the theorem follows by part ( ii ) of lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] ; moreover , there exists an ordering @xmath75 of @xmath12 that satisfies the condition described in part ( iii ) of that lemma .",
    "now , if @xmath76 is an arc in @xmath72 , we must have @xmath77 , since otherwise , if @xmath78 , part ( iii ) of lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] gives : @xmath79 and the containment @xmath80 would preclude the arc @xmath76 from @xmath72 .",
    "so , if @xmath72 had a directed cycle @xmath81 , we would have : @xmath82 , a contradiction .",
    "thus if @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated , condition ( b ) in the theorem also holds .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath12 satisfies conditions ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "we first show that there exists a reaction @xmath83 that has all its reactants in @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "suppose to the contrary that this were not the case ( we will show this contradicts condition ( b ) ) .",
    "then for every reaction @xmath11 in @xmath12 , we can select a molecule @xmath85 that is a reactant of @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , by property ( a ) and the condition that @xmath85 it follows that @xmath86 is the product of some other reaction , which we will write as @xmath87 .",
    "thus , starting with any given reaction , @xmath88 , consider the alternating sequence of molecules and reactions @xmath89 that we generate from @xmath88 by setting @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath12 is finite , this sequence must have @xmath92 for some @xmath93 .",

    "this contradiction ensures there exists some molecule @xmath99 for @xmath98 $ ] for which @xmath100 .",
    "however , if the closure of @xmath20 under _ any _ set of reactions contains a molecule outside of @xmath20 , then some reaction in the collection must have all its reactants in @xmath20 ( by lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] ) .",
    "this justifies our claim that there is a reaction @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "we now use induction on @xmath101 to establish that conditions ( a ) and ( b ) imply that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated . for @xmath102 and the non - existence of a loop from this reaction to itself ( by ( b ) ) , we see that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated .",
    "therefore suppose that the implication holds for any @xmath103 satisfying ( a ) and ( b ) , and that we have @xmath104 .",
    "now , consider @xmath105 and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the reaction in @xmath12 with @xmath84 .",
    "notice that @xmath108 satisfies property ( a ) .",
    "moreover , we claim that property ( b ) also holds for @xmath108 since if @xmath109 is an arc of @xmath110 then it is also an arc of @xmath72 . to verify this ,",

    "however : @xmath112 and so @xmath113 , which implies that @xmath114 is indeed an arc of @xmath72 .",
    "consequently , the arcs of @xmath110 are a subset of the set of arcs of @xmath72 that do not contain @xmath107 and so @xmath110 can not contain a directed cycle ( or else @xmath72 would ) .",
    "thus , since @xmath108 satisfies properties ( a ) and ( b ) , it follows ( by the induction hypothesis ) that @xmath108 is @xmath115-generated , and this implies that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated .",
    "this completes the proof of the converse result .",
    "chemical organisation theory ( cot ) @xcite provides another way to study chemical reaction systems , and the concept of a ( chemical ) _ organisation _ shares two key properties with rafs : closure and self - maintenance ( for precise definitions , see @xcite , and for recent relevant results , see @xcite and @xcite ) . however , the latter concept ( ` self maintenance ' ) is defined somewhat differently : while rafs require the property of being @xmath20-generated , an organisation is defined as self - sustaining under chemical dynamics , as encoded by the stoichiometric matrix . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath116 is the stoichiometric matrix for the system , with its rows indexed by molecules and its columns by reactions , then self - maintenance requires a column vector @xmath117 with strictly positive coordinates for which : @xmath118 in words , this is the condition that the reactions can proceed at positive rates , so that the net rate of production of each molecule in the system is not less than the rate at which it is used up ( otherwise such a molecule would disappear from the system ) .",
    "this is a weaker requirement than being @xmath20-generated , since self - maintenance requires only that the system be self - sustaining once it exists , but does not address the question of whether the system could form in the first place from a set of molecules in @xmath20 ; we describe an example to illustrate this shortly .",
    "a second difference is that organisations allow but do not explicitly require reactions to be catalysed , though an extension to allow this has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "note that rafs easily extend to allow some reactions not to be catalysed by introducing a putative new element of @xmath20 to act as a catalyst for any reactions that otherwise do not require catalysis .",
    "a third important difference is algorithmic and we will discuss this shortly ( a further minor difference is that organisations are subsets of molecules , while an raf is a subset of reactions and molecules ) .",
    "the following lemma shows that there is a close but not identical relationship between @xmath20-generated sets and organisations ; part ( i ) was discovered by @xcite .",
    "given a crs @xmath119 and food set @xmath20 , consider the set @xmath120 of reactions that formally generate @xmath20 without using other molecules in @xmath37 .",
    "* if @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated then the set of molecules @xmath36 forms an organisation , for the reactions @xmath121 .",
    "* it is possible for a set @xmath122 of molecules to form an organisation for a set of reactions @xmath121 but for @xmath12 to fail to be @xmath20-generated .",
    "part ( i ) of the lemma was established in @xcite ( corollary 1 ) . here , we show how it also follows as a consequence of lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] .",
    "firstly , if @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated , then it is closed by the implication ( i ) @xmath123 ( ii ) in lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] .",
    "moreover , we may order the reactions in @xmath121 so that the reactions in @xmath124 come first ( in any order ) and so that the order of the subsequent reactions from @xmath12 is such that the reactants of each reaction are either elements of @xmath20 or products of earlier reactions  the existence of such an ordering for @xmath12 is provided by the implication ( i ) @xmath123 ( iv ) in lemma  [ lemequiv2 ] . consider the corresponding stoichiometric matrix @xmath116 .",
    "then the first non - zero element in each row of @xmath116 is + 1 .",
    "now for _ any _ real matrix with this last property , there is a strictly positive column vector @xmath117 for which @xmath125 , since if @xmath116 has @xmath126 columns , and if the largest absolute value of any negative entry of @xmath116 is @xmath127 then we can take @xmath117 to be the strictly positive vector that has its @xmath43-th coordinate given by : @xmath128 for @xmath129    part ( ii ) is established by considering the example shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_x](a ) with @xmath130 and @xmath45 . ordering @xmath122 as @xmath131 and @xmath121 as @xmath132",

    "since @xmath122 is closed relative to the six reactions , it follows that @xmath122 forms an organisation , but @xmath12 fails to be @xmath20-generated , since @xmath137 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "a further difference between cot and raf theory is that determining whether or not a crs contains a non - empty organisation is an np - complete problem ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite , section 6.2 ) , while determining whether there exists an raf ( necessarily non - empty ) within any crs can be decided by a polynomial time algorithm .",
    "we describe this now .",
    "the usual raf algorithm ( @xcite ) starts with the full set of reactions and iteratively prunes out reactions until the set stabilises . for completeness",

    "it can be shown that if @xmath144 then @xmath13 contains no raf ; otherwise , @xmath145 is the unique maximal raf contained in @xmath13 ( for further details , see @xcite ) . throughout this paper",

    "not every pseudo - raf is an raf , as the example in fig  [ figure_y ] ) shows .",
    "however , pseudo - rafs satisfy some of the properties of rafs ; in particular , the union of two or more pseudo - rafs for @xmath34 is a pseudo - raf for @xmath34 .",
    "it follows that any pair @xmath147 either contains no pseudo - raf ( in which case @xmath147 contains no raf either ) or @xmath147 has a unique maximal pseudo - raf that contains all other pseudo - rafs of @xmath34 as well as the unique maximal raf for @xmath34 .",
    "an analogous algorithm to the raf algorithm applies for constructing the maximal pseudo - raf ( when it exists ) , the only change being that @xmath148 is replaced by @xmath149 in the construction of @xmath67 from @xmath64 ( where @xmath150 is the set of products of reactions in @xmath64 ) .",
    "the raf and pseudo - raf algorithms have a similar flavour to the ` unit propagation ' method of solving the propositional logic problem ` horn - sat ' , and in @xcite we showed that horn - sat can be solved by an extension of the raf algorithm .",

    "initially , they are found in only 6 out of 1000 model instances , but with increasing levels of catalysis @xmath212 , they become more and more frequent , and their sizes seem to increase linearly with @xmath212 .",

    "it follows that if @xmath255 for @xmath256 , then @xmath257 ( and thereby @xmath258 ) converges to zero as @xmath220 , and therefore so too does the expression for the probability in ( [ sumeq ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "* comments *    * this result is interesting in the light of theorem 11 of @xcite , as the probability that the length of a first cycle is @xmath172 when a first cycle appears in a random digraph is @xmath259 , and so short cycles have considerable probability in that model .",
    "+ by contrast , when the first rafs appear , there are no small ones , since any raf requires the simultaneous satisfying of two properties : it must be reflexively autocatalytic and also @xmath20-generated ; the former property is equivalent to the existence of a directed cycle in the catalysis graph ( at least in the case @xmath260 for @xmath261 ) ; while there might be a small cycle , it is unlikely to be @xmath20-generated .",
    "* theorem [ nosmall ] provides an interesting complement to the earlier theorem  [ npthm ] , which showed that there is , in general , no efficient way to determine the size of the smallest raf in a crs .",
    "thus , it could be difficult to exclude the possibility a small raf in the binary polymer model for large values of @xmath4 , by searching for the smallest irrrafs .",
    "however , theorem  [ nosmall ] provides a theoretical guarantee that , with high probability , there will be no small rafs when they first appear within this model . *",
    "the final inequality in the proof of theorem [ nosmall ] allows us to place explicit bounds on the likely minimal size of rafs for finite values of @xmath4 .",
    "for example , for @xmath262 , the probability that there exists an raf of size 1000 when the existence of an rafs has a probability of 0.5 is less that 0.01 ( taking @xmath206 and the conservative value for @xmath235 of @xmath263 from theorem 4.1(ii ) of @xcite ) . *",
    "it is easy to show that when the rate of catalysis becomes sufficiently large , we will expect to find small rafs in the binary polymer model .",
    "thus the initially largely flat line for irrraf sizes in fig .",
    "[ fig : rafsize ] must eventually decrease to small values ( in the limit of size 1 ) as the rate of catalysis continues to increase .",
    "moreover , small catalytic reaction systems ( of size 16 ) that form rafs ( and which contain even smaller rafs ) have recently been discovered in real rna replicator systems @xcite . that such small sets form rafs can be partly explained by the high catalysis rate @xcite .      with theorem [ npthm ] above , we proved that finding the smallest ( irr)raf set is a hard problem , so we can not hope to have a polynomial time algorithm to do this .",
    "however , it is still possible to get an idea of the distribution of the sizes of the irrraf sets that exist inside an raf set .",
    "this can be done as follows . in @xcite",
    ", we described a polynomial time algorithm for finding one possible irrraf in a given raf @xmath12 by removing one reaction @xmath97 from @xmath12 and applying the raf algorithm to the set @xmath264 .",
    "if this results in an empty set ( @xmath265 ) , then reaction @xmath97 is essential and needs to remain in @xmath12 . otherwise ,",
    "replace @xmath12 by the non - empty subraf @xmath266 .",
    "now repeat this procedure with every next reaction @xmath97 in @xmath12 until all reactions have been considered .",
    "the result of this is an irrraf of @xmath12 .",
    "this algorithm was used to generate the data on irrraf sizes in fig . [",
    "fig : rafsize ] .",
    "note that the particular irrraf in @xmath12 that is found by this algorithm depends on the order in which the reactions @xmath267 are considered for possible removal .",
    "so , by repeating the above algorithm a number of times and randomly re - ordering the reactions in @xmath12 each time , we can generate a sample of irrrafs of @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : irrraf ] shows two histograms of the sizes of 1000 irrrafs generated this way from two of the raf sets that were found at a level of catalysis of about @xmath211 , i.e. , when raf sets are just starting to show up .    in both cases ,",
    "the sample is dominated by one particular irrraf size , with the rest being relatively close in size , although the histogram on the right shows a case where the smallest irrraf is about 100 reactions smaller than the dominant one . since this is only a random sample ,",
    "there is no guarantee that this is indeed the _ smallest _ irrraf .",
    "however , the fact that even the smallest irrraf in these samples is still rather large ( close to 600 reactions ) is probably a good indication that , indeed , there are no small rafs when they just start appearing .",
    "raf theory provides a way to address one aspect of the complex question , how did life arise ?",
    "the existence of rafs does not represent a sufficient condition , but it would seem to be a necessary one . moreover , the approach is sufficiently general that it can be applied to other emergence phenomena both inside chemistry and in quite disparate fields ( for an application to a ` toy ' problem in economics , see @xcite ) .",
    "rafs are based on two key ideas  every molecule must be able to be built up from the available set of ` food ' molecules by reactions from the set , and each reaction must ` eventually ' be catalysed . here ` eventually ' refers to the fact that some reactions may need to proceed uncatalysed ( at a lower rate ) in order to get the system going , but eventually , all reactions are catalysed .",
    "a stronger requirement would be that all reactions must be catalysed by the available molecules as the system develops ( from the food molecules or products of reactions that have already occurred ) .",
    "this notion of a ` constructively autocatalytic @xmath20-generated ' ( caf ) set from @xcite seems an unnecessarily strong condition ( since reactions can generally proceed , at a lower rate , without catalysis ) and the mathematical properties of cafs ( and the probability that they form ) are quite different from rafs @xcite .",
    "a weaker requirement is that only some reactions need to be catalysed  this fits perfectly easily within the current raf framework , as we may simply formally allow a food molecule to act as a putative catalyst for those reactions .",
    "another weakening of the raf concept is to consider a closed chemical reaction system , which , once established , will continue to be self - maintaining . this underlies the notion of an ` organisation ' in chemical organisation theory .",
    "the property of rafs of being @xmath20-generated was shown in @xcite to imply the property of being an organisation ; we have shown here that the converse need not hold  in other words , an organisation may not be able to be built starting just with the food set , without the presence of some other reactant to get it started .",
    "this property of an organisation has a superficial similarity to the property that a raf can allow one or more some reactions to proceed uncatalysed until the catalyst is formed .",
    "however , there is an important difference , since an uncatalysed reaction can proceed ( at a lower rate ) , while this a reaction that lacks one of its reactants can not take place .",
    "the focus of this paper has been on small rafs , as these are , in some sense , the ` simplest ' systems that could be of interest in origin - of - life studies .",
    "it is of interest to know whether within some crs that harbours an raf , there is a very small one present , or instead whether all subrafs are quite large .",
    "the smallest rafs are irreducible , though not all irreducible rafs are of the smallest size .",
    "in contrast to the maximal rafs , where there is a unique object ( maxraf ) that can be constructed in polynomial time ( by the raf algorithm ) , there may be exponentially many irreducible rafs , and finding a smallest raf is , in general , np - hard .",
    "nevertheless , we can find irrrafs in polynomial time , and we can describe computable lower bounds on the size of irrrafs and also determine if a given ( small ) collection comprises all the irrrafs .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the size and distribution of rafs in simple settings such at the binary polymer model , where simulations suggest that when rafs first appear , small irrrafs are unlikely , a result that has been verified formally in theorem  [ nosmall ] .",
    "however , as the level of catalysis increases , one is guaranteed to eventually find small irrrafs .",
    "an interesting problem for future work would be to develop better bounds and approximations for the minimal size of a raf within a catalytic reaction system . for example , is it possible to obtain a bound for the size the smallest raf that is within some constant factor of optimal ?",
    "it would also be of interest to investigate an extension of rafs that allow some molecules to not only catalyse some reactions , but also to inhibit other reactions ; in this case determining whether an analogue of an raf exists within an arbitrary crs has been shown to np - hard @xcite , but in certain cases the raf algorithm can be adapted to solve this problem @xcite .",

    "this completes the proof .      _",
    "proof : _ min - raf is clearly in the complexity class np , since one can verify in polynomial time if a given subset of @xmath13 has size , at most , @xmath172 and forms an raf .",
    "we will reduce the graph theory problem vertex cover to min - raf . recall that for a graph @xmath329 , a _",

    "this is a well - known np - complete problem @xcite ( indeed , one of karp s original 21 np - complete problems ) .",
    "given an instance @xmath333 of vertex cover , we show how to construct an instance @xmath334 , of min - raf for which the answers to the two decision problems are identical .",
    "we first construct @xmath335 and @xmath336 .",
    "for each @xmath337 , let @xmath338 be two distinct elements of @xmath335 and let @xmath339 be an element of @xmath340 .",
    "order @xmath341 as @xmath342 and for each @xmath343 , let @xmath344 be a distinct element of @xmath20 and @xmath345 an element of @xmath340",
    ". let @xmath346 be another distinct element of @xmath335 .",
    "thus @xmath335 consists of the @xmath347 elements : @xmath348 and @xmath340 consists of @xmath349 elements : @xmath350    for each @xmath351 , define a reaction : @xmath352 for each @xmath353 , define the reaction : @xmath354 and for @xmath355 , let : @xmath356 for any subset @xmath357 of @xmath332 let : @xmath358 @xmath359 and set @xmath360      * if @xmath364 ( where @xmath365 ) then @xmath366 is catalysed by both @xmath367 and @xmath368 ( but by no other molecules ) . * in addition , each reaction @xmath369 is catalysed by @xmath370 and by no other molecule - we call the molecule @xmath370 the _ super - catalyst_.        * @xmath362 is an raf for @xmath371 . *",

    "* the vertex covers of @xmath330 of size @xmath42 are in one - to - one correspondence with the sub - rafs of @xmath362 of size @xmath374 .      to establish the second claim ,",

    "thus , @xmath12 is reflexively autocatalytic , and it is also clear that @xmath12 is @xmath20-generated ; thus @xmath12 is an raf and it has @xmath374 reactions .",
    "conversely , suppose that @xmath108 is an raf for @xmath371 of size at most @xmath374 .",
    "if @xmath378 is not in @xmath108 then the super - catalyst is not produced by any reaction in @xmath108 so none of the reactions in @xmath379 is catalysed ; moreover , because the products from these last reactions provide the only catalysts for @xmath375 it follows that @xmath380 .",
    "thus , since @xmath108 is non - empty ( being an raf ) , @xmath377 must be an element of @xmath108 , and in order to construct the reactants of @xmath381 , all the reactions @xmath375 must form a subset of @xmath108 . in order for all these reactions to be catalysed , at least one of the reactions @xmath382 and @xmath383 must lie in @xmath108 for each @xmath384 .",
    "thus @xmath385 is a vertex cover of @xmath330 and it has size , at most , @xmath386 as claimed .",
    "this establishes the required reduction , and thereby completes the proof of the second claim .",
    "the third claim follows by the noting that the association @xmath387 maps vertex covers of @xmath330 of size @xmath42 onto sub - rafs of @xmath362 of size @xmath374 ( by the previous claim ) and two different vertex covers are mapped to distinct sub - rafs .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "part ( i ) of theorem  [ npthm ] now follows from the first two claims , while part ( ii ) of theorem  [ npthm ] follows from the third claim , combined with the # p - completeness of counting vertex covers of a graph and minimum vertex covers of a graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "* remark : * we have ensured in the proof above that each reaction has just two reactants , in line with the binary polymer model . however , the attentive reader will notice that @xmath20 may have to be quite large .",
    "nevertheless , it is quite straightforward to modify this example so that @xmath20 is kept small ( e.g. of size 6 ) , and to implement the construction within the constraints of the binary polymer cleavage  ligation model ."
