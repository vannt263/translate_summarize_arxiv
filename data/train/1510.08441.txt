    "ep is also well - known as ky fan inequality @xcite .",
    "it is very general in the sense that it includes many mathematical models as : variational inequalities , optimization problems , fixed point problems , nash equilirium point problems , complementarity problems , operator equations , see , for instance @xcite . a special case for the bifunction @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a operator",
    ", then ep becomes the variational inequality problem : find @xmath4 such that @xmath9 one of the most popular methods for solving eps is the proximal point method ( ppm ) in which solution approximations are based on the resolvent @xcite of equilibrium bifunctions @xcite .",
    "ppm was first introduced by martinet @xcite for variational inequalities , and then it was extended for finding zero points of maximal monotone operators by rockafellar @xcite .",

    "ep ( [ ep ] ) is vip ( [ vip ] ) then ( [ a2013 ] ) becomes the following hybrid algorithm @xmath16 which was proposed by nadezhkina and takahashi in 2006 for variational inequalities and nonexpansive mappings @xcite .",
    "some modifications of ( [ nt2006a ] ) were known as the subgradient extragradient algorithm @xcite in which the second projection onto @xmath1 was replaced by one onto a halfspace in hilbert spaces and the self - adaptive subgradient extragradient algorithm @xcite in euclidean spaces .    in the algorithms ( [ qmh2008 ] ) , ( [ a2013 ] ) and others @xcite",
    ", we see that two optimization programs onto the feasible set @xmath1 must be solved at each iteration .",
    "this seems to be costly and might seriously affect the efficiency of used methods if the structure of the constrained set @xmath1 is complex . to avoid solving the second optimization program in ( [ a2013 ] ) and the condition of lipschitz - type continuity posed on the bifunction @xmath3 , strodiot et al .",
