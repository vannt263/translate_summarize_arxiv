    "the determination of parameters like critical exponents from finite size scaling @xcite is plagued by the appearance of corrections to scaling .",

    "the binder cumulant q= behaves at the critical point like [ qfss ] q(l)= q^ * + q l^- +  @xmath9 denotes the magnetization per spin .",

    "if they have non - negligible coefficients in front of them , they can hamper or even make impossible a reliable determination of the infinite @xmath8 behaviour .    in the language of the renormalization group the presence of strong corrections to scaling",
    "is related to the fact that one is far away from the renormalization group fixed point .    in this article",
    ", we summarize the results of our attempt to improve the scaling properties of the 3d ising model by suitably tuning the parameters in a two - coupling spin-1 model that has already been studied by blte et al .  @xcite",
    ".    we will be mainly interested in the determination of the exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 that will be obtained from the scaling laws ( @xmath14 ) = a_i l^1/ ( 1 + b_i l^- +  ) and [ chifit1 ] = c + l^2- ( 1 + d l^- +  ) . here , @xmath15 denotes the cumulant introduced above , and @xmath16 is the ratio of partition functions @xmath17 , where the subscripts label periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , respectively .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions are applied in one of the three lattice directions only .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath18 is defined by = l^3 m^2 .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a spin-1 ising model on a simple cubic lattice defined through s = - _ < i , j > s_i s_j + d _ i s_i^2 .",
    "the @xmath19 take values @xmath0 , and the spin - spin interaction is a sum over all nearest neighbour pairs .",
    "the boltzmann factor is given by @xmath20 .",
    "blte et al .",
    "chose a fixed @xmath21 , and varied @xmath22 to tune to criticality .",
    "we followed a different procedure , to be described in some detail elsewhere . from prior simulations @xcite ,",
    "estimates of the universal quantities @xmath23 were available , namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "for a number of lattice sizes @xmath26 ranging from 3 to 14 a sequence of couplings @xmath27 was determined such that @xmath28 within the statistical accuracy .",
    "as @xmath8 increases the pair @xmath27 converges to a point where leading order corrections to scaling vanish . from our numerical results we extrapolate to @xmath29 .",
    "we found that this point is approached on the line [ critline ] d -2.04 + 6.95 .",
    "it turns out that eq .",
    "( [ critline ] ) is an approximation to the critical line .",
    "it is reassuring that the estimate @xmath30 , together with @xmath31 in @xcite is close to this line .",
    "our next goal was to approximately identify a second one - dimensional submanyfold of the 2-coupling space , namely that where the leading correction to scaling vanishes .",
    "this was possible by fitting the derivatives of the @xmath32 at @xmath33 with respect to the two coupling parameters to a certain linear equation .",
    "details will be reported in @xcite .",
    "our fit results suggested that the critical line should be approached by varying @xmath22 while adjusting @xmath34 according to [ goodline ] d = 3 ( -0.3832 ) + 0.6241 . a first estimate for @xmath35",
    "was then obtained applying the well established method looking for the crossings of @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "we used lattices of size @xmath38 and obtained @xmath39 , with @xmath34 given by eq .",
    "( [ goodline ] ) , i.e.  @xmath40 .",
    "this is significantly different from the @xmath31 used in ref .",

    "we simulated on cubic lattices with linear extension @xmath8 ranging from 4 to 56 .",
    "state of the art cluster algorithms were employed .",
    "two measurements were separated by three single cluster updates . for the computation of @xmath17 a variant of the boundary flip cluster algorithm @xcite was implemented .",
    "the runs for the determination of the critical parameters described in the previous section took about 3 months of cpu on pentium 166-mmx pcs , while the final production runs consumed a total of 1 year .",
    "the data relevant for the present article are summarized in tables [ zqx ] and [ deri ] .",
    "table [ zqx ] gives the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath14 and @xmath43 .",
    "in addition , we quote the number of measurements in the last column . in table [ deri ] we give the estimates of the partial and total derivatives of the @xmath42 with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ goodline ] ) implies @xmath44 the quantities in table  [ deri ] are multiplied by a factor @xmath45 , which compensates to good precision for the leading divergent behaviour with increasing lattice size .    by a reweighting technique we have access also to the same set of observables at a set of four neighbouring @xmath22 values , ranging from 0.383225 to 0.383265 in steps of 0.000010 .",

    "we have demonstrated that the spin-1 ising model with suitably chosen coupling constants has remarkably improved finite size scaling properties .",
    "this allowed us to obtain high precision estimates for the critical indices @xmath12 and @xmath13 and two other universal quantities , the binder cumulant @xmath46 and the ratio of partition functions @xmath17 .",

    "our estimate for the cumulant , @xmath47 may be compared with the one given in @xcite , namely @xmath48 .",
    "of course , one could also search for even further reduction of corrections to scaling by refining our procedure or choosing variants of the model , e.g. , the @xmath49-model or an ising model with more couplings .",
    "last but not least , application of the ideas underlying the present analysis to other models seems promising ."
