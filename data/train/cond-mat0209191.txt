    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite in cuprates and the subsequent `` research rush '' have led to the appearance of about 100  000 papers to date  @xcite .",
    "virtually every fundamental process known in condensed matter physics was probed as a possible mechanism of this phenomenon .",
    "nevertheless , none of the theoretical efforts resulted in a coherent picture  @xcite .",
    "for the conventional superconductors the mechanism was known to be the interaction between electrons and crystal - lattice vibrations , but the development of its theory lagged behind the experimental findings .",
    "the case of cuprate high-@xmath2  superconductivity appears to be the opposite : we do not convincingly know which mechanism is to be incorporated in the traditional bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite .",
    "thus the path to high-@xmath2  superconductivity in cuprates , perhaps carefully hidden or well - forgotten , has turned into one of the long - standing mysteries in physical science .",
    "features of the electronic spectrum of the @xmath8  plane , ( a ) , the structural detail responsible for the superconductivity of the cuprates , have become accessible from the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite .",
    "thus , any theory which pretends to explain the cuprate superconductivity is bound to include these features and account for them consistently .",
    "a number of extensive reviews over the past years have been devoted to that theoretical problem  @xcite .",
    "for further related discussion we also refer the reader to the review  @xcite on nmr - nqr spectroscopies in high-@xmath2superconductors .",
    "in contrast with all previous proposals , we have advanced in reference  @xcite the _ intra - atomic _",
    "exchange  @xcite of two electrons between the 4s and 3d@xmath1 states of the cu atom as the origin of high-@xmath2superconductivity in the layered cuprates and have shown that the basic spectroscopic and thermodynamic experiments can be explained by it . previously only _",
    "inter - atomic _ heitler - london - type  @xcite two - electron exchange  @xcite has been discussed .",
    "thus , the present work is the unabridged version of our theory announced in reference  @xcite .",
    "it builds upon the standard bloch - hckel  @xcite ( tight - binding ) approximation to the electronic band structure of the @xmath8  plane , developed in an earlier work  @xcite .",
    "we derive an analytical expression for the bcs kernel , or pairing potential @xmath9 for the case of the s - d pairing the analytical solution is compared to the arpes data .",
    "extensive discussion is also provided to help the juxtaposition of our theory with other models .",
    "finally , exact expressions within the s - d model are given for the specific heat , london penetration depth , cooper - pair effective mass and hall constant of the vortex - free meissner - ochsenfeld phase .",
    "the electronic properties of materials are strongly influenced by the local environment and in this sense the electronic features are local physics .",
    "the simplest possible model for high-@xmath2  superconductivity contains single - particle and correlated two - electron hoppings between nearest neighbours and next - nearest neighbours .",
    "formally , this is an expansion of the many - particle hamiltonian containing two- and four - fermion operators .",
    "the two - fermion hamiltonian determines the band structure , briefly considered in subsection  [ sec : tfbmn ] , while the four - fermion terms ( subsection  [ sec : hl ] ) determine the pairing interaction , and lead to the gap equations considered in section  [ sec : rh ] .",
    "every high-@xmath2  superconductor has its specific properties .",
    "it is strongly believed , however , that the main features of the electronic band structure of the @xmath8  plane are adequately described by the four - band model spanning the @xmath10 , , o  2p@xmath3 and o  2p@xmath4 orbitals , ( b ) . in the spirit of the bloch - hckel ( bh ) model , using jordan s second quantization language , we introduce fermi annihilation operators for an electron with spin projection @xmath11 at a particular orbital , respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the unit cell with index @xmath14 it is convenient to introduce a multicomponent fermi creation operator in momentum space , @xmath15 . in this notation",
    "the one - electron bh hamiltonian reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the chemical potential , and ( cf .",
    "reference  @xcite ) @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the single - site energies of the @xmath10 , , o  2p@xmath3 and o  2p@xmath4 states , respectively .",
    "the hopping amplitudes between these states are @xmath22 , @xmath23  and @xmath24 , ( b ) .",
    "note , that because of the orbital orthogonality @xmath25 . for brevity ,",
    "we have introduced also the notation @xmath26    plane .",
    "the shaded square is the unit cell indexed by @xmath27 .",
    "( b ) the lcao basis set : a single electron hops from the 3d atomic orbital to 2p@xmath3 with amplitude @xmath23 , contained in @xmath28 . from 2p@xmath3 to 2p@xmath4 the hopping amplitude is @xmath24 , and from there to 4s the hopping amplitude is @xmath22 .",
    "correlated hopping of two electrons in opposite directions between 3d and 4s with amplitude @xmath0  is depicted as a double arrow ( see the discussion in sections  [ sec : sd ] and [ sec : signj ] ) .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ]    from a classical point of view , the @xmath10  state corresponds to a circular electron rotation in the @xmath8  plane while the state corresponds to a classical ensemble of electrons of zero angular momentum continuously falling to the nucleus .",
    "pictorially , the s - electrons fall to the nuclei like comets , but after the impact the turning point of their motion is very far from the nucleus .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath22  is considerably larger than @xmath23 .",
    "the transfer amplitude @xmath24  is the smallest one since the hopping to the next - nearest neighbour requires a tunnelling through free space . as a rule ,",
    "the electron band calculations significantly overestimate @xmath24 , but the latter can be reliably calculated using the surface integral method , cf .",
    "reference  @xcite . even for the largest transfer integrals @xmath22and @xmath23 , which determine the bandwidth of the conduction band ,",
    "the _ ab initio _ calculations give a factor 2 or even 3 `` overbinding '' .",
    "nonetheless , the band calculations substantiate this choice for the lcao ( linear combination of atomic orbitals ) basis set and provide an adequate language for interpretation . in the end , these parameters should be determined by fitting to the spectroscopy data and be treated in the model lattice hamiltonian as phenomenological parameters of the microscopic many - body theory .",
    "we shall briefly recall some basic properties of the four - band model as derived in reference  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 be the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the bh hamiltonian , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the band index . for the `` standard model '' ,",
    "@xmath33 the lowest energy band , @xmath34 is an oxygen bonding band having a minimum at the @xmath35 point . the next band",
    ", @xmath36 is a narrow `` nonbonding '' oxygen band with an exactly ( within the framework of the model ) zero dispersion along the @xmath37-@xmath38 direction , i.e. , this band is characterized by an extended van hove singularity .",
    "the conduction band , @xmath39 , is a nearly half - filled @xmath10  band with the analytical eigenvector @xmath40 where the @xmath41 s denote the energies measured relative to their respective atomic levels : @xmath42 @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the topmost band , @xmath46 , is an empty  band . in elemental metals like cu and fe ,",
    "the 4s band is a wide conduction band , but for the @xmath8  plane it is completely `` oxidized '' . having the analytical eigenvector we can calculate the corresponding eigenvalue : @xmath47 if necessary ,",
    "the nonorthogonality of the atomic orbitals at neighbouring atoms can be easily taken into account . in this case",
    "the normalizing denominator in the above equation reads ( for arbitrary band index ) @xmath48 where the `` metric tensor '' @xmath49 is given by the integral @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the atomic wave functions , and @xmath53 is the inter - atomic distance .",
    "the phases are chosen such that all overlap integrals @xmath54",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 be positive parameters , like the hopping integrals @xmath57 @xmath58 and @xmath59 note that these provisions apply only to the single - particle spectrum . as long as one deals with a single conduction band , all bloch states are orthogonal and the further treatment of the second - quantized hamiltonian proceeds in the standard way .    thus , using the rayleigh quotient iteration for equations   one can obtain numerically the eigenvalue and the eigenvector .",
    "the band energies @xmath60 satisfy the secular equation @xmath61 where the energy - dependent coefficients read  @xcite : @xmath62 furthermore we introduce the normalized eigenvector @xmath63 and write the noninteracting hamiltonian in diagonal form , @xmath64 the fermi operators in real - space representation can be easily expressed using the band representation , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of unit cells , and the two phases in the right - hand side of the equation read @xmath67 and @xmath68 this transformation will be used in the next subsection for deriving the interaction hamiltonian .",

    "the case of a strong electron correlation implies that @xmath87 could be of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "thus , one can expect that the following inequalities hold true @xmath88    in fact , the s - d exchange is the basic process responsible for the magnetism of transition metals ; see for example reference  @xcite .",
    "it was understood since the dawn of quantum physics that the mechanism of ferromagnetism  @xcite is the two - electron exchange owing to the electron correlations  @xcite .",
    "here we shall add a few words in retrospect concerning the two - electron correlation parameterized by @xmath87 in .",
    "probably the first two - electron problem was bohr s consideration of the he atom  @xcite ( cf .",
    "references @xcite ) in which two electrons have opposite coordinates @xmath89 and momenta @xmath90 . for a purely radial motion ,",
    "such a fall to the nucleus is stable and many years after bohr s prediction double rydberg states , with an effective @xmath91 were discovered by electron energy loss spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "these double rydberg states with opposite electron momenta can be considered as proto - forms of the cooper pairs .",
    "interestingly , in 1914 , sir  j  j  thomson proposed  @xcite ( cf . also the textbook  @xcite ) that electric charge can propagate as electron doublets  another proto - form of the local ( ogg - schafroth ) pairs  @xcite .",
    "before the appearance of quantum mechanics , lewis  @xcite and langmuir  @xcite introduced the idea of electron doublets in order to explain the nature of the chemical bond .",
    "nearly at the same time parson  @xcite came to the conclusion that `` an electron is not merely an electron charge but a small magnet '' or in his terminology `` a magneton '' , cf .",
    "reference  @xcite .",
    "later , in 1926 , lewis introduced also the notion of a photon  @xcite without any reliable theoretical background at the time .    in the era of new quantum mechanics heitler and london  @xcite",
    "realized the idea of electron doublets  @xcite and convincingly demonstrated how the two - particle correlation owing to a strong coulomb repulsion can lead to a decrease of the energy , and by virtue of the hellmann - feynman theorem , to inter - atomic attraction for the singlet state of the electron doublet .",
    "the original heitler - london calculation , which is nowadays interpreted in every textbook in quantum mechanics and/or quantum chemistry , gives indeed a wrong sign of the exchange energy for very large inter - atomic distances but , in principle , there are no conceptual difficulties in the heitler - london theory .",
    "the exchange energy @xmath92 was represented  @xcite as a surface integral in the two - electron six - dimensional space @xmath93 and this was shown to be an asymptotically exact result , cf .",
    "also reference  @xcite .",
    "the surface integral method gives amazingly accurate results ( cf . the excellent monograph by patil and tang  @xcite ) even if the exchange energy is of the order of the energies typical for solid state phenomena .",
    "unfortunately , this method , that ought to be applied to _ ab initio _ calculated ( e.g. , from density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite ) wave functions , is barely known in the solid state community ( although a very recent work by gorkov and krotkov  @xcite indicates that it is not completely forgotten ) .",
    "this is one of the reasons why the @xmath94 and @xmath92 transfer integrals have been treated phenomenologically just as fitting parameters of the theory . a valuable discussion on a similar scope of ideas has recently been given by brovetto , maxia and salis  @xcite but it may well not be the only case . in order to ease comparison of the hl hamiltonian with the other types discussed in the search of a theory of high-@xmath2  superconductivity we shall rewrite it in terms of spin variables .",
    "the grounds for our theory have been set first by schubin and wonsowsky and later in more clear notions and notation by zener  @xcite .",
    "the s - d two - electron exchange is the intra - atomic version of the hl interaction .",
    "both of those 4-fermion interactions due to heitler - london & schubin - wonsowsky - zener can in principle mediate superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "let us introduce the spin operator @xmath95 and particle number operator @xmath96 for each atomic orbital , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the pauli sigma matrices , and the first two formulae imply summation over the spin indices .",
    "introducing also the spin exchange operator @xmath100 @xmath101 we can rewrite the hl hamiltonian _ per bond _ as  @xcite @xmath102 we should stress that in the @xmath94-@xmath92 model the term @xmath103 enters with negative sign  @xcite .",
    "let us also provide the `` mixed '' representation : @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 . note that ( [ eq : bond ] ) implies a purely orbital motion without spin flip : two electrons exchange their orbitals and only the spin indices reflect this correlated hopping . for @xmath107",
    "the hl hamiltonian has a singlet ground state @xmath108 with eigenvalue @xmath109 the lowering in energy of the singlet state , having a symmetric orbital wave function , is of purely kinetic origin related to the delocalization of the particles at different orbitals .",
    "symbolically , the `` location '' of the ( approximately ) localized electron doublet(s ) in the structure signature of a molecule is designated by a colon , e.g. , h : h for the h@xmath110 molecule .",
    "this lewis notation for the valence bond with energy @xmath111 ( or four - fermion terms in the second quantization language ) is an important ingredient of the chemical intuition . in principle , such an exchange lowering is expected to exist for bose particles as well . for electrons , however , we have triplet excited states @xmath112 with eigenvalue @xmath92 . in the present work we consider the parameter @xmath92 to be _ positive",
    "if it corresponds to antiferromagnetism , or pairing in the singlet channel_. thus the singlet - triplet splitting for the single - bond hl hamiltonian ( [ eq : bond ] ) is @xmath113 .",
    "similarly , the bonding - antibonding splitting for the single - particle hopping hamiltonian @xmath114 is @xmath115 and the energy threshold for creation of a pair of normal carriers , considered in the next section , is @xmath116 . besides stemming from bare",
    "inter- and intra - atomic processes , two - electron hopping amplitudes @xmath92 can be created by strong correlations  @xcite within the hubbard model .",
    "for a nice review on this subject the reader is referred to the work by spalek and honig  @xcite .",
    "substituting the fermi operators @xmath117 equation  ( [ eq : space ] ) , into equation  ( [ eq : interaction ] ) one obtains the hl interaction hamiltonian in a diagonal band representation . for the case of zero electric current  @xcite ,",
    "solely the reduced hamiltonian @xmath118 including creation and annihilation operators with opposite momenta only , has to be taken into account : @xmath119 for singlet superconductors it is necessary to take into account the pairing with opposite spins , thereby the _ total reduced _ hamiltonian reads @xmath120 where @xmath121 are the band energies measured from the chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "hence the bcs equation  @xcite for the superconducting gap takes the familiar form @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the quasiparticle energies and @xmath124^{-1}$ ] are the fermi filling factors with @xmath125 the boltzmann constant , and @xmath126 the temperature . the summation over the band index @xmath127",
    "should be restricted to the partially filled ( metallic ) bands , comprising sheets of the fermi surface . applying this standard procedure to the hl hamiltonian ( [ eq : interaction ] ) , and after some algebra",
    ", we obtain the desired bcs pairing kernel , @xmath128 where @xmath129 as the band indices @xmath130 and @xmath127 enter implicitly in the band energies @xmath29 in the equation for the eigenvectors @xmath131 , we will suppress them hereafter .",
    "the layered cuprates , admittedly , have a single conduction band and their fermi surface has the shape of a rounded square . in this simplest case one has to solve numerically the nonlinear integral equation @xmath132 the solution to this general gap equation , depending on the @xmath87 values , can exhibit s , p , or d - type symmetry . it has been shown previously that a purely p - p model  @xcite ( @xmath133 ) results in a @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) gap anisotropy . however , we found that an agreement with the experimentally observed @xmath136 ( @xmath137 ) gap anisotropy ( for a review see for example reference  @xcite ) can be achieved only in the simplest possible case of a dominant s - d exchange .",
    "this separable hamiltonian deserves special attention and we will analyze it in the next sections .",

    "let us recall that already in 1962 herring  @xcite was advocating that `` antiferromagnetic @xmath87 s should be the rule , ferromagnetic @xmath87 s the exception '' .",

    "physics of magnetism certainly displays lots of subtleties , but for a qualitative comparison let us trace the `` operation '' of the s - d exchange amplitude @xmath0  in the case of the simplest model for a ferromagnetic metal . while for the @xmath8  plane the s - band is empty , for transition metals it is the widest conduction band .",

    "hence we can conclude that the indirect exchange can contribute significantly to the total @xmath0amplitude responsible for the pairing .",

    "we believe that this property is preserved if the d electrons also form a conduction band , or even in the case of a single s - p - d hybridized band .",
    "we should note that kondo s argumentation for the need of a @xmath0  with an antiferromagnetic sign in the kondo effect is related to anderson s consideration of localized magnetic states in metals  @xcite . in the latter schematized model , based on the works of friedel  @xcite",
    ", anderson shows that `` any @xmath212-shift caused by free - electron polarization will tend to have antiferromagnetic sign .

    "a few parameters have to be properly taken into account : the fermi energy @xmath245 as determined from the total area of the hole fermi contour , the difference between the fermi energy and the van hove singularity , @xmath246 the difference between the van hove singular point and the bottom of the conduction band at the @xmath247 point , @xmath248 .",
    "the fit may further allow taking into account a possible realization of the abrikosov - falkovsky scenario , cf .",
    "reference  @xcite .",
    "according to the latter , for @xmath249 and sufficiently small @xmath23 , the conduction band can be the narrow ( nonbonding ) oxygen band having a perfect ( within the framework of the four - band model ) extended van hove singularity . if the superconducting gap has a @xmath137-type symmetry , its maximum value along the fermi contour , latexmath:[$\\delta_{\\max}=\\max    @xmath0  exchange integral in the s - d model .",
    "thus , the temperature dependence of the gap , described by the function @xmath251 and the overall thermodynamic behaviour and low frequency electrodynamic response will be determined without free fitting parameters .",
    "the fit to the extended van hove singularity as observed , e.g. , in reference  @xcite also points to a relatively low - lying  level and one needs to consider the minimum value of @xmath252 .",
    "although the 4s  band is completely empty (  level is above the fermi level ) , a very close location is not `` harmless '' and would necessarily lead to some prediction for the optical behaviour . with some risk of opening the pandora s box",
    ", we should mention that the lowest position of the  level is determined by the mid - infrared ( mir ) response . according to this possible interpretation ,",
    "the broadly discussed maximum of the absorption in the mir range is due to 3d-4s interband transition : one electron in the conduction band is excited by the light to the empty  band .",
    "it seems that , up to now , there is no natural explanation of this mir optical adsorbtion ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the derived gap anisotropy function  ( [ gap_exact ] ) and its interpolation  ( [ gap_interpolation ] ) compared to the arpes experiment showed that the `` standard '' four - band model spanned on the @xmath10 , , o  2p@xmath253 and o  2p@xmath4 orbitals , with an antiferromagnetic s - d pairing interaction , successfully describes the main features of the arpes data : the rounded - square - shaped fermi surface , small energy dispersion along the @xmath37-@xmath254 line , and the d - type @xmath255 symmetry of the energy gap @xmath5 along the fermi contour . according to the pairing scenario proposed here , strong electron correlations `` drive '' the electron exchange amplitudes .",
    "these inter- and intra - atomic processes occur on energy scales unusually large for solid state physics .",
    "however , the subsequent treatment of the lattice hamiltonian can be performed completely within the framework of the traditional bcs theory .",
    "the criterion for applicability of the bcs scheme is not given by the @xmath92 vs @xmath244 but rather by the @xmath2  vs @xmath256 relation .",
    "taking into account the typical arpes - derived bandwidths , which are much bigger than @xmath2 we come to the conclusion that the bcs trial wave function  @xcite is applicable for the description of superconductivity in the layered cuprates with an acceptable accuracy if @xmath2  does not significantly exceed room temperature .",
    "it is worth adding also a few remarks on the normal properties of the layered cuprates . among all debated issues in the complex physics of the cuprates ,",
    "the most important one is perhaps that of the normal - phase kinetics .",
    "the long - standing problem is whether the paring interaction dominates ( or totally determines ) the mechanism of ohmic resistance in the normal phase , as is the case for conventional superconductors . within the present theory this question",
    "can be formulated as follows : does the s - d exchange interaction dominate the scattering of the normal - state charge carriers above @xmath2 ? this is a solvable kinetic problem whose rigorous treatment will be given elsewhere .",
    "here we shall restrain ourselves in providing only a qualitative discussion .    in electron - electron scattering",
    ", just like in traffic accidents , the crucial effect comes from the backscattering in `` head - on '' collisions . for backscattering ( i.e. , @xmath257 ) in the case of s - d interaction",
    ", it turns out that the matrix elements entering the pairing amplitude are also important .",
    "it can be easily realized that this amplitude vanishes along the diagonals of the brillouin zone @xmath37-@xmath35 ( the @xmath247-m direction ) .",
    "thereby the cold spots on the fermi contour correspond to the zeros of @xmath5 . and vice versa ,",
    "the hot spots are associated with a maximum gap along @xmath35@xmath258 ( the m - x direction ) . in this sense , cuprates repeat the qualitative feature of the conventional superconductors , with a maximal gap corresponding to maximal scattering on the fermi surface .",
    "all layered cuprates are strongly anisotropic and two - dimensional models give a reasonable starting point to analyze the related electronic processes .",
    "most importantly , the picture of a layered metal brings in something qualitatively new which does not exist for a bulk metal  the `` interstitial '' electric field between the layers , like the one in any plane capacitor .",
    "the thermodynamic fluctuations of this electric field and related fluctuations of the electric potential and charge density constitute an intensive scattering mechanism analogous to the blue - sky mechanism of light scattering by density fluctuations .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated  @xcite that the experimentally observed linear resistance can be rationalized in terms of the plane capacitor scenario ; density fluctuations in the layered conductors are more important than the nature of the interaction .",
    "in such a way the linear normal - state resistivity is an intrinsic property  @xcite of the `` layered '' electron gas and can not be used as an argument in favor of non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "the resistance of the normal phase may not be directly related to the pairing mechanism and these problems can be solved separately",
    ". nevertheless it will be interesting to check whether the anisotropic scattering in cuprates  @xcite can be explained within the framework of the s - d pairing hamiltonian .",
    "the present theory can also predict a significant isotope effect in the cuprates .",
    "even though the @xmath0  pairing amplitude does not depend on the atomic mass , the charge carriers reside the ionic @xmath8  2d lattice , thereby rendering polaron effects , as in any ionic crystal , possible .",
    "for the lighter oxygen isotope the lattice polarization is more pronounced , leading to enhanced effective mass and density of states , and reducing the transfer integrals .",
    "overall , the isotope effect in the @xmath8  plane is due to the isotope effect of the density of states .",
    "this rationale can be quantitatively substantiated . in our theory , upon isotope substitution at @xmath259 , e.g. , the change of the penetration depth would be mainly driven by the cooper pair effective mass that could be determined by means of the bernoulli effect . at",
    "that the superfluid density remains unchanged .",
    "the calculation of the isotope effect on @xmath2  requires an evaluation of the polaron effects on the conduction band .",
    "although this is a feasible problem , it is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "the proposed mechanism for pairing in the @xmath8  plane can be handled much like an `` alice - in - wonderland '' toy - model , but we find it fascinating that all ingredients of our theory are achievements of quantum mechanics dating back to the memorable 1920s , presently described in every physical textbook , and constituting the fundamentals of solid state physics  @xcite",
    ". it would be worthwhile attempting to apply the approach , used in this paper , for modelling triplet and heavy - fermion superconductivity as well .",
    "we find it very instructive to analyze qualitatively the reasons for the success of the realization of high-@xmath2  superconductivity in the @xmath8  plane :    * because of the relatively narrow quasi - two - dimensional conduction d - band , due to p - d hybridization , the density of states is rather high .",
    "the wide s - band resulting from s - p hybridization is completely empty , which is somewhat unusual for compounds containing transition ions . *",
    "the pairing s - d exchange process was known since the first years of quantum physics .",
    "it is omnipresent in the physics of the transition ions but in order for it to become the pairing mechanism in perovskites it is necessary that the s- and d - levels be close . in other words ,",
    "a virtual population of the s - level is at least needed in order to make the @xmath0amplitude operative .",
    "indeed , the conduction d - band is , actually , a result of the s - p - d hybridization in the two - dimensional @xmath8  plane .    with the above remarks",
    ", one can speculate that among the perovskites the layered ones are more favorable for achieving higher @xmath2(cf .",
    "also the discussion in the appendix on page  ) .",
    "the transition ion series ends with cu@xmath260 and the @xmath10  and 4s levels are too close .",
    "one should keep in mind that the filling of the electron shells finishes with a `` robbery '' in cu  @xcite : 3d@xmath2614s@xmath262 instead of 3d@xmath2634s@xmath264 as one could expect from the electron configuration of the ni atom ( 3d@xmath2654s@xmath264 ) .",
    "however , the energy difference between these two cu shell configurations is very small .",
    "another favorable factor is the proximity of the o  2p and @xmath10  levels .",
    "post factum _ the success of cu and o looks quite deterministic : the @xmath8  plane is a tool to realize a narrow d - band with a strong s - p - d hybridization . it was mentioned earlier that @xmath0  is one of the largest exchange amplitudes , but the 4s and 3d orbitals are orthogonal and necessarily require an intermediary whose role is played by the o  2p orbital .",
    "hence this theory can be nicknamed `` _ _ the 3d - to-4s - by-2p highway to superconductivity _ _ ''  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0  amplitude is omnipresent for all transition ion compounds , the hybridization of 3d , 4s and 2p is however specific only for the @xmath8  plane .    how this qualitative picture can be employed to predict new superconducting compounds",
    "is difficult to assess immediately .",
    "we believe , however , that this picture , working well for the overdoped regime , is robust enough against the inclusion of all the accessories inherent to the physics of optimally doped and underdoped cuprates : cohabitation of superconductivity and magnetism  @xcite , stripes  @xcite , pseudo - gap  @xcite , interplay of magnetism and superconductivity at individual impurity atoms  @xcite , apex oxygen , @xmath8  plane dimpling , doping in chains  @xcite , the 41  mev resonance  @xcite , etc . perhaps some of these ingredients can be used in the analysis of triplet superconductivity in the copper - free layered perovskite sr@xmath110ruo@xmath217  @xcite .",
    "it is also likely that the superconductivity of the ruo@xmath110 plane is a manifestation of a ferromagnetic exchange integral @xmath266 the two - electron exchange mediates superconductivity and magnetism in heavy fermion compounds  @xcite as well .",
    "we suppose that lattice models similar to the approach here will be of use in revealing the electronic processes in these interesting materials .",
    "two - electron exchange may even contribute to the 30  k @xmath2  of the cubic perovskite ba@xmath267k@xmath268bio@xmath223 but so far it is difficult to separate the exchange contribution from the phonon part of the pairing interaction .",
    "however , the strange doping behaviour of tl@xmath110ba@xmath110cuo@xmath269 in comparison with ybco requires more detailed investigation  @xcite .",
    "the technological success in preparing the second generation of high-@xmath2  superconducting cables by depositing thin - layer superconducting ceramics on a flexible low - cost metallic substrate is crucial for the future energy applications .",
    "the usa department of energy suggests global superconducting energy products would command an annual market of 30  g$ by about 2020 .",
    "high-@xmath2  superconductor power cables , transformers , motors and generators could grab a 50% market share by 2013 , 2015 , 2016 and 2021 , respectively  @xcite . on the other hand atomic - layer engineering of superconducting oxides",
    "will trigger progress in materials science and electronics .",
    "one can envision multi - functional all - oxide electronics , e.g. , sensors , processing and memory devices , all monolithically integrated within a single chip  @xcite . in spite of the technological progress and tens of thousands of publications the theoretical `` _ _ picture in early 2000 remains fairly cloudy on the whole _ _ ''",
    "the landmark of `` today '' must be some event .",
    "`` what event will it be ?",
    "it is desirable that this landmark be the insight into the mechanism of superconductivity in high-@xmath2  cuprates ''  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented a traditional theory for superconductivity in overdoped , and possibly also optimally doped cuprates .",
    "all of its ingredients can be found in the textbooks and there is a considerable chance that we witness the victory of traditionalism , as it was in the history of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) half a century ago , but it may well be just a personal viewpoint `` _ _ brainwashed by feynman _ _ ''",
    "nonetheless let us use the example of qed to illustrate the essence of our contribution .",
    "qed appeared as a synthesis between perturbation theory and relativity .",
    "both components had been known well before the qed conception .",
    "similarly , both the bcs theory and the exchange interaction have been known for ages , so the point in the agenda was how to conceive out of them the theory of high-@xmath2  cuprates .",

    "it is unfortunate that theorists have not so far paid any attention to this observation because it is an important correlation between the _ ab initio _ calculated parameter @xmath303 and the experimentally measured @xmath304 which can reveal the subtle link between the experiment and the theory and finally solve the long - standing puzzle of the mechanism of high-@xmath2  superconductivity ( htsc ) .",
    "the purpose of the present comment  @xcite is to emphasize that the missing link has already been found , and the work by pavarini  can be used as a crucial test for theoretical models of htsc .",
    "perhaps the simplest possible interpretation , though one could search for alternatives , is given within the framework of the present theory . in order for the schubin - zener - kondo exchange amplitude @xmath0  to operate as a pairing interaction of the charge carriers , it is necessary the cu  4s orbital to be significantly hybridized with the conduction band .",
    "the degree of this hybridization depends strongly on the proximity of the cu  4s level to the fermi level @xmath305 .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that @xmath252 controls the maximal critical temperature @xmath306 , being the only parameter of the cuo@xmath110 plane which is essentially changed for different cuprate superconductors .",
    "cu  3d and cu  4s are orthogonal orbitals and their hybridization is indirect .",
    "first , the cu  3d@xmath1 orbital hybridizes with the o  2p@xmath3 and o  2p@xmath4 orbitals , then the o  2p orbitals hybridize with cu  4s . as a result",
    "we have a `` 3d - to-4s - by-2p '' hybridization of the conduction band of htsc cuprates which makes it possible the strong _ antiferromagnetic _ amplitude @xmath0  to create pairing in a relatively narrow cu  3d@xmath1 conduction band .",
    "the hybridization `` filling '' of the cu  4s orbitals can be seen in cluster calculations as well  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath307 parameter introduced in reference  @xcite reflects the proximity of all 3 levels in the generic 4-band hamiltonian of the cuo@xmath110 plane  their `` random coincidence '' for the cu - o combination .",
    "suppose that those levels are not so close to each other .",
    "in this case the slightly modified parameter @xmath308 is simply the energy denominator of the perturbation theory which describes the hybridization filling of the axial orbital , see ( 4.10 ) .",
    "whence @xmath309 ^ 2 $ ] is a denominator of the pairing amplitude in the bcs equation ( 6.4 ) .",

    ". the _ ab initio _ calculation of the kondo scattering amplitude parameterized by @xmath0  is an important problem which has to be set in the agenda of computational solid state physics .",
    "we expect that it will be a weakly material dependent parameter of the order of the s - d exchange amplitude in kondo alloys , but perhaps slightly bigger as for the cu ion the 3d and 4s levels are closer compared to many other ions .",
    "closer energy levels , from classical point of view , imply closer classical periods of orbital motion which leads to some `` resonance '' enhancement of the exchange amplitude due to intra - atomic two - electron correlations .",
    "the final qualitative conclusion that can be extracted from the correlations reported by pavarini  is the explanation why only the cuo@xmath110 plane renders htsc possible , whereas hundreds other similar compounds are not even superconducting , or have only a `` conventional '' value of @xmath2 .",
    "the natural explanation is : because its @xmath313-parameter is not small enough below its critical value .",
    "even among the cuprates one can find compounds with `` conventional '' values of @xmath2  having relatively large value of the @xmath313-parameter . for other transition metal compounds the parameter @xmath314 is much bigger than its critical value @xmath315 which can be reached probably only for the cu - o combination .",
    "thereby , the correlation reported by pavarini  is a crucial hint which of the models for htsc is still on the arena .",

    "<S> these are directly applicable to cuprates without complicating structural accessories ( chains , double @xmath8  planes , etc . ) . </S>",
