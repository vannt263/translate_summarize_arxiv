    "spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) indicates a situation where , given a symmetry of the hamiltonian , there are eigenstates which are not invariant under the action of this symmetry , unless a term is added which explicitly breaks the symmetry . usually , when the control parameter reaches a critical value , the lowest energy eigenstate keeping the hamiltonian symmetry is no longer stable in the presence of infinitely small perturbations , and new stable solutions appear which are not symmetric .",
    "ssb leads naturally to a degenerate manifold of ground states .",
    "symmetry breaking usually occurs in the thermodynamic limit , when superselection destroys quantum coherence .",
    "important exceptions are the xxx heisenberg model and the xy model in a transverse magnetic field at the particular value of the field where ground state factorization occurs @xcite . in these cases ,",
    "ground state degeneracy occurs for any size of the system , and it is therefore possible to explicitly study the transition from quantum to classical behavior . how entanglement is affected , in the thermodynamic limit , by the presence of a term which explicitly breaks the symmetry , ha been discussed by syljusen @xcite and by osterloh _",

    ", we face the problem from another point of view , starting from small systems , and then increasing the size until the thermodynamic limit is reached .    the xy model in a transverse field has been introduced in the early sixties and solved by katsura @xcite , by means of the jordan - wigner transformation , formerly introduced by lieb , schultz , and mattis @xcite .",
    "subsequently , the correlation functions were investigated in great detail by barouch and maccoy @xcite , who found the existence of a second critical value of the transverse field separating qualitatively different behaviors of the correlation functions .",
    "later on , kurmann , thomas and muller @xcite discovered ground state factorization for a large class of spin models . in the particular case of the xy model ,",
    "the field at which factorization occurs is exactly the critical field of barouch and maccoy .",
    "recent interest has been devoted to the study of entanglement properties of many - body systems undergoing a quantum phase transition @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical point turns out to separate two regions with qualitatively different bipartite entanglement .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in the vicinity of the factorizing field , the range of concurrence diverges , and that such divergence corresponds the appearance of a characteristic length scale in the system .",
    "recently , the conditions for the existence of the factorizing field for models with long - range interaction have been determined @xcite , and the study of this effect has been extended to dimerized chains @xcite .",
    "the two systems we wish to investigate belong to different classes of symmetry .",
    "while the xxx heisenberg model has the su(2 ) continuous symmetry , i.e. the hamiltonian commutes with the total spin along any possible direction , the xy model is invariant under parity transformations and possesses the discrete @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "it is commonly accepted that purely quantum effects are not observable on the macroscopic scale , except for superconductivity , superfluidity . on the other hand , quantifying entanglement ( perhaps the most genuine manifestation of quantum properties ) as a function of the system size represents a fundamental issue @xcite . here",
    ", we wish to investigate in detail the two - spin entanglement dependence on the total number of spins for these models .",
    "in particular , we shall derive the difference in the size effects due to the difference in the system symmetry . to be more specific ,",
    "in the case of a discrete symmetry there is an exponential entanglement decrease , while with a continuous symmetry entanglement shrinks linearly with the growth of the system size .    since the xy model has been studied through the last four decades , and results are scattered over a vast literature , for convenience we shall give here a brief survey of the main results , with the primary aim of focusing on the existence of the factorizing field and its independence from the system size .",

    "we give special emphasis to the finite size solution with the scope of enlightening the emergence of the factorizing field as a size - independent degeneracy point .",

    ". an interesting problem would be to check whether this is the microscopic mechanism responsible for the qualitative change in the behavior of the correlation functions above and below @xmath68 .     as a function of the transverse field for a 8-spin chain .",

    "it is simple to show that @xmath73 holds for any @xmath0 , while the positions of all the other level crossing points @xmath63 change with @xmath0 .",

    "according to the superposition principle , every linear combination of quantum states is allowed . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that superposition can not be observed on the macroscopic scale because of superselection , the most convincing argument being the schrdinger cat paradox .",
    "then , on this scale , all but a small set of states belonging the total hilbert space are actually forbidden .",
    "this process , which leads to a diagonal form of the density operator in a preferred basis , implies the vanishing of the most peculiar of quantum properties : state interference .    in order to study the vanishing of state interference we analyze two different quantities : two - spin entanglement and the fluctuation properties of the order parameter @xmath99 . given a density matrix @xmath100 , fluctuations statistics is associated to the generating function @xmath101 which is the fourier transform of the probability distribution function of @xmath102 . when the system can be observed in @xmath103 states @xmath104 ,",

    "similar considerations , carried out about entanglement properties , lead to establish that , when @xmath108 , only factorized states can be observed .",

    "we find different decaying behaviors for the xy and the xxx models , which are caused by the difference in the symmetry of the two systems .",
    "we will start in both models by considering symmetric states ( which are expected not to survive in the thermodynamic limit ) and we shall study two - spin entanglement as a function of @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite , for the xy model at the factorizing field the two - spin concurrence does not depend on the spin distance @xmath112 .",
    "similar arguments can be used also for the xxx chain .",

    "both for the xy and for the isotropic model these quantities vanish exponentially in the large @xmath0 limit , destroying in such a way the quantum interference between different components .",
    "however , since the xxx model has a continuous symmetry , the ground state manifold is continuous as well , and all matrix elements are integrated .",
    "the integration implies a reduction in the decoherence rate , which turns out to be linear in @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we considered two exactly solvable models , and studied how superselection tends to destroy their quantum properties .",
    "a typical tool used to study problems whose solution is not known is the mean - field approximation , that , in fact , consists in the introduction of `` product states '' with the same aspect of those described in this paper .",
    "for example , in the bcs theory of superconductivity the solution introduced is factorized in the space of the modes @xmath40 .",
    "since in the finite - size case the symmetry is expected to be conserved , while the mean - field states are widely unsymmetrical , the linear superposition of degenerate states is a way to restore it .",
    "once the thermodynamic limit is performed , all the considerations made in this paper apply .",
    "then , we can conclude that our results apply not only to the models explicitly studied , but they could used , in the limit of validity of the mean - field theory , in all systems belonging to the classes of symmetry discussed ."
