    "the extension of the hubble diagram to larger distances by using observations from supernovae type ia ( snia ) as standard candles , allowed the history of cosmic expansion to be probed with deeper detail .",
    "independent measurements by various groups indicated that the current expansion is in fact speeding up and not slowing down , as believed for many decades @xcite .",
    "in other words , in virtue of some unknown mechanism , the expansion of the universe underwent a  dynamic phase transition \" whose main effect is to change the sign of the universal deceleration parameter @xmath11 .",
    "the physical explanation for such a transition is one of the greatest challenges for cosmology today . inside the general relativity paradigm ,",
    "it requires the presence of a cosmological constant in the cosmic equations , or to postulate the existence of an exotic fluid with negative pressure ( in addition to dark matter ) , usually called dark energy @xcite , or even a gravitationally - induced cold dark matter creation @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to change the theory describing the gravitational interaction as happens , for instance , in the framework of the so - called f(r ) modified gravity theories @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the space parameter associated with the cosmic expansion is too degenerate , and , as such , it is not possible , based on the current data , to decide which mechanism or dark energy component is operating in the cosmic dynamics @xcite .",
    "another very distinct firsthand approach to access the history of the cosmic expansion without the use of quantities coming from the dynamic description has also been proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "this route is very interesting because it depends neither on the validity of any particular metric theory of gravity nor on the matter - energy content of the observed universe .",
    "it is closely related to the weaker assumption that space - time is homogeneous and isotropic , so that the frw metric is still valid , as are the kinematic equations for redshift / scale factor .",
    "some call it cosmography @xcite or cosmokinetics @xcite , others use the term friedmannless cosmology @xcite , but , in what follows , we refer to it simply as a kinematic approach since it holds true regardless of the underlying cosmic dynamics @xcite .    few years ago , elgary & multamki @xcite investigated constraints on some kinematic models by employing a bayesian marginal likelihood analysis based on the gold supernova sample data of riess et al . @xcite and the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) of astier et al . @xcite . in their analysis of the flat case ,",
    "three different parameterizations for an accelerating @xmath11 model were examined , namely : constant , linear , and abrupt transition , respectively , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 in their nomenclature .",
    "it was also argued that any expansion of the jerk parameter ( the third order contribution in the expansion for kinematic luminosity distance in terms of the redshift z ) could be seen as requiring more parameters , or cosmic fluids in the dynamic approach , than expanding the deceleration parameter .",
    "in addition , it was also observed that the flat @xmath0cdm and the einstein - de sitter model have constant jerk parameter @xmath9 , and , therefore , it can not be used for discriminating such cosmologies .",
    "accordingly , their analysis was restricted to the deceleration parameter .    in this work",
    "we go one step further by examining the case for the jerk parameter ( constant and variable ) .",
    "one basic reason is that the bi - dimensional space parameter ( @xmath15 ) can naturally discriminate the flat @xmath0cdm and einstein - de sitter models because they have different predictions for @xmath1 .",
    "actually , it is not necessary to expand @xmath16 , thereby introducing many parameters in order to have a larger class of models , since this happens even for constant jerk .",
    "probably , and more importantly , it is not clear a priori if the bayesian evidence prefers the cosmic concordance model when a more general constant jerk parameter is considered .",
    "potentially , a constant jerk parameter provide us with the simplest approach to search for departures from the cosmic concordance model . for completeness , in our analysis",
    "we also consider all the flat models discussed by elgary & multamki @xcite , however , we also examine the predictions of two different approaches including constant and variable jerk parameters .",
    "in addition , and differently from previous works , the present bayesian analysis is based on the larger union compilation snia data recently published by kowalski et al . @xcite .",
    "assuming that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic above some scale , the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric provides a good description of the geometry of the universe ( @xmath17 ) ds^2=dt^2-a^2(t ) , where @xmath18 is the space curvature that we will assume hereafter to be null , since the current emerging consensus is that the universe is flat or very close to flat @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath19 is the scale factor , which contains the complete history of the cosmic expansion and can be parameterized by the redshift , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the rate of expansion and the acceleration are represented by the hubble and deceleration parameters , respectively ha , and q-= 12 ( 1+z)-1 . similarly , the jerk parameter is defined as j- = - .",
    "the basic aim here is to examine some simple kinematic models for the cosmic expansion based on specific parameterizations for @xmath11 in ( [ dec ] ) and a constant jerk parameter .    the first and simplest model , @xmath12 , is given by a constant deceleration parameter , @xmath22 .",
    "the second model , @xmath13 , is a linear expansion of the deceleration parameter @xmath23 ( first used by @xcite ) .",
    "model @xmath14 ( introduced by @xcite ) depicts two phases of constant deceleration parameter , separated by an abrupt transition redshift , @xmath22 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "the fourth model , @xmath27 , is a constant jerk parametrization , @xmath28 ( examined for the first time by @xcite ) .",
    "as one may show , the cosmic jerk is related with the deceleration parameter by the differential equation @xmath29 \\ , .",

    "a shortcoming of this series is that for supernovae at @xmath31 the @xmath32 terms may be large in principle , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is a convergence problem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most of the known supernovae are at @xmath33 and a truncation of ( [ dl_exp ] ) always can be seen as a polynomial fit .",

    "there is evidence that the deceleration parameter was higher and positive in the past , implying a transition from a decelerated phase to an accelerated one .",
