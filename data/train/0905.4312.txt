    "given a complex algebraic germ @xmath0 , a choice of generators @xmath1 of its local ring gives an embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath2 .",
    "it then carries two induced metric space structures : the `` outer metric '' induced from distance in @xmath3 and the `` inner metric '' induced by arc - length of curves on @xmath4 . in the lipschitz category",
    "each of these metrics is independent of choice of embedding : different choices give metrics for which the identity map is a bi - lipschitz homeomorphism .",
    "the inner metric , which is given by a riemannian metric off the singular set , is the one that interests us most here .",
    "it is determined by the outer metric , so germs that are distinguished by their inner metrics are distinguished by their outer ones .",
    "these metric structures have so far seen much more study in real algebraic geometry than in the complex algebraic world .",
    "in fact , until fairly recently conventional wisdom was that bi - lipschitz geometry would have little to say for normal germs of complex varieties .",
    "for example , it is easy to see that two complex curve germs with the same number of components are bi - lipschitz homeomorphic ( inner metric ) .",
    "so for curve germs bi - lipschitz geometry is equivalent to topology .",
    "the same holds for outer bi - lipschitz geometry of plane curves : two germs of complex curves in @xmath5 are bi - lipschitz homeomorphic for the outer metric if and only if they are topologically equivalent as embedded germs @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently become apparent that the bi - lipschitz geometry of complex surface germs is quite rich ; for example , they rarely have trivial geometry ( in the sense of being bi - lipschitz homeomorphic to a metric euclidean cone ) .",
    "we give here an explanation which shows that the same holds in higher dimensions too .",
    "the particular bi - lipschitz invariants we will discuss are `` separating sets '' .    let @xmath0 be a germ of a @xmath6-dimensional semialgebraic set .",
    "a _ separating set _ of @xmath0 ( see section [ sec : separating sets ] ) is a subgerm @xmath7 of dimension less than @xmath6 which locally separates @xmath4 into two pieces @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are `` fat '' at @xmath10 while @xmath11 itself is `` thin '' ( i.e. , the @xmath6dimensional densities at @xmath10 of @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nonzero and the @xmath12dimensional density at @xmath10 of @xmath11 is zero )",
    ".    there are trivial ways a separating set can occur  for example as the intersection of the components of a complex germ @xmath0 which is the union of two irreducible components of equal dimension .",
    "the intersection of the two components clearly separates @xmath4 and it is thin because its real codimension is at least @xmath13 . fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] illustrates schematically a codimension 1 example of a separating set .",
    "the interesting question is whether such separating sets exist `` in nature''for isolated singularities in particular .    for real algebraic singularities examples",
    "can be constructed ( see @xcite ) , but they do not seem to arise very naturally .",
    "but for normal complex surface singularities they had turned out to be surprisingly common : already the the simplest singularities , namely the kleinian surfaces singularities @xmath14 , have separating sets at the origin when @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to the investigation of this phenomena in all complex dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "we restrict to isolated complex singularities .",
    "our first result ( theorem [ th : sep ] ) is that _ if @xmath4 is a weighted homogeneous complex surface @xmath17 with weights @xmath18 and if the zero set @xmath19 of the variable @xmath20 of lowest weight has more than one branch at the origin , then @xmath21 has a separating set .",
    "_ this reproves that @xmath22 has a separating set at the origin when @xmath15 , and shows more generally that the same holds for the brieskorn singularity @xmath23 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "it also proves that for @xmath26 the singularity @xmath27 from the brianon - speder family @xcite @xmath28 has a separating set at the origin . on the other hand ,",
    "we show ( theorem [ bs_1 ] ) that @xmath27 does not have a separating set when @xmath29 .",
    "thus _ the inner bi - lipschitz type of a normal surface germ is not determined by topological type , even in a family of singularities of constant topological type _ ( and is thus also not determined by the resolution graph )",
    ".    we also show ( see theorem [ th : septc ] ) that _ if the tangent cone @xmath30 of an isolated complex singularity @xmath0 has a non - isolated singularity and the non - isolated locus is a separating set of @xmath30 , then @xmath0 has a separating set . _    it follows , for instance ( see @xcite ) , that all quotient surface singularities @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 acting freelly on @xmath33 ) have separating sets except the ones that are obviously conical ( @xmath34 with the group @xmath35 of @xmath36th roots of unity acting by multiplication ) and possibly , among the simple singularities , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the @xmath40 series . moreover , for any @xmath6 one can find cyclic quotient singularities with more than @xmath6 disjoint non - equivalent separating sets .",
    "theorem [ th : septc ] also easily gives examples of separating sets for isolated singularities in higher dimension .",
    "it is natural to ask if the converse to [ th : septc ] holds , i.e. , separating sets in @xmath0 always correspond to separating sets in @xmath30 , but this is not so : the tangent cone of the brianon - speder singularity @xmath27 , which has a separating set for @xmath26 , is @xmath5 . but",
    "in theorem [ th : nsc ] we give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a separating set in terms of the `` metric tangent cone '' @xmath41 , the theory of which was recently developed by bernig and lytchak @xcite .",
    "@xmath41 is defined as the gromov - hausdorff limit as @xmath42 of the result of scaling the inner metric of the germ @xmath0 by @xmath43 .",
    "another way of constructing @xmath41 , and the one we actually use , is as usual tangent cone of a",
