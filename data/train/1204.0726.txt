    "solar active regions ( ars ) including sunspots are generally thought to be the consequence of flux emergence , that is , the buoyant rise of the magnetic flux from the deep convection zone @xcite .",
    "observationally , the new emerging flux appears as a small and bright bipolar plage in the chromospheric h and k line cores @xcite .",
    "soon afterwards , the arch filament system ( afs ) composed of parallel dark fibrils appears in the line core of h@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the fibrils are magnetic field lines connecting the faculae of positive and negative polarities . in the photosphere ,",
    "small pores are formed at the root of chromospheric filaments with downflows up to @xmath3 .",
    "the faculae of opposite polarity separates , initially at the rate of @xmath4 , and the rate drops to @xmath5@xmath6 during the next 6 hours @xcite . new magnetic flux emerges continuously within the opposite polarities . if the flux is sufficient ,",
    "the pores are gathered , and gradually sunspots are formed near the leading and the following plages @xcite .    in the last several decades ,",
    "numerical computations have been well developed to reveal the dynamics of the flux emergence and the birth of the active region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". in our recent simulations on the large - scale flux emergence from a depth of @xmath7 , the rising twisted flux tube in the convection zone decelerates and makes a flat structure just beneath the photosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this calculation , the plasma , which is pushed up by the rising flux , escapes laterally around the surface .",
    "the appearance of the divergent outflow at the photosphere was found to be earlier than that of magnetic flux , and , at this moment , the outflow is mainly horizontal .",
    "hereafter we call this preceding outflow as a horizontal divergent flow ( hdf ) .",
    "a similar flow is also reported by @xcite . however , to our knowledge , the hdf prior to the flux emergence has not been confirmed clearly in previous observations @xcite .",
    "here , we use the term `` horizontal '' to indicate the direction parallel to the solar surface .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate the hdf and the evolving magnetic field at an early phase of the flux emergence .",
    "for this purpose , we used the dopplergrams and magnetograms of the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ) on board the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , since their continuous observations of the whole solar disk make it possible to achieve information at the very moment of , or even before the flux emergence at the surface .",
    "our numerical result indicates that , if the newly emerging region is located away from the disk center , if a pair of positive and negative doppler patterns is detected just before the flux emergence , and if the positive ( negative ) pattern is limbward ( disk - centerward ) , the observed doppler velocity is mainly horizontal rather than vertical .",
    "therefore , we can evaluate the horizontal velocity of the escaping plasma from the doppler velocity , by considering the heliocentric angle of the active region from the disk center .",
    "one advantage of this method over the ordinal local correlation - tracking method @xcite is that the horizontal velocity of the plasma can be evaluated independently of the apparent motion of magnetic elements at the photosphere .",
    "after the flux has emerged , we can not obtain the horizontal speed from the doppler velocity , since it may contain a vertical motion such as rising of magnetic fields or a downflow in the convective collapse process .    in this paper , we report the first determination of the hdf prior to the flux appearance , using sdo / hmi dopplergrams and magnetograms",
    ". we also studied the chromospheric reaction to the flux emergence in the photosphere by using h@xmath1 images taken by the solar magnetic activity research telescope ( smart ) at hida observatory . in section",

    "in section [ sec : discussion ] , we will discuss the observational results .",
    "finally , we will summarize the paper in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "in this paper , we studied noaa ar 11081 formed in 2010 june , in the northwest of the solar disk . to measure the doppler shift and line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field in the photosphere , we used dopplergrams and magnetograms taken by sdo / hmi .",
    "also , to study the chromospheric response to the flux emergence , we used h@xmath1 images taken by smart at hida observatory .",
    "sdo / hmi continuously observes the whole solar disk at the 6173  line , which is resolved by @xmath8 pixels @xcite . to obtain the tracked data cubes of the birth of ar 11081",
    ", we used mtrack module .",
    "the data cubes of the doppler velocity and the los magnetogram have a spatial resolution of @xmath9 ( 1 pixel corresponds to @xmath10 ) with @xmath11 pixel field - of - view ( fov ) , and a temporal resolution of @xmath12 with a duration of @xmath13 , starting at 12:00 ut on 2010 june 10 . in the initial state ,",
    "the center of the @xmath11 fov is located at n@xmath14 w@xmath15 , or ( @xmath16 ) arcsecs in solar disk coordinates . here , we applied postel s projection , that is , both doppler and magnetic maps are projected as if seen from directly above .",
    "then , to eliminate the effects of the rotation of the sun and the orbital motion of the satellite , and to determine the zero point of the los velocity , we reduced the mean velocity from each dopplergram .",
    "also , a 30-min ( 40-frame ) moving average was applied to the dopplergrams and magnetograms .",

    "they are placed on a tower with a height of @xmath17 .",
    "t1 obtains h@xmath1 full solar disk images at high temporal and spatial resolution . for studying the chromospheric reaction to the photospheric flux emergence",
    ", we analyzed the h@xmath1 data of 01:0005:00 ut , 2010 june 11 , which resolves the full solar disk with @xmath8 pixels ( 1 pixel corresponds to @xmath18 ) and has a maximum temporal resolution of 2 minutes .    in this study , we only used h@xmath1 line core images ( wavelength at @xmath19 ) .",
    "first , dark - current subtraction and flat fielding were performed on the obtained smart data .",
    "then , by taking a cross - correlation of the two consecutive images to fix the position of the target emerging active region , we made a data cube of h@xmath1 images .",

    "figure [ fig : evolution ] shows the temporal evolution of the dopplergram and the magnetogram for 12 hours from 18:00 ut , 2010 june 10 . in the dopplergram ,",
    "the motion toward and away from the observer are shown in blue and red , respectively . at first , during 18:0000:00 ut , the surface is relatively quiet with some preceding magnetic elements of both positive and negative polarities . an area with strong blue shift ( @xmath20 ) appears in the middle of the fov at 01:00 ut on 11 june , which is gradually growing in size .",
    "after 3:00 ut , the strong red shift ( @xmath21 ) appears and magnetic field emergence takes place .",
    "both positive and negative polarities move apart from each other . here",
    ", the separation of the magnetic elements is almost along the slit , which is indicated as a diagonal line .",
    "finally , at 06:00 ut , the red and blue areas become faint . the separated magnetic elements",
    "stop and gather to form pores at the boundary of the emerging region .    in this section ,",
    "we first introduce the results of time - slices of the dopplergrams and magnetograms in section [ sec : slice ] .",
    "then , in section [ sec : histogram ] , we will clarify the occurrence times of the hdf and the flux emergence , and evaluate the horizontal speed of the hdf .",
    "section [ sec : chromosphere ] is dedicated to showing the chromospheric studies .      to examine the motion of the magnetic elements of positive and negative polarities and the corresponding los velocity , we made time - sliced diagrams of hmi dopplergrams and magnetograms .",
    "the spatial slit is indicated as a diagonal line in figure [ fig : fov ] and figure [ fig : evolution ] , which is placed parallel to the separation of both polarities .",
    "figure [ fig : slice ] is the time - sliced diagram of the dopplergram and the magnetogram along the slit . from the time - slice of the magnetogram ,",
    "figure [ fig : slice](b ) , we can see that both positive and negative polarities move apart from each other from around 03:00 ut on june 11 .",
    "the speed of each element is estimated to be @xmath22 , which then drops to @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the separation speed is @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "this deceleration of the separated polarities may reflect that the polarities are reaching the boundary of the active region .",
    "these elements then gathered to create stronger pores , of which the absolute los field intensity is greater than @xmath26 .",
    "one would find that weak and small elements of both polarities appear between the main separating pores during 03:0009:00 ut on june 11 . also , the main positive pore collides with the preexisting negative polarity , and they cancel each other out .",
    "in the doppler slice , figure [ fig : slice](a ) , a pair of red and blue patterns emerged at around 02:00 ut , june 11 , slightly earlier than the appearance of the magnetic elements in figure [ fig : slice](b ) .",
    "the red and blue shift patterns immediately started to separate , and the propagation speed of the patterns ( the slope of the patterns ) is about @xmath27 . here",
    ", we note that the blue ( red ) pattern is located disk - centerward ( limbward ) , which indicates that the flow is divergent .",
    "moreover , from the fact that the divergent outflow came before the flux emergence , we can assume that the outflow during this period is caused by the plasma escaping from the rising magnetic flux .",
    "it should be noted that the trend of the doppler pattern coming before the flux emergence does not change when we vary the thickness of the slit .    however , the determination of the appearance time of the doppler pattern associated with the flux emergence is difficult , because the doppler pattern , especially the blue shift , appeared at the location where the supergranulation showed blue shift ( 21:0001:00 ut ) .",
    "the definition of the flux emergence and the appearance of the related doppler pattern is dealt with in the next subsection (  [ sec : histogram ] ) .",
    "it is not easy to determine the timings of the appearance of the hdf and the associated flux emergence from figures [ fig : evolution ] and [ fig : slice ] .",
    "in particular , we have to distinguish the outflow related to the flux emergence from the preexisting convective motions of the quiet sun ( e.g. , granulations and supergranulations ) . to clarify with significance",
    "when the hdf occurred and when the magnetic flux emerged , we studied the temporal changes of the doppler and magnetic patterns from those before the emergence , namely , patterns of the quiet sun . also , in this subsection , we describe how we evaluate the horizontal speed of the hdf .    first , we plotted the histograms of the doppler velocity and the absolute los field strength inside the square of figure [ fig : fov ] for each frame .",
    "the size of the square is @xmath28 pixels @xmath29 , which is selected to include the emergence region . as for the dopplergram ,",
    "the apex of the histogram was shifted to fit the zero point .",
    "then , considering the photospheric condition in the 3 hours from 21:00 ut of june 10 to be sufficiently quiet , we averaged up each 240 histograms of the dopplergrams and the magnetograms in this period , and regarded these averages as reference quiet - sun profiles .    in the left column of figure [ fig : histogram ] , we show histograms of the doppler velocity at five different times of june 11 , plotted over the reference quiet - sun profile . here",
    "we note that the quiet - sun profile obtained is similar to a gaussian distribution .",
    "the shade indicates the standard deviation above and below the reference .",
    "as time goes by , the profile becomes deviated from the reference , because the number of pixels of which the absolute doppler velocity is greater than @xmath30 increases .",
    "the right column of figure [ fig : histogram ] is the residual of the doppler histogram from the reference .",
    "one standard deviation is also shown as a shaded area .",
    "at first , the residual is below one standard deviation level for most of the velocity range . from 02:00 ut , however , the residual exceeds the deviation .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram_mag ] is the same as figure [ fig : histogram ] , but for the absolute field strength of the los magnetograms . here",
    ", the quiet - sun profile consists of a distribution with a width of @xmath31 ( about the precision of the hmi magnetogram ) and some preexisting pores within the fov .",
    "thus , the profile is different from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the residual in the range of @xmath32 further exceeds one standard deviation level from 04:00 ut . after this time",
    ", the residual of @xmath32 becomes well over the standard deviation , because more and more flux is emerged and stronger pores are created .    for the significance of the measurement",
    ", we define the start time of the hdf and the flux emergence as the time when each residual of the dopplergrams and the magnetograms exceeded one standard deviation level .",
    "to know these times , we show in figure [ fig : timing ] each time - evolution of the residuals ( taken from and averaged over the range @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] for dopplergram , and the range @xmath35 $ ] for magnetogram ) , plotted over one standard deviation . in this figure ,",
    "the residual of the dopplergram becomes over the standard deviation at 01:23 ut on 11 june , while that of the magnetogram exceeds the level at 03:06 ut .",
    "that is , the appearance of the hdf came before the flux emergence by about 100 minutes .    during this period",
    ", it is expected that the flow is mainly horizontal and a vertical component is less dominant .",
    "thus , we can calculate the horizontal velocity from the residual distribution of the doppler velocity ( figure [ fig : histogram ] ) , by considering the geometric effect .",
    "the relation between the horizontal velocity @xmath36 and the doppler velocity @xmath37 is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the heliocentric angle of the emerging region measured from the disk center . from 01:23 to 03:06",
    "ut , the doppler velocity range where the residual exceeds the one standard deviation is typically 0.4@xmath40 , which is up to @xmath41 , and the heliocentric angle is @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , the horizontal velocity is calculated to be @xmath43@xmath41 , and the maximum is @xmath44 .    here , we comment on the selection of the field - strength range ( @xmath35 $ ] ) and its dependence on the start time of the flux emergence .",
    "if we use the lower strength range , for example @xmath45 $ ] or @xmath46 $ ] , at which the residual exceeds one standard deviation level faster ( figure [ fig : histogram_mag ] , right column ) , the start time of the flux emergence is calculated to be much earlier . in the present analysis , however , the strength range @xmath35 $ ] is used , since the number of the pixels of @xmath47 is so small in the quiet sun that the flux emergence is easily detected when it occurs .",
    "we confirmed this fact by applying the same analysis on the quiet - sun data .",
    "as for the dependence of the strength range on the observation results , we tested the analysis with various ranges , which is summarized in table [ tab : range ] . from this table",
    "one can see that the start time does not so change for [ @xmath48 , [ @xmath49 , and [ @xmath50 cases .",
    "we also checked the dependence of the size of the square where the histograms are made ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fov ] ) , which is summarized in table [ tab : size ] . here , the time difference is almost constant for various square sizes and is about 100 min . with increasing square size , the ratio of high - speed or strong pixels in the square reduces .",
    "at the same time , the quiet - sun reference profile becomes more accurate and one standard deviation level decreases .",
    "therefore , in total , the time difference remains constant .      in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the time - evolution of the h@xmath1 intensity to examine the relation between the chromosphere and the photosphere in this studied event .",
    "figure [ fig : ha](a ) is a sample image of the smart h@xmath1 data .",
    "the color and contours indicate the relative h@xmath1 intensity . in this figure , there are two bright regions ( plages ) in the middle of the fov .",
    "then , along the slit of figure [ fig : ha](a ) , we made a time - sliced diagram for 4 hours starting at 01:00 ut , 11 june , which is shown as figure [ fig : ha](b ) .",
    "note that the slit in figure [ fig : ha](a ) is not exactly the same as that in figure [ fig : fov ] , since the h@xmath1 data is a simple closeup view of the full disk image , while postel s projection is applied to the hmi data .",
    "thus , from this study , we can only determine the appearance time of the chromospheric brightening .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ha](b ) , the first bright source at the slit location of @xmath51 starts at 02:40 ut .",
    "however , it was found that this brightening is due to the activity among the preexisting quiet - sun pores of both polarities , which later collide with positive patches of the newly emerging flux ( see section [ sec : slice ] ) .",
    "it is difficult to separate this bright source into activity of the preexisting pores and that of the newly emerged positive pores .",
    "the second source located at @xmath52 starts at 03:20 ut , and there was no preceding pore in this region .",
    "therefore , we consider that the second source is entirely due to the newly emerged negative pores , and determine that the chromospheric reaction starts at this time ( 03:20 ut ; indicated by a dashed line in figure [ fig : ha](b ) ) .",
    "the two chromospheric sources are located just over the positive and negative polarities in the photosphere .",
    "in this paper we analyze the newly emerging active region and find that there is a time difference between the appearance of the horizontal divergent flow ( hdf ) and the corresponding flux emergence ; the hdf appears prior to the flux emergence by about 100 minutes .    according to the thin - flux - tube simulation @xcite",
    ", the rising speed of the flux tube accelerates from the top few tens of mm of the convection zone .",
    "however , at the same time , the flux tube expands as the external density ( pressure ) decreases with height .",
    "the radius of the tube eventually exceeds the local pressure scale height at a depth of @xmath53 and the thin - flux - tube approximation breaks out .",
    "recently , our numerical simulations using the fully compressed mhd , including the convection zone , the photosphere , and the corona in a single computational box , have revealed that the rising flux tube decelerates in the uppermost convection zone @xcite .",
    "it is because the plasma on the flux tube piles up between the apex of the tube and the subadiabatically stratified photosphere ahead , and the plasma inhibits the rising motion of the flux tube .",
    "then , the accumulated plasma in turn extends the tube laterally .",
    "this accumulation becomes effective from the depth where the apex of the tube becomes `` flat '' .",
    "this critical depth is also considered as being where the tube s radius exceeds the local pressure scale height ( depth @xmath54 ) .",
    "the lateral expansion of the flux tube appears similar to those found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , their expansions occur because the tubes themselves move into the subadiabatic photosphere .    as the rising tube approaches the photosphere , the accumulated plasma on the rising tube escapes horizontally around the surface and",
    "is observed as an hdf , while the tube stops beneath the surface .",
    "since the flux is continuously transported from below , the magnetic pressure gradient at the photosphere enhances and the further emergence to the upper atmosphere starts due to the magnetic buoyancy instability .",
    "when the flux resumes rising , it can be observed as a `` flux emergence '' at the photospheric level .",
    "therefore , the time difference detected in this paper implies the period of latency during which the flux tube reaching the photosphere develops the magnetic buoyancy instability .",
    "the growth time of the instability is , however , complicated and may be related to many parameters of the rising flux tube such as field strength , total flux , twist , etc .",
    "thus , we shall leave the estimation of the time gap for our future numerical research .      to describe the relation between the hdf and the contributing upflow below the surface",
    ", we make a simple model , which is schematically illustrated as figure [ fig : model ] .",
    "when the magnetic flux tube has emerged from the deeper convection zone , an upflow region is formed in front of the flux tube .",
    "if the typical size of this region is @xmath55 and the velocity is @xmath56 , the mass flux passing through the area of @xmath57 can be described as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the plasma density .",
    "next , the photospheric plasma that escapes from the upflow propagates the surface as an hdf .",
    "if we write the horizontal velocity at the radial distance @xmath60 as @xmath61 , the thickness as @xmath62 , and the density as @xmath63 , the mass flux passing through @xmath64 is @xmath65 these fluxes , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , are assumed to be conserved .",
    "therefore , from equations ( [ eq : f1 ] ) and ( [ eq : f2 ] ) , the upflow velocity is @xmath68    as a result of the observational study , the horizontal speed is @xmath69 at @xmath70 . here",
    "we assume that ( a ) plasma density is almost uniform around the photosphere , i.e. , @xmath71 , ( b ) the thickness is about the local pressure scale height , @xmath72 , and ( c ) the size of the upflow is @xmath73 ( the smallest distance between the blue and red patterns in figure [ fig : slice ] ) ; @xmath74 .",
    "under these assumptions , equation ( [ eq : vup1 ] ) reduces to @xmath75 .",
    "the time gap between the hdf appearance and the flux emergence was observed to be @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , the depth that the apex of the magnetic flux transited across after it decelerated , is estimated to be @xmath77 , if the flux tube rises at the same rate as the upflow .    in this section , for simplicity , we assumed that the apex of the rising flux is circular , and that the outflow velocity @xmath36 is only a function of @xmath60 . from figure",
    "[ fig : evolution ] , however , it seems that the hdf is not axisymmetric and is stronger in the direction of flux emergence ( the northwest - southeast slit in this figure ) .",
    "this property is consistent with our preceding numerical results ; the photospheric plasma flow is found to be along the direction of flux emergence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , in that simulation , the twist of the rising flux tube is stronger and the magnetic field at the tube s surface is almost perpendicular to the axis of the tube . in the later phase of the target ar of this paper , the separation of positive and negative polarities shifted into the northeast - southwest direction , i.e. , perpendicular to the diagonal line in figure [ fig : evolution ] . taking into account the previous numerical results , and considering that the observed ne - sw direction indicates the axis of the flux tube that forms this ar",
    ", we can think that the twist of this flux tube is tight , and therefore the flow is in the nw - se direction .      using soho / mdi , @xcite observed noaa ar 10488 and found that upflows of matter with a high velocity ( @xmath78 ) preceded flux emergences by 8 and 13 min .",
    "thus , the last @xmath79 min of the divergent doppler pattern observed in our study that remained for 100 min , may contain the upward motion .",
    "however , for most of the period , the flow is expected to remain horizontal .",
    "note that the upflow velocity of @xmath78 reported by @xcite may be the speed of a magnetic flux rising in the photosphere .",
    "as for the estimated velocity ( @xmath75 ) in section [ sec : model ] , this value indicates the emergence speed of a magnetic flux in the uppermost convection zone .    by means of time - distance helioseismology , @xcite detected strong acoustic travel - time anomalies as deep as 65 mm , 1 to 2 days before the flux rate reaches its peak , and ( in most cases ) a few hours before the start of the flux appearance at the surface ( see also * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these anomalies are considered as signs of the rising magnetic flux .",
    "taking account of our numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is consistent to interpret this helioseismic anomaly as a result of the effect similar to the plasma accumulation ; external media may be perturbed or compressed by the rising motion of the magnetic flux .",
    "the importance of the helioseismic anomaly in @xcite and the hdf in our study is that these phenomena occur prior to the flux emergence at the photosphere .",
    "that is , these are the precursors of the flux emergence . by combining two types of observations , sunspot appearances",
    "may be predicted in the near future .      in section [ sec :",
    "chromosphere ] , we found that the h@xmath1 brightenings ( plages ) were located over the positive and negative pores in the photosphere .",
    "this indicates that the brightenings are caused by the plasma flowing down along magnetic loops that connect the photospheric magnetic elements ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 10 ) .",
    "the appearance of the chromospheric source was at 03:20 ut on june 11 , while the flux emergence was at 03:06 ut .",
    "if we assume the h@xmath1 formation height as @xmath80 , the rise velocity of the magnetic field is @xmath81 .",
    "this value is smaller than the observed speed of the chromospheric arch filament system ( afs ) of @xmath82 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which implies that the actual rise speed is faster than @xmath83 and it takes some time to create h@xmath1 plage after the flux reaches the chromospheric height .",
    "in this paper , we have observed the horizontal divergent flow ( hdf ) prior to the flux emergence by using sdo / hmi dopplergram and magnetogram .",
    "the presence of the hdf was predicted by our preceding numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the hmi s continuous observation of the whole solar disk provides the means to analyze the earlier stage of the flux emergence .",
    "the summary of the observation is given as table [ tab : summary ] .",
    "first , we made time - slices of dopplergram and los magnetogram of noaa ar 11081 . from the magnetic slice",
    ", we found that the magnetic elements of positive and negative polarities separated from each other .",
    "the apparent speed of a single element was , at first , @xmath84 .",
    "the speed then dropped to @xmath27 and the elements gathered to create stronger pores of @xmath47 . in the doppler slice ,",
    "a pair of blue and red pattern was observed to separate , slightly earlier than the flux emergence , and the blue ( red ) pattern was located disk - centerward ( limbward ) .",
    "this indicates that the hdf appeared prior to the flux emergence . according to our previous numerical experiments",
    ", the outflow is mainly horizontal during the period from the appearance of the outflow to the emergence of the magnetic flux .",
    "secondly , we evaluated the times of the hdf appearance and the flux emergence . to determine these times with significance",
    ", we studied the temporal changes of the doppler and magnetic patterns from those of the quiet sun , and defined them as the times when each profile exceeded one standard deviation of its quiet - sun profile . as a result",
    ", the doppler profile was found to deviate from the quiet - sun profile at 01:23 ut , 2010 june 11 , while the magnetic profile deviated at 03:06 ut .",
    "therefore , the time difference was about 100 minutes . also , by considering the heliocentric angle , the horizontal speed of the hdf in this time gap was estimated to be @xmath43@xmath41 , up to @xmath44 .",
    "the creation of the hdf is due to the density accumulated on the apex of the flux tube during its ascent in the convection zone .",
    "this accumulation occurs between the flattened apex of the rising flux tube and the subadiabatically stratified photosphere .",
    "the compressed plasma escapes horizontally around the photosphere , which was observed in this paper .",
    "after the magnetic flux is sufficiently intensified , the magnetic buoyancy instability is triggered and the magnetic field restarts into the upper atmosphere , which was also seen as a flux emergence in this paper .",
    "therefore , the time difference of @xmath85 min may reflect the latency during which the flux is waiting for the instability onset .    applying a simple model of the horizontal flow and the corresponding upflow beneath the surface",
    ", we speculated that the depth of the magnetic flux is about @xmath86 .",
    "previously , soho / mdi found that an upflow preceded the flux emergence by about 10 minutes @xcite .",
    "this implies that the last @xmath79 min of the divergent outflow may include the upward motion .",
    "even so , for most of the period , the outflow remains horizontal .",
    "moreover , using h@xmath1 images taken by smart , we studied chromospheric response to the flux emergence at the photosphere .",
