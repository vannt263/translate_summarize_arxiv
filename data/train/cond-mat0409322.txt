    "the properties of quasi one - dimensional conductors are of particular interest from a theoretical point of view , because in one dimension electron - electron interactions lead to a break - down of the fermi - liquid picture established half a century ago by lev landau @xcite .",
    "a description by a tomonaga - luttinger liquid @xcite seems to be more appropriate implying a number of very distinct features like spin - charge separation and power - laws in certain quantities @xcite . while the theory of one - dimensional electronic systems was put forward by numerous contributions @xcite during the last decades , the experimental realization is only tackled since a few years .",
    "attempts in the field of semiconductor quantum wires , edge states and stripe phases in the quantum hall effect , carbon nanotubes , and rows of metal atoms on vicinal surfaces have been successful to some degree .",
    "in particular the quasi one - dimensional organic conductors of the bechgaard family @xcite serve as model systems to test the theoretical predictions .",
    "these compounds are charge transfer salts consisting of stacks of the planar organic molecules tmtsf ( which stands for tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene ) along the @xmath0-axis which are separated in @xmath12-direction by monovalent anions like pf@xmath13 , asf@xmath13 , reo@xmath14 , or clo@xmath14 . in @xmath15-direction",
    "the distance of the stacks is comparable to the van der waals radii .",
    "most prominent findings are the reduced density of states at the fermi energy as indicated by photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , the @xmath12-axis transport investigated by pressure dependent dc resistivity @xcite , the scaling behavior in the optical conductivity @xcite , the hall effect @xcite , and finally indications of spin - charge separation by the similarity in the spin dynamics @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite for tmtsf and tmttf salts although the electronic transport is very much different ; for a review see ref .",
    "[ ] .    real materials always have a finite coupling between the chains , no matter how anisotropic they are .",
    "the question arises whether the luttinger liquid effects can be observed in quasi one - dimensional systems .",
    "the general expectation is that these compounds cross over from luttinger liquid behavior to a coherent behavior as the temperature or frequency is lowered @xcite ; the details , however , are still under debate . for a quasi one - dimensional system with coupling @xmath16 ,",
    "the effective dimensionality depends on the energy range of interest : at low temperatures ( @xmath17 ) the system is three - dimensional and only at elevated temperatures ( @xmath18 ) or high frequencies ( @xmath19 ) , one - dimensional properties are expected . in the case of the bechgaard salts , for instance , the transfer integrals are approximately @xmath20 , so the bare crossover integral should be of the order of 200  k. although it was initially believed @xcite based on nmr data that this scale would be renormalized by interactions down to 20  k , the more recent optical and transport measurements place @xcite this scale at about 100  k.    only very recently attempts were undertaken to describe a system of weakly coupled luttinger chains and actually focus on the interchain transport @xcite . from an experimental point of view , measurements of quasi one - dimensional organic samples in the direction perpendicular to the needle axis are extremely challenging and only very few results on tmtsf salts have been published @xcite . here",
    "we report on temperature dependent dc and contactless microwave measurements of the electrical conductivity in all three directions of 6  and 4 .",
    "single crystals of the bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath21 are grown by electrochemical methods in an h - type glass cell between room temperature and @xmath22c . a constant voltage of 1.5  v was applied between platnium electrodes with an area of approximately 3  @xmath23 .",
    "the current through the solution was between 9.2 and 13.4@xmath24a . to reduce the diffusion ,",
    "a sand barrier can be introduced .",
    "after several months we were able to harvest needle - shaped to flake - like single crystals of several millimeters in length and a considerable width ( @xmath1-direction ) up to 2  mm .",
    "due the triclinic symmetry , @xmath1 denotes the projection of the @xmath15 axis perpendicular to @xmath0 , and @xmath2 is normal to the @xmath25 plane .",
    "the dc resistivity of 6  along the @xmath0-axis was measured on needle - shaped samples with a typical dimension of @xmath26 along the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 axes , respectively .",
    "the results on the @xmath1-axis conductivity were obtained on a narrow slice cut from a thick crystal perpendicular to the needle axis ; the typical dimensions of so - made samples were @xmath27 .",
    "single crystals of 4  have about the same size in @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions ( they grow even wider since they are more two - dimensional ) , however , the thickness ( @xmath2 axis ) rarely exceeds 50 or 60  @xmath28 m . due to our advances in achieving large sample geometry , we were able to measure @xmath1-axis resistivity for the first time with basically no influence of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 contributions and using standard four - probe technique to eliminate the contact resistances . also for the @xmath2-axis transport",
    ", we were able to apply four contacts , two on each side of the crystal .",
    "the contacts were made by evaporating gold pads on the crystal , then 25  @xmath28 m gold wires were pasted on each pad with a small amount of silver or carbon paint .",
    "the 6  samples were slowly cooled down to avoid cracks and ensure a thermal equilibrium . in the case of 4",
    "we conducted experiments in the relaxed state using a slow cooling rate of less than 0.2  k / min . employing a @xmath29he cryostat ,",
    "we cooled down below the superconducting transition at @xmath30  k. in order to reach the quenched state , the crystal were cooled down rapidly from about 50  k with a rate of more than 50  k / min and the data were subsequently recorded on warming up .    besides dc experiments we investigated the anisotropic transport of 6  and 4  single crystals in all three directions at microwave frequencies .",
    "the major advantage of this method is that no contacts have to be applied .",
    "they always lead to a current injection which is not well defined ; it can not be avoided that the contact pads required for dc experiments influence the current flow .",
    "it is not always clear which part of the bulk material actually carries the current and which part is probed for the voltage drop .",
    "also surface currents may have a large influence in highly anisotropic conductors . in microwave experiments the dielectric response of the entire sample is integrated ; admittedly other factors , like the geometry , the depolarization factor or skin effect cause uncertainties .",
    "for measuring the microwave conductivity in @xmath0-direction we employed naturally grown needles of typical dimensions of @xmath31 , in the case of 6-crystals , for instance .",
    "since a needle - like geometry is best also for precise microwave measurements , we again cut a slice ( @xmath32 ) from a thick single crystal to measure in @xmath1 direction . in order to perform microwave experiments along the @xmath2 axis , we carefully cut a crystal into several pieces ( approximately cubes of 0.2  mm corner size ) and arranged up to four as a mosaic in such a way that a needle - shaped sample of about @xmath33 was obtained @xcite . in the case of 4",
    "we had to assemble eleven thin pieces on top of each other to obtain a mosaic of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the microwave experiments utilize three different cylindrical copper cavities which resonate in the te@xmath35 mode at 24 , 33.5 , and 60  ghz .",
    "they are fed by voltage - driven gunn oscillators via suitable waveguides and operate in the transmission mode .",
    "the coupling is about 10%  and done via two holes in the sidewalls .",
    "the crystals are positioned in the maximum of the electric field placed onto a quartz substrate ( 0.07  mm thick ) and can be rotated in situ around one axis .",
    "the samples were cooled down slowly ( 0.2  k per minute , to avoid microcracks ) from 300  k to 2  k by coupling to the liquid helium bath with the help of low - pressure he exchange gas and by utilizing a regulated heater .",
    "temperatures as low as 0.7  k could be achieved with a special cavity attached to a @xmath29he chamber @xcite .",
    "the stability is better than 10  mk @xcite . by recording the center frequency @xmath36 and the halfwidth @xmath37 of the resonance curve as a function of temperature and comparing them to the corresponding parameters of an empty cavity ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , the complex electrodynamic properties of the sample , like the surface impedance",
    ", the conductivity and the dielectric constant , can be determined via cavity perturbation theory ; further details on microwave measurements and the data analysis are summarized in @xcite .",
    "the microwave experiments on 4  using a fast cooling rate of approximately 12  k / min ( in order to prevent the tetrahedral anions to order ) could not fully achieve the quenched state , but in some runs we still see slight bumps in the resistivity at the ordering temperature of @xmath40  k. thus we concentrate here on the relaxed state obtained by cooling with less than 0.2 k per minute ; in this case the spin - density - wave state does not show up below @xmath41  k @xcite . since for 60 ghz no complete set of data is available and no unexpected fact are found by now , we will disregard these experiments and focus on 24 and 33.5  ghz .",

    ", the transport properties of coupled one - dimensional chains have been investigated @xcite . due to the interactions the effective interchain hopping is renormalized @xcite , leading to a smaller crossover scale than that for free electrons . a simple expression for this crossover scale is @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the single - particle exponent . for commensurate chains",
    "a more complex analysis is needed to determine @xmath134 ( see e.g.ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "the conductivity parallel @xcite to the chains @xmath135 and the conductivity perpendicular @xcite to the chains @xmath136 were calculated in a system of weakly coupled luttinger chains .",
    "it was found that the interchain hopping is responsible for the metallic character of the ( tmtsf)@xmath21 compounds , which would be otherwise mott insulators .",
    "the temperature - dependent transport yields a power - law for the longitudinal and transverse resistivity , respectively : @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the coupling constant for the umklapp - scattering process with @xmath140 filling , @xmath141 is the luttinger - liquid exponent controlling the decay of all correlation functions ( @xmath142 corresponds to non - interacting electrons and @xmath143 is the condition upon which the 1/4 filled umklapp process becomes relevant ) , and @xmath144 is the fermi - surface exponent . for the frequency - dependent transport",
    "the conductivity parallel and perpendicular to the chains is given by power - laws : @xmath145 @xmath146 optical experiments on 6  and 4  along the chains @xcite yield @xmath147 in both cases .",
    "we now want to see whether we can describe the temperature dependent longitudinal and transverse transport in both compounds consistently . in that respect 6  and 4",
    "have to be distinguished .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ] 6 ~    indeed 6 shows a quite consistent behavior with the above theoretical description , with a crossover scale of about @xmath148  k. although 6  is highly anisotropic as far as the absolute values of the resistivity are concerned , the temperature dependence below @xmath149  k is the same for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions implying a similar transport mechanism . in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] the ratios of @xmath60 are plotted as a function of temperature . above 50  k",
    "the ratio for 6  is basically constant and corresponds to the bandstructure anisotropy ( this does not hold for the @xmath2-direction as we will discuss below ) . using 4@xmath150  ev together with measured resistivity gives ( @xmath151  mev , which is quite close to the anisotropy ( @xmath152  mev as determined by p.  m.  grant by band structure calculations  @xcite .",
    "the increase of @xmath60 below 50  k is mainly caused by the transverse resistivity in @xmath1 direction which levels off as the spin - density - wave transition at 12  k is approached .",
    "it is not clear at this point , however , whether fluctuations are solely responsible for this behavior since they are expected to dominate along the chains . @xmath61",
    "continuously increases by a factor of 50 when going from room temperature to @xmath67 . since the temperature is always larger than the tunnelling integral along the @xmath2 direction , the conductivity is always incoherent along this axis and measures in fact the tunnelling density of states between the planes .",
    "below @xmath153  k , the dc resistivity of 6  follows a power - law @xmath154 , as expected for a fermi liquid with electron - electron scattering , and @xmath155 .",
    "this last behavior is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : luttinger2 ] ) when the planes are in a fermi liquid state since then @xmath156 . from the power - law @xmath157 we found above @xmath158",
    "k the corresponding luttinger - liquid exponent can be calculated to be @xmath159 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : luttinger1 ] ) and @xmath160 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the optical data value @xcite quoted above . for the @xmath2 direction",
    "we observe @xmath161 quite consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq : luttinger2 ] ) and the above value of @xmath162 ( which would lead to @xmath163 ) .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath78 is more complex since no simple power - law was found over the entire temperature range .",
    "however a change in the anisotropy behavior is clearly seen to take place above 100  k in fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] and the fit to a power - law in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcpf6v ] shows a downturn of the exponent from 0.65 to 0.24 .",
    "the data could thus be interpreted as due to a crossover regime between the low - temperature fermi liquid one and the high - temperature luttinger liquid .",
    "note that it is reasonable to expect a much larger crossover region for the @xmath1-axis transport , than for the @xmath2 axis given the much higher value of the transfer integral in this direction .",
    "the optical data along the @xmath2 axis @xcite is compatible with the above conclusions .",
    "the @xmath2-axis resistivity measured at 24  ghz possess the semiconductor - like behavior ( d@xmath164 ) in the high - temperature region @xmath165  k with the power - law @xmath166 . from this power - law",
    "we obtain @xmath167 , again in reasonable agreement with the other determinations of the luttinger - liquid exponent .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath1-axis optical data is more complex . given the above interpretation of the dc transport the system is clearly in the two - dimensional regime for temperatures below @xmath9  k and still in the crossover regime even up to room temperature .",
    "thus an interpretation of the optical data along the @xmath1 direction can only be done by using a two dimensional theory for the planes ( e.g.  along the lines of ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "note that the temperature dependence is quite sensitive to the moderate frequency change , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mwpf6total ] . after performing the conversion to constant - volume",
    ", we obtain @xmath168 in the temperature range 20  k@xmath9155  k. this is to be contrasted with the @xmath6 behavior observed in the dc transport in the same temperature range . the fact that a frequency of an energy corresponding to @xmath169  k gives such a change in the @xmath1-axis conductivity signals a very narrow drude peak , whose behavior remains clearly to be understood .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ] 4 ~    the situation is more complex for 4  which obviously exhibits a much more two - dimensional behavior . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dcclo4total ] the behavior along the @xmath0 and @xmath10 axes is quite similar over the whole temperature range , while the @xmath2 axis remains clearly metallic with a flattening only around @xmath170  k. this suggests that the crossover temperature in the case of 4is higher than @xmath171  k , which means that the dc transport is totally controlled by the two - dimensional physics .",
    "note that the optical data @xcite clearly shows for 4  the power - law behavior of a luttinger liquid at high energy , which is consistent with the existence of a crossover scale , but which in that case would be much higher than for 6 .",
    "however the dc behavior in the two - dimensional regime is still quite puzzling . from fig .",
    "[ fig : anisotropy ] the anisotropy is approximately temperature independent above @xmath172  k and roughly equal to @xmath173 . although the constant anisotropy is indeed to be expected if the system is in the two - dimensional regime the _ value _ is quite surprising since it is much _ lower _ than the ratio that would be expected from the hopping integral , and that would be quite similar to the one actually measured for the case of 6 .",
    "the reason for such a low value remains to be understood .",
    "the increase of the anisotropy ( of about a factor of two until the transition ) is reminiscent of the one occurring in 6  but on a much broader temperature range ( @xmath9  k instead of less than @xmath174  k for the later ) .",
    "note also that the exponents for the dc transport are quite different than the ones for 6 .",
    "although 6  was having the exponents expected for two - dimensional planes in a fermi - liquid states ( @xmath6 for @xmath0 and @xmath10 axes and @xmath72 for the incoherent hopping along @xmath2 direction ) one finds , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcclo4v ] , exponents for the three axis between @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "this difference between 6 and 4 , and specially the low value of the anisotropy ration is quite puzzling .",
    "in particular it is expected that a universal phase diagram would hold for the organics @xcite , in which one could go from one chemical compound to the other by applying pressure .",
    "this property clearly holds for the various instabilities .",
    "it would thus be interesting to make a detailed comparison between 6 under pressure and 4 as far as their transport properties are concerned to check how much of the transport properties of 4 can be recovered .",
    "note in particular that it would be unlikely given the amount of pressure to apply to 6 to change the hopping integrals sufficiently to explain , simply by a modification of the hopping integrals , the low anisotropy ratio observed in 4 .",
    "the comparison of the power - laws found in the temperature dependent dc and microwave resistivity of 6  and 4  yields a complex picture .",
    "the quadratic behavior found along the chains of 6  is reduced to @xmath177 above the dimensional crossover around 70 to 100  k ; in 6  we find a maximum in the resistivity @xmath62 around 80  k. the longitudinal and transverse properties in this material are qualitatively consistent from what it to be expected from a system of coupled one - dimensional chains , having a crossover from a luttinger - liquid at high temperature to a two - dimensional ( fermi liquid ) like behavior at low temperatures .    on the contrary ,",
    "even if optical data shows in 4  a one dimensional luttinger - liquid behavior at high energy , the dc transport shows clearly that below ambient temperature , 4  is in a two - dimensional regime .",
    "the third direction of 4  is metallic in the entire temperature range with some indications to a semiconducting behavior above room temperature , indicating that the crossover temperature should be above ambient temperature .",
    "quite surprisingly the anisotropy ratio , of about @xmath173 , is quite low and much lower that what would be expected from the ration of the transfer integrals .",
    "given the idea of a universal phase diagram where change of chemistry would be equivalent to pressure , these measurements suggest a careful comparison between 6under pressure and 4 to determine the similarities and differences of the two systems .",
