    "the main purpose of this section is to prove the following :    [ centre ] there exists an algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary finite presentation of a biautomatic group and which gives as output the isomorphism type of the centre of the group , and a finite set of words that generate the centre .",

    "* chapter 5 ) an algorithm is described which , given a finite presentation for an automatic group , will produce an automatic structure for the group .",

    "we describe the changes needed to the algorithm in section 5.2 of @xcite .    given a finite state automaton @xmath48 with accepted language @xmath32 ( over the given generating set ) , the algorithm given in @xcite will , if @xmath32 is part of an automatic structure , eventually terminate and give a full description of the automatic structure ( i.e. , all multiplier automata and the equality checker ) .",
    "let @xmath49 be a finite state automaton with accepted language @xmath37 . applying this algorithm to both @xmath48 and @xmath49 gives an algorithm which will terminate if @xmath32 is a biautomatic structure .",
    "using a standard diagonal argument , this procedure is applied ` simultaneously ' to all pairs of finite state automata @xmath50 with the given input alphabet .",
    "the fact that the group is biautomatic ensures that at some point the algorithm terminates .",

    "there exists an algorithm that , given a biautomatic structure ( @xmath38 ) for a group @xmath0 , will calculate the sublanguage of @xmath32 that evaluates onto the centre of @xmath0 ( i.e. , the language @xmath51 ) .",

    "therefore , since the intersection of finitely many regular languages is regular , it suffices to construct a finite state automaton over @xmath24 with accepted language @xmath66 .",

    "proposition [ find ] yields an explicit biautomatic structure for @xmath0 , together with a fellow - traveller constant @xmath39 for that structure .",
    "in the course of the preceding proof we implicitly showed that @xmath76 is generated by words from @xmath25 that have length at most @xmath77 .",

    "it follows that one obtains a finite presentation for @xmath76 by simply calculating which concatenations of strings of generators of @xmath76 , with total length @xmath79 $ ] in @xmath25 , represent @xmath80 .",

    "the isomorphism problem for abelian groups is solvable and one can make an explicit list @xmath81 of finite presentations , exactly one for each isomorphism type of finitely generated abelian group .",
    "one then looks for an isomorphism between @xmath76 and the groups on this list by simply enumerating homomorphisms from @xmath76 to each of the groups and _ vice versa _ , looking for an inverse pair , as in lemma [ partisoalg ] . in more detail : for each of the presentations on the list @xmath81 , the construction of lemma [ partisoalg ] provides a partial algorithm that will successfully terminate if the group @xmath82 is isomorphic to @xmath76 ; the algorithm that we are describing here runs in a diagonal manner  first it runs one step of the procedure that looks for an isomorphism between @xmath76 and @xmath83 , then one step of the procedure comparing @xmath76 to @xmath84 , then a further two steps comparing @xmath76 to @xmath83 , to @xmath84 , and to @xmath85 ; then a further three steps of the procedures comparing @xmath76 to @xmath83 , to @xmath84 , to @xmath85 , and to @xmath86 , and so on .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition [ centre ] .",
    "[ sec1 ] in deciding the isomorphism class of @xmath76 above , we appealed to the general solution for the isomorphism problem for finitely generated abelian groups . in the final section we present some results which provide a more efficient search that exploits the rational structure on @xmath76 .    in the proof of proposition [ centre ] we used the following general and well - known result , which we make explicit for the sake of clarity .",
    "[ partisoalg ] there is a partial algorithm that , given two finite presentations , will search for an isomorphism between the two groups : if the presentations define isomorphic groups then this procedure will eventually halt ; if the groups are not isomorphic then it will not terminate .    given finite presentations @xmath87 and @xmath88 defining groups @xmath83 and @xmath84 , one can enumerate all homomorphisms from @xmath83 to @xmath84 by running through all choices of words @xmath89 in the free group on @xmath90 , treating these as putative images of the generators of @xmath83 in @xmath84 : one freely reduces the words obtained by substituting @xmath91 for each occurrence of @xmath92 in the relations @xmath93  call these words @xmath94 ; one tries to verify that @xmath95 defines a homomorphism @xmath96 by listing all products of conjugates of the relations @xmath97 , freely reducing them and comparing the freely - reduced form to the words @xmath98 ; the assignment @xmath95 defines a homomorphism @xmath96 if and only if this procedure eventually produces all of the words @xmath98 .",
    "one applies the same process with the indices reversed to enumerate all homomorphisms from @xmath84 to @xmath83 . in parallel , one tests all pairs of homomorphisms @xmath99 and @xmath100 that are found in order to see if they are mutually inverse . again",
    "this test is carried out by a naive search : the homomorphisms are described by explicit formulae saying where they send the generators , so to check that @xmath101 , for example , one simply has to check if a list of words @xmath102 defines the same indexed set of elements of @xmath83 as @xmath103 ; one is interested only in a positive answer , so one does not need a solution to the word problem for this , one just enumerates all products of conjugates of the relations @xmath104 , checking to see if each is _ freely _ equal to @xmath105 .",
    "given a group @xmath10 and an abelian group @xmath22 , a group @xmath106 is called a central extension of @xmath10 by @xmath22 if there is a short exact sequence @xmath107 and the map @xmath108 induced by conjugation in @xmath106 is trivial .",
    "we remind the reader that such central extensions are classified up to equivalence by the cohomology class @xmath109\\in h^2(g , a)$ ] of the cocycle @xmath110 that is defined by choosing a set - theoretic section @xmath111 of the given surjection and setting @xmath112 ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "if @xmath121 or @xmath122 , then we conclude that the original groups @xmath123 and @xmath124 are not isomorphic .",
