    "this procedure is made only for convenience in the computational process .",
    "now , we make a comment about the evaluation of the first diagram in the second line of fig.[fig : nd capture ] .",
    "this diagram is different somewhat from other ones because it has two contributions corresponding to the poles in the nucleon propagators before and after the photon creation .",
    "therefore , these two poles are corresponding to two contributions , one is that the photon is emitted during the exchange of a nucleon and the other is that the photon is emitted after exchanging the nucleon .",
    "if we add the half - offshell @xmath74 scattering amplitude from left to the first diagram in the first line of fig.[fig : nd capture ] , we miss the contribution of the case that the photon emission occurs during the nucleon exchange .",
    "so , we have to replace the half - offshell @xmath74 scattering amplitude by four diagrams which are introduced in fig.[fig : nd scattering ] .",
    "thus , we must substitute the first diagrams of the second line by four diagrams introduced in the third line of fig.[fig : nd capture ] .",
    "the effect of the photon emitted during the exchange of another nucleon can also be applied when the triton formation precedes the photon - nucleon interaction .",
