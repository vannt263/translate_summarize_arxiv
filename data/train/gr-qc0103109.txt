    "the problem of initial conditions ( initial cauchy data ) for the integration of the evolution of colliding black holes is an important problem of the numerical general relativity and has attracted attention of many researchers .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "one of the approaches to the problem is a conformal - imaging method proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another is the conformal - puncture method @xcite .",
    "it is known that initial black hole data constructed using both these methods contains some non - vanishing dynamical component @xcite , an unphysical , junk gravitational field . without the integration of the initial data in time",
    "it is impossible to make exact conclusions about the character and the amount of this unphysical field .",
    "still it is possible to make some conclusions about the junk field using only the initial data .",
    "for example , one can numerically calculate global characteristics of the initial data such as total energy , and then compare it with known analytical or approximate solutions @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "in our previous paper we developed adaptive mesh refinement approach to the construction of initial data for black hole collisions on high resolution cartesian meshes @xcite .",
    "the method allows us to compute initial data with high accuracy both near and very far away the from black holes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to use this method to systematically analyze the physical properties of black hole initial data for a wide range of colliding black hole configurations . to analyze the junk fields present in the data",
    ", we will use two different approaches .",
    "first , we calculate and compare global characteristics of the configurations . in addition",
    ", we use a new approach which consists of calculating and comparing four local scalar invariants of the gravitational field ( @xcite , section 92 ) .",
    "these scalar invariants completely determine local properties ( tidal forces ) of a gravitational field .    in the next section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we briefly describe our adaptive mesh refinement method of calculating initial black hole data .",
    "we start our discussion of local and global characterization of the solutions in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "results for single black hole configurations with angular or linear momenta are presented in section [ sec:4 ] . for these black holes",
    "we can compare numerical initial date with exact analytical solutions . in section [ sec:5 ] we present results for two - black hole configurations with different orientations of linear and angular momenta and with different separations between the black holes .",
    "all calculations are performed using both conformal - imaging and conformal - puncture methods , and the results are compared .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "the adm or 3 + 1 formulation of the equations of general relativity works with the metric @xmath2 and extrinsic curvature @xmath3 of three - dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces embedded in the four - dimensional space - time , where @xmath4 , and the superscript @xmath5 denotes the physical space . on the initial hypersurface , @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "must satisfy the constraint equations @xcite .",
    "the conformal approach assumes that the metric is conformally flat , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the metric of a background flat space .",
    "this conformal transformation induces the corresponding transformation of the extrinsic curvature @xmath8 with the additional assumption of @xmath9 the energy and momentum constraints are @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the laplacian and covariant derivative in flat space .",
    "a solution to ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) for two black holes can be specified by six parameters ( three parameters per black hole ) .",
    "these are the mass parameter @xmath14 , linear momentum parameter @xmath15 and angular momentum parameters @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the index of a black hole . in terms of these parameters , the solution to the momentum constraint for two black holes is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) the comma separates the index of black hole from the coordinate component indices , @xmath21 is the black hole throat radius , and @xmath22 is the unit vector directed from the center of the @xmath23-th black hole @xmath24 to the point @xmath25 .",
    "we work in units where @xmath26 which means that @xmath15 is in mass units and @xmath16 is in mass@xmath27 units .    in the conformal - imaging method",
    ", we obtain an inversion - symmetric solution to ( [ eq:5 ] ) by applying an infinite series of mirror operators to ( [ eq:6 ] ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "note , that before applying the mirror operators to @xmath28 , this term must be divided by 2 since the image operators will double its value .",
    "the series converges rapidly , and in practice only a few terms are taken . after the isometric solution for @xmath29 is found , ( [ eq:4 ] ) must be solved subject to the isometry boundary condition at the black hole throats @xmath30    in the conformal - puncture method , expression ( [ eq:6 ] ) is used without mirror imaging , and the energy constraint is solved on @xmath31 with a puncture at the center of each hole . brandt and br@xmath32gmann @xcite proved that it suffices to solve the energy constraint everywhere on @xmath31 without any points cut out .",
    "thus , this method avoids inner boundaries .",
    "the outer boundary condition in both cases is @xmath33 at infinity .",
    "this boundary condition is represented by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the distance from the center of the computational domain to the boundary .    as described in @xcite , ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] )",
    "are solved on an adaptive cartesian mesh .",
    "the mesh is refined on the level of individual cells using a fully threaded tree structure @xcite .",
    "computational cells can be characterized by the level of cells @xmath36 in the tree .",
    "a cell size @xmath37 is related to the cell level as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the size of the computational domain . in this paper , @xmath40 and the minimum and maximum levels of refinement",
    "is @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "that is , the coarsest cells had a size @xmath43 and the finest cell size was @xmath44 .",
    "the unit of length is the throat radius @xmath21 of the holes ( in this paper , all holes have the same mass @xmath45 and thus the same throat radius ) .",
    "the equivalent uniform grid resolution thus corresponded to that of a @xmath46 uniform grid .",
    "mesh was refined at @xmath47 according to the following refinement criterium ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath48 mesh was refined at levels @xmath49 if @xmath50 and at @xmath51 if @xmath52 . in our previous paper it was demonstrated that our mesh refinement approach gives a quadratic convergence of solutions with increasing numerical resolution . in this paper",
    "we additionally checked the accuracy of numerical solutions by varying @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the accuracy of the results is discussed further in sections [ sec:4 ] and [ sec:5 ] .",
    "global physical properties of a system are its total mass @xmath0 , linear , @xmath56 , and angular , @xmath57 , momentum @xcite . for conformally flat solutions",
    "@xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 where integration is performed over the surface at infinity . for our case of two black holes , the total linear and angular momenta are equal to @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 are centers of black hole throats or punctures and @xmath64 is the center of mass of the system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note , that @xmath65 do not have direct physical meaning but @xmath56 and @xmath66 do .",
    "in addition to global characteristics of a system , we can also consider local invariants .",
    "in general case , there are four such invariants ( @xcite , section 92 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a fully antisymmetric unit tensor in curved coordinates . at every point , in a specially selected tetrad",
    ", the riemann tensor can be expressed in terms of these invariants ( except of special degenerate cases @xcite ) .",
    "since riemann tensor uniquely determines tidal forces , these invariants fully characterize physical properties of the field at every point .",
    "the tidal force is @xmath70 by the order of magnitude . for a schwarzschild black hole , for example",
    ", the tidal force is exactly @xmath71 @xcite .    in order to calculate the riemann tensor",
    ", we need to know the space and time derivatives of the four - dimensional metric at each point on the initial slice .",
    "this data can be obtained from the time - evolution part of the einstein equations .",
    "since the scalars do not depend on the choice of a coordinate system , we can select zero shift and unit lapse to simplify calculations , and to write the derivatives as @xmath72 here both @xmath73 are the physical metric and extrinsic curvature , and not their counterparts in flat space , and @xmath74 is the ricci tensor of 3-dimensional space which depends only on the spatial metric and it s spatial derivatives .",
    "we consider a single black hole with a non - zero angular momentum @xmath75 and zero linear momentum @xmath76 , and compare numerical conformal solutions with the known analytical solution for a kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr metric is @xmath77 where @xmath78 the analytical solution ( 19),(20 ) is described by two parameters , the total mass of the hole @xmath0 measured at infinity , and the specific angular momentum @xmath79 such that @xmath80 .",
    "the irreducible mass of a kerr black hole , i.e. , the mass of the event horizon of the hole is given by @xmath81    we have calculated datasets with single rotating black holes using both the imaging and puncture method . in each case , we vary the @xmath82 parameter , but hold the mass parameter of the black hole , @xmath83 , constant .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of the solutions by varying @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath53 in ( [ eq:11 ] ) . for each dataset we computed @xmath0 and @xmath84 by evaluating ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) over at sphere with radius @xmath85 .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath0 , @xmath86 calculated at this radius were third digit accurate . the integration in ( [ eq:12 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) is supposed to be over at surface at infinity , and we determined @xmath87 and @xmath88 from the corresponding values at finite radii by extrapolation in @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows the extrapolation procedure for a rotating black hole with @xmath91 calculated with the imaging method . @xmath0 and @xmath84",
    "have been calculated by integrating over spheres with increasing radii , @xmath35 .",
    "we find a least square fit of the data to a second order polynomial and evaluate that polynomial at @xmath92 to obtain @xmath88 and @xmath87 . for rotating black hole ,",
    "the values of @xmath0 are practically not changing with @xmath35 , whereas the values of @xmath88 are slightly larger than the values at finite @xmath35 . for a case",
    "@xmath91 , the extrapolated value @xmath93 , as it should be .",
    "the asymptotic value of @xmath0 is in a good agreement with that obtained in @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] shows @xmath87 as a function of @xmath82 .    in the conformal - imaging approach ,",
    "the location of an apparent horizon for a single rotating black hole coincides with the throat @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case it is possible to investigate the properties of the apparent horizon .",
    "we have computed the area of the horizon @xmath94 , the mass , @xmath95 and the polar and equatorial circumference , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the values of @xmath98 agree within three digits with the corresponding values in @xcite for @xmath99 .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows calculated @xmath0 and @xmath98 as a function of @xmath82 for a rotating black hole with @xmath83 .",
    "also shown is the irreducible mass @xmath100 calculated for a kerr black hole with the corresponding @xmath82 and @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows the calculated ratio of the polar and equatorial circumferences @xmath101 as a function of @xmath82 and compares it with the corresponding ratio for a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] shows that for the same total mass of the configuration @xmath0 and the same angular momentum @xmath82 , the mass of the apparent horizon in the numerical data , @xmath98 , is less than the irreducible mass of the black hole .",
    "this is expected since in the conformal approach there is an additional energy / mass related to a junk field outside of the black hole .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows that @xmath101 is close to unity for conformal imaging solutions whereas for kerr black hole it is less than one .",
    "this means that the shape of the apparent horizon is substantially closer to spherical symmetry in the conformal - imaging solutions than for a kerr black hole .",
    "we have also compared the scalar invariants ( 17 ) of our numerical solutions with the corresponding analytical values .",
    "the difference between the values of these invariants of the numerical and and analytical solutions characterize the junk gravitational field . we have chosen to compare the value of the invariant in the points that are the same physical distance from the apparent horizon along the equatorial axis of the black hole , because this gives us a correspondence between the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate @xmath35 of the kerr metric and the isotropic radial coordinate @xmath102 of the numerical solution . in the numerical solution",
    "the apparent horizon coincides with the throat , and in the kerr solution the apparent horizon coincides with the event horizon . to find the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate @xmath35 that corresponds to a given isotropic coordinate @xmath102 we find the physical distance : @xmath103 where @xmath102 is the distance to the center of the black hole throat in the background flat space and @xmath104 is the throat radius .",
    "the integration is performed numerically using cubic spline quadrature .",
    "we normalize this distance : @xmath105 and we write down the following implicit equation : @xmath106 and solve it with respect to @xmath35 using van wijngaarden - dekker - brent s method .",
    "@xmath0 is the total mass of the numerical black hole with mass parameter @xmath107 , as well as the total mass of the kerr black hole that we are comparing to .",
    "finally we compute the value of the invariants for the kerr black hole ( which are known analytically ) at @xmath108 .",
    "figure ( [ fig:5 ] ) shows that increasing value of @xmath82 leads to the decrease of @xmath109 at the black hole horizon for kerr black holes .",
    "this is a well understood effect : from ( [ fig:3 ] ) we know that the total mass of a black hole and its apparent horizon grow with @xmath82 and we know that in the kerr solution tidal forces at the event horizon of a kerr black hole decrease with the increase of the mass .",
    "we can see that the same tendency holds for conformal black holes ( figure [ fig:5 ] a , b ) .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] c shows the difference in @xmath109 for the conformal and kerr solutions . at the boundary of the black hole the absolute value of the difference initially decreases with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "however , for large @xmath82 it begins to decrease due to the decrease of tidal forces .",
    "figure  [ fig:5]d shows the relative difference in @xmath109 .",
    "the absolute value of the relative difference at the black hole boundary increases with increasing @xmath82 monotonically . far away from the black hole , the absolute value of the difference is also monotonically increases with @xmath82 , and for large values of @xmath82 it is significantly larger than that at the black hole boundary .",
    "figure [ fig:3 ] thus shows that there exists a junk gravitational field in the conformal solutions , and that the relative amount of this junk field increases outside of the black hole with increasing @xmath82 .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the relative difference of @xmath109 at large distances .",
    "the relative difference is remains large even at very large @xmath110 .",
    "now consider a single black hole with a non - zero linear momentum @xmath111 and zero angular momentum @xmath112 .",
    "similar to rotating black holes , we compute numerical conformal solutions with @xmath83 and various @xmath113 , calculate @xmath0 and @xmath114 for these solutions by integrating ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) over spherical surfaces of different radii @xmath35 , and then extrapolate these values to infinity . figure [ fig:7 ] illustrates the extrapolation procedure for the case @xmath83 and @xmath115 . in the case of a boosted black hole ,",
    "both @xmath0 and @xmath114 vary noticeably with @xmath35 . the extrapolated value of @xmath116 , as it should be .",
    "we compare our numerical solutions with known analytical solutions for a boosted schwarzschild black hole with the same @xmath87 and @xmath117 .",
    "the spatial metric of a boosted schwarzschild black hole can be found by performing a lorenz transformation @xmath118 of a schwarzschild metric , where @xmath119 .",
    "this gives the following spacetime metric @xmath120 with @xmath121 the analytical solution ( [ eq:26 ] ) is described by the two parameters , the mass of the schwarzschild black hole @xmath122 and the velocity of the hole @xmath123 as measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "the total mass and velocity of a boosted schwarzschild black hole are @xmath124    at the horizon , the metric is exactly the same as for a schwarzschild black hole ( this can be seen from the fact that @xmath125 at the horizon ) .",
    "thus , the horizon properties are the same as for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "also , since we have only performed a coordinate transformation , @xmath109 for a boosted schwarzschild black hole is the same as @xmath109 for a schwarzschild black hole .    in the conformal - imaging approach ,",
    "the location of an apparent horizon for a moving black hole coincides with the throat @xcite and for a schwarschild black hole the apparent horizon coincides with the event horizon .",
    "we have computed the area of the horizon @xmath94 , the mass , @xmath95 and the polar and equatorial circumference , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] shows calculated @xmath0 and @xmath98 as a function of @xmath113 for a moving black hole with @xmath83 .",
    "also shown is the analytical horizon mass @xmath126 .",
    "figure [ fig:8 ] shows that for the same total mass of the configuration @xmath0 and the same linear momentum @xmath113 , the mass of the calculated apparent horizon @xmath98 is less than the analytical one .",
    "this is expected since in the conformal approach there is an additional energy related to a junk field outside of the black hole .",
    "the polar and equatorial circumferences for a moving black hole are practically the same , i.e. the symmetry of the horizon is close to spherical symmetry .",
    "we have compared the scalar invariants ( 17 ) of our numerical solutions with the corresponding analytical values .",
    "we have chosen to compare the value of the invariant in the points that are the same physical distance from the apparent horizon along the axis of motion ( the x - axis ) .",
    "this physical distance can be expressed as a function of the isotropic coordinate distance @xmath102 from the black hole center along the axis of motion to the point where we make the comparison .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] compares @xmath109 as a function of @xmath102 for various values of @xmath113 .",
    "we see that the increase of the total mass with increasing @xmath113 leads to a decrease in the value of @xmath109 at the black hole horizon ( figure [ fig:9 ] a , b ) .",
    "figure [ fig:9]c shows the difference in @xmath109 for numerical and analytical solutions . at the black hole boundary ,",
    "the absolute value of the difference initially decreases with increasing @xmath113 .",
    "however for large @xmath113 it begins to decrease due to the decrease of tidal forces .",
    "figure [ fig:9]d shows the relative difference in @xmath109 .",
    "the absolute value of the relative difference at the black hole boundary first increases with increasing @xmath113 but than starts do decrease . far away from the black hole ,",
    "values of @xmath109 for boosted black holes are much larger than @xmath109 for conformal black hole solutions ( figure [ fig:10 ] ) .",
    "similar to the rotating black hole case , figure [ fig:9 ] show that conformal solutions contain a junk gravitational field . the amount of the junk field increases outside of the black hole with increasing @xmath113 .",
    "there is an infinite number of possibilities for choosing the parameters that characterize the initial data for two black holes .",
    "the problem can be parameterized by @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath14 is the mass parameter of the @xmath23th black hole . @xmath129 and @xmath130 are the coordinates of the center of the throats and punctures respectively .",
    "we chose to call the distance @xmath131 the separation of the hole . since the holes are placed at equal distance from the center of the computational domain , @xmath132 is the coordinate distance from the center of each hole to the center of the domain .",
    "the rest of the parameters are the linear / angular momentum parameters .",
    "we restrict ourselves to some specific case .",
    "we consider configurations with equal mass black holes , @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath134 . the line connecting the centers of the holes coincides with the x - axis .",
    "we only investigate configurations where the holes have either linear momenta or angular momenta , but not both .",
    "the configurations considered are shown schematically on figure [ fig:11 ] .",
    "arrows on this figure show the direction of either linear or angular momenta . in all cases when momenta of both black holes are not zero",
    ", they have equal absolute values except when explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "first we mention the following general property of our initial data .",
    "let the linear momentum parameters of the problem are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , and the angular momentum parameters for both holes are zero .",
    "then the metric that is a solution to the constraint equations , ( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) with these parameters is the same as the metric of that is the solution to the constraint equations where the linear momentum parameters are @xmath137 and @xmath138 , i.e. the problem where the sign of all components of the linear momentum parameters has been reversed .",
    "the proof can be found in appendix a. it is also possible to prove that a solution where the parameters @xmath139 and @xmath140 and @xmath141 has some non - zero values will have the same metric as a solution with parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "therefore , configurations e and f ( figure [ fig:11 ] ) , will have the same total mass @xmath0 .",
    "the same holds for configurations b and c.    for configurations with linear momenta , we will compare numerical results for @xmath0 with the predictions of special theory of relativity , @xmath144 equation ( [ eq:30 ] ) ignores gravitational interaction between the holes .",
    "we also can compare @xmath0 of a two black hole configuration @xmath145 with the sum @xmath146 of numerical @xmath0 of individual black holes with parameters @xmath147 and @xmath148 , @xmath149 again , @xmath146 ignores mutual gravitational interaction of the black holes .    for configurations with angular momenta , we can compare numerical @xmath0 with @xmath150 similar to the linear momentum case .",
    "now we discuss configurations without linear or angular momentum and configurations with linear momentum @xmath151 and with varying separation @xmath132 between the holes . for these configurations",
    ", we found that the difference between @xmath0 extrapolated to @xmath92 and @xmath0 evaluated at @xmath152 is of the order of 1% . in",
    "what follows , we present values of @xmath0 evaluated at @xmath152 .",
    "figure [ fig:12 ] shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath132 for case a , the configuration of two black holes without linear or angular momentum .",
    "the exact solution for this case can be found with the semi - analytic method described in @xcite .",
    "as one can see , the total mass converges to 4.0 when the distance between the holes increases .",
    "this is expected , because the gravitational attraction between the holes ( which also contributes to the total mass ) becomes negligible as the distance between the holes gets larger , and the holes can be regarded as point particles .",
    "however , the gravitational attraction should decrease the total mass , but we see that @xmath0 increases or is constant with decreasing @xmath132 . this behavior clearly shows the presence of an extra gravitational field that artificially cancels the effects of gravity on the total mass ( in the puncture data ) or adds even more energy that the amount required to cancel out the effect on the total mass ( in the imaging data ) .",
    "the puncture solutions contain less junk that the imaging solutions .",
    "figures [ fig:13a ] and [ fig:13b ] show @xmath0 for cases b , c and d which contain one black hole with linear momentum @xmath151 another with @xmath153 .",
    "the figures show that , in both conformal - imaging and puncture methods , @xmath0 is practically independent of orientation of @xmath154 with respect to the line passing through the black hole centers . at large separations , @xmath0 for both methods does not tend to the special relativity limit @xmath155 .",
    "instead @xmath0 tends to @xmath146 ( equation ( 28 ) ) .",
    "this shows that even at larger separations , the solutions contain a junk gravitational field .",
    "this junk field is associated with the junk fields of individual solution for black hole with @xmath151 . from the comparison at small separations we see",
    "that puncture solutions contain less junk than conformal imaging solutions .",
    "figures [ fig:14a ] and [ fig:14b ] show @xmath0 for cases where both black holes have linear momentum @xmath151 but with different relative orientations .",
    "we see that @xmath0 for these cases depend on relative orientation of @xmath154 .",
    "when @xmath135 and @xmath136 are antiparallel , @xmath0 is practically the same , independent of orientation of @xmath154 ( compare cases e , f and j ) .",
    "these configurations also have minimal masses compared to other cases at the same separations .",
    "configuration g with parallel momenta gives the largest @xmath0 which is almost independent of @xmath132 .",
    "configurations h and i with perpendicular momenta are intermediate between parallel and antiparallel cases . at large separations",
    ", @xmath0 seems to tend to @xmath146 taking into account that @xmath0 computed at @xmath152 is slightly less than @xmath0 at @xmath92 .",
    "again , we conclude from figures [ fig:14a ] and [ fig:14b ] that both conformal - imaging and puncture solutions contain junk fields .",
    "the amount of junk appears to be less in the puncture method .",
    "figures [ fig:15a ] and [ fig:15b ] show @xmath0 as a function of @xmath113 for black hole configuration b with only one black hole having non - zero @xmath151 and for configurations e and g with anti - parallel and parallel linear momenta @xmath151 for the separation @xmath156 between the black holes .",
    "we see that @xmath0 is somewhat larger for black holes with parallel momenta than for black holes with anti - parallel momenta .",
    "this is the same tendency which we already saw on figures [ fig:14a ] and [ fig:14b ] .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath0 for cases e and g are somewhat smaller that the sum of @xmath0 of single black hole with the same values of @xmath113 .",
    "for case b , @xmath0 is very close to the sum of @xmath0 a schwarzschild black hole with @xmath153 and a boosted black hole with linear momentum @xmath151 .",

    ", @xmath0 tends to the sum of @xmath0 for two individual rotating black hole with @xmath158 .",

    "we found that at this separation , @xmath0 for all of these configurations practically coincide with the sum of @xmath0 of two individual black holes with the corresponding momenta .",
    "we calculated conformal initial value data for single and binary black hole configurations on a high - resolution , adaptively refined cartesian mesh using both conformal - imaging and conformal - puncture methods .",
    "adaptive mesh refinement approach allowed us to obtain accurate three - dimensional numerical solutions both near and far away from black hole for a wide range of black hole configurations with various linear and angular momenta and various black hole separations .",
    "the equivalent uniform - grid resolution obtained in the calculations was @xmath46 .",
    "determination of the total mass @xmath0 of configurations required an integration over a surface at infinity ( [ eq:12 ] ) . using numerical values of @xmath0 obtained by integration over a sphere at large finite radii @xmath160 , where @xmath161 allowed us to obtain @xmath87 by extrapolation . for configurations with large linear momenta , the difference between @xmath87 and @xmath162 was as large as @xmath163 .",
    "the difference was substantially smaller for configurations with large angular momenta .",
    "comparison with known analytic solutions was then performed using asymptotic values of @xmath87 .    for a single rotating black hole ,",
    "the mass of the calculated apparent horizon @xmath98 is less than the irreducible mass of a kerr black hole with the same @xmath0 . for a single boosted black hole ,",
    "the calculated @xmath98 is less than that of the corresponding boosted schwarzschild black hole .",
    "this shows that the junk field is present in the conformal solutions .",
    "comparison of the spatial distribution of local invariants for both rotating and boosted black hole shows that junk field is present at large distances from the holes . for a rotating black hole ,",
    "the shape of the numerical apparent horizon is much more spherical than that of a kerr black hole .",
    "it appears the conformal approach generates more spherically - symmetric solutions .    for two - black hole configurations , with increasing separation @xmath132 between the black holes",
    "the value of @xmath164 tends to the sum of @xmath0 of two individual single - black holes numerical solutions containing their corresponding junk fields . if only one of the black holes has a non - zero linear or angular momentum , the value of @xmath0 is practically independent of the orientation of the momentum . for black holed both having non - zero angular momentum , @xmath0 is also practically independent of the orientation of the momenta . for black hole",
    "both having non - zero linear momenta , the value of @xmath0 is maximal for parallel momenta and minimal for anti - parallel momenta .",
    "in general , the conformal - puncture method appears to generate less junk gravitational field than the conformal - imaging method .",
    "this work confirms that conformal initial conditions are not suitable as initial conditions for astrophysical black hole collisions since they contain junk gravitational field .",
    "they are useful as initial conditions for testing time - integration schemes for black hole collisions because black holes can be places at small initial separation .",
    "our adaptive mesh refinement approach allows to construct these initial data on a cartesian mesh with a high accuracy .",
    "we plane to use similar adaptive mesh refinement for the integration of these initial data in time .",
    "we thank kip thorne and members of his relativity group for useful discussions . n.",
    "jansen thanks the numerical relativity group at the max planck institut f@xmath32r gravitationsphysik , albert einstein institut for useful discussions .",
    "i. novikov thanks the nrl for hospitality during his stay . the work was supported in part by the nasa space astrophysics grant spa-00 - 067 , office of naval research , danish natural science research council grant no.9401635 , and by danmarks grundforskningsfond through its support for the establishment of the theoretical astrophysics center .",
    "* proposition : * let a configuration of two black holes be given .",
    "suppose that the linear momentum parameters of the problem are @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and that the angular momentum parameters for both holes are the null - vector .",
    "then the metric that is a solution to the constraint equations with these parameters is the same as the metric of that is the solution to the constraint equations where the linear momentum parameters are @xmath167 and @xmath168 , i.e. the problem where the sign of all components of the linear momentum parameters has been reversed .      as we can see",
    ", the extrinsic curvature enters only as @xmath170 .",
    "thus , to prove the proposition , we need to prove that this term does not depend on the sign of the linear momentum vectors . in the puncture formulation the extrinsic curvature tensor of the configuration @xmath171",
    "is given by : @xmath172 trivial manipulations give that : @xmath173 what s interesting about this equation is that each term have the product of two components of the momentum parameter vectors .",
    "thus , if we change the sign on all components of the momentum parameter vectors , it will not change anything in the value of the @xmath174 term , and thus the metric is conserved under such a sign change , at least in the puncture formulation . in the cook formulation , there are more terms in the expression for @xmath29 and @xmath175 but each of these terms is a product of some factor that depends on the position where we wish to find @xmath29 and of the extrinsic curvature tensor , evaluated at some different position .",
    "this means , that we multiply two terms where the normal - vector and the the radius that enters in the expression for the extrinsic curvature tensor are different , but the parameters p1 and p2 does not change .",
    "thus each term in the product @xmath174 will contain a product of two terms of the momentum vector parameters , and thus the whole expression is conserved under the sign change of @xmath176 .",
