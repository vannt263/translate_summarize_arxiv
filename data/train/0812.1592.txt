    "the presence of this factor inside the integral seems to be a robust property of the effects of imperfect measurements ( for brevity , we do not prove the generality of this statement , for instance by studying the effect of additional beam splitters that are inserted elsewhere , for instance in other parts of the interferometer ) .",
    "the discussion of the physical content of equation ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ proba ] ) is somewhat similar to that for spin measurements @xcite .",
    "one difference is that , here , we consider that the total number of measurements @xmath15 made by alice , as well as the total number of measurements @xmath16 made by bob , are left to fluctuate with a constant sum @xmath72 ; the particles emitted by the sources may localize in any of the four detection regions .  with spins ,",
    "the numbers of detections depends on the number of spin apparatuses used by alice and bob , so that it was more natural to assume that @xmath43 and @xmath46 are fixed .",
    "this changes the normalization and the probabilities , but not the dependence on the experimental parameters , which is given by ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ proba ] ) .",
    "a discussion of the normalization integrals is given in the appendix .",
    "if the numbers of particles in the sources are different@xmath124(@xmath125 ) , a term in @xmath126   $ ] appears in both equations ; let us assume for simplicity that all @xmath1 particles are measured @xmath127 , so that equation ( [ 19 ] ) applies , and for instance that @xmath128 .",
    "then , in the product of factors inside the integral , only some terms can provide a non - zero contribution after integration over @xmath70 ; we must choose at least @xmath129 factors contributing through @xmath130 , and thus at most @xmath131 factors contributing through the @xmath36 dependent terms .  therefore @xmath132 is the maximum number of particles providing results that depends on the settings of the interferometer ; all the others have equal probabilities @xmath133 , whatever the phase shift is .",
    "this is physically understandable , since @xmath134 particles from the first source unmatched particles from the other , and can thus not contribute to an interference effect .",
    "all particles can contribute coherently to the interference only if @xmath135 .",
    "if the numbers of particles in the sources are equal ( @xmath136 ) , the sources are optimal ; equation ( [ proba ] ) contains the effect of missing some particles in the measurements .",
    "if the number of experiments @xmath72 is much less than a very large @xmath1 , because @xmath137 peaks up sharply integration domain is between @xmath138 and @xmath139 ; otherwise , we should also take into account a peak around @xmath140 .",

    "@xcite or @xcite .",
    "suppose that we introduce a classical phase @xmath143 and calculate classically the interference effects at both beam splitters .",
    "this leads to intensities proportional to @xmath144   $ ] and @xmath145   $ ] on both sides of the interferometer in @xmath7 , and similar results for @xmath8 .",
    "now , if we assume that each particle reaching the beam splitter has crossing and reflecting probabilities that are proportional to these intensities ( we treat each of these individual processes as independent ) , and if we consider that this classical phase is completely unknown , an average over @xmath146 then reconstructs exactly ( [ 22 ] ) .  in this case ,",
    "the classical image of a pre - existing phase leads to predictions that are the same as those of quantum mechanics ; this phase will take a completely random value for each realization of the experiment , with for instance no way to force it to take related values in two successive runs .",
    "all this fits well within the concept of the anderson phase , originating from spontaneous symmetry breaking at the phase transition ( bose - einstein condensation ) : at this transition point , the quantum system chooses  a phase , which takes a completely random value , and then plays the role of a classical variable ( in the limit of very large systems ) .    on the other hand , if @xmath84 vanishes , the peaking effect of @xmath147 does not occur anymore",
    ", @xmath70 can take values close to @xmath34 , so that the terms in the product inside the integral are no longer necessarily positive ; an interpretation in terms of classical probabilities then becomes impossible .  in these cases ,",
    "the phase does not behave as a semi - classical variable , but retains a strong quantum character ; the variable @xmath70 controls the amount of quantum effects .",
    "it is therefore natural to call @xmath70 the quantum angle  and @xmath143 the classical phase .",
    "one could object that , if expression ( [ 19 ] ) contains negative factors , this does not prove that the same probabilities @xmath148 can not be obtained with another mathematical expression without negative probabilities .  to show that this is indeed impossible , we have to resort to a more general theorem , the bell / bchsh theorem , which proves it in a completely general way ; this is what we do in   [ epr ] .",
    "we now show that , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are equal and if the number of measurements is maximal ( @xmath95 ) , when alice and bob choose opposite , @xmath35 introduces a phase delay of source @xmath26 with respect to source @xmath27 , while @xmath36 does the opposite by delaying source @xmath27 with respect to source @xmath26 . therefore , the dephasing effects of the two delays are the same in both regions @xmath7 and @xmath8 when @xmath149 . ]",
    "phase shifts ( @xmath149 ) they always measure the same parity .  in this case , the integrand of ( [ 19 ] ) becomes:@xmath150   ^{m_{1}+m_{3}}\\left [   \\cos\\lambda-\\cos\\left (   \\lambda+\\zeta\\right )   \\right ]   ^{m_{2+}m_{4 } } \\label{integrand}\\ ] ] which can also be written as:@xmath151   ^{m_{1}+m_{3}}\\left [   \\sin(\\lambda^{\\prime\\prime}-\\frac{\\zeta}{2})\\right ]   ^{m_{1}+m_{3}}\\left [   \\cos(\\lambda^{\\prime}+\\frac{\\zeta}{2})\\right ]   ^{m_{2}+m_{4}}\\left [ \\cos(\\lambda^{\\prime\\prime}-\\frac{\\zeta}{2})\\right ]   ^{m_{2}+m_{4 } } \\label{integrand-2}\\ ] ] with the following change of integration variables and @xmath152 a range @xmath153   $ ] ; this doubles the integration domain , but this doubling is cancelled by a factor @xmath133 introduced by the jacobian.]:@xmath39{cc}\\lambda^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\lambda+\\lambda}{2 } & \\lambda^{\\prime\\prime}=\\frac{\\lambda-\\lambda}{2}\\end{array } \\label{lambdas}\\ ] ] if , for instance , @xmath154 is odd , instead of @xmath155 one can take @xmath156 as an integration variable , and one can see that the integral vanishes because its periodicity - the same is true of course for the @xmath152 integration , which also vanishes .",
    "similarly , if @xmath157 is odd , one can take @xmath158 and @xmath159 as integration variables , and the result vanishes again .",
    "finally , the probability is non - zero only if both @xmath154 and @xmath157 are even ; the conclusion is that alice and bob always observe the same parity for their results .",
    "this perfect correlation is useful for applying the epr  reasoning to parities .",
    "the advantage of measuring the positions of particles after a beam splitter , that is interference effects providing dichotomic results , is that one has a device that is close to quantum non - demolition experiments .  with a resonant laser",
    ", one can make an atom fluoresce and emit many photons , without transferring the atom from one arm of the interferometer to the other .",
    "this is clearly important in experiments where , as we have seen , all the atoms must be detected to obtain quantum non - local effects .  on the other hand ,",
    "it is well know experimentally that a difficulty with interferometry is the alignment of the devices in order to obtain an almost perfect matching of the wave front .",
    "we discuss this problem now .",
    "a general assumption behind the calculation of   [ quantum ] is that , in each region of space ( for instance at the inputs , or at the 4 outputs ) , only one mode of the field is populated ( only one @xmath160 operator is introduced per region ) .",
    "the advantage of this approach is its simplicity , but it nevertheless eludes some interesting questions .  for instance , suppose that the energies of the particles emerging from each source differ by some arbitrarily small quantity ; after crossing all beam splitters , they would reach the detection regions in two orthogonal modes , so that the probability of presence would be the sum of the corresponding probabilities , without any interference term .",
    "on the other hand , all interesting effects obtained in @xcite are precisely interference effects arising because , in each detection region , there is no way to tell which source emitted the detected particles .",
    "does this mean that these effects disappear as soon as the sources are not strictly identical , so that the quantum interferences will never be observable in practice ?    to answer this kind of question , here we will develop a more detailed theory of the detection of many particles in coincidence , somewhat similar to glauber s theory of photon coincidences @xcite ; nevertheless , while in that theory only the initial value of the n - th time derivative was calculated , here we study the whole time dependence of the correlation function .",
    "our result will be that , provided the interferometers and detectors are properly aligned , it is the detection process that restores the interesting quantum effects , even if the sources do not emit perfectly identical wavefronts in the detection regions , as was assumed in the calculations of   [ quantum ] .  as a consequence ,",
    "the reader who is not interested in experimental limitations may skip this section and proceed directly to   [ epr ] .    in this section",
    "we change the definition of the single particle states : @xmath26 now corresponds to a state for which the wave function originates from the first source , is split into two beams when reaching the first beam splitter , and into two beams again when it reaches the beam splitters associated with the regions of measurement @xmath7 and @xmath8 ;  the same is true for state @xmath27 .  in this point of view , all the propagation in the interferometers is already included in the states .",
    "we note in passing that the evolution associated with the beam splitters is unitary ; the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 therefore remain perfectly orthogonal , even if they overlap in some regions of space .",
    "having changed the definition of the single particle states , we keep ( [ 1 ] ) to define the n particle state of the system .",
    "we model the detectors sitting after the beam splitters by assuming that they are the juxtaposition of a large number @xmath161 of independent pixels , which we treat as independent detectors .",
    "this does not mean that the positions of the impact of all particles are necessarily registered in the experiment ; our calculations still apply if , for instance , only the total number of impact in each channel is recorded .",
    "the only thing we assume is that the detection of particles in different points leads to orthogonal states of some part of the apparatus ( or the environment ) , so that we can add the probabilities of the events corresponding to different orthogonal states ; whether or not the information differentiating these states is recorded in practice does not matter .",
    "if the number of pixels @xmath161 is very large , the probability of detection of two bosons at the same pixel is negligible .",
    "if we note @xmath162 , this probability is bounded by:@xmath163 so that we will assume that:@xmath164 moreover , we consider events where all @xmath1 particles are detected ( the probabilities of events where some particles are missed can be obtained from the probabilities of these events in a second step , as in @xcite ) .",
    "each pixel @xmath12 is considered as defining a region of space @xmath165 in which the particles are converted into a macroscopic electric current , as in a photomultiplier .",
    "the particles enter this region through the front surface @xmath166 of the pixel ; all particles crossing @xmath166 disappear in a conversion process that is assumed to have 100% efficiency .  what we need",

    "<S> when independent bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , described quantum mechanically by fock ( number ) states , are sent into interferometers , the measurement of the output port at which the particles are detected provides a binary measurement , with two possible results @xmath0 . with two interferometers and two bec s , </S>",
    "<S> the parity ( product of all results obtained at each interferometer ) has all the features of an einstein - podolsky - rosen quantity , with perfect correlations predicted by quantum mechanics when the settings ( phase shifts of the interferometers ) are the same .  </S>",
    "<S> when they are different , significant violations of bell inequalities are obtained .  </S>",
    "<S> these violations do not tend to zero when the number @xmath1 of particles increases , and can therefore be obtained with arbitrarily large systems , but a condition is that all particles should be detected . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the general experimental requirements for observing such effects , the necessary detection of all particles in correlation , the role of the pixels of the ccd detectors , and that of the alignments of the interferometers in terms of matching of the wave fronts of the sources in the detection regions .    </S>",
    "<S> another scheme involving three interferometers and three bec s is discussed ; it leads to greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) sign contradictions , as in the usual ghz  case with three particles , but for an arbitrarily large number of them .  </S>",
    "<S> finally , generalizations of the hardy impossibilities to an arbitrarily large number of particles are introduced . </S>",
    "<S> bec s provide a large versality for observing violations of local realism in a variety of experimental arrangements .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : 03.65.ud , 03.75.gg , 42.50.xa    the original einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) argument @xcite considers a system of two microscopic particles that are correlated ; assuming that various types of measurements are performed on this system in remote locations , and using local realism , it shows that the system contains more elements of reality  than those contained in quantum mechanics .  </S>",
    "<S> bohr gave a refutation of the argument @xcite by pointing out that intrinsic physical properties should not be attributed to microscopic systems , independently of their measurement apparatuses ; in his view of quantum mechanics ( often called orthodox ) , the notion of reality introduced by epr  is inappropriate .  </S>",
    "<S> later , bell extended the epr  argument and used inequalities to show that local realism and quantum mechanics may sometimes lead to contradictory predictions @xcite .  using pairs of correlated photons emitted in a cascade , clauser et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite checked that , even in this case , the results of quantum mechanics are correct ; other experiments leading to the same conclusion were performed by fry et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , aspect et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and many others .  </S>",
    "<S> the body of all results is now such that it is generally agreed that violations of the bell inequalities do occur in nature , even if experiments are never perfect and if loopholes  ( such as sample bias @xcite ) can still be invoked in principle .  </S>",
    "<S> all these experiments were made with a small number of particles , generally a pair of photons , so that bohr s point of view directly applies to them .    in this article , as in @xcite we consider systems made of an arbitrarily large number of particles , and study some of their variables that can lead to an epr argument and bell inequalities . </S>",
    "<S> mermin @xcite has also considered a physical system made of many particles with spins , assuming that the initial state is a so called ghz state @xcite ; another many - particle quantum state has been studied by drummond @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it turns out that considering a double fock state ( dfs )  with spins , instead of these states , sheds interesting new light on the einstein - bohr debate .  </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that , in this case , the epr  elements of reality can be macroscopic , for instance the total angular momentum ( or magnetization ) contained in a large region of space ; even if not measured , such macroscopic quantities presumably possess physical reality , which gives even more strength to the epr argument .  </S>",
    "<S> moreover , one can no longer invoke the huge difference of scales between the measured properties and the measurement apparatuses , and bohr s refutation becomes less plausible .    </S>",
    "<S> double fock states with spins also lead to violations of the bell inequalities @xcite , so that they are appropriate for experimental tests of quantum violations of local realism .  </S>",
    "<S> a difficulty , nevertheless , is that the violations require that all @xmath1 spins be measured in @xmath1 different regions of space , which may be very difficult experimentally if @xmath1 exceeds @xmath2 or @xmath3 ; with present experimental techniques , the schemes discussed in @xcite are therefore probably more thought experiments than realistic possibilities . </S>",
    "<S> here we come closer to experiments by studying schemes involving only individual position measurement of the particles , without any necessity of accurate localization .    with bose condensed gases of metastable helium atoms , micro - channel plates </S>",
    "<S> indeed allow one to detect atoms one by one @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> the first idea that then comes to mind is to consider the interference pattern created by a dfs , a situation that has been investigated theoretically by several authors @xcite , and observed experimentally @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> the quantum effects occurring in the detection of the fringes have been studied in @xcite , in particular the quantum fluctuations of the fringe amplitude ; see also @xcite for a discussion of fringes observed with three condensates , in correlation with populations oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> but , for obtaining quantum violations of bell type inequalities , continuous position measurements are not necessarily optimal ; it is more natural to consider measurement apparatuses with a dichotomic result , such as interferometers with two outputs , as in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , laser atomic fluorescence may be used to determine at which output of an interferometer atoms are found , without requiring a very accurate localization of their position ; in fact , since this measurement process has a small effect on the measured quantity ( the position of the atom in one of the arms ) , one obtains in this way a quantum non - demolition scheme where many fluorescence cycles can be used to ensure good efficiency .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum effects taking place in measurements performed with interferometers with 2 input and 2 output ports ( mach - zhender interferometers ) have been studied by several authors ; refs @xcite discuss the effect of quantum noise on an accurate measurement of phase , and compare the feeding of interferometers with various quantum states ; refs @xcite give a detailed treatment of the heisenberg limit as well as of the role of the fisher information and of the cramer - rao lower bound in this problem .  </S>",
    "<S> but , to our knowledge , none of these studies leads to violations of bell inequalities and local realism .  here </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider interferometers with 4 input ports and 4 output ports , in which a dfs is used to feed two of the inputs ( the others receive vacuum ) , and 4 detectors count the particles at the 4 output ports - see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ; we will also consider a similar 6 input-6 output case .  </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen as a generalization of the work described by yurke and stoler in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and also to some extent of the rarity - tapster experiment @xcite ( even if , in that case , the two photons were not emitted by independent sources ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another aspect of the present work is to address the question raised long ago by anderson @xcite in the context of a thought experiment and , more recently , by leggett and sols @xcite : do superfluids that have never seen each other have a well - defined relative phase ? .  </S>",
    "<S> a positive answer occurs in the usual view : when spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place at the bose- einstein transition , each condensate acquires a well - defined phase , though with a completely random value .  </S>",
    "<S> however , in quantum mechanics , the bose - einstein condensates of superfluids are naturally described by fock states , for which the phase of the system is completely undetermined , in contradiction with this view . nevertheless , the authors of refs . @xcite and </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have shown how repeated quantum measurements of the relative phase of two fock states make a well - defined value emerge spontaneously , with a random value . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to remove the contradiction ; considering that the relative phase appears under the effect of spontaneous symmetry breaking , as soon as the bec s are formed , or later , under the effect of measurements , then appears as a matter of personal preference .    but </S>",
    "<S> a closer examination of the problem shows that this is not always true @xcite : situations do exist where the two points of view are not equivalent , and where the predictions of quantum mechanics for an ensemble of measurements are at variance with those obtained from a classical average over a phase .  </S>",
    "<S> this is not so surprising after all : the idea of a pre - existing phase is very similar to the notion of  an epr  element of reality  - for a double fock state , the relative phase is nothing but what is often called a hidden variable .  </S>",
    "<S> the tools offered by the bell theorem are therefore appropriate to exhibit contradictions between the notion of a pre  existing phase and the predictions of quantum mechanics .  indeed </S>",
    "<S> , we will obtain violations of the bchsh inequalities @xcite , new ghz contradictions @xcite as well as hardy impossibilities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fock - state condensates appear as remarkably versatile , able to create violations that usually require elaborate entangled wave functions , and produce new @xmath1-body violations .    </S>",
    "<S> a preliminary short version of this work has been published in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present article gives more details and focusses on some issues that will inevitably appear in the planning of an experiment , such as the effect of non - perfect detection efficiency , losses , or the geometry of the wavefronts in the region of the detectors .  </S>",
    "<S> in   [ quantum ] we basically use the same method as in @xcite ( unitary transformations of creation operators ) , following refs @xcite and @xcite , but include the treatment of losses ; in   [ more elaborate ] , we develop a more elaborate theory of many - particle detection and high order correlation signals , performing a calculation in @xmath4 configuration space , and including a treatment of the geometrical effects of wavefronts in the detection regions ( this section may be skipped by the reader who is not interested in experimental considerations ) ; finally ,   [ epr ] applies these calculations to three situations : bchsh inequality violations with two sources , ghz contradictions with three sources , and hardy contradictions . </S>",
