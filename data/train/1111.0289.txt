    "starburst driven outflows are composed of multi - phase gas . a tenuous , hot ( @xmath17 k ) plasma created by stellar winds and supernovae ejecta is thought to carry most of the energy and metals in the outflow @xcite while neutral and molecular interstellar gas clouds entrained in the hot outflow contribute the majority of the mass @xcite .",
    "optical emission lines are thought to be produced by turbulent mixing layers on the surface of the cool entrained clouds as well as by diffuse ( @xmath18 k ) ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the fate of the ejected multi - phase gas is likely to depend on the galaxy mass as well as environment .",

    "hot gas winds from galaxies in groups and clusters may be confined by the dense intergalactic gas in these systems @xcite or stripped away by it @xcite .",
    "gas which is stripped will enrich the intergalactic medium with metals and entropy @xcite .",
    "most galaxies in the local universe are in groups @xcite and groups are the building blocks of galaxy clusters .",
