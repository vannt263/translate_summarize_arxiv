    "preemptive priority queueing system could be meaningful , sometimes even vital in real life , such as at bank counters or in the emergency room .",
    "miller @xcite identified a special structure on the rate matrix , and suggested an efficient computational scheme for @xmath0 priority queue .",
    "since then , the priority queueing systems have drew a lot of interests , and many researchers have been working hard on different topics of preemptive queues , for example , gail , hantler and taylor @xcite , kao and narayanan @xcite , takine @xcite , alfa @xcite , isotupa and stanford @xcite , alfa , liu and he @xcite , drekic and woolford @xcite , zhao et al .",
    "@xcite and so on .",
    "while the stationary distribution is very important for a queueing model to characterize its performance , in most cases , it is difficult to obtain an explicit expression of the stationary distribution .",
    "this motivates the study of exact tail asymptotic behavior of the stationary distribution because the property of the exact tail asymptotics often leads to the performance bounds , approximations and other properties of the queueing model . in recent years",
    ", many new results on exact tail asymptotics for the continuous - time models have been established , including that li and zhao @xcite obtained the tail asymptotic results for the classical continuous - time preemptive priority queueing model . however ,",
    "in contrast to the extensive studies of tail asymptotics for the continuous - time queueing systems , there has been yet little systematic investigation on the exact tail asymptotics for the discrete - time queueing systems .",
    "the main reason is that , in a discrete - time queueing system , all queueing activities ( e.g. arrivals and departures ) could occur simultaneously , which results in high complexity and difficulty of the analysis .",
    "considering the importance of the discrete - time queueing systems in both theory and practice , it is interesting and important to study the tail asymptotic behaviors for those discrete - time models .",
    "recently , xue and alfa @xcite discussed a discrete - time priority @xmath1 queue , and obtained the exact tail asymptotics in the marginal distribution for the low - priority queue .",
    "we also note that xu @xcite extended the continuous - time model studied in li and zhao @xcite to a special kind of discrete - time model , and studied the tail asymptotics for this special model .",
    "inspired by the above works , in this paper , we will generalize the model in li and zhao @xcite to a more general discrete - time model , i.e. , the discrete - time preemptive priority queue with single server and two types of customers , and study its tail asymptotic properties .",
    "we will carry out the analysis through the kernel method , the details of which could be found in fayolle , iasnogorodski and malyshev @xcite , li and zhao @xcite , li , tavakoli and zhao @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 provides the model description and the fundamental form .",
    "discussions about the fundamental form and the kernel equation are presented in section 3 , where the expressions of the generating functions are also obtained . in section 4 , the singularity analysis and the tauberian - like theorem used to determine the tail asymptotics are provided .",
    "sections 5 and 6 give the details about proofs of exact tail asymptotics along both queue directions .",
    "as mentioned , we focus on the discrete - time preemptive priority queue with two classes of customers , one with high - priority and the other with low - priority . both types of customers arrive independently according to two bernoulli processes with probabilities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and their service times follow geometrical distributions with parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the service rule is first in , first out ( fifo ) for both classes . with the preemptive rule ,",
    "the service of a low - priority customer is interrupted upon the arrival of a high - priority customer .",
    "the interrupted low - priority customer will stay at the head of the waiting line to restart its service immediately after the last high - priority customer in the system completes its service .",
    "all processes are mutually independent .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be the number of high- and low - priority customers in the system at the time slot division point @xmath8 , including the one being served , respectively , then we develop a discrete - time markov chain @xmath9 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath10 .",
    "denote @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for any real number @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "one can easily get that the system is stable if @xmath15 , which also implies @xmath16 and @xmath17 . under this condition , for any @xmath18 , let @xmath19 be the joint stationary distribution of the number of high- and low - priority customers in the system .",
    "we also use the following convention : for two functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 of nonnegative integers , @xmath22 means that @xmath23 .",
    "different from the continuous - time queueing system , all queueing activities such as the customers potential arrival and departure in a discrete - time queueing system could occur at the same time , so for mathematical clarity , we consider an early arrival system ( eas ) ( see @xcite ) in this paper .",
