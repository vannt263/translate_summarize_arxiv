    "in this paper , we present a numerical method for solving scattering problems from locally perturbed periodic surfaces . scattering problems for periodic or quasiperiodic incident fields from periodic structures",
    "have been well studied over at least 25 years .",
    "the common way of solving is reduction to one periodicity cell , which avoids the need for computing numerical solutions in unbounded domains .",
    "however , if such reduction fails due to non - periodicity of the incident field or the surface , one needs to seek for new approaches .",
    "the approach we present in this paper is based on the floquet - bloch transform .",
    "it builds up a relationship between a non - periodic problem and a family of quasiperiodic problems reduced to one single period . with this transform ,",
    "the scattering problems from periodic surfaces and non - periodic incident fields have been discussed in @xcite and @xcite . based on these theoretic results",
    ", a numerical scheme has been developed to solve these kinds of scattering problems in  @xcite . following this type of technique ,",
    "we introduce in this paper an algorithm for solving scattering problems from local perturbations of periodic surfaces that is pretty close to the one from the recent paper  @xcite .",
    "our convergence analysis is for various reasons different , as  @xcite for instance strongly relies on integral equations in the spatial variable .",
    "the source of inspiration for all these techniques seems to be the paper  @xcite on wave propagation in full - space periodic media .    to briefly present our numerical approach in some detail",
    ", we firstly rely on the floquet - bloch transform , defined on functions living in periodic domains , and hence reformulate the locally perturbed problem by a suitable diffeomorphism between the locally perturbed and the purely periodic domain . applying the bloch transform to the new problem",
    "yields a family of quasiperiodic scattering problems posed in one single periodicity cell .",
    "we state the classic error analysis for finite element discretizations using low - order approximation in @xmath0 . the interesting feature of this discretization is that all integrals in the quasiperiodicity parameters can be computed by hand , such that standard solvers become attractive to tackle the full problem . by finite element discretizations for the spatial parts of the problem and , roughly , the trapezoidal rule discretizing the inverse bloch transform , one gets a large but sparse block - linear system to solve . to this end",
    ", we use the gmres iteration with a specially designed incomplete @xmath1-decomposition as pre - conditioner for the numerical solution of the linear system .    for dirichlet scattering problems on perturbed periodic surfaces one can , at least in two dimensions , of course exploit the corresponding numerical convergence theory for boundary integral equation approximations from rough surface scattering theory , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , few methods specifically designed for such locally perturbed periodic scatterers . in @xcite and @xcite , the authors give a method that approximates the dirichlet - to - neumann map on the transparent edges of a periodic waveguide modeled by the helmholtz equation .",
    "another method that uses the so - called recursive doubling procedure constructs the sommerfeld - to sommerfeld maps at artificial boundaries of such a waveguide , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both of these methods are motivated by the infinite half - guide and inspired by the limiting absorption principle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ se : scatter ] , we describe the direct scattering problem corresponding to a locally perturbed periodic surface . in sections  [",
    "se : persca ] and  [ se : qpscattperturb ] , we use the bloch transform to obtain an equivalent family of quasiperiodic problems . in section  [ se : invbloch ] we give a discrete inverse bloch transform and estimate the finite element method applied to the individual quasiperiodic scattering problems .",
    "the numerical implementation for the bloch transform based method is illustrated in section  [ se : nummet ] . in the last section  [ se : numeg ] ,",
