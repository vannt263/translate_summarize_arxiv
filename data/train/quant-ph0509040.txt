    "photons are among the main carriers of information .",
    "this information can be encoded in their energy , linear momentum , and polarization state . in recent years , another degree of freedom for photons has been recognized : their _ orbital angular momentum _ ( oam ) . in 1992",
    "allen and coworkers  @xcite showed that optical paraxial cylindrical beams having an azimuthal phase dependence of the form @xmath0 carry a discrete oam of @xmath1 units per photon along their propagation direction .",
    "this angular momentum produces a mechanical effect ( induces a torque ) when suitable light patterns interact with matter ; it can be transferred from spatial beams containing phase dislocations on their axis ( e.g. optical vortices ) to suitable trapped microscopic particles in optical tweezers  @xcite .    at the quantum level",
    ", considerable interest has been brought for quantum information processing exploiting single and entangled photons prepared in a superposition of states bearing a well defined oam  @xcite .",
    "indeed , one of their main distinguishing features is that , at variance with two - level quantum states , or qubits , oam photon eigenstates involve the more general case of @xmath2-level ( @xmath3 ) quantum states or qudits .",
    "such a generalization to multidimensional states allows to extend quantum coding alphabets without the need to increase the number of entangled photons , providing also a more secure quantum cryptography .",
    "since fewer photons are needed , the multidimensional approach reduces the decoherence associated to many photon entanglement .",
    "moreover , an striking consequence of such a higher dimensional encoding is that violation of local realism for two maximally entangled qudits is stronger than for two maximally entangled qubits , and increases with @xmath2  @xcite . for quantum computation applications",
    ", oam photon eigenstates could even enable to optimize certain quantum computing architectures , where a compromise between the number of required qubit and qudit states exists  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a general quantization scheme of field operators in both the nonparaxial and paraxial regimes of light propagation . within the nonparaxial regime ,",
    "the obtained operators posses the suitable phase structure that will straightforwardly allow to proceed , at a later stage , to paraxial field operators . in this regime ,",
    "the field operators can conveniently be expressed in terms of eigenstate modes of the paraxial orbital and spin angular momentum operators .",
    "our approach is further extended to the optical phase space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii reexamines the problem of the separation of the angular momentum of a classical electromagnetic field into orbital and spin angular momentum components and provides a general approach as to whether such a decomposition is physically meaningful .",
    "iii adapts the previous approach into the field quantization formalism .",
    "section iv presents a powerful scheme , based on the wigner representation , to describe geometric transformations of photons prepared in states bearing oam .",
    "conclusions of the paper are drawn in section v.",
    "energy , linear momentum and angular momentum constitute the key physical quantities that characterize the electromagnetic field configurations .",
    "first of all , they are constants of motion . their conservation can be cast as a continuity equation relating a density and a flux ( tensor ) density , or current , associated to the conserved quantity .",
    "the total free electromagnetic angular momentum @xmath4 in a given volume @xmath5 with respect to a point @xmath6 is defined by  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the position vector , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the electric and magnetic fields , and @xmath11 denotes the total linear momentum of the free electromagnetic field .",
    "we shall focus our study on @xmath12 .",
    "notice that @xmath13 is defined in an analogous manner as the angular momentum of a system of massive particles .",
    "it can be expressed as the integral of an angular momentum density which is equal to the cross product of @xmath8 with the linear momentum density @xmath14 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath13 is guaranteed if the flux of angular momentum through the surface @xmath15 enclosing @xmath5 vanishes ( e.g. for fields that decay sufficiently fast when @xmath5 becomes large ) .",
    "this is reflected by the integral form of the continuity equation for the @xmath16-component of the angular momentum  @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 $ ] is the angular momentum flux tensor  , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and repeated indices are summed over all these three components .",
    "we also employ the usual kronecker delta @xmath22 and the levi - civita tensor @xmath23 , which takes the value @xmath24 if @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the value @xmath28 if @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and is zero otherwise . ] .",
    "it is well known that in classical mechanics the total angular momentum of a system of point matter particles can be separated into two contributions .",
    "a first one describes the angular momentum associated with the center of mass motion of the whole system , while the second one refers to the relative angular momentum of the constituent particles with respect to the total center of mass .",
    "the center of mass contribution is thus dependent on the choice of the reference frame , whereas the relative part is independent .",
    "both quantities obey independent evolution equations . in quantum mechanics",
    ", in addition to these two contributions ( which one could consider as giving rise to a purely orbital angular momentum ) , there is an intrinsic or spin angular momentum ( independent of the choice of a reference frame ) with no classical analog for point particles .",
    "now , the situation for the free electromagnetic field is more subtle . a similar separation of @xmath13 into _ strict _ orbital and spin angular momentum vectors",
    "is known to be impossible because no reference frame exist for the photon in which it is at rest  @xcite .",
    "it is however feasible to decompose @xmath13 into two observables  @xcite , whose physical meaning will be provided below , as @xmath32 with @xmath33 where the symbol @xmath34 denotes the transverse component of the fields ( recall that transverse components of any field @xmath35 satisfy @xmath36 ) . since @xmath37 and @xmath38 involve the transverse part of the vector potential @xmath39 , they are gauge invariant .",
    "notice that , at variance with @xmath37 , @xmath38 is independent of the definition of the origin of the coordinate system . as it occurs for @xmath13",

    "our framework is completely general , thus allowing to envisage the proper quantization of the fields at a later stage .",

    "( [ eq : wigner ] ) . to this end , we invoke two remarkable properties : ( i ) on account of the stone - von neumann theorem , unitary operators whose generators are quadratic in @xmath181 [ such as @xmath191 induce linear canonical transformations , @xmath192 , in the optical phase space ; ( ii ) under the action of @xmath193 the wigner function experiences a simple point transformation @xmath194  @xcite . in our case , the linear canonical transformation generated by the quadratic operators  ( [ eq : ls ] ) results from the relation @xmath195 , and reads as @xmath196 where @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 ( recall that @xmath201 is the rayleigh range and @xmath202 the mode width at @xmath81 ) .",

    "the key point is thus to observe that owing to the unitary relation ( [ eq : oamstates ] ) between states belonging to the same sphere @xmath151 , knowledge of the wigner function of _ any _ given state on @xmath151 allows one to determine the wigner function of all states on that same sphere .",

    "moreover , the oam carried by states @xmath225 follows immediately from eq .",

    "it is the projection of the unit vector @xmath241 corresponding to @xmath149 along the vertical axis of @xmath151 .",
    "hence , arbitrary states on any sphere bear fractional oam in units of @xmath93 .",
    "the limiting cases , being represented by lg and hermite - gaussian states , have the well known @xmath1 and zero values , respectively  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a detailed description of classical optical beams and single photon states bearing oam .",
    "our quantum field theory formalism generalizes previous studies on this subject and , via phase space methods , highlights the inherent symmetries of unitarily related families of paraxial spatial modes , of which , those carrying integer oam ( in units of @xmath93 ) constitute one particular subset .",
    "the @xmath168-th order orbital poincar sphere representation enables to visualize mode transformations .",
    "these transformations correspond to first - order optical systems with symplectic ray - transfer matrix @xmath193 [ given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : t ] ) ] and evidence that it is possible to manipulate single photons prepared in superpositions of oam states , and , thus , implement single qubit gates ( which correspond to particular rotations on the poincar sphere ) .",
    "combination of these gates with two - photon quantum gates exploiting oam entangled states generated from parametric down conversion  @xcite constitutes a realistic and a fascinating possibility towards quantum computation with linear optical networks  @xcite .",
    "one could also exploit the multidimensional hilbert structure of oam photon states for quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocols . at variance with qkd schemes employing polarization states , which only allow transmission of one key bit per photon and require the reference frames of the sender and receiver to be aligned with each other  @xcite , oam photon states are invariant under rotations along their propagation direction .",
    "the continuous reference frame alignment monitorization for polarization states may not seem to strong of a restriction for ground - based stations , but it could be an important limitation on a moving station such as a satellite .",
    "the distortions created by atmospheric turbulence on oam photon states could be corrected using two - dimensional filtering techniques that have been proposed for image recovering ( adaptive optics ) under various degradation mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we also wish to point out that detection of phenomena related to highly energetic photons  @xcite ( @xmath242-rays and gamma - rays ) carrying oam could be of interest for astrophysical measurements of distant cosmic entities ( pulsars , quasars , black holes ) through compton scattering experiments .",
