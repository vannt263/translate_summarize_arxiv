    "bell showed the inconsistency of local realism with quantum mechanics , by deriving a constraint on the correlations predicted by any local hidden variable ( lhv ) theory @xcite .",
    "for some quantum states , these constraints , called bell inequalities , are violated .",
    "bell s discovery of quantum nonlocality has inspired countless investigations @xcite and , through the close connection with entanglement @xcite , underpins the field of quantum information .",
    "a major challenge is to understand the interplay of bell s nonlocality with loss , which is defined by the ratio , @xmath9 , of the number of detected to emitted particles .",
    "loss caused by detector inefficiencies has resulted in the famous `` detection loophole '' for testing bell s correlations in the laboratory @xcite . to date , there has been no loophole - free violation of a bell inequality for spacelike separated measurement events .",
    "furthermore , the sensitivity of loophole - free bell nonlocality to transmission losses is intimately related to the security of quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "motivated by all this , there has been a considerable effort to work out the smallest value of @xmath9 required for a loophole - free violation of a bell inequality .",
    "bell s original gedanken experiment involved measurement of the spin correlations of two maximally entangled and spatially separated spin-@xmath10 particles .",
    "his inequality , and the equally famous version derived by clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) , required only two measurement settings , for each particle @xcite . despite the importance of this inequality and its @xmath0-particle generalisations , the mermin - ardehali - belinski - klyshko ( mabk ) inequalities @xcite ,",
    "surprisingly little is known about how to achieve a violation of them , for reduced efficiencies , @xmath9 .",
    "where there are only two spatially separated particles ( @xmath11 ) , garg and mermin put forward a modified chsh inequality that could be violated for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "their inequality removed the necessity of heralding the emission events , since the inequality did not specify the total number of undetected particle pairs .",
    "eberhard showed that the clauser - horne ( ch ) inequality @xcite would yield violations for as low as @xmath13 using non - maximally entangled states , also without the need for heralding @xcite . where measurements are made on @xmath0 spin-@xmath10 systems , at each of @xmath0 sites , larsson and semitecolos ( ls ) proved that for ch - type inequalities , @xmath14 was sufficient , at least for some quantum state .",
    "they concluded `` there are @xmath0- site experiments for which the quantum mechanical predictions violate local realism whenever @xmath15 '' @xcite . despite this knowledge",
    ", it remained unclear how to demonstrate this nonlocality , as no specific inequality and state was proposed that would enable realisation of bell s nonlocality for efficiencies @xmath9 as low as @xmath7 for each detector .",
    "an explicit loophole - free demonstration of bell nonlocality using the mabk inequalities and the maximally entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite was shown possible , with heralding , for @xmath16 @xcite . however , the lowest threshold here requires @xmath17 .",
    "cabello , rodriguez and villanueva ( crv ) established that the ls limit is achievable , for large @xmath0 and for the ghz states , by proving that @xmath18 was necessary and sufficient for bell nonlocality in the case of @xmath0 odd . however , no inequality was proposed @xcite .",
    "firm proposals have been given however for efficiencies as low as @xmath19 at _ one _ detector , but only for non - maximally entangled states and provided an atom could be detected with 100% efficiency at a second site @xcite .    in this paper , we contribute further to these results , by constructing a tighter version of the mabk inequalities . insight is gained from the recent work of cavalcanti et al and acin et al @xcite who derived a `` holder '' bell inequality that allows realisation of the ls - crv efficiency threshold of near @xmath20 for high @xmath0 .",
    "we will see that the tight mabk inequality is in fact a melding of the new holder inequality ( which dominates at lower efficiencies ) and the old mabk inequality ( which dominates at high efficiencies ) .    in this way",
    ", we show it possible to violate a two - setting bell inequality loophole - free , using a maximally entangled ghz state , whenever @xmath4 , for @xmath21 . here",
    ", @xmath2 is the efficiency at site @xmath3 . for symmetric sites , the threshold efficiency reduces to @xmath19 as @xmath6 , as given in ref . @xcite . in fact , as we confirm in this paper , @xmath19 is the best result possible , since we reason that @xmath22 is required to demonstrate bell s nonlocality using @xmath23-setting inequalities .",
    "furthermore , we establish that where @xmath8 , the loophole - free violation of the two - setting bell inequality does not require @xmath24 for each site @xmath3 , but can be achieved even if the efficiencies are very low at some sites . *",
    "_ _ * * *    we conclude with a brief discussion , pointing out that three or more sites are required if one is to obtain the violations of the two - setting inequalities in the lossy scenarios .",
    "we then conjecture whether these violations can signify a genuine multi - partite bell nonlocality , in the sense defined by svetlichny and collins et al @xcite .",
    "let us begin by presenting the bell inequalities derived by cavalcanti , foster , reid and drummond ( cfrd ) @xcite .",
    "we define a set of space - like separated measurements @xmath25 that can be performed on each of @xmath3 systems ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we consider only two settings , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , at each site , and so denote @xmath29 and @xmath30 . for any lhv theory ,",
    "it is true that @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the outcomes for the measurements @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the left side of the inequality is written in a compact form and involves moments of the hermitian observables @xmath34 and @xmath35 defined at each site .",
    "violation of this inequality will imply failure of lhv theories , and hence bell s nonlocality .",
    "the inequality ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) and its variants are closely associated with the holder inequalities used in mathematical analysis @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the inequalities based on ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) will be referred to throughout this paper as the `` holder bell inequalities '' .",
    "the best known mathematical holder inequality is the cauchy schwarz inequality .",
    "the distinctive feature for our purposes is that the upper bound given by the right - side of a holder inequality is moment - dependent .",
    "this will give an advantage for detecting bell s nonlocality in lossy scenarios .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite have derived the application of the inequality ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) to the scenario of @xmath0 spin-@xmath10 systems , as in the original bell and ghz gedanken experiments @xcite . here",
    ", one assigns @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the pauli spin operators for site @xmath3 , and @xmath38 can be different for each site .",
    "since the outcomes of the measurement are always @xmath39 or @xmath40 , the inequality ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) will reduce to @xcite @xmath41 when the combination of moments given by the left side of the inequality exceeds @xmath42 , one can claim failure of lhv models .    supposing there is inefficient detection , we follow bell s analysis @xcite and note that for each emission event , the `` spin '' measurement made on each particle will have three possible outcomes , depending on whether the spin is measured `` up '' , `` down '' , or if there is `` no detection '' .",
    "the three outcomes are assigned the numerical result @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "that is , each @xmath32 and @xmath33 can now have values @xmath44 or @xmath43 . then",
    ", we note that the inequality deduced from ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) changes . while the inequality ( [ eq : mermin-4 ] ) is still valid , it is too restrictive .",
    "the moments of the right - side are no longer necessarily given by @xmath42 as in the perfect efficiency case of ( [ eq : mermin-4 ] ) , but can be measured , and compared with those of the left - side , to give a more sensitive test for failure of lhv theories .    in practice , assuming a detection efficiency @xmath2 for both measurements ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) at site @xmath3 , the right - side of the inequality ( [ eq : mermin-4 ] ) is predicted to be @xmath45 .",
    "the inequality reduces to @xmath46 this gives us the desired result , that the bell inequality has a lhv bound ( given by the right - side ) that reduces with efficiency @xmath2 .",
    "next , we establish the connection with the well - known mabk bell inequalities , by noting there are two different forms of the holder bell inequalities ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) and ( [ eq : mermin-4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath47 , then it is always true that @xmath48 , where @xmath49 are real numbers .",
    "thus , on separating @xmath50 into real and imaginary parts ( denoted by symbols @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , the holder bell inequality ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) implies the bell inequality @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 ) . using the reasoning explained above",
    ", this inequality reduces to @xmath55 @xmath56 for the lossy experiment , which gives a useful version of the inequality ( [ eq : mermin-4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath55the inequalities ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : ardloss ] ) have the same left - side as the subset of mabk inequalities called the ardehali inequalities @xcite , and we have therefore denoted the left - side by the symbol @xmath57 .    also , following directly from ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) , because for any complex number @xmath58 it is true that @xmath59 , it follows that for any lhv model @xmath60 where we can select @xmath61 to be either of @xmath62 or @xmath55@xmath63 . in the presence of losses , the inequality ( [ eq : merhold ] ) becomes @xmath64 which gives a second useful version of the inequality ( [ eq : mermin-4 - 1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath55 in this case , the inequalities have the same left - side as the subset of mabk inequalities derived by mermin @xcite , and we have therefore denoted the left - side by the symbol @xmath61 .",
    "the bell inequalities ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : merhold ] ) were derived , from a different perspective , by cavalcanti et al @xcite .",
    "we will show below that while the two holder bell inequalities given by ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : merhold ] ) have the same left - side as the mabk bell inequalities , the right - side is different .",
    "the left - side of the holder bell inequalities ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : merhold ] ) corresponds precisely to that used in the well known bell inequalities of mabk @xcite .",
    "we now present the mabk bell inequalities . in the mabk case , a different bound",
    "is obtained for the lhv prediction . when @xmath65 , this bound is clearly tighter than that derived for the holder inequalities .",
    "the mabk inequalities consist of two subsets , one for even @xmath0 and one for odd @xmath0 .",
    "the well - known `` ardehali '' mabk bell inequality applies only to even @xmath0 , and is @xcite @xmath66 when @xmath11 , the left side becomes @xmath67 and ardehali s inequality reduces to the well - known chsh inequality , @xmath68 . for the case of @xmath0 odd , only , mermin proved the bell inequality @xcite @xmath69 combined , the two inequalities ( [ eq : mabkard ] ) and ( [ eq : mermin-3 ] ) give a lhv prediction for arbitrary @xmath0 , and are commonly termed the `` mabk inequalities '' @xcite .    the ardehali and mermin bell inequalities are also valid for the lossy scenario , where `` no detection '' outcomes are assigned the outcome `` @xmath43 '' @xcite",
    ". however , we can see immediately on comparison with the holder bell inequalities ( [ eq : ardloss ] ) and ( [ eq : merloss ] ) that , for the lossy experiment , the mabk inequalities can no longer be tight .",
    "a similar result is known for these inequalities even in the context of pure states : mabk inequalities do not detect the bell nonlocality that has been shown to exist for nonmaximally entangled generalised ghz states @xcite .",
    "now , we examine the predictions given by the maximally entangled ghz state @xmath70 , where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the eigenstates of the pauli spin observable @xmath73 , mermin showed that if we choose measurement settings to correspond to either @xmath55@xmath74 or @xmath75 for each @xmath76 , then for optimally chosen settings , the quantum prediction is @xmath77 , for @xmath0 odd @xcite . for the ardehali",
    "s inequalities , the optimal measurement choice involves a @xmath55@xmath74 or @xmath75 setting for @xmath78 sites , with a rotated setting for the @xmath0th site @xcite .",
    "then , the optimal quantum prediction is @xmath79 , for @xmath0 even . assuming symmetric detector efficiencies @xmath80 ,",
    "the optimal quantum prediction in the lossy case will be @xmath81 , @xmath82 ( for odd @xmath0 ) , and @xmath83 ( for @xmath0even ) . using the mabk bell inequalities directly ,",
    "this gives the efficiency threshold @xmath16 for all @xmath0 , which reduces to a lowest value of @xmath84 as @xmath6 , as shown by braunstein and mann @xcite .    as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the holder bell inequalities ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : merhold ] ) will give a lower efficiency threshold in the symmetric case , for all @xmath8 . if we consider odd @xmath0 , then we use the inequality ( [ eq : merhold ] ) , for which the right - side is predicted to be @xmath85 ( corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : merloss ] ) ) . for even @xmath0",
    ", we use the inequality ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) for which the right - side is @xmath86 ( corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ardloss ] ) ) .",
    "the associated threshold efficiency for violation of the holder - bell inequalities is given by @xmath87 for all @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this threshold reduces to @xmath88 for @xmath89 , and approaches @xmath7 as @xmath6 .",
    "having confirmed that neither the mabk nor the holder bell inequalities can provide the tight lhv bound in the presence of loss ( poor detection efficiencies ) , our objective is to gain insight into the _ actual _ lhv predictions , and to then determine if lower efficiency thresholds are possible for a given @xmath0 .    for all lhv theories ,",
    "it is true that @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the expectation value for the product of outcomes @xmath92 of simultaneous measurements @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) performed on the @xmath0 spatially separated systems . here , @xmath93 symbolises the set of local hidden variables of the lhv theory .",
    "thus , @xmath94 is the expectation value of @xmath92 given the hidden variable specification @xmath93 , and @xmath95 is the underlying probability distribution for @xmath93 .",
    "we consider the lhv prediction for the terms @xmath96 , @xmath61 , @xmath57 of the chsh , mermin and ardehali inequalities .",
    "we also introduce @xmath97 as a measure of overall efficiency . specifically : @xmath98 where the outcomes of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by @xmath39 , @xmath40 or @xmath43 ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the right side of the holder inequalities ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) and ( [ eq : merhold ] ) .",
    "in fact , there are @xmath101 relevant efficiencies @xmath9 , one for each measurement setting ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) at each site @xmath3 . where the efficiencies are equal for the two settings , and given at site @xmath3 by @xmath2 , the quantum prediction for ( [ eq : wset ] ) is @xmath102 .",
    "a complication is that to measure the actual values of @xmath96 , @xmath61 , @xmath57 and @xmath97 , it is necessary to establish all emission events , using an `` event ready '' or `` heralding '' apparatus @xcite .",
    "this is a significant but not insurmountable challenge @xcite .",
    "it is possible to show that for any lhv model @xcite @xmath103 similar expressions exist for @xmath104 and @xmath105 . here ,",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , @xmath109 are the expectation values for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , given the hidden variable specification @xmath93 .",
    "similar expansions can be given for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "we find that for any lhv theory , constraints exist for the possible values of @xmath113 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , given the value of @xmath114 .",
    "in other words , for any given experimentally measured value of @xmath97 , there will be a constraint on the lhv predictions for @xmath113 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "we determine these constraints as follows .",
    "the outcome @xmath32 is constrained to be one of @xmath44 or @xmath43 .",
    "thus , in the lhv model , it must be true that @xmath115 .",
    "the lhv model will specify probabilities for the @xmath39 and @xmath40 outcome for @xmath32 , for a given hidden variable specification @xmath93 .",
    "we denote these probabilities by @xmath55@xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "then we see that @xmath118 whereas @xmath119 .",
    "we note @xmath120 is in fact the efficiency value predicted for the measurement setting @xmath32 , given the hidden variable specification @xmath93 , and we introduce the notation @xmath121 .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath122 , it follows that @xmath123 and similarly @xmath124 we evaluate for each possible @xmath125 , @xmath126 , the possible values of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which is a simple numeric exercise . for a given @xmath128 , the possible values of @xmath127 can be displayed as a scattering of points on a diagram .",
    "we can then sample again over all possible distributions @xmath95 to evaluate the consistent predictions for both @xmath129 and @xmath96 , for any possible lhv theory distribution .",
    "the same procedure is performed , to evaluate the possible @xmath61 and @xmath130 , for a given @xmath97 .",
    "in fact , the full sampling is a tedious task . for our purposes , because we have two analytical bounds on the lhv predictions , we sample lhv predictions only to verify the bounds , and to establish the degree of tightness of them .",
    "our sampling involves evaluating the possible @xmath96 , @xmath57 or @xmath61 , and @xmath97 when hidden variables assume the extreme values of @xmath44 , or the value @xmath43 , which in the absence of loss would amount to assuming a deterministic lhv theory @xcite .",
    "this does not cover all stochastic lhv theories , but we will see is enough to establish the validity and degree of tightness of the analytical mabk and holder limits , for a given @xmath97 .",
    "before analysing the results , we give a geometrical interpretation of the degree of tightness of the holder and mabk bell inequalities .",
    "the derivation of the mabk inequalities utilises that the local hidden variable expectation values @xmath108 , @xmath109 are each constrained to the domain @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the mabk bell inequality is thus defined by the polytope formed from the @xmath132- dimensional polytope , that is a square @xmath133 centred at the origin , with sides of length @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "the holder inequality ( [ eq : bellcfrd ] ) on the other hand is derived using that for the local hidden variables , it is always true that @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and hence that @xmath136 these constraints follow from the lhv assumption of a non - negative variance for hidden variable distributions @xcite . for the case of perfect efficiency ( corresponding to @xmath137 )",
    ", this latter inequality reduces to @xmath138 ( because the outcomes @xmath32 , @xmath33 are always @xmath44 ) . in the holder derivation",
    "therefore , the values for the local hidden variables are assumed constrained on or within a circle @xmath139 centred at the origin of radius @xmath140 , which _ encloses _ the mabk square @xmath133 . clearly , this holder constraint is not as tight as the mabk one , and indeed the holder bell inequalities are not as tight in this perfect efficiency limit .    where the quantity @xmath97 reduces below @xmath141 , however , the right - side of ( [ eq : ineqtightcircle ] ) is reduced .",
    "in fact we have seen from the analysis given in the previous section that for the lhv variables , @xmath142 .",
    "the holder derivation assumes @xmath134 , and hence @xmath143 , and , similarly , that @xmath144 .",
    "these constraints can be written @xmath55@xmath145@xmath146 , which is the geometric constraint that the hidden variable expectation values be on or within the ellipse @xmath147 , centred at the origin and with minor and major radii given by @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "we see that this constraint can become less restrictive than the mabk square @xmath96 , the consequence being that the holder inequalities can become tighter than the mabk ones , for lower efficiencies .",
    "we note the tight lhv bound for the hidden variables is in fact given by the rectangle , defined by ( [ eq : rect1]-[eq : rect2 ] ) , which is enclosed by the ellipse @xmath147 . as a result",
    ", we can not prove that the holder inequalities are tight .",
    "the two bell inequalities , the holder and mabk , apply to all lhv theories , and hence constrain all lhv predictions . there are valid , for any given measurement of @xmath97 , without any additional assumptions .",
    "the mabk inequalities are categorised into two subsets , one for even @xmath0 , and one for odd @xmath0 , and we will do the same for the holder inequalities . using the definition of @xmath97 given by ( [ eq : wset ] ) , we can rewrite the holder inequalities eqs ( [ eq : ardhold ] ) , ( [ eq : merhold ] ) .",
    "the two sets of inequalities are : @xmath150 , @xmath151 for the holder case ; and @xmath152 and @xmath153 for the mabk case ( for even and odd @xmath0 respectively , in each case ) .",

    "it is then possible that an `` eve '' has tapped into alice s channel using a 50:50 beam splitter , and has created a second channel symmetric to alice s .",
    "eve can make measurements on this second channel , simultaneously to alice s measurements .",
    "alice can choose to measure either @xmath170 or @xmath171 , and eve can choose to measure either @xmath172 or @xmath173 . in this case , by symmetry , we deduce that eve s measurements can have the same correlation with the measurements made by bob as alice s measurements",
    ". a similar second eve can exist at bob s channel , at site @xmath174 .",
    "this second eve can make measurements @xmath175 , @xmath176 .",
    "the potential existence of the two eves necessarily downgrades the correlations of alice and bob , measured by @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 , so that the probabilities can not give a violation of the two - setting bell inequality .",
    "this follows , since @xmath170 , @xmath181 , @xmath173 and @xmath176 can be measured simultaneously , and therefore there exists a joint probability distribution for those outcomes .",
    "the set @xmath177 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 can not therefore violate the bell inequality .",
    "the symmetry of the correlations ( @xmath185 , etc ) then allows us to deduce that there can be no violation of the bell inequality for the measurements of alice and bob ( since there exists an underlying probability distribution for these outcomes ) .",
    "the result is readily extended to higher @xmath0 .",
    "the proof depends on the existence of a symmetric beam splitter that creates , from one channel , @xmath132 symmetric channels , to give 50% loss on the first channel .",
    "the proof also utilises that the bell inequality involves just two settings at each site , so that simultaneous measurements performed on two channels at each site can completely specify a joint probability distribution for the bell inequality .",
    "an extension of the argument , assuming existence of a device that creates @xmath23 symmetric channels from @xmath141 channel , would lead to the conclusion that an @xmath23-setting bell inequality can not be violated where @xmath186 .",
    "thus we deduce the requirement of @xmath187 for at least one @xmath3 , for violation of an @xmath23-setting bell inequality@xmath188 .",
    "the region @xmath189 is evident in the figures as that corresponding to a straight - line relationship between actual lhv predictions and @xmath97 .",
    "as expected , the quantum prediction is within the bound set by the lhv predictions .    *",
    "( 3 ) holder region : * the next region is the most interesting to us .",
    "this region shows a different lhv curve , closely approximated by the holder analytic bound .",
    "we call this the `` holder '' region . on examining the figures",
    ", we find that , as @xmath0 increases above @xmath132 , the quantum prediction moves from the mabk region ( @xmath166 ) to intersect the lhv bound in the holder region .",
    "this allows an analytic expression for the threshold efficiency in order to violate the two - setting bell inequality : @xmath190 for @xmath89 and @xmath191 in limit of larger @xmath0 , in the symmetric case @xmath80 .",
    "our analysis thus establishes three new results .",
    "the main result is that the holder expression gives a close fit to the lhv predictions , in this holder region .",
    "this provides an analytical tool for understanding the lhv bounds in the two - setting scenario with loss .",
    "second , we note that the quantum ghz prediction intersects the holder lhv bound , for all @xmath21 even and odd , and moves `` down '' toward the edge of the `` no - violation lhv '' region as @xmath6 .",
    "the third new result is that violation of the two - setting bell inequalities can be obtained without the requirement that _ each _ @xmath2 be greater than 50% ( provided @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is evident from the efficiency threshold ( [ eq : newthres ] ) .",
    "we see that if @xmath78 efficiencies are @xmath141 , we only need an efficiency @xmath192 at the remaining site for a violation of the bell inequality .",
    "this efficiency @xmath193 can be vanishingly small as @xmath6 .",
    "the predicted efficiency thresholds do not quite match those shown to be possible by cabello , rodriguez and villanueva @xcite for the case of odd @xmath0 , but come very close ( for @xmath89 , @xmath88 versus @xmath194 , for @xmath195 @xmath196 versus @xmath197 , for @xmath198 ) .",
    "the difference is that crv imposed an additional symmetric constraint on the lhv model , that each individual @xmath2 is measured and found precisely equal ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this condition is practically reasonable , but is not imposed here .",
    "we have conditioned only on the value of @xmath97 .",
    "our case is informative , however , in revealing low efficiency thresholds in the asymmetric case , without the assumption of symmetric sites , and provides a rigorous way to test bell nonlocality loophole - free , for practical realisations involving asymmetric transmission of entangled qubits .",
    "the efficiency bounds deduced by larsson and semitecolos @xcite are even lower for a specified @xmath0 , but are obtained using clauser - horne inequalities and nonmaximally entangled states . while ch inequalities are useful for loophole - free bell tests @xcite , they rely on rarer joint detection events and thus is usually a less efficient use of the resource , particularly for larger @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "understanding how to test loophole - free bell nonlocality for the mabk situation and for maximally entangled ghz states is therefore an important goal .    on that note ,",
    "it is interesting to conjecture the usefulness of the bell nonlocality that is realised in the two different regions , mabk and holder . for many quantum information tasks , it is the genuine @xmath0-partite form of nonlocality that is the most useful @xcite .",
    "genuine bell nonlocality was considered by svetlichny @xcite , and requires that the bell nonlocality be truly shared among all @xmath0 sites , so that , for example , the system is not describable by the bell nonlocality of a @xmath3-partite ghz state , where @xmath199 .",
    "the best known criterion for genuine bell nonlocality is a violation of the svetlichny inequality @xcite .",
    "this inequality reduces to @xmath200 in our notation , and requires @xmath201 ( @xmath202 for symmetric efficiencies ) for violation , a violation that can only be obtained in the mabk region .",
    "we remark that any more general criterion for genuine bell nonlocality will require , at least , that @xmath24 for each site .",
    "this remark is based on the result that bell nonlocality will always imply a type of nonlocality called `` steering '' @xcite . from this knowledge",
    ", one may utilise results of ref . @xcite to establish the requirement of @xmath24 for each site .",
    "this requirement , however , does not necessarily imply the mabk region , and we leave as an open question whether genuine multipartite bell nonlocality can be observed loophole - free in the holder region .",
    "in summary , we have established that the threshold efficiency for failure of local realism using ghz states and the correlations of the two - setting mabk inequalities is @xmath203 , where @xmath2 is the efficiency at the @xmath0th site .",
    "this means that the maximally entangled ghz state can indeed violate the predictions of lhv models , for symmetric efficiencies @xmath19 as @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for two - setting inequalities , there is no requirement ( for loophole - free bell tests ) that the efficiency @xmath2 at _ each _ site exceed 50% , provided @xmath8 .",
    "the proposed experiment is very simple , and requires a measurement of efficiency only by measurement of the correlation @xmath97 which is readily evaluated from the spin results . while @xmath15 is a challenge for current experiments involving photons , the approach developed here may be extended to multi - setting bell inequalities , for which the fundamental efficiency constraint is lower than @xmath7 .",
    "the inequalities could be useful for detecting bell nonlocality in future heralded experiments involving material particles , where loss is determined to be at a level somewhere between 0.5 and 1 .                      a ekert , phys . rev .",
