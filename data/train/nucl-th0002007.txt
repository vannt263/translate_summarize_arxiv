    "the phonon concept is a useful and simple concept in nuclear structure physics @xcite .",
    "the low - lying collective @xmath10 and @xmath11 excitations in near - spherical nuclei can be considered as quadrupole and octupole vibrations , which represent the most important vibrational degrees of freedom at low energies .",
    "the bosonic phonon concept suggests the occurrence of multiphonon states , which can decay collectively to states with one phonon less by the annihilation of one phonon . in a harmonic picture",
    "@xmath12-phonon states have excitation energies of @xmath12 times the one - phonon energy .",
    "two of the appealing aspects of the study of multiphonon excitations high above the yrast - line is the investigation of their anharmonicities reflecting the influence of the pauli principle and higher order residual interactions as well as the interaction of multiphonon modes with single particle degrees of freedom . certainly these interactions can cause possible fragmentation of the idealized multiphonon modes .",
    "this fragmentation or the eventual observation of almost unfragmented multiphonon states can tell how well the considered phonon is an eigenmode of the nuclear dynamical system . to judge",
    "the deviation from the idealized multiphonon picture in reality obviously needs the formulation of this idealized situation and the investigation in how far the collective picture can account for the data .",
    "multiphonon and two - phonon states are at present a very actively investigated topic in nuclear structure physics . a two - quadrupole - phonon ( @xmath13 ) triplet with states having spin and parity quantum numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16",
    "is usually known in near spherical nuclei .",
    "the absence of @xmath17 members of this two - phonon multiplet points at the bosonic character of the identical quadrupole phonons involved .",
    "multi - quadrupole - phonon states ( with @xmath18 ) have also been identified , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the investigation and identification of double giant dipole resonances ( 2gdr ) , ( @xmath19 ) double - octupole states and ( @xmath20 ) double - gamma - vibrations in deformed nuclei are actively debated in the literature , see e.g. refs . @xcite .",
    "the mixed - multipolarity ( @xmath21 ) quadrupole - octupole coupled quintuplet @xcite with spin and parity quantum numbers @xmath22  @xmath23 is a very interesting example of the coupling of two different phonons .",
    "members of the ( @xmath21 ) two - phonon quintuplet should decay by definition by collective @xmath1 and @xmath0 transitions to the @xmath24 octupole phonon state and to the @xmath4 quadrupole phonon state , respectively .",
    "the ( @xmath21 ) two - phonon states are expected to occur close to the sum energy @xmath25 .",
    "there are only a few examples , e.g. @xmath26sm  @xcite , @xmath26nd  @xcite , @xmath27ce  @xcite and @xmath28cd  @xcite , where besides the two - phonon @xmath29 state other multiplet members have been identified experimentally",
    ". the reason might be that all the other states from the @xmath21 quintuplet , except the @xmath29 , are strongly mixed with non - collective excitations , losing their pure quadrupole  octupole nature .",
    "this is supported by shell - model calculations performed recently for @xmath30 nuclei  @xcite .",
    "thus , the most complete data , which can be used as a testing ground for the concept of quadrupole - octupole coupled two - phonon excitations , are the transition strengths from the mostly unfragmented @xmath29 member of the quintuplet .",
    "the @xmath22 two - phonon state has been very well investigated in magic and near spherical nuclei . in many nuclei",
    ", it has been identified close to the sum energy @xmath31 , indicating a quite harmonic phonon coupling @xcite . according to its definition ,",
    "the two - phonon @xmath29 state should decay by a collective one - phonon @xmath1 transition to the @xmath11 octupole phonon state .",
    "this has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the collective @xmath32 @xmath0 transition has not yet been measured due to the possibly dominating @xmath2 and @xmath33 contaminations in this transition .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of the two - phonon @xmath29 state is the existence of a relatively strong @xmath2 transition to the ground state , which can be sensitively measured in photon scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the strength of this two - phonon annihilating @xmath2 transition approximately equals the strength of the @xmath34 two - phonon changing @xmath2 transition @xcite which strongly supports quadrupole - octupole - collective origin of these @xmath2 transitions .",
    "all the low - energy one - phonon and two - phonon states mentioned above involve isoscalar phonons .",
    "recently the isovector quadrupole excitation in the valence shell , the @xmath35 state , has been identified @xcite in some nuclei from the measurement of absolute transition strengths , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "isovector excitations in the valence shell form a whole class of low - lying collective states called , more precisely , mixed - symmetry states @xcite .",
    "the fundamental @xmath35 state decays by a weakly collective @xmath1 transition to the ground state and by a strong @xmath3 transition to the isoscalar @xmath4 state , with an @xmath3 matrix element of the order of one nuclear magneton @xcite . in an harmonic phonon coupling scheme one can expect also the existence of mixed - symmetry two - phonon multiplets , that involve at least one excitation of the mixed - symmetry quadrupole phonon .",
    "two symmetric  mixed - symmetric ( @xmath36 ) two - quadrupole phonon excitations with positive parity , namely a @xmath37 state ( the scissors mode ) , and a @xmath38 state have been identified already in the near spherical nucleus @xmath39mo @xcite .",
    "similarly one can expect the existence of a ( @xmath40 ) mixed - symmetry quadrupole - octupole coupled multiplet with negative parity . in a naive phonon coupling picture members of this quintuplet should show a very complex but , nevertheless , simple to understand decay pattern , which can be predicted from the decay properties of the one - phonon excitations ( weakly - collective @xmath1 decay and strong @xmath3 decay of the @xmath35 state , and collective @xmath0 and relatively strong @xmath2 decay of the @xmath24 octupole vibration ) .",
    "for instance , the @xmath41 state should decay by relatively strong @xmath2 , strong @xmath3 , weakly - collective @xmath1 , and collective @xmath0 transitions to the ground and to the @xmath42 scissors state , to the ordinary , isoscalar ( @xmath21 ) multiplet , and to the one - phonon @xmath11 and @xmath35 states , respectively ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "recently , @xmath7 transitions between the @xmath11 octupole phonon state and the @xmath35 state have been observed experimentally @xcite in near spherical nuclei . for an understanding of these new observations it is necessary to investigate the interrelation of the octupole phonon state and the mixed - symmetry @xmath35 state theoretically .",
    "that is one aim of the present article .",
    "another purpose of this article is the proposal of possible two - phonon states generated by the coupling of the octupole degree of freedom with the proton - neutron degree of freedom and the quantitative investigation of the properties of such constructions .",
    "a convenient and sometimes successful approach to new and complicated physical phenomena is the investigation of symmetries and the algebraic solution of symmetric hamiltonians . in low - energy nuclear structure physics",
    "this task can be achieved by application of the algebraic interacting boson model @xcite .",
    "since we deal simultaneously with the isoscalar octupole vibration and the isovector quadrupole vibration in the valence shell of near spherical nuclei , we need a model which incorporates them both .",
    "we apply for the first time the @xmath5-ibm-2 , which considers @xmath43 monopole ( @xmath44 ) bosons , @xmath45 quadrupole ( @xmath46 ) bosons , @xmath47 octupole ( @xmath48 ) bosons , and the proton - neutron ( @xmath49 - @xmath50 ) degree of freedom @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop the formalism of the @xmath5-ibm-2 in two particular dynamical symmetry limits relevant for the description of vibrational and @xmath51-unstable nuclei . in section [ sec : qn ] we discuss the group reduction chains of the @xmath5-ibm-2 and the quantum numbers , which are necessary to classify the eigenstates of the dynamically symmetric hamiltonians .",

    "states with smaller @xmath6-spin quantum numbers @xmath74 are called mixed - symmetry states and correspond to non - symmetric representations of the u@xmath71(13 ) group .",

    "studies of @xmath2-strength distribution in @xmath171ce  @xcite report that the lowest @xmath29 state exhibits an enhanced dipole transition to the ground state , while transitions from a number of higher lying @xmath29 states are considerably weaker although they lie closer to the gdr and although they are calculated to have predominantly a simple 1p1h - structure , which would even favor a mixing with the gdr .",
    "thus , the observed concentration of @xmath2-strength in the lowest @xmath29 states should not be simply attributed to admixtures of the gdr into the states wave function if not at the same time the smaller @xmath2 strengths of higher lying @xmath29 states are explained , too .",
    "it is even more striking that a model which can treat all these @xmath2 excitations on the same footing , the microscopic quasiparticle phonon model , supports the interpretation of enhanced low - lying @xmath2 transitions due to quadrupole - octupole collectivity @xcite .",
    "therefore , another approach is preferable .",
    "the multiphonon structure of excitations in vibrational nuclei as well as an octupole or quadrupole - octupole coupled origin of negative - parity states , naturally suggests an @xmath2-transition operator which contains a quadrupole - octupole coupled two - body part .",

    "here we are particularly interested in the electric dipole transitions which connect the octupole @xmath180 state with the symmetric @xmath4 state and with the mixed - symmetry @xmath181 state , as well as in those which connect the @xmath182 two - phonon negative parity multiplet with the ground state band .",

    "it is worthwhile to look closely to the analytical expressions in table iii in order recognize the fingerprints of the simple phonon picture the consideration of which has guided us to the present model .",
    "the @xmath2 transition strengths from the @xmath24 state to the symmetric and mixed - symmetry one - phonon quadrupole excitations , the @xmath4 state and the @xmath35 state , are both of the order of @xmath185 , i.e. , they can be strong on an absolute scale and comparable",

    "however , here the @xmath6-scalar @xmath191 @xmath2 strength must be expected to be larger than the @xmath6-vector @xmath2 strength of the @xmath192 transition because the parameter @xmath193 usually takes values between 0 and 1 leading to a reduction of the @xmath6-vector @xmath2 strength which is proportional to the factor @xmath194 .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the properties of the new mixed - symmetry @xmath29 states , @xmath190 and @xmath195 .",
    "the direct @xmath2 ground state excitation strengths to the @xmath195 state is only of the order of @xmath196 and therefore much smaller than the @xmath2 strength to the @xmath190 state , which is of the order of @xmath185 .",
    "the @xmath197 @xmath1 strength is of the order of n , which indicates quadrupole collectivity .",
    "since it is proportional to the square of the difference of the effective quadrupole boson charges @xmath198 this transition should be weakly collective like the known @xmath199 one - quadrupole phonon decay .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath200 @xmath1 strength is of the order of @xmath201 and can not be large .",
    "very interesting are also the @xmath3 transitions between symmetric and mixed - symmetry negative parity states .",
    "the @xmath3 strengths from the @xmath190 state to the quadrupole - octupole coupled @xmath29 and @xmath202 two - phonon states are of the order of @xmath185 and should be comparable to the @xmath203 strong @xmath3 transition .",
    "the @xmath204 @xmath3 transitions are of the order of @xmath196 if the @xmath46-boson part alone is used in the @xmath3 transition operator ( [ tm1 ] ) .",
