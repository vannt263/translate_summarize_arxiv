    "the existence of the extragalactic diffuse gamma - ray background ( egrb ) has been revealed first by the sas-2 satellite ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "better determinations of the flux and spectrum of egrb were achieved by the egret detector on board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the most reliable measurement of egrb has very recently been reported based on the data of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope ( @xcite ) , and the egrb spectrum is well described by a single power - law with a photon index of @xmath6 and the photon flux of about @xmath7 above 100 mev ( @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of egrb has been discussed for a long time and various sources have been discussed as possible contributors to egrb , such as active galactic nuclei ( agns , especially blazars ) , galaxy clusters , intergalactic shocks produced by structure formation , and dark matter annihilation ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "almost all of the known extragalactic gamma - ray sources are blazars , and their contribution to the egrb has been intensively studied ( e.g. , inoue & totani 2009 ; venters 2010 ; abdo et al .",
    "2010d , and references therein ) .",
    "however , star - forming galaxies should also be gamma - ray emitters by cosmic - ray interactions with interstellar medium ( ism ) and interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there must be non - zero contribution to egrb .",
    "this is obvious because we know that the galactic disk is a strong source of diffuse gamma - rays , and gamma - rays from large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have been detected by egret ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , gamma - ray emission in gev ",
    "tev from small magellanic cloud ( smc , @xcite ) and two nearby starburst galaxies , m82 and ngc 253 , have recently been discovered by h.e.s.s .",
    "( @xcite ) , veritas ( @xcite ) , and _ fermi _ ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a new estimate of the contribution from star - forming galaxies to egrb .",
    "there are a number of previous studies on this issue ( strong et al . 1976 ; lichti et al . 1978 ; dar & shaviv 1995 ; pavlidou & fields 2002 ; thompson et al . 2007 ;",

    "it is often calculated against the unresolved component of egrb , but it depends on the flux sensitivity of a particular detector . throughout the paper , `` the contribution to egrb '' is defined against the total egrb flux , which we estimated from the resolved and unresolved components of the _ fermi _ data ( abdo et al .",
    "we used a photon index of 2.4 for resolved blazars",
    "( abdo et al .",
    "2010d ) to extrapolate the resolved component from 200 to 100 mev . ] .",
    "most of these studies calculated gamma - ray luminosity ( @xmath0 ) from star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies , because the cosmic - ray energy input is expected to be proportional to sfr . however , if escape of cosmic - rays from galaxies is significant , sfr can not be used as a reliable indicator of @xmath0 ( see  [ sec : modelinglg ] in more details ) .",
    "several studies used infrared luminosity of galaxies as sfr indicators , but ir luminosity ( especially at far - ir in early - type galaxies ) is not a perfect sfr estimator because a significant amount of dust can be heated by isrf from relatively old stars ( e.g. , salim et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "amount of interstellar gas should also be important to determine @xmath0 , because the degree of cosmic - ray escape is affected by the target amount .",
    "in fact , recent observations indicate that gamma - ray luminosity is nicely correlated with the product of sfr and gas mass in galaxies(abdo et al .",
    "pavlidou & fields ( 2002 ) included gas mass in the theoretical prediction of egrb using the data of the cosmic star formation history ( csfh ) .",
    "galaxies in the universe is considered as a closed box containing stellar and gas mass in present - day galaxies , and csfh is used to solve the time evolution of relative fractions of stars and gas .",
    "however this approach likely overestimates the gas mass contributing to gamma - ray production at high redshifts , because most of the present - day stellar mass is in the form of gas and assumed to contribute to gamma - ray emission . in reality , only the gas in collapsed dark halos can contribute to cosmic - ray interactions in galaxies , which is a small fraction at high redshifts according to the structure formation theory .",
    "recently , fields et al .",
    "( 2010 ) incorporated gas mass in galaxies using the schmidt - kennicutt relation in their calculation of egrb . in this case",
    "one must know galaxy size to relate sfr and @xmath2 , and a single value of galaxy size at each redshift was assumed as a simple model .    here",
    "we present a new calculation of the contribution from star - forming galaxies in egrb using a state - of - the - art theoretical model of galaxy formation in the framework of hierarchical galaxy formation , which is in quantitative agreement with a variety of observations at high redshifts as well as the local universe .",
    "an advantage of our approach compared with previous studies is that we can calculate both sfr and gas mass of individual galaxies at various redshits .",
    "furthermore , we utilize the information of the gamma - ray spectra recently observed for nearby starbursts , in addition to the standard spectrum of the galactic diffuse emission , to predict the egrb spectrum based on the galaxy formation model including both quiescent and starburst galaxy populations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe our model calculations .",
    "we present the results on egrb and statistics about the number of nearby galaxies detectable by _ fermi _ in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "after discussion on the uncertainties in our calculation (  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) and implications for the origin of egrb (  [ sec : egrb - origin ] ) , conclusions will be presented in  [ sec : conclusions ] . in this work , cosmological parameters of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are adopted .",
    "we use a mock numerical galaxy catalog produced by one of the latest so - called semi - analytic models ( sams ) of hierarchical galaxy formation [ the mitaka model ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ] . in general , sams compute merging history of dark matter ( dm ) halos based on the standard structure formation theory driven by cold dark matter , and include several important physical processes related to the evolution of baryons in dm halos such as radiative gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , galaxy merger , stellar population synthesis , chemical evolution , and extinction by interstellar dust ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in each time step of the halo merging history ,",
    "two discrete modes of star formation are considered in the model , i.e. , starburst and quiescent .",
    "when galaxies experience a major galaxy merger , intensive burst of star formation is assumed to occur ( the starburst mode ) , and all of the available cold gas is converted into stars and hot gas within a short time .",
    "otherwise star formation proceeds at a modest rate determined by cold gas amount and dynamical time scales ( the quiescent mode ) .",
    "the mitaka model can quantitatively reproduce a wide variety of observed characteristics of local galaxies , including luminosity functions ( lfs ) and scaling relations among various observables such as magnitude , colors , surface brightness , size , gas mass - to - light ratio , and metallicity ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) . moreover",
    ", it can also reproduce well the cosmic star formation history ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ) , the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) continuum lf of lyman break galaxies at @xmath11 and 5 ( @xcite ) , and all of the available observations for the high-@xmath12 ly@xmath13 emitters ( ly@xmath13 and uv continuum lfs , and ly@xmath13 equivalent width distributions ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the version of the mitaka model used here",
    ", about 100 monte - carlo realizations of merger histories are produced for dm halos in a dm mass interval of 0.1 dex at each output redshift ranging @xmath14 010 .",
    "the model calculates dm halos with velocity dispersions larger than 30 km / s , and this allows us to make a reliable prediction in the stellar mass range of @xmath15 , roughly corresponding to the absolute @xmath16 band magnitude of @xmath17 mag .      to calculate the egrb flux from normal galaxies , we need the gamma - ray lf @xmath18 ( comoving number density of galaxies per unit gamma - ray luminosity ) as a function of redshift .",
    "here , @xmath0 is defined as gamma - ray luminosity in the rest - frame photon energy range of 0.15 gev .",
    "the lf @xmath19 is calculated from the mock galaxy catalog by modeling gamma - ray luminosity of each galaxy as follows .",
    "diffuse gamma - ray radiation in galaxies is produced by the interactions between the cosmic - rays and ism .",
    "if the cosmic - ray losses are dominated by escape , the gamma - ray luminosity is set by equilibrium between cosmic ray production and escape .",
    "it is then expected that gamma - ray luminosity depends on sfr ( @xmath1 , an indicator of cosmic ray production rate ) and mass of interstellar gas ( @xmath2 , the amount of target for cosmic rays to interact before escape ) , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "we call it `` the escape limit '' . however , if the cosmic - ray energy losses are dominated by inelastic collision with interstellar gas and almost all of the cosmic - ray energy is converted into gamma - rays , the gamma - ray luminosity is no longer dependent on the amount of gas , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "we call it `` the calorimetric limit '' .",

    "since it is difficult to model the detailed escape and energy loss processes of cosmic - rays in galaxies , we consider both of these two simple limiting cases .",
    "to establish the link between @xmath0 and @xmath1 and/or @xmath20 , we collected the observed values of these quantities for the nearby galaxies of smc , lmc , the milky way ( mw ) , m82 , and ngc 253 .",
    "they are summarized in table [ table : lg - sfr - mgas ] . for smc and lmc ,",
    "sfrs are estimated from h@xmath13 luminosities @xcite , using the relationship of @xcite assuming the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) in 0.1100 @xmath21 .",
    "extinction by dust is not taken into account , and the uncertainty about this will be discussed later (  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) . for m82 and ngc 253 , we used sfr estimated from the ir luminosity from interstellar dust , using the relationship of @xcite assuming the same imf as above , since these galaxies has large extinction ( @xcite and @xcite ) and h@xmath13 is no longer a good indicator of sfr .",
    "total ir luminosity is calculated from the iras fluxes in the three bands ( @xcite ) using the formula given in @xcite .",
    "since it is difficult to estimate the total ir luminosity of mw , we use the supernova rate estimated by a gamma - ray observation ( @xcite ) and converted it into sfr assuming the same imf .",
    "the standard value of 8 @xmath21 is adopted for the mass threshold of core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "the gas mass is estimated by the total of @xmath22 and , where the former and the latter are measured by co and 21-cm line observations , respectively .",
    "the references are shown in table [ table : lg - sfr - mgas ] .",
    "there are various estimations for mass of smc and lmc by different authors ( @xcite , @xcite , for smc , and @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite , for lmc ) . here",
    "we adopted the latest value by , and the standard deviations of the mass measurements among difference papers were added to the errors as a quadratic sum , to take into account the uncertainty ( table [ table : lg - sfr - mgas ] ) .    the collected data are plotted in figure [ fig : correlation ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that there is a good correlation both for the @xmath0-@xmath23 ( top panel ) and @xmath0-@xmath1 relations ( bottom panel ) .",

    "since sfr of mw has a large uncertainty , we did not use the data of mw in the fitting , although it is consistent with the correlation .",
    "the exact proportionality between @xmath0 and @xmath23 or @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not necessarily expected , because it depends on propagation and degree of confinement of cosmic rays within a galaxy .",
    "therefore we use these power - law relation to calculate gamma - ray luminosity .",
    "the cases of the exact proportionality , i.e. , @xmath27 and @xmath28 will also be discussed later (  [ sec : uncertainties ] ) .    it should be noted that @xmath2 in the mitaka model has been compared with observations of local galaxies as a function of @xmath16 band galaxy luminosity ( nagashima & yoshii 2004 ; nagashima et al .",
    "2005 ) , showing a good agreement .",
    "this gives a support to apply @xmath2 of the mitaka model to the @xmath29-@xmath23 relation determined by observations , though the model has not yet been tested against @xmath2 at high redshifts because only very few observations are available .",
    "as for sfr , the adopted imf in the mitaka model ( the salpeter in 0.160 @xmath21 ) is slightly different from that ( in 0.1100 @xmath21 ) assumed in converting the observed ir luminosity to sfr in fig . [",
    "fig : correlation ] . though the value of sfr is hardly affected by the upper bound of stellar mass in imf",
    ", it may affect the conversion from ir luminosity to sfr .",
    "however we confirmed , using the pegase stellar library ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , that the difference of the imf mass ranges hardly affects the total luminosity from young stars because stars heavier than 60 @xmath21 are scarce and have short lifetimes .",
    "it is negligible at the stellar population ages larger than @xmath30 yrs , and at most 20% at ages younger than that",
    ". therefore we can apply sfrs in the mitaka model to the fitting formula eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lg - sfr - mgas ] ) and ( [ eq : lg - sfr ] ) .",
    "we also need to model the gamma - ray spectrum of galaxies to predict the egrb spectrum .",
    "the observed gamma - ray spectra of mw , m82 , and ngc 253 are shown in figure [ fig : specs ] .",
    "we simply assume that quiescent galaxies have the same spectral shape as that of mw . for the mw spectrum we used the galprop fit to the _ fermi _ spectral data of the galactic diffuse gamma - rays ( @xcite ) .",
    "the observed spectrum of smc and lmc are similar to that of mw .    for starburst galaxies",
    ", we expect some change of gamma - ray spectrum by the following physical reason . because of the high density of star forming regions , it is plausible that starburst galaxies are `` calorimetric '' and have harder spectrum than quiescent galaxies because of less significant espace of high energy cosmic rays",
    ". therefore we apply two modelings for the starburst spectra : ( 1 ) starbursts have the same spectrum as mw , and ( 2 ) the mw - like spectrum at low energy range and a hard power - law tail at high energy range .",
    "we fitted the spectrum of m82 and ngc 253 by the mw spectrum at energy less than 10 gev , and with power law above the 10 gev .",
    "normalization of the power law component was determined so that it smoothly connects to the mw spectrum at 10 gev .",
    "( therefore the free parameters of the fit are two : the normalization of mw component and the photon index of high - energy power - law component . ) as a result of the fitting , we find that m82 and ngc 253 can be fit with almost the same photon index of 2.2 , and hence we adopt this spectrum when we try a different spectrum from mw for starburst galaxies .",
    "these model spectra are shown in figure [ fig : specs ] .      given the modeling of gamma - ray luminosity of galaxies described above , the egrb flux and spectrum can be calculated by integrating the gamma - ray luminosity function @xmath31 over redshift . to see the redshift evolution of the gamma - ray emissivity",

    "the rest - frame gamma - ray spectrum of galaxies @xmath43 can be calculated for a given @xmath0 by the spectral shapes as modeled in the previous section , where @xmath44 is a photon energy at the rest - frame of the source redshifts .",
    "we set the maximum redshift @xmath45 corresponding to that of the galaxy formation model , but this parameter hardly affects the egrb flux because the majority of the egrb flux comes from galaxies at @xmath46 ( see  [ sec : results ] below ) .",
    "high energy photons ( @xmath47 20 gev ) are absorbed during the propagation in intergalactic space , by interaction with the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) photons producing electron - positron pairs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth @xmath48 in equation ( 2 ) represents this interaction .",
    "since the infrared emission from dust has not yet been included in the mitaka model , @xmath49 can not be calculated self - consistently based on the mitaka model .",

    "is also shown .",
    "it can be seen that the intergalactic absorption attenuates the egrb flux by a factor of about 1.3 at the highest photon energy of _ fermi_. the fraction of the absorbed energy flux of egrb is not a large amount compared with the total egrb energy flux , and hence the cascade component does not make a significant contribuiton at the low energy bands ( note that fig .",

    "it should also be noted that the classification of quiescent and starburst galaxies in the mitaka model is determined to reproduce the optical / infrared observed properties of galaxies . therefore the classification can be systematically different if we do it by the difference of gamma - ray spectra .",

    "this result gives another support to the reliability of our egrb prediction .",
    "however , it should be noted that in this estimate all galaxies in the mitaka model are assumed to distribute randomly in space with a uniform mean density , because the clustering information of galaxy distribution is not included in the semi - analytic models like the mitaka model . the density fluctuation and clustering in the local group around mw should affect the above estimate , especially for satellite galaxies like lmc .",

    "there is a large scatter in the correlation between size and gamma - ray luminosity , but the average angular size of model galaxies brighter than _ fermi _ 1-yr sensitivity is @xmath50.05 deg , which is much smaller than the _ fermi _ angular resolution ( @xmath93 deg at 1 gev , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the effect of extended sources should not significantly affect the above estimate for the number of detectable sources .",
    "it should also be noted that the size of an active star - forming region in a galaxy can be much smaller than that of the stellar disk of the same galaxy , as inferred from observations of ngc 253 ( @xcite ) . therefore gamma - ray emitting regions can be much smaller than the size of the model galaxies in the mitaka model .",

    "the sfrs estimated by ir luminosities of smc and lmc are @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively , by the same method as for sfr estimates of m 82 and ngc 253 described in ",
    "[ sec : modelinglg ] .",
    "these are 4060% of sfrs by h@xmath13 , indicating that these galaxies are not heavily obscured by dust .",
    "when we add the sfrs estimated by ir luminosity to the sfrs of smc and lmc , the egrb flux from star - forming galaxies changes slightly by a factor of 1.2 . on the other hand , starburst galaxies ( m82 , ngc 253 ) have large extinctions and hence sfrs estimated by ir luminosity are much bigger than those by h@xmath13 , as mentioned in  [ sec : modelinglg ] .    in the previous version of this paper put on the preprint server ( arxiv:1005.1390v1 ) , we reported about 14% contribution from star - forming galaxies to the total egrb flux , which is about two times bigger than our new result .",
    "we examined the reason for this , and found that it is mainly due to the smaller sfr of lmc used in the previous version , which was estimated only by ir luminosity .",
    "as mentioned above , sfr from h@xmath13 luminosity is about two times larger than that from ir for lmc ans smc .",
    "( adding smc to the nearby sample is also a new point of the current version , but it does not significantly affect the egrb flux . ) therefore we believe that our new result is more appropriate , but it would be better to consider that the systematic uncertainty of the egrb flux from star - forming galaxies is not smaller than a factor of two , given the small number of nearby galaxies with observed gamma - ray luminosities and uncertainties in estimates of sfr and gas mass .",
    "cc & +    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      our result indicates that about 10% of egrb can naturally be explained by star - forming galaxies .",
    "here we discuss the origin of egrb in general , also considering the larger contribution from agns . in figs .",
    "[ fig : egrb1 ] and [ fig : egrb2 ] , we plotted the egrb model of agns by inoue & totani ( 2009 , hereafter it09 ) .",
    "the it09 model includes two populations of agns : one is blazars , and the other is non - blazars that are responsible for the egrb at 110 mev .",
    "here we plotted models of u03(@xmath105 ) and @xmath106 ( see it09 for details ) .",
    "many blazars have been detected by egret and fermi , and it is obvious that they are the major contributor to egrb .",
    "the blazar component of it09 can account for 43% of the total egrb flux , which is in good agreement with the latest observational estimate of abdo et al .",
    "( 2010d ) based on the latest _ fermi _ data40% in good agreement with it09 . ] .",
    "therefore , adding the component from star - forming galaxies , more than 50% of egrb can be explained by the sum of surely existing sources . the non - blazar agn component of it09 has not yet been confirmed by observations , but it is introduced to explain the background radiation from hard x - ray to mev region in a physically natural way ( inoue et al .",
    "if this component extends to @xmath5 100 mev , the contribution to egrb flux at @xmath81100 mev could be @xmath107% , and hence it is not difficult to explain @xmath108 70% of egrb by theoretically reasonable sources .",
    "it should also be noted that both the agn component and star - forming galaxy component have remarkably similar spectra to the observed _ fermi _ egrb .    the @xmath5130% residual of egrb",
    "may not be explained simply by the sum of agns and star - forming galaxies , and there may be a room for different populations such as galaxy clusters or dark matter annihilation . however , there are still uncertainties in the modeling of agn gamma - ray luminosity function .",
    "the blazar luminosity function of it09 was based on egret data , including uncertainties about detection and identification efficiencies depending on the location in the sky .",
    "the recent observational estimate of the blazar contribution by _ fermi _ data includes a large correction about detection efficiency near the sensitivity limit , which is generally dependent on models .",
    "blazars are highly variable sources , and it should add another uncertainty in egrb estimates .",
    "therefore we conclude that a large part of egrb can be explained by known or physically reasonable sources , and there is no strong evidence for exotic components like dark matter annihilation .",
    "we have presented a new calculation of egrb from cosmic - ray interactions in star - forming galaxies , based on a state - of - the - art galaxy formation model in the framework of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the galaxy formation model is quantitatively consistent with various observations at high redshifts as well as the local universe .",
    "gamma - ray luminosities of galaxies are calculated by star formation rate and gas mass in model galaxies , with the relation @xmath94 ( the escape limit ) or @xmath95 ( the calorimetric limit ) which are calibrated by the recent observational data of nearby galaxies .",
    "the predicted number of nearby galaxies that are detectable by _ fermi _ is consistent with the actual number observed so far .",
    "we found that star - forming galaxies make 47% contribution to the total egrb flux reported by _",
    "fermi _ in our standard model . combined with the contribution from blazars as estimated by the _ fermi _",
    "data , more than @xmath550% of egrb can be accounted for . if the soft power - law tail of cxb is extending from mev to gev region as expected from the mev background data and theoretical considerations of agn accretion disks ( inoue et al .",
    "2008 ) , additional @xmath520 % can be explained .",
    "the combined spectrum by agns and star - forming galaxies is remarkably similar to the observed egrb spectrum .",
    "it should be noted that there is no free parameters that can be tuned to fit the obeserved egrb spectrum in the present model ; the blazar egrb spectrum of it09 is determined by the spectral templates of the blazar sed ( spectral energy distribution ) sequence , and that of the star - forming galaxy component in the present work by templates constructed by observed nearby galaxies .",
    "therefore we conclude that a large part ( @xmath10870% ) of egrb can be explained by reasonable sources of agns and star - forming galaxies .",
    "further examination is required to see whether the apparent @xmath5130% residual of egrb is mainly a result of modeling uncertainties , experimental / observational uncertainties in deriving the egrb data , or significant contributions from completely different source populations . given the good spectral agreement of the _ fermi _ data and agns / star - forming galaxies , the rest of egrb is also likely dominated by astrophysical sources accelerating particles , even if a completely diffrent population is responsible for it .",
    "it is in contrast that a large part of the blazar component of egrb will be resolved into discrete sources by the ultimate _ fermi _ sensitivity in the near future ( it09 ) , while almost all of the star - forming galaxy component will remain unresolved because of the faintness of individual sources .",
    "therefore , any exotic contribution like dark matter annihilation can not be probed directly under the level of the star - forming galaxies , i.e. , @xmath5 10% of the total egrb flux .",
    "another approach such as utilizing anisotropy would be required to search for the signal under that level ( see , e.g. ando et al .",
    "2007 ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )    we assumed a simple empirical relation between gamma - ray luminosity , sfr , and gas mass of galaxies .",
    "only two spectral templates were used in the calculation .",
    "a next step would be to construct a more physical model of gamma - ray luminosity and spectrum based on a larger number of physical quantities ( e.g. , size and stellar radiation field in addition to sfr and gas mass ) , taking into account propagation of cosmic - rays and production processes of gamma - rays .",
