    "a class of electromechanical problems couple magnetism and elasticity .",
    "a magneto - elastic coupled model is relevant for the development of electric motor , sensor and actuator technologies , and much work have been done to make such modeling available to engineers @xcite . in modeling , it is commonplace to rely on a variational formulation of the coupled problem .",
    "variational formulation is also adopted in a recent paper by bossavit @xcite .",
    "therein , a small - strain magneto - elastic model is built on an analogy between magnetism and small - strain elasticity , with emphasis on finite element implementation using whitney elements .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the formulation of small - strain magneto - elastic problems using analysis on manifolds .",
    "accordingly , we will be precise about the mathematical structures used in different parts of the analysis .",
    "this is how mathematics deals with the same thing which is called coordinate system invariances in physics .",
    "for example , defining maxwell s equations on differentiable manifold means the corresponding coordinate equations are invariant to general coordinate transformations . on the other hand , to express certain equations in a coordinate independent manner , we will introduce additional structure on the manifold .",
    "example of an equation which we express by using additional structure  that of a connection  is the mechanical equilibrium equation . in short ,",
    "the manifold theory serves to drive information from coordinates to well defined mathematical structures .",
    "this makes possible a condensed presentation , allowing rapid access to the magneto - elasticity problem for mathematically informed reader .    as a prerequisite",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with differential forms , and the basic tools of differential geometry .",
    "in particular , one recognizes the exterior derivative as the counterpart for the gradient , curl and divergence of vector analysis .",
    "for example , the gauss s law and ampere s law in magnetostatics are naturally expressed by using the exterior derivative , whose definition requires only the differentiable structure . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic constitutive law requires more structure , and is expressed in the variational formulation by using a magnetic energy density object .    for algebraic similarity between elasticity and magnetism",
    ", we will introduce the reader to vector- and covector - valued differential forms together with their natural product @xcite .",
    "these notions require only the differentiable structure .",
    "in addition , we present some related tools of differential geometry . among these",
    "there is the covariant exterior derivative , whose definition requires the additional structure of a connection @xcite . similarly to magnetism the constitutive law between stress and strain will be expressed in the variational framework by using an energy density object .    when it comes to magneto - elasticity , a variational formulation involves , in general , magneto - elastic energy density .",
    "such magneto - elastic energy density constitutes a way to express `` coupled constitutive laws '' , and it implies that magneto - elasticity can not be meaningfully separated into `` magnetic '' and `` elastic '' parts . such genuine magneto - elastic coupling is often called magnetostriction @xcite . here , we give two alternative mathematical constructs for magneto - elasticity , both of them allowing magnetostriction .",
    "the given analysis shows that certain problems of magnetism , small - strain elasticity , and small - strain magneto - elasticity may be modeled by using geometric constructs that are in many ways similar algebraically .",
    "this makes it relevant to search for _ algebraic category _ for the modeling of a class of such problems .",
    "we argue that the detailed specification of an appropriate category should be made such that ( i ) it is general enough to cover important problems , and ( ii ) its discretization to the category of finite dimensional vector spaces can be realized .",
    "an analysis such as the one given here is a necessary step in the way to specify an appropriate category .",
    "to position the formulation of this paper into a more general context , we begin by introducing material bodies , the underlying ( classical ) space - time , and the notion of observer .",
    "these notions are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , and are reproduced here ( using slightly different notation ) to make the paper self - contained .",
    "moreover , we specify here the observers allowed by the given formulation .    in classical space - time",
    ", the notion of simultaneity has absolute meaning , and simultaneous events may be identified with a reference manifold . by observation of space - time we mean the process of making such an identification for all time instants .",
    "independently of observation , it is assumed that time `` passes '' homogeneously and distances between simultaneous events can be determined .",
    "it is noted that to formalize this intuition , there is no need to invoke affine euclidean structure ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    given 4-dimensional manifold @xmath0 , and 3-dimensional manifold @xmath1 , a diffeomorphism @xmath2",
    "is called a _ slicing_. we define @xmath3 for each @xmath4 .",
    "the manifold @xmath0 is _ classical space - time _",
    "if    * there is surjective map @xmath5 , called universal time , with everywhere non - vanishing derivative , such that @xmath6 is diffeomorphic to @xmath1 for all @xmath4 * there is a slicing @xmath7 which is compatible with time , that is , @xmath8 for all @xmath4 * there is a symmetric connection on @xmath0 by which @xmath9 is covariant constant * on each @xmath10 there is a riemannian metric @xmath11 , whose levi - civita connection @xmath12 coincides with the restriction of the space - time connection to @xmath10 .    a slicing @xmath7 of classical space - time is called an _",
    "observer_. an observer that is compatible with time ( item ( ii ) ) is called _",
    "newtonian observer_.    newtonian observer @xmath7 perceives simultaneous events at time @xmath13 using @xmath14 .",
    "this may be used to carry the metric @xmath11 and connection @xmath12 to @xmath1 .",
    "accordingly , we define the _ metric observed by @xmath15 on @xmath1 at time @xmath13 _ as @xmath16 , and the _ connection observed by @xmath15 on @xmath1 at time @xmath13 _ as @xmath17 ( defined using the push - forward by @xmath18 ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath19 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath20 .",
    "if there is a fixed ( time - independent ) metric @xmath21 on @xmath1 , newtonian observer @xmath15 is called _ rigid _ if @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .    to describe material body in space - time , we let @xmath24 be a reference manifold ( with @xmath25 ) , and define _ world tube for @xmath24 _ as a map @xmath26 such that the map @xmath27 is an embedding , and fulfills @xmath28 , for all @xmath4 .",
    "the path @xmath29 is the _ world line for @xmath30_. the `` absolute '' velocity , or _",
    "four - velocity _ , of the world line for @xmath30 is the velocity vector field of the world line , and its `` absolute '' acceleration , or _ four - acceleration _ ,",
    "is given by taking the covariant derivative of the four - velocity along the world line , using the space - time connection .",
    "going through all points @xmath31 gives the four - velocity and four - acceleration of the world tube @xmath32 .",
    "in particular , newtonian observer @xmath7 is a world tube for @xmath1 , and has a well - defined four - velocity and four - acceleration .    given a world tube @xmath33 and a newtonian observer @xmath7 , the _ motion of @xmath24 on @xmath1 relative to @xmath15 _ is the map @xmath34 defined by @xmath35 .",
    "the _ ( `` apparent '' ) velocity of @xmath32 relative to @xmath15 _ is the velocity vector field of @xmath36 ( defined by sewing together the velocity vector fields of the paths @xmath37 corresponding to all @xmath31 .",
    "the _ ( `` apparent '' ) acceleration of @xmath32 relative to @xmath15 _ is given by taking the covariant derivative of the relative velocities of material points along the paths @xmath37 , using the ( possibly time dependent ) connection observed on @xmath1 by @xmath15 .    using this setup , it is straightforward to derive , in particular , the transformation of relative velocities and accelerations under change of observer .",
    "these transformations are not given here , for we will restrict the analysis to statics , and allow only _ inertial _ observers , namely , those whose velocity field is covariant constant and whose acceleration therefore vanishes .",
    "the following analysis serves as our opening to the modeling of magneto - elastic coupled problems , and it will need to be extended to allow for dynamics and non - inertial observers .",
    "in particular , this would require considering the non - tensorial transformation of accelerations and forces under change of observer ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to restricting the analysis to small - strain elastostatics , a restriction is made to hyper - elastic constitutive laws , meaning that elastic energy density will be assumed .",
    "( it is noted that large amount of work have been made on the geometric analysis of the general elastic problem  and continuum mechanics in general  that is free of these restrictive assumptions , see for example @xcite . )",
    "an analysis that restricts to small - strain magneto - hyper - elasticity is justified by the significance of this model in important applications , such as electric motor , sensor , and actuator technologies .",
    "let us assume that a rigid inertial observer @xmath7 is given , and denote as @xmath38 the observed ( time - independent ) riemannian metric on @xmath1 .",
    "further , let us denote as @xmath34 the motion of @xmath24 in @xmath1 relative to @xmath15 , and as @xmath39 a stress - free reference configuration .",
    "intuitively , we will be concerned with an infinitesimal displacement of material points from the reference configuration . to formulate the problem on @xmath24 , we consider _ displacement _ @xmath40 as a vector field on @xmath24 .",
    "this is appropriate because we assume both @xmath24 and @xmath1 to be 3-dimensional .",
    "( more general modelings , where @xmath24 and @xmath1 may be of different dimension , can be found in continuum mechanics literature . )",
    "this is a slightly atypical choice of a modeling quantity , as the spatial displacement observed by @xmath15 is now the vector field @xmath41 on @xmath42 . in strict formal language ,",
    "our displacement @xmath40 is a smooth section of the tangent bundle @xmath43 of @xmath24 ( with the projection @xmath44 ) , that is , a smooth map @xmath45 satisfying @xmath46 ( identity on @xmath24 ) .    finally , in preparing to give the formulation on @xmath24 , let us introduce on @xmath24 the metric @xmath47 and the connection @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath50 .",
    "further , the metric @xmath50 is euclidean if and only if @xmath38 is euclidean , because @xmath24 and @xmath1 are of the same dimension .      in the following",
    "we will often work with the category of vector bundles and vector bundle mappings @xcite .",
    "given two vector bundles @xmath51 and @xmath52 over @xmath24 , we denote as @xmath53 the vector bundle whose fiber above point @xmath31 is the vector space @xmath54 of linear maps from the fiber @xmath55 to the fiber @xmath56 .",
    "( for further details , see for example @xcite . )",
    "the ( infinite dimensional ) vector space of ( appropriately smooth ) sections of a vector bundle @xmath51 will be denoted as @xmath57 .    to express small - strain elasticity and magnetism in analogous form",
    ", we bring fore the notion of _ displacement gradient_. intuitively , the displacement gradient serves to describe how the values of displacement are changed to the first order in the neighborhoods of points . to avoid introducing new notation , we will denote the displacement gradient by the symbol @xmath58 , which is usually reserved for strain tensor ( the symmetric part of displacement gradient , see section [ ela_energy_section ] below ) . formally , the displacement gradient is a section of the vector bundle @xmath59 , that is , a vector - valued 1-form on @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , its value at each point @xmath31 belongs to the vector space @xmath60 of linear maps on the tangent space @xmath61 .    to formalize the above intuition about the relation of displacement gradient to displacement , we need to compare the displacement vectors at neighboring points of @xmath24  an operation for which we use the connection @xmath49 on @xmath24 . since @xmath49 takes two smooth vector fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 to a third smooth vector field @xmath64 , which depends linearly on @xmath63 , and is function - linearthat is , the mapping @xmath65 is a structure preserving map on the @xmath66-module of vector fields , where @xmath66 is the ring of smooth real - valued functions on @xmath24 . ] in @xmath62",

    "the relation of displacement gradient @xmath58 to displacement @xmath40 is given as @xmath68    the above relation is invariant to changes of observer , provided that the observed connection is used . by this",
    "we mean the following .",

    "in the present example , magneto - elastic coupling is due merely to magnetic forces ( no magnetostriction ) . also , we consider linear isotropic material behavior . the magneto - elastic energy density is expressed as the sum @xmath484 where the elastic and magnetic energy densities @xmath459 and @xmath460 are defined as follows .",

    "the term @xmath460 is defined independently of @xmath58 , such that @xmath489 where @xmath490 is the reluctivity ( piecewise smooth function , taken here as element of the multiplicative ring of the module of 1-forms ) , and @xmath162 is the hodge operator of 2-forms implied by @xmath50 .",
    "this specifies the observer s measurement of magnetic quantities to the stress - free reference configuration .    for the elastic constitutive law , we have @xmath491 , resulting in @xmath492 where @xmath493 is the identity vector - valued 1-form .",
    "one can verify that this constitutive law gives zero variations @xmath268 of elastic energy density in case @xmath494 is antisymmetric , that is , in case @xmath495 vanishes .",
