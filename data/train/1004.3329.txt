    "our fitting is constrained by an upper limit at august 14.3 ut and the 22-days rise in the rest frame is among the typical range for sne ia @xcite .    given a reliable detection at 17.18@xmath80.08 mag ( corrected for the galactic extinction of 0.21 magnitude in the r - band ) by rotse - iiib on september 5 , sn 2007if , at a redshift 0.0736 ( see @xmath32.3 ) , reached about -20.4 absolute magnitude , without host reddening correction .",
    "this is one magnitude brighter than the average peak brightness of sne ia , even considering the zero - point uncertainty in our r - band calibration . as the supernova color evolves , the characteristic wavelength of the rotse response shifts .",
    "direct comparison with narrow band light curves of other sne ia is thus problematic . we can nevertheless obtain approximate estimates of the characteristic parameters of the sn 2007if light curve . as measured by the rotse detections ,",

    "these defining features of a sn ia become more evident in the spectrum taken just past maximum , at day + 1 .",
    "the lack of o  i @xmath117773 argues against sn 2007if being a type ic .",
    "contributions from si  iii , mg  ii , fe  ii and s  ii can also be identified in the day + 1 spectrum along with a probable trace of c  ii ( see figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_early ] ) . although the c  ii feature is uncertain , it has been detected in other luminous sne ia before or around maximum light @xcite .",
    "shallow si  ii features are usually seen in luminous sne ia ( i.e. the 1991t - like class ) before and around maximum . for sn 2007if ,",
    "the fe signatures are not particularly strong .",
    "the relative strength of fe seems to be between a normal sn ia and a 1991t - like event .",
    "the shallow features may be caused by high temperatures in the outer layers that ionize si  ii and fe  ii @xcite .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_early ] shows that the spectral shape of sn 2007if is similar to that of the pre - maximum sn 2005hk @xcite , which displayed significantly less blueshifted absorptions and was a peculiar sub - luminous event with a high initial temperature .",
    "another probable explanation for shallow features is dilution by an underlying continuum emission .",
    "this prospect will be further discussed in @xmath33 .",
    "the spectroscopic resemblance of sn 2007if to sn 2003fg was pointed out in @xcite , where a spectrum of 2007if taken on sep .",
    "10.5 by the snfactory was reported to closely match that of sn 2003fg at 2 days post - maximum .",
    "we note that at day + 1 , closer to the phase when sn 2003fg was observed , the features have not yet grown to be as strong as seen in sn 2003fg , probably suggesting a even higher temperature or more dilution in sn 2007if .",
    "the expansion velocity measured from the si  ii @xmath116355 absorption minimum at 1 day post - maximum is 8500@xmath8400 km / s .",
    "this photospheric velocity is confirmed if fe  ii @xmath114404 and fe  ii @xmath115129 are mainly responsible for the minima of the other two major absorption features on the blue side . such a velocity , clearly slower than in a typical sn ia ( figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_early ] ) and much slower than for a luminous 1991t - like event , is consistent with that measured for sn 2003fg at a similar epoch around maximum @xcite .",
    "this further strengthens the proposition that sn 2007if is in the same category as 2003fg .",
    "another over - luminous event , sn 2006gz , however , does not have shallow si  ii features and has a typical photospheric velocity .    between day + 15 and day + 70",
    ", the spectral evolution of sn 2007if closely resembles that of a normal sn ia during similar epochs ( e.g. sn 2003du , a normal type ia with good spectroscopic coverage , see figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_late ] ) .",
    "overall , the spectra of sn 2007if have less contrast than those of 2003du .",
    "one remarkable deviation is the weak features from intermediate mass elements in sn 2007if .",
    "the relatively slow si  ii @xmath116355 absorption disappears into a blend with fe  ii lines by day + 29 , while its core is often visible until day + 40 or later for normal sn ia .",
    "the ca  ii ir triplet can be identified at around 8300@xmath10 after day + 15 , but is also considerably weaker than typically observed .",
    "another noticeable difference is at around 4950@xmath10 , where the spectra of sn 2007if appear comparatively flat before day + 20 .",
    "the peak at 4950@xmath10 grows stronger over time and becomes indistinguishable from a typical sn ia by day + 29 .",
    "such a trend , together with the rapidly decreasing blue - to - red peak ratio around 5350@xmath10 , is observed for sn 1994d from 2 to 4 weeks post - maximum ( see figure  7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and was modeled as due to strengthening fe ii and cr ii lines .    the photospheric velocity evolution is not constrained from the si  ii @xmath116355 absorption as it is not resolved in our later observations , but we note that the other absorption minima show similar line velocities to normal events .",
    "the inner layers of the sn 2007if ejecta thus do not necessarily have low kinetic energy .",
    "sn 2007if was observed in the nebular phase by keck on aug . 5 , 2008 .",
    "at day + 339 , the spectrum shows a broad bump on the blue side and a probable broad emission feature just above 7000@xmath10 .",
    "while the general shape of the spectrum is similar to that of other sne ia in nebular phase ( see figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_nebular ] ) , the typical narrow emission features at 4700 and 5300@xmath10 are not as prominent .",
    "these two features are usually modeled as dominated by [ fe iii ] and a combination of [ fe ii ] and [ fe iii ] forbidden lines in the blue and red respectively @xcite . the slightly higher ratio of flux density at these two wavelengths may indicate a somewhat higher temperature in the inner layers of sn 2007if than a normal sn ia .",
    "further quantitative analysis is complicated by the contamination from the host galaxy .",
    "we find that the total sn plus host galaxy flux as observed in the g - band by keck / lris on aug . 4 , 2008 was only 0.4 mag brighter than the host flux alone ( see @xmath32.3 ) .",
    "as estimated from the difference , sn 2007if was at about 23.9@xmath80.4 mag in g - band .",
    "as for the featureless pre - maximum spectra , dilution by an additional continuum may also play a role .",
    "a similarly featureless nebular spectrum in the blue region was observed for over - luminous sn 2006gz @xcite .",
    "however , in the latter case , relatively strong emission was detected at @xmath17200 - 7300@xmath10 ( probably due to [ ca ii ] ) , indicating yet different composition and conditions .",
    "the host of sn 2007if was imaged by keck on june 26.6 , 2009 , long after the sn had faded away .",
    "an r - band magnitude of 22.70@xmath80.08 and g magnitude of 23.03@xmath80.13 ( corrected for galactic extinction ) were estimated by calibrating to the sdss measurements of nearby objects .",
    "based on the g - r color , the host of sn 2007if is among the bluest objects within the 3  neighborhood .",
    "a spectrum of the host was also obtained by keck on july 20.6 , 2009 . because of the faintness of the host , the spectrum was dominated by sky emissions . after removing the sky lines ,",
    "a single emission feature was identified as h@xmath12 at redshift 0.0736 ( figure  [ fig:2007if_host_2d ] ) .",
    "this redshift is fully consistent with the estimation from cross - correlating the spectra with templates in snid @xcite .",
    "we therefore adopt this as the redshift of sn 2007if .    at the measured redshift",
    ", the host has an absolute r magnitude of -14.91 .",
    "the host spectrum is best - matched by an sb3 - sb4 galaxy template at redshift 0.07 using `` superfit '' @xcite , but the h@xmath12 emission , indicative of massive stars and recent star formation activity , is much weaker than that in the template ( see figure  [ fig:2007if_host_keck07 ] and the inset ) .",
    "if the supernova light curve is entirely powered by radioactive decay of @xmath2ni , the luminosity of the supernova at maximum light would roughly equal the instantaneous energy deposition from @xmath2ni .",
    "the peak brightness of the supernova thus provides an estimate of the amount of @xmath2ni synthesized in the explosion @xcite .",
    "a precise estimate of the bolometric luminosity is not possible without multi - band photometry . since the observed evolution is quite similar for sn 2007if and a normal brightness sn ia , we can simply scale its @xmath2ni production with the peak luminosity . at",
    "one magnitude brighter than average , sn 2007if would require about 1.5  of @xmath2ni compared to a typical 0.6  .",
    "if the weak features from intermediate mass elements indicate a more complete burning , the total mass requirement is less extreme .",
    "a larger fraction of @xmath2ni production is consistent with a trend suggested by modeling of the nearby `` normal '' sne ia @xcite . even considering the large uncertainty associated with such an estimate ,",
    "the amount of @xmath2ni is far beyond that which can be synthesized in a 1.4  white dwarf progenitor .",
    "@xcite discussed a large progenitor mass and hence a large binding energy as the explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the exceptional brightness and a low photospheric velocity of sn 2003fg .",
    "a similar situation is noticed for sn 2007if .",
    "in addition , we observe shallow features in the early spectra , suggesting high ionization and high temperature . at later times",
    ", the spectral evolution of sn 2007if follows that of a typical sn ia , indicating similar physical processes .    despite the resemblance to sn 2003fg ,",
    "the spectra of sn 2007if clearly differ from that of another ultra - luminous sn ia with a proposed super - chandrasekhar progenitor , 2006gz ( figure  [ fig:2007if_spectra_early ] ) . for the latter case ,",
    "prominent narrow absorption features were observed from 2 weeks before maximum light . @xcite investigated the different properties between sn 2003fg and 2006gz , and suggested that they might be from the same type of progenitor but observed at different angles .",
    "they propose that the shallow spectral features can be explained as due to less shocked material at the pole .",
    "however , polarimetric observations of a recent luminous sn ia , 2009dc , which has similar observational features as sn 2003fg , do not support the aspherical explosion hypothesis @xcite .    as an alternative",
    ", we consider the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium ( csm ) that may produce extra luminosity .",
    "detection of a csm signature may provide important clues about the mass transfer process leading to the sn ia explosion .",
    "a csm played a domninant role in sn 2002ic @xcite that had an underlying sn ia spectrum , but a strong ( asymmetric ) type iin csm interaction .",
    "sn 2006x @xcite , sn 1999cl @xcite and sn 2007le @xcite showed variable na d lines that indicated the presence of a more dilute csm .",
    "many sn ia show high - velocity ca ii features @xcite that may hint at a csm .",
    "perhaps `` super chandrasekhar '' events reveal excess luminosity from csm interaction .",
    "in such a scenario , the continuum emission above the photosphere produces a `` toplighting '' effect @xcite . as modeled in @xcite , when the external light has comparable intensity as the photospheric emission , the spectral features are strongly `` muted . ''",
    "the shallow features observed in sn 2007if could then be a consequence of luminous emission from circumstellar interaction , roughly doubling the total luminosity .",
    "it is potentially possible that deceleration by the reverse shock results in shifted absorption minima and apparently low photospheric velocity .",
    "any csm interaction must satisfy the constraint that narrow emission lines are not observed in sn 2007if .",
    "in addition , any csm can not correspond to a steady - state wind since an r@xmath13 density profile would generate substantial luminosity at early times and alter the light curve in a manner that is not observed ( see e.  g. fig .  5 in * ? ? ?",
    "such a csm might be reminiscent of the expanding gas identified in novae by @xcite or a common envelope in a dd model @xcite .",
    "it is not clear how the interaction can be fine tuned to make a contribution comparable to the nuclear decay throughout the sn evolution .",
    "modeling of the exact distribution of the csm and the propagation of forward / reverse shocks is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "after our paper was submitted , we became aware of the independent analysis of @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate a similar @xmath2ni mass from the bolometric light curve and argue the low photospheric velocity is a likely result of the interaction between the ejecta and an massive envelope surrounding a double - degenerate progenitor .",
    "sn 2007if was one of the first discoveries of the rotse supernova verification project ( rsvp ) @xcite , which extends the efforts of the texas supernova search ( tss , @xcite ) and uses all four rotse - iii telescopes .",
    "the peak unfiltered magnitude of sn 2007if ( calibrated to sdss r - band ) measured by rotse - iiib , corresponds to an absolute magnitude of -20.4 at redshift 0.074 .",
    "this is by far the brightest sn ia observed .",
    "if powered by @xmath2ni decay , the exceptional brightness of sn 2007if requires a total @xmath2ni mass close to or even exceeding the chandrasekhar mass of a non - rotating white dwarf .",
    "the photospheric expansion velocity derived around maximum is comparable to the estimate for sn 2003fg and suggests a relatively low kinetic energy .",
    "after two weeks post - maximum , the spectral evolution of sn 2007if become indistinguishable from a normal sn ia , except for `` muted '' features and weak absorptions due to si and ca .",
    "late time observations show that sn 2007if occured in a low luminosity host , similar to that of sn 2003fg .",
    "the observed properties of sn 2007if may suggest that it had a massive progenitor , well above 1.4  , as proposed for a few other luminous sne ia .",
    "super - chandrasekhar explosions have been investigated for systems with rapid rotations @xcite . both a single wd or a merger of two degenerate stars can sustain a larger mass if rapidly rotating .",
    "csm interaction may provide another interpretation for the excess luminosity . in the presence of such emission above the photosphere , shallow spectral features",
    "are predicted , consistent with our observation of sn 2007if .",
    "however , it is noted that the spectra of other luminous sne , such as 2003fg and 2006gz are not similarly `` muted . ''",
    "further studies are needed to see whether the observed light curve can be reproduced .",
    "so far , the few most luminous sne ia show diverse behaviors . in general",
    ", the events follow a positive correlation between peak brightness and stretch factor , except for sn 2003fg @xcite , which was among the brightest but showed a relatively fast decay .",
    "sn 2009dc @xcite and 2007if had similarly slow photospheric velocity derived from si  ii 6355 as for sn 2003fg .",
    "sn 2006gz @xcite and 2004gu @xcite appear as close cousins , with relatively high photospheric velocity .",
    "suppression of the silicon velocity was also noticed at early times for sn 2006gz @xcite .",
    "although rare , over - luminous sne ia show significant deviations in brightness when the normal parametrization method is applied in cosmological studies @xcite . more luminous events , polarimetric observations , x - ray monitoring and detailed simulations in the future may help to understand the category as a whole .",
