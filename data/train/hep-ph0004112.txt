    "the radiative decays of mesons and baryons are an interesting source of important information for hadron spectroscopy and hadron electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "for example , it is worth recalling the role of such decays in determining the charmonium spectrum@xcite . among radiative decays , especially intriguing are those where lepton pairs are produced .",
    "a classical example is the process @xmath9 @xcite , which is sensitive to the radius of the corresponding form factor .",
    "such a decay is typical of any neutral pseudoscalar meson @xmath10 (= @xmath11 , etc . ) : @xmath12 the corresponding transition electromagnetic form factors of @xmath13-decay are complex functions of @xmath14 , the four - momentum transfer squared , in the time - like region @xmath15 , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the mass of @xmath10 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "in particular the decay @xmath0 offers the possibility of studying the transition form factor in a relatively large region of time - like momentum transfer , @xmath19 a strong theoretical interest in the transition form factors of pseudoscalar mesons was stimulated by the experimental results of the cleo collaboration @xcite , which measured these form factors at space - like momentum transfers , using the well known 2@xmath20-exchange mechanism in the reaction @xmath21 ( fig .",
    "if one lepton , say the positron , is not detected , we can study the process of photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons on electrons , @xmath22 , in an unusual kinematics of colliding particles , @xmath20 and @xmath23 . in the case of @xmath24 production",
    "the corresponding form factor was measured up to @xmath25 gev@xmath26 , where , in principle , perturbative qcd applies@xcite .",
    "recently also the @xmath27 transition form factor has been determined@xcite for two different values of @xmath14 in the spacelike region .",
    "a special interest has the decay @xmath28 , as a generalisation of the decay @xmath29 , whose branching ratio is known@xcite ( see also predictions by dispersive methods@xcite ) .",
    "the availability of a form factor instead of a single constant , as in the case of @xmath30 decay , allows a better insight of the structure of the @xmath31-meson and of perturbative qcd .",
    "it is also interesting to look at the predictions of the `` old '' approach of vector dominance model ( vdm ) in the unusual region of charmed particle decays@xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to a global approach to the study of all possible crossed channels , i. e. , @xmath32 whose characteristics are driven by a single transition form factor . the numerical estimates are performed both within vdm and qcd , considering , in the latter case , the process @xmath7 as the basic mechanism generating the @xmath33 transition form factor .",
    "section ii is dedicated to the dalitz plot distribution of the decay @xmath0 . in sect .",
    "iii we propose two models for calculating the transition form factor @xmath34 , one based on vdm and the other on qcd . in sect .",
    "iv we study the reaction @xmath35 .",
    "v is dedicated to the process @xmath36 .",
    "lastly in sect .",
    "vi we draw some conclusions .",
    "we start by considering the more general case of the decay of a meson @xmath38 into a real @xmath20 and a lepton pair .",
    "the differential decay width reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the energies of the final @xmath20 , @xmath43 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "the notation of the four - momenta is shown in fig .",
    "2 ; the line above the modulus squared of the matrix element @xmath44 denotes the sum over the polarisations of all the particles produced in the decay .",
    "the standard form of the matrix element @xmath45 for the @xmath46 decay in one - photon approximation is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the effective mass squared of the leptonic pair , @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the electromagnetic current in the decay @xmath51 .",
    "is proportional to the electric charge @xmath52 . ]",
    "according to the usual notation we obtain @xmath53 where @xmath54 substituting ( [ modsq ] ) into ( [ dalitz11 ] ) , and integrating over all variables except @xmath55 , we get the two - lepton dalitz distribution : @xmath56 where @xmath57 = @xmath58 .",
    "however for our aims it is more convenient to express @xmath41 and @xmath42 in terms of the dimensionless variables @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite , which are defined in the ranges @xmath61 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore we take into account , wherever possible , symmetry properties :    * gauge invariance - @xmath65=@xmath66=@xmath67 - implies that the product @xmath68 can be rewritten in terms of the space components of the two tensors above , i. e. , @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the energy of the @xmath4 .",
    "here we have adopted a reference frame in which the meson @xmath38 is at rest and the @xmath71axis is parallel to the momentum @xmath72 of the virtual photon . *",
    "parity invariance allows to write @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the real structure function ( sf ) which describes the production of @xmath4 with transverse ( longitudinal ) polarisation .",
    "taking into account all that , calculations yield @xmath75,\\ ] ] @xmath76    one can see that the differential width , which characterises the dalitz distribution for the decay @xmath77 , is symmetric with respect to the exchange @xmath78 , in agreement with @xmath79-invariance of the electromagnetic interaction .",
    "the specific dependence of @xmath80 on the variable @xmath81 , @xmath82 is a direct consequence of one - photon mechanism .",
    "it has the same origin as the @xmath83 dependence of the differential cross section in electron - hadron scattering ( where @xmath84 is the electron scattering angle in the laboratory system ) and as the @xmath85-dependence of the differential cross section for the inclusive process @xmath86 , where @xmath87 denotes the final detected hadron and @xmath88 is the angle between the three - momenta of the hadron and of the electron in the overall cms .",
    "one can see that the value @xmath89 determines the probability of the radiative decay width @xmath90 , i.e. , @xmath91 this allows to rewrite the dalitz distribution in the following form : @xmath92 , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the study of the energy distribution of leptons in @xmath95 in the dalitz plane allows to determine @xmath94 and @xmath96 , i. e. , the two fundamental quantities of the decay considered , as functions of the effective mass of the @xmath97-system .",
    "the result of the integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) over the variable @xmath81 determines the @xmath97 effective mass spectrum in the decay @xmath98 @xcite : @xmath99.\\ ] ]    turning to the specific decay @xmath100 , in this case ( and more generally for any neutral pseudoscalar meson ) the hadron electromagnetic current reads    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the polarisation four - vector of the real photon and @xmath103 the electromagnetic form factor of the transition @xmath104 , which has a nonzero imaginary part for @xmath105 .",
    "note that we have defined the form factor differently from lepage and brodsky@xcite .",
    "inserting eq .",
    "( [ etaci ] ) into the definition of the tensor @xmath106 , eq . ( [ tensor ] ) , we obtain @xmath107 i.e. @xmath108    there are three different processes for studying the @xmath109dependence of @xmath110 :    1 .   the photoproduction of @xmath31 in @xmath111 at space - like momentum transfers ; 2 .   the decay @xmath112 , at time - like momentum transfers , @xmath113 ; 3 .   the reaction @xmath114 , at time - like momentum transfers , @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the simultaneous study of all these different processes can allow to determine the @xmath109dependence of the electromagnetic form factor @xmath103 for any value of @xmath14 ( see fig .",
    "moreover all the possible observables in the above mentioned processes depend only on @xmath116 .",
    "this means that the phase of @xmath103 in the time - like region can not be measured .",
    "but the determination of this phase as a function of @xmath14 is very important .",
    "for example , a dispersion relation for the form factor @xmath103 , considered as an analytical function of @xmath14 , can be analysed only if both the modulus and the phase of @xmath103 are known .",
    "the problem of measuring the phase of complex form factors of hadrons in the time - like region is not yet solved .",
    "this is a common problem of the electromagnetic form factor of the charged pion , of the neutral and charged kaons , etc ..    the determination of the transition form factor @xmath103 is necessary for calculating the following observables :    * the dalitz - distribution in the variables @xmath117 and @xmath81 ; * the spectrum of the effective masses in @xmath112 ; * the coefficient of internal conversion , i.e. the ratio of the decay width of @xmath118 to the decay width of @xmath119 : @xmath120    this coefficient derives its main contribution from small values of @xmath14 , therefore it is sensitive to the mass of the lepton , in particular it is different in the decays @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "now we consider the predictions of two models , the vdm and a pqcd - inspired non - relativistic model .      in the framework of vdm ( fig .",
    "4 ) , the @xmath109dependence of the electromagnetic form factor @xmath103 can be written as @xmath124 having summed over the contributions of the vector mesons .",
    "@xmath125 is the vector meson mass , @xmath126 is the constant of the @xmath127-transition and @xmath128 is the constant in the vertex @xmath129 . if @xmath130 , the decay @xmath131 is possible and the corresponding branching ratio allows to determine the constant @xmath132 , or , more exactly , as previously discussed , the modulus of this constant .",
    "incidentally , notice that the constant @xmath126 determines the decay width of @xmath133 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the constants @xmath134 satisfy two important conditions : @xmath135 the first one is a relation between different @xmath134 , through an evident normalisation of @xmath103 .",
    "the constant @xmath136 can be determined from the decay width of @xmath137 , i.e. , from @xmath138 which is experimentally known .",
    "again , the value of the width @xmath139 does not fix the sign of @xmath140 , which introduces a two - fold ambiguity in relation ( [ r1 ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ r2 ] ) results from a specific asymptotic behaviour of @xmath103 : the structure of the current @xmath141 shows that @xmath142 for large @xmath143 .",
    "this differs from the standard @xmath144 behaviour of the elastic electromagnetic form factors of mesons , however it agrees with the quark counting rule , and it results from the presence in eq .",
    "( 8) of an additional four - momentum , owing to the electromagnetic current of the decay considered .    the simplest model that can be suggested here for @xmath103 must contain the contribution of two vector mesons .",
    "the problem is how to select the most important contributions .",
    "taking into account the @xmath145-nature of @xmath31 , the @xmath146 seems to be a good candidate , as confirmed by the value of the branching ratio @xmath147 .",
    "similarly the branching ratio @xmath148 exhibits the importance of the @xmath149-contribution to the form factor @xmath103 .",
    "therefore in such a two - pole model we find the following two parametrisations : @xmath150 which can not be disentangled in the study of the above mentioned processes .    in order to avoid singularities at @xmath14=@xmath151",
    ", we have to substitute @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the width of the @xmath154meson ( @xmath155 = @xmath149 , @xmath146 ) .",
    "these parametrisations offer a numerical estimation of all the observables of the @xmath31 photoproduction on electrons , @xmath156 , and of the decay @xmath0 , where @xmath157 . in both processes",
    "the @xmath149-contribution is particularly important at relatively small momentum transfers , @xmath158 gev@xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath146-contribution plays an important role in the decay @xmath0 , near the upper kinematical limit in the variable @xmath14 , @xmath159 , where the @xmath146-pole is very close to the physical region .    on the other hand",
    "this simplified parametrisation is not convenient for the study of the annihilation process , @xmath160 , to which the entire set of @xmath161-resonances in principle could contribute . in this case formula ( [ pole ] )",
    "has to be generalised , taking into account , at least ,    * the contribution of additional @xmath161 resonances ; * the widths of such resonances , as illustrated above .    in the framework of vdm it is in principle possible to write a five - pole representation for @xmath103 , with the contributions of @xmath162",
    "the constants @xmath134 of @xmath163 and @xmath164 can be found using the existing experimental data about the radiative decays : @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the details of the calculation are given in the appendix .",
    "on the other hand , using relations ( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) , it is possible to find the constants @xmath134 of the @xmath171 and the @xmath172-resonances . as two choices",
    "are possible for the sign of @xmath140 and for the constants @xmath134 for the first three resonances , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , one finds a @xmath173-fold parametrisation for @xmath103 , which prevents any realistic estimation of the @xmath109behaviour of the cross section for the process @xmath2 .",
    "so our prediction of the various characteristics of the decay @xmath174 will be based on the simplified two - pole model for @xmath103 .",
    "now we consider the process of @xmath145-quark annihilation into @xmath175 , which receives the contribution of the two diagrams illustrated in fig .",
    "5 .    in the limit of @xmath176 ( where @xmath177 is the relative momentum of the @xmath145-system in the cms ) , the @xmath145- annihilation in a singlet @xmath178-state - which has the quantum numbers of the @xmath31-meson , @xmath179 - is described by a matrix element of the form @xmath180 where @xmath181 ( @xmath182 ) is the polarisation vector of the real ( virtual ) photon .",
    "the following relations hold : @xmath183 and @xmath184 . the result ( [ pedro ] )",
    "can be found , without specific calculations , on the basis of symmetry properties relative to @xmath185 and @xmath186transformations for the process @xmath187 . due to the positive @xmath185parity of the two final @xmath20 s",
    ", the sum of the total spin @xmath178 and the angular momentum @xmath18 of the ( @xmath145)-system must be even .",
    "but in the limit of @xmath188 we have @xmath18 = 0 , therefore @xmath189 . in this limit the @xmath109dependence of the resulting matrix element for @xmath190 can be identified with the @xmath109dependence of the form factor @xmath103 of the decay @xmath191 .",
    "this dependence can be written in terms of the @xmath192quark propagators in the elementary process @xmath193 , which are identical for both diagrams of fig .",
    "5 . therefore in the limit of @xmath194 we have @xmath195 which implies that @xmath103 @xmath196 @xmath144 for large @xmath143 , unlike the vdm .    the parameter @xmath197 which appears in the denominator",
    "should be identified with a physical quantity .",
    "the simplest possibility is to set @xmath198 , which corresponds to the @xmath146-contribution to @xmath103 , appearing in the framework of vdm . a perturbative approach , on the basis of a factorisation of short- and long - distance physics @xcite , as considered by feldmann and kroll@xcite in the space - like region , results in @xmath199 where @xmath200 denotes the transverse momentum of the @xmath201-quark in the @xmath31-meson @xcite .",
    "this substitution may be regarded as a possible procedure for taking into account the transverse momentum of the quark inside the meson .",
    "on the other hand , note that our qcd - inspired consideration above is valid for any @xmath14 , both space - like and time - like , except for a small neighbourhood of @xmath14 = @xmath202 .",
    "therefore , if we assume that the substitution ( [ recip ] ) can be extended at least up to @xmath203 , @xmath103 turns out to be very sensitive to @xmath204 near the upper kinematical limit of the dalitz plot , as results from fig .",
    "6 .    in this approach",
    "it is also possible to find the corresponding form factors of the radiative decays @xmath205 of the p - wave charmonium states , @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "to this end it is necessary to find the matrix element of the process @xmath209 ( see fig .",
    "the spin structure of the @xmath210-decay matrix elements is @xmath211 @xmath212 @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the two - component spinor of the @xmath215 ( @xmath201 ) quark .    in the general case",
    "the decays of @xmath216 and @xmath217 are characterised by one form factor , whereas in the case of @xmath218 three independent form factors are present .",
    "notice also that the matrix element for @xmath219 is proportional to @xmath220 , which vanishes for real photons , in agreement with the landau - yang theorem .    as one can see from fig .",
    "6 , the vdm and qcd - inspired model predict essentially different @xmath109dependences for the transition form factor @xmath103 in the whole region @xmath221 , where the decay @xmath222 occurs .",
    "the coefficients of internal conversion of the decays @xmath121 and @xmath223 are also strongly model - dependent ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these properties of @xmath103 depend essentially on two factors : the role of the @xmath224meson in the vdm approach and the small mass difference between @xmath31 and @xmath146 .",
    "also in the space - like region the two models describe the form factor quite differently ; in particular the qcd - inspired model predicts for @xmath103 a much slower decrease at increasing @xmath143 , in agreement with present data@xcite .",
    "the differential cross section in the overall cms reads @xmath226 where @xmath72 and @xmath227 are the three - momenta of the colliding leptons and of the produced @xmath20 and @xmath48 is the square of the total energy of the colliding particles .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ etaci ] ) , we get @xmath228 the cross section for collinear kinematics ( i.e. @xmath229 or @xmath230 ) is non - vanishing , in agreement with helicity conservation . indeed , in the limit of @xmath231 , owing to the properties of the electromagnetic current @xmath232 ,",
    "we have @xmath233 ; on the other hand for a real @xmath20 we have @xmath234",
    ".    in any process of the type @xmath235 , where @xmath236 and @xmath237 are hadrons or hadronic states , the one - photon mechanism is characterised by a definite angular dependence : @xmath238 where @xmath88 is the production angle of @xmath236 in the overall cms and @xmath239 and @xmath240 are two structure functions which are quadratic combinations of the electromagnetic form factors of the transition @xmath241 . in the case",
    "considered we have only one form factor for the vertex @xmath242 , therefore @xmath243 , as results from the angular dependence ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "the threshold behaviour of the cross section is proportional to @xmath244 and results from the magnetic dipole radiation in the transition @xmath245 .",
    "the factorisation of the @xmath109 and @xmath246-dependences in the differential cross section of @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , is due to the specific structure of the matrix element and to the choice of the cms as a reference frame .",
    "therefore the @xmath109dependence is the same for any production angle and coincides with the @xmath109dependence of the total cross section : @xmath247 formulae ( [ diff ] ) and ( [ tot ] ) can be re - written as @xmath248 latexmath:[\\[\\sigma = \\displaystyle\\frac{4}{3}\\displaystyle\\frac { \\alpha\\pi}{m^3}\\gamma_0\\left(1- \\displaystyle\\frac{m^2}{t}\\right ) ^3\\left     @xmath109dependence of the total and differential cross sections , it is necessary to know the form factor @xmath103 in the region @xmath250 , and especially where the contribution of all the @xmath161-resonances is important . from our previous discussion",

    "we have considered some characteristics of the radiative decay @xmath28 , such as the dalitz distribution with respect to the energies of the two final leptons , the effective mass spectrum of the lepton pair and the coefficient of internal conversion , i.e. the ratio @xmath277 .",
