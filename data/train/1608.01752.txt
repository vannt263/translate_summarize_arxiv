    "in previous works @xcite , we have proposed a curvaton model with a nonminimal derivative coupling ( ndc ) to gravity .",
    "the coupling term takes the form of @xmath0 , with @xmath1 denoting the scalar field and @xmath2 the einstein tensor , which was first proposed by amendola et al . in 1993",
    "this term can not only phenomenologically make the power spectrum of perturbations scale - invariant independent of background evolutions , but also theoretically possesses the nice properties of galileon theories @xcite , such as to keep the equation of motion 2nd order , therefore it has been paid more and more attention in recent works @xcite . in @xcite , we calculated the background as well as both scalar and tensor perturbations generated by this model , and provided several constraints on parameters considering its transfer to the curvature perturbations . in @xcite we investigated the full types of non - gaussianities up to the 3-rd order .",
    "both these works has been focusing on the stages when inflation is going on .    in this paper",
    "we consider another region , namely the reheating process after the end of inflation .",
    "reheating is a very important region in the evolution of the universe , for it explains how particles and light elements can be generated , after the dilution of the inflation .",
    "the oldest discussions of reheating can be persued to the last dacades of last century , see @xcite for original ideas and see @xcite where the great breakthrough of parametric resonance mechanism was proposed for effecient reheating of single field inflation . as more and more models for early universe come out , more and more reheating mechanisms are also proposed , such as geometric reheating @xcite , curvaton reheating @xcite , modulated reheating @xcite , bounce reheating @xcite , and so on . moreover , recently there has been some discussions on the reheating mechanism for the inflaton with such non - minimal derivative coupling ( ndc ) terms @xcite .",
    "these works raised a couple of questions and discussions about reheating in such models , which is interesting and related to the topic of this paper . for reviews on reheating mechanisms ,",
    "see @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will investigate in detail the reheating process caused by the ndc curvaton model .",
    "we will mainly focus on the following questions : + @xmath3 _ how will the curvaton evolve after the end of inflation ? _",
    "+ @xmath3 _ can it give efficient mechanism for particle creation ( namely , does parametric resonance exist ) ? _ + @xmath3 _ how is the reheating temperature constrained ? _",
    "+ @xmath3 _ how will the curvature perturbation be affected by reheating process ? _ + our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the ndc curvaton model . in sec .",
    "iii we study the reheating process of our model . in sec .",
    "iiia we show the background evolution both before and after curvaton domination , in sec .",
    "iiib we study the process of parametric resonance , and in sec .",
    "iiic we estimate the reheating temperature . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss about the evolution of curvature perturbation in reheating process .",
    "v comes the conclusion .",
    "following the preceding work @xcite , one has the action of ndc curvaton as [ action ] = ^4x  , where @xmath4 is the dimensionless coupling constant of the ndc term .",
    "it is straightforward to write down the equation of motion for the curvaton field @xmath1 , such as [ eom ] h^2+(2 + 3h^2)h+v_=0  , and its energy density and pressure can be expressed as [ rho ] _ & = & h^2 ^ 2+v ( )  , + [ p ] p_&=&-(3h^2 ^ 2 + 2h^2 + 4h)-v ( )  , respectively .",
    "the background evolution of the curvaton field with various types of potential as well as the linear perturbations during inflation has been classified and briefly analyzed in @xcite . as has been shown there ,",
    "if the curvaton field is massless , namely @xmath5 , exactly scale - invariant power spectrum will be obtained due to the nonminimally kinetic coupling . however , since exact scale - invariance is not favored by today s data , a non - zero potential is needed which could give a mass term to @xmath1 . in this case , according to @xcite , we will receive a deviation of the spectral index from the scale - invariance for the amount of @xmath6 , where the hubble parameter @xmath7 is nearly a constant during inflation .. ] therefore , for the simplest choice , we choose [ potential ] v()=m^2 ^ 2   as its potential , and one can therefore constrain the mass to be [ meff ] |m_inf~0.1h_inf  .",
    "in order to investigate the reheating mechanism of the curvaton field @xmath1 , let s assume that after the inflation ends , the background field ( inflaton ) decays rapidly without oscillation .",
    "a typical example is that the inflaton field is a canonical scalar field dominated by its kinetic energy , such as the so - called",
    " quintessential inflation \" @xcite .",
    "therefore one has _",
    "bga^-6(t )  ,  w_bg=1  .",
    "however , as the curvaton field has a potential ( [ potential ] ) , it will fall down and oscillate around its minimum , and if the energy density of curvaton decrease slower than that of inflaton , the curvaton can dominate the universe , unless it reheats before domination .",
    "first of all , one can determine the averaged equation of state during its oscillation , which will be used for later analysis . to do this , one can parametrize the scale factor @xmath8 and hubble parameter @xmath9 during the rapid deflation of the universe .",
    "one can have : [ parah ] a(t)~t^p  ,  h(t)=  ,  p  , and @xmath10 should be equal to @xmath11 before curvaton domination , and @xmath12 after that . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath13 as the time when the energy densities of inflaton and curvaton are equal . for the former case , @xmath14 as @xmath15 , while the latter case depends on the behavior of @xmath1 which is the solution of the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) . considering ( [ parah ] ) , eq . ( [ eom ] ) can be solved as : [ varphisol ] = ( t ) ( )  , where @xmath16 is the oscillation amplitude of @xmath1 with the initial condition of @xmath17 . during rapid oscillation , the kinetic and potential terms in the energy density ( [ rho ] ) are of the same order , therefore one roughly has [ rhooft ] _ ~(t)^2t^1 - 3p  . for @xmath18 , @xmath14 , so we have @xmath19 .",
    "this means that before curvaton domination , the energy density of curvaton field will behave as a constant , giving its equation of motion to be @xmath20 .",
    "since the background energy density is decreasing , the curvaton will exceed the background ( at the time @xmath13 ) and dominate the universe .",
    "for @xmath21 , the same solution of ( [ varphisol ] ) applied but with @xmath22 be related to @xmath12 , so one can not determine @xmath22 , or the behavior of @xmath23 , solely by the relation ( [ rhooft ] ) .",
    "however , since the curvaton dominates the universe , we have another equation , namely the friedmann equation , h^2= _  ,",
    "this equation , together with ( [ parah ] ) , tells us that @xmath24 . comparing it with eq .",
    "( [ rhooft ] ) , one gets @xmath25 , which gives @xmath26 .    in order to confirm our analysis , we performed numerical calculations for both the two cases .",
    "one can see that in fig .",
    "[ plot1 ] , both the field value @xmath1 and its energy density @xmath23 oscillate with a stabe amplitude , giving a constant averaged value . however , in fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] , the field value oscillates with a damping amplitude . the hubble parameter is therefore also oscillating , so the value of @xmath22 is also an oscillating function with its averaged value @xmath27 . from the figure",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath28 is at the position of about unity .     and its energy density @xmath23 in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 .",
    "we choose the parameters as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   and its energy density @xmath23 in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   and its energy density @xmath23 in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 .",
    "we choose the parameters as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as a side remark , we remind the reader that our result is different from that for minimal coupling curvatons @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "if the curvaton oscillates ( let s still take a mass - squared potential for curvaton as an example ) , the solution of curvaton will be as @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , accordingly .",
    "one can see that , no matter what value @xmath22 will be given , or no matter whether curvaton is dominant or not , the curvaton will behave like an ordinary matter , with @xmath35 averagely , as long as the mass - squared potential is applied .",
    "this means the energy density will evolve synchronically with the scale factor , in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite .",
    "however when curvaton is nonminimally coupled , this synchronicity will be violated , and the behavior before and after domination will be different .",
    "as will be seen later , this different will directly cause the different rate of particle creation . to our knowledge , this has not been given much notice in previous studies .",
    "in this section , we begin to discuss about how the oscillating behavior of the curvaton @xmath1 , as shown above , can be responsible for creating particles ( we denote as @xmath36 ) , namely , the preheating process .",
    "one assume the free - field lagrangian of @xmath36 has a canonical form , and that @xmath1 can interact with @xmath36 through some interacting term , such as @xmath37 , with a dimensionless coefficient of @xmath38 .",
    "it gives the total form of lagrangian of @xmath36 field as : [ lagrangianchi ] l_=-_^-m_^2-g^2 ^ 2  .",
    "it is true that one can also have the interaction term of @xmath36 and the background field ( the inflaton ) , however here we drop this out for simplicity .",
    "actually , as the inflaton decays quickly after inflation ends , it will have much less effects on @xmath36 than @xmath1 . since @xmath36 is a quantum field",
    ", one can write down the heisenberg presentation of @xmath36 as @xcite : [ heisenbergchi ] ( t,)=d^3k(_k_k(t)e^-i+_k^_k^(t)e^i ) where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the annihilation and creation operators respectively , and @xmath41 is the comoving wavenumber . using this , one can also get the equation of motion for @xmath36 by simply varying the lagrangian ( [ lagrangianchi ] ) : [ eomchi ] _",
    "k+3h_k+(+m_^2+g^2)_k=0  .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we assume @xmath42 for simplicity .    since in our case",
    ", @xmath43 behaves as in eq .",
    "( [ varphisol ] ) , in the static limit where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , eq .",
    "( [ eomchi ] ) will reduce to the mathieu - like equation , the solution of which is the well - known floquet solution @xcite . in expanding phase such as inflation ,",
    "however , one can define a new variable : @xmath46 , and eq .",
    "( [ eomchi ] ) can be rewritten as : [ eomx ] & & x_k+_k^2x_k=0  , + & & _ k^2+^2()-h - h^2  .",
    "one can apply the wkb approximation to get the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eomx ] ) : [ solx ] x_k(t)=e^-i^t_kdt+e^i^t_kdt  , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 being the time - dependent coefficient of positive and negative frequency parts , respectively .",
    "moreover , the @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfy the equations : [ eomalphabeta ] _",
    "k = e^2i^t_kdt_k  ,  _ k = e^-2i^t_kdt_k   with additional normalization relation [ norm ] |_k|^2-|_k|^2=1  .",
    "furthermore , the comoving occupation number of @xmath36 particles in the mode @xmath41 is defined by n_k(+|x_k|^2)-  , using eq.s ( [ solx ] ) , ( [ eomalphabeta ] ) and ( [ norm ] ) , one get a simple expression of @xmath49 , and the vacuum expectation value of particle number density of @xmath36 per comoving volume is : n__0^n_k=_0^dk k^2|_k|^2  .",
    "it is straightfoward to know how the @xmath36 particles increase with time just by integrating @xmath50 , which is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eomalphabeta ] ) .",
    "however , it is rather difficult , if not impossible , to have analytical solution of ( [ eomalphabeta ] ) due to the complication of the dispersion relation in ( [ solx ] ) . in order to solve the problem , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a method , that is , to consider the solution of each period around the time point at which the source field of particle creation is zero , namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 where @xmath53 in our case .",
    "this is because that only around @xmath51 the particle number can be dramatically changed .",
    "if we taylor expand the function @xmath54 with @xmath1 given in ( [ varphisol ] ) around @xmath51 , we can get : g^2(t)=g(t - t_j)^2+o(t - t_j)^3  .",
    "so the leading order of @xmath54 gives a parabolic potential for @xmath36 , and the particle creation at @xmath51 could be viewed as the scattering of @xmath36 particles through this potential for the @xmath55-th time .",
    "we assume the solution of @xmath56 at the period of @xmath57 is x^j_k(t)=e^-i^t_kdt+e^-i^t_kdt  , with @xmath58 and @xmath59 approximately constants .",
    "following @xcite and noticing the relation of @xmath60 , one can get a recursive relation of @xmath61 and @xmath62 as : n_k^j+1=n_k^je^2_k^j with @xmath63 , where the ellipsis denotes the random ( stochastic ) terms . here",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 . in @xcite",
    ", @xmath66 is independent on @xmath51 , but as is mentioned before , in our case there are two differences .",
    "one is that @xmath22 does not have the same value before and after curvaton domination , and the other is that the scaling of @xmath1 on @xmath51 is different from the minimal coupling case , as was shown in ( [ varphisol ] ) .",
    "these causes @xmath67 for @xmath68 , while @xmath69 for @xmath21 . considering also the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath29 , namely @xmath71 before @xmath13 and @xmath72",
    "after , one gets @xmath73 before @xmath13 and @xmath74 after .",
    "therefore one gets : [ mu ] _ k^j&&(1 + 2e^-+ ... )  , + _ k^j&&(1 + 2e^-+ ... )  . in the limit of @xmath75",
    ", @xmath76 reduces to the trivial case in @xcite : @xmath77 where we neglected the ramdom terms .",
    "the total number during the whole process of resonance yields n_k = e^2_j_k^je^2m^tdt_k(t )  , in mode @xmath41 . in principle one can get @xmath78 by integrating @xmath76 according to the expressions ( [ mu ] ) , however unfortunately it might not be analytical , so we will refer to numerical calculations later on . the particle number density in real space is : n_&=&_0^dk k^2n_k + & ~ &  .",
    "+ & ~ &  .    in fig.s [ plot3 ] and [ plot4 ] we numerically calculated the creation of particles before and after curvaton domination , and plot the values of @xmath56 and @xmath78 in terms of @xmath29 .",
    "the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis . in our plot",
    "we can see that in both cases @xmath56 oscillates rapidly due to the parametric resonance , and with the amplitude get higher and higher .",
    "the number density @xmath78 of both cases increase rapidly , though in some instances it decreases , due to the stochastic random process .",
    "nevertheless , one can see that the shapes as well as the increasing rates of @xmath56 and @xmath78 in the two cases are different , which is due to the different behavior of the source field @xmath1 before and after curvaton domination .     and @xmath78 in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 before curvaton domination .",
    "we choose the parameters as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath79 .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath78 in terms of cosmic time @xmath29 before curvaton domination .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      when reheating process completed , the curvaton will decay into the relativistic products , which scales as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the temperature . therefore the reheating temperature will be related to the final state of the curvaton field .",
    "knowing the initial state of the curvaton field at where inflation has just ended , and the scaling of the curvaton field during reheating , one can estimate the reheating temperature and compare it to various data constraints .",
    "this procedure is initially done for normal curvaton mechanism given in @xcite .",
    "now we also use this method to estimate the reheating temperature in our model .",
    "the curvaton may reheat the universe in two ways . since we know from above that the energy density of curvaton scales as @xmath83 before domination",
    ", we have : [ rhophieq ] _",
    "^osc_^eq   where the subscripts @xmath84 and @xmath85 denotes the value when @xmath1 begins to oscillate and when it has the same amount of energy density with background , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , at the time when reheating completes we have : [ rhophirh ] _ ^rh = t_rh^4  . therefore ,",
    "if the curvaton reheats after its domination , then we have @xmath86 , and the amount of difference depends on how long reheating will last after curvaton domination . from eq.s ( [ rhophieq ] ) and ( [ rhophirh ] ) we have : [ trh ] t_rh<(_^osc)^  .    at the time when @xmath1 ends slow - rolling and begins oscillating , the kinetic and potential term of @xmath1 will be of the same order , namely @xmath87 , therefore [ rhophiosc ] _ ^osch^2 ^ 2=18h_osc^2y_osc  , where @xmath88 is the value of @xmath89 at the oscillation time .",
    "so the reheating temperature is : [ trh2 ] t_rh<()^  .",
    "the constraints on the hubble parameter and @xmath90 can be obtained from the planck constraints on scalar spectrum : @xmath91 ( tt , te , ee+lowp , @xmath92 cl ) and the tensor / scalar ratio : @xmath93 ( tt , te , ee+lowp , @xmath94 cl ) @xcite . in our model , from @xcite we have : _  ,  p_t  . for this case .",
    "these first give the constraints : [ constrainti ] 210 ^ 3  ,  h_*10 ^ -5m_p  , from where one can see , if we set @xmath95 , we can get @xmath96 to be as low as @xmath97 . as @xmath90 and @xmath7 varies slowly during inflation , one can roughly have @xmath98 , @xmath99 , therefore the reheating temperature can be set to be : [ trh3 ] t_rh&&0.7210 ^ -4m_p + & & 0.87910 ^ 15  , which actually gives very loose constraint on the reheating temperature , comparing to that from the gravitino producing @xcite .    on the other hand , if curvaton decays and reheats before dominating the universe , one has @xmath100 . from eq.s ( [ rhophirh ] ) , ( [ rhophiosc ] ) , ( [ trh2 ] )",
    "we have : t_rh()^  . for perturbation in this case",

    "we have [ constraintii ]  ,  h_*10 ^ -5m_p  , so we have t_rh0.62310 ^ 15  .which gives a high reheating temperature .",
    "so if the constraints on gravitatino are trustable , then this case will be ruled out .",
    "moreover , one can also constrain some of the parameters for the model , using that on hubble parameter . from eq .",
    "( [ meff ] ) , one has @xmath102 during inflation while @xmath103 when @xmath1 begins to oscillate , which is given by @xmath104 .",
    "since @xmath105 , these two conditions actually do not differ much . from either ( [ constrainti ] ) or",
    "( [ constraintii ] ) , one can get the relation of @xmath106 .",
    "that means , if we choose @xmath107 to be of @xmath108 , we will get @xmath109 , which is consistent with our numerical calculations .",
    "in this section , we discuss about how the resonance process could affect on the final curvature perturbations in our model , especially whether the points of @xmath110 will make the curvature perturbations diverge . this issue has been in debate in early works of canonical inflation reheating @xcite ( see also @xcite for further discussions ) , and has been revisited recently for ndc inflation reheating @xcite . as we know , since there are more than one component in the universe , the perturbations generated by curvaton is basically isocurvature , which will transfer to curvature perturbation after curvaton domination . according to the original analysis on curvaton in @xcite ,",
    "the curvature perturbation is defined as : = -h in spatial flat gauge .",
    "assuming that the perturbations of the background field ( inflaton ) are negligible , we have @xmath111 .    from continuity equations for both components , @xmath112 , we roughly have @xmath113 , @xmath114 . therefore for the time before curvaton dominating ,",

    "( [ rho ] ) , ( [ p ] ) as well as the relation : _ , = = ( 2h^2+hh-3h^3 )  .",
    "so it seems that when @xmath117 passes through @xmath118 during oscillation , @xmath116 might diverge .",
    "however , this is not true . from equation of motion for @xmath119 @xcite : ( az^2)^+az^2-aq_i^2+a^3m_eff^2=0  , where @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , @xmath122 as well as @xmath123 have all been defined in @xcite . making use of ( [ zeta2 ] ) , we have : [ eomzeta ] ( az^2)^()^+az^2()^-aq_i^2+a^3m_eff^2=0  . on the other hand , from eq .",

    "when @xmath110 .",
    "it has the unique solution : @xmath125 .",
    "however , since now the curvaton is dominant , we have @xmath126 , which is equal to zero when @xmath110 .",
    "so we still have @xmath127 , and @xmath116 will not diverge . note that similar conclusion has been obtained in the early work of canonical single field inflation @xcite .",
    "we performed numerical calculations for both the two cases and plot the evolutions of @xmath116 in figs .",
    "[ zetaplot1 ] and [ zetaplot2 ] .",
    "one can see that , in fig .",
    "[ zetaplot1 ] , @xmath116 oscillates with an increasing amplitude .",

    "in this paper , we investigated the reheating mechanism of the curvaton model nonminimally derivative coupled to gravity .",
    "we assume that the curvaton has a mass squared potential term , which can not only explain the observationally required tilt of the perturbation spectrum from scale invariance , but also provide a minimum around which the curvaton can oscillate .",
    "this gives an efficient way of particle creation , namely parametric resonance process .",
    "what is different from the reheating process of inflaton is that , the background evolutions before and after curvaton domination are not the same , and if the curvaton is nonminimally coupled , the averaged decaying rate of curvaton are also not the same , which can affect the rate of particle creation . though we did nt provide a rigid proof ( which will be left for future work ) , this may be a general phenomenon .    for our model ,",
    "as a specific case , we found that the averaged value of curvaton scales as a constant before curvaton domination , while proportional to time inverse after that .",
    "the particles , whose field interacts with the curvaton , will indeed be effectively created due to the resonance process . to confirm our analysis ,",
    "we also numerically calculated the background evolution for the curvaton field and the increase of created particle numbers by the resonance .",
    "moreover , we also estimated the constraints on reheating temperature of our model , for both cases which the reheating completes before and after curvaton domination .",
    "we only got a upper limit on the temperature , which is looser than that given by the overproduction of gravitino . finally , we investigated the curvature perturbation generated in our model .",
    "we showed that the curvature perturbation will be regular , although it is apparently divergent when @xmath117 goes to zero in each oscillation . unlike that the amplitude of curvature perturbation is increasing before curvaton domination , which should be due to the source of isocurvature perturbation , after the curvaton domination it will remain an approximately constant .",
    "one can also investigate the back reaction of the created particle @xmath36 on the reheating process , which we leave for a future study . as an application ,",

    "<S> in this paper , we continue our study on the curvaton model with nonminimal derivative coupling ( ndc ) to einstein gravity proposed in our previous work @xcite , focusing on the reheating mechanism . we found that according to whether the curvaton has dominated the background after the end of inflation , it will have two different behaviors of evolution , which should be the general property of curvaton with nonminimal couplings . </S>",
    "<S> this will cause diffferent rates of particle creation , which goes on via the parametric resonance process . </S>",
    "<S> the reheating temperature is estimated for both cases in which reheating completes before and after curvaton domination , and the constraints are quite loose compared to that of overproduction of gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> finally we investigated the evolution of curvature perturbation during reheating . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown both analytically and numerically that the curvature perturbation will not blow up during the resonance process . </S>"
