    "in a previous work ( @xcite , paper i ) we have developed a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) code to fit the parameters of dark matter ( dm ) models , which are proposed to explain the recent reported abnormal excesses of cosmic ray ( cr ) positrons and electrons by pamela @xcite , atic @xcite , hess @xcite and fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "one assumption adopted in that work is that the dm particles only couple with leptons . to extent",
    "the discussion including hadronic channels will be natural and necessary .",
    "actually the non - excess of pamela @xmath0 data @xcite have been studied in many works to set constraints on the hadronic couplings of dm particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , these studies can only give some illustration constraints on the model parameters instead of a full scan of the possible parameter space .",
    "our mcmc fitting scheme makes it possible to fully scan the high - dimensional parameter space and derive the model - independent constraints from the data directly .    shortly after the proposal of using dm annihilation to account for the data ,",
    "the accompanied @xmath5-ray and radio emission are investigated as constraint and/or future probe of the current models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides the photon emission , neutrino can also be regarded as an another probe to test the dm interpretation of the data @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that antares and icecube are promising to detect the neutrino signals of dm annihilation in the galactic center ( gc ) or the massive subhalo for models to explain pamela and atic data , assuming an nfw profile @xcite of dm spatial distribution .",
    "it is also claimed that for annihilation dm scenario the icecube / deepcore detector can explore much of the parameter space to explain the pamela and fermi - lat @xmath6 data , still for an nfw profile @xcite . for decaying dm scenario icecube / deepcore",
    "also has the potential to exclude some of the parameter space , depending on the final states and dm profile @xcite . in all of these works ,",
    "the expectation of neutrino signals will strongly depend on the annihilation / decay final states and dm profile , and the constraints from various kinds of data are not taken into account simultaneously .    based on the above points , in this work we improve our mcmc code to include the hadronic branching ratio , and then we re - examine the neutrino signals according to the parameter sets derived in mcmc calculations .",
    "we include the positron fraction data from pamela @xcite , the electron + positron data from fermi - lat and hess @xcite , the diffuse @xmath5-ray data of the gc ridge from hess @xcite , and the antiproton - proton ratio data from pamela @xcite in this mcmc study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the production and propagation of the cr electrons / positrons and antiprotons . in sec .",
    "iii we give the mcmc fitting results of dm model parameters , for both annihilation and decaying scenarios .",
    "the neutrino signals from gc are discussed in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v is the summary .",
    "in the galaxy the transport of charged particles is affected by several processes .",
    "the scattering off random magnetic fields will lead to spatial and energy diffusions .",
    "the stellar wind may also blow away the crs from the galactic plane .",
    "in addition , interactions of cr particles with the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and/or the interstellar medium ( ism ) can result in continuous and catastrophic energy losses .",
    "since the detailed processes affect the propagation are species - dependent , the treatments for positrons and antiprotons are separated . for the transport",
    "processes we take a spatial independent diffusion coefficient @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the rigidity ) and a constant wind @xmath10 directed outwards along @xmath11 .",
    "crs are confined within a cylinder halo @xmath12 , i.e. the differential density is bound by @xmath13 with @xmath14 the scale of the visible galaxy .",
    "the free parameters of the model are the halo size @xmath12 of the galaxy , the normalization of the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 and its slope @xmath16 , and the constant galactic wind @xmath10 .",
    "the propagation equation of crs can be generally written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the destruction rate of crs through interaction with ism in the thin gas disk with half height @xmath19 kpc , @xmath20 is the energy loss rate , and @xmath21 is the source function . the solutions for electrons / positrons and antiprotons are presented in the appendix .",
    "more details about the propagation processes and the solutions of propagation equation can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    for the propagation parameters , we use the medium ( referred as `` med '' ) set of parameters which is derived through fitting the observational b / c data given in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , @xmath22 kpc@xmath23  myr@xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath10=@xmath26 km s@xmath24 and the height of the diffusive halo @xmath27 kpc .",
    "for all the crs we consider here , there are backgrounds originated from the traditional astrophysical sources and/or interactions in the milky way ( mw ) or the earth atmosphere .    the cr proton and helium spectra",
    "are well measured at the earth .",
    "we adopt the parameterizations in ref .",
    "@xcite as the interstellar proton and helium spectra .",
    "then we calculate the positrons ( together with a secondary electron component with almost the same flux ) and antiprotons produced through interactions between cr protons , helium and the ism .",
    "the interaction is restricted in a thin disk with half height @xmath28 kpc and the average ism density is adopted as @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "these parameter choices were shown to be able to give best - fit to the b / c data @xcite . the shapes of secondary positrons and antiprotons",
    "are fixed to the calculated results , and we further employ two normalization parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 to describe the uncertainties about the inelastic hadronic cross section and propagation effect .",
    "@xmath32 is found to be within @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath31 we restrict it in a larger range of @xmath34 since the positrons are more sensitively dependent with the propagation @xcite .",
    "the background of primary electrons is different from that of positrons and antiprotons .",
    "since we do not have exact knowledge of the primary electron injection spectrum from the acceleration source , we adopt a 2-parameter power - law function @xmath35 to describe the injection source of primary electrons .",
    "this is similar to the case of gc @xmath5-rays , which are parameterized by @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are fitted in the mcmc procedure .",
    "there should be two kinds of backgrounds of neutrinos : the atmospheric background and the astrophysical one .",
    "for energies smaller @xmath41 tev the atmospheric background is dominant @xcite .",
    "thus we only consider the comparison with atmospheric background in this work .",
    "the result of atmospheric neutrino background is adopted as the direction - dependent calculation @xcite based on the muon data .",
    "the source function ( emissivity ) of dm annihilation or decay to standard model particles can be written as @xmath42 for dm annihilation , or @xmath43 for dm decay , where @xmath44 is the mass of dm particle , @xmath45 or @xmath46 is the annihilation cross section or decay age of dm respectively , @xmath47 is the branching ratio to final state channel @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the yield spectrum of @xmath50 species for one annihilation or decay for channel @xmath48 , and @xmath51 is dm spatial density in the mw halo . in this work",
    "we consider three channels to lepton pairs @xmath52 as well as a quark channel @xmath53 .",
    "since the antiproton production spectra from decay of various quark flavors do not differ much from each other , we do not distinguish quark flavors but use an average result from all the flavors .",
    "the spectra @xmath54 of positrons , antiprotons , @xmath5-photons and neutrinos from decay of the final state particles of various channels are calculated using pythia package @xcite .",
    "similar as in paper i , we take the density profile of the mw halo as the form @xmath55 where @xmath5 represents the central cusp slope of the density profile , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are scale radius and density respectively . for the mw dm halo",
    ", we adopt the total mass to be @xmath58 m@xmath59 @xcite and the concentration parameter to be @xmath60 @xcite",
    ". then we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 kpc is the virial radius of mw halo .",
    "then @xmath57 can be derived by requiring @xmath63 .",
    "the local density @xmath64 in this process is checked to be within @xmath65 to @xmath66 gev @xmath30 for @xmath5 varying from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "finally there are propagation effects of these particles before being detected by cr detectors . for charged particles such as positrons and antiprotons",
    ", we can replace the source term in eq .",
    "( [ prop ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ annisource])([decaysource ] ) and solve the propagation equations to get the propagated fluxes . for neutral particles like @xmath5-ray photons and neutrinos we just need to integrate the contribution along the line - of - sight of given direction .",
    "more details of the treatment of @xmath5-rays can refer to paper i. note that for neutrinos there will be oscillations between different flavors .",
    "we actually count all flavors of neutrinos from the output of pythia , and multiply a factor @xmath69 to give the result of muon neutrinos .",
    "the full parameter space of this mcmc study is @xmath70 for the branching ratios we have a normalization condition @xmath71 . as a consequence we have @xmath26 free parameters in total .",
    "the probability distribution of the fitting parameters is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : para ] .",
    "the basic fitting results are similar with our previous study in paper i. what s new is the constraint on quark branching ratio from pamela @xmath0 data .",
    "we find that the @xmath2 upper limits of @xmath72 is @xmath73 for dm annihilation and @xmath74 for dm decay respectively .",
    "these results show that the dm to explain the recent cr data indeed needs to dominantly couple with leptons instead of hadrons .    ,",
    "title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "in this section we discuss the neutrino emission of the dm models . for each parameter set in the mcmc samples obtained in the previous calculation , we compute the neutrino flux as a function of energy .",
    "the probability distribution of neutrino flux then can be derived for each energy bin .",
    "the predicted fluxes of @xmath75 from the gc direction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuflux ] . two sky regions , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( half angle of the cone ) around the gc are calculated to show the effects of angular resolution . for comparison",
    "we also show the atmospheric background adopted from ref .",
    "the average results of atmospheric neutrino fluxes are almost the same for @xmath76 and @xmath77 cones",
    ".     uncertainties of muon and anti - muon neutrinos from the gc for annihilation ( _ left _ ) and decaying ( _ right _ ) dm scenarios respectively . the blue solid line shows the atmospheric background . [",
    "fig : nuflux],title=\"fig : \" ]   uncertainties of muon and anti - muon neutrinos from the gc for annihilation ( _ left _ ) and decaying ( _ right _ ) dm scenarios respectively .",
    "the blue solid line shows the atmospheric background .",
    "[ fig : nuflux],title=\"fig : \" ]    it is shown that generally the neutrino fluxes are dominated by the atmospheric background .",
    "for the decaying dm scenario the results are almost always lower than the atmospheric background , even for the angular resolution as good as @xmath76 , which corresponds to the best performance of icecube @xcite . for the annihilation dm case",
    ", the neutrino flux from dm will have a chance to exceed the atmospheric background for energies @xmath78tev , given a very good angular resolution .",
    "otherwise the signal will be still dominated by the background .",
    "however , to better see the detectability of such dm - induced neutrinos , we need to compare the muon events induced by the neutrinos on a detector . following the method given in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculate the expect number of muon events on icecube .",
    "both the contained and through - going events are included .",
    "the size of icecube detector is adopted as @xmath29 km@xmath79 , and the data accumulative time is taken as @xmath80 years .",
    "the expected muon events from both the atmospheric and dm - induced muon neutrinos are compiled in table [ table : muon ] . in the calculation we use the mean values of neutrino fluxes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuflux ] . the integral energy for muons",
    "is adopted from @xmath81 to @xmath82 tev , which ensures us to include dm - induced signal and exclude atmospheric background as effective as possible .",
    "it is shown that for a circle sky region with radius @xmath76 the statistical significance of dm signal is less than @xmath83 for icecube running for @xmath80 years .",
    "the case of dm annihilation is some better than dm decay .",
    "if we enlarge the sky region to about @xmath84 , the number of events will be much larger , both for atmospheric background and dm signal .",
    "the significance of dm signals can reach @xmath85 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that in this case it would be still difficult to pick out signal events from the background events .",
    "the information of spatial distribution and energy spectroscopy is necessary .",
    ".number of muon events between @xmath81 and @xmath82 tev induced by @xmath75 from dm and atmospheric background , for @xmath80-year data taking of icecube .",
    "the number in parentheses is the detection significance defined as @xmath86 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : muon ]    compared with the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite , our predicted neutrino flux for dm annihilation is several times smaller .",
    "this is because in our work the @xmath5-ray constraint is taken into account and a smaller value of the slope of dm central cusp @xmath5 is required .",
    "whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite nfw profile is adopted .",
    "for decaying dm scenario the results do not differ much from each other .",
    "our prediction of neutrino fluxes should be more self - consistent and more reliable .",
    "based on the mcmc code developed in paper i , we further study the properties of dm models which may connect with the recent cr lepton excesses , after incorporating the hadronic branching ratio and the constraint from pamela @xmath0 data .",
    "our global fitting results show that dm with annihilation or decay channels dominantly to the combination of @xmath87 and @xmath88 can well describe the electron and/or positron data measured by pamela , fermi - lat and hess . the @xmath0 data from pamela limit the branching ratio to quark pairs to be less than @xmath89 .",
    "this conclusion is qualitatively consistent with the previous studies @xcite , but should be regarded as the first quantitative result based on the global fitting method .",
    "we then calculate the neutrino fluxes from the dm annihilation or decay according to the mcmc fitting parameters.due to the @xmath5-ray constraint on the dm profile , our expected neutrino flux for dm annihilation scenario is smaller than that in the previous works where the nfw profile is priorly adopted . however , as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and paper i , the nfw profile will be strongly constrained by the diffuse @xmath5-rays from the gc ridge observed by hess @xcite for dm annihilation scenario .",
    "the derived @xmath2 upper limit of the slope of dm central profile is @xmath90 in the mcmc study , which is much smaller than the nfw profile with @xmath91 .",
    "although smaller , the neutrino flux still could be detected by the forth - coming detector such as icecube .",
    "however , a careful analysis about the angular distribution and spectral distribution is necessary to separate the dm - induced signal from the high atmospheric background . for dm decay scenario",
    "the constraint from @xmath5-rays is weaker , and the differences of the neutrino flux between this work and other works are smaller .",
    "the dominant process in the propagation of positrons is energy loss due to synchrotron and inverse compton scattering for energies higher than @xmath78gev . in this paper we will neglect the convection and reacceleration of positrons , which is shown to be of little effect for @xmath92 gev ( also the interested energy range here ) @xcite .",
    "then the propagation equation is @xmath93 in which the second term in the left hand side represents the energy losses .",
    "the energy loss rate of positrons due to synchrotron and inverse compton scattering in the mw can be adopted as @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and @xmath96 s @xcite .",
    "we directly write down the propagator for a point source located at @xmath97 from the solar location with monochromatic injection energy @xmath98",
    "@xcite @xmath99 in which we define a pseudo time @xmath100 as @xmath101 @xmath102 is the green s function for the re - arranged diffusion equation with respect to the pseudo time @xmath100 @xmath103 the effect of boundaries along @xmath104 appears in @xmath105 only .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we use two distinct regimes to approach @xmath105 :    * for @xmath106 ( the extension of electron sphere @xmath107 is small ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 ; * otherwise @xmath110,\\ ] ] where @xmath111;\\",
