    "let @xmath2 be a compact , connected , oriented four - dimensional riemannian manifold and @xmath3 a vector bundle over @xmath2 with structure group @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is a compact lie group compatible with the natural inner product on @xmath3 .",
    "for each connection @xmath5 , the yang - mills functional is defined by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the curvature of @xmath5 .",
    "a connection @xmath5 is a _ yang - mills connection _ if it satisfies the yang - mills equation @xmath8    there have been many significant results on the existence of smooth yang - mills connections on 4-manifolds . in a pioneering work , atiyah , hitchin , drinfeld and manin @xcite constructed self - dual yang - mills connections on @xmath9 .",
    "taubes @xcite established the existence of self - dual ( anti - self - dual ) connections over compact @xmath10-manifolds with positive ( negative ) definite intersection form . in @xcite ,",
    "atiyah and bott established the fundamental result of morse theory for the yang - mills equations on riemann surfaces .",
    "since the yang - mills functional does not satisfy the palais - smale condition in dimension four , taubes @xcite suggested a new framework for morse theory for the yang - mills functional .",
    "however , it seems very challenging to find many applications of the new theory . using @xmath11-equivariant connections , sibner , sibner and uhlenbeck @xcite proved the existence of non - self - dual yang - mills connections on the trivial @xmath12 bundle over @xmath9 .",
    "there are further results ( @xcite , @xcite ) about morse theory for the equivariant yang - mills functional on @xmath10-manifolds .",
    "on the other hand , the theory of yang - mills connections in dimension four has many similarities with the theory of harmonic maps in dimension two . for maps @xmath13 from a two - dimensional manifold @xmath14 to another manifold @xmath15",
    ", the energy functional @xmath16 also fails to satisfy the palais - smale condition . for this reason , sacks and uhlenbeck @xcite introduced an @xmath0-functional @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , to prove the existence of harmonic maps on surfaces .",
    "this new approach via the sacks - uhlenbeck functional @xmath19 is very powerful and has produced tremendous applications in harmonic maps and related topics .",
    "specifically , the sack - uhlenbeck approach is described as follows .",
    "let @xmath20 be a sequence of maps , where @xmath21 is a critical point of the functional @xmath19 and @xmath22 .",
    "sacks and uhlenbeck proved that for a sequence with @xmath23 and having uniformly bounded energies , the sequence @xmath24 converges smoothly to a harmonic map @xmath25 away from at most finitely many points .",
    "moreover , a sophisticated blow - up phenomenon occurs around singularities .",
    "it is natural to ask whether energy is conserved in the blow - up process .",
    "parker @xcite established the energy identity for a sequence of smooth harmonic maps , and ding and tian @xcite proved an energy identity for a sequence of smooth approximate harmonic maps .",
    "it was a long - standing open question to establish the energy identity for the above sequence of critical points @xmath24 of the sacks - uhlenbeck functional @xmath26 .",
    "that is , given that the energies are uniformly bounded as @xmath23 , do there exist harmonic maps @xmath27 with @xmath28 such that @xmath29 for this question , li and wang @xcite established the weak identity for the limit @xmath30 . under an additional assumption ,",
    "lamm @xcite and li and wang @xcite proved that the energy identity ( [ eqn : identity ] ) holds .",
    "however , in a recent preprint @xcite , li and wang constructed a sequence of critical points @xmath31 which provides a counterexample and shows that ( [ eqn : identity ] ) is not true .    following the above sacks - uhlenbeck approach , hong , tian and yin @xcite introduced the yang - mills @xmath0-functional to establish the existence of yang - mills connections . for @xmath32 , the yang - mills @xmath0-functional @xmath33",
    "is defined by @xmath34    in several respects , the yang - mills @xmath0-functional has nicer properties than the yang - mills functional .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the yang - mills @xmath0-flow associated to ( [ functional ] ) admits a global smooth solution , whose limit set contains a smooth critical point of the yang - mills @xmath0-functional . by considering the limit @xmath1 , the authors were then able to obtain existence results for yang - mills connections and the yang - mills flow",
    ". furthermore , sedlacek @xcite applied the weak compactness result of uhlenbeck @xcite to prove that a minimizing sequence @xmath35 of the yang - mills functional converges weakly in @xmath36 to a limiting connection @xmath37 , which can be extended to a yang - mills connection in a ( possibly ) new bundle @xmath38 over @xmath2 .",
    "hong , tian and yin @xcite used the yang - mills @xmath0-flow to find a modified minimizing sequence , which converges to the same limit in the smooth topology up to gauge transformations away from finitely many singular points , which improved the result in @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the modified minimizing sequence , an energy identity was proved .    in this paper",
    ", we continue the program of the yang - mills @xmath0-functional and study the critical points of the yang - mills @xmath0-functional directly .",
    "first , we show    [ theorem1 ] the functional @xmath33 satisfies the palais - smale condition for every @xmath18 .",
    "the palais - smale condition ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) guarantees the existence of a critical point @xmath39 of @xmath40 ; i.e. @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 in the weak sense . in fact , the smoothness of the yang - mills @xmath0-connection @xmath39 is essentially due to isobe in @xcite , and we prove it in the appendix .",
    "we call @xmath41 a yang - mills @xmath0-connection if it satisfies ( [ eulerlagrange1 ] ) .    in analogy with the above sacks - uhlenbeck program , we consider attempting to construct a yang - mills connection as the limit as @xmath1 of a sequence @xmath39 of critical points of @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , it was proved in @xcite that for a sequence @xmath43 , the sequence @xmath44 sub - converges smoothly , up to gauge transformations , to a yang - mills connection @xmath37 away from at most finitely many points .",
    "a natural question to ask is whether energy is lost during the blowup process .",
    "fortunately , we are able to prove the following energy identity :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath39 be a sequence of yang - mills @xmath0-connections on @xmath3 with @xmath23 , and @xmath45 uniformly bounded",
    ". then there exists a finite set @xmath46 and a sequence of gauge transformations @xmath47 defined on @xmath48 , such that for any compact @xmath49 , a subsequence of @xmath50 converges to @xmath51 smoothly in @xmath52 . moreover , there are a finite number of bubble bundles @xmath53 over @xmath9 and yang - mills connections @xmath54 such that @xmath55    this result is surprising in comparison with those of li - wang @xcite , @xcite and lamm @xcite , since we are able to prove the full energy identity for yang - mills @xmath0-connections .",
    "in fact , li - wang @xcite and lamm @xcite used the idea of sacks - uhlenbeck @xcite on removable singularities of harmonic maps in 2 dimensions to obtain that @xmath56 where @xmath57 tends to a singularity @xmath58 .",
    "but they had to handle the term @xmath59 by using a type of pohozaev s identity which involves a very ` bad ' term , so they could not prove the energy identity .",
    "in contrast , the idea of uhlenbeck @xcite on removable singularities of yang - mills connections in 4 dimensions is to construct a broken hodge gauge , which is different from one in @xcite .",
    "we can apply the idea of the broken hodge gauge to show that @xmath60 see lemma 3.7 .",
    "tian @xcite first established the energy identity of a sequence of yang - mills @xmath61-self - dual connections .",
    "rivire @xcite proved the energy identity for a sequence of smooth yang - mills connections in 4 dimensions .",
    "as a consequence of theorem [ maintheorem ] , we can give a different proof of this result ( see corollary [ corol ] ) . as another application",
    ", we are also able to give a new proof of the energy identity results of @xcite ( see proposition [ prop ] ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider whether an energy identity holds at the blowup time for the corresponding heat flows .",
    "struwe @xcite established the global existence of the harmonic map flow in 2 dimensions . ding - tian @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) established the energy identity for the harmonic map flow at the maximal existence time . motivated these results , we can prove a similar result for the yang - mills flow in 4 dimensions .",
    "in fact , struwe @xcite established the global existence of weak solutions of the yang - mills flow @xmath62 with initial value @xmath63 .",
    "struwe proved that the weak solution @xmath64 of the yang - mills flow is , up - to gauge transformations , smooth in @xmath65 for some maximal time @xmath66 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath67 the solution @xmath64 converges , up - to gauge transformations , to a connection @xmath68 , smoothly away from at most finitely many points .",
    "schlatter @xcite gave the details for the blow - up analysis of the yang - mills flow at the singular time @xmath69 , but there is no result concerning the energy identity of the yang - mills flow at the time @xmath69 .",
    "we can apply the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] to establish an energy identity for the yang - mills flow as follows :    [ thm3]let @xmath64 be a solution to the yang - mills flow ( [ ymhf ] ) in @xmath70 , where @xmath71 $ ] is the maximal existence time , and @xmath64 converges weakly as @xmath67 to a connection @xmath68 .",
    "then there are a finite number of bubble bundles @xmath53 over @xmath9 and yang - mills connections @xmath54 such that @xmath72    in particular , if @xmath73 , theorem [ thm3 ] implies a new proof of an identity for a sequence of the second chern numbers of holomorphic vector bundles over khler surfaces ( theorem 11 of @xcite , theorem 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    ", we recall some necessary background and prove theorem 1 . in section 3 , we prove the energy identities theorem 2 and theorem 3 . finally ,",
    "in the appendix , we show the regularity of weak solutions to the euler - lagrange equations .",
    "we begin by recalling background and introducing the notation we will require . denote by @xmath74 the affine space of metric connections on @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath75 be a metric connection .",
    "after fixing a reference connection @xmath76 , we write @xmath77 where @xmath78 . the curvature of @xmath5 is @xmath79 .",
    "here we denote by @xmath80 the adjoint bundle which has fibre @xmath81 , the lie algebra of @xmath4 .",
    "the inner products on a pair of vector bundles induce an inner product on their tensor product . in the case of @xmath82 ,",
    "this is just the negative of the killing form .",
    "this combines with the inner product on @xmath83 to define an inner product on @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , the connections on a pair of vector bundles induce a connection on their tensor product .",
    "thus we obtain a connection on @xmath85 and , using the levi - civita connection , a connection on @xmath84 .",
    "the levi - civita connection also allows us to define multiple iterations of the covariant derivative on any vector bundle .",
    "we denote by @xmath86 both the exterior covariant derivative on @xmath87 , and the exterior covariant derivative on @xmath88 .",
    "the functional @xmath33 has a frchet derivative @xmath89 so the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath33 is ( [ eulerlagrange1 ] ) . note that solutions to ( [ eulerlagrange1 ] ) are smooth up to gauge by the results of the appendix .",
    "then since @xmath90 is bounded below , this equation is equivalent to @xmath91    the functional @xmath33 is invariant under the action of the gauge group @xmath92 , which consists of those automorphisms of @xmath3 which preserve the inner product .",
    "a gauge transformation is thus a section of the bundle @xmath93 , which has fibre @xmath4 .",
    "the gauge group acts on @xmath74 by @xmath94 locally , we write @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 , we find @xmath97 the functional @xmath33 is gauge invariant , so it is more appropriately viewed as a functional @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a space with gauge equivalence and imbued with the quotient topology , but not a smooth manifold .",
    "we first must topologise @xmath74 by a suitable choice of norm .",
    "given a section @xmath100 of a vector bundle @xmath101 with a smooth connection @xmath102 , we define the @xmath103 sobolev norm by @xmath104 different choices of reference connection lead to equivalent norms .",
    "we then define the sobolev space @xmath105 to be the completion of the smooth sections of @xmath101 by the @xmath103 norm .",
    "we may define sobolev norms on the space of connections using the vector bundle @xmath106 .",
    "a different choice of reference connection taken as the origin of the affine space @xmath74 also leads to an equivalent norm .",
    "we denote by @xmath107 the space of connections of class @xmath108 .",
    "since a gauge transformation @xmath109 can be expressed locally over @xmath110 as a map @xmath111 , we will say that a gauge transformation is of class @xmath103 if its local restrictions are of class @xmath103 , and @xmath112 almost everywhere . due to the derivative of the gauge transformation appearing in ( [ gaugetransform ] ) , we need to control two derivatives of the gauge transformation , so we consider @xmath113 .",
    "we will choose @xmath114 , and consider the space @xmath115 and its quotient @xmath116 .",
    "now , we prove that the yang - mills @xmath0-functional satisfies the palais - smale condition on the quotient space .",
    "[ proof of theorem 1 ] we say that a sequence @xmath117 is a palais - smale sequence if it satisfies @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the dual number of @xmath120 ; i.e. @xmath121 . similarly to one in @xcite , the norm @xmath122 here is the dual norm of @xmath123 defined by @xmath124 where @xmath125 we say that the functional ( [ functional ] ) satisfies the palais - smale condition if every palais - smale sequence contains a subsequence that converges in @xmath126 up to gauge transformations .",
    "that is , passing to a subsequence , @xmath127 converges for some sequence of gauge transformations @xmath128 .",
    "note that this condition implies condition c of @xcite .",
    "first we observe that the @xmath129 norm of the curvature can not concentrate , since by hlder s inequality , @xmath130 , the bundle @xmath3 can be trivialized so that we can assume @xmath131 on @xmath132 .",
    "then we apply the gauge - fixing theorem of uhlenbeck ( theorem 1.3 of @xcite ) to obtain that there are local gauge transformations @xmath133 defined on @xmath132 such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 since this result is local , we must do this in each element @xmath136 of a cover of @xmath2 , and check that in the limit the local connections can be sewn together to yield a global connection .",
    "in particular , one must check that the transition functions between elements of the cover are converging .",
    "this procedure is described by sedlacek @xcite .",
    "since @xmath2 is compact , there is a finite open cover @xmath137 of @xmath2 , where @xmath138 for some sufficiently small @xmath139 , and at each @xmath140 , at most a finite number of the balls intersect . from the boundedness of @xmath141",
    ", we have that @xmath142 is bounded in @xmath126 . for simplicity , we define @xmath143 on each ball @xmath136 .",
    "then @xmath144 can be regarded as a local representative of the global connection @xmath145 of @xmath3 over @xmath136 . moreover , in the overlap @xmath146 of two balls , @xmath147 and @xmath148 can be identified as the same by a gauge transformation @xmath149 between @xmath150 and @xmath151 ( see lemma 3.5 of @xcite , also @xcite ) .",
    "thus we can glue @xmath152 together to obtain a global connection @xmath153 , which is @xmath154-gauge equivalent to @xmath145 in the local trivialization of @xmath151 . passing to a subsequence",
    ", it follows from the rellich - kondrachov theorem that @xmath148 converges strongly in @xmath155 , implying that @xmath148 converges in @xmath156 and are uniformly bounded .",
    "since @xmath157 and @xmath158 are bounded , @xmath159 is also bounded . then we also have @xmath160 using hlder s inequality and the fact that @xmath161 , we find @xmath162 denote by @xmath163 terms which are going to zero as @xmath164 .",

    "this completes a proof of theorem 1 .",
