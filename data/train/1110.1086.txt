    "the structural parameters of galaxies are of fundamental importance . uncertainties in estimating a galaxy s physical size , central surface brightness , or total luminosity",
    "can quickly propagate into other key galactic properties .",
    "for example , galaxy mass measurements , based on either the virial theorem or jeans equation modeling , depend linearly on the galactic radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while estimating structural properties should be straightforward , practical considerations such as a limited field size or background estimation can make this a complicated problem .",
    "we have entered a new regime in estimating structural parameters with the discovery of ultra - faint dwarf ( ufd ) galaxies around the milky way and m31 @xcite .",
    "these objects are found via statistical over - densities of resolved stars in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and other large imaging surveys with the faintest ones having total luminosities of merely @xmath2 , or @xmath3l@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of an individual ufd is often debated ( is it a star cluster or dark matter - dominated galaxy ? is it in dynamical equilibrium ? ) and structural parameters are an important tool in this assessment .",
    "however , at the detection limits of the sdss , their low total luminosity translates into a few tens to hundreds of individual stars observed as ufd members . in this regime , a few stars can significantly alter the derived size or total luminosity of a given object .",
    "structural parameters are determined throughout the literature by measuring the surface brightness of a galaxy as a function of radius , and then fitting an analytic function to this profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the surface brightness profile is usually well determined for galaxies based on an integrated light profile , or in the case of nearby luminous ( @xmath5 ) local group galaxies , by summing many thousands of stars in concentric annuli @xcite . in applying these techniques to the ufd galaxies , shot - noise due to the low number of available stars",
    "can produce unreliable results . as an alternative to surface brightness fitting , @xcite determined structural parameters for the milky way ufd galaxies using a maximum likelihood ( ml ) method , building on previous work by @xcite and @xcite . in this method ,",
    "a fixed analytic profile is assumed and its free parameters ( typically galaxy center , half - light radius , ellipticity , position angle and the background level ) are fit simultaneously using all the available stars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this avoids the need to bin or smooth data and should provide more reliable estimates for systems with low number of stars .",
    "there are regimes , however , where even the maximum likelihood method will produce unreliable structural parameters . in this paper",
    ", we explore the transition region between the extreme case where only a few member stars of a resolved galaxy are identified and the well measured galaxies as described above .",
    "a quantitative understanding of this regime will be of increasing importance since large surveys , such as skymapper , pan - starrs , des , and lsst , are predicted to discover many tens to hundreds more low luminosity systems @xcite .",
    "here we perform a representative set of simulations to explore the accuracy of the ml method for structural parameter estimation in cases when the number of stars detected in a galaxy is a few thousand or less . in  [ ssec : sims ] and  [ ssec : ml ] we describe the grid of simulated resolved galaxies , and the ml method used to determine structural parameters in these simulations .",
    "we then consider parameter optimization for the particular cases of the sdss and lsst surveys([sec : surveys ] ) , as well as targeted observations with the canada - france - hawaii - telescope ( cfht ,  [ sec : targeted ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we explore the accuracy of the recovered structural parameters split into the separate effects of density contrast , the total number of stars , and the effects of a limited field - of - view ( fov ) . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize our results to distill them into a set of generalized guidelines for future observations .",
    "how well can structural parameters be measured in the regime where a galaxy is detected as only a low number of resolved stars ? to answer this question , we generate a series of simulated ufd galaxies and assess how different observational variables impact our ability to determine their structural parameters .",
    "we generate a series of simulated resolved galaxies , varying the total number of stars , the relative density of background stars and the physical size of the object relative to the fov .",
    "we then determine the structural parameters of these systems using a maximum likelihood method and compare our recovered values back to the true inputs .",
    "the stellar density profiles of dwarf galaxies , including the ufds , are typically modeled using analytic density laws such as exponential , plummer @xcite or king @xcite profiles .",
    "we construct our model galaxies using a plummer profile , but note that this choice does not affect our conclusions provided the same density law is used to generate both the simulations and recover the structural parameters .",

    "any stellar survey will also include some contaminating sources , either foreground milky way stars or unresolved background galaxies .",
    "we place our satellites over a homogeneous background density @xmath12 with poisson variations . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath13 over the relevant area , and report the central density @xmath10 in units of the background density .",
    "we have assessed the validity of our assumption of a homogeneous background using both the besanon model at the galactic position of coma berenices ( comber ) and botes  ii ( boo  ii ) , and cfht imaging of the same ufd galaxies .",
    "we find that variations for both datasets , in bins of 12 arcmin across a one degree patch in the simulations and the one degree images , are on the order of 10% and are consistent with poisson noise ( see figure  [ fig : besancon ] ) .",
    "we conclude that background variations over an area of one degree , relevant for milky way ufds , are not significant and our choice of a homogeneous background , as a first approximation , is justified .    given the plummer profile above and assuming circular symmetry ,",

    "this is the approach taken by @xcite , although they make a further simplifying assumption that the fov is large enough that integrating the dwarf profile over the field is equivalent to integrating it to infinity .",

    "we define the quantity @xmath51 as the half width of the central 68% of the distribution . while the distributions are not necessarily gaussian , this quantity is equivalent to the one - sigma width for a gaussian distribution .",
    "in addition , it is worth mentioning that in all cases , no appreciable bias in the recovered parameters is observed , that is , the observed distribution of measured values is roughly centered on ( within at most 10% of ) the true input number . in the analysis presented below , we focus primarily on the behavior of the half - light radius and therefore report only @xmath52 values .",
    "in studying ufd galaxies , two different scenarios are relevant : observations made using surveys , and targeted observations with a specific telescope / instrument combination .",
    "these two cases present different observational constraints and we examine each separately .    all of the ufds have so far been discovered in the sdss , but this sample is far from complete due to the survey magnitude limits and sky coverage .",
    "upcoming surveys , such as skymapper , pan - starrs , des and lsst , are expected to find many tens to hundreds more satellites @xcite . for any wide - field imaging survey",
    "two variables pertinent to estimating structural parameters are fixed : the number of observed stars belonging to the dwarf galaxy @xmath53 , and the density contrast .",
    "both depend on the quality and depth of the photometry . for a given satellite s angular size and distance",
    ", the central density depends directly on the number of member stars detected by the survey , and is set primarily by the depth of the photometry , and to a lesser extent , by the quality of the data .",
    "the background density increases with the depth of the survey but better quality data allows for more efficient removal of background unresolved galaxies .",
    "the only free choice an observer faces is the area around the satellite used to carry out the structural parameter determination .",
    "this choice will impact both the relative size of the satellite with respect to the fov and the total number of stars @xmath34 .",
    "navely , one expects the area around the satellite to have a mild effect , if any , on the accuracy of the derived structure , but in the new regime of ultra - faint satellites it is an essential observational consideration .",
    "we focus below on two surveys , sdss and lsst , and examine how selecting different area sizes affects the accuracy of the measured half - light radii .      to illustrate how our simulations can guide the data analysis for study of ufds , we carry out mock observations for two example dwarf galaxies : boo  ii ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and coma berenices ( comber , @xmath57 @xmath58 , @xmath59 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former is one of the smallest and faintest of the ufds , while the latter is rather `` typical '' .",
    "we use for reference the structural parameters of @xcite who used sdss data to carry out a ml study of all ufds discovered before 2008 . for their structural analysis , these authors selected stars within @xmath60 radius of each galaxy down to the sdss magnitude limit of @xmath61 .    from this catalog , boo  ii has a measured half - light radius of @xmath62 and is located at a distance of @xmath63kpc . in terms of the variables studied by our simulations ,",
    "this results in @xmath64 , @xmath40 and @xmath65 .",
    "the simulations show that this combination of parameters for boo  ii yields a @xmath52 of roughly @xmath66 ( similar to the uncertainty reported by @xcite ) and a @xmath67 , indicating that the measurement based on sdss data is highly inaccurate .",
    "it is worth pointing out that @xcite , using deeper photometric observations of boo  ii by roughly one magnitude , reported a @xmath68 , nearly @xmath69 smaller than the @xmath70 found by @xcite , consistent with the uncertainty obtained from our simulations . for the case of comber , the results of @xcite give a half - light radius of @xmath71 and a distance of @xmath72kpc , which results in @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "this combination of parameters gives @xmath76 and , @xmath77 , an improved value as compared to boo  ii . in the case of comber ,",
    "the uncertainties reported by @xcite in their measured half - light radii are somewhat lower that those from our simulations .",
    "to estimate their errors , these authors assumed that the likelihood function is well - described by a gaussian distribution near its maximum , an assumption that probably breaks for the fainter objects .",
    "as mentioned above , potential improvements in the accuracy of the measured sizes can only be achieved by changing the area around the satellite used to select ufd member candidates .",
    "in particular , we explore the effect of choosing a smaller region . given that the density contrast will remain constant , using a smaller fov will bring down the total number of stars . to illustrate the trade - off between increasing @xmath7 while simultaneously decreasing @xmath34 , in figure [ fig : sdss_lsst ] we show the fractional uncertainty as a function of relative size for both boo  ii and comber when the background density and @xmath53 are derived from sdss ( upper lines ) .",
    "in addition , in figure [ fig : sdss_lsst_lum ] we show the fractional uncertainty in luminosity , which roughly correlates with @xmath78 we stress that while the measured uncertainties are shown as function of the satellite s relative size , the total number of stars is also changing . in particular",
    ", @xmath34 varies from higher values on the left to lower values on the right .",
    "this figure shows that better results are obtained for larger fov , with the decrease in uncertainty slowly plateauing as the fov increases .",
    "this improvement is a consequence of the increase in the total number of stars ( see also  5 ) . in practice however , for regions much larger than those used by @xcite the improvements can be further limited , due to potential background fluctuations and gradients across the field .",
    "we therefore conclude that it is not possible to improve substantially the results of @xcite by choosing a smaller fov .",
    "the ultimate limiting factor for a sdss - like survey is the very low density contrast of the satellites with respect to the background , a reflection of both their low surface brightness and the relatively shallow limit of sdss , a limitation that can be applied also to skymapper , expected to reach a similar depth than sdss .    in summary",
    ", for sdss - like surveys , our simulations suggest that large fovs will yield more accurate results , as long as the background density remains homogeneous across the field .",
    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) will image the full sky every two nights to a single exposure depth of @xmath79 over a period of ten years , with a final co - added magnitude limit of @xmath80 @xcite . because lsst is expected to find ufd satellites out to much larger distances as compared to sdss , the same issues will apply in regard to measuring structural parameters in the limit of low numbers of member stars .",
    "an added challenge at lsst magnitude limits will be unresolved background galaxies which will increasingly contribute to the background source counts fainter than @xmath81 ( e.g. , see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "to assess the expected performance of lsst we carry out mock observations of the ufd galaxy comber , placed at two different distances : its true distance of 44kpc and farther away at 400kpc .",
    "we estimate the number of ufd stars , @xmath53 , detectable down to the full co - added lsst survey magnitude limit using a theoretical luminosity function typical of the ufds so far discovered : a 13gyr old population with overall metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath82 @xcite , assuming a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "for comber at 44kpc , we obtain @xmath83 .",
    "we combine this information with the known angular size of this system to determine its central density . to derive a density contrast we then need to estimate the background density . for a survey like lsst",
    ", this variable is ultimately tied to our ability to characterize the contamination , due either to foreground milky way stars or unresolved background galaxies .",
    "we estimate the expected contamination from milky way stars at these magnitudes by generating fake photometric data for our galaxy using the trilegal tool @xcite .",
    "for the relevant magnitude range ( @xmath84 ) this yields foreground star densities that are negligible compared to those of background galaxies within our color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) window ( as we illustrate in figure  [ fig : gal_star](b ) ) .",
    "our primary contamination will then come from unresolved background galaxies . to estimate their contribution to @xmath12",
    ", we use the hubble - ultra - deep - field ( hudf ) catalog under the assumption that the distribution of galaxies is isotropic . using a region of the cmd",
    "similar to the one used to select ufd stars , we estimate a background density of @xmath85galarcmin@xmath86 down to the limit of @xmath87 .",
    "this yields @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the fraction of background galaxies that can be potentially removed photometrically .",
    "if we assume , for instance , that we can remove 80% of this contamination and sharp , we can remove up to 80% of background galaxies down to a magnitude limit of @xmath90 . in practice , this fraction is likely to be lower for @xmath87 . ]",
    "we obtain @xmath91 .",
    "this number may seem surprisingly low compared to the density contrast achieved by @xcite using shallower data .",
    "however , this is only a reflection of the fact that unresolved galaxy counts grow significantly faster at faint magnitudes .",
    "this is true even if we allow the density of background galaxies to vary by a factor a few with respect to the hudf .",
    "a benefit of deeper photometry is the increase in the total number of detections @xmath34 .",
    "for comber at 44kpc , and assuming we can remove 80% of the galaxy counts , we get @xmath92 for a half - light radius to fov ratio of @xmath93 , yielding @xmath94 . the lower line in figure  [ fig : sdss_lsst ] shows the dependence of the relative uncertainty with the satellite s relative size for this particular choice of density contrast value .",
    "both the density contrast and the total number of stars are large enough that the measured uncertainty is rather insensitive to the choice of fov .",
    "one of the unique aspects of lsst related to ufds is the expectation of finding galaxies as faint as @xmath95 out to the virial radius of our galaxy , located roughly at 400kpc @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : gal_star](a ) we show the required fraction of background galaxies that must be removed as a function of @xmath96-band depth to achieve a given density contrast in the context of observing a comber - like satellite ( @xmath97 , @xmath98pc ) located at 400kpc .",
    "the figure shows curves for three different values of @xmath10 , 15 , 20 and 50 . to achieve a density contrast of at least 20 for magnitudes fainter than @xmath99 , more than 90% of the unresolved galaxies",
    "must be subtracted .",
    "we note that while the fraction of galaxies that need to be removed does not increase at deeper magnitudes , the actual background density is a strong function of depth ( figure  [ fig : gal_star](b ) ) .",
    "alternatively , one can ask what is the limiting distance at which we can characterize the half - light radii of a given ufd with an intrinsic uncertainty of 10% or better ( or equivalently , reach a density contrast of 20 or higher ) .",
    "the answer to this question is ultimately a function of our ability to separate efficiently stellar from non - stellar detections . for illustration purposes",
    ", we will assume an upper limit of 90% of galaxy removal . with this number",
    "we find that for a comber - like satellite , we obtain a density contrast of 20 or more out to about 400kpc , but not farther .",
    "in contrast , for fainter ufds , i.e. with @xmath100 , comparable to systems like segue  i , boo  ii or willman  i , the limit distance is @xmath101kpc .",
    "the same is true for brighter ( @xmath102 ) but larger ufds ( i.e. systems with half - light radii larger than 100pc ) . achieving density contrasts that allow proper determination of structural parameters for distant ufds will thus present a major observational challenge",
    "follow - up targeted imaging of ufds can provide more accurate structural parameters than the discovery survey data @xcite .",
    "we next explore how to optimize targeted observations to provide the most accurate structural parameter estimates .",
    "in contrast to survey data , the practical observing constraint is the total exposure time which translates into a trade - off between photometric depth versus area covered .",
    "we choose to analyze a comber - like satellite , although the conclusions are applicable to the majority of the ufds , for two scenarios requiring the same exposure time : a single @xmath103 pointing down to @xmath31 and four pointings down to @xmath104 .",
    "this choice of area was motivated by @xcite who used the telescope / instrument combination of cfht / megacam .",
    "the fov of the instrument is now fixed , and thus @xmath7 is determined by the size of the satellite . for observations of comber",
    "down to @xmath90 , the extrapolated number of stars belonging to the dwarf galaxy corresponds to @xmath105 . assuming a background density similar to that estimated by @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath106 , @xmath107 and a density contrast of @xmath108 .",
    "thus , for a single deep pointing covering @xmath109 we obtain @xmath110 . in comparison , observations down to @xmath111 covering twice the size of the fov ( four times the surveyed area ) , result in @xmath112 , @xmath74 and @xmath113 .",
    "this example shows that , in general , given the choice of depth versus area , the former yields better uncertainties . in light of this result , it is relevant to assess whether there is an optimal depth for which uncertainties will be under 10% .",
    "figure [ fig : twopanels ] shows that , for a given total number of stars and satellite s relative size , the overall uncertainties only marginally improve for density contrasts beyond 20 .",
    "thus , in planning targeted observations of ufd galaxies , exposure times should be calculated so that @xmath114 .",
    "deeper photometry , presumably resulting in greater density contrast , will not have an appreciable effect on the overall quality of the measured parameters .",
    "of course , this does not preclude the observer from seeking higher density contrasts for different purposes .",
    "in addition , one should plan the area coverage so that , ideally , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "total number of stars as low as @xmath117 will yield @xmath118 within the same range of satellite s relative size and density contrast value ( panel ( a ) of figure [ fig : twopanels ] ) .",
    "the main goal of our simulations is to provide observers with a set of tools to help select the appropriate set of parameters when designing observations of ufds .",
    "as shown in previous sections , the distribution of recovered @xmath7 values will depend on all three parameters simultaneously : total number of stars , satellite s relative size and density contrast .",
    "however , it is possible to distill these results into a set of  rules of thumb \" by isolating the effects of each variable independently .    in figure [",
    "fig : effect_all](a ) we explore the effects of varying the satellite s relative size . in this figure , we show the distribution of @xmath7 for three cases where we have varied the size of the satellite . for this particular example",
    "we fix @xmath119 while simultaneously keeping the density contrast fixed at @xmath120 .",
    "the general trend illustrated by panel ( a ) is such that , for a constant number of stars , in the limit where the size of the satellite is comparable to the fov ( @xmath121 ) or when the field is too large ( @xmath122 ) , our ability to recover the intrinsic value of the half - light radii decreases significantly .",
    "this is readily understood since for large satellite sizes , with respect to the fov , we are not able to probe the full profile , while for small sizes , the number of ufd stars decreases ( for a fixed @xmath34 ) and the satellite s signal is diluted . in practice",
    "however , as one uses a larger fov , the number of stars also increases , and therefore the measured uncertainty behaves as shown in figure [ fig : sdss_lsst ] , that is , no improvement or worsening in accuracy is achieved beyond @xmath123 .",
    "observing larger fovs should not be a problem , since one can always use only a subset of the data .",
    "we next investigate the effect of varying the total number of stars , @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ fig : effect_all](b ) shows the distribution of recovered @xmath7 for three simulations with input values @xmath117 , 1000 and 5000 , bracketing values obtained for various current and future surveys ( see table [ tab : surveys ] ) , and constant @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the figure shows that when all other variables are constant , increasing the total number of stars improves the parameter estimation . for the entire grid of simulations",
    "we find that for a wide range of @xmath10 and @xmath7 values , uncertainties better than 10% require a minimum of @xmath126 .",
    "finally , we investigate the effects of varying the density contrast @xmath10 , on the recovered half - light radii . in figure",
    "[ fig : effect_all](c ) , we show the distribution of measured half - light radii for three different choices of central density ( in units of the background density ) , 5 , 10 , and 50 for satellites with @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "figure  [ fig : effect_all ] shows that , as intuitively expected , as the stellar density contrast between the satellite and the background increases , the distribution of measured half - light radii becomes narrower and better defined ( i.e. , more gaussian ) yielding a median value closer to the intrinsic value .",
    "we find that for a given combination of @xmath34 and @xmath7 , the improvement in the measured uncertainties is most significant for @xmath127 .",
    "for higher values of the density contrast , @xmath52 decreases only marginally .",
    "with the discovery of the ufds we have entered a new luminosity regime dominated by shot noise and where traditional methods to estimate structural parameters no longer yield reliable results . in this article , we have carried out mock observations of a suite of simulated ufd galaxies aimed at exploring how different observational choices impact our ability to extract reliable structural information for these systems . in particular , we have investigated the effects of the total number of stars in a given survey , central - to - background density contrast and relative size of the satellite with respect to the fov .",
    "our mock observations allow us to propose a set of simple  rules of thumb \" designed to help plan studies of ufds with existing and/or upcoming surveys as well as plan follow - up observations : ( a ) the ratio of the radius of the satellite relative to the fov must be smaller than @xmath128 , ( b ) the exposure time should be calculated so that density contrast is @xmath27 .",
    "higher numbers will result in marginal gains in parameter uncertainties and ( c ) for observations of ufds with photometric surveys the density contrast will be fixed by the survey parameters , and therefore the primary observational choice is the area around the satellite .",
    "this should be chosen so that , ideally , @xmath116 .    it is worth keeping in mind that these rules of thumb are derived for the best case scenario , i.e. , the choice of density profile faithfully describes the real data , the satellite is perfectly circular , and the background density is homogeneous throughout the fov . in practice , all three assumptions are likely to be broken in varying degrees , which will lead to further uncertainties not quantified by this study .",
    "this leaves room for many possible extensions to the present study .",
    "future work should include , for instance , an exploration of the effects of recovering structural parameters using a density law different from that used to construct the simulations .",
    "including intrinsic elongation for the simulated satellites is also warranted given the high ellipticity found for most ufds , as it is extending the analysis to satellites that present small tidal disturbances .",
    "we have shown that the new regime of extreme luminosities probed by the ufd population often results in unreliable structural parameters , especially when relatively shallow photometric surveys , such as sdss , are used . in the particular case of the half - light radii , on which mass estimates depend linearly ,",
    "numbers based on sdss catalogs can have intrinsic uncertainties as high as 100% for the faintest and more diffuse ufds .",
    "these higher uncertainties will , for instance , propagate directly into the predicted @xmath129-ray fluxes coming from ufds due to dark matter annihilation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . assessing the reliability of the measured structural parameters",
