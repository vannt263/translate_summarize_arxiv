    "the twin ` paradox ' has experienced countless re - imaginings and interpretations throughout the course of relativistic physics , and has a long and controversial history @xcite . in its most basic form , it is often the first description of non - absolute time that a student will encounter .",
    "it acts as a fantastic opportunity to test their understanding of special relativity , with each variation upon the paradox providing a new viewpoint on the ` relative ' nature of time .    in its original form ,",
    "the paradox may be stated as follows : there are two identical twins  one of which climbs aboard a rocket and travels away at relativistic speeds , while the other remains on earth . after a while",
    ", the travelling twin turns around and returns home .",
    "each twin has seen the other as moving away and returning , and so a naive application of special relativistic time dilation will predict that each twin would expect themself to be older upon reuniting .",
    "the resolution to this may be seen by recognising that the experience of each twin is not entirely identical  the travelling twin has to turn around and return to earth , while the other remains in an inertial frame throughout .",
    "although further extensions to the paradox have been made in an attempt to remove acceleration , the same conclusion is always found : in flat spacetime , the stationary twin is always eldest upon reunion , whilst the travelling twin will always be younger . in other words ,",
    "the twin who follows a geodesic path ( i.e. remains in an inertial frame ) will experience a greater proper time between two events in flat spacetime .",
    "an infrequently examined form of the paradox may be seen upon extension to the framework of general relativity  by ensuring that the path of each twin passes through curved spacetime .",
    "this extension is able to provide apparently contradictory results to the original , as multiple geodesic paths between events may exist .",
    "for example , one may imagine that in the vicinity of a point mass , a twin wishing to return to their original position may do so by either following an orbital path around the mass , or a purely radial one ( travelling outward and freefalling back down ) .",
    "conversely , a twin who is stationary with respect to the mass is no longer in an inertial frame , and must necessarily feel a force due to acceleration . identifying the eldest twin in this case is no longer trivial  this question may no longer be answered by simply determining which twin undergoes acceleration . while it is known that the longest path between two points must be a geodesic , it is not immediately obvious which geodesic this must be . due to the increased complexity of the general relativistic paradox ,",
    "prior approaches have only investigated the simplest cases in a given spacetime individually , and have done so analytically @xcite .    in what follows ,",
    "we describe a novel computational method to trace multiple paths between two spacetime events , allowing for the general relativistic twin paradox to be made easily accessible . as an example of the strength and simplicity of this method ,",
    "we investigate accelerated and geodesic paths in both the morris - thorne and schwarzschild metrics .",
    "this method was devised by undergraduate students at the university of sydney , and may be applied to any chosen metric .",
    "the difficulty of its application is set by the complexity of the metric .",
    "as such , this method could be utilised equally in the teaching of courses on general relativity .",
    "in general relativity , a twin in free - fall will follow a path described by a geodesic . in the case that a twin should activate their rocket at any point on their path , their deviation from the geodesic may be described by a 4-acceleration , defined in einstein summation convention as    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the covariant derivative , @xmath2 is the time indicated by a standard clock carried by the twin moving along the path @xmath3 with 4-velocity @xmath4 , and the christoffel symbols @xmath5 are unique to the spacetime through which the twin is passing .",
    "we also require that the twins follow a ` timelike ' path , providing the requirement    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the metric tensor of the specific spacetime , and the signature convention @xmath8 has been adopted .",
    "we have also used geometrised units , where @xmath9 .",
    "+ it follows from ( [ geo ] ) that the 4-acceleration of a twin is perpendicular to their 4-velocity : @xmath10    in order to examine the twin paradox , we require that each path begin and end at the same pair of spacetime coordinates . as such , this problem must be solved as a boundary value problem ( bvp ) , with bounds on @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the equations of motion must be solved in terms of @xmath11 , such that the proper time may simply be output upon reuniting the paths .",
    "rearranging ( [ geo ] ) and defining @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , we find the following equations of motion    @xmath16    @xmath17    similarly , the normalisation conditions ( [ u.u ] ) and ( [ a.u ] ) now become @xmath18 @xmath19    in this framework , @xmath20 may be chosen arbitrarily , and the corresponding @xmath21 derived from rearranging ( [ a.u ] ) , giving : @xmath22    to investigate geodesic paths , we simply set @xmath23 in ( [ at ] ) , giving @xmath24 .",
    "equations ( [ accelgeo1 ] ) and ( [ accelgeo2 ] ) , which are a set of four 2nd order ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , may now be split into eight 1st order odes and solved as a boundary value problem .",
    "matlab s ` bvp4c ` solver is used to solve the ode s , and requires a total of 8 boundary conditions . to reunite the twins ,",
    "boundaries must be placed on the initial and final coordinates @xmath25 , where the initial value of @xmath26 is set by application of ( [ u.u2 ] ) as @xmath27    we now may straightforwardly input the metric tensor and christoffel symbols of a particular spacetime , specify the initial and final coordinates , and the ` bvp4c ` solver will determine the initial derivatives of each variable . if the region between two given spacetime points is numerically tractable , the proper time experienced by each twin will simply be output at the end of their paths .",
    "a sample of the code has been included which allows the reader to reproduce the following results , and is included in [ appa ] so as to not detract the reader s attention from the flow of the paper .",
    "comments have also been included within the code to aid the reader .",
    "we now apply this method to two simple metrics  the morris - thorne wormhole , and the schwarzschild black hole . by investigating both accelerated and geodesic paths",
    ", we were able to identify the path between two spacetime events that a twin follows to maximise the proper time they experience .",
    "in each of the following scenarios , the twins were reunited after a coordinate time @xmath28 , defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial radial coordinate distance from the origin , and @xmath31 is the coordinate time taken to complete a geodesic circular orbit at a radius of @xmath30 around a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath32 . here , @xmath33 is some chosen factor that will be varied to set the coordinate time at which the twins reunite .    for accelerated paths , only the radial component of the four - acceleration",
    "is varied , so that @xmath34 .",
    "the radial component @xmath35 of each twin is varied linearly as a function of the coordinate time @xmath11 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the maximum magnitude of @xmath35 , as demonstrated in figure [ arplot ] below .",
    "the morris - thorne ( mt ) metric describes a spherically symmetric , non - vacuum , traversable ` wormhole ' solution to the einstein field equations @xcite",
    ". this wormhole acts as a link between two seperate regions of spacetime , and requires a distribution of exotic matter with negative energy density .",
    "the line element of this metric ( equation b2a in @xcite , equation 2.16.1 in @xcite ) is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wormhole throat parameter , describing the width of the throat , and @xmath40 is the radial proper distance , ranging from @xmath41 to @xmath42 on each ` side ' of the wormhole respectively . here",
    ", we have used a wormhole throat parameter @xmath43 ; varying this parameter will not change the results found .    upon inputting the christoffel symbols of the mt spacetime @xcite to the method previously outlined , it was found that for any pair of spacetime points on the same ` side ' of the wormhole , two geodesic paths exist between them  as shown in figure  [ mtorbit ] .",
    "the first of these passes close to the wormhole throat without passing through , bending around to reach the geodesic endpoint .",
    "the other follows a more direct route , covering a smaller azimuthal angular distance @xmath44 , and is bent only marginally by the wormhole .",
    "direct comparison of the proper time along these paths , as shown in figure  [ mtgeo ] , provides an initial resolution : the twin that covers the smallest azimuthal distance without accelerating will be eldest within the mt spacetime .",
    "examination of accelerated paths gives greater insight into the nature of each set of geodesics , as shown in figure  [ mtorbitaccel ] .",
    "the radial component of four - acceleration of each path is varies according to ( [ areqn ] ) . by exploring a range of values for the maximum radial component of the four acceleration , @xmath37",
    ", we can compare the proper time experienced along each of these accelerated paths to that experienced along geodesics ",
    "the ratio of these proper times is plotted in figure  [ mtaccel ] .",
    "interestingly , we find accelerated paths that have proper times greater than the geodesic that covers the larger azimuthal distance .",
    "in contrast to the special relativistic paradox , we find that acceleration will not always cause a twin to be younger .",
    "rather , there appears to be a hierarchy of the experienced proper times , in decreasing order as : azimuthally minimal geodesics , ` weakly ' accelerated paths , azimuthally maximal geodesics , and ` strongly ' accelerated paths .",
    "the spacetime geometry in the vicinity a non - rotating and uncharged black hole of mass @xmath32 may be described by the line element of the schwarzschild metric in eddington - finkelstein coordinates ( equations 2.2.35 , 2.2.36 in @xcite ) :    @xmath45    where @xmath46    in this coordinate system , twins may reunite within the event horizon without encountering a coordinate singularity at the schwarzschild radius , @xmath47 . here , we have used a black hole mass of @xmath48 ; varying this parameter will not change the results found . as with the method followed for the mt wormhole , the christoffel symbols for this metric were input , and a range of paths compared .",
    "similar to the previous case , two types of geodesics were encountered : those which cover the minimal azimuthal distance , and those covering a non - minimal azimuthal distance  a number of each of these are shown in figure  [ schwarzorbits ] .",
    "by comparing the proper times of the two types of geodesic paths through spacetime , shown in figure  [ schwarzgeo ] , we find again that the azimuthally minimal geodesic is longer for all paths investigated . likewise",
    ", comparison of these two types of geodesics to a range of accelerated paths , as in figure  [ bhaccelorbit ] and [ schwarzaccel ] , provides the same ranking of experienced proper times as for the mt wormhole , in decreasing order as : azimuthally minimal geodesics , ` weakly ' accelerated paths , azimuthally maximal geodesics , and ` strongly ' accelerated paths .",
    "examining the twin paradox in special relativity equips students with the idea that time is relative . however",
    ", it does not provide a complete description of the behaviour of time in the universe .",
    "analytically extending the problem to general relativity is often inaccessible to students due to its mathematical complexity .",
    "a computational approach provides simplicity , and is a nice tool to show students how objects behave in the metric under examination .",
    "the difficulty of the project may be tuned by simply choosing a metric of different complexity , allowing for the teaching of general relativity at an advanced level .    here , we have described a computational method to numerically compute the age of a twin that passes between two given spacetime events . by application of this method to two simple metrics",
    ", we have shown that not only is the issue of proper time significantly more complex in general relativity , but also that seemingly contrary results may be found . in opposition to the original paradox , accelerating twins may actually be the _",
    "eldest _  dependent upon the path taken by the other .",
    "however , while the absolutely longest path remains a geodesic , identifying that path from the possible geodesic paths remains complex ; we leave this for a future contribution @xcite .",
    "this method may be applied to any required metric , and is simple in its application .",
    "consequently , it provides a unique means for students to investigate the behaviour of time under the effects of curvature , as well as to study individual metrics .",
    "for example , using this computational approach , we were able to reveal an apparent correlation between the traversed azimuthal angular distance of a geodesic and the experienced proper time ( a result which we originally termed as the _ azimuthal hypothesis _ ) .",
    "although such a statement would need to be proven analytically , the quick formulation of the hypothesis demonstrates the utility of using this computational approach to explore and investigate the nature of time in general relativity .",
    "it may yet be seen that the azimuthally minimal path may be the globally longest geodesic in any spherically symmetric , static , stationary spacetime , but any such claim would require an exploration of further metrics than those undertaken here .",

    "hac would additionally like to thank george f. r. ellis for helpful correspondence .",
