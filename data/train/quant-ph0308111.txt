    "generally , the design of the optimal multimeter should involve the optimization of both the dependence of the program on the measurement basis and the fixed joint measurement on the program and data states . however , this is a very hard problem that we will not attempt to solve in its generality .",
    "instead , we will design an optimal multimeter for a particular simple and natural choice of the program .",
    "namely , similarly as in @xcite , we assume that the program of the multimeter @xmath4 which determines the measurement basis consists of @xmath5 copies of the basis state @xmath6 , @xmath7 . since we have restricted ourselves to the bases ( [ pcbasis ] ) , the state @xmath8 can be obtained form @xmath6 via unitary transformation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the pauli matrix .",
    "this implies that all the programs of the form @xmath11 because these programs are related via a _ fixed",

    "[ fig0 ] . this _ fixed _ joint measurement on the data and program can be also interpreted as an effective measurement on the data register , which is described by the povm @xmath14 and depends of the program via @xmath15 , \\label{pcdatapovm}\\ ] ] where the subscripts @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the data and program states , respectively .",

    "consequently the multimeter indeed probabilistically implements the projective measurement in the basis @xmath326 and the effective povm on the data qudit reads @xmath327",
    "in this paper we have investigated a broad class of quantum multimeters that can perform a projective measurement on a single data qubit ( or qudit ) .",
    "the main feature of the quantum multimeters is that the measurement basis is controlled by the quantum state of the program register that serves as a kind of a quantum `` software '' while the multimeter itself ( a quantum `` hardware '' ) performs a fixed joint measurement on the data and program states .    in our investigations",
    "we have assumed finite - dimensional program register , typically consisting of several qubits ( or qudits ) . in this case",
    "it is impossible to design perfect multimeter that would perform exactly and deterministically the projective measurement in any basis from a continuous set , with the basis being determined by the state of the program register .",
    "the multimeters designed here are therefore only approximate .",
    "two conceptually different approximations have been considered . in the first case",
    ", the multimeter operates deterministically and always produces an outcome but the effective measurement on the data deviates from the ideal projective measurement .",
    "such errors are avoided in the second approach when the multimeter is a probabilistic device whose operation sometimes fails but , when it succeeds , then it carries out exactly the desired projective measurement .    we have demonstrated that these two kinds of multimeters are in fact just limit cases from a whole class of probabilistic multimeters that are characterized by a certain fraction @xmath68 of the inconclusive results . for a fixed dependence of the program on the measurement basis , the problem of designing the optimal multimeter is formally equivalent to finding the optimal povm for discrimination of two mixed states . with the help of the recently developed theory of optimal probabilistic discrimination of mixed quantum states",
    "we have been able to analytically determine the optimal phase - covariant multimeter for @xmath5-qubit program @xmath328 as well as a universal multimeter with a two - qubit program @xmath329 .",
    "remarkably , in both cases the success rate of the optimal deterministic multimeter exactly coincides with the optimal fidelity of estimation of the basis state @xmath6 from a single copy of the program state .",
    "we have also proposed a generalization of the probabilistic error - free multimeter to qudits assuming that the @xmath257-qudit program consists of a product of the @xmath257 basis states .",
    "the construction of this multimeter is inspired by the structure of the optimal probabilistic multimeter for qubits and relies on projections on totally anti - symmetric state of @xmath257 qudits .",
    "our findings clearly illustrate that the measurement on the data qubit can be quite efficiently controlled by the quantum state of the program register .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that a classical description of the measurement basis would require infinitely many bits of classical information , while only a few quantum bits suffice in the present case to obtain an _ error - free _",
    "( although probabilistic ) operation .",
    "our results also reveal many intriguing connections between the concept of quantum multimeters , discrimination of quantum states and optimal quantum state estimation .",
    "this suggests that there might be also links to the related problems of transmitting information about the direction in space @xcite or about the reference frame @xcite using the quantum states .",
    "for instance , it is well known that the use of entangled states can improve the fidelity of transmission in the two latter cases .",
    "a natural question arises whether using entangled states as programs one could achieve higher success rate ( for a fixed size of the program register ) than with the product - state programs considered in the present paper . more generally , one would ultimately like to know what is the _ optimal program _ leading to maximal achievable success rate .",
