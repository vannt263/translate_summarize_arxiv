    "the gapless energy spectrum of electrons and holes in graphene layers ( gls ) , graphene bilayers ( gbls ) , and non - bernal stacked multiple graphene layers ( mgls )  @xcite , opens up prospects of creating terahertz ( thz ) lasers based on these graphene structures . in such structures , gls and mgls with optical  @xcite and injection  @xcite",
    "pumping can exhibit the interband population inversion and negative dynamic conductivity in the thz range of frequencies and , hence , can serve as active media in thz lasers . the most direct way to create",
    "the interband population in gls and mgls is to use optical pumping  @xcite with the photon energy @xmath0 corresponding to middle- and near- infrared ( ir ) ranges . in this case , the electrons and holes , photogenerated with the kinetic energy @xmath1 , transfer their energy to optical phonons and concentrate in the states near the dirac point  @xcite .",
    "the amplification of thz radiation from optically - pumped gl structures observed recently  @xcite is attributed to the interband stimulated emission .",
    "however , the optical pumping with relatively high photon energies exhibits drawbacks .",
    "first of all , the optical pumping , which requires complex setups , might be inconvenient method in different applications of the prospective graphene thz lasers .",
    "second , the excessive energy being received by the photogenerated electro - hole plasma from pumping source can lead to its marked heating because of the redistribution of the initial electron and hole energy @xmath1 among all carries due to rather effective inter - carrier collisions .",
    "the latter results in a decrease of the ratio of the quasi - fermi energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the electron - hole effective temperature @xmath4 that , in turn , complicates achieving of sufficiently large values of the dynamic conductivity . as demonstrated recently  @xcite , the negative conductivity at the thz frequencies is very sensitive to the ratio of the photon energy @xmath5 and the optical phonon energy @xmath6 , as well as to the relative efficiency of the inter - carrier scattering and the carrier scattering on optical phonons .",
    "the decay of nonequilibrium optical phonons also plays an important role .",
    "the abovementioned complications can be eliminated in the case of pumping resulting in the generation in gls electrons and holes with relatively low initial energies .",
    "this in part can be realized in the case of optical pumping with @xmath7@xcite .",
    "taking into account that in gls @xmath8  ev , in the case of co@xmath9 laser as a pumping source , @xmath10 .",
    "as shown  @xcite , in such a case , the electron - hole plasma can even be cooled , so that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the lattice ( thermostat ) temperature .",
    "another weakly heating or even cooling pumping method which can provide low effective temperature @xmath4 ( including @xmath11 ) is the injection pumping of electrons from n - section and holes from p - section in gl and mgl structures with p - i - n junctions .    in this paper",
    ", we study the injection phenomena in gl and mgl p - i - n structures and calculate their characteristics important for thz lasers .",
    "the idea to use p - n junctions in gls was put forward and briefly discussed by us previously  @xcite .",
    "here we consider more optimal designs of the structures ( with a sufficiently long i - section ) and account for realistic mechanisms of recombination at elevated temperatures ( at the room temperature and slightly below ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the device structures under consideration and principles of their operation .",
    "the pertinent equations of the model governing the balance of electrons , holes , and optical phonons ( rate equations ) are presented in sec .",
    "these equations are reduced to an equation governing the electron - hole effective temperature .",
    "the solution of this equation in secs .",
    "iv and v ( both analytically in limiting cases and numerically ) allows us to find the effective temperature of optical phonons and the current as functions of the applied voltage , the structural parameters , and the lattice temperature .",
    "vi , the obtained characteristics of the injected electron - hole plasma are used to calculate the dependence of the dynamic conductivity of the latter as a function of the signal thz frequency and other quantities .",
    "vii deals with the model limitations and discussion . in sec .",
    "viii , we draw the main conclusions .",
    "we consider devices which comprise a gl or an mgl structure with several non - bernal stacked gls .",
    "it is assumed that the sections of gls adjacent to the side contacts are doped ( p- and n - sections ) .",
    "the device structure under consideration is shown in fig .",
    "the dc voltage @xmath13 is applied between the side contacts to provide the forward bias of the p - i - n junction . due to doping of the side sections with the acceptor and donor sheet concentration @xmath14 , the electron and hole fermi energies counted from the dirac point are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the reduced planck constant , and @xmath19",
    "cm / s is the characteristic velocity of the carrier spectrum in gls . instead of doping of the side sections , the p- and n - sections",
    "can be created using highly conducting gates over these sections to which the gate voltages @xmath20 and @xmath21 are applied  @xcite . in this case , the chemically doped p- and n - sections are replaced by the electrically induced sections ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) as shown in fig .",
    "in single - gl structures , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spacing between the gl and the gate . in the case of mgl structures ,",
    "the situation becomes more complex due to the screening of the transverse electric field in gls  @xcite although the effective electric doping can be achieved in mgl structures with about dozen gls .",
    "for definiteness , in the following we shall consider primarily the devices with chemically doped p - i - n junctions .",
    "as shown below , under certain conditions the frequency - dependent dynamic conductivity of the gl or mgl structures can be negative in a certain range of the signal frequencies . in this case",
    ", the self - excitation of thz modes propagating in the substrate serving as a dielectric waveguide ( in the direction perpendicular to the injection current ) and lasing is possible .",
    "the metal gates in the devices with electrically induced p - i and i - n junctions can also serve as the slot - line waveguides for thz waves . apart from this , the self - excitation of surface plasmons ( plasmon - polaritons ) is possible as well ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite )    when the p - i - n junction under consideration is forward biased by the applied voltage @xmath13 , the electrons and holes are injected to the i - section from the pertinent doped side sections .",
    "the injected electrons and holes reaching the opposite doped section can recombine at it due to the interband tunneling or escape the i - section due to the thermionic processes .",
    "the band profiles in the structures under consideration at @xmath24 and at the forward bias @xmath25 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "since the probability of such tunneling is a very sharp function of angle of incidence , the leakage flux due to the tunneling electrons ( holes ) is much smaller that the flux of injected electrons ( holes ) .",
    "the currents associated with the tunneling and thermionic leakage of electrons at the p - i - junction and holes at the i - n - junction depend on the electric field at the pertinent barriers and the applied voltage @xmath13 . because the relative role of the leakage currents diminishes with increasing length of the i - section @xmath26 , width of the p - i- and i - n- junctions @xmath27 , and the barrier height at these junctions @xmath28 , we shell neglect it . the pertinent conditions will be discussed in the following .",
    "thus it is assumed that the main fractions of the injected electrons and holes recombine inside the i - section .",
    "the recombination of electrons and holes in gls at not too low temperatures is mainly determined by the emission of optical photons  @xcite .",
    "considering the sub - threshold characteristics ( i.e. , the states below the threshold of lasing ) and focusing on the relatively high - temperature operation , we shall account for this recombination mechanism and disregard others  @xcite including the mechanism  @xcite associated with the tunneling between the electron - hole puddles ( if any )  @xcite .",
    "due to high net electron and hole densities in mgl structures with sufficient number of gls , the latter mechanism can be effectively suppressed  @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the net recombination rate in the whole i - section is much smaller than the fluxes of injected electrons and holes .",
    "due to rather effective inter - carrier scattering , the electron and hole distribution functions ( at least at not too high energies ) can be very close to the fermi distribution functions with quasi - fermi energies @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the electron - hole effective temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the latter quantities are generally different from those in equilibrium ( without pumping ) at which @xmath29 and @xmath30 . at the pumping of an intrinsic gl structure , @xmath31 , where generally @xmath32 . under these conditions , the quasi - fermi energy @xmath33 in the i - section ( neglecting the leakage and recombination in the lowest approximation ) , is given by [ see fig .  2(b ) ]    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the electron charge .",
    "the terminal current between the side contacts ( per unit length in the lateral direction perpendicular to the current ) , which coincides with the recombination current , is given by    @xmath36    the rate of the optical phonon - assisted interband transitions ( recombination rate ) @xmath37 and the rate of the intraband energy relaxation associated with optical phonons @xmath38 can be calculated using the following simplified formulas  @xcite ( see , also ref .",

    "due to contributions of the recombination and injection to the energy balance of the electro - hole plasma in the i - section , the electron - hole effective temperature @xmath4 can deviate from the lattice temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the number of optical phonons @xmath45 can also be different from its equilibrium value @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath6 is large , in a wide range of temperatures ( including the room temperatures ) @xmath53    the electron - hole plasma gives up the energy @xmath6 in each act of the optical phonon emission ( interband and intraband ) and receives the same energy absorbing an optical phonon .",
    "hence , the net rate of the energy transfer from and to the electron hole - plasma due to the inreaction with optical phonons is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "considering eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) and taking into account that the joule power associated with the injection current is equal to @xmath55 , an equation governing the energy balance in the electron - hole plasma in the i - section can be presented as    @xmath56\\ ] ] @xmath57\\ ] ] @xmath58.\\ ] ] here the left - hand side corresponds to the power received by the electron - hole plasma in the i - section from the pumping source , whereas the right - hand side correspond to the power transferred to or received from the optical phonon system .",
    "the number of optical phonons is governed by an equation which describes the balance between their generation in the interband and intraband transitions and decay due to the anharmonic contributions to the interatomic potential , leading to the phonon - phonon scattering and in the decay of optical phonons into acoustic phonons .",
    "this equation can be presented in the form @xmath59\\ ] ] @xmath60,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the optical phonon decay time .",
    "this time can be markedly longer than @xmath42 and @xmath43 , particularly in suspended gls , so that parameter @xmath62 can exceed or substantially exceed unity .",

    "if so , the situation when @xmath63 appears also to be feasible .",
    "the optical phonon decay time might be fairly short depending on the type of the substrate .    instead of eq .",

    ", the thermionic leakage current dominates over the tunneling leakage current , and the latter is disregarded in the following estimates .    taking into account the height of the barrier @xmath174 , for the contribution of thermionic current through the junctions to the net terminal current one can obtain @xmath175\\ ] ] @xmath176.\\ ] ] here @xmath177 . comparing @xmath93 and @xmath178 given by eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 24 ) , respectively , one can conclude that the leakage ( thermionic ) current is small in comparison with the current associated with the optical phonon recombination if @xmath179 or @xmath180.\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath181  s , factor @xmath182 in eq .",
    "( 21 ) is small when the length of the i - section @xmath183 m , i.e. , at fairly practical values of @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , neglect of the thermionic leakage in our calculations in the above sections is justified when @xmath184  ev ( more precisely when @xmath185 ) . at @xmath186 ,",
    "the latter inequality means that the donor and acceptor density in the pertinent sections should be @xmath187    in the case of the devices with the electrically - induced p- and n - section , the analogous condition sounds as    @xmath188    setting @xmath189 and @xmath190  nm , the latter condition corresponds to @xmath191  v.    at a strong heating of the electron - hole plasma , say , at @xmath95 , using eq .",
    "( 15 ) , condition  ( 25 ) is replaced by    @xmath192    the latter inequality can impose somewhat stricter limitation on the values of @xmath28 and @xmath14 than those given by eqs .",
    "( 25 ) and ( 26 ) if @xmath193 .",
    "it is notable that an effective confinement of the injected electrons and holes in the i - section by the barriers at p - i- and i - n - junctions in the gl structures under consideration can be realized by relatively low doping levels in p- and n - sections in comparison with structures with two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron plasma in quantum wells on the base of the standard semiconductors .",
    "indeed , the barrier height at @xmath24 in the doped section of gl is equal to @xmath194 . in standard 2d systems with the electron effective mass @xmath195 and the energy gap @xmath196 ,",
    "the barrier height is equal to @xmath197 , where @xmath198 . to achieve the same value of the quasi - fermi energy @xmath33 in the standard 2d system as in gls",
    ", one needs to apply the voltage @xmath199 . to provide , for example , the values @xmath200  ev , one needs @xmath201  @xmath48 and @xmath202  @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "thus , in the standard 2d electron systems the doping should be five times higher ( for @xmath203  g ) .",
    "this is due to lower density of states in massless gls near the dirac point compared to that in the standard 2d structures with @xmath204 . since the effective mass of holes @xmath205 in the standard semiconductors is markedly larger than @xmath195 , the realization of the barrier height at the p - i - junction sufficient for the effective confinement of electrons at elevated temperatures requires fairly heavy doping .",
    "thus , in contrast to the standard 2d structures , the thermionic leakage current in the gl or mgl p - i - n structures under consideration can be sufficiently small without the employment of wide - gap p- and n - sections .",
    "in passing it should be mentioned that an extra confinement of the injected electrons and holes can be achieved if the p- and n - sections constitute arrays of graphene nanowires ( doped or with electrically - induced high electron an hole densities ) , so that the p - i - n structures considered above are replaced by the p - i - n structures .",
    "one needs to stress that the assumptions ( used in the above model ) that the electron - hole plasma in the active region is virtually uniform as well as that the recombination current exceeds the leakage current are rather common in simplified models ( the so - called rate - equation models ) of in standard injection laser structures with the double injection ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as follows from the above calculations , the effective electron - hole and optical phonon temperature can be very high at @xmath206 and be accompanied by effects associated with the @xmath132-shape characteristics . in this case ,",
    "an expression for the rate of optical phonon decay @xmath207 used in eq .",
    "( 7 ) might be oversimplified due to a strong anharmonism of the lattice vibration .",
    "possibly , the effects related to a strong anharmonism can be taken into account by a proper choice ( renormalization ) of parameters @xmath61 and @xmath105 . in the above treatment , for simplicity only one type of optical phonons with",
    "@xmath8  ev was taken in to account .",
    "however , due to closeness of the optical phonon frequencies of different type in gls and mgls , the pertinent generalization of the model , adding computational complexity , should not lead to a marked change in the obtained results .",
    "apart from this , at large effective temperatures , the radiative recombination and cooling ( due to the radiative transfer of the energy outside the structure ) can become essential  @xcite , resulting in a limitation of these temperatures and affecting the @xmath132-shape dependences .",
    "this means that considering the range or relatively high applied voltages and , hence , strong injection , our purely `` optical phonon '' model should be generalized .",
    "however , this concerns not particularly interesting situations in which the dynamic conductivity is not negative .",
    "as demonstrated , the main potential obstacles in the realization of negative dynamic conductivity and thz lasing in the injection gl and mgl structures at the room ( or slightly lower ) temperatures might be the intraband photon ( drude ) absorption and the optical phonon heating .",
    "these effects are characterized by parameters @xmath208 and @xmath209 , respectively . as for parameter @xmath210 , it can be sufficiently small in perfect mgl structures like those studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , so the problem of intraband absorption can be overcome .",
    "however , if real values of parameter @xmath105 can not be decreased to an appropriate level ( @xmath211 ) , the achievement of room temperature thz lasing in the structures under consideration might meet problems .",
    "in the case of such a scenario , the utilization of lower temperatures , at which the recombination and energy relaxation is associated with different mechanisms , can become indispensable .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied theoretically the effect of population inversion associated with the electron and hole injection in gl and mgl p - i - n structures at the room and slightly lower temperatures when the interaction with optical phonons is the main mechanism of the recombination and energy relaxation . in the framework of the developed model , the electron - hole and optical phonon effective temperatures and the current - voltage characteristics",
    "have been calculated as functions of the applied voltage and the structure parameters .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the injection can lead to cooling of the injected electron - hole plasma in the device i - section to the temperatures lower than the lattice temperature at low and moderate voltages , whereas the voltage dependences can be ambiguous exhibiting the s - shape behavior at elevated voltages .",
    "the variations of the electron - hole effective temperature with increasing applied voltage are accompanied with an increase in the optical phonon effective temperature . using the obtained voltage dependences , we have calculated the dynamic conductivity and estimated the ranges parameters and signal thz frequencies where this conductivity is negative .",
    "the electron - hole cooling might substantially promote the realization of thz lasing at elevated ambient temperatures . in summary",
    ", we believe that the obtained results instill confidence in the future of graphene - based injection thz lasers although their realization might require a thorough optimization .",
