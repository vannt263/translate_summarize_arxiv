    "the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey @xcite is currently the prime resource for galactic h  survey data .",
    "lab comprises data from the leiden dwingeloo survey ( lds ) , @xcite , ( beam width at full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath9 ) and from the survey of the instituto argentino de radioastronoma ( iar ) , @xcite ( fwhm @xmath10 ) .",
    "this survey provides information for a broad range of applications , ranging from cosmology to milky way research .",
    "its success is based on the high reliability of the lab data .",
    "lab is the first hi full - sky survey comprising high quality flux calibration , radio  frequency interference ( rfi ) mitigation and most importantly , a correction of a major instrumental problem of single dish radio telescopes , the stray radiation @xcite .",
    "though , the lab survey has some shortcomings .",
    "the angular resolution is only moderate and even worse : the hi sky is not fully nyquist sampled @xcite .    within the last few years",
    ", major efforts have been made to use two of the world s largest single dish radio telescopes for a new galactic all sky h  survey ; on the southern hemisphere the parkes telescope and the on the northern hemisphere the effelsberg telescope . for declinations",
    "@xmath11 , the galactic all sky survey ( gass ) was first published by @xcite , the second data release ( gass ii ) includes corrections for stray radiation @xcite .",
    "recently it was superseded by the third data release ( gass iii ) with improved performance after removal of residual instrumental problems @xcite .",
    "the first data release of the galactic portion of the effelsberg bonn h  survey ( ebhis ) just became available @xcite .",
    "gass iii and ebhis were prepared in parallel in bonn aiming to be merged to a common all sky h  survey .",
    "it is then mandatory to evaluate the performance of the _ common _ data product . as a first test",
    "we have chosen a topic that is sensitive to residual instrumental problems . at the same time",
    "we have selected a theme that is interesting on its own , turbulent structures and filaments in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "here we use the term `` filament '' to describe `` a single thread or a thin flexible threadlike object '' ( merriam - webster ) .",
    "the observed filaments are projections of 3-d objects onto the plane of the sky .",
    "we describe these features `` as seen '' without any constrains on the detailed geometry .    already in 1994 ,",
    "when the northern part of the lab , the lds , became available @xcite , henk van de hulst pointed out ( private communication ) that such features of the h  distribution are probably best appropriate for a large scale characterization of turbulent structures in the ism .",
    "unsharp masking ( usm ) is a technique to enhance the contrast of small scale features while suppressing large scale features .",
    "a spatially smoothed representation of the area of interest is calculated and subtracted from the original data product .",
    "digital - imaging software packages like adobe photoshop and gimp use this method to enhance partly contrast and sharpness of an image .",
    "here we use the usm technique to demonstrate what is gained by using the world s largest radio telescopes for a galactic h  survey in comparison to the well established lab survey .",
    "using the usm techniques allows to investigate the spatial distribution and to perform a parameterization of h  filaments across the whole sky .",
    "usm techniques with partly stunning results were applied first in astronomy by @xcite as an analogous photographic masking technique to enhance pictures of faint nebulosities . using digital data processing , @xcite were the first to apply the usm technique in radio astronomy .",
    "they successfully applied a gaussian smoothing to determine scanning effects .",
    "the width of the smoothing kernel was twice the telescope beam .",
    "usm techniques can only be applied to remove additive effects , e.g. emission of the atmosphere , and not multiplicative ones , e.g. caused by gain variations or atmospheric damping .    since",
    "then , usm found a number of applications in astronomy , either to identify instrumental problems or to detect faint sources .",
    "most recently , @xcite applied usm techniques for the characterization of ridges and calculation of the associated excess column densities of polarized dust emission at 353ghz . for the gass , @xcite used among other methods usm to identify residual instrumental problems .",
    "it turned out that usm data show numerous genuine h  filaments that may be mistakenly identified as instrumental artifacts when using median filtering or other automatic rfi excision methods . here",
    "we apply usm methods to demonstrate that gass iii and ebhis discloses a wealth of real h  filaments without suffering from residual instrumental effects that may mimic these structures .",
    "our investigations are timely . a tight correlation between gas and dust",
    "is expected @xcite , but the question arises on what spatial scale this correlation is observed .",
    "moreover , does the h  gas correlate with the magnetized interstellar medium ?",
    "very recently , _",
    "planck _ all - sky maps of the linearly polarized dust emission at 353ghz became available .",
    "this data reveals that dust - ridges in the total intensity maps have their counterparts in the corresponding stokes q and/or u maps , suggesting that the dusty interstellar medium is physically related to the magnetized medium @xcite . while the diffuse ism appears to be aligned to the magnetic field lines of forces , towards the cold molecular gas phase a perpendicular orientation",
    "is observed .",
    "the polarization angle displays a coherent well ordered pattern across extended areas of several square degrees , intercepted by individual filamentary structures @xcite . to investigate the question , how far filaments are affected by interstellar turbulence , polarized thermal emission from galactic dust",
    "was compared with magneto hydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations @xcite .",
    "previous radio astronomical investigations concerning a relation between h  gas and magnetic fields are based primarily on zeeman splitting observations in interstellar h  clouds observed first by @xcite in absorption against cas a and tau a. observations of the zeeman splitting are challenging because of the complex antenna characteristics of radio telescopes .",
    "the arecibo millennium survey took nearly 1000 hours of telescope time but yielded only 22 detections with a 2.5 @xmath12 signal out of 69 measured sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite comprise in their review the most recent results .",
    "their conclusions are based mainly on statistical evidence that the large scale magnetic field appears to be in equipartition with turbulent motions in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) .",
    "the median total magnetic field strength is determined to @xmath13 g .",
    "further evidence for a close association between gas and magnetic fields came very recently from the galactic arecibo l - band feed array h  ( galfa - h ) survey .",
    "@xcite detected slender , linear h  features , denoted as `` fibers '' , that extend across many degrees at the high galactic latitude sky .",
    "these fibers are oriented parallel to the magnetic field lines .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that these fibers trace dust polarization angles .",
    "for the southern sky we use the gass iii data release @xcite which was proven to be affected at most at a very low level by correlator problems and rfi that might mimic filamentary features . for the northern sky we use data from the first ebhis data release @xcite .    for both surveys independent databases on a common healpix grid @xcite were generated by gridding the spectra that were observed on - the - fly to a common nside = 1024 data structure .",
    "on such a grid the formal healpix angular resolution is 344 per pixel , on the equator the pixel separation is 532 .",
    "compared to the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) beam - size of 108 for the ebhis and 162 for gass iii this database provides an adequate sampling @xcite .",
    "the rms uncertainties of the brightness temperatures per channel are 90mk for ebhis at a fwhm width of @xmath14 kms@xmath15and 57mk at @xmath16 kms@xmath15for gass .",
    "when analyzing filaments extracted by usm we are eventually going to use only data with brightness temperatures in excess of 1 k ( partly 0.3 k or even lower ) , corresponding to a brightness temperature threshold of @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 ) . in any case the derived structures can safely be considered to be unaffected by residual instrumental problems @xcite .    for both surveys we generate independently a smooth database by applying a gaussian convolution resulting in an effective fwhm beam size of 30 .",
    "the ebhis covers declination @xmath19 , while for gass the limit is @xmath20 . after smoothing we merge both data sets , using ebhis data for @xmath21 and gass iii data for @xmath22",
    "when merging the original unsmoothed brightness temperature databases we are faced with the problem that both surveys have a different spatial resolution . using a hard transition as before at @xmath23 leads to unavoidable discontinuities .",
    "we therefore apply a linear interpolation in angular resolution between @xmath24 from 162 ( gass ) to 108 ( ebhis ) .",
    "ebhis and gass are observed on a different velocity grid . to combine the data we need to define a common velocity grid .",
    "here we have chosen for convenience the lab velocities with a channel spacing of 1.03 kms@xmath1 . to resample the data we used a cubic spline interpolation .",
    "subsequent to the calculation of a common healpix databases for both telescopes we generate an usm database by subtracting previously smoothed data from the unsmoothed ones .",
    "the usm maps display only the high spatial frequencies ( small - scale structure ) of the objects of interest ; spatial frequencies lower than the smoothing kernel of @xmath25 ( large - scale structures ) are suppressed .",
    "we are interested to study small scale h  structures on angular scales between 11   ( ebhis ) to 16   ( gass ) , the highest angular resolution that is provided by all - sky surveys using two of the world s largest single dish radio telescopes .",
    "we suppressed hi structures spatially larger than 30 .",
    "a gaussian smoothing kernel was chosen since it is non - negative and non - oscillating , hence it causes no overshoot or ringing .",
    "in fact , we blur the data and drop all the information on extended h  structures that lab provides .",
    "these so far only marginally explored hi filamentary features at high spatial frequencies as presented in detail below .",
    "we aim here to derive parameters for the global all sky distribution of local gas .",
    "figures [ fig_filaments1 ] , [ fig_filaments1b ] , and [ fig_filaments1c ] display three examples .",
    "all sky brightness temperature channel maps are displayed in the top panel in mollweide projection for the radial velocities of @xmath26 kms@xmath1   ( fig .",
    "[ fig_filaments1 ] ) , @xmath27 kms@xmath1   ( fig . [ fig_filaments1b ] ) and + 8 kms@xmath1   ( fig . [ fig_filaments1c ] ) .",
    "usm data that emphasize small scale h  fluctuations are given in the lower panels .",
    "visual inspection of these channel maps discloses that the usm data in general display only filamentary structures that change significantly in both , position and brightness temperature from channel to channel , implying that the line width of the h  gas under investigation is comparable to the velocity resolution ( channel spacing ) of the hi survey data .",
    "such narrow line widths correspond to low kinetic gas temperatures @xmath28k .",
    "thus , the filaments are physically associated with h  gas belonging to the cnm @xcite .",
    "contrarily , inspecting the observed brightness temperature maps channel by channel shows only minor changes .",
    "these maps are dominated by the spatially more extended warm neutral medium ( wnm ) .",
    "we interpret the usm features as an indication that the cold filamentary structures are in brightness temperature superimposed to the wnm , perhaps also embedded in it .",
    "whenever we inspect the location of a cold filamentary structures in the usm maps we find corresponding features in the original brightness temperature maps .",
    "the opposite search fails in the majority of the cases , even for features that appear visually as unique hi filaments .    inspecting individual regions at various velocities we often find multiple filaments towards the same area of interest .",
    "these filaments reveal for different radial velocities different orientations at the sky .",
    "obviously we are faced with a wealth of cold filaments showing up in the usm maps .",
    "given the wealth of filamentary features visible in fig .",
    "[ fig_filaments1 ] ( and figs .",
    "[ fig_filaments1b ] and [ fig_filaments1c ] in the appendix ) we obviously need to restrict our analysis to the most prominent ones .",
    "we therefore applied the following algorithm to search for major filaments : for each position we check at all velocities @xmath0 kms@xmath15for a positive peak @xmath29 in the usm database .",
    "in addition to the strength of the usm peak we record its velocity @xmath30 and the corresponding unsmoothed brightness temperature @xmath31 at that velocity .",
    "we use the subscript `` on '' to denote that this parameter is `` on source '' in position @xmath32 and velocity @xmath33 ; @xmath31 is at the same ( @xmath34 ) position as @xmath35 .",
    "we trace for each position the usm features in velocity as long as the intensities remain positive in the usm data base .",
    "this allows us to determine the column density @xmath36 and the fwhm velocity width @xmath37 .    from @xmath37",
    "we derive doppler temperatures @xmath38 ( * ? ? ?",
    "this temperature is derived from the observed fwhm line width , corrected for instrumental broadening , and is a measure for an upper limit of the kinetic temperature @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "line broadening is caused by a superposition of turbulent motions with @xmath40 @xcite and bulk motions along the line of sight . only in case of a negligible contribution of the turbulent component both temperatures would approach each other , @xmath41 . in sect .",
    "[ environment ] we discuss line of sight effects that cause a broadening of observed wnm emission lines .",
    "turbulent line broadening , affecting cnm components , is discussed in sect .",
    "[ width ] .    for h  gas in equilibrium ,",
    "the kinetic temperature is related to the spin temperature , which is just the excitation temperature of the hyperfine levels evaluated according to the boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "due to its long life time , the 21-cm transition is usually collisionally excited , and the spin temperature of the gas is a measure for the kinetic temperature . according to @xcite the term spin temperature",
    "is defined for temperatures derived from absorption lines while kinetic temperatures are determined from the width of h  lines in thermal motion .",
    "@xcite have used the ( galfa - h ) survey and the first gass data release @xcite to search for filamentary h  features . in both cases",
    "the h  data are not corrected for stray radiation .",
    "we note also that gass data prior to the third data release @xcite may suffer from residual correlator problems .",
    "these can cause artificial linear structures oriented in scanning direction ; for details see @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the rolling hough transform ( rht ) , a machine vision method for parameterizing the coherent linearity of structures in the image plane .",
    "the rht initially was designed for detection of complex patterns in bubble chamber photographs .",
    "the first step in this case is also to apply usm to the image .",
    "the image is convolved with a two - dimensional tophat smoothing kernel of a user - defined diameter , dk = 10   or 15   for arecibo , and dk = 53   for parkes data .",
    "different in our analysis is that we use a gaussian smoothing kernel to convolve effelsberg and parkes data to an effective resolution of 30   for both surveys .",
    "after subtracting the smoothed data from the original observations , @xcite threshold the data at a 70% level to obtain a bit mask .",
    "the derived features , called fibers , with a smooth coherent structure and curvature , extend typically across angular scales of a few degrees . in the next step of the analysis the position angle is determined to allow a detailed comparison with the polarization angles of the reflected stellar light and magnetic field directions .",
    "several fibers may exist at individual positions , crossing each other ( figs . 3 and 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to derive a projected rht field direction , @xcite average stokes parameters derived at different velocities",
    "our focus here is different , we are going to identify the all - sky distribution of the major h  filaments without modifying the filaments brightness temperature characteristics traced by its curvature or restricting their angular length .",
    "for each position we consider only the brightest h  filament towards each individual line of sight .",
    "we do not aim to determine position angles here .",
    "figure [ fig_filaments2 ] displays the results of our analysis in comparison to dust emission and polarization measured by _ planck_. the top panel displays the dust emission from the hfi skymap at 353 ghz ( i_stokes from the public available hfi_skymap_353_2048_r2.00_full.fits in units of mjy sr@xmath1 ) . in the middle panel the brightness temperatures @xmath31 of the major h  filaments are displayed .",
    "this is a presentation of the h  emission from the gas that hosts the major filaments that we find in the usm analysis .",

    "[ fig_filaments2 ] shows for comparison a composite map of the dust emission as observed by _ planck _ at 353 ghz .",
    "superimposed is a texture derived from the measurements of the orientation of the polarized light emitted by the dust , which in turn indicates the orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the map is from http://www.esa.int / spaceinimages / images/2015/02/.    visually the upper two maps show a high degree of correlation between @xmath42 and dust emission except for h  filaments close to the galactic plane and in regions with very luminous h  emission .",
    "the lower map displays the global distribution of magnetic fields , in most cases visually aligned by h  and dust filaments .",
    "many of the fainter h  filaments show even in details a high degree of correlation between magnetic field lines an the h  brightness temperature ( see sect.[details ] in particular figs.[fig_detail1 ] and [ fig_detail2 ] ) .",
    "the general impression is that h  ridges are in most cases better defined with more detailed substructures than the emission from dust ( top ) . because of h  substructures , h  filaments appear to disclose a higher degree of correlation with the magnetic field lines than the _",
    "map at the top .      for a more detailed comparison between h  and dust maps",
    "we inspect two interesting regions with prominent filamentary structures . figs .",
    "[ fig_detail1 ] and [ fig_detail2 ] give detailed presentations at @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "it is obvious that the usm h  data disclose more details at a lower sensitivity limit . despite the lower angular resolution of the h  data",
    "the h  reveals much finer details .",
    "next to the major ridges we frequently find striations . the dust intensity map displays a more diffuse distribution . here , towards the faintest portions of the _ planck _ 353ghz map we identify intensity fluctuations caused by the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "towards the bright far infrared emission the apparent lack of small  scale structure of the _ planck _ data is most likely that the far  infrared emission correlates quantitatively with both , the wnm and cnm .",
    "using usm techniques allows us to determine the velocity where the cnm filament is most prominent .",
    "this defines @xmath31 ( see sect . [ deriving ] ) and allows to trace the filament , even in case of velocity gradients .",
    "alternatively , an unbound integration over the line of sight would add contributions from unrelated h  gas .",
    "so , the _ planck _",
    "fir continuum data is indeed limited by the angular resolution of the satellite dishes while the radial velocity information of the single dish h  surveys allows to differentiate between the wnm and cnm structures .",
    "in the following we will parameterize the properties of filamentary structures .",
    "figure [ fig_filaments3 ] and [ fig_filaments3b ] gives an all sky overview and displays in the top panel the principal curvature image of the @xmath42 distribution derived by us .",
    "below we plot column densities @xmath47 for @xmath35 , next the derived doppler temperatures on logarithmic scale , lg@xmath48 ( see sect . [ deriving ] for definition of @xmath49 ) , and at the bottom the velocity field of the filaments . in all cases",
    "we find well defined structures .",
    "the purpose of this fig .",
    "is only to highlight global features .",
    "all details will be discussed in turn .      using the usm algorithm ,",
    "we have derived a map of filamentary structures .",
    "now we discuss whether these structures may also be called filaments in the sense of image analysis .    to classify the curvature of a feature within an intensity map along any direction ,",

    "the eigenvalues of h , @xmath57 are often denoted as principal directions and describe the local curvature of the features ; @xmath58 is in direction of least curvature .",
    "we determine the derivatives for @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_filaments2 ] , middle panel ) from symmetric differential quotients . due to the interleaved structure of the healpix database",
    "it is necessary to interpolate the gridded data in galactic longitudes , we use a cubic spline interpolation .",

    "[ fig_filaments2 ] and may be compared with fig .",
    "3 of @xcite .",
    "the hessian analysis is sensitive to point - to - point fluctuations .",
    "the noisy blue dotted regions close to the galactic plane indicate that our basic concept , to define major filaments that are dominating the h  distribution , approaches its limits towards low galactic latitudes .",
    "this does not imply that there are no well defined filaments in the galactic plane .",
    "the opposite is true , there are too many filaments that overlay each other , causing confusion .",
    "figure [ plane ] shows as an example an extended region centered at longitude @xmath59 at a velocity of 5 kms@xmath1 . to the left we plot the observed brightness temperature , to the right the usm image .",
    "this region shows numerous filaments crossing each other . even within a single spectral channel",
    "the confusion is severe .",
    "it is worth to note several prominent diagonal features that are due to h  self - absorption .",
    "close to the galactic center position is the riegel - crutcher cloud @xcite , another structure , almost parallel to the the riegel - crutcher cloud , is at @xmath60 and at @xmath61 .",
    "these structures are dark because the h  is optically thick , leading to self - absorption .",
    "we conclude that the confusion in the principal curvature image is caused by confusion from crowded h  filaments that are superposing each other .",

    "the scale height of this gas is limited , hence the observed features are relatively simple with a low probability of confusion . however , for comparison we give also values for the whole sky , to demonstrate that the local interstellar medium at @xmath62 represents well the full sky h  gas distribution .",

    "a more detailed discussion on velocity gradients is given in sect .",
    "[ orientation ] .",
    "detailed usm channel maps , showing velocity gradients , are given in the appendix .",
    "we use fig .",
    "[ fig_orientation ] to discuss the observed orientation of filaments with respect to the galactic plane .",
    "close to the plane it is not easy to identify regions of low confusion levels .",
    "this example was chosen to demonstrate that most of the filaments have thin arc - like structures but may run in different directions .",
    "close to the galactic plane we find filaments without preferred directions . off the plane , here roughly at @xmath63 , we find filaments that are bent convex , suggestive for an activity of blast waves originating from supernovae in the plane .",
    "figure [ fig_filament ] displays details of a pair of filaments located within fig .",
    "[ fig_orientation ] ; both filaments having a length of approximately @xmath64 . tracing these features shows that they develop subsequently in position - velocity space .",
    "the ridges appear to move from channel to channel somewhat less then a beam width , in total 05 over 5 kms@xmath1   before they disintegrate .",
    "apparent position shifts of h  structures with channel velocity can be caused by systematic velocity shifts of the gas within a more extended distribution , e.g. as for rotation curves of galaxies .",
    "significant position changes from one channel to the next , however , can then only be observed for a sufficiently low velocity dispersion of the gas along the line of sight . for a channel spacing around 1.3 kms@xmath1",
    "this implies that the doppler temperature within the gas layer has to be @xmath65 k. the corresponding fwhm for turbulent motions in velocity is @xmath66 kms@xmath1 , only a factor two to five lower than the total correlation width @xmath67 kms@xmath1   that limits the observability of the filaments ( see more examples in the appendix ) .",
    "outside this velocity range the left - over fragments barely resemble a filamentary origin .",
    "filamentary features of this kind have been described as `` morphologically obvious structures '' by @xcite ; meaning fibers ( strings ) or edge - on sheets . but how to distinguish between fibers and sheets ?",
    "fibers in the ism may be caused by sub - alfvenic anisotropic turbulence @xcite . in simulations",
    "such filaments are found to be aligned along the magnetic field lines .",
    "that is what we observe but it is unclear how such a model could explain an apparent _ continuous _ position shift with velocity .    @xcite studied non - self - gravitating filaments in the ism .",
    "he used mhd simulations to study the formation of clumps in various conditions .",
    "it was found that filaments are in general preferentially aligned with the strain due to the stretch induced by turbulence .",
    "these filaments survive longer in case of magnetized flows .",
    "a strain must affect bulk velocities within filaments . in this case",
    "the velocity gradient is along the filament .",
    "according to @xcite edge - on sheets should be edge - on seen shocks in which the field is parallel to the sheet .",

    "figures [ fig_orientation ] and [ fig_filament ] suggest that the filaments are caused by blast waves originating from the galactic plane .",

    "the full - sky single dish hi surveys allow for the first time to establish a complete census of the local cnm .",
    "all high galactic latitude filaments , but also the the bulk of the gas located close to the galactic plane , share a common set of physical parameters describing the ism conditions .",

    "we find for the whole sample a gaussian velocity distribution , centered at @xmath239 kms@xmath1 , with a fwhm spread of @xmath219 kms@xmath1 . on large scales filaments have frequently companion features at similar velocities .",
    "we find some usm structures that can not be described as obvious filaments .",
    "partly such fragments look like disintegrated features from filaments , partly they may be caused by projection effects , as a result of apparently crossing filaments .",
    "in fact , any geometry is possible ; i.e. the spider ( * ? ? ?",
    "9 & 13 ) is caused by several crossing filaments , easily traceable in the usm channel maps .",
    "using usm with a fixed gaussian smoothing kernel ( effective fwhm of @xmath240 ) may cause biases in the analysis because spatial frequencies corresponding to the fwhm beam sizes of the parkes and effelsberg telescopes are preferred .",
    "all derived parameters were compared with those by @xcite who used predominantly arecibo data for their analysis . in all cases we found excellent agreement .",
    "the methods that have been used by this team are very different from ours .",
    "this implies that neither our analysis nor that of @xcite are strongly affected by systematical effects .",
    "also there is no recognizable dependence on telescope size or spatial resolution .",
    "arecibo is far ahead with respect to the beam width and velocity resolution but unfortunately restricted with respect to the observable portion of the sky .",
    "the most striking result from our investigation is the large number of extended cold coherent filamentary structures that we observe .",
    "a number of these features reach angular scales of @xmath241 , implying a total length of @xmath242 pc at an assumed distance of 100 pc .",
    "cnm sheets of this kind were previously observed and discussed by @xcite .",
    "a median sheet width of 0.09 pc implies length - to - thickness aspect ratios up to 400 or more . for comparison ,",
    "the edge - on aspect ratio of a cd is 100 .",
    "the two - phase model is based on observational evidence that the cnm is embedded in the wnm , giving rise to the so called `` raisin pudding '' model @xcite .",
    "our data imply that the cnm clouds are very different from standard clouds @xcite or `` raisins '' @xcite .",
    "what we observe are rather `` steamrollered raisins '' , flatter than a cd , and warped by a turbulent ism .",
