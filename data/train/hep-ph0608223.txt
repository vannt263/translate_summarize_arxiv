    "since the lhc will produce top quarks copiously and allow a precision test of top quark nature , it will either uncover or stringently constrain the new physics related to the top quark @xcite .    as a popular candidate for new physics",
    ", the tev - scale supersymmetry can sizably alter some of the top quark properties .",
    "for example , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) can significantly enhance the top quark flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) interactions @xcite and thus make the top quark fcnc processes possiblly observable at the lhc .",
    "it is well known that in the mssm , a discrete multiplicative symmetry of @xmath4-parity , defined by @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 , baryon number @xmath7 and lepton number @xmath8 , is often imposed on the lagrangian to maintain the separate conservation of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "since such a conservation requirement is not dictated by any fundamental principle such as gauge invariance or renormalizability , the phenomenology of @xmath4-parity violation has attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "so far as the top quark physics at the lhc , @xmath4-parity violation can cause some exotic top quark processes like the @xmath9-channel single top production and the decays via exchanging a squark or slepton @xcite    note that the r - parity violating interactions can also induce new mechanisms for top pair productions at the lhc through the @xmath0-channel process @xmath1 by exchanging a slepton or @xmath2-channel process @xmath3 by exchanging a squark .",

    "@xmath10 cross section is unobservably as small as a few percent @xcite , they may induce a sizable asymmetry between the left- and right - handed polarized top quarks due to the chiral nature of these couplings . in @xcite",
    "such induced polarization in the top pair events is studied for the tevatron collider and turns out to be a sensitive probe for these couplings due to the fact that both the sm and @xmath4-conserving mssm contributions to the polarization are unobservably small @xcite . since the upcoming lhc will overwhelmingly outclass the tevatron for the study of top quark physics , in this work we extend the analysis of @xcite to the lhc .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec-2 ] we briefly describe our calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] we present some numerical results and give some discussions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec-4 ] we give our conclusions .",
    "the @xmath4-violating interactions in the superpotential of the mssm are given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the higgs chiral superfields , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet and singlet chiral superfields .",
    "the indices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 denote generations and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the color indices . for top pair productions at hadron colliders ,",
    "the lepton number violating couplings @xmath24 can induce the @xmath0-channel process @xmath1 by exchanging a slepton while the baryon number violating couplings @xmath25 can induce the @xmath2-channel process @xmath3 by exchanging a squark , as shown in fig .",
    "the forms of these amplitudes are discussed in some detail in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "it is clear that due to the chiral nature of these couplings , the processes they induced in fig.1 will cause top quark polarization in the @xmath10 events , i.e. , an asymmetry between @xmath26 ( the number of @xmath10 events with positive helicity of @xmath0 ) and @xmath27 ( the number of @xmath10 events with negative helicity of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the observables we will examine are three polarizations : @xmath28 for all @xmath10 events and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) for the @xmath10 events with @xmath0 in the forward ( backward ) hemisphere in the @xmath10 c.m .",
    "frame , defined by @xcite @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the top scattering angle in the @xmath10 c.m .",
    "frame , and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath10 hadronic cross section with positive ( negative ) helicity of @xmath0 , which is obtained by convoluting the parton cross section @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) with the parton distribution functions  @xcite ( in our calculations we assume both the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath37 ) .",
    "note that it may seem naive to define the polarization asymmetry as simply @xmath38 since it would be sizable even when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very small ( say below unity ) .",
    "however , since @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is the total number of @xmath10 events with positive ( negative ) helicity and not the number contributed by new physics alone ( the r - violating contribution will become very small for small r - violating couplings and heavy sfermions involved ) , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very large numbers at the lhc due to the large qcd @xmath10 production cross section and high luminosity of the lhc . of course , as will be discussed when we consider the statistical sensitivity in next section , @xmath26 and @xmath27 will be suppressed by the detection efficiency .",
    "but even so , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very large since the lhc can produce @xmath10 copiously and can serve as a top - quark factory .",
    "also , as will be discussed at the end of this section , although @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very large numbers , the asymmetry @xmath38 is very small in the sm because the sm @xmath10 production is dominated by qcd processes which predict @xmath39 . for this reason",
    ", this asymmetry will be a sensitive probe for any new physics which can predict a sizable difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the parton cross section @xmath40 contains the sm contribution @xmath41 and the @xmath4-violating contribution @xmath42 @xmath43 for @xmath41 the dominant contributions are from the qcd processes shown in fig .",
    "it is well known that at the lhc ( tevatron ) the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath44 and quark - antiquark annihilation process @xmath45 contribute about @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath46 ) , respectively .",
    "we assume that the qcd correction factors ( k - factor ) to @xmath42 and @xmath48 take the same value and thus the qcd correction effects cancel in the polarizations defined above .",
    "note that due to the separate @xmath49- and @xmath50-invariance of qcd , the qcd cross section @xmath51 equals to @xmath52 , which are given by @xmath53 for @xmath45 , and @xmath54 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath55 . here",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath4-violating contribution @xmath42 comes from the interference of the diagrams in fig.1 with the corresponding quark - antiquark annihilation qcd diagram in fig .",
    "2 . due to the chiral nature of these @xmath4-violating couplings ,",
    "the cross section with positive helicity of top quark ( @xmath59 ) is not equal to that with negative helicity ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the detailed expressions for @xmath61 and @xmath62 can be found in @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress the reasons to consider the polarization asymmetry in eq.([pt ] ) rather than the _ total _ @xmath10 cross section in probing the r - violating couplings :    * this polarization asymmetry will be a sensitive probe for new physics due to the fact that the sm contribution to this polarization asymmetry is very small ( below @xmath63 ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 productions at the lhc are dominated by the qcd processes shown in fig .",
    "2 . of course , if we only consider the qcd interactions in the @xmath10 productions , the polarization asymmetry in eq.([pt ] ) is zero due to the separate @xmath49- and @xmath50-invariance of qcd .",
    "the sm electroweak process @xmath64 can cause a non - zero polarization asymmetry .",
    "but the polarization caused by this process is very small  @xcite since it does not interfere with the qcd amplitude because of the orthogonal color structure . furthermore , the polarization caused by the sm electroweak loop corrections to the qcd @xmath10 production processes is also very small  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observation of a sizable polarization asymmetry ( say @xmath65 ) will serve as a robust evidence for new physics . *",
    "the r - conserving supersymmetric contribution to this polarization asymmetry is also very small @xcite .",
    "so , if supersymmetry is the true story , only r - violating couplings can cause a sizable value for the polarization asymmetry , which makes it a unique probe for r - violating couplings . *",
    "although the r - violating couplings can contribute to the _ total _",
    "@xmath10 cross section by a few percent @xcite , such correction effects of a few percent are hard to be disentangled from the measurement of the @xmath10 cross section because of the uncertainties in the sm predictions of the @xmath66 production cross section and the possible loop contributions from the r - conserving mssm interactions  @xcite .",
    "in our numerical calculations the top quark mass @xmath67 gev , and the center - of - mass energy for the lhc ( tevatron ) @xmath68 tev ( 2 tev ) .",
    "we assume that only one of the involved @xmath4-violating couplings dominates . for the @xmath8-violating couplings",
    "@xmath24 , we consider the existence of @xmath69 , in which case the stau is exchanged in the process , since @xmath70 and @xmath71 are already strongly constrained by atomic parity violation and @xmath72 deep - inelastic scattering  @xcite . for the @xmath7-violating interactions @xmath25 , none of them have been well constrained by other processes .",
    "so we may interpret our result as that on any one of @xmath25 , in which case the squark @xmath73 is exchanged in the process .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the polarizations @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 normalized to @xmath74 versus the stau mass .",
    "this figure can be also read as @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 normalized to @xmath78 versus the mass of the squark @xmath73 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 interchanged .",
    "the total polarization is smaller than hemisphere polarizations because of the cancellation between the two hemispheres . for the coupling @xmath69 ( @xmath25 ) ,",
    "the backward ( forward ) polarization has the largest magnitude of the three . comparing the lhc results with the tevatron results",
    ", we see that the polarizations at the lhc are smaller .",
    "this can be understood as follows : compared with the tevatron , at the lhc both the difference @xmath79",
    "(= @xmath80 ) and the total cross section @xmath81 increase , but the total cross section increase more significantly since it is dominated by gluon - gluon fusion process .",
    "now we estimate the statistical sensitivity . the statistical error for the top polarization asymmetry defined in eq.([pt ] )",
    "is given by @xmath82^{1/2}}{(n_+ + n_-)^{3/2 } }                 \\simeq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n_+ + n_-}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) is obtained by replacing the above events numbers with those in forward ( backward ) hemisphere .",
    "for the @xmath10 event number in estimating the statistical error we take the assumption @xmath85   \\simeq   \\epsilon   n^{\\rm sm }   = \\epsilon { \\cal l } \\sigma^{\\rm sm}_{t\\bar t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath86 pb ( 6.77 pb ) for the lhc ( tevatron upgrade ) @xcite , @xmath87 being the intergrated luminosity and @xmath88 being the efficiency factor in events counting .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath88 can be writen as @xmath89 with @xmath90 coming respectively from three aspects :    * firstly , as discussed in many previous works @xcite , the helicity states of the top quark may have to be determined from the kinematic distribution of its decay particles @xmath91 ( @xmath92 or @xmath93 ) after reconstructing the top and anti - top quarks in the signal events .",
    "this will immediately lead to a suppression factor @xmath94 . * secondly , as is well known , considering both the detector acceptance and the suppression of the qcd background , some kinematic cuts on the top and anti - top decay particles as well as @xmath95-tagging are necessary . depending on the detailed kinematic cuts and the @xmath95-tagging efficiency ,",
    "the events number is further suppressed by an efficiency factor @xmath96 .",
    "+ for example , if we impose the kinematic selection cuts as @xmath97 gev , @xmath98 , @xmath99 gev and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 denotes the transverse momentum , @xmath102 is the pseudo - rapidity , and @xmath103 is the separation in the azimuthal angle - pseudo rapidity plane @xmath104 between a jet and a lepton or between two jets , then the efficiency from such kinematic cuts is about @xmath105 @xcite . combined with the b - tagging efficiency of about @xmath106 , the efficiency factor @xmath107 .",
    "( currently at tevatron cdf , the efficiency for tagging at least one b - jet in a @xmath10 event is @xmath108 @xcite . at the lhc",
    "we expect an efficiency better than @xmath106 for tagging at least one b - jet in a @xmath10 event . )",
    "+ note that in theoretical analyses we usually impose @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "but for the separation of jets at the lhc , @xmath110 may be over - optimistic and the realistic cut may be @xmath111 . as a result of such a stronger cut , the efficiency factor @xmath112 may drop below @xmath47 . + further , in theoretical analyses we usually imposed @xmath113 @xcite and did not consider the difference of detector efficiency in the different regions of @xmath113 . in practice , the detector efficiency will certainly be quite different in the barrel @xmath114 and endcap @xmath115 regions .",
    "therefore , the realistic value of @xmath96 can only be obtained from detector - dependent full monte carlo simulation .",
    "* thirdly , from analysing the distribution of the leptonic decays of a top quark , we in practice can only know its helicity with some probability @xmath116 .",
    "a recent analysis @xcite gives @xmath117 .",
    "but this figure may be over - optimistic since the analysis @xcite is a theoretical work making rather optimistic assumptions .",
    "as pointed in @xcite , the principal difficulty in measuring top quark polarization comes from the ambiguities in reconstructing its momentum from the decay products , when both top and anti - top decay semileptonically .",
    "the realistic value of @xmath116 may also have to be obtained from detector - dependent full monte carlo simulation .",
    "for the atlas detector an analysis was given in @xcite based on leading - order monte carlo generators and on a fast simulation of the detector .    since @xmath118",
    "are detector - dependent and their realistic values can only be obtained from detector - dependent full monte carlo simulations , in our numerical calculations for statistical significance and statistical limits we only incorporate the suppression factor @xmath119 while leave @xmath118 as variables .",
    "of course , it is straitforward to reinterpret our results once @xmath118 are determined .",
    "we will explicitly point out how to reinterpret our results once @xmath118 are known .",
    "the statistical significances @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 normalized to @xmath74 versus stau mass are shown in fig .",
    "the figure can be also read as the statistical significances normalized to @xmath78 versus the exchanged squark mass with @xmath29 and @xmath30 interchanged .",
    "we see that in case of @xmath69 ( @xmath25 ) the sensitivity of the backward ( forward ) polarization is the best . comparing fig .",
    "3 with fig .",
    "4 , we see that although the polarizations at the lhc are smaller than at the tevatron upgrade , the lhc gives much larger statistical significances due to its much larger @xmath10 sample .    the statistical limits for @xmath69 ( @xmath25 ) versus stau ( squark ) mass are shown in fig .  5 . here for the lhc we show the limits at @xmath123 ( discovery ) , @xmath124 ( evidence ) and @xmath125 ( exclusion ) .",
    "the current @xmath125 exclusion limits from @xmath126 decay at lep  @xcite are also shown for comparison .",
    "we see that the lhc may be quite powerful in probing these @xmath4-violating couplings .",
    "finally , we stress that our above analyses are almost solely theoretical .",
    "we only demonstrated the statistical sensitivity and statistical limits . as is well known , in experiments some systematic errors are inevitable .",
    "such systematic errors are detector - dependent and will certainly worsen the probing limits for the r - violating couplings .",
    "for example , as an artifact of the measurement problems , an apparent polarization asymmetry may arise .",
    "the analysis for the atlas detector showed @xcite that the systematic uncertainties will dominate over the statistical errors after one lhc year at low luminosity ( 10 fb@xmath127 ) .",
    "the analysis in @xcite gives a quite encouraging result , which shows that a percent - level precision on the measurement of the polarization asymmetry between like - spin versus unlike - spin @xmath10 events is possible even with 10 fb@xmath127 .",
    "of course , a higher luminosity ( say 100 fb@xmath127 ) will further enhance the measurement precision .",
    "although the analysis in @xcite did not show the possible measurement precision on our polarization asymmetry @xmath38 , we can expect a similar or even better precision because here we sum over the helicities of the @xmath128 and consider an integrated asymmetry in the numbers of @xmath129 and @xmath130 produced .",
    "in summary , the r - parity violating interactions of the top quark , which have not been well constrained by current experiments , can induce anomalous top pair productions at hadron colliders .",
    "although such induced processes only contribute to the total @xmath10 cross section at the percent level , they can cause top quark polarization in the top pair events due to the chiral nature of these interactions . the polarization can be a useful observable for probing these interactions at the lhc and the upgraded fermilab tevatron collider because the polarization is expected to be very small in the standard model .",
    "we found that at the lhc , due to the large statistics , the statistical significance of the polarization observable and thus the probing ability for the corresponding r - parity violating couplings are much higher than at the tevatron upgrade .",
    "finally , we stress that for the purpose of probing these r - vioalting couplings , there may exist other processes which are complementary to our analyses . for example , @xmath131 couplings can induce @xmath9-channel top - squark productions at the lhc and tevatron and , as studied in @xcite , such productions can be used to probe the parameter space of @xmath131 versus top - squark mass",
