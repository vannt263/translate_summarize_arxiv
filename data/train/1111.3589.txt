    "one might of course anticipate the quadratic dependence on strain rate from symmetry arguments close to equilibrium .",
    "we have shown here that these expressions follow from a time - scale separation caused by an effective confinement .",
    "the effect of the shear flow is to break symmetry and to couple the particle velocity to earlier perturbations perpendicular to its velocity .",
