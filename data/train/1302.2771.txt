    "is accurately described by the exactly solvable jaynes - cummings model [ @xcite ] that employs the rotating wave approximation .",
    "recently , however , a variety of experimental situations pertaining to stronger coupling domain , where the rotating wave approximation no longer remains valid , have been investigated .",

    "one advantage of the superconducting qubits over the natural atoms is the additional flexibility available in selecting the control parameters .",
    "for instance , in the context of cavity electrodynamics usually unbiased qubits operating through their degeneracy points are encountered , whereas the external static bias of the superconducting qubits may be generated and controlled by the gate voltage applied to a cooper - pair box or the magnetic flux linked with a josephson junction [ @xcite ] .    moving beyond the rotating wave approximation in these strongly interacting systems",

    "this facilitates decoupling of the full hamiltonian into sectors related to each time scale , and in this setting approximate eigenstates of the system have been derived [ @xcite ] .",

    "the nonclassical quasi - bell states are found to be of much interest .",
    "they exhibit entanglement of microscopic atomic states and the photonic coherent states that can be regarded as mesoscopic for reasonably large values of the coherent state amplitudes .",
    "when the amplitude of the coherent states are large enough they are often called schrdinger cat states as they exhibit entanglement between a microscopic and a classical object .",
    "experimental observation of these states involving circular rydberg atoms interacting with a mesoscopic coherent field trapped in a high-@xmath0 microwave cavity has been realized [ @xcite ] . in the instance of cavity quantum electrodynamics",
    "they have also been used [ @xcite ] for generating even or odd coherent states as well as more generalized configurations of macroscopic field superposition states .",
    "bell inequality tests involving these qubit - field entangled states have been proposed [ @xcite ] recently .",
    "these states also play a crucial role in the non - destructive measurement [ @xcite ] of the photon number in a field stored in a cavity .",

    "these states are likely to be fruitful for studying quantum phase transitions of qubit - oscillator systems .",
    "therefore , we consider it is of importance to study the dynamical evolution of such a state in a strongly coupled qubit - oscillator system . in particular , the phase - space dynamics of the oscillator may shed light on the macroscopic quantum state .",
    "our objective in the present work is twofold . within the adiabatic approximation scheme we analytically study the evolution of quasi - bell states in a coupled qubit - oscillator system possessing a dominant oscillator frequency and an external static bias of the qubit .",

    "starting with a quasi - bell bipartite initial state we obtain the time - evolution of the reduced density matrices of the qubit and the oscillator , respectively .",

    "proceeding further , the reduced density matrix of the oscillator that yields the husimi @xmath0-function [ @xcite ] on the phase space is studied . in the strong coupling regime",
    "we retain up to the quadratic terms in the laguerre polynomials in the phase factors and analytically express the reduced density matrix elements in closed forms via the jacobi theta functions . to evaluate the analytical expressions we treat the bias perturbatively , and retain terms of second order in the expansion parameter .",
    "the summation procedure may , however , be extended to an arbitrary order . employing the @xmath0-distribution",
    "we also express the quadrature variables of the oscillator and the heisenberg uncertainty thereof via linear combinations of jacobi theta functions .",
    "we will later specify the parametric range of validity of our derivation .",
    "in the ultra - strong coupling regime we employ the long - range time as well as the coupling strength dependence of the classical wehrl entropy [ @xcite ] and the complexity [ @xcite ] of the @xmath0-distribution that measure the delocalization of the mixed state of the oscillator reduced density matrix in the phase space .",
    "an analytical evaluation of the complexity of the coupled qubit - oscillator system is developed .",
