    "similar conclusions can be inferred from tunneling and photoemission @xcite , neutron @xcite , specific heat @xcite , thermal conductivity @xcite and other experiments .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to derive eliashberg type @xcite equations valid for the strongly correlated superconductor with electron  phonon interaction . to this end",
    "we assume the validity of migdal @xcite theorem which means that we assume relatively weak electron ",
    "phonon interaction .",
    "the strong correlations described by the hubbard model will be treated via slave boson method .",
    "the derived equations are strongly anisotropic and lead to the possibility of various types of symmetries of order parameter .",
    "the relative stability of various symmetries does depend on the carrier concentration and other parameters .    in section ii we present the model hamiltonian for strongly correlated systems and discuss the application of slave boson approximation to it in the @xmath5 limit , both in mean field and beyond it .",
    "the derivation of the eliashberg equations on the real frequency axis is described in considerable detail in section iii .",
    "section iv contains presentation of results and discussion .",
    "we start with the one band hubbard model with general form of electron ",
    "phonon interaction term @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a spin @xmath8 electron at site @xmath9 of the lattice , @xmath10 is the @xmath2th component of the displacement vector of the ion , @xmath11 , @xmath12 denotes chemical potential , @xmath13 is the hopping integral assumed to take on nonzero value @xmath14 for @xmath15 being nearest neighbour sites , @xmath16 is the hubbard on  site repulsion of carriers .",

    "it is related to the derivative of @xmath13 taken at equilibrium position of an ion @xmath20 the second part of the interaction i.e. the term @xmath21 is connected with fluctuations of the crystal field . due to ionic character of high temperature superconductors this term is expected to be more important and has to be taken into account even if we have assumed the equilibrium value of crystal field @xmath22 to be zero .",
    "the systematic derivation and the discussion of the electron  ion interaction in context of superconducting oxides can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "we are interested in the strong correlation limit , characterised by the large @xmath16 values ( @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the width of electron band in a  two dimensional square lattice ) . in this limit and for less than half filled band ( i.e. concentration of carriers @xmath25 )",
    "it is very inconvenient for two carriers to occupy the same site @xmath9 .",
    "it means that double occupation of sites is prohibited and the dynamics of carriers is limited to empty and singly occupied states .",
    "thus we have to project out all the doubly occupied states of the system .",
    "this procedure is most conveniently carried out with the help of auxiliary particles @xcite and in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "one rewrites the electron operators in ( 1 ) in terms of new fermion operators @xmath26 and auxiliary boson operator @xmath27 as @xmath28 .",
    "the term @xmath16 may then be dropped out at the expense of introducing at each site a  constraint @xmath29 via lagrange multiplier @xmath30 .",
    "the constraint allows for at most single occupation of each size .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eqno1 ] ) then becomes @xmath31 note that on  site terms are not modified .",

    "the hopping of a  real electron from occupied state @xmath33 to an empty state at @xmath9 , described by term @xmath34 in ( [ eqno1 ] ) consists of motion of a  fermion between these sites ( @xmath35 ) and at the same time the empty site moves from site @xmath9 to @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "it has been shown that mean field description can be obtained by assuming average values @xmath37 and @xmath38 at each site . two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 entering the mean field hamiltonian can be choosen so as to make minimal the ground state energy @xmath41 .",
    "one gets @xcite @xmath42 here @xmath43 denotes the concentration of electrons in the band ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "there are two modifications of the spectrum of electrons encountered on the mean field level .",
    "first is the band narrowing described by @xmath44 an its shift described by @xmath40 .",

    "this important fact has first been noted by zieli / nski and coworkers @xcite and leads , as we shall see , to severe changes in the form of eliashberg equations .    to derive them we use the equation of motion method for the double time thermodynamic green s functions . for arbitrary operators @xmath63 an @xmath64 it reads ( we employ here the zubariev notation @xcite ) @xmath65_\\pm \\rangle +      \\ll[a , h]_- \\vert b\\gg_\\omega \\\\ & = & \\langle[a , b]_\\pm\\rangle - \\ll a\\vert[b , h]_-\\gg_\\omega\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the fourier transformed , frequency dependent , retarded green s function .",

    "there are also two contributions from three particle scattering events : fermion  phonon  slave boson . from @xmath56",
    "part of the hamiltonian we get @xmath77 while from second term in @xmath57 @xmath78 to get real frequency axis eliashberg equations in a  standard form @xcite one has to express the higher order green s function appearing on the rhs of various selfenergy pieces by the gf s of fermions @xmath79 , bosons @xmath80 and , , phonons  @xmath81 .",
    "this is easily achieved with help of spectral representation and decoupling of various time correlation functions as e.g. @xmath82 this approximation neglets vertex corrections . in the present situations",
    "the vertex corrections stem from fermion  phonon , fermion  boson and also more complicated interactions . as already mentioned the assumption of small electron ",
    "phonon coupling allows us to neglect fermion  phonon vertex corrections .",

    "they do not contain small parameters and should be taken into account .",

    "it is both shifted and mass renormalised to @xmath129 . beyond mean field level for bosons",
    "the nontrivial energy dependence comes from renormalisation of the fermion ( matrix ) greens function given by the @xmath130 factor .",
    "note , that from the equation for @xmath130 and definition ( 20 ) of @xmath131 we have @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are weakly @xmath135 dependent functions to be calculated from equation ( 17 ) . to take this effect into account one has to solve the equations at each point of the brillouin zone  a very difficult task .",

    "the relevant parameters describing superconducting transition temperature @xmath142 are the typical phonon frequency @xmath143 and electron  phonon parameter @xmath144 .",
    "the last parameter is determined by the kernel @xmath145 . in our theory",
    "we do have two different kernels as also found previously by zieli / nski and coworkers @xcite @xcite .",
    "we thus define two coupling constants @xmath144 and @xmath146 .",
    "the first one is related to wave function renormalisation and other describes genuine superconducting coupling in strongly correlated system .",
    "we define @xmath147 by @xcite @xmath148 where @xmath149 similar expression defines @xmath146 except that @xmath150 enters . in the general case there exist four more parameters : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",

    "the covalent part of the interaction is strongly @xmath135 dependent .",
    "it is described by the matrix element @xmath172 in equation ( 15 ) . in figure ( 1a )",
    "we show the results obtained by making the same approximation as in previous treatment of the similar model,@xcite where @xmath173 has been replaced by wave vector independent constant multiplied by @xmath174 .",
    "the concentration dependence of _ s , p _ and @xmath175 components of the coupling constant are shown by solid , dotted and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "it is the factor @xmath176 , which strongly supresses the values of @xmath177 at higher electron concentrations .",
    "the important point is that for small doping of holes the d - wave component is the largest one .",
    "this signals the possibility of the d - wave pairing in this parameter range . for @xmath178",
    "the p - wave pairing takes over . at quite small electron concentrations extended",
    "s - wave seem to be most stable pairing .    in figure ( 1b )",
    "we show similar set of data obtained with @xmath179 replaced by its fermi surface average @xmath180 . due to oscilatory dependence of @xmath181 on wave vectors",
    "the average value of it is strongly concentration dependent ( solid line in figure ( 1b ) ) and reduced in comparison to 1 ( the value arbitrarily assumed for data shown in fig.(1a ) ) .",
    "small values of @xmath182 at large @xmath164 are due again to @xmath174 factor , while at small @xmath164 to phase space restrictions .",
    "taking the full wave vector dependence of @xmath183 leads to the results shown in figure ( 1c ) .",
    "solid line in this figure shows total coupling @xmath184 calculated from ( 26 ) .",
    "other lines represent the symmetry components @xmath177 as indicated .",
    "the values of all couplings are very small .",
    "thus in the mean field approximation for slave bosons one is not able to get realistic values of the superconducting transition temperature from covalent part of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "let us look at the relative values of the various couplings . at large electron concentration ( small hole dopping ) the d- wave component of @xmath185 exceeds by far all other components .",
    "bigger values of coupling constants are obtained when ionic part of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction is taken into account .",
    "figure ( 2a ) shows the concentration dependence of @xmath185 ( solid line ) and @xmath177 ( dashed lines ) obtained for @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( in units of @xmath188 ) .",
    "the values of the coupling parameters are quite realistic now .",
    "the nice feature of this result is the possibility of d symmetry pairing at small hole concentration .",
    "the presence of both ionic and covalent parts of electron - phonon interaction leads to small changes of the phase diagram ( cf .",
    "fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "the d symmetry remains most probable at small hole dopings @xmath189 . for intermediate carrier concentrations p - wave pairing",
    "is most stable , while extended s - wave is stable at small electron concentration @xmath190 .",
    "the slight decrease of the values of couplings as compared to figure ( 2a ) is due to interference effects between interaction channels ( cf .",
    "expression ( 15 ) for @xmath172 ) . in this work",
    "we have concentrated on the calculation of the electron  phonon coupling constants . to obtain realistic estimations of the concentration dependence of the superconducting transition temperature one has to take simultaneously into account the condensation of the ( slave ) bosons .",
    "boson condensation temperature @xmath191 of the 3d massive bosons is proportional to the @xmath192 power of the boson concentration @xmath193 .",
    "for the masless bosons the power changes to @xmath194 in 3d case and @xmath195 for interesting case of two dimensional system . becouse superconducting transition temperature , in the systems with covalent coupling ( c.f .",
    "figures 1a,1b,1c ) , also vanishes for @xmath196 , the additional condition for bose ",
    "einstein condensation can change the phase diagram in quantitative way only .",
    "the situation is different in systems with ionic or mixed ( covalent plus ionic ) interactions and especially for the phase with @xmath175wave symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath197 takes on sizeable values ( c.f . figs .",
    "2a and 2b ) at low hole concentration .",
    "in this case the additional condition will modify the @xmath198 phase diagram making it qualitatively more similar to that obtained for covalent electron  phonon interaction . in conclusion",
