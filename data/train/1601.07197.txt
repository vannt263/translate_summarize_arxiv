    "understanding nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum systems interacting with a large number of uncontrollable degrees of freedom is a rapidly emerging topic , developed in various fields , such as quantum optics and quantum computation based on mesoscopic solid system  @xcite . in spin - based systems ,",
    "quantum computing proposals using quantum dots  @xcite have led to intensive studies on coherent control of quantum degrees of freedom , in particular electron spins .",
    "electron spin qubits in nuclear spin environments have two distinct merits : scalability and non - markovianity , where the latter will be the focus of this study .",
    "the motion of electron spin in the nano - scale structures , where the quantum effects are important , is therefore crucial in fundamental research of open quantum systems  @xcite and quantum control techniques or strategies  @xcite .    for solid spin - qubit systems , a variety of mechanisms",
    "have been identified to be responsible for the electron spin decoherence , such as the spin - orbital scattering with phonons , spectral diffusion due to dipolar interaction of nuclear spins , and the hyperfine interaction between electron spin and environmental nuclear spins .",
    "low temperature and high magnetic field have been used to successfully reduce decoherence due to these mechanisms but fail to suppress that due to hyperfine interaction . under the hyperfine interaction ,",
    "the nuclear spin bath is highly non - markovian and the central spin has a long coherence time  @xcite . to understand these interesting observations an _ exact _ master equation for the central electron spin , as that for the spin - bath model  @xcite , is therefore desired",
    ".    the paper first derives an exact master equation for the central spin under the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this equation enables us to study dynamics of the central spin , and more interestingly to demonstrate the controlled dynamics by the nonperturbative leakage elimination operator ( leo ) protocol .",
    "the nonperturbative leo protocol was introduced recently  @xcite to suppress decoherence due to the presence of environment interference .",
    "the advantage of the protocol is that we can introduce a leo to the system hamiltonian , keeping the open system dynamics exactly solvable irrespective to the size of the system .",
    "because of the exact solvability , we could understand correctly controllability of non - markovianity and clarify possible confusion owing to the markovian approximation .",
    "consider a central spin-@xmath0 embedded in a spin-@xmath0 bath through the hyperfine interaction : @xmath1 where the first two terms correspond to the zeeman energy of the central and environmental spins , the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicate the central spin and environmental spin modes , respectively , and @xmath4 s are the coupling strengths between the central spin and the @xmath5-th environmental spin .",
    "this is a typical spin - bath model characterizing physical entities such as atomic , molecular systems and artificial two - level systems .    in quantum dot systems , @xmath6 is determined by the electron spin zeeman effect of external magnetic field .",
    "the third and the fourth term of eq .",
    "( [ sh ] ) are termed as the flip - flop interaction and ( longitudinal ) overhauser field , giving rise to inhomogeneous broadening and dephasing respectively . in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath7 ,",
    "the total hamiltonian becomes @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "note that the last term in eq .",
    "( [ shi ] ) is equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "the total exciton number or angular momentum is conserved under the total hamiltonian , such that one can work in one of invariant subspaces at a given exciton number .",
    "it is interesting to note that , the transversal hyperfine term @xmath13 results in off - resonant transitions between the system spin and environmental spins , while the longitudinal hyperfine term @xmath14 provides additional contributions to the energy splitting .",
    "in general an initial state @xmath15 evolves into the state @xmath16 at time @xmath17 according to the schrdinger equation represented in the single - exciton subspace , @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "we now assume a fully polarized initial spin - bath state , @xmath20 , as done in ref .",
    "@xcite and evidenced by recent high polarization experiments in quantum hall edge states  @xcite ( @xmath21 ) and a bias voltage in a ballistic quantum wire  @xcite ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 therefore satisfies @xmath24 where the kernel function is given by a two - point correlation function of the reservoir @xmath25 , and the first term in eq .",
    "( [ c0 ] ) is given by the overhauser field in the total hamiltonian  ( [ sh ] ) .",
    "we now define a propagator that @xmath26 , which does not depend on the initial condition due to the convex - linear characteristic in the decomposition of system initial state .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath27 and can show that it satisfies @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to construct an exact master equation for the central spin in a time - convolutionless ( tcl ) form : @xmath31",
    ", one can use an exact dynamical map @xmath32 , which transforms the initial states into the states at time @xmath17 : @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 . after a straightforward derivation",
    ", we can obtain the exact tcl master equation @xmath35 \\\\ \\label{zero } & + & { \\gamma}(t)\\left[{\\sigma}_-\\rho(t){\\sigma}_+-\\frac{1}{2}\\{{\\sigma}_+{\\sigma}_- , \\rho(t)\\}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "thus the stark - shift effect and the damping rate are determined by the imaginary and real parts of @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "it is evident that @xmath39 , such that the damping rate is fully determined by eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) .",
    "the fidelity @xmath40 is @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "the dynamics of the exact tcl equation , parameterized by @xmath43 and @xmath44 , is given by the correlation functions @xmath45 determined by various environments .",
    "now we first consider an exponential correlation function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is usually understood as a measure of memory capacity or non - markovianity of the environment .",
    "when @xmath47 approaches zero , the correlation function and @xmath42 become constants such that the corresponding environment memorizes the whole information between any two time moments @xmath17 and @xmath48 .",
    "contrarily , when it approaches infinity , the correlation function between any two time moments @xmath17 and @xmath48 becomes a delta function , such that the environment loses its capacity of memory .",
    "the solution of @xmath49 is @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in this special case .",
    "the coefficient @xmath53 and the decay rate in the tcl equation  ( [ zero ] ) is @xmath54 an interesting example is that when @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this means that the probability for the central electron spin staying at the upper level @xmath58 decays in the manner of @xmath59 in the short time limit , which is dramatically different from the normal exponential decay behavior for a two - level system embedded in a dissipative bosonic bath .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath60 decay is similar to the anti - zeno effect shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .     in eq .",
    "( [ tgt ] ) as a function of dimensionless time @xmath61 and environmental memory parameter @xmath62 .",
    ", width=288 ]    figure  ( [ ffree ] ) shows dynamics of the fidelity @xmath63 .",
    "the correlation function is a lorentzian spectral density , and its half - width is @xmath47 . since realistic spin - bath spectra",
    "are distributed over a relatively narrow frequency regime , the lorentzian function is not an accurate characterization but an approximation .",
    "therefore the spectra must be truncated based on physical consideration , and in our case the truncation is set as @xmath64 , as shown in the figure  [ ffree ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath62 is below @xmath65 , the fidelity revives , and information bounces from the spin bath back to the system .",
    "this is a typical non - markovian dynamics .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is that although in the short time limit , the decay speed of fidelity increases with @xmath47 , whereas the moment when the system - spin completely decays is independent of a monotonic relation with the memory parameter .",
    "it is evident that when @xmath66 , the fidelity vanishes at a time which decreases with @xmath47 .",
    "moreover the fidelity reaches its maximum around @xmath67 , and then declines asymptotically to a steady value when @xmath68 .",
    "we now consider the case when @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the number of environmental spins . for this model , we have @xmath72 , and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 .",
    "inserting it into eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) , one can find the solution @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the system will periodically come back to its initial state when the absolute value of @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath78 with @xmath79 arbitrary integer .",
    "this `` box '' model describes that the central spin coherence can be reversibly transferred into a collective state of the surrounding environmental spins , and allows for exploiting the environmental spins to store quantum information in the central spin .",
    "the leading decoherence mechanism for the stored state is bath - spin diffusion , with dephasing rates in the khz domain .",
    "techniques similar to spin - echo  @xcite can be used to mitigate its effect .",
    "solid ( semiconductor ) spin - based qubits are promising candidates for quantum computation because of their scalability .",
    "the fundamental single - qubit gates have been demonstrated for gaas - based spin qubits  @xcite .",
    "the typical data of the iii - v semiconductor compounds for quantum dot  @xcite shows that @xmath80 , implying that the `` box '' model is a reasonable idealization .",
    "the inherent error caused by the hyperfine coupling therefore features with a non - markovian character and then can be controlled to some extent .",
    "the overhauser effect is determined by signs of @xmath4 or @xmath81 relative to @xmath6 .",
    "if their signs are the same , @xmath82 will be reduced .",
    "this is equivalent to reduce the energy splitting of the central spin and makes it more fragile to the decoherence induced by flip - flop term .",
    "otherwise , the overhauser field could naturally protect the system coherence .",
    "let us now consider a more realistic situation where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are @xmath5-dependent , i.e. , @xmath84 , and then @xmath85 .",
    "as discussed in the `` box '' model , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath4 satisfy a gaussian distribution characterized by the mean value @xmath86 and the variance @xmath87 , where @xmath86 and @xmath88 are in the same order of @xmath89 . since in reality @xmath6 and @xmath90",
    "are much larger than @xmath91 , @xmath92 can be approximated to a continuous variable centering the average value @xmath90 .",
    "therefore when @xmath93 , the effective correlation function of the spin - bath can be written as @xmath94 which is insensitive to the mean frequency of the bath - spins since most of @xmath4 s are much less than @xmath90 and @xmath95 .",
    "similarly , @xmath45 and @xmath96 , which can be numerically obtained by inserting eq .",
    "( [ fts ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) , are also insensitive to @xmath88 because @xmath97 .     as a function of the dimensionless time @xmath98 , where @xmath86 is the average frequency of @xmath91 , and @xmath71 is the number of bath - spins.,width=288 ]    figure .",
    "( [ ffree2 ] ) demonstrate @xmath63 as a function of the number of environmental spins @xmath71 , we set @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "it is interesting to compare the decoherence patterns for different @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath101 , the fidelity decays with a strong fluctuation , meaning that exchange of the quantum information and energy between the system and bath spins is significant .",
    "when @xmath71 increases , the amplitude of fluctuation shrinks and the decay rate becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "as such the coherence of the central spin remains robust for large @xmath71 .",
    "we can apply an open - loop control technique using leakage elimination operator to strengthen the robustness of the central spin system  @xcite .",
    "specifically , leo for this system is @xmath102 and the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a time - dependent function .",
    "a distinguished character for @xmath105 is , as shown in the pervious and present studies , that @xmath104 can be almost arbitrarily chosen , even chaotic or noisy signals .     as a function of dimensionless time @xmath61 with different environmental memory parameter @xmath47 . in the control of leo protocol",
    ", we apply a random pulse sequence , whose period and duration time are @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , and the average strength is @xmath108.,width=288 ]    by using the fast bang - bang pulses circuit and @xmath109 and @xmath110 $ ] , it follows that @xmath111 , where we apply the trotter formula that the evolution operator @xmath112 .",
    "this result holds to the order of @xmath60 only and is an idealization or perturbation . in the nonperturbative case , the presence of @xmath113 in the total hamiltonian will modify the kernel @xmath45 into @xmath114 where @xmath115 . according to the riemann - lebesgue lemma , if @xmath116 is finite , which is evident , then the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gt ] ) approaches zero as @xmath117 .",
    "therefore when @xmath118 is sufficient large , one can use leo to suppress the decoherence of the system spin .",
    "consequently , the effectiveness of leos depends solely on the integral @xmath119 in the time domain but not the details of @xmath104 .",
    "figure  ( [ fcont ] ) demonstrates the free and controlled dynamics of @xmath63 . in the leo control protocol",
    ", we use an equiv - distant rectangular pulse sequence , whose intensity is random described by @xmath120 in the duration time @xmath121 and is zero in the dark time for each period @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is a random number between zero and one and @xmath124 is the average strength .",
    "the figure shows that leo control is excellent when it is applied in a strong non - markovian regime with a longer memory time characterized by @xmath125 .",
    "therefore leo is a reliable tool to decouple the system spin from the influence of spin bath .",
    "our formalism clarifies a fact that _ an ideal markovian process can not be controlled _ because in the markovian limit where @xmath126 , the control factor @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) becomes invalid . in other words ,",
    "a markovian dynamics can not be affected by external controlled fields .",
    "we have proposed an exact master equation for a central spin coupled to a spin bath .",
    "we analyze its decoherence dynamics in the presence of a lorenzian and a gaussian spectral density functions , respectively .",
    "we have found that the overhauser field may help to suppress the decoherence process of the system spin , and the system evolution may be periodic in the `` box '' approximation .",
    "leakage elimination operator is applied to the system , and we show that the operator can protect coherence of the central spin . although our master equation is obtained based on the full polarization assumption , yet it still provides a convenient way to capture the non - markovian feature of the spin bath .",
    "the control technology hinted by the master equation can be used in spin - based quantum setups , in which the non - markovianity ( the long - time memory capability ) is beneficial to maintain coherence of the central spin system .",
