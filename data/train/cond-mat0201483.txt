    "the calculation of excitation energies and linewidths of collective excitations in extended electronic systems is one of the outstanding problems in many - body theory .",
    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tdft ) @xcite offers a powerful and elegant approach to this difficult problem . to set the stage for the developments that are to follow",
    ", we shall begin this paper with a summary of the key elements of tdft .",
    "let @xmath2 be the hamiltonian of a many - electron system , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the canonical coordinates and momenta of the @xmath5th electron , @xmath6 is its mass , @xmath7 is a static external potential , which includes contributions from randomly distributed impurities and other sources of disorder , and @xmath8 is the coulomb interaction potential . to calculate the excitation energies,@xcite",
    "one adds to @xmath9 a small time - dependent perturbation of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a periodic potential ( @xmath12 ) that couples linearly to the density operator @xmath13 .",
    "one then computes the time - dependent density of the system , which , in the linear approximation , will be given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ground - state density , and @xmath16 is linearly related to @xmath17 via @xmath18 the _ density - density response function _",
    "@xmath19 contains the essential information about those excited states of the system that are coupled to the ground state by the perturbation @xmath20 .",
    "more specifically , in a finite system ( atom or molecule ) this response function has a discrete set of poles on the real frequency axis , corresponding to the discrete excitation energies of the system . in an extended system ,",
    "the poles merge into a continuous branch cut along the real axis . however , isolated poles can arise in the lower half of the complex frequency plane : they correspond to collective excitations of the system , where the imaginary part of the frequency defines the characteristic lifetime of the excitation .",
    "the basic tdft strategy for calculating @xmath21 is to construct a _ noninteracting _ system that has the same ground - state density @xmath15 , and yields the same density response @xmath16 as the interacting system under study .",
    "the dynamics of this noninteracting system is controlled by an effective single - particle potential which is written as the sum of the total external potential @xmath22 plus the hartree potential @xmath23 plus a remainder , which is known as the `` exchange - correlation '' ( xc ) potential @xmath24 .",
    "it is not at all obvious that such a potential @xmath25 can be constructed , but , if it can , then runge and gross@xcite showed that it is a _",
    "unique functional _ of the time - dependent density up to within an additive function of time .",
    "the form of the xc potential depends , in general , on the initial state of the system , but this dependence disappears if one assumes , as we do here , that the system is initially in its ground state .",
    "@xcite the effective noninteracting hamiltonian ( also known as the kohn - sham hamiltonian ) that yields the exact density is then given by @xmath26 \\hat n({\\bf r } ) \\ ; ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both the hartree and the xc potential have been written as the sum of static parts @xmath27 associated with the ground - state density , and ( small ) time - dependent parts @xmath28 associated with the time - dependent density . the static part of the kohn - sham hamiltonian [ first line of eq .",
    "( [ hks ] ) ] yields the exact ground - state density in the interacting system , while the time - dependent part [ the second line of eq .",
    "( [ hks ] ) ] yields the exact density response .    in the linear response regime",
    "the xc potential can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 depends only on the ground - state density , and @xmath31 is the retarded xc kernel , formally defined as @xmath32({\\bf r},t ) } { \\delta n({\\bf r},t ' ) } \\right|_{n_0({\\bf r } ) } .\\ ] ] fourier transformation of both @xmath25 and @xmath33 with respect to time leads to the simpler relation @xmath34 we denote by @xmath35 the density - density response function of the _ static _ kohn - sham system [ the first line of eq .",
    "( [ hks ] ) ] .",
    "the second line of the same equation can then be regarded as a time - dependent perturbation to the first .",
    "the time - dependent density response is therefore given by    @xmath36 n_1({\\bf r}'',\\omega ) \\right \\},\\ ] ]    where the second and the third terms in the curly brackets arise from @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "comparing eqs .",
    "( [ chi ] ) and ( [ n1bis ] ) we obtain the following integral relation between the exact density - density response function @xmath21 and the noninteracting response function @xmath35 : @xmath39\\chi({\\bf y},{\\bf r}',\\omega ) \\;.\\ ] ]    this can also be written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the matrix inverse of @xmath42 .",
    "the excitation energies are finally obtained from the poles of the linear response function , i.e. , from the solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the function that describes the spatial dependence of the density in the excited state .",
    "( [ chiintegralequation ] ) is the main formal result in the tdft approach to the calculation of excitation energies . from a fundamental point of view , calculating @xmath33 is of course no easier than calculating @xmath42 .",
    "the main advantage of recasting linear response theory within tdft is of a more practical nature : as long as the exact excitations of the interacting system are in qualitative correspondence to those of the kohn - sham system ( a kind of `` fermi liquid '' assumption ) , the xc kernel in eq .",
    "( [ chiintegralequation ] ) is expected to be a small correction , which can be approximated with relative impunity .",
    "@xcite the simplest approximation is to ignore both nonlocality in space and retardation in time .",
    "this leads to the widely used _",
    "adiabatic local density approximation _",
    "( alda)@xcite in which one poses @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the xc energy density@xcite of the homogeneous electron gas of density @xmath47 . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ alda ] ) is nothing but the local density approximation for the _ ground - state _ xc potential evaluated at the time - dependent density . in terms of the xc kernel , this approximation implies @xmath48 which is a purely real and frequency - independent object .    the alda is a remarkably successful approximation , despite the fact that it entirely neglects the frequency dependence of the xc kernel , that is , the _ retarded _ dependence of the xc potential on the density at earlier times . in atoms",
    "the alda has yielded reasonably accurate values of the excitation energies .",
    "@xcite most of the residual inaccuracy has been traced to the fact that the ground - state xc potential in the lda fails at large distance from the nucleus .",
    "an optimized effective potential approach,@xcite similar in spirit to eq .",
    "( [ alda ] ) , but still without retardation , yields a dramatic improvement in accuracy.@xcite applications to more complex systems ( molecules , polymers)@xcite have met with similar degree of success .",
    "the essential reason seems to be that the frequency dependence of the xc kernel is rather weak , because it is controlled by multi - electron excitations , which are either very high in energy ( atoms and molecules ) , or smoothly distributed through a spectral range ( extended systems ) .",
    "there are , however , some important features of the dynamical response that can not be accounted for in any way by an instantaneous xc potential .",
    "quite generally , the need for a dynamical theory of @xmath33 arises in the study of excitations that do not have an analogue in the kohn - sham system .",
    "perhaps the clearest example of this is provided by collective excitations in extended electronic systems , such as bulk- and surface plasmons in metals or inter- and intrasubband plasmons in doped semiconductor quantum wells . in this case , the alda would predict resonance peaks of vanishing width , in glaring contradiction to experiment .    attempts to go beyond the alda to include retardation date back to the mid - eighties . in 1985",
    "gross and kohn@xcite proposed a dynamical local density approximation for @xmath33 which was designed to preserve the local relationship between @xmath38 and the density , while including retardation in time .",
    "their approximation reads @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the xc kernel of the uniform electron gas calculated at the local ground - state density @xmath15 ( more about @xmath51 will be said in the next sections ) .",
    "because @xmath52 is complex , this approximation yields a finite linewidth for excitations that would have zero linewidth in the alda .",
    "@xcite    unfortunately , the gross - kohn approximation ( [ gk ] ) suffers from several inconsistencies , such as the failure to satisfy the generalized kohn s theorem @xcite and related sum rules.@xcite as a consequence , it was found @xcite that within this approximation , intersubband plasmons in quantum wells may become substantially overdamped .",
    "these deficiencies were ultimately traced back to the fact that a local approximation for the dynamical xc potential in terms of the density does not exist ( except at @xmath53 , in which case it is the static lda ) .",
    "the reason for this startling result is that the xc kernel of a non - homogeneous system is a function of infinite range in space , or , more precisely , the spatial fourier transform @xmath54 diverges when @xmath55 at constant @xmath56 or vice versa .",
    "( in the homogeneous case one has @xmath57 and the singularity disappears ) .",
    "vignale and kohn ( vk ) @xcite and vignale , ullrich and conti ( vuc ) @xcite showed that the nonlocality problem could be circumvented by working with the _ current density _ rather than the density as a basic variable .",
    "the idea is to perturb the system ( [ h0 ] ) with a time - dependent _ vector potential _ @xmath58 rather than with a scalar potential .",
    "the perturbing hamiltonian has the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] is the _",
    "paramagnetic _ current density operator .",
    "@xcite one then calculates the current response , and determines the excitation energies from the poles of the _ current - current response function_.    the kohn - sham hamiltonian in this time - dependent current density functional theory ( tcdft ) contains an xc vector potential @xmath61 , which is a ( linear ) functional of the full current density response @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the tensorial generalization of the usual xc kernel ( here and in the following , @xmath65 denote cartesian components ) .",
    "the static part of the kohn - sham hamiltonian remains unchanged , and the ground - state density is still determined by the static xc field @xmath66 .",
    "it turns out that the xc vector potential _ does _ admit a local approximation in terms of the current density : as we shall see in the next section , the form of this approximation is essentially determined by symmetry considerations and can be expressed in terms of an xc stress tensor.@xcite the resulting expression for @xmath67 is local in space , retarded in time , satisfies the generalized kohn s theorem,@xcite and allows a consistent calculation of the linewidth of elementary excitations , at least the part of it that arises from intrinsic many - body effects .",
    "the fundamental reason why all this is possible is that the relationship between the longitudinal current and the density is nonlocal . from the continuity equation",
    "@xmath68 one sees that the longitudinal component of the current is given by @xmath69 while the transverse component of the current remains undetermined .",
    "thus , a local functional of @xmath70 will necessarily be a nonlocal functional of the density .",
    "what is remarkable here is that the nonlocality of @xmath38 as a functional of density can be completely eliminated by `` upgrading '' tdft to a description in terms of @xmath67 and @xmath71 .",
    "this is the essence of the vk and vuc theory .    since any scalar potential",
    "can be represented by an equivalent vector potential , and since the density is easily calculated from the current [ see eq .",
    "( [ continuity ] ) ] , we see that the ordinary tdft is a special case of the tcdft formulation .",
    "@xcite an additional advantage of this formulation is that it allows one to treat the more general problem of the response of an electronic system to an electromagnetic field having both longitudinal and transverse components , whereas the original runge - gross formulation is limited to longitudinal fields , i.e. , fields that can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "although the vk and vuc formulations are important steps enabling the calculation of the linewidth of elementary excitations in extended systems , they are still not sufficient to achieve quantitative accuracy in cases of practical interest . for example , the calculation of the linewidth of the intersubband ( isb ) plasmon in a 40-nm gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum well reported in ref .",
    ", based on vuc formalism , yielded a linewidth about 5 times smaller than the experimental value .",
    "the reason for this disappointing result is that the theory , as it stands , does not take into account other intrinsic and extrinsic sources of damping , such as electron - phonon interactions , electron - impurity scattering , and , in the case of quantum wells , interfacial roughness .",
    "all these interactions contribute to the linewidth and must be included in any calculation that aspires to quantitative accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we take a first step in this direction by showing how two of the most prominent contributions to the low - temperature linewidth of plasmons in quantum wells , namely electron - impurity scattering and interfacial roughness , can be built into the current - density functional formalism .",
    "our approach is based on a the `` marriage '' of the tcdft formalism with the memory function formalism described , for example , by forster.@xcite in the homogeneous electron gas limit this approach reduces to the belitz - das sarma @xcite treatment of the effect of impurities on bulk plasmons , which , in turn , can be viewed as the high - frequency extension of the mermin relaxation - time approximation @xcite for the density - density response function of an electron gas in the presence of randomly distributed impurities .",
    "of course , our interest lies in strongly inhomogeneous systems , such as quantum wells , @xcite which exhibit the _ intersubband _ plasmon resonance .",
    "such resonances are of practical interest in connection with the design of infrared detector devices .",
    "our strategy is to derive an integral equation which relates the current response function of the disordered interacting many - electron system to that of the same system in the absence of disorder : the latter is calculated by the standard tcdft outlined above .",
    "we shall show that this approach ( despite some inevitable approximations in the treatment of disorder ) meets with considerable success : the linewidth of the intersubband plasmon is considerably enhanced by disorder  in particular , by interfacial roughness  and agrees quantitatively with the measured one .",
    "more importantly , the qualitative behavior of the linewidth as a function of an external electric field that controls the shape of the quantum well is correctly reproduced .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ secii ] we review the main aspects of the tcdft formalism for the linear response of many - electron systems . in section [ seciii ]",
    "we review the memory function formalism and demonstrate its application to the case of a homogeneous electron gas with randomly distributed impurities .",
    "these sections are meant to make the paper self - contained and to provide the necessary background for the following more technical parts . in section [ seciv ]",
    "we combine the memory function formalism with tcdft for inhomogeneous systems and derive the key integral equations for the current - current response functions .",
    "finally , in section [ secv ] we demonstrate the power of the method by calculating the linewidth of the intersubband plasmon in a quantum well and comparing to recent experimental results , and in section [ secvi ] we give our conclusions .",
    "for orientation , let us first consider the xc kernels of a _ homogeneous _ electron gas . because of translational invariance , it is convenient to work with the fourier transform @xmath72 of the current density .",
    "the linear response of this quantity to a vector potential @xmath73 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the current - current response tensor . due to rotational invariance ,",
    "the responses of the longitudinal ( parallel to @xmath76 ) and transverse ( perpendicular to @xmath76 ) components of the current are completely independent , and one can write @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the longitudinal ( transverse ) component , and @xmath79 is the longitudinal ( transverse ) response function . according to the general linear response formalism,@xcite @xmath80",

( [ currentresponse3 ] )",
    "is that in the limit of @xmath55 and finite @xmath90 it has the limiting form @xmath91 where @xmath92 are functions of frequency only , @xmath93 is the homogeneous dielectric function , and @xmath94 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction .",
    "notice that the difference between the longitudinal and transverse results at @xmath95 is due to the long range of the coulomb interaction : the difference vanishes if @xmath94 diverges more slowly than @xmath96 .",
    "translational invariance is the essential reason for the small-@xmath97 behavior of the @xmath42 s . in the @xmath55",
    "limit the current operator reduces to the total momentum operator plus a correction that vanishes linearly with @xmath97 .",
    "thus the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ chismallk ] ) is the response of the center - of - mass momentum , which obeys a simple equation of motion under the action of the external force , while the second term , of order @xmath98 , comes from the residual part of the operator , which is linear in @xmath97 .",
    "there are no cross terms , since the dynamics of the center of mass is decoupled from that of the internal degrees of freedom .",

    "the fact that the shear modulus does not vanish for @xmath140 but tends to the finite value of eq .",
    "( [ zerolimit ] ) is perhaps surprising .",

    "the reason for this strange behavior is that we are taking the @xmath55 limit _ before _ the @xmath140 limit .",

    "the truly static shear modulus is zero , as expected .",

    "the answer is that this and similar ambiguities are completely removed by general physical requirements which we now discuss .",
    "first of all , because the coulomb interaction obeys newton s third law , the net force exerted by the xc electric field on the system must vanish . at the local level , newton s",
    "third law implies that a small volume of the electron liquid can not exert a net force on itself .",
    "accordingly , the net force acting on an arbitrary volume element must be expressible as the integral of the _ external _ stresses exerted by the surrounding fluid on the surface of the volume element .",
    "the mathematical expression of this requirement is that the force density must be the divergence of a local stress tensor as in eq .",
    "( [ exc5 ] ) .    a similar argument",

    "this saturation can be understood as a negative feedback effect , related to the self - consistency of the memory functions ( [ memoryfunction_i ] ) and ( [ memoryfunction_r ] ) .",

    "in this paper , we have dealt with a long - standing problem in the many - body theory of extended systems : the calculation of collective electronic excitations and their associated linewidths in systems that are both inhomogeneous and weakly disordered , in the sense that the random potential can be treated as a perturbation . in any real extended system , collective excitations are subject to dissipation , causing the associated coherent , plasmon - like motion to decay into many individual , incoherent degrees of freedom associated with single - particle excitations .",
    "it has been common practice in the literature to describe these processes with phenomenological assumptions of varying degrees of refinement .",
    "this paper , by contrast , presents a new formalism that allows one to calculate excitation energies and their lifetimes entirely from first principles .",
    "our approach begins with the basic notion that there are two classes of mechanisms that are responsible for dissipation of collective electronic dynamics .",
    "the first class is _ intrinsic _ scattering , which occurs even in a `` perfect '' material or device .",
    "here we have in mind primarily systems where phonon scattering is inactive , so the only source of intrinsic dissipation are electronic many - body effects such as multiple particle - hole excitations .",
    "the second class of dissipation mechanisms is _ extrinsic _ in nature , such as scattering off impurities and disorder .",
    "our treatment of intrinsic scattering relies on tdft for the linear response .",
    "fundamental existence theorems guarantee that tdft describes the linear dynamics of interacting many - electron systems in principle exactly , including dissipation of collective degrees of freedom . in practice , however , the success of a tdft approach relies on the approximations used for the linearized xc potential .",
    "the most widely used approximation , the alda , has proved to be useful for calculating accurate excitation energies , but it produces linewidths that are strictly zero . thus , a non - adiabatic description , which includes retardation , is required . a non - adiabatic dynamical density - functional approach which is local in space but nonlocal in time has to be formulated replacing the density with the current as basic variable ( tcdft ) . as a result , the linearized xc potential in the tcdft response equation in general acquires a frequency dependence and an imaginary part , leading to finite linewidths .    to deal with extrinsic scattering ,",
    "on the other hand , we make use of a powerful formal technique , the so - called memory function formalism . this approach can be traced back to the relaxation time approximation , but it replaces the simple phenomenological relaxation time @xmath304 with the memory function @xmath332 , which is defined microscopically as a correlation function between fluctuating random forces .",
    "the memory function formalism is developed in the language of kubo relaxation functions , which are , however , intimately connected to the ( current)density response functions .",
    "the final step then consists in uniting the memory function formalism with linear response theory in tcdft .",
    "we thus arrive at a new , self - consistent theory that expresses the response function of an interacting system in the presence of _ both _ intrinsic and extrinsic damping in terms of the `` clean '' interacting response function ( which contains only intrinsic damping ) and the memory function ( which accounts only for extrinsic damping ) .",
    "we finally applied the theory to describe isb plasmons in a wide gaas / al@xmath0ga@xmath1as quantum well . using reasonable values for the roughness parameters",
    ", we obtained quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured linewidth .",
    "but we also found that purely electronic damping due to dynamical exchange and correlations makes non - negligible contributions to the linewidth , especially for high electronic densities , where the effect can be as high as a few tens of percents .",
    "a further remarkable outcome of this study is the physical insight that the isb plasmon linewidth is primarily controlled by interfacial roughness , and only weakly affected by the concentration of bulk impurities .",
    "the opposite is true for the in - plane mobility , which is primarily controlled by bulk impurities.@xcite thus , the correlation between isb plasmon linewidth and in - plane mobility is rather weak , which is physically understandable since currents are flowing perpendicular to the quantum well in the former case , and parallel to it in the latter .                    strictly speaking , the runge - gross proof does not apply to adiabatically switched - on periodic potentials such as the ones employed in linear response theory .",
    "there are known examples @xcite of two different periodic potentials producing the same linear response in a finite system . however , such pathologies are expected to disappear @xcite in extended systems , such as the ones considered in this paper .",
    "we take the point of view that the _",
    "static _ xc potential can be adequately treated in one of the existing approximations , e.g. , the static lda .",
    "the kohn - sham response function can then be constructed in the standard way from the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the static kohn - sham problem .",
