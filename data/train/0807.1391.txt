    "( [ susceptibility ] ) ] .",
    "our rgm data confirm these findings ( see also ref .  ) .",

    "[ chi_t2 ] and [ xi_t ] ) .",
    "a linear fit of the rgm data points yields the relations @xmath145 which describe the rgm data in high precision .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath10 and of @xmath11 at @xmath144 reflects the zero - temperature phase transition at this point and indicates the change in the low - temperature behavior of the physical quantities at the critical point . using the same @xmath5 data points as in the insets of figs .",

    "[ specwaermecomp ] our rgm and ed results for @xmath3 are compared with the tmrg data.@xcite obviously , the ed results are in a very good agreement with the tmrg data .",

    "the specific heat shows another interesting low - temperature feature ( see fig .",
    "[ specheat ] ) . in the region",
    "@xmath155 with a ferromagnetic gs , the specific heat exhibits two maxima . besides the broad maximum at @xmath156 , an additional frustration - induced low - temperature maximum appears , which is found by the ed and rgm methods for @xmath157 and @xmath158 , respectively .",
    "as shown by a detailed analysis ( see also below ) , the behavior of @xmath3 at very low temperature is appreciably affected by finite - size effects .",
    "in particular , in the ed data , the low - temperature maximum is superimposed by a quite sharp extra finite - size peak , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ specheat ] for @xmath119 . in view of this",
    ", the height and the position of the true additional low - temperature maximum can not be extracted unambiguously from the ed data , however , its existence is not questioned by this ambiguity . on the other hand , the rgm ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ specheat ] ) yields a shift of the maximum to lower temperature with increasing frustration .    to illustrate the finite - size effects at low temperature , in fig .",
    "[ c - h0-verschn ] the ed data for the specific heat for @xmath116 and @xmath118 and different chain lengths are plotted .",
    "as already discussed above , the first four digits of the @xmath137 data for @xmath108 and @xmath42 coincide down to @xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) for @xmath116 ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "( note again that for @xmath105 the corresponding value @xmath161 is much larger . ) below @xmath136 finite - size effects become relevant ( cf .",
    "[ c - h0-verschn ] ) . however , from fig .",
    "[ c - h0-verschn ] it is also evident that the extra low - temperature finite - size peak behaves monotonously with @xmath162 .",
    "hence a finite - size extrapolation of the height @xmath163 and the position @xmath164 of the extra peak is reasonable .",
    "we have tested several extrapolation schemes and found that a three - parameter fit based on the formula @xmath165 is well appropriate to extrapolate both @xmath163 and @xmath164 to @xmath166 .",
    "the results of such an extrapolation are shown as filled squares in fig .",
    "[ c - h0-verschn ] .",
    "the extrapolated data points indicate that the extra peak indeed is a finite - size effect and it vanishes for @xmath167 .",
    "however , it is also obvious that the characteristic steep decay of the specific heat down to @xmath78 starts at lower temperature @xmath168 when approaching the zero - temperature critical point ( we find @xmath169 , and @xmath170 for @xmath171 , and @xmath118 , respectively ) .",
    "this behavior is in accordance with the shift of the low - temperature rgm maximum in @xmath3 mentioned above and is relevant for low - temperature experiments on quasi-1d ferromagnets .",
    "finally , let us mention that in an early paper by tonegawa and harada@xcite and also recently by heidrich - meisner et al.@xcite and lu et al.@xcite a double - maximum structure in @xmath3 was already found for @xmath172 , however , with a low - temperature maximum that becomes much more pronounced approaching the critical point . in this case",
    ", the low - temperature peak in @xmath137 was ascribed to excitations from a singlet gs to a low - lying ferromagnetic multiplet.@xcite in our case @xmath173 . above the fully polarized ferromagnetic gs multiplet",
    "many low - lying multiplets exist , and the appearance of the additional low - temperature maximum is attributed to a more subtle interplay between all of these low - lying states .",
    "in this paper we explored the influence of the nnn coupling @xmath174 on the thermodynamic properties of the 1d spin-1/2 heisenberg ferromagnet using ed and rgm methods .",
    "the results of both methods are in qualitatively good agreement .",
    "we found that the critical behavior of the susceptibility @xmath2 and the correlation length @xmath1 is not changed by the frustrating @xmath5 .",

    "another interesting feature is the appearance of a double - maximum structure in the specific heat @xmath3 , where the additional frustration - induced low - temperature maximum was found by ed ( rgm ) to occur for @xmath178 @xmath179 .",
