    "ultra - compact dwarfs are low mass stellar systems with properties in between those of bright globular clusters and the most compact dwarf elliptical galaxies . since their discovery ucds have been linked to galaxy clusters . initially found in the fornax cluster ( hilker et al .  1999 ; drinkwater et al .",
    "2000 ) ucds have been reported in virgo , centaurus , hydra , coma and the more distant clusters abell s040 and abell 1689 ( hasegan et al .",

    "( 2011 ) give a detailed account of the ucds present in two hickson compact groups .",
    "recently , and after discovering ucds in field ( ngc 4546 ) and group ( ngc 3923 ) environments norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) claim the ubiquity of ucds in galaxies with populous globular cluster systems ( gcs ) .",
    "a search for ucds is undertaken in the isolated giant elliptical ngc 1132 .",
    "this galaxy is likely the only remnant of a merged galaxy group , or fossil group .",
    "fossil groups have a defining characteristic gap of two magnitudes between the brightest galaxy and the second brightest galaxy .",
    "the temperature , metallicity , and luminosity of the x - ray halo surrounding ngc 1132 are similar to those of galaxy groups ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1999 ) .",
    "analysis of the millenium simulation ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) show that fossil groups assembled their dark matter halos early , accumulating 80% of the present day mass 4 gyr ago ( dariush et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the absence of parent galaxies and thus lack of substructure in fossil groups has been debated as a possible challenge to the @xmath5cdm paradigm , similar to the missing galaxy problem of the local group ( sales et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) .",
    "fossil groups are dynamically evolved environments and due to their early assembly and their fast evolution the dominant galaxy has had time to accrete the most massive surrounding galaxies through dynamical friction ( mulchaey & zabludoff 1999 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies are exempt from the consequences of dynamical friction given that this effect is proportional to the mass of the satellite galaxy . also , given that ram pressure stripping is milder in a fossil group than in the core of a galaxy cluster , ucds formed by downsizing dwarf galaxies ( bekki et al .",
    "2003 ) are expected to survive up to the present day in fossil groups .",
    "this work uses the same method employed by madrid et al .",

    "i the empirical point spread function ( psf ) is created by running the pyraf tasks pstselect , psf , and seepsf .",
    "these tasks respectively select bright unsaturated stars from the image , build the psf by fitting an analytical model ( moffat function ) , and subsample the psf as required by the software used to determine the structural parameters .",
    "structural parameters are determined using ishape ( larsen 1999 ) .",
    "this specialized software convolves the psf with an analytical model of the surface brightness profile of slightly resolved stellar structures such as globular clusters and yields their effective radius , ellipticity , position angle , signal - to - noise ratio , and an estimate of the goodness of fit .",
    "an important parameter to consider when studying low mass stellar systems in different environments is the effective radius or half - light radius ( @xmath17 ) . a king profile ( king 1962 , 1966 ) with a concentration parameter , or tidal to core radius , of c=30 is the most suitable analytical model for fitting the surface brightness profile of globular clusters and ucds ( see paper i ) .",
    "the structural parameters of 1649 point - like sources are derived in both bands .",
    "the values of structural parameters quoted hereafter are those corresponding to the @xmath12 band given its longer exposure time .",
    "this filter is also a better tracer of the mass of globular clusters and ucds .",
    "photometry is performed using an aperture of 4 pixel in radius with the task phot within the daophot package of pyraf , aperture correction is applied using the formulas of sirianni et al .",

    "2005 ) . in color",
    ", ucd candidates must be in the same range defined by the globular cluster system , this is shown in the next section to be @xmath25    in size , ucds are conventionally , but arbitrarily , defined as stellar systems having an effective radius between 10 and 100 parsecs ( see paper i and references therein ) .",
    "ucds must be consistently resolved in both bands , at the distance of 100 mpc this condition is satisfied for sources with @xmath26pc with the deep images analyzed in this work .    in photometric studies , and as a safeguard against contamination by background galaxies ,",
    "the ellipticity of ucds is expected to be between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( blakeslee & barber de graff 2008 , paper i ) .",
    "all ucd candidates fall within that range of ellipticity .",
    "additionally , a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath29 is a requirement for obtaining a reliable estimate of structural parameters with ishape ( harris 2009 ) .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the globular cluster system associated with ngc 1132 is used to define the parameter space where ucds are expected to be present , a detailed analysis of this cmd is not the aim of this paper . for most globular clusters ( @xmath30 of them ) their colors are in the range @xmath31 and their magnitudes between @xmath32 as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this broad color range translates into a metallicity range of @xmath33<-0.10 $ ] given by the color - metallicity transformation of peng et al .",
    "the deduced metallicity range is in agreement with previous metallicity estimates of ucds ( mieske et al .",
    "2004 , evstigneeva et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the vast majority of 1649 globular clusters and ucd candidates identified in the acs images remain unresolved or their @xmath34 is too low to obtain a truly reliable estimate of their structural parameters .",
    "however , 11 sources satisfy the color , magnitude , size , and @xmath34 criteria outlined above to be classified as ucd candidates .",
    "the effective radii of these 11 ucd candidates range from 77.1 pc , for the largest and brightest candidate , to 8.5 pc .",
    "the median effective radius for ucds is @xmath35 pc with a standard deviation of @xmath36 pc . excluding the brightest candidate brings these numbers to @xmath37 pc and @xmath38 pc .",

    "overlap with the brightest globular clusters , the very same is the case for ucds in the core of the coma cluster , i.  e.  they share the same parameter space of the brightest globular clusters associated with ngc 4874 ( paper i ) .      the brightest ucd candidate is a m32-like object located , in projection , @xmath406.6 kpc away from the center of the galaxy .",
    "its effective radius is @xmath3 pc , its magnitude @xmath41 , or two magnitudes brighter than the second brightest ucd candidate , and its is color particularly red @xmath42 . in the framework of a dual formation mechanism for ucds proposed by da rocha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) this candidate is the remaining nucleus of a stripped companion of ngc 1132 due to the clear gap of two magnitudes between the brightest globular clusters and this ucd .",
    "this object is similar to sdss j124155.3 + 114003.7 , the ucd reported by chilingarian & mamon ( 2008 ) at a distance of 9 kpc from m59 .",
    "as stated by norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) no globular cluster system has a luminosity function continuously extending up to such high luminosity .",
    "as shown in paper i , not even the extremely rich globular cluster system of ngc 4874 in the core of the coma cluster has members with magnitudes similar to the brightest ucd candidate .",
    "this object was catalogued by the two micron all sky survey as 2mass-02525121 - 0116193 , its k band magnitude is @xmath43 mag ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) .    a size estimate for the m32 counterpart was also carried out with galfit ( peng et al .",
    "2002 ) using a sersic model with an initial sersic index of @xmath44 ( sersic 1968 ) .",
    "using galfit the best fit for this object has a reduced @xmath45=1.008 and yields @xmath46 , and @xmath47 pc .",
    "the original image of the brightest ucd and the residual after model subtraction with both galfit and ishape is given in figure 2 .",
    "the best fit of two different analytical models and different software leaves a small residual in the core .",
    "similar residuals are found by price et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studying several compact elliptical galaxies in the core of the coma cluster .",
    "the brightest ucd candidate is comparable , but slightly smaller than the compact elliptical galaxies studied by price et al .",
    "( 2009 ) which have effective radii of @xmath48 pc .",
    "this object is also fainter than the price compact ellipticals which have magnitudes ranging from @xmath49 to @xmath50 mag .",
    "photometric and structural parameters of the eleven ucd candidates are presented in table 1 .",
    "an additional 39 sources are positively resolved in both bands and have effective radii between 8.2 pc and 59.7 pc , with a median @xmath51 pc .",
    "while these sources have the size characteristic of ucds their magnitudes fall short of the minimum threshold for the selection criteria .",
    "these extended stellar systems have received several denominations , here we refer to them as extended star clusters .",
    "extended star clusters are plotted as blue squares on the cmd of figure 1 . even if these extended star clusters are not as bright as ucds , in luminosity some of these objects are comparable to @xmath52 centauri .",

    "one of the defining characteristics of ucds is their magnitude - size relation .",
    "ucds are the smallest stellar systems that show a correlation between luminosity ( or mass ) and size ( hasegan et al .",
    "2005 ) , with masses of @xmath53 these objects are indeed at the onset of this relation . in figure 4",
    "the magnitude - size relation for the 11 ucd candidates plotted as red cirlces is evident .",
    "magnitude and @xmath17 for the 11 ucds in figure 4 have a spearman rank correlation coefficient of @xmath54 .",
    "the correlation is not perfect ( i.  e.  @xmath55 ) due to the scatter characteristic of such plots .",
    "no magnitude - size correlation is found for extended star clusters , with @xmath56 , these objects are plotted as blue squares in figure 4 .",
    "the effective radius of globular clusters with masses below @xmath53 do not show any correlation with luminosity either , with a coefficient of @xmath57 derived by mclaughlin ( 2000 ) , that is , almost completely uncorrelated ( i.  e.  @xmath58 ) .",
    "a second correlation for stellar systems with masses of @xmath59 and above is the mass - metallicity relation ( mmr , harris et al .",
    "2006 , strader et al.2006 ) .",
    "ucds also obey this relation .",
    "the mmr is evident in two simple ways in the cmd of figure 1 . at the distance of ngc 1132 ( @xmath60 mpc )",
    "the paradigmatic bimodality of gcs is blurred , however if we consider the measurements presented by da rocha et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for gcs of compact groups at lower redshift the color of the metal - poor subpopulation of globular clusters is @xmath61 . in the cmd of figure 1",

    "the second brightest ucd , located 20.6 kpc away from the galaxy center , is exceptionally blue ( f475w - f850lp)=1.61 and stands out of the mmr .",
    "a second manifestation of the mmr quantified in a simple way is the median color of ucds and extended star clusters .",
    "self - enrichment models ( bailin & harris 2009 ) predict that more massive ( and bigger ) objects migrate in color towards the red .",
    "ucds that are more massive than extended globular clusters have indeed redder colors on average .",
    "the median color for ucds is @xmath63 with @xmath64 while the median color for extended globular clusters is @xmath65 .",
    "the brightest ucd candidate is also the reddest with a color of @xmath42 , this is in agreement with the findings of norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) .",
    "in contrast , the largest extended globular cluster with @xmath66 has a blue color with @xmath67 .",
    "ucds extend the mmr to brighter magnitudes than the end of the globular cluster luminosity function .",
    "in paper i and in this study two highly evolved environments with fundamentally different densities are probed : the core of the coma cluster , the richest galaxy cluster of the nearby universe and an isolated elliptical galaxy in a fossil group . both systems exhibit",
    "similar characteristics of their ucd population with the exception that ucds are present at small galactocentric distance ( projected ) in the fossil group and not in the galaxy cluster .",
    "the presence of ucds at the bright tip of the globular cluster systems of elliptical galaxies appears independent of environment .",
    "given also the evidence given by the works cited in section 1 on the presence of ucds outside galaxy clusters it is natural to believe that ucds are commonly present in all environments .",
    "the results of this work support the thesis put forward by norris & kannappan ( 2011 ) on the ubiquity of ucds in galaxies with populous globular cluster systems irrespective of environment .",
    "only the superior resolution of the hubble space telescope allows for the determination of the structural parameters of ucds in the local universe .",
    "evstigneeva et al .  (",
    "2007 ) searched for ucds in five galaxy groups to no avail using ground based data .",
    "the fact that ucds escaped detection for almost a decade while hst was operational is not a coincidence .",
    "hst can resolve ucds only at relatively low redshift ( d@xmath40 tens to hundreds of mpc ) however at these distances first and second generation instruments onboard hst ( e.g. wfpc2 ) have small field of views that only cover physical scales of @xmath68 kpc .",
    "ucds are difficult to find within the innermost 10 kpc of the host galaxy ( paper i , bekki et al .",
    "2003 , da rocha et al .",
    "2011 ) not only due to the crowding produced by starlight but also due to the destructive effects of the tidal field of the host galaxy ( bekki et al .",
    "an artificial maximum luminosity cutoff usually used in globular cluster studies has also certainly contributed to under - reporting of ucds in the past ( norris & kannappan 2011 ) .",
    "many thanks to l. spitler , j. hurley , w. harris , l. schwartz , and d. croton for their input .",
