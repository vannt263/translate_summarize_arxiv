    "a primary goal of run ii of the lhc will be the further investigation of the higgs boson discovered in 2012 .",
    "current measurements by the atlas and cms collaborations indicate that the couplings of this new state agree with standard model ( sm ) predictions at the 2030% level  @xcite .",
    "these measurements so far only provide information about the higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and to third - generation fermions .",
    "the higgs yukawa couplings to first- and second - generation quarks are currently unknown .",
    "it is extremely difficult to experimentally access these couplings .",
    "they are predicted to be small in the sm , and the inclusive decays of the higgs to these states are swamped by large qcd backgrounds .",
    "these couplings are indirectly constrained weakly by the inclusive higgs production cross section  @xcite .",
    "such constraints only probe the simultaneous deviation of all yukawa couplings .",
    "they do not allow the separate yukawa couplings of the various quarks to be determined .",
    "it was discovered recently that it is possible to explore these couplings using rare exclusive decays of the higgs boson to mesons in association with a photon . the first manifestation of this idea was the suggestion that the higgs coupling to charm quarks could be probed using the exclusive decay @xmath6  @xcite . the enhancement of the branching ratio for this mode compared to initial expectations came from the realization that two distinct production mechanisms give rise to this process :    * the _ direct _ contribution in which the higgs boson decays into a @xmath7 pair , one of which radiates a photon before forming a @xmath4 ; * the _ indirect _ or _ fragmentation _ contribution , in which the higgs boson decays to a @xmath8 and an off - shell @xmath9 , with the @xmath9 then fragmenting into a @xmath4 .    initial considerations of this process  @xcite studied only the direct production mechanism .",
    "the indirect production amplitude is larger , and its interference with the direct mode renders this decay measurable at the lhc and sensitive to the @xmath10 coupling . although this coupling can possibly be accessed at the lhc using charm tagging  @xcite , its phase can only be studied using processes such as this rare decay that involve quantum interference effects .",
    "it was later realized that other exclusive decays of the higgs boson to light mesons in association with either a photon or a heavy electroweak gauge boson can similarly be used to probe the yukawa couplings of the other first- and second - generation quarks  @xcite .",
    "decays to light mesons together with a heavy gauge boson may also be used to probe the structure of the higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "the study of these rare decays at the high - luminosity lhc offers potentially the only way to directly study these couplings in the foreseeable future .",
    "their predicted rates at planned future @xmath11 machines are too small .",
    "only the lhc and future very high - energy hadron colliders produce enough higgs bosons to allow observation of these decays .",
    "initial experimental studies of these channels have begun and appear promising .",
    "one topic needed to further assist these investigations is a set of experimental benchmarks besides the higgs decays that can be used to refine and validate search techniques .",
    "obvious candidates are rare decays of the @xmath0-boson .",
    "its mass is not too much smaller than the higgs mass , and it is also produced primarily at the lhc as an @xmath12-channel resonance .",
    "the set of rare higgs boson decays outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite can be divided into two broad categories based on their experimental signatures :    * the decays @xmath13 where @xmath14 or @xmath5 feature the final state @xmath15 after leptonic decays of the vector quarkonium are required ; * decays of the higgs boson to a light meson such as the @xmath16 plus a photon . in this case",
    "the @xmath16 decays hadronically , and a track - based trigger must be developed .",
    "we focus in this manuscript on the decays @xmath17 , @xmath2 and @xmath18 , which are representative of these two categories .",
    "the decays of the @xmath0-boson to the heavy quarkonium states @xmath4 and @xmath5 were studied in a classic paper by guberina _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ( gkpr ) . in their work gkpr include only the direct production mechanism , and work in the exact non - relativistic limit . as far as we are aware the decay @xmath18 has not been studied in the literature .",
    "our goal in this manuscript is to provide up - to - date theoretical predictions for these rare @xmath0-boson decays for use in lhc searches .",
    "we consider both the indirect and direct contributions to both decays .",
    "for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 final states we use the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) framework  @xcite to perform the calculation .",
    "we cross - check our result using the light - cone distribution amplitude ( lcda ) approach  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of the direct amplitude using both approaches allows us to include the leading @xmath19 qcd corrections and the leading @xmath20 relativistic corrections to the decay .",
    "we compute the @xmath18 decay using the lcda approach , and include the leading - logarithmic qcd corrections that come from the evolution of the lcda from the hard scale @xmath21 down to the phi mass scale , @xmath22 .",
    "we perform a detailed estimate of the remaining sources of theoretical uncertainty affecting both decays .",
    "we find the following final results for the branching ratios :    align b_sm(z j/+ ) & = ( 9.96 1.86 ) 10 ^ -8 , + b_sm(z ( 1s)+ ) & = ( 4.93 0.51 ) 10 ^ -8 , + b_sm(z + ) & = ( 1.17 0.08 ) 10 ^ -8 .",
    "we define the branching ratios as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the total width of the @xmath0-boson .",
    "we use @xmath25 gev from the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "although small , it is possible that the heavy quarkonium branching ratios will be accessible in run ii measurements  @xcite .",
    "compared to the analogous higgs - boson decays  @xcite , the @xmath4 and @xmath16 branching ratios are smaller by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "this is due primarily to the suppression of the indirect amplitude in the @xmath0-boson decays as compared to the higgs decays .",
    "this amplitude proceeds through the @xmath26 effective coupling , which receives contributions from standard model anomaly diagrams .",
    "it was previously suggested in the literature that the indirect amplitude could give large contributions to the similar process of a @xmath0-boson decaying to a pseudoscalar meson and a photon  @xcite .",
    "we show here that there is no such enhancement for this process .",
    "the indirect amplitude depends on the difference between fermion masses within a generation , and goes to zero for heavy fermions such as the top quark .",
    "the only numerically - relevant contributions therefore come from the tau lepton , the charm quark and the bottom quark .",
    "since these fermion masses are small , the indirect amplitude is small for this process .",
    "furthermore , the landau - yang theorem  @xcite prevents the decay of the @xmath0-boson to two on - shell photons , and therefore requires that the indirect amplitude for the process considered here vanishes in the limit @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that there can be no enhancement with respect to the direct amplitude by the ratio @xmath28 , as there is for the analogous higgs decays .",
    "these effects leads to an indirect amplitude with a magnitude less than 1% of the direct - amplitude magnitude .",

    "we will see that the indirect amplitude gives a small contribution to the branching ratio , justifying our neglect of a theoretical error on this term .",
    "all of these sources of uncertainty are added in quadrature separately for both the direct and indirect amplitudes to produce an uncertainty on each contribution . both the direct and indirect amplitudes are then allowed to vary independently within their allowed errors , and the envelope of these deviations is then taken to produce a final error on the branching ratio prediction .",
    "using the prescriptions above , and taking the total width of the @xmath0-boson from the pdg , we arrive at the following prediction for the j/@xmath185 branching ratio in the standard model : @xmath186 we make a few comments on this result . if the indirect amplitude were set to zero , the central value of the branching ratio would instead be @xmath187 .",

    "if this were turned off , the branching ratio would decrease by 6% .",
    "the relative error on the branching ratio is 18.7% . in order of importance , the three largest contributions to the error budget are the parametric uncertainty on @xmath179 , our estimate of the missing @xmath188 corrections , and the scale variation in the direct amplitude .",
    "if the error on @xmath179 is removed , the relative uncertainty decreases to only 10.3% .",
    "this parametric uncertainty dominates the error budget .",
    "if all three sources of uncertainty are turned off , the relative uncertainty becomes only 2.1% .",
    "we study next the decay @xmath168 , which is very similar to the @xmath4 mode just considered .",
    "the primary difference in this case is that the quarkonium mass effects that we have neglected go like @xmath189 , which reaches the percent level .",
    "since this is still a small correction , we continue to neglect such effects .",
    "we use the following values for the parameters which enter the direct amplitude : @xmath190 the values for wave - function at the origin and the matrix element @xmath171 are taken from ref .  @xcite . for the indirect amplitude ,",

    "we arrive at the following prediction : @xmath194 the indirect amplitude again has a sub-1% effect on this branching ratio .",
    "the largest sources of uncertainty are the parametric error on @xmath195 and the scale variation .",
    "we now consider the decay @xmath3 .",
    "the branching ratio for this process additionally depends on the decay constant @xmath150 and the coefficient @xmath160 that appears in the twist-2 lcda .",

    "we find the result : @xmath197 the indirect amplitude has a small effect on this branching ratio ; setting it to zero leads to a 1% increase in the branching ratio .",
    "however , the evolution of @xmath160 from the input scale of 1 gev to @xmath173 has a large effect on the rate . without this effect ,",
    "the branching ratio would be @xmath198 , almost 30% larger .",
    "the dominant sources of uncertainty are the parametric errors on @xmath150 and @xmath160 .",
    "if these were removed , the remaining estimated error would drop to the 1.3% .",
    "in this manuscript we have studied the rare decays @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath199 .",
    "our motivation in considering these processes is that they serve as benchmark processes for similar rare decays of the higgs boson to mesons that may reveal whether the yukawa structure in nature is indeed that predicted by the standard model .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of all contributions which lead to these rare @xmath0-boson decays , including both the direct and indirect amplitudes . for the heavy quarkonium",
    "decays we utilized the nrqcd framework , and included the leading relativistic and @xmath19 corrections . for the @xmath16 decay we used the lcda approach and included the leading - logarithmic qcd corrections . in both cases",
    "we carefully considered all sources of parametric and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the dominant uncertainties for both processes are parametric in origin : for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 modes the largest error is from knowledge of the wave - functions , while for the @xmath16-meson the two largest sources are the decay constant @xmath150 and the lcda itself . if necessary",
    ", it may be possible to reduce these in the future with a combination of improved experimental data and lattice calculations .",
    "although small , there is a probability that the @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays will be observed at run ii of the lhc .",
    "the final state is clean , consisting of two leptons and a photon that reconstruct to the @xmath0 mass peak if a leptonic decay of the quarkonium is demanded .",
    "although this further reduces the branching ratio , the inclusive @xmath0 production cross section at even the 8 tev lhc is 34 nb  @xcite .",
    "almost @xmath200 @xmath0-bosons were produced at the 8 tev lhc run , and branching ratios of @xmath201 should soon be accessible .",
    "the observation of the @xmath16 decay would require a new trigger , since the @xmath16 does not have an appreciable leptonic decay .",
    "given the importance of this mode for the study of higgs boson properties , we believe that the development of this trigger it should be pursued by the lhc collaborations .",
