    "the analog of correlated photon pair production @xcite has recently been demonstrated using atoms .",

    "the underlying physics is very similar and thus theoretical descriptions should be applicable to both processes .",
    "the experiment using four wave mixing of metastable helium atoms in particular has yielded detailed information about the atomic pair correlations .",
    "efforts to treat the experimental situations are therefore highly desirable .",
    "theoretically , the description of condensate collisions in the spontaneous scattering regime requires a formulation that extends beyond the mean - field model @xcite . in previous work on",
    "spherical gaussian wave packets , within perturbative approach , we have given analytical formulas for the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we extend our method to anisotropic condensates to give an analytic description of the correlation properties of spontaneously emitted atom pairs in a geometry much closer to and in good agreement with the experiment @xcite .",
    "numerical approaches using truncated wigner method @xcite and positive - p method @xcite have also been used , in particular to give insight into the stimulation regime where bosonic enhancement comes to play .    here",
    ", we use the model of colliding condensates to examine two types of correlations .",
    "first we shall focus on atom pairs originating from the same two body scattering event .",
    "these consequently have nearly opposite momenta .",
    "thus we analyze the opposite - momenta correlations of atom pairs .",
    "second , we examine two body correlations between atoms scattered with nearly collinear momenta , a manifestation of the hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) effect @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the demonstration of a two particle correlation requires a measurement of the conditional probability of detecting a particle at position @xmath0 given that a particle was detected at @xmath1 .",
    "this probability is proportional to the second order correlation function @xmath2 of the field @xmath3 of atoms , i.e. @xmath4 we shall pay particular attention to correlations in momentum space and compare these results with experimental data of @xcite . a careful comparison of a numerical treatment based on the positive - p method @xcite with the experiment @xcite indicated reasonable agreement , but one of the limitations of the method , the short collision duration which could be simulated , left some unresolved questions . in particular",
    ", energy conservation is a less stringent constraint for short collision times , and thus one can wonder about the role this constraint plays in the experiment .",
    "the treatment given here is not subject to this limitation and also agrees fairly well with the experiment for most of the experimentally accessible observables .",
    "one observable quantity however , the averaged width of the collinear correlation function in a direction orthogonal to the symmetry axis , disagrees with the experiment and with ref . @xcite . in our treatment , it is precisely the requirement of energy conservation that is at the origin of the difference . at the end of the paper we shall discuss possible explanations of this discrepancy .",

    "@xcite ]    let us first describe the experiment in which a collision of two bose - einstein condensates of metastable helium produces a cloud of scattered atoms .",
    "a condensate of approximately 10@xmath5 he@xmath6 atoms is created in a cigar - shaped magnetic trap with axial and radial trapping frequencies of @xmath7 47  hz and @xmath8 1150  hz respectively .",
    "three laser beams are used to transfer the atoms into two counter - propagating wave - packets by a raman process , with a transfer efficiency of about 60% .",
    "as the wave - packets counter - propagate with a relative velocity of @xmath9  cm / s , atoms from the two clouds collide via @xmath10-wave scattering , populating a spherical shell in momentum space often referred to as the  halo \"  @xcite . in the experiment ,",
    "about 5% of the atoms are scattered .",
    "in addition to splitting the condensate , the raman transition transfers the atoms into an untrapped magnetic sub - state .",
    "the transferred atoms thus expand freely , falling onto a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) detector that allows the three - dimensional reconstruction of the position of single atoms with an estimated efficiency of 10%  @xcite .",
    "knowing the positions of individual atoms , the initial momenta , and the second order momentum correlation function of the cloud of scattered particles can be computed .",
    "the precision of the measurement is limited by the finite resolution of the mcp .",
    "this factor will be taken into account in our comparison between the theoretical estimates and the experimental results .",
    "to make the comparison , we introduce a simplified model for atom scattering during a collision of two bose - einstein condensate wave - packets . in this model",
    "we assume that two counter - propagating wave - packets constitute a classical undepleted source for the process of scattering .",
    "this concept is introduced in analogy to examples in quantum optics , where a strong coherent laser field is treated as a classical wave and its depletion is neglected @xcite .",
    "we shall simplify the model further on .",
    "since we assume that the two colliding condensates remain undepleted , the population of the @xmath3 field of scattered atoms should be small , as compared to the number of atoms in the condensates .",
    "in such a regime , a bogoliubov approximation is often used @xcite , leading to linearized equations of motion for the quantum fields . in our case",

    "moreover , the coupling constant @xmath14 is related to the atomic mass @xmath15 and @xmath10-wave scattering length @xmath16 of he@xmath6 .    to permit analytic calculations , we model the condensate wave functions @xmath17 as gaussians : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total number of particles in both wave - packets .",
    "the radial ( @xmath20 ) and axial ( @xmath21 ) width of the gaussians are extracted from the initial condensate wave - function @xmath22 which is calculated numerically from the gross - pitaevski equation using an imaginary time method . in practice",
    "we fit @xmath23 with a gaussian function @xmath24 and then use @xmath25 .",
    "we define @xmath20 similarly . here , for simplicity , we neglect the spread of the condensates during the collision .",

    "the function @xmath100 permits an estimate of both the number of scattered atoms and their associated coherence volumes . if the number of scattered atoms is small , coherence volumes are unlikely to overlap , and stimulated scattering is negligible . in this situation",

    "first , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the calculations using the positive p representation are not able to simulate the entire duration of the collision ; indeed only about 20% of the collision time can be simulated .",
    "thus , energy conservation is not as strictly enforced leading to additional broadening in the calculations of ref .  @xcite .",
    "although this effect was discussed in that reference , the problem requires further scrutiny , it is not entirely clear to us which widths are most affected by a short collision time .",
    "second , the experimental observations are also subject to effects not treated here .",
    "it was briefly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite that the mean field interaction between the escaping atoms and the remaining condensates may not be negligible .",
    "it is therefore important to undertake an analysis of their effect on the correlation functions .",
    "finally , an important simplification in the present treatment is the assumption that the condensates do not expand during the collision .",
    "this assumption seems reasonable because most of the atom collisions take place before the clouds have had time to expand .",
