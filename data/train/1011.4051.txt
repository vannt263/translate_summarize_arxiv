    "the study of strongly interacting fermionic systems at finite density and temperature is a challenging task in condensed matter and high energy physics .",
    "analytical methods are limited or not available for strongly coupled systems , and numerical simulation of fermions at finite density breaks down because of the sign problem @xcite .",
    "there has been an increased activity in describing finite density fermionic matter by a gravity dual using the holographic ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "the gravitational solution dual to the finite chemical potential system is the electrically charged ads - reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black hole , which provides a background where only the metric and maxwell fields are nontrivial and all matter fields vanish . in the classical gravity limit , the decoupling of the einstein - maxwell sector holds and leads to universal results , which is an appealing feature of applied holography .",
    "indeed , the celebrated result for the ratio of the shear viscosity over the entropy density @xcite is identical for many strongly interacting theories and has been considered a robust prediction of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "however , an extremal black hole alone is not enough to describe finite density systems as it does not source the matter fields . in holography , at leading order , the fermi surfaces are not evident in the gravitational geometry , but can only be detected by external probes ; either probe d - branes @xcite or probe bulk fermions @xcite . here",
    "we shall consider the latter option , where the free dirac field in the bulk carries a finite charge density @xcite .",
    "we ignore electromagnetic and gravitational backreaction of the charged fermions on the bulk spacetime geometry ( probe approximation ) . at large temperatures , @xmath1",
    ", this approach provides a reliable hydrodynamic description of transport at a quantum criticality ( in the vicinity of superfluid - insulator transition ) @xcite . at small temperatures , @xmath2 , in some cases",
    "sharp fermi surfaces emerge with either conventional fermi - liquid scaling @xcite or of a non - fermi liquid type @xcite with scaling properties that differ significantly from those predicted by the landau fermi liquid theory .",
    "the non - trivial scaling behavior of these non - fermi liquids has been studied semi - analytically in @xcite and is of great interest as high-@xmath3 superconductors and metals near the critical point are believed to represent non - fermi liquids .",
    "what we shall study is the effects of magnetic field on the holographic fermions .",
    "a magnetic field is a probe of finite density matter at low temperatures , where the landau level physics reveals the fermi level structure .",
    "the gravity dual system is described by a ads dyonic black hole with electric and magnetic charges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , corresponding to a @xmath0-dimensional field theory at finite chemical potential in an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "probe fermions in the background of the dyonic black hole have been considered in @xcite ; and probe bosons in the same background have been studied in @xcite .",
    "quantum magnetism is considered in @xcite .",
    "the landau quantization of momenta due to the magnetic field found there , shows again that the ads / cft correspondence has a powerful capacity to unveil that certain quantum properties known from quantum gases have a much more ubiquitous status than could be anticipated theoretically .",
    "a first highlight is the demonstration @xcite that the fermi surface of the fermi gas extends way beyond the realms of its perturbative extension in the form of the fermi - liquid . in ads",
    "/ cft it appears to be gravitationally encoded in the matching along the scaling direction between the bare dirac waves falling in from the uv boundary , and the true ir excitations living near the black hole horizon .",
    "this ir physics can insist on the disappearance of the quasiparticle but , if so , this critical fermi - liquid is still organized around a fermi surface .",
    "the landau quantization , the organization of quantum gaseous matter in quantized energy bands ( landau levels ) in a system of two space dimensions pierced by a magnetic field oriented in the orthogonal spatial direction , is a second such quantum gas property .",
    "we shall describe here following @xcite , that despite the strong interactions in the system , the holographic computation reveals the same strict landau - level quantization . arguably , it is the mean - field nature imposed by large @xmath6 limit inherent in ads / cft that explains this .",
    "the system is effectively non - interacting to first order in @xmath7 .",
    "the landau quantization is not manifest from the geometry , but as we show this statement is straightforwardly encoded in the symmetry correspondences associated with the conformal compactification of @xmath8 on its flat boundary ( i.  e. , in the uv cft ) .",
    "an interesting novel feature in strongly coupled systems arises from the fact that the background geometry is only sensitive to the total energy density @xmath9 contained in the electric and magnetic fields sourced by the dyonic black hole . dialing up the magnetic field is effectively similar to a process where the dyonic black hole loses its electric charge . at the same time , the fermionic probe with charge @xmath10 is essentially only sensitive to the coulomb interaction @xmath11 . as shown in @xcite , one can therefore map a magnetic to a non - magnetic system with rescaled parameters ( chemical potential , fermion charge ) and same symmetries and equations of motion , as long as the reissner - nordstrm geometry is kept",
    ".    translated to more experiment - compatible language , the above magnetic - electric mapping means that the spectral functions at nonzero magnetic field @xmath12 are identical to the spectral function at @xmath13 for a reduced value of the coupling constant ( fermion charge ) @xmath10 , provided the probe fermion is in a landau level eigenstate .",
    "a striking consequence is that the spectrum shows conformal invariance for arbitrarily high magnetic fields , as long as the system is at negligible to zero density .",
    "specifically , a detailed analysis of the fermion spectral functions reveals that at strong magnetic fields the fermi level structure changes qualitatively .",
    "there exists a critical magnetic field at which the fermi velocity vanishes . ignoring the landau level quantization",
    ", we show that this corresponds to an effective tuning of the system from a regular fermi liquid phase with linear dispersion and stable quasiparticles to a non - fermi liquid liquid with fractional power law dispersion and unstable excitations .",
    "this phenomenon can be interpreted as a transition from metallic phase to a `` strange metal '' at the critical magnetic field and corresponds to the change of the infrared conformal dimension from @xmath14 to @xmath15 while the fermi momentum stays nonzero and the fermi surface survives .",
    "increasing the magnetic field further , this transition is followed by a `` strange - metal''-conformal crossover and eventually , for very strong fields , the system always has near - conformal behavior where @xmath16 and the fermi surface disappears .    for some fermi surfaces , this surprising metal-``strange metal '' transition is not physically relevant as the system prefers to directly enter the conformal phase . whether a fine tuned system exists that does show a quantum critical phase transition from a fl to a non - fl is determined by a diophantine equation for the landau quantized fermi momentum as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "perhaps these are connected to the magnetically driven phase transition found in ads@xmath17/cft@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we leave this subject for further work .    overall , the findings of landau quantization and `` discharge '' of the fermi surface are in line with the expectations :",
    "both phenomena have been found in a vast array of systems @xcite and are almost tautologically tied to the notion of a fermi surface in a magnetic field .",
    "thus we regard them also as a sanity check of the whole bottom - up approach of fermionic ads / cft @xcite , giving further credit to the holographic fermi surfaces as having to do with the real world .",
    "next we use the information of magnetic effects the fermi surfaces extracted from holography to calculate the quantum hall and longitudinal conductivities . generally speaking ,",
    "it is difficult to calculate conductivity holographically beyond the einstein - maxwell sector , and extract the contribution of holographic fermions . in the semiclassical approximation , one - loop corrections in the bulk setup involving charged fermions",
    "have been calculated @xcite . in another approach",
    ", the backreaction of charged fermions on the gravity - maxwell sector has been taken into account and incorporated in calculations of the electric conductivity @xcite .",
    "we calculate the one - loop contribution on the cft side , which is equivalent to the holographic one - loop calculations as long as vertex corrections do not modify physical dependencies of interest @xcite .",
    "as we dial the magnetic field , the hall plateau transition happens when the fermi surface moves through a landau level .",
    "one can think of a difference between the fermi energy and the energy of the landau level as a gap , which vanishes at the transition point and the @xmath0-dimensional theory becomes scale invariant . in the holographic d3-d7 brane model of the quantum hall effect",
    ", plateau transition occurs as d - branes move through one another @xcite . in the same model ,",
    "a dissipation process has been observed as d - branes fall through the horizon of the black hole geometry , that is associated with the quantum hall insulator transition . in the holographic fermion liquid",
    "setting , dissipation is present through interaction of fermions with the horizon of the black hole . we have also used the analysis of the conductivities to learn more about the metal - strange metal phase transition as well as the crossover back to the conformal regime at high magnetic fields .",
    "we conclude with the remark that the findings summarized above are in fact somewhat puzzling when contrasted to the conventional picture of quantum hall physics . it is usually stated that the quantum hall effect requires three key ingredients : landau quantization , quenched disorder and ( spatial ) boundaries , i.  e. , a finite - sized sample @xcite .",
    "the first brings about the quantization of conductivity , the second prevents the states from spilling between the landau levels ensuring the existence of a gap and the last one in fact allows the charge transport to happen ( as it is the boundary states that actually conduct ) . in our model",
    ", only the first condition is satisfied .",
    "the second is put by hand by assuming that the gap is automatically preserved , i.  e. that there is no mixing between the landau levels .",
    "there is , however , no physical explanation as to how the boundary states are implicitly taken into account by ads / cft .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we outline the holographic setting of the dyonic black hole geometry and bulk fermions in the section [ section:1 ] . in section [ section:2 ]",
    "we prove the conservation of conformal symmetry in the presence of the magnetic fields .",
    "section [ section:3 ] is devoted to the holographic fermion liquid , where we obtain the landau level quantization , followed by a detailed study of the fermi surface properties at zero temperature in section [ section:4 ] .",
    "we calculate the dc conductivities in section [ section:5 ] , and compare the results with available data in graphene . in section [ section:6 ] , we show that the fermion sign problem is absent in the holographic setting , therefore allowing lattice simulations of finite density matter in principle .",
    "we first describe the holographic setup with the dyonic black hole , and the dynamics of dirac fermions in this background . in this paper , we exclusively work in the probe limit , i.  e. , in the limit of large fermion charge @xmath10 .",
    "we consider the gravity dual of @xmath19-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) with global @xmath20 symmetry . at finite charge density and in the presence of magnetic field , the system can be described by a dyonic black hole in @xmath21-dimensional anti - de sitter space - time , @xmath22 , with the current @xmath23 in the cft mapped to a @xmath20 gauge field @xmath24 in @xmath8 .",

    "we have reproduced the integer qhe of the hall conductivity , which is observed in graphene at moderate magnetic fields . while the findings on equilibrium physics ( landau quantization , magnetic phase transitions and crossovers ) are within expectations and indeed corroborate the meaningfulness of the ads / cft approach as compared to the well - known facts , the detection of the qhe is somewhat surprising as the spatial boundary effects are ignored in our setup .",
    "we plan to address this question in further work .",
    "interestingly , the ads geometry produces several fermi surfaces .",
    "theories where the gravity duals have larger fermion charge @xmath10 posses more fermi surfaces .",
    "we find that , in a multi - fermi surface picture , the hall conductivity is quantized in a way reminiscent of fractional qhe . by reducing the magnetic field , new fermi surfaces open up and the quantization of hall conductivity alternates between two different patterns , corresponding to odd and even number of fermi surfaces .",
    "it turns out that odd number of the fermi surfaces results in iqhe plateaus , while even number of surfaces gives new plateaus characteristic for the fqhe . in a multi - fermi surface picture ,",
    "the quantum hall plateaus show a less regular pattern that agrees with experiments on thin graphite in strong magnetic field @xcite . in our model",
    "it happens due to the fact that as one of several fermi surfaces crosses the landau level , the hall conductivity jumps to a new plateau .",
    "this process is not synchronized between different fermi surfaces .",
    "we associate the average distance between the fermi levels with the energy gap usually arising in the fqhe .",
    "notably , the ads - reissner - nordstrm black hole background gives a vanishing fermi velocity at high magnetic fields .",
    "it happens at the point when the ir conformal dimension of the corresponding field theory is @xmath297 , which is the borderline between the fermi and non - fermi liquids .",
    "vanishing fermi velocity was also observed at high enough fermion charge @xcite .",
    "as in @xcite , it is explained by the red shift on the gravity side , because at strong magnetic fields the fermion wavefunction is supported near the black hole horizon modifying substantially the fermi velocity . in our model , vanishing fermi velocity leads to zero occupancy of the landau levels by stable quasiparticles that results in vanishing regular fermi liquid contribution to the hall conductivity and the longitudinal conductivity .",
    "the dominant contribution to both now comes from the non - fermi liquid and conformal contributions .",
    "we associate such change in the behavior of conductivities with a metal-``strange metal '' phase transition .",
    "experiments on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite support the existence of a finite `` offset '' magnetic field @xmath436 at @xmath63 where the resistivity qualitatively changes its behavior @xcite . at @xmath478",
    ", it has been associated with the metal - semiconducting phase transition @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the temperature dependence of the conductivity in order to understand this phase transition better .",
    "finally , we suggest as a possibly interesting extension of the current ads / cft methodology to compute the gravity dual of the finite density matter in monte - carlo lattice simulations .",
    "this is possible since the sign problem does not arise in the holographic setting of a finite density system .",
    "unlike the conventional field theory setup , finite density in holography is introduced through an electrically charged black hole , and does not involve matter fields ( this is also the reason why holography gives universal results : it does not depend on the expectation values of matter fields at the leading order ) . in the gravity geometry ,",
    "dirac fermions are coupled minimally to the electric field via the covariant derivative .",
    "we have shown that the covariant derivative is anti - hermitian in euclidean signature , leading to the real and positive definite fermion determinant .",
    "this makes it possible to simulate finite density systems on the lattice in the ads - gravity geometry using the curved space - time lattice formulation @xcite . the simplest holographic setup which describes a finite charge density system includes a local @xmath20 gauge symmetry .",
    "finite density systems with global @xmath20 symmetry can not be simulated numerically in field theory due to the problem with the gauss law in the lattice formulation .",
    "another important advantage of performing monte - carlo simulation is that it includes the quantum fluctuations for the gauge and gravitational field .",
    "so far most calculations have been done in the probe limit , with the frozen background for the metric and gauge fields .",
    "analytic calculations which include backreaction are usually involved and are done in the next to leading order , e.g. @xcite .",
    "holographic lattice calculations allow to consider dynamical gauge and gravity fields with matter , which mimics complicated strong interactions in finite density systems and opens a way toward studying novel state of matter and instability mechanisms .",
