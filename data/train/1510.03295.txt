    "detailed studies of the infrared surface brightness of the galactic bulge ( matsumoto et al . 1982 ; blitz & spergel 1991 ) suggested a triaxial ellipsoid or bar with a major axis inclined to the line of sight and closer to us at positive galactic longitudes .",
    "whitelock & catchpole ( 1992 ) see also ( whitelock 1992 , 1993 ) used the distribution of individual bulge mira variables , with distances from a near infrared period - luminosity relation , to show that these stars were in a bar with major axis at @xmath7 to the line of sight .",
    "work on bulge structure to about 2009 was summarized in table 1 of vanhollebeke et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( also reproduced in rich 2013 ) .",

    "2011 ; gerhard et al . 2012 ; dkny et al . 2013 ; pietrukowicz et al .",

    "2015 ) shows that a large range of bar angles have been suggested .",
    "these are generally in the range @xmath8 to @xmath9 but have ranged from @xmath10 ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) to a near spherical distribution ( dkny 2013 ) .",
    "apart from observational uncertainties , one reason for this large range is the way the data have been handled .",
    "the locus of mean distance along lines of sight to the bulge can have quite a different slope to that of the major axis of a bar , derived from the same data using a model ( e.g. wegg 2013 ; pietrukowicz et al .",
    "for instance , for rr lyraes in a central bulge region pietrukowicz et al .",
    "( 2015 ) find an angle of @xmath11 from the mean distances in different directions and @xmath12 from an elliptical model .",
    "it is also now becoming realized that the observed bulge shape may depend on the region of the bulge being studied as well as on the type of tracers used .",
    "whilst , as documented by rich ( 2013 ) , there is a large range in metallicities among bulge stars , there has not been full agreement on the age range in the bulge .",
    "it seems clear that there is an old ( globular cluster age ) population in the bulge from the presence of a strong population of rr lyrae variables and it has often been maintained that the bulge is entirely or almost entirely composed of a very old population ( e.g. from colour - magnitude studies of a field at @xmath13 ( zoccali et al .",
    "clarkson et al . ( 2011 ) put the fraction of the population younger than 5 gyr as at the most 3.4 percent in a field at @xmath14 .",
    "however , a recent study of microlensed stars in the bulge suggests at least a small population of young stars scattered through the bulge ( bensby et al .",
    "bulge mira variables , which show a wide range in periods and for which there is a period age relationship , have , in fact , long suggested a significantly younger population exists there .",
    "nataf ( 2015 ) recently reviewed the evidence for and against the presence of a younger population and concluded that enhanced helium - enrichment would go some way to resolving the controversy .    in the present paper",
    "we report periods and @xmath0 photometry of 648 mira variables in the bulge , chosen to study bulge structure .",
    "these observations are combined with 2mass data for 8057 bulge miras with ogle and/or macho periods , to study the structure of the bulge as a function of age as well as to estimate the distance to the galactic centre .",
    "mira variables are asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars with long pulsation periods ( @xmath15 days ) and large amplitude variations ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 mag ) .",
    "they are cool ( @xmath18k ) and are generally understood to be near the end of the agb evolutionary phase where they are rapidly losing mass ( typically @xmath19 ) .",
    "kinematic and other studies ( e.g. feast & whitelock 2000 ; feast 2008 ) have shown that the period of a mira is a good indication of its age and/or initial mass .",
    "this suggests that whilst the shorter period miras ( some of which are found in metal - rich globular clusters ) are very old with @xmath20 , the bulk of miras in the solar neighbourhood with @xmath21 are @xmath22gyr old .",
    "an age of @xmath23 gyr has been estimated at @xmath24 and in the following we refer to these as of  intermediate age \" .",
    "longer period miras ( including oh / ir stars which are generally long period miras ) are even younger .",
    "as shown by wood ( 2000 ) , agb variables lie on several parallel sequences in a @xmath25 period - luminosity ( pl ) diagram , where each sequence is a different pulsation mode .",
    "the mira variables , which have larger amplitudes than the semi - regular ( sr ) variables , fall mostly on the pl relation corresponding to fundamental pulsation ( sequence c in wood 2000 ) .",
    "however , at the long periods ( @xmath26 days ) the mass - loss rates are sometimes sufficiently high that circumstellar extinction forces the apparent luminosity below the pl relation , unless the extinction is corrected for ( e.g. whitelock et al .",
    "1991 ; glass et al . 1995 ; matsunaga et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in the large magellanic cloud",
    "we also find a few miras above the pl relation ( e.g. feast et al .",
    "1989 ) ; these are believed to be relatively high mass hot - bottom - burning ( hbb ) stars ( whitelock et al .",
    "2003 , menzies et al .",
    "2015 ) possibly pulsating in the first overtone ( feast 2009 ) .",
    "we expect these higher mass objects to be concentrated toward the centre and close to the plane .",
    "their numbers in our fields are expected to be small and should not affect our discussion .",
    "the mira pl relation is potentially a very useful tool for distance scale studies , within the galaxy and at larger distances , as recently summarized by whitelock ( 2013 ) .",
    "however , correction for both interstellar and circumstellar extinction must be made .",
    "this is discussed in section [ ext ] .",
    "the intrinsic colours of galactic long period variables were discussed by feast et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and using these data glass & feast ( 1982 ) isolated an area of a @xmath27 two - colour diagram ( their fig .",
    "1 ) in which dereddened miras are to be found .",
    "this is the referred to as the  mira box \" in the following discussion .",
    "the atmospheric abundance of carbon relative to oxygen determines whether miras are oxygen rich ( @xmath28 ) or carbon rich ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "carbon enrichment happens during third dredge - up ( iben & renzini 1984 ) in stars which have sufficiently large initial masses , and the existence or otherwise of carbon stars has sometimes been taken as evidence for or against the existence of an intermediate mass population .",
    "note that more carbon must be dredged - up in order to produce carbon stars in a population that has a high initial oxygen abundance , as does the bulge , and that dredge - up efficiency depends on the initial abundance as well as on the initial mass , being less efficient at high metallicity or high helium abundance ( karakas et al . 2014 and references therein ) .",
    "the process of hot bottom burning ( e.g. boothroyd , sackmann & ahern 1993 ) prevents intermediate mass stars from becoming carbon rich , particularly at low metallicity , although this is probably not relevant to the galactic bulge .",
    "it should be noted that we assume that the miras in the bulge are all or nearly all oxygen rich .",
    "optical spectroscopy of giants suggests there are only a very few c - rich stars in the bulge ( blanco , mccarthy & blanco 1984 ) and those few are faint , blue and probably the products of binary evolution .",
    "more recently soszynski et al . (",
    "2013 ) have interpreted the ogle light - curves of agb stars as supporting an o - rich character for the majority of the variables .",
    "relatively little is known about the chemistry of highly obscured variables towards the galactic centre , except for those from which oh - masers have been detected ( e.g. sevenster 1999 ) , which are obviously o - rich .",
    "cole & weinberg ( 2002 ) are sometimes quoted as demonstrating the presence of numerous c - stars in the bar of the bulge , on the basis of 2mass colours ( and some unpublished spectra of the inner galaxy ) .",
    "the interpretation of the 2mass colours is based on the assumption that c stars have large @xmath30 colours , as is found in lower metallicity environments such as the lmc . however , the @xmath27 colours of mass - losing o - rich stars are very similar to those of c - stars and these will dominate in the higher metallicity galactic bulge .",
    "ojha et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have questioned the cole & weinberg interpretation of the 2mass colours and ishihara et al .",
    "( 2011 ) show , from a study of stars with both 2mass and akari photometry , that the majority of agb stars in the direction of the galactic centre are o - rich .",

    "the early optical survey of bulge miras by gaposchkin ( 1955 ) , on plates taken by baade and that of oosterhoff et al .",
    "( 1967 , 1968 ) , on plates taken by thackeray and colleagues , as well as the work of lloyd evans ( 1976 ) , indicated a broad range in period with most miras having periods in the range 150 to 450 days in the ngc6522 , sgri and sgrii windows ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "most of the bright iras sources delineating the overall structure of the bulge are mira variables ( feast 1986 ; glass 1986 ) and these tend to have even longer periods ( whitelock et al .",
    "1991 ; glass et al .",
    "1995 ) , with a few as long as @xmath32 days .",
    "it is possible that some of the longest period stars may be due to binary mergers as suggested by renzini & greggio ( 1990 ) ( one probable example of such a process is a carbon rich mira with a period of 551 days in a globular cluster ( matsunaga 2006 ; feast et al .",
    "however , it seems very unlikely that this could be the source of all the 300 to 400 day miras ( see also section [ sec2 ] ) .",
    "thus , taking the presence of long period miras together with the discussion in section [ sec2 ] , indicates a substantial intermediate age population in the bulge .",
    "as mentioned above , whitelock & catchpole ( 1992 ) and whitelock ( 1992 ) observed 141 iras miras in two strips on either side of the galactic centre at @xmath33 and @xmath34 and made the first attempt to use individual stars to probe the structure of the bulge in three dimensions .",
    "a good fit to their data was given by a triaxial bulge inclined at @xmath35 to the line of sight .",
    "the relatively high galactic latitude of the fields indicated a thick bar and there were suggestions of an  x \" structure .",
    "sevenster ( 1999 ) discussed the distribution and velocities of 507 oh / ir stars within @xmath36 & @xmath37 .",
    "she finds evidence for an inclined bar as well as other structures .",
    "she also finds 9 stars from her young sample , lying along an hi feature identified with the 3 kpc arm .",

    "they derive mean distances along various lines of sight and find evidence for a bar at an angle of @xmath38 to the line of sight .",
    "matsunaga , fukushi & nakada ( 2005 ) find 1968 mira variables in the ogle ii data base .",
    "they assign them 2mass colours and note that their surface density is similar to that of the 2.2@xmath39 m cobe image .",
    "the radial distribution shows a tilt towards us in positive longitudes . the work of matsunaga et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on miras close to the centre is discussed in section [ distance ] .",
    "we selected two fields ( the saao fields ) , both at @xmath1 , centred at @xmath40 ( bulge east ) and @xmath41 ( bulge west ) and each covering about 25 square degrees ( see figs .",

    "the schmidt plates were scanned , using both the apm in cambridge and the mama at the paris observatory , to find the long period variable candidates and their periods .",
    "the apm periods were found using phase dispersion minimization ( stellingwerf 1978 ) and the mama periods using the the method described by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1996 ) .",

    "none ' indicates that no extinction correction was made .",
    "the main significance of this table is to show that values of @xmath78 are insensitive to the extinction corrections used .",
    "as expected , neglecting circumstellar extinction leads to an overestimate of @xmath5 , especially for the longer period stars . using the  matsunaga \" method ( section [ ext ] ) leads to @xmath79kpc for the short period group in table  [ tabrt_red ] and @xmath80kpc for the long period group , in good agreement with the  whitelock \" results in that table .",
    "the difference between these two values is probably a consequence of uncertainties in the reddening correction ( see section 6 ) and/or due to the 3-dimensional structure ( see section 8) of the bulge . since the  whitelock \" results are in the saao system and the  matsunaga \" results in the 2mass system , the agreement suggests that conversion between the systems has little effect on the results .",
    "it is evident from , for example fig .",
    "[ modlong ] , that there is a considerable apparent spread in distance moduli of the miras in any one direction .",
    "part of this is no doubt real and part due to uncertainty in the derived moduli .",
    "the effects of truncating the sample in the saao fields was already discussed in section [ largeb ] .",
    "the first part of table 4 shows the effects of similar experiments with the lower latitude stars .",
    "the effects are relatively small , especially considering that the uncertainties in the results are dominated by external errors ( see following paragraph ) .",
    "truncation has the effect of slightly reducing the value of @xmath5 for the miras at low latitude and increasing them for the high latitude saao fields , presumably because of the different balance between foreground and background objects .",
    "matsunaga et al . ( 2009 ) give some discussion of the real ( external ) errors of their value of @xmath5 derived from miras in the region of the centre .",
    "they adopt 0.4kpc for this quantity .",
    "our miras suffer less interstellar absorption than theirs but are further from the centre and are thus not fully model independent .",
    "this is particularly true of the longer period stars which are in a bar structure .",
    "the correction for circumstellar extinction is also more important for these latter stars .",
    "we thus adopt as our best estimate of @xmath5 the value for miras with @xmath81 , restricted to @xmath82 and taking a mean of the last three estimates in table  [ tabrt_red ] ( 8.9kpc ) and adopt matsunaga s error estimate ( 0.4kpc ) .",
    "whether on not there is small scale structure in the bulge is of considerable significance for its formation and evolution .    to illustrate possible structure , we have selected miras within a restricted range of @xmath83 and @xmath84 over which the coverage is fairly uniform , as can be judged by looking at fig .",
    "[ allstar ] .",
    "the miras are projected onto the galactic , @xmath85 plane , after correcting for  whitelock \" extinction .",
    "the plane is divided into 0.15kpc square bins and the number of miras is counted in each bin .",
    "each bin becomes an image pixel and the maximum number of stars in a pixel is 15 in the short period group and 7 in the long .",
    "the maximum number of stars is used to scale the resulting image and normalise it to an intensity count of 255 . the image",
    "is then smoothed and doubled in size to make it more legible .",
    "images for the short and long period miras are shown in fig .",
    "[ miraclump ] .",
    "the restriction in @xmath83 and @xmath84 means that the images do not correspond to the subsets of data given in table  [ tabrthet ] .     and",
    "@xmath86 , over which the areal coverage is nearly uniform .",
    "the numbers are the total number of miras in the image.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ miraclump ] there is a strong contrast between the spatial distribution of old @xmath87 and intermediate age @xmath88 miras .",
    "the short period group show a relatively smooth centrally concentrated distribution .",
    "the long period group show a clumpy structure as well as evidence of the tilted bar to which the two main clumps at 6.8 and 8.6kpc seem to belong .     and",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath88 , overlain on fig . 6 ( grey circles ) of mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) , showing peaks in their red clump stars .",
    "their distance scale is matched to ours.,width=321 ]    in fig .",
    "[ mirasmoothmcw ] the clumping in the long period miras is compared with the distribution of red clump stars found by mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) in the @xmath89 plane , shown in their fig .",
    "they interpret these concentrations as the wings of an x shaped or triaxial bar , seen almost edge on to our line of sight , though this interpretation has been disputed ( lee , joo & chung 2015 ) .",
    "the correspondence between some of their clumps and ours , shown in fig .",
    "[ mirasmoothmcw ] , suggests that the red clump stars and the long period miras have similar distributions .",
    "taken together with the results of the previous paragraph , this would indicate a more clumpy structure in a ( younger ) triaxial or x - shaped bar than in the older part of the bulge .",
    "it has been proposed that the bulge formed from the infall and eventual merger of large massive lumps ( e.g. noguchi 1999 , immeli et al .",
    "2004 , ferraro et al .",
    "2009 , massari et al . 2015 ) whether they could be long enough lasting to explain the observed clumping is not clear .    when looking at the structures , shown in fig .",
    "[ miraclump ] and fig .",
    "[ mirasmoothmcw ] , it is important to remember that they lie within a slice , which passes through the centre of the galaxy between 350pc and 600pc above the galactic plane .",
    "we have obtained periods and @xmath0 photometry for 648 mira variables in two outer fields in the direction of the galactic bulge and combined it with 8057 miras found in the ogle and macho surveys of the inner bulge .",
    "distances were derived from a period - luminosity relation together with corrections for interstellar and circumstellar extinction . in both our inner and outer regions",
    "the longer period miras , tracers of an intermediate age population , give evidence of a tilted bar - like structure .",
    "the older , shorter period miras do not show this .",
    "the longer period miras also show a more clumpy structure than the shorter period ones , possibly part of an x - structure .",
    "we estimate a distance to the galactic centre in satisfactory agreement with other estimates .    the change of mira distribution with period , besides showing the complex structure of the bulge ,",
    "also indicates that the longer period stars there , are fundamentally different from the shorter period ones .",
    "it therefore supports the view that the longer period miras in the bulge belong to an intermediate age population , as such stars do elsewhere , and are not , for instance , the progeny of the mergers of old ( low mass ) stars .",
    "the exact age of that intermediate age population may depend on abundance details and particularly on the level of helium enrichment .",
    "we are grateful to the following people who took part in the infrared photometry programme at sutherland , brian carter , dave laney and enrico olivier .",
    "mwf and paw gratefully acknowledge a research grant from the sa national research foundation .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for their comments and specifically for raising the question of the helium abundance . this paper uses observations made at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",

    "<S> we report periods and @xmath0 observations for 648 oxygen - rich mira variables found in two outer bulge fields at @xmath1 and @xmath2 and combine these with data on 8057 inner bulge miras from the ogle , macho and 2mass surveys , which are concentrated closer to the galactic centre . </S>",
    "<S> distance moduli are estimated for all these stars . </S>",
    "<S> evidence is given showing that the bulge structure is a function of age . the longer period miras ( @xmath3 , age @xmath4 gyr and younger ) show clear evidence of a bar structure inclined to the line of sight in both the inner and outer regions . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the shorter period ( metal - rich globular cluster age ) miras , appears spheroidal in the outer bulge . in the inner region </S>",
    "<S> these old stars are also distributed differently from the younger ones and possibly suggest a more complex structure . </S>",
    "<S> these data suggest a distance to the galactic centre @xmath5 , of 8.9kpc with an estimated uncertainty of @xmath6kpc . the possible effect of helium enrichment on our conclusions is discussed .    </S>",
