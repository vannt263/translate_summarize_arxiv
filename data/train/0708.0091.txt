    "in a rayleigh - bnard experiment , a horizontal viscous fluid layer is heated from below .",
    "when the temperature difference between upper and lower sides is small , heat transfer solely occurs through thermal conduction .",
    "yet once beyond a critical temperature difference , a regular pattern of convection cells or rolls emerges ( bnard , 1901 ) . this sudden shift from conduction to convection",
    "is referred to as the rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) instability , and is often quoted as an archetypal example of self - organization in non - equilibrium systems ( nicolis and prigogine , 1989 ; prigogine , 1967 ) .    intuitively , it makes sense to try to apply the concept of self - organization in non - equilibrium systems to ecologicaly systems , as there are similarities between ecological and physical systems . like the rayleigh - bnard set - up",
    ", ecological systems are open systems that receive a throughput of energy and/or mass via coupling to two environments ( morowitz , 1968 ; schrdinger , 1944 ) .",
    "these two environments are typically large reservoirs and they drive the system from equilibrium .",
    "consider the example of a laboratory chemostat ecosystem ( smith and waltman , 1995 ) .",
    "this is a prime example of a chemotrophic ecosystem whereby a resource of energetic high quality chemical substrate is pumped from a reservoir into the system . in the ecosystem",
    "this resource is degraded into low quality waste products which are emitted to the waste reservoir .",
    "when there is low feeding of resource , no biota can survive , and the resource is degraded by abiotic processes only .",
    "but when the feeding is above a critical threshold , biota can survive by consuming the resource .",
    "there is a sudden shift from a lifeless to a living state . in other words , the energetic quality difference between incoming and outgoing chemical substrates",
    "is exploited by various abiotic and biotic processes .",
    "the latter biotic processes contain the biomass synthesis and turnover of consumer micro - organisms feeding on the resource .    so it is tempting to look for a deeper connection .",
    "can one compare biological processing with convection ?",
    "both mechanisms involve self - organizing structures , biological cells or convection cells , that can only survive after a critical threshold .",
    "both energetic pathways , biotic resource conversion and thermal convection , degrade energy from high quality to low quality form . and these energetic pathways are additional to the abiotic conversion or thermal conduction processes of the background .    here",
    ", our ambition is to examine the link between ecological processes and convective fluid motions in a quantitative way .",
    "the first part of this article contains a highly intriguing result : the mathematical expressions of the resource - consumer chemostat ecosystem dynamics are exactly the same as the dynamics that describes the basics of the rayleigh - bnard system .",
    "furthermore , not only are the mathematical equations identical , also the physical / ecological interpretations give appealing results .",
    "particularly , by looking at the energetic pathways of the ecosystem , the ecological quantities can be mapped to the quantities used in the fluid system and vice versa .",
    "the second part tries to extend the correspondence between fluid convection and ecosystem functioning to include new processes .",
    "we will study two extensions .",
    "first , one can look at ecological competition and translate the notion of competitive fitness to the fluid system .",
    "the convection cells are in darwinian competition with each other and the fittest ones will survive",
    ". one can generalize the lorenz model to include this fluid competition . as the size of a convection cell will depend on the fitness measure",
    ", we will demonstrate that the mathematical identity of the ecological and the fluid dynamics predicts the experimentally correct size of the cells at the onset of convection .",
    "second , one can look at ecological predation . translating this notion to the fluid system leads to a new conjecture to extend the lorenz model in order to describe more complex convection patterns .",
    "these new patterns only appear when the system is driven beyond a second critical value for the temperature gradient .",
    "the predatory behavior in the convective fluid system leads us to a conjecture which we will not prove , but will be successfully tested by looking at the energy dissipation .",
    "let us start by deriving the dynamics that describes the rayleigh - bnard ( rb ) convective fluid system , named after bnard ( 1901 ) and rayleigh ( 1916 ) who were the first to study this system experimentally and theoretically .",
    "a full mathematical treatment of thermal convection requires the combined solution of the heat transport , navier - stokes and incompressibility equations , resulting in a set of five coupled non - linear partial differential equations ( chandrasekhar , 1961 ; rayleigh , 1916 ) .    rather than solving this full set , we employ the approximation adopted by lorenz ( 1963 ) , which became famous as it gave an impulse to the development of chaos theory .",
    "the model describes the lowest modes of an expansion of the temperature and velocity fields for a rb system with free - free boundary conditions ( see e.g. getling 1998 ) . in appendix",
    "[ appendix xyz ] , the derivation of the lorenz system is given in a way that will suit our further discussion . a non - linear set of three ordinary differential equations",
    "is obtained , with three variables ( see fig . [ yzandxfig ] ) : @xmath0 measures the rotational rate of the rolls and represents the maximal velocity at the bottom of the rolls .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are temperature deviations , where the linear profile of the conduction state is taken as a reference .    ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath3 ) and horizontal velocity ( @xmath4 ) profiles at three vertical sections ( dashed lines ) are shown .",
    "these vertical sections are parallel with the axes of the convection rolls , where the fluid is moving up , moving horizontal or moving down .",
    "the thin linear profiles correspond with the conduction state , the thick profiles with the convection state .",
    "as indicated , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are temperature deviations and @xmath0 is the velocity at the bottom of a roll . ]    with these three variables , the xyz lorenz system is rich enough to describe the rayleigh - bnard instability , the sudden shift from conduction to convection .",
    "but there is an even simpler model , the xz system with only two variables , that is rich enough as well .",
    "it is this xz model that allows us to make the correspondence . roughly speaking",
    ", we will perform an averaging over the horizontal directions , such that only the average vertical profile remains . as @xmath1 is the temperature deviation in horizontal direction ,",
    "it is this variable that will disappear after the averaging .",
    "specifically , this is done by making the pseudo steady state assumption @xmath5 for the variable @xmath1 .",
    "the latter becomes a constant and the dynamics turns into : @xmath6 with @xmath7 the height of the fluid layer , @xmath8 a geometric factor such that @xmath9 is the width of the straight convection rolls , @xmath10 the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath11 the gravitational acceleration , @xmath12 the heat conduction coefficient , @xmath13 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath14 the temperature gradient .",
    "this important quantity is the thermodynamic gradient that drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "@xmath15 is the high temperature of the heat reservoir below the fluid layer and @xmath16 is the low temperature of the heat reservoir above the layer .    for further reference",
    ", we will also need measures for the temperatures at the middle and the lower halve of the fluid layer .",
    "define @xmath17 as the horizontally average temperature at height @xmath18 , and @xmath19 fig .",
    "[ thfig ] shows the interpretation of @xmath15 as a temperature measure for a linearized temperature profile in the lower half of the fluid layer .",
    "( due to symmetry in the approximation leading to the lorenz system , we will not have to include the upper half of the fluid layer . )    .",
    "the lower half of the fluid layer is shown , with the vertical ( horizontally averaged ) temperature profiles in the conduction state ( thin line ) , the convection state ( thicker line ) and the linearized convection profile ( thickest line ) .",
    "the variables @xmath2 and @xmath15 are at height @xmath20 . ]",
    "next , we discuss the ecosystem model , which is in essence a simple chemotrophic resource - consumer food web model , one of the mainstay models of ecology ( e.g. yodzis and innes , 1992 ) .",
    "consumer organisms are feeding on some food resource ( r ) , which is partly converted to consumer biomass ( c ) and partly to waste product ( w ) . for reference",
    ", one can think of a chemostat set - up where a chemical reactor tank contains a monoculture of micro - organisms that are feeding on a chemical substrate like methane or glucose , while respiring @xmath21 .    .",
    "the color denotes the energetic quality of the substances , from high ( red ) to low ( light yellow ) . ]",
    "figure [ rcwmodelfig ] gives a schematic overview of the ecosystem coupled with the two environments ( denoted with the superscripts @xmath22 ) .",
    "there are two environmental compartments , the resource at constant concentration @xmath23 and the waste at constant concentration @xmath24 ) and three ecosystem compartments , with variable concentrations @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the resource , the consumer biomass and the waste respectively . in appendix",
    "[ appendix rcw ] , the complete dynamics of the resource - consumer - waste ( rcw ) ecosystem is given , explaining the fluxes @xmath28 between the compartments .",
    "however , as we will see , the correspondence only works in a limiting case , whereby roughly speaking we will average over the waste concentrations of the system and the environment .",
    "specifically , this can be done by taking a very small relaxation time for the exchange of the waste between the ecosystem and the reservoir .",
    "this means that by studying the ecosystem at longer time scales than this relaxation time , the dynamics for w is forced to be in a pseudo steady state condition .",
    "hence , w is no longer a variable and we end up with the resource - consumer ( rc ) model , with two dynamical equations for two variables : @xmath29 with , @xmath30 the resource exchange rate parameter , @xmath31 the abiotic conversion ( from r to w ) rate parameter , @xmath32 the consumer growth rate parameter , @xmath33 the yield factor for the consumer growth , @xmath34 the consumer decay ( biomass turnover ) rate parameter , and @xmath35 the equilibrium constant for the chemical reaction ( oxidation ) from r to w which always slowly proceeds at the background .",
    "this is the well - known chemostat dynamics ( smith and waltman , 1995 ) , which is extended in two ways : first , abiotic conversion is included in terms of chemical oxidation with parameters @xmath31 and @xmath36 .",
    "second , instead of the classical dependence of the growth on the resource @xmath25 , the growth is now made dependent on @xmath37 .",
    "this is done for thermodynamic consistency : at chemical equilibrium , biomass synthesis should also cease .",
    ".two corresponding models with analogous mechanisms for gradient degradation [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the abiotic conversion is a chemical reaction with equilibrium constant @xmath35 and a constant abiotic conversion rate parameter @xmath31 . the latter abiotic conversion rate is increased due to a parallel biotic conversion , described by a simple linear functional response with parameter @xmath32 .",
    "this biotic conversion has two parts : a fraction of the resource is used for consumer growth , the other part of the resource turns immediately into waste . from a thermodynamic perspective",
    ", the latter resource turnover is necessary to drive the growth process .",
    "this fractioning is described by the yield parameter @xmath38 : this is the growth efficiency which denotes the amount of resource required to build up one unit of biomass .",
    "the third metabolic transformation is the biotic decay ( biomass turnover ) , represented by the rate constant @xmath34 .",
    "when the resource is turned into waste , the latter is emitted into the waste reservoir from the environment .",
    "the latter has a constant waste concentartion @xmath24 and the exchange flux can be described as @xmath39    putting the two exchange fluxes and the three metabolic fluxes together , the complete dynamics for the resource concentration @xmath40 , the consumer biomass concentration @xmath41 and the waste concentration @xmath42 now look like @xmath43 this is the rcw model .",
    "next , we have to simplify this model to the rc model , by assuming @xmath44 to be very large .",
    "this means that the relaxation time of the waste exchange is negligibly small , and we get the condition that @xmath45 , resulting into ( [ dyn c_r]-[dyn c_c ] ) .",
    "in this appendix , we will give all approximations and a schematic derivation in order to arrive at the lorenz system for the rayleigh - bnard convective fluid ( see berge and pomeau , 1984 or lorenz , 1963 ) .",
    "* there are no pressure terms in the energy balance equation .",
    "* the heat conduction coefficient @xmath12 and the kinetic viscosity @xmath13 are constants . *",
    "the local density field @xmath46 depends on the temperature as @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 the constant reference density and temperature , @xmath3 the local temperature field , and @xmath10 the constant thermal expansion coefficient . * the above dependence of the density on the temperature is taken into account only in the gravitational force term in the momentum balance equation . at other places in the equations",
    ", we will write the density as @xmath48 . * the fluid is incompressible ( except in the thermal expansion term ) : @xmath50 , which results in an equality between heat capacities at constant pressure and volume : @xmath51 , or it can be written in terms of the velocity field @xmath52 as : @xmath53 * the local internal energy differential is @xmath54 .    with these approximations ,",
    "the heat transport equation can be derived from an energy balance equation , and looks like @xmath55 the first term on the right hand side is the advective heat transport term , and the second is the heat conduction term .",
    "the equation for the velocity field is derived from the momentum balance , and results into the navier - stokes equation . in the boussinesq approximation",
    ", this leads to @xmath56 with @xmath57 the pressure field , @xmath11 the gravitational acceleration and @xmath58 the unit vector in the vertical z - direction . on the right hand side",
    "we see respectively the advection term , the pressure gradient term , the external gravitational force term and the viscous diffusion term .    as a final step , in order to fully describe our system , we need boundary conditions .",
    "the boundary condition for the temperature is simply @xmath59 for the velocity , we have @xmath60 because there is no fluid flowing out of the layer .",
    "this is not enough , and we need another condition on the velocity .",
    "we will take free - free boundary conditions to make the description of the solutions easier .",
    "this gives @xmath61    in summary , we have five partial differential equations : three from the three velocity components , one from the incompressibility condition and one from the temperature .",
    "our five local variables are the velocity , pressure and temperature fields .",
    "lorenz made some further assumptions in order to turn these five p.d.e.s into three o.d.e.s with only three global variables .",
    "due to ( [ div v ] ) , one can write the velocity field as @xmath62 , with @xmath63 the streamfunction . we know from experiment that at the onset of convection ( near the critical gradient ) , a convection roll pattern will arise ( getling , 1998 ) .",
    "suppose that the axis of the rolls are along the horizontal y - direction .",
    "hence , there will be no @xmath64 component . the simplest way to obtain",
    "this is by assuming @xmath65 .      as a final step",
    ", we will expand the temperature and @xmath67 fields in fourier modes , taking the boundary conditions into account , and we will retain only three of these modes : @xmath68 with the width of the convection cell equal to @xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ yzandxfig ] a physical interpretation is given to the variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "plugging these expressions into the above partial differential equations ( [ dyn t ] ) and ( [ curlpdev ] ) , and collecting the factors with the same spatial dependence , gives : @xmath69 as can be seen , the system does not close because there is a @xmath70 term .",
    "a final approximation consists of taking this cosine equal to one .",
    "we finally arrive at the lorenz equations , which we will call the xyz model .",
    "next , we have to simplify this xyz model to the xz model , by assuming the pseudo steady state condition for @xmath1 ( i.e. taking @xmath5 ) , resulting into ( [ dyn x]-[dyn z ] ) .",
    "we conclude this appendix with an important remark .",
    "there are two important approximations for the xz model .",
    "the first is the cancelation of the cosine factor in ( [ dyn y lorenz with cos ] ) .",
    "therefore , solutions of the lorenz system are not exact solutions of the complete fluid system in the boussinesq approximation . in this sense , the result of section [ competitive exclusion ] is not trivial , because we arrived at the correct answer whereas the underlying dynamics does not give exact solutions .",
    "our second approximation is the pseudo steady state restriction .",
    "this means that the steady states of the xz system are also steady states of the xyz model ( but as mentioned above , not necessarily of the complete fluid system ) . in this article",
    "we mostly restricted the discussion to the steady states of the xz model , but one should be cautious to use this model to try to find correct transient solutions for the xyz or the complete fluid systems . as an example , the xyz system has chaotic solutions with unstable steady states , whereas these chaotic solutions are absent in the xz model .",
    "the latter has always stable steady states ."
