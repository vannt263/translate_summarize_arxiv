    "frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been widely adopted in both cellular systems , such as long - term evolution ( lte ) and wi - fi systems @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of ofdm modulation is to convert an intersymbol interference ( isi ) channel into multiple isi - free subchannels and thus reduces the demodulation complexity at the receiver @xcite .",
    "however , since each symbol is only transmitted over a parallel flat fading subchannel , the conventional ofdm technique may not collect multipath diversity , it thus performs worse than single carrier transmission @xcite . furthermore , ofdm has high peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) of the transmitted signals , which may affect its applications in broadband wireless communications .",
    "single - carrier frequency domain equalization ( sc - fde ) is an alternative approach to deal with isi with low transmission papr @xcite .",
    "however , induced by both fast fourier transform ( fft ) and inverse fft ( ifft ) operations at the receiver , sc - fde suffers from the drawback that transmitter and receiver have unbalanced complexities @xcite . as a result , ofdm is more suitable for downlink with high transmission speed , whereas sc - fde can be applied for uplink that reduces papr and transmitter complexity as in lte @xcite .",
    "vector ofdm ( v - ofdm ) for single transmit antenna systems first proposed in @xcite converts an isi channel to multiple vector subchannels where the vector size is a pre - designed parameter and flexible . for each vector subchannel",
    ", the information symbols of a vector may be ( are ) isi together . since the vector size is flexible , when it is @xmath0 , v - ofdm coincides with the conventional ofdm .",
    "when the vector size is @xmath1 , each vector subchannel may have two information symbols in isi . when the vector size is large enough , say , the same as the ifft size , then the maximal number of information symbols are in isi and it is then equivalent to sc - fde .",
    "therefore , v - ofdm naturally builds a bridge between ofdm and sc - fde in terms of both isi level and receiver complexity @xcite , and it has attracted recent interests . for v - ofdm ,",
    "an adaptive vector channel allocation scheme was proposed for v - ofdm systems @xcite .",
    "some key techniques , such as carrier / sampling - frequency synchronization and guard - band configuration in v - ofdm system were designed and made comparisons with the conventional ofdm systems @xcite .",
    "iterative demodulation and decoding under turbo principle is an efficient way for v - ofdm receiver @xcite .",
    "constellation - rotated v - ofdm was proposed with improved multipath diversity @xcite .",
    "linear receivers and the corresponding diversity order analyses are recently given in @xcite and phase noise influence is investigate in @xcite .",
    "for a very broadband channel , the ifft size of an ofdm system needs to be very large , which may cause practical implementation problems , such as high papr and high complexity .",
    "in contrast , for a v - ofdm , its ifft size can be fixed and independent of a bandwidth , while its vector size can be increased to accommodate the increased bandwidth . in this paper , we are interested in v - ofdm over a broadband sparse channel in the sense that it has a large time delay spread but only a few of nonzero taps @xcite . for sparse channels ,",
    "there have been many studies in the literature , see for example @xcite .",
    "recently , sparse fft ( sfft ) theory was proposed by the computer science & artificial intelligence lab , massachusetts institute of technology @xcite .",
    "if a signal has a small number @xmath2 of nonzero fourier coefficients , the output of the fourier transform can be represented succinctly using only @xmath2 coefficients . for such signals ,",
    "the runtime is sublinear in the signal size @xmath3 rather than @xmath4 .",
    "furthermore , several new algorithms for sfft are presented , i.e. , an @xmath5-time algorithm for the exactly @xmath2-sparse case , an @xmath6-time algorithm for the general case @xcite . in this paper , a sparse channel estimation and decoding scheme for v - ofdm systems is proposed .",
    "inspired by the idea of sfft under the condition of signals with only a few nonzero fourier coefficients , we first use pilot symbols to obtain channel frequency response ( cfr ) , and then estimate channel impulse response ( cir ) by using sparse ifft ( sifft ) .",
    "based on the estimation of nonzero channel coefficients and their corresponding coordinates , an efficient partial intersection sphere ( pis ) decoding is investigated and it achieves the same diversity order as the maximum likelihood ( ml ) decoding .",
    "the main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows .    * we find a connection between the exactly and approximately sparse channel models in the estimation of a v - ofdm sparse multipath channel . for a multipath channel with only a few nonzero taps ,",
    "if there is no noise during the transmission , then the sparse channel can be estimated by the exactly sparse multipath channel algorithm that corresponds to algorithm 3.1 for exactly sparse fft in @xcite .",
    "when there is additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) during the transmission , the sparse multipath channel can be estimated by the approximately sparse multipath channel algorithm that corresponds to algorithms 4.1@xmath74.2 for generally sparse fft in @xcite .",
    "* by using the sifft - based algorithms , one can directly recover the nonzero channel coefficients and their corresponding coordinates , which is significant to the pis decoding process .",
    "* for the pis decoding in v - ofdm systems , the bit error rate ( ber ) is dependent of @xmath8 nonzero taps in a sparse channel and the vector size @xmath9 to some extent , but roughly independent of the maximum delay @xmath10 .",
    "* for any given small sphere radius , the proposed pis decoding and ml decoding are of the same diversity order , which is equal to the cardinality of the set of reminder coordinates after mod @xmath9 , but the pis decoding can substantially reduce the computational complexity with probability @xmath0 .",
