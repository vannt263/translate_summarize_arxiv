    "mott mechanism of localization@xcite is an emergent phenomenon in which a large local coulomb repulsion suppresses double occupation , which prevents charge transport in a half - filled system .",
    "strongly correlated electron materials , such as transition metal oxides @xcite and some organic salts,@xcite exhibit a mott metal - insulator transition due to the effectively strong coulomb repulsion that exists between electrons occupying a narrow valence band . below the critical temperature @xmath0 ,",
    "this transition is of first - order and one observes a region where metal and insulator coexist.@xcite    the presence of disorder also leads to localization of electron wave functions , a phenomenon known as anderson localization.@xcite in this case the energetic mismatch between neighboring sites prevents charge transport in the lattice .",
    "these two mechanisms of localization - mott and anderson - combine in nontrivial ways , sometimes reducing , sometimes enhancing each other s effects .",
    "recently , the interplay between interaction and disorder has received much attention , mainly through three different perspectives .",
    "first , due to the investigation of the many - body localization,@xcite a novel paradigm arose for understanding localization in disordered and interacting quantum systems at non - zero temperature .",
    "second , very recently , models of disordered and interacting systems have been simulated with cold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite finally , the disorder and the effective interaction strength can be systematically tuned by doping,@xcite or even x - ray irradiation.@xcite    over the last few decades considerable progress in the description of strongly correlated materials and mott metal - insulator transition ( mit ) has been achieved through dynamical mean field theory ( dmft).@xcite in this method , a lattice model of interacting electrons is mapped to the anderson impurity model with a conduction bath which needs to be calculated self - consistently . to describe disorder ,",
    "the simplest treatment is within the coherent potential approximation ( cpa).@xcite the cpa can be easily combined with the dmft,@xcite by considering an ensemble of impurities surrounded by an average bath , which is the same for each electron .",
    "this approach thus does not describe the spatial fluctuations associated with the anderson localization .",
    "near the anderson transition the distribution of the local density of states ( dos ) changes from gaussian to log - normal,@xcite implying that its arithmetic average value does not provide a proper description of the system . the typical medium theory ( tmt)@xcite provides a simple method which is able to effectively describe the anderson localization .",
    "the central quantity in tmt is the typical density of states , defined as the geometric average of the local dos , @xcite which plays the role of the order parameter for the anderson localization .",
    "the tmt method was carefully tested for the noninteracting system,@xcite and it was successfully applied to the interacting case within the tmt - dmft approach,@xcite elucidating the full nonmagnetic phase diagram for the disordered half - filled hubbard model and the precise nature of the mott - anderson critical point.@xcite the tmt - dmft approach also allows for a spin - dependence analysis of the dos , which enables one to include effects of long - range magnetic order in disordered and interacting systems.@xcite    in this paper , we perform the first tmt - dmft calculation at finite temperatures . we explore the entire nonmagnetic phase diagram with a particular focus on the effects of disorder on the mott metal - insulator coexistence region .",
    "we carefully compare the tmt - dmft and cpa - dmft results with the goal of precisely determining the anderson localization effects , described only within the former method .",
    "we find that the tmt - dmft coexistence region is at comparatively lower values of the interaction @xmath1 , while the critical temperature @xmath0 is higher than in cpa - dmft .",
    "the width of the coexistence region , however , quickly decreases with disorder . at disorder strength @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bandwidth in the clean noninteracting system ,",
    "tmt - dmft predicts @xmath0 to abruptly go to zero , as opposed to the cpa - dmft solution where the coexistence region asymptotically shrinks to a single point as disorder is increased to infinity .",

    "we study the half - filled particle - hole symmetric lattice by setting the chemical potential @xmath18 equal to @xmath19 . in general , transition metal oxides and organic salts described by the hubbard model can exhibit both antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic mott insulating phases . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the paramagnetic solution which is present even at zero temperature in frustrated lattices .    within tmt - dmft",
    ", the lattice model describing a disordered correlated system is mapped onto an ensemble of single - impurity problems , corresponding to sites with different values of the on - site energy , each being embedded in a typical effective medium that needs to be calculated self - consistently .",
    "the tmt - dmft self - consistent procedure can be summarized as follows:@xcite by considering an initial guess for the ( typical ) bath @xmath20 surrounding the impurities , we solve an ensemble of impurity problems , which give us local green s functions @xmath21 from which local spectra @xmath22 are obtained .",

    "the metallic phase , on the other hand , features a quasi - particle peak in the typical dos , nonzero integrated dos @xmath30 , and a variable site occupation @xmath34 .",
    "finally , the correlated anderson insulator shows a vanishing typical dos , indicating that all the states are localized and as such do not contribute with spectral weight to the typical dos.@xcite for this reason , the frequency integrated typical dos goes to zero when the system approaches the anderson insulator , and thus can be used as an order parameter that signalizes this transition .",
    "furthermore , within the tmt - dmft the anderson insulating phase corresponds to a two - fluid phase:@xcite it consists of empty and doubly occupied sites , characteristic of non - interacting anderson insulators , as well as singly occupied sites , characterizing mott localized states ( see the results for @xmath35 in panel b ) .",
    "we find good agreement between our diagram and others known in the literature at @xmath36.@xcite the most relevant effects of finite , but small temperature are over the mott coexistence region , which spans over a smaller range of @xmath1 in comparison with the @xmath36 case .",
    "the real axis ipt impurity solver makes it possible to solve tmt - dmft equations for a broad range of parameters and several temperatures . in the following , we concentrate on the range of parameters near the phase transition , and , in particular , near the coexistence region of metallic and insulating solutions",
    "in this section we analyze the coexistence region for weak and moderate disorder , which corresponds to @xmath38 , @xmath39 . at this regime ,",
    "the critical @xmath1 for the mott transition is greater than the disorder strength . although the phase transition described within tmt - dmft is qualitatively similar as that of cpa - dmft , some anderson localization effects are already observed .      to obtain the coexistence region within cpa - dmft or tmt - dmft , for a fixed temperature @xmath40",

    "although of the mott type , the hubbard subbands are strongly reduced for this value of @xmath16 , as can be seen in the dos presented in the inset , which is consistent with our expectation that both mott and anderson routes to localization are relevant in this regime of @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , our analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] suggests that for @xmath81 there exists a transition between a metal and a mott insulator in the _ absence _ of a coexistence region .",
