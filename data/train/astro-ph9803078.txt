    "given the current paradigm of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the observed huge luminosities of agns are powered by gravitational accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( e.g. , rees 1984 ; blandford 1990 ; antonucci 1993 ; peterson 1997 ) .",
    "the central engines are considered to be surrounded by dusty tori whose typical inner radii are on the order of @xmath0 1 pc ( e.g. , antonucci , miller 1985 ; pier , krolik 1992 , 1993 ) .",
    "therefore , in order to understand agns , it is very important to investigate the spatial structures of the inner @xmath0 1 pc regions in which a supermassive black hole , an accretion disk , warm absorbers , and broad emission - line regions ( blrs ) reside .",
    "the innermost constituent is the accretion disk ; its typical radius is @xmath0 ( 10  100 ) @xmath1  @xmath2 pc where @xmath3 is the schwarzschild radius of a black hole and @xmath4 is the black - hole mass in units of @xmath5 .",
    "the existence of accretion disks in agns has been demonstrated by the recent x - ray spectroscopy , collected using _",
    "( tanaka et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "x - ray spectra of type-1 agns show the presence of very broad fe k@xmath6 emission , whose line profile can be fitted well by some accretion - disk models ( tanaka et al .",
    "1995 ; fabian et al . 1995 ; mushotzky et al . 1995 ; iwasawa et al . 1996 ; nandra et al . 1997 ; reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "an ionized accretion disk has also been detected by the recent radio continuum mapping in the archetypical , nearby seyfert galaxy ngc 1068 ( gallimore et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "another inner constituent is broad - line regions ( blrs ) , because their typical radii are of on the order of 0.01 pc ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "one of the most important questions related to the blrs is how emission - line clouds are distributed around agns .",
    "although there is still no definite consensus concerning the dynamical and spatial structure of blrs , there are three alternative models : 1 ) the disk model ( shields 1979 ; see also osterbrock 1989 ) , 2 ) the high - velocity streamer model ( zheng et al .",
    "1991 ) , and 3 ) a pair of conical regions in which photoionized clouds are orbiting randomly with keplerian motion ( wanders et al . 1995 ; wanders , peterson 1996 , 1997 ; goad , wanders 1996 ) .",
    "in particular , a recent detailed analysis of the reverberation mapping has strongly suggested that the blrs of the type-1 seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 has the third type of geometry ( wanders et al .",
    "it is , however , still not known which model is the most popular one .    since recent observations have shown that the blrs are dominated by rotational motion , rather than the radial motion ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ; wanders et al .",
    "1995 ) , it is interesting to examine whether or not the rotational axis of the blr is nearly the same as that of the accretion disk . if the disk model for blrs would be correct , the blrs may be coplanar with respect to the accretion disk .",
    "in fact , double - peaked blrs have sometimes been considered to arise from accretion disks , themselves [ e.g. , prez et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ; livio , xu ( 1997 ) and references therein ; see also , however , gaskell ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "motivated by this , we investigate the relationship between the inclination angle of the accretion disk and the width of blr statistically using published data .",
    "nandra et al . ( 1997 ) presented a systematic analysis of the _ asca _ x - ray spectra of 18 type-1 seyfert galaxies .",
    "they fitted the fe k@xmath6 emission profiles and derived the most probable inclination angles for the following three models : model a , the schwarzschild model with reflection ; model b , the schwarzschild model with the emissivity law for @xmath7 ( see below ) ; and model c , the kerr model with reflection , where the schwarzschild and kerr models refer to those proposed by fabian et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and laor ( 1991 ) , respectively . in their model - fitting procedures",
    ", there are five parameters : 1 ) the inner radius of the disk ( @xmath8 ) , the outer radius ( @xmath9 ) , the inclination of the axis of rotation with respect to the line of sight ( @xmath10 ) , the rest energy of fe k@xmath6 line ( @xmath11 ) , and the line normalization ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "they adopted @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 kev for models a and b , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 for model c. in addition to the above parameters , the line emissivity is also another parameter , which is usually parameterized by a power law as a function of the radius ; i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "model b is the case for _ q _ = 2.5 , which is an averaged value for the case of free line emissivity [ see table 4 and figure 6 in nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ] .",
    "the inclination angles for the three models are summarized in table 1 .",
    "note that some seyfert nuclei were observed by",
    "more than once ( e.g. , ngc 4151 ) . in these cases , we tabulated the estimated inclination angles for all of the observations .",
    "we have compiled the line widths of both h@xmath6 and h@xmath19 emission , fwzi ( full width at zero intensity ) , for the above 18 seyfert galaxies based on the literature .",
    "since it is known that the blr emission generally shows time variations ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) , it would be desirable to obtain the data of both blr and fe k@xmath6 emission simultaneously .",
    "however , all of the blr data were taken far before the x - ray observations . in order to minimize any possible effect of time variations , we compiled more than - one measurements for each galaxy as much as possible , and then used the averaged value in a later analysis .",
    "for some seyferts , fwhms ( full width at half maxima ) of the emission lines are only available in the literature . in these cases , we estimated fwzis using a relation fwzi = @xmath20 fwhm ( wandel , yahil 1985 ) .",
    "the compiled data are summarized in table 2 .",
    "in figure . 1 , we compare sin @xmath10 with fwzi(h@xmath6)/ @xmath21 ( _ left column _ ) and with fwzi(h@xmath19)/ @xmath21 ( _ right column _ ) for the three accretion - disk models a , b , and c , where @xmath22 is the x - ray ( 2  10 kev ) luminosity . in these comparisons ,",
    "we used both fwzi(h@xmath6)/@xmath21 and fwzi(h@xmath19)/@xmath21 , instead of their raw fwzi values .",
    "the reason for this is that the velocity width of blrs depends on the central mass , even if the inner radius of the blrs would be the same among the seyferts , while the inclination angle of an accretion disk has no dependence on the black - hole mass .",
    "if the eddington ratios are not very different among the seyferts ( i.e. , the mass - to - luminosity ratios are nearly the same among the seyferts ) , we expect the relationship fwzi @xmath23 , which is analogous to the so - called faber - jackson relation ( faber , jackson 1976 ) .",
    "we adopted the x - ray luminosities given by nandra et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows that _ all of the correlations are negative_. as shown in table 3 , the correlation coefficients suggest that the negative correlations are not significant statistically .",
    "therefore , our modest conclusion may be that there is a slight correlation between @xmath24 with fwzi(h@xmath6)/@xmath21 , suggesting a random orientation between the blrs and the accretion disks .",
    "however , it is quite unlikely that the large errors in the estimate of @xmath10 cause any accidental negative correlations for all of the cases shown in figure 1 .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that there is a tendency of a negative correlation between @xmath24 with fwzi(h@xmath6)/@xmath21 .",
    "more interestingly , we mention that there is no hint of a positive correlation between them .",
    "the most important result in this study is that there is no obvious _ positive _ correlation between @xmath24 with fwzi(h@xmath6)/ @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests that _ the blrs are not coplanar with respect to accretian disks_.    some seyfert nuclei in our sample show double - peaked blrs ( dblrs ) .",
    "it has sometimes been considered that such dblrs may arise from an accretion disk , itself ( e.g. , prez et al .",
    "the dblr emission profiles of the four seyfert nuclei in our sample ( ngc 3227 , ngc 3783 , ngc 5548 , and 3c 120 ) were studied by rokaki et al .",
    "( 1992 ) using a standard geometrically - thin accretion- disk model ; also , the inclination angles of the dblrs ( @xmath25 ) were derived .",
    "we compare these inclination angles with those of the accretion disks in figure 2 .",
    "this comparison also suggests a negative correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath25 , being consistent with our result .",
    "this strengthens our suggestion that the blrs are not coplanar with respect to the accretion disks in the seyfert nuclei studied here .",
    "let us consider what kind of geometrical configuration can explain the non - coplanar property .",
    "the negative correlation means that the normalized velocity width increases with decreasing inclination angle ; i.e. , _ seyfert nuclei with a more face - on accretion disk tend to have larger blr velocity widths_. there may be three alternative ideas to explain this property .",
    "one is the bipolar streamer model ( e.g. , zheng et al . 1990 ) .",
    "if we observe the accretion disk from a face - on view , the velocity width would be widest because the bipolar wind flows along our line of sight .",
    "however , this model has an intrinsic difficulty , as claimed by livio and xu ( 1996 ) , because the emitting region on the receding flow ( jet ) is obscured from view by the accretion disk ; the standard , optically thick accretion disk is opaque up to @xmath0 1 pc , and , thus , the blr component behind the disk can not be seen , because the typical radial distance of blrs from the central engine is on the order of 0.01 pc ( e.g. , peterson 1993 ) .",
    "the second idea is that blrs are located in nearly the same plane as that of an accretion disk , but are orbiting with poloar orbits .",
    "if a two - sided jet is ejected with a highly inclined angle with respect to the _ global _ accretion disk , we can explain the negative correlation .",
    "such a jet model is briefly described by norman and miley ( 1984 ) .",
    "this idea is consistent with the recent reverberation mapping result for the blrs of ngc 5548 because the most likely geometry of the blrs of this galaxy is a pair of conical regions in which photoionized clouds are orbiting randomly with keplerian motion ( wanders et al .",
    "1995 ; wanders , peterson 1996 , 1997 ; see also goad , wanders 1996 ) .",
    "this model may also have the same obscuration problem as that for the above streamer model .",
    "however , if the blr clouds are moving at randomly oriented orbits ( wanders et al .",
    "1995 ) , there may be no obscuration problem .",
    "the third idea is that blrs arise from outer parts of a warped accretion disk .",
    "the disk model for blr is the standard idea ( shields 1977 ; see also for a review osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "it has been recently shown that accreting gas clouds probed by water - vapor maser emission at 22 ghz show evidence of significant warping ( miyoshi et al . 1995 ; begelman , bland - hawthorn 1997 ) .",
    "the warping of accretion disks can be driven by the effect of the radiation - pressure force ( pringle 1996 , 1997 ) . for typical agn ,",
    "the warping may occur at _",
    "@xmath26 0.01 pc ( pringle 1997 ) , which is at a similar distance as blrs .",
    "therefore , the warped - disk model can explain the observed negative correlation reasonably well .",
    "this model is schematically shown in figure 3 .",
    "since the degree of warping and the viewing angle are different from agn to agn , the negative correlation between @xmath10 and @xmath25 may be blurred as obtained in our analysis , although the poor correlation may be also due to the large errors in the estimate of @xmath10 .",
