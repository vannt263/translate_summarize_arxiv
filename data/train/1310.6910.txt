    "materials with a high spin polarization at the fermi edge are promising for spintronic devices.@xcite heusler , which have been predicted to be half - metallic ferromagnets , are currently considered as potentially interesting materials for this purpose.@xcite heusler compounds have a distinctive stoichiometry and crystallize in the l2@xmath6-structure x@xmath2yz , where x and y are transition metals and z is a main group element . among the heusler compounds ,",
    "co@xmath0fesi  has shown the highest magnetization of 6@xmath7 per formula unit,@xcite in agreement with the slater - pauling rule @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of valence electrons.@xcite moreover , co@xmath0fesi  is the heusler compound with the highest curie temperature .",
    "therefore , co@xmath0fesi  might be an ideal material for spintronics applications , provided that the prediction of half - metallic ferromagnetic properties is correct , as was indeed recently suggested by ref ..    however , co@xmath2fesi is predicted to be a half - metallic compound only if electron correlations are considered in the form of the on - site repulsion energy _",
    "u_. neglecting the electron correlations , co@xmath0fesi  is predicted to be a conventional ferromagnet.@xcite hence , a reliable probe of half - metallic ferromagnetism in co@xmath0fesi  is still needed .",
    "the calculations reported in ref . show a significant change in the x - ray magnetic linear dichroism ( xmld ) spectra if electron correlation effects are considered .",
    "thus , xmld may serve as a crucial test for band structure calculation schemes as the xmld , in a single - particle picture , is roughly speaking proportional to the first derivative of the minority density - of - states function ( pdos ) in contrast to the x - ray magnetic circular dichroism being directly proportional to the dos.@xcite meinert _ _ et al.__@xcite already investigated xmld for co@xmath0fesi  and compared it to a variety of density functional theory - based calculations . although the comparison , shown in ref . , rules out some band structure models , qualitative differences between experiment and theoretical predictions still remained .    in this article , we present xmld spectra measured on a series of co@xmath0fesi  film samples with systematically varied atomic order .",
    "the increase of atomic order results in an increase of magnetization , which suggests a concomitant transition from metallic to half - metallic ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "thus , according to theoretical calculations , a considerable altering of the spectra is expected . to address the relation between the measured xmld spectra and the underlying electronic structure , we employed various exchange - correlation functionals , used a few different values of the hubbard @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) parameter and performed a number of calculations using the so - called non - selfconsistent fixed spin moment technique .",
    "although the overall spectrum is well given , the fine structure appearing predominantly at the @xmath12 edge is not sufficiently captured .",
    "epitaxial ( 001)-oriented co@xmath0fesi  films were grown by dc magnetron sputtering onto mgo(001 ) substrates in a uhv system with a base pressure of 110@xmath13@xmath14 mbar .",
    "the distance between the film and the stoichiometric target of co@xmath0fesi  was 10 cm , while the ar working pressure was 7.7710@xmath15@xmath14 mbar .",
    "different degrees of local atomic order in the films were achieved by setting different substrate temperatures at each film deposition in the range of 470@xmath16c to 730@xmath16c .",
    "the substrate temperature was determined with a pyrometer set to an emissivity of 0.31 . to prevent oxidation the films",
    "were capped immediately after deposition with a 3 nm thick capping layer grown at room temperature .",
    "we used both al and cr as a capping layer .",
    "the saturation magnetization of each film was determined with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms - xl-5 ) at 20k and 300k with magnetic fields up to 3 t .",
    "thickness determination and structural characterization were performed by x - ray reflection / diffraction with a phillips xpert diffractometer .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) were recorded at the synchrotron light source bessy ii ( beamline ue56/1-sgm ) .",
    "the samples were mounted perpendicular to the beam and were magnetically saturated by an external field parallel to the film surface .",
    "the degree of linear polarization of the synchrotron radiation was close to 100% .",
    "all measurements were performed at room temperature with the total - electron - yield ( tey ) technique where the specimen current is measured .",
    "the photon intensity was measured by a gold mesh .",
    "the polarization of the photon beam was switched between linear vertical and linear horizontal while the magnetic field was kept constant .",
    "the linear dichroism is calculated as the difference between spectra measured with horizontal and vertical polarization .",
    "the nmr experiments were performed in an automated , coherent , phase sensitive and frequency tuned spin - echo spectrometer provided by nmr service erfurt , germany .",
    "the nmr spectra were recorded at a temperature of 5k and in the frequency range of 120 - 200mhz with steps of 0.5mhz .",
    "no external magnetic field was applied during the measurements .",
    "all nmr spectra were corrected for the magnetic enhancement factor as well as the @xmath17 dependence , resulting in relative spin - echo intensities , which are proportional to the number of nuclei with a given nmr resonance frequency .",
    "the procedure of the enhancement correction is described in refs . and .",
    "the electronic structure of the co@xmath0fesi  was calculated with the wien2k code@xcite in the density - functional theory ( dft ) framework , employing the local spin density approximation@xcite and the general gradient appoximation ( gga ) , the latter as parameterized by perdew - burke - ernzerhof@xcite for the exchange - correlation term .",

    ", gga+__u _ _ ) in the self - interaction corrected formulation.@xcite calculations on the basis of the conventional usual local spin density approximation or the gga alone , i.e. without additional hubbard _ u _ , do not give a correct magnetic moment for co@xmath2fesi as was already pointed out before by several authors ( see refs . and and references therein ) .",
    "all calculations presented here were done for the lattice parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the core electrons were treated fully relativistically ( dirac equations ) and for the semicore and valence states the spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) was included through a variational scheme.@xcite the convergence of the electronic structure calculations was ensured by the following parameters : the convergence criterion of the total energy was better than @xmath19 ry / atom ; the energy cutoff given as the product of the muffin - tin radius and the maximum reciprocal space vector @xmath20 was 8.5 , the largest reciprocal vector in the charge fourier expansion , @xmath21 , was set to 12ry@xmath22 , the maximum angular momentum value of partial waves inside the muffin - tin spheres @xmath23 was 10 , and a grid of 20@xmath2420@xmath2420 @xmath25-points was applied to sample the 1@xmath26 brillouin zone .",
    "the same @xmath25-point mesh was used to determine dipolar squared momentum matrix elements , which occur in the kubo formula for the permittivity tensor . to account for lifetime effects a broadening with a lorentzian with a width of 0.3ev",
    "was applied for the x - ray spectra from core ( localized ) to unoccupied states ( delocalized states ) .",
    "the core level exchange splitting was also included.@xcite the kramers - kronig transformations were performed and the complex values of permittivity tensor elements @xmath27 were obtained .",
    "subsequently , permittivity elements served as input for our in - house optical code solving fresnel equations using 4-vector yeh s formalism as extended for magnetic multilayers.@xcite we hence obtain the reflectivity and transmittivity matrices ( @xmath28 ) for each magnetization direction * m*. the absorbance @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is absorptance , @xmath32 denotes scatter and @xmath33 reflection of the material .",

    "finally , the linear dichroism is computed here as xmld = @xmath45 .",
    "note , that this holds only for normal incidence .",
    "the normalization factor used was @xmath46 .",
    "the long range order of the atomic structure of the films was determined with 4-circle x - ray diffraction .",
    "the obtained lattice constant of the films is 5.64 @xmath47 0.01 , in agreement with previous measurements of co@xmath0fesi  thin films as well as bulk material.@xcite the rocking curves reveal widths @xmath48 between 0.29@xmath16 and 0.73@xmath16 . to determine the l2@xmath6 structure within the sample series , it is not sufficient to compare the maximum intensities of the ( 202 ) - and ( 111 ) - film reflections .",
    "rather the ratio of the integrated peak areas of @xmath49 - scans @xmath50 provides a better estimation of the real intensity ratios .",
    "we measured the rocking curves of the ( 202 ) - and ( 111 ) - reflections , which were fitted with gaussian functions to determine the enclosed areas of the reflections .",
    "we compare our values with results calculated for powder diffraction corrected with the geometry factor according to bragg brenato and multiplicity .",
    "the ratio of the individual reflections is given by the program _ powdercell _ as @xmath51 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we see an increase of the saturation magnetization with higher substrate temperatures , except for cfs(cr2 ) , which exhibits the lowest value . in the al - capped series we find the same for cfs(al3 ) . in general a systematic dependency for all values on the substrate temperature is observed .",
    "the absorption intensity is measured for the electric field vector of the linearly polarized beam parallel @xmath52 and perpendicular @xmath53 to the magnetization vector .",

    "this is typical for the heusler structure and was already observed for different heusler compounds ( refs . ) .",
    "an analogous shoulder is visible for the co edge at the energy 798.1ev above the @xmath56 peak , which is smaller due to lifetime broadening effects.@xcite    the complete set of xmld spectra for each film is presented in fig.[fig : overview100 ] ( for the case of @xmath57 @xmath36 [ 100 ] ) and fig.[fig : overview110 ] ( for the case of @xmath57 @xmath36 [ 110 ] ) . for direct comparison , the xmld spectra for cr- and al - capped films are displayed on the left- and right - hand side , respectively .",
    "the spectra measured at the co @xmath5-edge are presented in the top panels and those measured at fe @xmath5-edge in the bottom panels .",
    "the structure of the xmld spectra clearly exhibits more features at the @xmath1 edge than the xmcd spectra of co@xmath0fesi , which was already predicted by ref . and",
    "reported in ref .. the spectra measured for the co@xmath0fesi(cr4 ) film with the deposition temperature of 730@xmath16c ( fig.[fig : xasandxmld ] and fig.[fig : overview100]a , e ) agree in all details of the spectra with the spectra reported in ref .. the largest xmld signal is observed for the co@xmath0fesi(cr ) film with the highest magnetization ( 5.8@xmath7/f.u . ) .",
    "maximum xmld values of 4.1% at the fe @xmath12 edge for @xmath57 @xmath36 [ 100 ] ( fig.[fig : overview100]e ) and 3.4% at the co @xmath12 edge for @xmath57 @xmath36 [ 110 ] ( fig.[fig : overview110]e ) are obtained .      due to the surface sensitivity of the tey method different interface properties for different capping materials can be detected .",
    "the information depth of tey is given by the mean free path of the emitted secondary electrons and typically amounts to 2.5nm.@xcite we compare two series of samples prepared with identical conditions except for the different capping materials al and cr .",
    "both capping materials do not contribute to the absorption spectra in the investigated energy range .",
    "thus , we anticipated no change in the measured xmld spectra of the films with different capping layers .",
    "contrarily , the two sets of spectra show pronounced differences , as discussed in the following .",
    "the xmld spectra of the co@xmath0fesi(cr ) films ( see left column of fig.[fig : overview100 ] and fig.[fig : overview110 ] ) show similar features within the film series at a given field and beam geometry .",
    "in contrast , the xmld spectra of al - capped films ( see right column of fig.[fig : overview100 ] and fig.[fig : overview110 ] ) show pronounced variations for different samples .",
    "the most striking differences between cr- and al - capped films are observed for @xmath57 @xmath36 [ 100 ] at the co edge ( fig.[fig : overview100]a and fig.[fig : overview100]m ) . for the co@xmath0fesi(cr )",
    "series at the @xmath12 edge , we note a sharp minimum ( a ) followed by a sharp maximum ( b ) . for the co@xmath0fesi(al ) samples , instead , the xmld spectra starts with a maximum ( a ) followed by the minimum a ( fig.[fig : overview100]m , n ) .",
    "samples with lower magnetization ( fig.[fig : overview100]o , p ) show a minor ( a ) but do not show a positive maximum ( b ) .",
    "we assume that the al atoms interdiffuse into the film . to support our assumption we recorded xmld spectra ( fig.[fig : cfsaaverage ] ) of a co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  film , which was deposited at 700@xmath16c and",
    "capped with a 3 nm al layer .",
    "co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  was chosen to mimic a co@xmath0fesi  film with an interdiffusion of al atoms in the subsurface for the surface - sensitive tey method .",
    "the spectra reveal the same features as for the al - capped co@xmath0fesi  films for both fe and co and directions [ 100 ] and [ 110 ] .        especially at co and for direction",
    "[ 100 ] we see that a maximum a@xmath58 is followed by a minimum a , like discussed before . given the similarity of the xmld spectra of the co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  film and the co@xmath0fesi(al ) series , we assume that during the deposition of the capping layer , al atoms interdiffuse into the co@xmath0fesi  film . even though we grew each capping layer at room temperature , our results suggest intermixing , also being partially due to resputtering of the co@xmath0fesi  atoms with the result of al atoms being implanted into the first atomic layers . as a consequence ,",
    "the subsurface of the prepared co@xmath0fesi(al ) films is similar to co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "since the tey method is surface sensitive , the measured xmld on the co@xmath0fesi(al ) films resemble the xmld spectra of the co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  film .",
    "the interdiffusion of the al atoms manifests in each xmld spectra differently with respect to the orientation ( i.e.  the excitation geometry which the sample was measured in ) . additionally , the probed element ( co , fe ) plays a role , as the influence of the al atoms in the upper layer can be clearly observed at the co edge , whereas the capping has hardly any influence on the xlmd spectra of fe edge .",
    "this is easily understood by taking into account the following argument : the al capping atoms intermix with si atoms .",
    "this interdiffusion changes the first nearest neighboring shell of co atoms and only the second nearest neighbor shell of fe .",
    "the non systematic variation can be explained by unknown temperatures of the sample during the deposition of the capping layer .",
    "this took place a temperatures between room temperature and 50@xmath16c , where we did not expect any interdiffusion and therefore did not monitor exact temperatures and waiting times .",
    "thus different degrees of intermixing of al atoms with the film occur . in general",
    "it is possible to show interdiffusion via neutron reflectivity measurements of multilayer sample ( see ref . ) .",
    "however , to show interdiffusion on a single layer is much more demanding due to the small sample volume and the unknown partial oxidation of the capping layer .",
    "as mentioned above , we encounter no large variations for the cr - capped films .",
    "hence , we conclude that cr does not interdiffuse with the co@xmath0fesi  film . a non continuous capping layer would result in a partially oxidized film , which clearly would change the xmld spectra .",
    "we can exclude this as we already showed xmcd spectra of samples without oxidation in ref . that were capped with the same material and procedure .",
    "the xmld is expected to increase with the square of the magnetization of the sample . to investigate this dependence systematically ,",
    "the intensity differences of the marked maxima and minima ( a , b , c , d , e , and f ) were taken as a scale for the xmld strength .",
    "the respective xmld values were plotted versus the corresponding saturation magnetization of the film ( fig.[fig : overview100]i , j , k , l and fig.[fig : overview110]i , j , k , l ) .",
    "the co[100]-plot ( fig.[fig : overview100]i ) of the cr - capped series exhibits an increase of b - c and e - f .",
    "the value of a - b of the film with m@xmath59 = 5.37@xmath7/f.u . does not match the general trend of an increase , even though the other samples depict an increase .",
    "c - d shows stronger xmld values with rising saturation magnetization , except the last datapoint of c - d , which is slightly lower than the film with with m@xmath59 = 5.37@xmath7/f.u .. however , a trend of increasing xmld signal is visible , whereas at the co[100]-plot for the al - capped series ( fig.[fig : overview100]j ) , no such dependence can be observed . for the fe[100]-plot with the cr - capped series ( fig.[fig : overview100]k ) , the film with the lowest and the highest saturation magnetization have the smallest , respectively the highest xmld values as expected .",
    "however , the film with 5.37@xmath7/f.u . shows smaller values than the film with 4.89@xmath7/f.u .. the same can be observed for co [ 110 ] ( fig.[fig : overview110]i ) .",
    "the al - capped series of the fe[100]-plot ( fig.[fig : overview100]l ) and co[110]-plot ( fig.[fig : overview110]j ) do show very similar values for the xmld and thus again show no dependence on the saturation magnetization .",
    "for the cr - capped series at the fe[110]-plot ( fig.[fig : overview110]k ) , the value for a - b and c - d increases with the saturation magnetization .",
    "for the al - capped series ( fig.[fig : overview110]l ) , it is found that the film with the lowest saturation magnetization of 4.98@xmath7/f.u . has the strongest xmld features .",
    "even the film with 6.10@xmath7/f.u .",
    "does not exceed these values .",
    "generally , comparing the xmld spectra of the cr- and al - capped films , higher values for the cr - capped film series were observed .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) probes all the @xmath60co nuclei in the film samples due to a rather large penetration depth of the radio frequency wave ( typically on the order of @xmath34 m ) .",
    "the surface effects seen in xmld , namely the formation of a few monolayers of co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4 at the co@xmath0fesi / al interface , are not observable by nmr due to a lack of sensitivity , as the signal was optimized to reveal the nmr signals stemming from the bulk of the films .",
    "note that the nmr spectra of co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  ( at about 160  mhz ) may be hidden in the broad signal .",
    "nmr allows to investigate the local environments of @xmath60co nuclei in the bulk of the film samples , and enables to determine the degree of order as well as possible existence of off - stoichiometry.@xcite    the @xmath60co nmr spectra measured on all samples ( representatives are shown in fig.[fig : nmr1 ] ) have a main line at around 145  mhz with one satellite on the high - frequency side .",
    "a similar @xmath60co nmr spectrum with high - frequency satellites was reported for off - stoichiometric co@xmath2fesi films ( ref . ) . in the present case ,",
    "the average linewidths ( 7.99  mhz ) are smaller than those reported in the previous data ( 11.8  mhz , ref . ) , which already indicates a higher degree of order and smaller degree of off - stoichiometry in the present films .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the overall shift of the main line ( 145  mhz ) towards lower frequencies compared to previous nmr data on co@xmath0fesi  films ( 150mhz@xcite ) , the main line of the co@xmath2fesi films now shifting towards the single nmr line observed for highly - ordered bulk co@xmath2fesi ( 139  mhz @xcite ) .",
    "the intensity of the high - frequency satellite lines is lower compared to the satellite lines presented in ref . , indicating that the films investigated here are of much higher structural quality .",
    "the improved short range order of the l2@xmath6 structure visible in the nmr parameters correlates with the improved long range order seen in the x - ray investigations , i.e. an increased intensity of the ( 111 ) ordering peak .    to quantitatively analyze the spectra we fitted them using a sum of gaussian lines representing different numbers of fe and si next nearest neighbors in the first coordination shell of co ( compare ref . ) .",
    "the representative fit of the co@xmath0fesi(al1 ) sample is shown in fig.[fig : nmr2 ] .",
    "however , the fit matches much better to the data if a third broad line is included .",
    "interestingly , the resonance frequency of this broad line coincides with the one observed for the main line in co@xmath2fesi@xmath61al@xmath61.@xcite however , this line is observed for both types of capping layers , al and cr .",
    "this excludes the formation of co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4 as origin of the broad nmr line .",
    "we suggest the origin of the broad line to be strain within the film , induced by the substrate as explained in the following : the broad line has the same frequency and the same linewidth for all samples , the only difference is its relative contribution to the total spectrum , which slightly varies from sample to sample . the contribution of the broad line is stronger for thinner films , e.g.  in the case of the 45 nm cr - capped co@xmath0fesi  film the ratio between intensities of the broad line and the main line is @xmath62 , whereas in the case of the 75 nm thick cr - capped co@xmath0fesi  film it is @xmath63 .",
    "this finding suggests that this broad contribution is probably from the so called  dead layer \" near the substrate.@xcite it is well known that there is a substantial difference between lattice parameters of the mgo substrate ( 4.21@xmath64 = 5.95 ) and co@xmath0fesi  ( 5.64 ) , which may yield a monotonous change in the structure of the heusler film within a certain distance from the substrate .",
    "the factor @xmath65 is attributed to the rotation of the co@xmath0fesi  unit cell by 45@xmath66 with respect to the mgo unit cell .",
    "the bulk of the film sample has an ideal @xmath67 structure with a slight amount of fe - si off - stoichiometry , represented by the parameter @xmath68 in co@xmath2fe@xmath69si@xmath70 .",
    "the values of @xmath68 in percent are listed in table [ tab : samples ] .",
    "all @xmath68 values were calculated by fitting a binomial distribution function to the relative areas of the nmr resonance lines , as discussed in detail in ref ..",
    "fig.[fig : nmr ] summarizes the relations between the different film characteristics ( deposition temperature and saturation magnetization ) and the results of the nmr analysis ( linewidth , amount of off - stoichiometry and resonance frequency ) . for both types of capping layers , the amount of off - stoichiometry @xmath68 depends on the deposition temperature , specifically : the degree of off - stoichiometry decreases with increasing deposition temperature and hence with the degree of order ( fig.[fig : nmr](a , b ) ) . generally , the nmr linewidth is also a good measure of the structural order of a system .",
    "fig.[fig : nmr]c , d demonstrate a clear correlation between the magnetic moment of a given film and the nmr linewidth .",
    "samples prepared at higher deposition temperatures generally have a larger moment and smaller nmr linewidth , which is an indication of higher local order .",
    "in addition , there is a dependence of the resonance frequency of the main nmr line on the magnetic moment , samples with higher magnetic moment show a signal at lower frequencies , with the frequency closer to bulk co@xmath0fesi  ( 6@xmath7/f.u . ) .",
    "such a trend is typically seen for nmr lines of heusler compounds ( compare refs . and ) .",

    "please note that the first coordination shell of co in the @xmath67 type structure with the 2:1:1 stoichiometry consists of 4fe+4si atoms ; the resonance line at 145  mhz corresponds to @xmath60co nuclei with this specific local environment .",

    "calculation was performed according to ref .. notably , this value is about seven times larger than the value of 0.8% obtained by antoniak _",
    "et al_.@xcite as in the case of fe@xmath72si , we conclude from the positive asymmetry that the orientation of the si moment is antiparallel to the mean magnetization , which is in agreement with the prediction in ref .. assuming that the size of the asymmetry scales with the magnetic moment we obtain an induced magnetic moment of -0.07@xmath7 , which nicely agrees with our calculated value of si total magnetic moment of -0.06@xmath7 , ( @xmath76 ) . as we probe si _",

    "since we could not measure at the @xmath71-edge we can not conclude on the contribution from the orbital magnetic moment . because the atomic structure in our case is cubic we may assume that the orbital moment contribution will be an order of magnitude smaller than the spin moment .",
    "the calculation of adequate xmld spectra at the co and fe @xmath1 edges of the full heusler compound co@xmath2fesi is still a challenging task . using different exchange - correlation functionals , or employing additional parameters such as the hubbard @xmath10 ,",
    "varying electronic structures can be obtained , leading to magnetic moments different from 6@xmath7 as well as to different x - ray spectra .",
    "recently , the so - called fixed - spin method@xcite has been employed to constrain the magnetic moment of co@xmath2fesi to the maximum measured value of 6@xmath7 ; the electronic structure was then computed selfconsistently under this constraint.@xcite however , it seems that the low lying bands exhibit a non - physical exchange splitting of 1ev , see fig.6 of ref .",

    "recent electronic structure investigations have shown that the observed fine structure at the @xmath12 edges is often not exactly reproduced by _ ab initio _ calculations , whereas the @xmath56 edges often show just a simple oscillation and here the agreement with the first - principles calculations is good.@xcite the experimentally observed fine structure at at @xmath12 edge might stem from various , as yet unresolved origins .",
    "it might come from many - body effects or even be related to deficiencies of the sample.@xcite    as the lsda+@xmath10 approach has given the best agreement between experimental and computed data , we employ here this approach . in fig.[fig",

    "the calculations were performed with the lsda+__u _ _ technique , using @xmath11 = 4.8ev(co ) and @xmath11 = 4.5ev(fe ) . for details , see text . ]    certain differences between the experimental and calculated spectra can be noted . for magnetization",
    "parallel to [ 100 ] the calculated xmld spectrum at the co @xmath1 edge does not exhibit a fine structure in contrast to the measured spectra shown in fig.[fig : overview100 ] .",
    "the calculations lack the drop ( c ) and the drop ( d ) on the high - energy side at the @xmath12 edge . for the @xmath56 edge the calculated xmld spectrum exhibits a single oscillation with the same sign of the asymmetry of the two lobes as in the experiment , compare fig.[fig : cfs - ab initio ] and fig.[fig : overview100 ] . for magnetization",
    "parallel to [ 110 ] the xmld spectrum again exhibits a single oscillation at both the @xmath12 and @xmath56 edges as seen in the experiment having the correct asymmetry , _",
    "i.e. _ the positive peak is higher in magnitude than the negative peak .",
    "moreover , the sign of the co xmld is inverted under the change of the magnetization direction from [ 100 ] to [ 110 ] , in agreement with the previous study@xcite and with studies of the pure @xmath77 elements.@xcite this inversion of the xmld spectrum appears as a consequence of the crystal - field splitting of the @xmath78 and @xmath79 states of the respective transition metal atom , with different states being sensitively probed for different magnetization directions.@xcite we note that the xmld spectra of co in fig.4 of ref . obtained with the lsda+__u _ _ differ from ours by more fine structures at the @xmath12 and @xmath56 edges for both magnetization directions .",
    "however , it seems that we can reproduce such fine structures with calculations using the generalized gradient approximation with the hubbard _ u _ technique ( gga+__u _ _ ) instead of lsda+__u _ _ , but for the very similar value of @xmath80ev for the co atom .",
    "the calculated fe xmld spectrum has a three peak structure at the @xmath12 edge , whereas a single oscillation at the @xmath56 edge exists for both magnetization directions , which again are inverted when changing the magnetization orientation from [ 100 ] to [ 110 ] .",
    "the experimental spectra at the @xmath12 edge exhibit similar features for magnetization along [ 100 ] , except for peak d ( see fig.[fig : overview100]e ) .",
    "the main disagreement between calculations and experimental data is in the magnitude of the first negative peak .",
    "it seems that the best agreement between calculated and measured xmld spectra is achieved for the spectrum shown in fig.[fig : overview100]f .",
    "however , still the d feature ( positive shoulder on the high - energy side ) is not reproduced in the calculation .",
    "this was observed also in ref .",
    ", even when various approximations for the exchange - correlation term were used .",
    "the single oscillation in the xmld spectrum at the @xmath56 edge for magnetization along [ 100 ] is well reproduced .",
    "a poorer agreement between measured and calculated xmld spectra is found for both the fe @xmath1 edges for magnetization along [ 110 ] .",
    "experimentally , a single oscillation is observed here , while in ours and other theoretical calculations,@xcite a three peak structure is found . also , our calculated results differ from those of kallmayer _ _ et al.__@xcite for the @xmath56 edge again a single oscillation is computed , whereas experimentally predominantly a positive peak is detected , similar to ref . , and the negative peak is small .",
    "we ascribe this difference with ref . to recent improvement of our calculations of the dielectric tensor elements ( complex linear response formula ) and the present use of a more sophisticated multilayer model for describing the light - sample interaction ( fresnel theory using viovsk s formalism@xcite ) over the simpler approach used in ref",
    "..    the calculated xmld spectra are about one order of magnitude larger than the experiment .",
    "this is understandable in the tey experiment , as we do not account for any loss due to scattering within the sample .",
    "we have tested the effect of substrate ( 150 nm mgo ) as well as 3 nm capping layer of al or cr , where in addition to the _ ab initio _ calculated co@xmath2fesi optical data , we adopted for the capping and substrate experimental data from the x - ray database.@xcite we found that none of those influence the spectra in the energy range of the fe and co @xmath5-edges .",
    "using the lsda+__u _ _ approach for the electronic structure of co@xmath0fesi , we also calculated the xas and xmcd at the @xmath1 edges of si .",
    "the results are given in fig.[xmcd - si ] .",
    "the xmcd strength is calculated analog to section [ subsec : xmcdsi ] . from fig.[xmcd - si ] at 103ev we obtain @xmath81 .",
    "it means that xmcd is about 10% of the xas magnitude , which is in agreement with the experimental finding of 6% .",
    "note that experimental xmcd spectrum appears to exhibit a stronger broadening than the computed spectrum .",
    "the computed spectra only shows contribution from si , whereas experimentally we see contribution from co and fe , which create a huge background signal due to the weak si signal .",
    "we note that it is a general problem to subtract the background reliably .",
    "consistent with the experiment , we find that an @xmath56 edge xmcd signal is not present .",
    "the calculated xmcd spectrum is overall similar in shape to that calculated for si in fe@xmath72si by first - principles methods in ref .",

    "in summary , magnetic properties of two series of co@xmath0fesi  films , one capped with cr and the other with an al layer , were investigated .",
    "both series comprise four films , each exhibiting a different local order and varied saturation magnetization .",

    "the xmld spectra of a co@xmath2fesi@xmath3al@xmath4  film showed similar features like al - capped co@xmath0fesi .",
    "thus , an intermixing of al atoms of the co@xmath0fesi  subsurface during deposition was assumed .",
    "this is a finding which needs to be considered carefully when making tunnel barriers for tmr devices , since it is important to have a stoichometric structure at the interface . for a systematic investigation ,",

    "all samples show a clear dependence of the film quality on the deposition conditions , while the deposition temperature has the highest impact on the film quality . by increasing the deposition temperature the films",
    "are better ordered and furthermore the off - stoichiometry is reduced .",
    "comparison with _ ab initio _ calculated xmld spectra showed an overall good agreement , however , certain differences remain .",
