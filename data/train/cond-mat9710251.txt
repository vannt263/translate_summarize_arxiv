    "one of the most characteristic features of the high - t@xmath2 cuprates is the proximity of antiferromagnetic ( af ) and superconducting ( sc ) phases as a function of doping . as a result ,",
    "much of the theoretical effort has focused on trying to consistently treat the insulating - underdoped - optimally doped region of the phase diagram , in which af and sc tendencies compete and may have strong fluctuations .",
    "an interesting recent proposal is that of zhang.@xcite he suggests that the simplest way of unifying af and sc in the cuprates is to introduce a new five - component vector order parameter consisting of the three component staggered magnetisation , and two components associated with the real and imaginary parts of the d - wave sc order parameter .",
    "clearly this new concept is only useful if there exists some kind of symmetry ( higher than the known so(3)@xmath3u(1 ) ) which relates the af and sc sectors .",
    "his suggestion is that an approximate so(5 ) symmetry emerges in the low energy sector ( so(5 ) because the new composite order parameter has five components and transforms like a vector ) .",
    "if true , this would allow the construction of an so(5 ) quantum nonlinear @xmath4-model to explain the low - energy dynamics of the high t@xmath2 materials .",
    "this could explain the form of the phase diagram , and the so - called @xmath5-mode.@xcite    however , there have been several criticisms of this theory .",
    "some @xcite have focused more on the details of microscopic calculations in the framework of the t - j or hubbard models .",
    "others have added several physical objections.@xcite one response to these criticisms has been to attempt to construct concrete examples of extended microscopic hamiltonians which manifestly have an so(5 ) symmetry.@xcite but knowing the hamiltonian does not necessarily tell us much about the low energy behaviour .    in this paper",
    "we study a two - chain ladder hamiltonian that is related to popular two - dimensional models of the cuprates .",
    "one of the reasons that ladder systems have attracted such attention is that many experimental realisations of these systems are very closely related to the high t@xmath2 materials @xcite , and some have even exhibited superconductivity.@xcite from a theoretical point of view , powerful non - perturbative techniques such as bosonisation and conformal field theory ( cft ) exist in one dimension .",
    "this offers hope of starting with a microscopic hamiltonian and ending up with a tractable effective field theory . in this paper",
    "it is not our purpose to comment on the general validity of the so(5 ) idea but to explicitly study a simplified and more tractable model .",
    "there is a large body of literature on two - chain and ladder systems @xcite@xmath6@xcite ( for a review see ref .  ) . using a combination of weak coupling rg and bosonisation ,",
    "the phase diagram has been intensively investigated .",
    "these analyses reveal that for small interchain hopping there are interesting strong coupling phases .",
    "however , whilst abelian bosonisation and weak coupling rg are good for determining the phase diagram , they do not explicitly respect the symmetries of the system , nor do they provide detailed information about the correlations . in this paper",
    "we explore in more detail the strong coupling region of a two chain ladder system , taking care to preserve the full non - abelian symmetries and obtain the correlations .",
    "it is well known that many 2 chain ladder systems are spin liquids ; that is , they exhibit a spin gap for a wide range of different fillings and couplings .",
    "this is because the luttinger liquid is a quantum critical system , and as such , highly unstable to perturbations such as interchain coupling . in general",
    "there are a number of relevant couplings which can drive the system into a spin gap phase ( an explicit example is discussed in section vi ) .",
    "however , in this paper we study a simplified system in which there is no backscattering and as a result , no spin gap .",
    "this model is of interest because it displays remarkable similarities to some aspects of the zhang proposal in 2 dimensions.@xcite    the model we consider is a system of 2 spinful tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) models in the repulsive regime , coupled by a small interchain hopping .",
    "this corresponds to the case of no backscattering and was studied in refs .  , , .",
    "we demonstrate that the hopping only generates couplings in a certain sector of the theory ( which we call `` flavour '' ) , freezing it out of the effective action at energy scales below @xmath7 . in agreement with the above references , we find that this leaves a critical ( at t=0 ) spin and charge sector with conformal charge 5/2 . however , we go on to show that this can be represented as a system of 5 massless majorana fermions , or equivalently , an so(5)@xmath0 wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) model , deformed away from the symmetric point by marginal current - current interactions .",
    "these so(5 ) breaking terms are associated with spin charge separation ( spin and charge velocities not equal @xmath8 ) and the anomalous charge exponent ( @xmath9 ) , which distinguish the spin and charge sectors .",
    "thus the system is never exactly so(5 ) symmetric except in the trivial noninteracting case .",
    "nonetheless , this representation does have strong analogies with the zhang proposal in 2d ; the physics can be understood using an so(5 ) symmetric @xmath4-model with symmetry breaking terms . in this way we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of all correlation functions ; the correlations of the 5 component `` superspin '' are enhanced ( power law at t=0 ) ; we obtain their scaling dimensions .",
    "other fermion bilinears die away exponentially fast .",
    "sections ii - v are concerned with an analysis of this model , including its detailed symmetric description , the relevant currents , the @xmath5-operators , its correlations and low lying multiplets in the excitation spectrum .",
    "one important way in which the system we are studying differs from that considered by zhang is that we are away from half - filling , which is a very special point in 1d .",
    "exactly at half - filling it is necessary to consider the umklapp term , which causes a mott gap in the charge sector .",
    "@xcite then the low energy effective hamiltonian is simply a pure spin heisenberg model ( with exchange @xmath10 in the case of the repulsive hubbard model at strong @xmath11 ) .",
    "we comment further on this difference in section iv .    in section",
    "vi we finally consider the case of two coupled luttinger liquids , which differs from the previous model in that it includes marginal backscattering terms .",
    "an example of this is provided by some regions of the phase diagram of a system of 2 hubbard chains coupled by single particle hopping . in this more physical case ,",
    "we show in detail how the additional marginal terms cause a spin gap to appear in agreement with refs .  - , and numerical work such as ref .",
    "then the spectrum and correlations are as in ref .  ; there is a spin gap but the charge sector remains gapless .",
    "finally , we conclude .",
    "there is also an appendix which sketches out a bosonisation prescription that enables us to calculate the correlation functions of fermion bilinears .",
    "many systems of interacting one - dimensional fermions away from half filling fall into the luttinger liquid universality class .",
    "that is , they exhibit spin - charge separation , gapless excitations , anomalous power law correlations and the absence of a quasiparticle pole ( see ref .   for a recent review , and references therein ) .",
    "for example , the one - dimensional repulsive hubbard model away from half - filling is known from its exact solution to be a luttinger liquid all the way from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , as is the t - j model for small enough @xmath14 .",
    "one of the simplest two - chain models of this type that can be written down consists of two tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) models ( labelled by a chain index @xmath15 ) coupled by a small transverse hopping @xmath16 : [ tlmodel ] h = h_tl(1)+h_tl(2)+h_where the tl hamiltonian is a sum of three pieces ( @xmath17 ) : h_0(i)= & iv_f&_dx ( r^_,i_x r_,i - l^_,i_x l_,i ) + h_2(i)= & g_2&_,bdx j_,i^r(x)j_,i^l(x ) + h_4(i)= & g_4&_,dx ( j_,i^r(x)j_,i^r(x ) + j_,i^l(x)j_,i^l(x ) ) [ tl ] the current ( or density ) is simply defined as [ density ] j^r_,i = r_,i^r_,i j^l_,i = l_,i^l_,i and the electrons fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 are slowly varying on an atomic scale : the electron annihilation operator at site @xmath20 , chain @xmath21 and spin @xmath22 may be expressed as [ cont ] c_,i(x ) = r_,i(x)^ik_fx + l_,i(x)^-ik_fx in terms of these fields , the simple interchain hopping term becomes h_= t_dx _",
    "( r_,1^(x)r_,2(x ) + l_,1^(x)l_,2(x ) + h.c . ) for simplicity , we have assumed that the hamiltonian is invariant under spin rotation , and so the coupling constants @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the same for parallel and antiparallel spin configurations .",
    "normal ordering is assumed throughout in products of local fields ( definition of currents , hamiltonians , etc . ) .",
    "it is worth making a quick observation about the difference between the terms tl _ liquid _ and tl _ model _ : the tl model is an idealised and specific hamiltonian , written down in eq .",
    "( [ tl ] ) .",
    "it has a perfectly linear dispersion , an infinitely deep fermi sea , has only density - density interactions and is exactly solvable for all values of the coupling constants ( the model is unstable beyond a critical value of @xmath23).@xcite the tl liquid ( which is the generic state corresponding to many realistic hamiltonians like the hubbard model away from half filling ) differs in that the dispersion is no longer exactly linear , and the fermi sea no longer infinitely deep . but from our point of view the most important difference in the low energy sector is the presence of marginally irrelevant couplings ( backscattering ) . in a single chain system",
    "these are not very important when repulsive  they simply give logarithmic corrections to the correlation functions . in section vi we will study the effect of these additional terms in the two chain system , in order to establish the behaviour of the more realistic coupled tl _ liquids _ , but for the moment , we will restrict our attention to the simpler case of coupled tl _ models_.    the model ( [ tlmodel ] ) , even though it is made of tl models , is not exactly solvable because of the interchain hopping . however , we will argue presently that the model segregates into three different _ sectors _ , respectively associated with charge , spin , and `` flavour '' , and that the combined effect of interchain hopping and interactions is to make the flavour sector massive , leaving only the charge and spin sectors critical ( i.e. , gapless ) . to each sector",
    "one may associate current operators , expressed as bilinears of the electron fields : [ currents ] & j_r(x ) & = _ , i r^_,i(x)r_,i(x ) + & * j*_r(x ) & = _ i , , r^_,i(x ) _",
    "r_,i(x ) + & * i*_r(x ) & = _ i , j , r^_,i(x ) _ ij r_,j(x ) where @xmath25 is the vector of pauli matrices ( left - moving currents are defined similarly ) .",
    "these currents have the following commutation relations ( they may be derived from wick s theorem ) : & = & -2i(x - y ) [ j_r^a(x),j_r^b(y ) ] & = & -i2 ^ab(x - y ) + i^abcj_r^c(y)(x - y ) [ i_r^i(x),i_r^j(y ) ] & = & -i2 ^ij(x - y ) + i_ijki_r^k(y)(x - y ) and currents of different types ( i.e. , charge , spin , and flavour ) commute .",
    "thus in the language of non - abelian bosonisation , the charge current obeys a u(1 ) kac - moody algebra , and the spin and flavour currents obey su(2)@xmath26so(3)@xmath0 algebras.@xcite it is simple to show that the hamiltonian ( [ tlmodel ] ) may be expressed as @xmath27 , where only the above currents appear .",
    "this is just a matter of taking careful account of point - splitting and normal ordering:@xcite [ ham2 ] h_0 & = & v_f2dx ( j_r^2 + * j*_r^2 + * i*_r^2 +  [ rl ] ) + v_c & = & dx\\ { g_2 j_rj_l+g_4(j_r^2+j_l^2 ) } + v_f & = & 2dx\\ { g_2i_r^zi_l^z+g_4[(i_r^z)^2+(i_l^z)^2 ] + t _",
    "( i_r^x + i_l^x ) } therefore the model ( [ tlmodel ] ) decouples into three independent sectors ( charge , spin , flavour ) .",
    "the important point is that the hopping term only involves the flavour sector , which is decoupled from the other two .",
    "the effect of interactions ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) on the charge sector will be a velocity renormalisation and anomalous scaling exponents ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the combined effect of interactions and transverse hopping on the flavour sector is more dramatic .",
    "the rg analysis of ref .   shows unambiguously that in the repulsive regime ( @xmath29 ) , the system scales to strong coupling at energies @xmath30 ( in the notation of ref .",
    "our model corresponds to initial conditions of @xmath31 , @xmath32 for @xmath33 ) .",
    "the combination of the small hopping term @xmath7 and the interaction terms leads to the generation of important couplings in the rg process , giving a gap in some channels .",
    "what our analysis tells us is that all of this physics is only happening in the flavour sector , and thus it is this sector that becomes gapped , while the total spin and total charge sectors remain untouched and critical .",
    "so at low enough energies the flavour sector is frozen out of the effective theory , and our task is simply to understand the remaining charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "each electron field @xmath18 or @xmath19 carries charge , spin and flavour .",
    "the separation of the model into charge , spin and flavour sectors is therefore difficult to describe in terms of these operators .",
    "however , one may introduce a different set of fermi fields in terms of which this separation is much more natural .",
    "to this end , we must use some representation theory of lie groups .",
    "let us first consider the model ( [ tlmodel ] ) , but without interactions or interchain hopping ( i.e. , two free , decoupled chains ) .",
    "this model has so(8 ) symmetry , and this may be shown has follows .",
    "each complex field @xmath34 may be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts : @xmath35 and then , except for a total derivative , the hamiltonian @xmath36 takes the form h_0 = iv_f_dx ( r__x r_-l__x l _ ) where the composite index @xmath37 , running from 1 to 8 , stands for spin , chain and real / imaginary part .",
    "the eight fermi fields @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) can undergo an internal so(8 ) rotation that leaves @xmath36 invariant .",
    "hence the model has a chiral so(8 ) symmetry .",
    "it is well known that a collection of @xmath40 real free fermions like this is equivalent to a special kind of conformal field theory : a level-1 so(n ) wzw model.@xcite chiral so(8 ) currents may be defined in terms of those real fermions as follows : [ so8curra ] j^a_r = _ , = 1 ^ 8 r_s^a _",
    "r_where @xmath41 is a matrix representation of the generators of so(8 ) ( @xmath42 runs from 1 to @xmath43 , the number of generators ) .",
    "left - moving currents are defined similarly .",
    "the charge , spin and flavour currents ( [ currents ] ) are special cases of the above and correspond to specific values of the index @xmath42 if the generators @xmath44 are chosen judiciously .",
    "the currents ( [ so8curra ] ) are bilinears in the electrons fields @xmath38 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , the so(8)@xmath0 wzw model contains other fields , belonging to a different representation of so(8 ) , in terms of which these currents are also bilinears . among all so(n ) groups , so(8 ) is peculiar in that its vector representation , of dimension 8 , has properties identical to its spinor and conjugate spinor representations ( also of dimension 8) . indeed , which one is called ` vector ' is a matter of convention , dictated by the way the so(8 ) symmetry breaks down to smaller so(n ) components . in order to decide to which so(8 ) representation the electron fields belong",
    ", one must study in detail how each representation breaks down when the symmetry is reduced .",
    "let us consider a two - stage symmetry breaking , in which the flavour sector , with its su(2 ) , is first segregated , and then the charge u(1 ) and spin su(2 ) ( note that u(1)@xmath46so(2 ) and su(2)@xmath46so(3 ) ) : [ break ] so(8 ) so(5)so(3)^fl .",
    "we stress that the goal of the present analysis is to fit the fields and states of the model into symmetry multiplets , without demanding the symmetry to be exact . in the first stage of this breakdown , the vector and spinor representations of so(8 )",

[ so5fig ] . for instance , the so(5 ) spinor @xmath51 breaks down into two spin-@xmath54 doublets , one with charge + 1 and the other with charge -1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the vector representation breaks down into a spin-1 triplet of charge zero and two singlets of charges @xmath55 .",
    "we may now ascertain that the electron fields @xmath38 belong to the _ spinor _ representation of so(8 ) .",
    "indeed , the lowest excited states of @xmath36 , obtained by acting on the vacuum with the lowest electron creation operators , form a multiplet of 4 states of charge @xmath56 and four states of charge @xmath57 .",
    "this is precisely the charge content of the spinor multiplet @xmath58 , since the spinor @xmath51 of so(5 ) contains two states of charge @xmath56 and two of charge @xmath57 , and appears twice in the decomposition ( [ decomp1 ] ) , because of the flavour doublet .",
    "a different set of real fermions , denoted @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , belongs to the _ vector _ representation of so(8 ) .",
    "these new fermions are related in a complicated , nonlocal way to the original fermions .",
    "the transformation relating them may be explicitly obtained via abelian bosonisation , if one takes care to preserve the anticommutation factors , but this is not a particularly illuminating procedure .",
    "the important point is that they are just a different basis or representation for the same system .",
    "these fermions obey the usual anticommutation relations @xmath61 .",
    "the so(8 ) currents ( [ so8curra ] ) may also be expressed as bilinears of these fermions , albeit with the help of a different set of so(8 ) matrices : j_r^a = 12_ij_it^a_ij_j a characteristic feature of the vector representation is its particularly simple decomposition into charge , spin and flavour components : in the first stage of the breakdown ( [ break ] ) , the vector representation decomposes as @xmath62 . in the second stage",

    "the majorana fermions are nonetheless legitimate operators of the theory .",
    "for instance , at half - filling , if all sectors became gapped , the three spin fermions @xmath64 would describe the triplet of spin excitations characteristic of a gapped spin-1 chain.@xcite",
    "we have seen above that the spin and charge degrees of freedom , which make up the critical sector of the theory ( [ tlmodel ] ) , may be described by the five majorana fermions @xmath69 and @xmath70 . except for the interaction @xmath71 of eq .",

    "we want to know the long distance ( low energy ) behaviour of the correlations of various bilinears . in sect .",
    "( [ nabos ] ) we demonstrated that the correlations of the `` superspin '' order parameter could be deduced within the framework of non - abelian bosonisation from a careful analysis of the operators of the conformal field theory . we can further justify this analysis and find the behaviour of the other fermion bilinears explicitly by using abelian bosonisation .    we introduce an abelian boson @xmath218 for each species of fermion @xmath15 , @xmath97 . then we introduce linear charge and spin , bonding and antibonding combinations of these fields : _ ^ & = & 12(_^1_^2 ) + ^i_c , s & = & 12 ( ^i_^i _ ) if one carefully applies abelian bosonisation to the original hamiltonian ( [ tlmodel ] ) , taking full account of the anticommutation factors,@xcite one can identify each of these bose fields with two of the majorana fermions introduced in section ( 4 ) . the @xmath219 field is simply associated with the two charge fermions , the @xmath220 field represents two of the flavour fermions .",
    "@xmath221 represents two of the spin fermions , and @xmath222 comprises one flavour fermion and one spin fermion .",
    "after bosonisation , the various fermion bilinears have the form ~^-ix where the different @xmath223s are given in table [ bilin ] .",
    "we will briefly describe how we arrive at the long distance behaviour of their correlations .",
    "we find straightforwardly : ( ^i_s^+)&= & ( ^i_s^+)=18 + ( ^i_c^+)&=&k_c8 + ( ^i_c^+)&=&18k_c ( the scaling dimension is @xmath224 and here @xmath225 so @xmath226 ) but the charge and spin ( @xmath227 ) fields are a little more subtle . in our model ,",
    "the flavour sector acquires a gap .",
    "since we start with @xmath29 this strong coupling regime corresponds to the limit @xmath228 in the c@xmath227 sector , whence to leading approximation we can replace the complex exponents by their expectation values : ^i_c^-&&0 + ^i_c^-&=&0 higher order corrections will die away exponentially .",
    "thus the bilinears ( a ) , ( e ) and ( f ) in table  [ bilin ] die away exponentially and the corresponding tendencies are suppressed .",
    "the exponents of @xmath222 are a little more subtle since we know that only one of the majorana fermions to which @xmath222 corresponds is gapped , whilst the other remains gapless . here , however , we can make use of their representation in terms of the corresponding ising order and disorder operators.@xcite introducing ising order and disorder operators @xmath229 corresponding to the majorana flavour fermion @xmath230 and @xmath231 corresponding to the spin fermion @xmath232 , we can identify the following approximate operator correspondences : _",

    "thus to first approximation these can again be replaced by their expectation values .",
    "the ising model corresponding to the spin fermion @xmath232 remains critical and has scaling dimensions @xmath237 . in this way",
    "we obtain the long distance asymptotics shown in table  [ bilin ] .",
    "the only bilinears which still have power law correlations are the interchain pairing ( [ d - wave ] ) , represented by ( b ) in table  [ bilin ] , and the staggered magnetisation ( [ staggeredmag ] ) , represented by ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "thus , it is precisely the components of the unified order parameter @xmath131 that have power law correlations , while all the other tendencies around @xmath238 are suppressed .",
