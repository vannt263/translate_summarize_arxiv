    "alice @xcite ( a large ion collider experiment ) is the dedicated heavy  ion experiment at the cern lhc focusing on the study of the physics of strongly interacting matter at extreme energy densities , where the formation of a new phase of matter , the quark  gluon plasma ( qgp ) , is expected .",
    "alice is also studying proton  proton collisions both for comparison with pb ",
    "pb collisions and in physics areas where alice is competitive with other lhc experiments .",
    "particle identification ( pid ) is a crucial aspect of the alice experiment .",
    "the silicon inner tracking system ( its ) and the time projection chamber ( tpc ) identify charged particles below 1 gev / c using the @xmath2 measurements . from 1 gev / c to a few gev / c the time  of  flight ( tof ) detector extends the pid capabilities of alice with a complete coverage of the central region .",
    "a transition radiator detector ( trd ) and a cherenkov ring image detector ( hmpid ) further increase the pid capabilities of the experiment .",
    "a detailed review of alice and of its pid strategy can be found in @xcite . + the tof @xcite is a large area detector covering a cylindrical surface of 141 @xmath3 with an inner radius of 3.7 m , a pseudorapidity interval [ -0.9,+0.9 ] and full azimuthal coverage .",
    "the tof exploits the innovative multigap resistive plate chamber ( mrpc ) @xcite technology , capable of an intrinsic time resolution better than 50 ps with an efficiency close to 100% and a large operational plateau .",
    "the whole system is made of 1593 mrpcs arranged into 90 gas  tight modules which are grouped into 18 supermodules ( sm ) each covering an azimuthal angle of 20 degrees .",
    "unlike the standard rpcs , in the mrpcs the gas gap between the electrodes is divided by means of internal plates which are physical barriers stopping the avalanche growing too big ; in this way it is possible to apply a very intense electric field and still operate the device in avalanche mode with many advantages in terms of time resolution and rate capability .",
    "the very good time resolution of the mrpc is due to the strong uniform electric field , which provokes the avalanche process immediately after primary ionization is deposited in the gas volume . as a consequence , the intrinsic detector resolution is determined mainly by the avalanche statistics .",
    "+ the mrpcs for the alice tof are designed as double  stack strips .",
    "each stack has 5 gas gaps of 250 @xmath4 m width ; the two stacks are placed on each side of a central anode .",
    "the resistive plates are made of high  resistivity ( @xmath5@xmath6 @xmath7 cm ) _ soda  lime _ commercial glass 0.4 mm thick .",
    "compared to melamine  phenolic plastic materials ,",
    "the choice of glass plates ensures higher uniformity of the gap size and higher stability for long  term behavior . on the outer surface of the external plates a very intense electric field ( @xmath8100 kv / cm )",
    "is applied by means of a specially developed acrylic paint loaded with metal oxides giving a surface resistivity between 2 and 25 m@xmath9 .",
    "the pick  up elements are 2.5 @xmath10 3.5 @xmath11 area pads placed outside the external plates .",
    "the gas mixture used is c@xmath12h@xmath12f@xmath13 ( 93% ) and sf@xmath14 ( 7% ) .",
    "+ test beam results may be found in @xcite , where a time resolution better than 50 ps , including all of the electronic readout contribution , and an efficiency close to 100% with a long streamer ",
    "free efficiency plateau have been measured .",
    "the commissioning of the full tof detector was performed in 2008 and 2009 @xcite and all operating parameters have been measured to be well within the expectations of the project .",
    "+ measurements with the hv system indicate that without beam the dark current of the alice tof mrpcs is extremely low , at the na / mrpc level at 13 kv ( 6.5 kv positive and 6.5 kv negative hv ) . during lhc operation",
    ", even at the maximum charged particle flux sustainable by the alice detector , corresponding to a istantaneus luminosity of @xmath15 = 2@xmath1610@xmath17s@xmath18@xmath19 , the current drawn by the 1593 mrpcs comprising the tof is around 35 @xmath4a , less than 25 na per mrpc .",
    "this very small current indicates that no aging effect are present in the mrpcs .",
    "+ also detector noise benefits from this small current .",
    "the tof dark noise has been found substantially reduced with respect to predictions ; at the nominal threshold an average rate of 0.2 hz / cm@xmath1 has been measured .",
    "thus , the tof trigger is the preferred choice for cosmic runs in alice , with a rate of @xmath5 10 hz for pure back  to  back topology and 50% of purity @xcite .",
    "we note that these results have been achieved running all the mrpcs at the same voltage and with all front  end electronics thresholds set at the same value .",
    "+ during the lhc heavy ",
    "ion program in november 2010 the tof contributed to the trigger of ultra  peripheral collisions ( upc ) in the barrel . in such events two relativistic nuclei collide with impact parameter larger than twice their radius ; they provide a powerful tool to study the gluon distribution function in the nuclei without hadronic background .",
    "a relevant process in upc is the production of vector mesons containing heavy flavours .",
    "the total cross section for this process is a small fraction of the total pb ",
    "pb cross section , therefore dedicated triggers have been used to tag these events both in the barrel and in the forward muon arm of alice .",
    "the upc trigger in the barrel requires signals coming from the central detectors ( its and tof ) with forward detectors not showing any activity . in fig",

    "the overall efficiency of the tof detector can be estimated by means of the track matching efficiency defined as the ratio between the number of tracks reconstructed in the tpc that have produced a detectable signal on tof and the total number of tracks reconstructed in the tpc .",
    "this ratio includes not only the mrpc efficiencies but also dead spaces in the tof array , particle decays , interaction with materials as well as inefficiencies of the algorithm .",
    "3 the efficiency of the tof matching is compared for positive and negative particles in a monte carlo ( mc ) sample and in real data for different @xmath25 values . in the mc",
    "the single pad efficiency is 98% , averaged over the whole pad area and as measured in the test beam .",
    "the good match between mc and real data , for this and for other particle samples , indicates that the tof efficiency is similar to the 98% used in the mc simulations .",

    "a time  of  flight measurement is based on the quantity @xmath26 - @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the time measurement made by the tof detector while @xmath27 is the time of the interaction , measured in alice by means of :    a.   a dedicated cherenkov detector ( t0 ) ; b.   tof detector itself if the amount of tracks reaching the tof is enough to perform a global time minimization ; c.   the average @xmath27 of lhc fill with resolution @xmath28/c ( finite length of colliding bunches of particles ) .    the design goal for the alice tof requires a global time resolution of @xmath5 80 ps .",
    "a measurement of this resolution can be performed as in fig .",

    "pb collisions at @xmath23 = 2.76 tev recorded in november 2010 ; the result of the fit is the tof time resolution .",
    "the value quoted here includes the intrinsic time resolution of the detector technology plus contributions from electronics ( amplification and time  to  digital conversion ) , uncertainties arising from the distribution of the digital clock from the lhc to the experiments , the spread of the @xmath27 signal ( here @xmath5 10 ps obtained with method b ) , contributions from the tracking and from calibration . in future",
