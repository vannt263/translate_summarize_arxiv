    "non - interacting electron systems with uniformly distributed disorder usually show an anderson transition from localized to extended states .",

    ", one has an interplay between the hopping range and the degree of disorder .",
    "the former favors propagation while the later inhibits it .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that propagation of carriers was also obtained in low - dimensional models with short - range hopping but presenting correlated disorder , such as random dimer chains @xcite and in chains with scale - free disorder@xcite , as well as in chains containing quasi - periodic structures , as for example fibonacci , thue - morse , harper sequences  @xcite .    on the other hand , for an ordered 1d system with hopping terms decaying with a power - law with exponent @xmath3",

    "the localization is lost . when the power exponent equals unity , and for sufficient short times , the packet diffuses with a diffusion coefficient that increases with the number of sites .",
    "this effect is absent in the model with only nearest - neighbor hopping  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was studied the dynamics of an electron in a one - dimensional anderson model with non - random hoppings falling off as some power @xmath3 of the distance between sites  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the larger the hopping range , the more extended the wave - packet becomes as time evolves .",

    "it develops a power - law decaying tail with @xmath73 ( see inset ) , as expected according to the wave - function normalization constraint . before reaching the chain boundaries ,",
    "the average wave - function envelope can be well described by @xmath74 for @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a time dependent cutoff after which the wave - function decays exponentially and , therefore , can be considered as having a vanishing amplitude .",

    "for which the wave - function develops the power - law form given by eq.(10 ) , the participation moments present a non - trivial scaling .",
    "two distinct behaviors can be anticipated . for @xmath85",
    ", the participation moment shall display a power - law growth ( after a short waiting time ) on the form @xmath86 , followed by a saturation after reaching the chain boundaries .",
    "the saturation plateau is predicted to scale as @xmath87 .",
    "both time regimes can be represented by a single finite - size scaling hypothesis for the participation moment which can be written as @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in fig .  4",
    ", we show our numerical results for the scaled second moment ( @xmath91 ) versus scaled time ( @xmath79 ) , which falls in the above regime of @xmath85 .",
    "these data were averaged over @xmath92 time histories considering distinct disorder configurations .",
    "the second moment remains constant during a very short initial waiting time before the spread effectively starts to take place . after that",
    ", we found that the above scaling hypothesis reproduces very well the participation time - evolution as data from distinct chain sizes could be collapsed in the same curve .",
    "as anticipated , the participation moment has a power - law growth followed by a saturation .",
    "the slight deviation from perfect collapse is due to corrections to scaling which are more pronounced for the smaller system sizes .",
    "the maximum displayed by the participation number reflects the destructive interference between the incident and reflected waves near the chain boundaries .    for @xmath93 , the presence of a cutoff does not influence the initial spread of the participation moments .",
    "therefore , the initial growth is completely determined by the return probability decay and results in @xmath94 . on the other hand ,",
    "the scaling of the asymptotic plateau only depends on the wave - function decay exponent , being given by @xmath95 . for this regime ,",
    "the proper scaling form of the participation moment reads @xmath96 with @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in figure  5",
    "we show the scaling analysis of participation moments for this regime ( @xmath99 and @xmath100 ) .",
    "the trends are mainly the same as that presented by @xmath81 , namely data collapse with saturation for long times and a power - law growth for intermediate times preceded by a size independent initial waiting time .",
    "however , the participation moment scaling exponent now depends on the wave - function decay exponent as predicted by eq.(13 ) .    in both regimes ,",
    "the characteristic time scale after that finite - size effects starts to take place scales as @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .",
    "the fact that this scaling exponent is smaller than unity ( and therefore corresponds to a faster than ballistic dynamics ) is related to the non - local nature of the long - range couplings .",
    "finally , for exponentially localized wave - functions @xmath103^{1/(q-1)}$ ] is proportional to the localization length for any @xmath21 . using @xmath104 as a measure of the characteristic size of the present power - law decaying wave - packet",
    ", this feature is only true for @xmath85 . for higher moments it displays a sub - linear size dependence whose exponent continuously decreases towards @xmath105 as @xmath106 .",
    "we investigated the one - dimensional anderson model with off - diagonal disorder and matrix elements @xmath30 decaying as @xmath107 for @xmath1 ( critical regime ) . using an exact diagonalization scheme on finite chains",
    ", we computed the participation moments of all energy eigenstates and reported the critical exponents @xmath17 associated with the multifractal character of the stationary states .",
    "examining the time - evolution of an initially localized wave - packet , we observed that the wave - function develops a power - law tail in the form @xmath108 with @xmath45 .",
    "it achieves a stationary non - uniform profile after reflecting at the chain boundaries . as a consequence ,",
    "the time - dependent participation moments @xmath109 exhibit a non - trivial finite - size scaling . for @xmath85 ,",
    "the participation moments grow in time as @xmath110 , where the exponent @xmath111 governs the decay of the return probability as well as the one of the autocorrelation function .",
    "it saturates in a plateau proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the usual participation number @xmath81 reaches a value proportional to the chain size as occurs with a uniformly distributed state .",
    "higher order participation moments with @xmath93 grow in time as @xmath113 and saturate at a plateau proportional to @xmath114 .",
    "we used a finite - size scaling hypothesis to put the participation moments in a universal form as a function of the reduced variable @xmath79 .",
    "as such , the characteristic size of the wave - packet grows in time as @xmath115 , which for the present model with long - range couplings results in a faster than ballistic spread .",
    "the proposed dynamic scaling relations are expected to remain valid for general model systems of waves spreading in a power - law fashion over a random medium@xcite .",
    "the special character of the present model , with all energy eigenstates being multifractal , provides a clear picture of the complex dynamic scaling which takes place at the vicinity of the anderson transition .",
