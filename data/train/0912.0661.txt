    "finite - time singularities are ubiquitous in hydrodynamic flows , and whenever they appear they attract much interest @xcite . wave breaking in ideal gas flows @xcite , pinching of droplets @xcite and creation of black holes @xcite are examples of finite - time singularities which dramatically change the dynamics in the system when they appear .",
    "singularities often signal breakdown of theory . in this case",
    "either the theory is regularized by introducing additional macroscopic mechanisms , or the continuum description is abandoned in favor of a discrete microscopic theory .",
    "a long - standing problem of hydrodynamics is whether a finite - time vorticity singularity develops in an initially smooth three - dimensional incompressible flow . despite considerable effort , both the inviscid euler case @xcite , and the viscous , navier - stokes case @xcite remain unresolved .    the present paper deals with a somewhat simpler problem of finite - time density singularities in dilute granular gases .",
    "in contrast to ordinary molecular gases , granular gases  cool \" spontaneously because of the inelastic collisions between the grains . strikingly , even a slight inelasticity of the collisions may cause the granular gas to form dense clusters of particles , even when starting from a dilute and macroscopically homogeneous initial state .",
    "this fascinating example of structure formation has been investigated by means of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "in addition , as many as five different hydrodynamical scenarios have been suggested for the clustering instability ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a concise critical review .",
    "the clustering instability in granular gases has an interesting analog in the form of condensation instability in optically thin gases and plasmas that cool by their own radiation @xcite .",
    "the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics is a natural starting point for a physicist who wants to understand and predict collective physical phenomena in granular gases @xcite .",
    "granular hydrodynamics provides powerful insights into the physics of granular flow , not in a small part because its predictions are occasionally successful beyond its ( quite restrictive ) formal limits of validity @xcite . in the present work we will employ the navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics in an attempt to better understand the physics of clustering , including its ultimate stage of thermal collapse , in a freely - cooling dilute granular gas in two dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "we will assume throughout the paper that the particle collisions are nearly elastic , the local gas density ( that we denote by @xmath0 ) is much smaller than the close - packing density , and the knudsen number of the granular gas is very small : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the coefficient of normal restitution of binary collisions , @xmath3 is the particle diameter , @xmath4 is the dimension of space , @xmath5 is the mean free path of the gas , and @xmath6 is the characteristic hydrodynamic length scale . under these assumptions ( the second and third of them need to be verified _ a posteriori _ , after the hydrodynamic problem in question is solved ) the navier - stokes hydrodynamics provides a quantitatively accurate leading - order theory @xcite .    in a sufficiently small container ,",

    "this homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) is linearly unstable , however , when the container size exceeds a critical value @xcite .",
    "the instability manifests itself by the appearance of density inhomogeneities ( the clustering instability ) and vortical motions ( the shear instability ) , each of them with its own critical system size .",
    "preceding our work is a series of papers @xcite which dealt with nonlinear clustering dynamics of a freely - cooling granular gas in a narrow channel .",
    "@xcite investigated the nonlinear clustering analytically and numerically , using _ ideal _",
    "( euler ) granular hydrodynamics for a dilute gas which neglects heat diffusion and viscosity .",
    "they found a family of exact analytic solutions for the clustering flow .",
    "these solutions describe the evolution of an initially smooth flow toward thermal collapse : a finite - time density blowup .",
    "close to the blowup time @xmath10 , the maximum gas density exhibits a power law behavior @xmath11 .",
    "the minimum temperature of the gas vanishes as @xmath12 .",
    "the velocity gradient blows up as @xmath13 , whereas the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp , rather than a shock discontinuity , at the singularity .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations of a freely cooling granular gas in a channel geometry @xcite showed an excellent agreement with one of the exact solutions until sufficiently close to the attempted collapse , where heat diffusion becomes important . at finite gravity ,",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) cooling flow also develops thermal collapse , and exhibits the same asymptotic scaling behavior near the singularity , even in the framework of non - ideal , navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics @xcite .    despite the blowup of the density and the velocity gradient ,",
    "the gas pressure behaves regularly in all examples of thermal collapse considered in refs . @xcite . at zero gravity",
    "the collapse occurs at almost constant pressure @xcite , whereas at finite gravity the pressure is approximately hydrostatic @xcite .",
    "the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite took advantage of these salient features to greatly simplify the full 1d hydrodynamic problem , which takes a full account of heat diffusion and viscosity .",
    "it turns out that , at zero gravity , the heat diffusion arrests the thermal collapse in 1d @xcite . instead of blowing up",
    ", the gas density approaches a time - independent inhomogeneous cooling sate in which the heat diffusion balances the clustering instability brought about by the collisional energy loss .",
    "these 1d hydrodynamic results , however , are strikingly different from those observed in molecular dynamics simulations of a freely cooling granular gas in 2d @xcite , where the gas density continues to grow until close - packed clusters of of particles are formed . to address this issue , the nonlinear hydrodynamic theory of clustering must be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the first step in this direction has been recently taken by fouxon @xcite .",
    "assuming a zero pressure gradient and using lagrangian coordinates he showed that , in the framework of _ ideal _ hydrodynamics , thermal collapse persists in any dimension . in lagrangian coordinates the flow singularity turns out to be identical to the one found in 1d @xcite .",
    "fouxon @xcite also briefly considered the _ non - ideal _ , navier - stokes flow .",
    "here he found inhomogeneous solutions with time - independent density profiles , but left open the question of their stability .    in this work",
    "we apply navier - stokes hydrodynamics to a freely - cooling granular gas in 2d , in a circular geometry .",
    "the final outcome of our work is quite different both from the previous 1d results @xcite , and from the results of ref .",
    "the hydrodynamic problem is formulated in section [ hydro ] . in section",
    "[ marginal ] we perform a marginal stability analysis of the hcs in a circular container and find the critical radii of the container for the clustering modes and shear modes .",
    "one of the surprising results , presented in section [ disk_section ] , shows that the clustering instability appears in this geometry via a sub - critical bifurcation .",
    "this suggests that the dilute flow can develop thermal collapse , and we support this conjecture by hydrodynamic simulation ( that is , by solving the hydrodynamic equations numerically ) . to get a more analytical insight we switch , in section [ cluster ] , to a narrow - sector - shaped container ,",

    "we find that , in the sector geometry , the bifurcation of the clustering instability is transcritical . here",
    "stable time - independent azimuthally - symmetric inhomogeneous density states exist with a density peak at the circumference of the sector .",
    "for these states the density growth is exactly balanced by heat diffusion .",
    "but on the same bifurcation diagram there also regions which do not correspond to any time - independent state .",
    "our hydrodynamic simulations in these regions give a strong evidence for thermal collapse unarrested by heat diffusion , this time at the vertex of the sector .",
    "we investigate thermal collapse analytically in section [ collapse ] .",
    "we determine scaling laws , in time and in space , for an _ ideal _ collapse which we assume to develop on the background of an almost constant pressure . using the scaling laws we find that the non - ideal transport mechanisms  heat diffusion and viscosity  are in general unable to arrest the collapse in any dimension higher than one .",
    "the granular hydrodynamic equations express local conservation of mass and momentum , and local energy balance , in the granular gas .",
    "assuming the strong inequalities ( [ threeineq ] ) , one can use the following set of hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",

    "let @xmath44 be the radius of the container .",
    "we choose the boundary conditions so as not to introduce any sources or sinks of mass , momentum and energy , and also not to break azimuthal symmetry .",
    "therefore , we demand a zero granular heat flux through the circumference @xmath45 which , for @xmath46 , leads to @xmath47 furthermore , we demand that particle collisions with the wall @xmath45 be elastic , and that the wall be impenetrable . these lead to slip boundary condition for @xmath48 and zero boundary condition for @xmath49 : @xmath50 although somewhat restrictive , boundary conditions ( [ temp_bc ] ) and ( [ slip_bc ] ) allow a lot of insight into the problem , as will become clear shortly .",
    "the case of no - slip boundary condition , @xmath51 , is briefly discussed in section [ marginal ] d.    for the narrow - sector - shaped container one should also prescribe boundary conditions on the straight segments of the sector . however , in the absence of azimuthal variations of the hydrodynamic fields , and for @xmath52 , there is no need of prescribing these boundary conditions explicitly",

    ", a pressure gradient can not create torque , whereas a viscous stress causes the momentum only to diffuse but not to dissipate .",
    "in addition , the wall @xmath45 exerts , according to the boundary conditions ( [ slip_bc ] ) , an effective force on the gas only in the radial direction which again does not produce a torque .",
    "equation  ( [ econ ] ) describes the global energy loss of the gas .",
    "as the wall is adiabatic , energy can only escape to the internal degrees of freedom of the grains .",
    "equation  ( [ econ ] ) states that , as long as the gas is not  frozen \" ( @xmath56 ) , the energy will continue to dissipate .",
    "relations  ( [ mcon])-([econ ] ) are also valid in the sector geometry .",

    "is satisfied trivially , as @xmath57 .",
    "apart from inertia of the flow , there are two competing mechanisms which ultimately determine the spatial structure of a freely cooling granular gas .",
    "these are the inelastic energy loss which drives the clustering- and shear - mode instabilities @xcite , and the heat diffusion and viscosity which tend to erase inhomogeneities in the gas .",
    "the rest of parameters being fixed , the heat diffusion and viscosity prevail in sufficiently small containers ; here the granular gas approaches the hcs . when the container size is increased , larger - scale perturbations become possible , and the hcs eventually loses its stability . in this section",
    "we will find the critical radii of the circular container for the clustering modes and the shear mode which can bifurcate from the hcs .",

    "the spatial length scale of the pressure is still much larger ( by more than two orders of magnitude ) than the dynamic length scale @xmath195 .",

    "this fact enabled us to investigate a strongly nonlinear dynamics of a linearly unstable clustering mode in a 2d setting , without worrying about the shear mode .",
    "we have presented analytic and numeric evidence for thermal collapse , unarrested by heat diffusion , in a freely cooling dilute granular gas in 2d .",
    "our results imply that navier - stokes hydrodynamics of dilute granular gases exhibits , in dimension higher than one , finite - time density blowups .",
    "this is in striking contrast to the  wave breaking \" singularities of an ideal flow ( both in a  classical \" gas @xcite , and in a granular gas @xcite ) which are arrested by the viscosity and heat diffusion , bringing about _",

    "we have derived the dynamic scaling laws of thermal collapse by assuming a locally uniform pressure profile .",
    "all the scaling laws , and the uniform - pressure scenario , have been corroborated in our hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate , presented in appendix b , suggests that the uniform - pressure scenario must break down sufficiently close to the singularity .",
    "we have not observed this breakdown in our hydrodynamic simulations : the uniform - pressure scenario agreed very well with the simulations until the latest simulation times we were able to reach .",
    "this may be related to some small numerical factors which improve the applicability of the uniform - pressure scenario beyond what our order - of - magnitude estimate predicts .",
    "future work should address this issue and find out whether the uniform - pressure scenario gives way to the zero - pressure scenario where a different type of singularity  that of a free flow  develops @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the hydrodynamics of clustering in a free cooling granular gas in 3d .",
    "one can speculate that the 2d singularities , analyzed in this work , are the _ generic _ type of singularity in 3d .",
    "indeed , a locally-2d pinching may be more common than a fully-3d collapse .",
    "the dynamic scaling laws , that describe the density singularity , provide a sharp characterization of a strongly nonlinear stage of clustering instability . when the growing - in - time gas density peak reaches a fraction of the close - packing density @xmath201 , the dilute hydrodynamic equations break down .",
    "our solutions describing thermal collapse represent , therefore , an _",
    "asymptotic of the true flow .",
    "importantly , the duration of this intermediate asymptotic can be made arbitrary long if the average density of the gas is made sufficiently small compared with the close - packing density .",
    "furthermore , the appearance of singularities in the dilute - hydrodynamic solutions signals the formation of closely - packed clusters of particles .",
    "the details of formation and dynamics of the closely - packed regions are obviously beyond a dilute - gas hydrodynamic description . a satisfactory description of granular gases at moderate densities ( at a fraction of the close - packing density ) is provided by a navier - stokes granular hydrodynamics with the equation of state of carnahan and starling @xcite and semi - empiric transport coefficients derived from kinetic theory in the spirit of enskog approach @xcite .",
    "a hydrodynamic description at even higher densities is even more challenging , although some particular flow regimes at very high densities have been successfully described by using empirical constitutive relations @xcite and , when necessary , by taking into account a multi - phase character of the flow @xcite .",

    "we solved numerically a rescaled and transformed version of hydrodynamic equations eqs .",
    "( [ continuity])-([heat ] ) .",
    "the rescaling reduces considerably the number of relevant parameters , whereas the transformation dramatically reduces the computation time .",

    "importantly , a time - dependent cooling state with a stationary density in the original formulation corresponds to a _ true _ steady state , for _ all _ variables , in the transformed equations .",
    "two different hydrodynamic codes , vulcan/1d ( v1d ) and vulcan/2d ( v2d ) , were used for a numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ continuity_t])-([heat_t ] ) .",
    "the codes involve ale ( arbitrary lagrange - euler ) schemes on staggered grids and have both explicit and implicit solvers for hydrodynamics and heat conduction @xcite .",
    "v1d mainly works in the lagrangian mode and therefore can efficiently handle 1d density singularities .",
    "v2d is naturally limited to eulerian simulations .",
    "it can employ , however , a strongly non - uniform polar mesh .",
    "this feature of the code was very important when following the developing singularity in a circular container , see section [ hydrocircular ] .",
    "the two codes were previously tested against other codes and used for a variety of astrophysical problems , as well as for granular hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "as we have seen in subsection [ implications ] , heat diffusion is irrelevant for thermal collapse in 2d or 3d .",
    "let us check other assumptions that we made in order to derive the scaling relations for thermal collapse .",
    "when using ideal equations , we neglected the viscous heating term in the energy equation ( [ heat ] ) or ( [ heatp ] ) .",
    "the ratio of this term to the energy loss term can be estimated as @xmath216 therefore , for nearly elastic collisions ( that we assume throughout this work ) , the viscous heating remains small and , in the leading order , can be neglected .",
    "the validity of hydrodynamics itself at the density blowup demands that the knudsen number remains small , see eq .",

    ", the smallest hydrodynamic scale varies with time , in 2d , as @xmath217 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean free path of the gas varies as @xmath218 .",
    "therefore , @xmath219 and the applicability of hydrodynamics improves near the singularity .",
    "finally , we will check whether the pressure profile remains locally uniform near the singularity .",
    "this amounts to checking whether the correction @xmath220 , which we neglected in the perturbative expansion ( [ p_series ] ) , is indeed much smaller than the term @xmath221 . to evaluate @xmath222 we return to eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) and plug in it the ( supposedly leading - order ) quantities found in section [ scaling ] : @xmath223 let us estimate the terms on the right hand side .",
