    "relativistic jets pose many intriguing questions in astrophysics related to their formation process and the production mechanism of high energy particles and photons .",
    "the relativistic jet in the radio galaxy m87 is an excellent laboratory for investigating these issues ; because of its proximity ( @xmath9 16.7@xmath100.6 mpc ; @xcite ) and the large estimated mass of its central black hole ( @xmath11 ; @xcite ) , the black hole in m87 subtends the second largest angular size of any known black hole ( after sgr a * ) .    millimeter / submillimeter - wavelength vlbi is ideally suited to observing m87 on these scales , since the event - horizon - scale structure around the black hole is expected to become optically thin at @xmath12 230 ghz ( @xmath13 mm ) , based on the frequency - dependent position of the radio core @xcite and the existence of the sub - millimeter bump in its radio spectrum indicating the opacity transition at @xmath5 230 ghz @xcite .",
    "the origin of 230 ghz emission is still an unsettled question .",
    "the 230 ghz emission could be dominated by synchrotron emission from either the jet @xcite or the accretion disk @xcite in the regime of radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with low mass accretion rate of @xmath14 m@xmath15 y@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the position shift of the radio core along the jet direction at different frequencies @xcite provides strong evidence that the jet emission dominates the emission from the radio core at frequencies at least lower than 43 ghz ( = 7 mm ) .",
    "however , it is less clear for 230 ghz emission , since the extrapolated location of the 230 ghz radio core coincides with the jet base and/or central black hole within its uncertainty , and thus emission from the accretion disk could dominate .",
    "vlbi observations at such high frequencies ( @xmath13 mm , @xmath12 230 ghz ) have been technically challenging due to the limited sensitivity of the instruments , fast atmospheric phase fluctuations and the small number of stations available .",
    "recent technical developments ( e.g. phased - array processors , digital backends and recording systems with broad bandwidths ) and the addition of new ( sub)millimeter telescopes have led to a breakthrough to ( sub)millimeter vlbi observations .",
    "in particular , significant progress on 230 ghz vlbi observations has been achieved in the last few years with the event horizon telescope ( eht ; * ? ? ?",

    "these are naturally explained by recent theoretical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) schemes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "vlbi observations at 230 ghz can address at least two issues concerning the fundamental nature of m87 .",
    "the first is the event - horizon - scale structure of the jet launching region , which is crucial for understanding the formation process of the relativistic jets and also for testing the presence of signatures of strong - field gravitational lensing .",
    "geometric models including a shadow feature at the last photon orbit , illuminated by a counter jet and/or accretion disk in the close vicinity of the black hole , can be fit to current 230 ghz observations .",
    "these models produce a relatively dim central region encircled by a brighter annulus ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be properly imaged as the number of ( sub)millimeter vlbi sites increases @xcite .",
    "the second issue is the production mechanism of very - high - energy ( vhe ; @xmath18 @xmath5100 gev ) @xmath8-ray photons in the vicinity of the black hole and/or the jet base .",
    "m87 is one of only four known agns with weak or moderate beaming compared to other vhe agns , which mostly consist of bl lac objects .",
    "m87 has undergone three large vhe flares ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) and a weak vhe enhancement recently in march 2012 @xcite . in the past three flares ,",
    "the compact sizes of vhe emission region ( @xmath19 cm corresponding to a few @xmath6 , where @xmath20 is the doppler factor of the emission region ) are required by rapid variability timescales of @xmath51 d based on causality arguments . the vhe flares in 2008 and 2010 were followed by delayed strong and weak 43 ghz flux density enhancements , respectively , in the radio core at 43 ghz @xcite , indicating that these flares originate inside the radio core at 43 ghz only a few tens of @xmath6 downstream from the black hole and/or jet base @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a weak vhe enhancement in march 2012 ( hereafter the 2012 event ) has different properties compared to previous vhe flares .",
    "its long duration ( @xmath52 months ) and weak flux ( @xmath510 times weaker than the past three flares ) may point to an origin in a different type of vhe activity .",
    "multi - wavelength observations on milliarcsecond scales revealed strong enhancement in the radio core at both 22 and 43 ghz after the 2012 event , suggesting an origin close to the black hole and/or jet base , similar to the 2008 vhe flare ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h14 ) . in summary ,",
    "three of four previous vhe events are thought to originate in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "230 ghz vlbi is the ideal tool to constrain the location and structure of the vhe emission region .",

    "we find no evidence of significant changes in event - horizon - scale structure between the 2009 and 2012 observations .",
    "physically motivated structural models have been proposed for the schwarzschild - radius - scale structure at 230 ghz in m87 for both jet and disk models @xcite .",
    "although all proposed models predict the existence of a feature at the last photon orbit illuminated by a counter jet and/or accretion disk in the close vicinity of the black hole , there are significant differences between model images .",
    "the closure phase is an ideal tool to constrain physically motivated models , since relativistic effects such as gravitational lensing , light bending and doppler beaming generally induce asymmetric emission structure at the vicinity of the central black hole , causing the closure phase to be nonzero .",

    "230 ghz emission structure can be categorized into two types .",
    "one is the approaching - jet - dominated models , where emission from the approaching jet is predominant at 230 ghz @xcite .",
    "the model images consist of bright blob - like emission from the approaching jet and a weaker crescent or ring - like feature around the last photon orbit illuminated by a counter jet .",
    "the emission from the approaching jet dominates the 230 ghz emission regardless of the loading radius of non - thermal particles where leptons are accelerated and the jet starts to be luminous , although the crescent - like feature appears more clearly at smaller particle loading radii ( see figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in counter - jet - dominated models ,",
    "the counter - jet emission is predominant instead of the approaching jet .",
    "such a situation could happen if the bright emission region in the jet is very close to the central black hole ( within few @xmath17 ) suppressing the approaching jet emission due to gravitational lensing .",
    "photons from the counter jet illuminate the last photon orbit , forming a crescent - like feature .",
    "it is worth noting that @xcite and @xcite have clear differences in their images even at the same particle loading radius of a few @xmath17 , most likely due to differences in magnetic - field distribution and also the spatial and energy distribution of non - thermal particles in their models .",
    "the accretion disk models are well characterized by a crescent - like or ring - like feature around the last photon orbit .",
    "the 230 ghz emission arises in the inner portion of the accretion flow ( @xmath33 @xmath17 ) near the mid - plane .     as a function of greenwich sidereal time .",
    "the black solid - line shows an approaching - jet - dominated model @xcite fitted to 2009 data in @xcite ( broderick et al . in prep . ) .",

    "[ fig : cphase_avery ] ]    measured closure phases on the hawaii - arizona - california triangle are consistent with these three models . in figure",
    "[ fig : cphase_avery ] , we show the model closure phases calculated in the mit array performance simulator ( maps ) for an approaching - jet - dominated model , a counter - jet - dominated model and an accretion - disk - dominated model in figure [ fig : images ] .",
    "the closure phase of the approaching - jet - dominated model is almost zero . on the other hand , the model closure phases of",
    "counter - jet - dominated and accretion - disk - dominated models are systematically smaller than observed closure phase in the later gst range , but the models and observed closure phases are consistent within a 3-sigma level .",
    "we note that the results for counter - jet - dominated and accretion - disk - dominated models shown in figure 4 disagree with figure 9 of @xcite , due to a mistake in @xcite in constructing the closure phase triangles .",
    "all three models commonly predict small closure phases on the hawaii - arizona - california triangle .",
    "visibility phases on the arizona - california baseline , which barely resolves the source , are nearly zero .",
    "the closure phase on current vlbi triangles are almost same to differences in the visibility phase between long baselines between hawaii and the us mainland . for the case of the approaching - jet - dominated models , the phase gradient between long baselines is expected to be moderate particularly at large particle loading radii , since emission is blob - like and fairly symmetric on spatial scales corresponding to the current long baselines .",
    "models with a clear crescent - like or ring - like feature generally predict a steep phase gradient around the null amplitude region ( see figure [ fig : images ] ) , which would be detectable not on the current baselines but more longer baselines such as the hawaii - mexico baseline .",
    "the observed closure phases can not distinguish between models with different dominant origin of 230 ghz emission on the current vlbi triangle due to the large errors on the data points .",
    "however , future observations with a higher recording rate of 16 gbps can measure the closure phase with an accuracy within a few degrees at 1 minute integration , which can constrain physical models more precisely .",
    "in addition , models can be effectively distinguished by near future observations with additional telescopes such as the large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) in mexico or the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) in chile .",
    "differences in closure phases between models become more significant on larger triangles , as shown in the middle and bottom panels of figure [ fig : cphase_avery ] .    while all of the physically motivated models are broadly consistent with the currently measured closure phases and amplitudes , they make dramatically different predictions for forthcoming measurements .",
    "models in which the image is dominated by contributions close to the horizon ( counter - jet - dominated and accretion - disk - dominated models ) exhibit large closure phases on triangles that include the lmt in stark contrast to those dominated by emission further away ( approaching - jet - dominated ) .",
    "this extends to the visibility amplitudes : the compact emission models predict nulls on baselines probed by alma and the lmt ( see figure [ fig : images ] ) .      new vlbi observations of m87 at 230 ghz in 2012 confirm the presence of the event - horizon - scale structure reported in d12 .",

    "these brightness temperatures of @xmath41 k are below the upper cutoff in the intrinsic brightness temperature of @xmath42 k on the `` inverse compton catastrophe '' argument ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the 1.3 mm vlbi structure has been poorly constrained particularly n - s direction possibly inducing additional uncertainties , it is still instructive to discuss the effective brightness temperature and its physical implications for both the jet and accretion disk scenario .    in the case of the jet scenarios ,",
    "the brightness temperature would not be highly affected by the doppler beaming , and then not significantly differ from the intrinsic ( i.e. not doppler - boosted ) brightness temperature .",
    "the brightness temperature is amplified by a factor of @xmath20 for an isotropic blob - like source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , the 230 ghz brightness temperature is broadly consistent with the peak brightness temperature of @xmath47 k at the radio cores at lower frequencies from 1.6 ghz to 86 ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) @xmath49 the constant doppler factor and brightness temperature give the magnetic field strength roughly proportional to the observation frequency at the radio core ( i.e. @xmath50 ) . using the frequency - dependence of the radio core position ( @xmath51 ; * ? ? ?",

    "this profile also can be obtained if the longitudinal ( i.e. nearly poloidal ) field dominates the transverse ( i.e. nearly toroidal ) magnetic field along the paraboloidal stream under the flux frozen - in condition , although recent observations favor a conical stream of the jet in inner @xmath7 @xmath6 @xcite .    even though above assumptions might not work well for m87",
    ", this simple analysis suggests that the dominance of toroidal or poloidal magnetic fields starts to become a major concern on the jet formation in inner @xmath7 @xmath6 .",

    "* ) will provide more detailed structure of the radio core including the profile of the stream line , enabling more precise analysis on the magnetic field structure of the relativistic jet in m87 .",
    "the measurements of the brightness temperature also give some implications for the energetics of the jet base .",

    "our observations were performed in the middle of the vhe enhancement reported in @xcite and h14 .",
    "there are several observational pieces of evidence for the existence of a radio counterpart to the vhe enhancement around our observations .",
    "first , the onset of the radio brightening at 22 and 43 ghz occurs simultaneously with the vhe enhancement , indicating that the radio and vhe emission regions are not spatially separated .",
    "since the radio brightening starts @xmath5 20 - 30 days before our observations , 230 ghz emission is also expected to be enhanced at the epoch of our observations .",
    "the radio flux measured with the sma in h14 indeed shows a local maximum in its light curve during our observations , which is consistent with our results showing a radio flux greater than in april 2009 on arcsecond scales when m87 was in a quiescent state @xcite .",
    "second , the radio counterpart was not resolved in the radio core in vera observations , suggesting that the radio counterpart of the 2012 event should exist near the radio core at 43 ghz located at a few tens of schwarzschild radii downstream from the central black hole and/or the jet base visible at 230 ghz .",
    "the geometrical model ( described in  [ subsec : geometrical_models ] ) suggests that there are no obvious structural changes on event - horizon scales between 2009 and 2012 , despite the increase in the core flux on arcsecond scales .",
    "one plausible scenario for explaining the different behavior between event - horizon scales and arcsecond scales is that the structure of the flare component at 230 ghz has extended structure that is resolved out with the current array .",
    "the shortest vlbi baseline in our observations , smt - carma , has a length of 600 m@xmath58 .",
    "if we consider the gaussian - like structure for the flaring region with a radio flux of few @xmath59 100 mjy corresponding to the flux increment at the local peak in the 230 ghz light curve of h14 , the flaring region should be extended enough to have a correlated flux smaller than the standard deviation on smt - carma baselines of @xmath60 mjy so that the increment in the radio flux is not significantly detected on those baselines .",
    "the minimum fwhm size can be estimated to be @xmath61 @xmath30as @xmath62 @xmath17 , which has a hwhm size of @xmath63 m@xmath58 in the visibility plane .",
    "this limitation is consistent with at least two aspects of vhe flares .",
    "first , the 2-month duration of the 2012 vhe event implies that the size of the emission region is @xmath64 light days @xmath65 mas , from causality considerations .",
    "similar constraints of @xmath66 mas @xmath67 are provided with vera at 43 ghz in h14 , since the flare component was not spatially resolved during their observations . combining our measurement with these size limits , the vhe emission region size during our observations",
    "is constrained to be in the tight range of @xmath68 mas , corresponding to @xmath520 - 60 @xmath6 .",
    "second , when the emission region size is larger than @xmath5 20 @xmath6 , the emitted vhe photons will not be affected by absorption due to the process of photon - photon pair creation ( @xmath69-absorption ) . in principle ,",

    "<S> we report on 230 ghz ( 1.3 mm ) vlbi observations of m87 with the event horizon telescope using antennas on mauna kea in hawaii , mt . graham in arizona and cedar flat in california . for the first time </S>",
    "<S> , we have acquired 230 ghz vlbi interferometric phase information on m87 through measurement of closure phase on the triangle of long baselines . </S>",
    "<S> most of the measured closure phases are consistent with 0@xmath0 as expected by physically - motivated models for 230 ghz structure such as jet models and accretion disk models . </S>",
    "<S> the brightness temperature of the event - horizon - scale structure is @xmath1 k derived from the compact flux density of @xmath2 jy and the angular size of @xmath3 @xmath4as @xmath5 5.5 @xmath6 , which is broadly consistent with the peak brightness of the radio cores at 1 - 86 ghz located within @xmath7 @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> our observations occurred in the middle of an enhancement in very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath8-ray flux , presumably originating in the vicinity of the central black hole . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements , combined with results of multi - wavelength observations , favor a scenario in which the vhe region has an extended size of @xmath520 - 60 @xmath6 . </S>"
