    "circumstellar envelopes ( cse ) around tp - agb stars are active sites of complex physical processes .",
    "they involve the development of shock waves driven by long - period pulsations , the abundant formation of many different molecules , the condensation and growth of dust grains that , absorbing momentum from the radiation field and transferring it to the gas via collisions , are believed to be the key drivers of stellar winds at higher luminosities on the agb @xcite .",
    "indeed , the characterization of the chemistry across the cses of tp - agb stars has had an impressive progress in recent years thanks to the advent of radio and sub - millimeter telescopes at very high resolution and signal - to - noise ratio ( e.g. , herschel , alma ) .",
    "on observational grounds progress is proceeding mainly on two fronts .",
    "on one hand , the inventory of molecular species in resolved cses is lengthening with an increasing level of detail through studies devoted to specific objects .",
    "a striking case is provided by the carbon star irc+10216 , where more than 70 molecular species have been detected @xcite , while the dust - condensation zone is being resolved and probed thoroughly @xcite .",
    "other examples of well - studied stars which several chemical analyses have focused on are the oxygen star ik tau @xcite , and the s - type star @xmath6 cig @xcite .    on the other hand chemical studies , targeted to larger samples of agb stars , have been undertaken just recently .",
    "thanks to these works the available statistics are being importantly increased , allowing us to get the first insights on the dependence of the cse chemistry on relevant stellar parameters , such as the spectral type ( m , s , c ) , the pulsation period , and the rate of mass loss .",
    "information of this kind is now available for the circumstellar abundances of sio @xcite , sis @xcite , and hcn @xcite . as for h@xmath5o",
    ", we have measures for few m - type stars @xcite ; for carbon stars precise estimates are in most cases still missing , though the presence of h@xmath5o in significant concentrations is confirmed to be a widespread feature @xcite .    on theoretical grounds , most of the efforts are directed to analyze the chemical and physical characteristics of individual , resolved cses around agb stars .",
    "again , the case of the carbon star irc+10216 is definitely the most outstanding example , with a large number of theoretical studies dedicated to it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "all these works need to specify the input values for basic stellar parameters ,  such as the stellar mass @xmath7 , the pulsation period @xmath8 , the effective temperature @xmath9 , the photospheric radius @xmath10 , the density @xmath11 and the temperature @xmath12 at the shock formation radius , the photospheric c / o ratio , the mass - loss rate @xmath13 , etc . ,  which are usually derived or constrained from observations .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in all of these works these parameters refer to a particular object ( e.g. the carbon star irc+10216 , or the m star ik tau ) , at a particular stage of the agb evolution . clearly , the results of any ad - hoc chemo - dynamic model , able to reproduce ( within a given degree of accuracy ) a set of measured cse abundances for that star , represent an important test for the validation of the same model . at the same time , however , the specificity of the input assumptions does not allow to investigate the dependence of the cse chemistry on the stellar parameters as they vary during the tp - agb evolution .",
    "a first important step in the direction of extending the exploration of the parameters was performed by @xcite , who carried out an extensive analysis of the non - equilibrium chemistry in the inner pulsation - shocked cse at varying the photospheric c / o ratio , which was increased from c / o=0.75 to c / o=1.1 , to represent stars of types m , s , and c. @xcite explored the impact on the cse chemistry caused by a single quantity , i.e. the photospheric carbon abundance , while all other stellar parameters were kept fixed and equal to the values that are believed to best represent the case of the m star tx cam , i.e. @xmath14 k , @xmath15 , @xmath16 days , @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to make a further leap forward , for the first time connecting a chemo - dynamic model for cses to the stellar evolution during the tp - agb . in this way",
    "we will be able to follow the changes of the cse chemistry as a star evolves along the tp - agb varying its luminosity , radius , effective temperature , photospheric density , pulsation period , surface chemical composition due to convective mixing processes ( third dredge - up ) and hot - bottom burning ( for initial mass @xmath19 ) , while its mass decreases due to stellar winds . in a broader context ,",
    "coupling the tp - agb evolution of a star with the chemo - physical properties of its cse is a timely step that may importantly contribute to the far - reaching goal of attaining a comprehensive calibration of the tp - agb phase @xcite .    in this work we focus on the inner , warmer and denser , regions of the cse , where the shocks caused by stellar pulsations are thought to critically affect the dynamics and the chemistry . as a first application we will investigate the formation of the hydrogen cyanide molecule .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "the basic characteristics of the tp - agb stellar models are briefly recalled in sect .",
    "[ sect_tpagb ] .",
    "the adopted dynamic description together with the chemistry network are described in sect .",
    "[ sect_dyn ] . then , sect .",
    "[ sect_hcn ] is dedicated to present the results of the cse chemo - dynamic integrations applied to a selected grid of tp - agb evolutionary tracks , focusing on the abundances of hcn .",
    "we analyse the dependence on the main stellar and shock parameters , and discuss their calibration on the base of the measured hcn abundances for a populous sample of agb stars that includes all chemical types ( m , s , and c ) .",
    "the paper is closed with sect .",
    "[ sect_calibration ] , which outlines the major implications arising from the calibration , mainly in terms of the dynamic properties of the inner cses of agb stars .",
    "the evolution during the entire tp - agb phase , from the first thermal pulse up to the complete ejection of the envelope by stellar winds , is computed with the ` colibri ` code ( * ? ? ? * with updates as in @xcite and @xcite ) , to which the reader should refer for all the details . suffice to recall here the input physics and basic features of ` colibri",
    "` , that are relevant for the present work .",
    "the physical conditions at first thermal pulse are extracted from the ` parsec ` sets of evolutionary tracks @xcite . for the purposes of this work we adopt a solar - like initial chemical composition , with abundances ( in mass fraction ) of helium @xmath20 and metals @xmath21 .",
    "the initial chemical mixtures for metals is scaled - solar according to the @xcite .",
    "this assumption is suitable for comparing model predictions with observations of galactic agb stars ( see sect .",
    "[ sect_hcn ] ) .    `",
    "colibri ` is designed to optimize the ratio between computational issues ( mainly computing time requirements , and numerical instabilities due to the development of thermal pulses ) and physical accuracy . specifically , the kernel of ` colibri ` is a detailed _ deep _ envelope model , that includes the atmosphere and the convective mantle , and extends downward in mass to encompass the hydrogen burning shell . across this region",
    "numerical integrations of the four stellar structure equations are carried out at each time step , together with the on - the - fly computation of the equation of state and gas opacities , which ensures full consistency with the varying chemical composition .",
    "this latter is a unique feature of ` colibri ` which incorporates the ` sopus ` code @xcite as a subroutine to compute the concentrations of more than 800 species ( 300 atoms and 500 molecules ) for temperatures @xmath22 under the assumption of instantaneous chemical equilibrium , as well as the corresponding rosseland mean opacities due to many continuum absorptions , atomic and molecular line transitions , and scattering processes .",
    "figure [ fig_atmoeq ] displays a large number of atmosphere models , in terms of effective temperature @xmath9 and gas density at the photosphere @xmath23 , computed during the tp - agb evolution of stars with initial metallicity @xmath21 , and covering the range of initial masses from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . in general , models occupy a relatively wide region , with carbon stars extending to lower effective temperatures and lower gas densities compared to the oxygen - rich models .",
    "we emphasize that both @xmath9 and @xmath23 are key input parameters to the chemo - dynamic integrations of the circumstellar envelopes , described in sect .",
    "[ sect_dyn ] .",
    "[ sect_chemeq ]    due the severe uncertainties that still affect our knowledge of stellar convection and stellar winds , both processes are treated in ` colibri ` with a parametrized description , mainly in terms of the efficiencies of the third dredge - up and mass loss .",
    "it is common practice to adopt some analytical formula for the mass loss rate as a function of stellar parameters in stellar evolution models .",
    "doing so , we can then directly compare the modelled hcn abundance as a function of mass loss with observations .",
    "however , this practice generates an inconsistency in the present chemo - dynamic models of the wind of tp - agb stars , as we do not consider dust formation in the hcn formation zone and yet assume dust forms at a specific radius to generate a mass loss through radiation pressure on dust grains .",
    "mass loss is described assuming that it is caused by two main mechanisms , dominating at different stages .",
    "early on the agb , when stellar winds are likely related to magneto - acoustic waves operating below the stellar chromosphere , we adopt the semi - empirical relation by @xcite , modified according to @xcite . later on the agb ,",
    "when the star enters the dust - driven wind regime , we adopt an exponential form @xmath26 , as a function of stellar mass and radius , which yields results similar to those obtained with the mass - loss law of @xcite .",
    "the relation was calibrated on a sample of galactic long - period variables with measured mass - loss rates , pulsation periods , masses , effective temperatures , and radii . at any time on the tp - agb",
    ", the actual mass - loss rate is taken as the maximum among the two regimes .",
    "the onset of the third dredge - up is evaluated with the aid of envelope integrations at the stage of the post - flash luminosity peak , while its efficiency is computed with analytic fits to the results of full stellar models provided by @xcite , as a function of current stellar mass and metallicity . for the metallicity @xmath27 considered here , stellar models able to become carbon stars have initial masses @xmath28 .",
    "hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) in the most massive agb models ( @xmath29 ) is fully taken into account , with respect to both energetics and nucleosynthesis , adopting a complete nuclear network ( including the pp chains , cno , nena , and mgal cycles ) coupled to a diffusive description of stellar convection .",
    "in particular , with ` colibri ` we are able to follow in detail the evolution of the surface c / o ratio , which is known to have a dramatic impact on molecular chemistry , opacity , and effective temperature every time it crosses the critical region around unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". in turn , the surface c / o ratio plays a paramount role in determining the chemistry of dust in the cses of agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the high sensitivity of the atmospheric parameters to the surface c / o ratio",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_eqhcn ] .",
    "the gas pressure and the mass density at the photosphere ( at optical depth @xmath30 ) attain maximum values in the neighborhood of c / o@xmath31 , and then decrease on both sides , corresponding to oxygen - rich ( c / o@xmath32 ) and carbon - rich models ( c / o@xmath33 ) .",
    "the decrease is more pronounced in the models with lower effective temperatures . as for hcn , the sharp change in its abundance ( relative to that of h@xmath5 ) around c / o@xmath31 is even more dramatic , and the equilibrium concentration of this carbon - bearing molecule drops by orders of magnitude in the region characterised by c / o@xmath32 , while it rises notably in the opposite region defined by c / o@xmath33 .",
    "tp - agb stars are observationally classified in three groups ( m , s , and c ) , mainly on the base of the molecular absorption features that characterize their spectra .",
    "while m stars exhibit prominent molecular bands due to o - bearing molecules ( e.g. , vo , tio , h@xmath5o ) , c stars are dominated by strong bands of c - bearing molecules ( e.g. c@xmath5 , cn , hcn , c@xmath5 ) .",
    "s stars are distinguished by strong zro bands in addition to tio bands typical of m giant spectra . in the past",
    ", attempts were made to interpret the phenomenological criteria of spectral classification in terms of stellar parameters : photospheric c / o ratio , effective temperature , gravity , abundances of s - process elements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally believed that the c / o ratio is the key - factor that drives the spectral dichotomy between m stars ( c / o@xmath32 ) and c stars ( c / o@xmath33 ) . in this scheme s stars",
    "would be transition objects with c / o ratios within a very narrow range ( c / o@xmath34 ) . from a theoretical point of view , the increase of the c / o ratio is explained by the recurrent surface enrichment of primary carbon due to the third dredge - up at thermal pulses , which is also generally associated with the increase in the concentrations of heavy elements produced by slow - neutron captures , among which zr @xcite .    following the predictions of new model atmospheres ,",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out that the interval of c / o associated to s stars would be much wider than considered so far , that is @xmath35c / o@xmath36 .",
    "this is essentially because the characteristic zro bands observed in the spectra of s stars require that enough free oxygen , not locked in carbon monoxide and other o - bearing molecules , is available .    in the light of the above considerations , in this work we adopt the following operative definition to assign a given tp - agb stellar model to one for the three chemical classes :    * _ m stars _ :",
    "c / o@xmath37 , * _ s stars _ : @xmath38c / o@xmath36 , * _ c stars _ : c / o@xmath39 .    with this definition",

    "this model is expected to experience a complete chemical evolution regulated by the photospheric c / o ratio , starting from the m class , transiting through the s class , and eventually reaching the c class where major mass loss takes place . at the transition to the c - star domain ,",
    "most of the variables exhibit a notable change in their mean trends , which results into a decrease of the effective temperature and of the photospheric density , an increase of the pulsation period , and an intensification of the mass - loss rate .",
    "the bottom panels present the photospheric concentrations of h@xmath5 and hcn , derived with the ` sopus ` code under the assumption of instantaneous chemical equilibrium .",
    "as already discussed above , the molecule of hydrogen cyanide is critically affected by the evolution of the c / o ratio .",
    "further modulations in the hcn and h@xmath5 abundances are driven by the quasi - periodic occurrence of thermal pulses , clearly recognizable in the oscillating trends on timescales of the inter - pulse period ( see also sect .",
    "[ ssect_tpcycle ] ) .",
    "several theoretical studies clearly pointed out that the strong pulsations experienced by agb stars cause periodic shock waves to emerge from sub - photospheric regions , whence they propagate outward through the stellar atmosphere and the circumstellar envelope @xcite . to model the shock dynamics and the non - equilibrium chemistry across the circumstellar region that extends from the photosphere at @xmath41 to @xmath42 , which we refer to as `` inner wind ''",

    "[ fig_hcndata ] , where the estimated hcn abundances are plotted as a function of the mass - loss rate for the three chemical types .",

    "as expected , the equilibrium abundance of hcn is remarkably sensitive to the c / o ratio .",
    "as long as the star remains oxygen - rich with c / o@xmath183 , the hcn concentration is quite low and decreases significantly while moving away from the stellar photosphere ( left panel of fig .",

[ fig_ice ] ) underlines that even in the most favorable conditions of high gas density , the predicted @xmath180 for m and s stars ( @xmath184 ) is already much lower than the observed data by few orders of magnitude .    as the c / o ratio increases due to the third dredge - up events and enters the critical narrow range regime @xmath185 c / o @xmath186 the equilibrium abundances of hcn abruptly rise , spanning a remarkably wide range .",

    "eventually , as soon as the star becomes carbon rich ( c / o @xmath60 ) a remarkable increase of the hcn abundances ( by several order of magnitudes ) takes place and the predicted equilibrium abundances reach values that appear to be consistent with the measured data for carbon stars , starting from @xmath191 .",
    "in view of the above , we may conclude that the ice chemistry is not suitable for explaining the observations of hcn in the cses of agb stars with different chemical types , as already mentioned by @xcite .      in the following we will analyse the hcn abundances predicted by calculations of non - equilibrium chemistry regulated by the occurrence of pulsation - induced shocks which propagate across the cse .",

    "a few considerations can be drawn .",
    "for all three values @xmath196 the hcn concentrations are always below the measured data at any value of the photospheric c / o ratio .",
    "the theoretical underestimation is more pronounced for the m and s stars , amounting to several orders of magnitudes . in all cases",
    "the radial profile of hcn abundance is characterised by large variations , which explains the sizable scatter of the predictions over a distance range @xmath197 , at a given mass - loss rate .",
    "a significant improvement of the model - data comparison is obtained when lowering the effective adiabatic index to @xmath198 .",
    "we note that lowering @xmath1 from 1.1 to 1.01 produces a large increase of @xmath180 for m and s models .",
    "such a dramatic change is related to the evolution of temperature and density during the post - shock relaxation , which affects the hcn formation through the h@xmath5/h ratio ( see the extensive discussion in sect .  [ ssect_hcn ] ) .",
    "when @xmath1 is relatively high , the higher temperature at early phases destroys / prevents the formation of h@xmath5 , whereas at later phases ( when the temperature would be suitable for h@xmath5 formation ) , the rate of h@xmath5 formation is low because of the low density reached during the post - shock relaxation .",
    "when @xmath1 is close to one ( radiative shocks ) , the cooling is so efficient that the temperature is suitable for h@xmath5 formation at almost all phases .    adopting @xmath199",
    "the predicted hcn abundances over the @xmath197 radial distance and during the tp - agb evolution match the observed data points very well .",
    "in particular , the model recovers the observed stratification of the hcn concentrations that are seen to increase , on average , when moving along the chemical sequence of m , s , and c stars .",
    "this result supports the empirical fact that the photospheric c / o ratio is one of the major factors determining the cse chemistry of hcn , and is at variance with previous conclusions @xcite .",
    "moreover , we note that for @xmath198 the theoretical dispersion of the hcn abundances becomes quite narrow at varying radial distance in the @xmath197 interval .",
    "this finding means that the shock - chemistry for hcn tends to freeze out at increasing distance ( see also the left panel fig .",
    "[ fig_hcn_rad ] ) , and is consistent with the observational evidence that the hcn concentrations attain typical values which do not change dramatically , especially within a given chemical class of mass - losing agb stars .    in conclusion",
    ", our tests suggest that in order to explain the cse concentrations of hcn in the framework of the non - equilibrium chemistry , the pulsation - induced shocks in the inner zone around agb stars should be described by a low value of the effective adiabatic index , that is @xmath199 .",
    "it is quite interesting to interpret this finding in terms of physical implications .",
    "if radiative processes are not important , @xmath1 is determined by thermodynamic equilibrium of the gas . for instance , for a gas mostly consisting of hydrogen , @xmath200 for atomic hydrogen , @xmath201 for molecular hydrogen without vibrational degrees , @xmath202 for molecular hydrogen with vibrations excited @xcite .",
    "deviations toward lower values for @xmath1 may actually occur if radiative processes become significant in the thermal relaxation behind the propagating shock waves , so that the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium can not be safely applied .    an indication that this may indeed be the case for mira variables was derived by @xcite from their model fits to the observed co @xmath203 excitation temperature as a function of the phase for four stars ( o ceti , t cep , @xmath6 cyg , r cas ) . in all cases they obtained @xmath204 .    in this context ,",
    "@xcite provided a thorough discussion about the character of the thermal relaxation behind the shock , which is critically affected by the time scale necessary for the gas to radiate away its excess of internal energy dissipated by the shock . in brief , the thermal behavior of the gas in the cses of pulsating stars depends on the comparison between the radiative cooling time scale @xmath205 and the stellar pulsation period @xmath8 :    * if @xmath206 then the gas can not radiate away the energy dissipated by one shock within one pulsation period , and therefore it cools adiabatically . + * if @xmath207 the gas quickly relaxes to radiative equilibrium behind the shock before the next shock wave hits it , so that the dominant character is that of an isothermal shock .",
    "on the temperature - density diagram one can conveniently define a `` critical cooling track '' along which the maximum radiative cooling time is @xmath208 yr , considering one year as a typical period of a mira variable .",
    "two such critical lines are drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig_rho2t2 ] according to the computations of @xcite , for two choices of the radiation temperature , i.e. @xmath209 k ( dashed line ) , and @xmath210 k ( solid line ) .",
    "gas elements that are shocked to the left of the critical cooling tracks can reestablish radiative equilibrium before the next shock arrives ( dominant isothermal character ) , those which are shocked to the right of the critical cooling track will be hit by the next shock before radiative equilibrium can be achieved ( dominant adiabatic character ) .",
    "we notice that the post - shock values of temperature @xmath130 and density @xmath131 predicted with our shock models typically lie in the region where @xmath207 . as a consequence",
    ", we expect that the periodic shocks that hit the gas in the high - density inner circumstellar envelope ( within few r ) present a dominant isothermal character .    in the framework of the shock formalism adopted in the present study , isothermality corresponds to assuming a low value for @xmath1 , close to unity , which is in excellent agreement with the findings we have derived from the analysis of the hcn concentrations just discussed above .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the isothermal character of the shocks which emerge in the inner zone of the cses , derived from the detailed physical modelling of @xcite , nicely provides a physically independent support to our calibration analysis which is , instead , based on an purely chemistry - related ground .",
    "the shock formation radius @xmath0 is another critical parameter of our chemo - dynamic model , since it determines the boundary between the static region and the pulsation - shocked region in the extended atmosphere , across which the average pre - shock density profile is expected to decrease with two quite different scale - heights , as described in sect .",
    "[ ssect_rho ] .",
    "since the static scale - height @xmath211 is shorter than the dynamic scale - height @xmath212 by a factor @xmath213 , it is clear that the farther the location @xmath0 , the lower the densities in the pulsation - shocked region .",
    "the density , in turn , affects the integration of the non - equilibrium chemistry network , hence the concentrations of the different species .",
    "studies of pulsation - shocked chemistry dealing with the cse chemistry of individual agb stars , which are based on the @xcite formalism for the density , locate the shock formation radius at typical distances @xmath214 @xcite .    on the theoretical ground , early numerical models of pulsating atmospheres @xcite",

    "instead , the comparison is satisfactory for c stars .",
    "the main reason for the discrepancy that affects the m and s models should be ascribed to the gas densities that are too low across the pulsation - shocked region . on the other hand , a very nice agreement for all chemical classes , that is at increasing photospheric c / o ratio from below to above unity ,",

    "the difference depends on the exact stellar parameters , but is always quite large , and should persist at larger distances .    in summary , our tests indicate that the non - equilibrium shock chemistry in the inner cses can account for the measured hcn abundances , provided that the first shock emerges quite close to the star , already from the photospheric layers .",
    "it is encouraging to realize that this stringent finding , derived from a chemistry - based calibration , is in line with other independent analyses carried out both on theoretical and observational grounds . indeed ,",
    "current detailed models of pulsating atmospheres for mira variables indicate that pulsation - driven shocks form in the deep atmosphere , even below the photosphere , whence they propagate outward @xcite .",
    "observational support to an inner atmospheric origin of the shocks comes from the velocity and temperature structures derived from the vibration - rotation co @xmath203 emission lines , which are consistent with the development of shock waves originating deeper than the line forming layers @xcite .",
    "likewise , studies based on envelope tomography of long period variables suggest that the double absorption lines in their optical spectra are caused by the propagation of a shock wave through the photosphere @xcite .",
    "we will discuss here the major chemistry channels involved in the formation of the hcn molecule across the shocked inner cse .",
    "the chemo - dynamic integrations are carried out with the best - fitting parameters , @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "figure  [ fig_hcn_rad ] ( left panel ) neatly shows that the hcn abundances do depend on their photospheric c / o ratio . for any given c / o , after an initial decrease down to a minimum ( much more pronounced for m - stars ) in the region very close to the star ,",
    "the hcn concentration starts increasing from @xmath244 until it reaches a well - defined value which remains almost constant at larger distances .",
    "the level of the plateau is seen to systematically increase moving through the domains of m stars ( c / o@xmath245 ) , s stars ( @xmath246c / o@xmath247 ) , and c stars ( c / o@xmath39 ) .",
    "this finding is in contrast with the analysis of @xcite , who predicted the presence of hcn in large quantities for any c / o ratios .",
    "that circumstance was ascribed to the `` very fast chemistry '' occurring in a very narrow region just after the shock front itself , as described by @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was suggested that the formation of cn , the radical responsible for the bulk of hcn , should mainly take place in the fast chemistry region at @xmath248 via the reaction : @xmath249 and the radical ch should be simultaneously produced close to the shock front by @xmath250 the latter reaction has a very high energy activation barrier , which prevents efficient formation of ch far from the shock front .",
    "this would imply that the production of hcn is essentially controlled by the physical conditions of the gas in proximity of the shock front , hence being almost insensitive to the photospheric c / o ratio .    in any case",
    ", our calculations point at a different conclusion compared to the study of @xcite . as an illustrative case , we will analyse the results obtained for the shock chemistry of an oxygen - rich cse characterized by a photospheric c / o@xmath251 ( fig .  [ fig_veryfast ] ) .",
    "the stellar parameters refer to the quiescent stage just prior the @xmath252 thermal pulse experienced by a star with initial mass @xmath253 , metallicity @xmath27 . in this respect",
    "it is worth examining the evolution of the h@xmath5 , cn and hcn concentrations that results from both the `` very fast chemistry '' at the shock front , and the chemistry during the subsequent post - shock relaxation phase .",
    "for all three molecules our models show ( left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_veryfast ] ) that the `` very fast chemistry '' is not efficient at small radial distances , @xmath254 , where the thickness @xmath161 of the cooling layer is very small ( see sect .",
    "[ ssect_integration ] ) . at larger radii , @xmath255 ,",
    "the trends are different .",
    "the concentration of h@xmath5 is expected to decrease for @xmath256 , while a significant increase of cn takes place already starting from @xmath257 outward .",
    "the hcn concentration is little changed compared to the pre - shock value , at each distance .",
    "we find that in the `` very fast chemistry '' zone the two reactions that are mainly responsible for the production / destruction of the cn molecule are @xmath258 and @xmath259 respectively .",
    "both reactions are also the major processes involved in the chemistry of hcn at the shock front . at this stage",
    "we can not provide a precise reason for the differences between our results and those of @xcite , as they are the combined result of different input stellar and shock parameters .",
    "we just note that the adoption of a low effective adiabatic exponent @xmath198 leads to lower post - shock temperatures , so that reactions with high energy activation barrier , e.g. , reaction  [ r_h_c2 ] , are not efficient .",
    "let us now move to examine the results of the chemistry during the post - shock excursion ( right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_veryfast ] ) .",
    "here the trends appear opposite compared to the `` very fast chemistry '' .",
    "in particular , we note that the concentration of h@xmath5 starts to increase steeply at inner radii , @xmath260 , quickly reaching a plateau that corresponds to the condition in which almost all hydrogen atoms are locked into h@xmath5 .",
    "the chemistry of h@xmath5 has a dramatic impact on the abundance of hcn .",
    "after an initial drop in the inner regions , the hcn concentration increases suddenly by a notable amount , just where h@xmath5 attains its maximum concentration , at @xmath244 .",
    "then , hcn levels off at @xmath261 , which is maintained across larger distances .    to understand the trends just described , it is useful to compare the main times - scales involved .",
    "we denote with @xmath262 the flow dynamical time - scale , where @xmath45 is the position in the flow , and @xmath263 is the local flow velocity ( see fig .  [ fig_rtau ] ) . for any given molecule @xmath143",
    ", we also define the chemical time - scale for destruction @xmath264 the chemical time - scale for production @xmath265 where , for simplicity , the chemical fluxes for destruction @xmath266 , and production @xmath267 [ @xmath268 s@xmath120 ] are shown in the case of two - particle collisions with generic rate @xmath270 [ @xmath271 s@xmath120 ]",
    ". clearly all the reactions of the chemistry network , that are involved in the production / destruction of a given molecule , must be considered in the actual computation of the chemical fluxes .    as for hcn",
    "we derive two main points .",
    "first , in the interval @xmath272 , at any phase during the post - shock gas expansion , @xmath273 and both ( @xmath274 , @xmath275 .",
    "this means that the hcn abundance is in chemical equilibrium during the post - shock relaxation , which is defined by the exact balance of the chemical fluxes , @xmath276 .",
    "second , the main chemical channels that keep hcn in equilibrium are reactions  ( [ r_hcn_h ] ) and ( [ r_cn_h2 ] ) , so that the equilibrium concentration of hcn can be well approximated with : @xmath277 where @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 are the number densities [ @xmath268 ] of the involved molecules .",
    "similarly , the cn molecule attains its equilibrium concentration , corresponding to the balance of the chemical fluxes , that is @xmath282    it is clear from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_hcneq ] ) - ( [ eq_cneq ] ) that the equilibrium abundances of hcn and cn are critically dependent , in opposite way , on the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen , @xmath283 .",
    "it is therefore important to analyse the behaviour of molecular hydrogen during the post - shock relaxation , at increasing distance form the star .",
    "figure  [ fig_h2_hcn_phi ] ( top panels ) displays the evolution of the ratio @xmath284 $ ] as a function of the pulsation phase during the post - shock expansion of a fluid element that is hit by a shock at increasing distance from the star . comparing the results obtained with the non - equilibrium chemistry network ( left panel ) and with the assumption of ice of all species ( right panel )",
    ", we see that in both cases at given distance ( along each line ) a rapid increase of @xmath285 takes place in the very initial phases , followed by a steady decrease during the following post - shock expansion .",
    "this trend is reversed at larger distances , where almost hydrogen atoms become trapped into h@xmath5 and @xmath286 during the entire post - shock relaxation , at any phase . in this respect",
    "the major difference is that while in the non - equilibrium chemistry case the quantity @xmath285 reaches unity already quite close to the star ( @xmath255 ) when the gas density is still relatively high , under the ice condition molecular hydrogen is efficiently formed farther from the star ( @xmath287 ) , so that @xmath286 in regions where the density has already dropped considerably .",
    "the evolution of the hcn abundance reflects such a difference in the evolution of h@xmath5 ( bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_h2_hcn_phi ] ) . in the case of the non - equilibrium chemistry",
    "as soon as @xmath286 is attained , the concentration of hcn steeply increases leveling out at @xmath288 , which is kept constant at larger radii , independently of the phase .",
    "conversely , in the ice case the condition @xmath289 is reached only at longer distances , in low - density regions where the cn abundance is quite low .",
    "hence the concentration of hcn keeps on decreasing as the shock propagates outward .    at this point , it is necessary to consider the shock chemistry of h - h@xmath5 in more detail . examining the time - scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig_rtau ] ) and the chemical fluxes involved we find that in the inner part , @xmath290 , the h@xmath5 abundance reaches a condition of chemical equilibrium , but the main reactions that contribute to @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( eqs .  [ eq_des]-[eq_prod ] ) change with increasing distance , according to the sequence : @xmath291 @xmath292 @xmath293 @xmath294    figure  [ fig_nr ] shows the radial abundance profiles of the involved species ( h , o , h@xmath5 , oh , h@xmath5o , cn , and hcn ) obtained connecting the results soon after the completion of two pulsation periods ( at phase @xmath295 ) at each mesh point of the spatial grid .",
    "similar plots can be built at other phases . in general",
    ", one should be aware that radial abundance profiles obtained connecting loci of equal phases may differ depending on the selected pulsation phase .",
    "this is evident , for instance , looking at fig .",
    "[ fig_h2_hcn_phi ] .",
    "however , observations are compared with the predicted hcn abundances that are reached in the freeze - out region ( @xmath296 ) where the phase dependence disappears .",
    "it is evident that the predictions from the non - equilibrium chemistry ( left panel ) are quite different from the ice results .",
    "the passage of shocks favours the efficient formation of h@xmath5 in regions closer to the star , compared to the ice case ( right panel ) . at @xmath297 already @xmath298 of h atoms",
    "are locked in molecular hydrogen according to the non - equilibrium chemistry integrations , while in condition of instantaneous equilibrium chemistry the fraction of molecular hydrogen is much less , @xmath299 , and increases to @xmath300 at larger distances , from @xmath287 .    in the non - equilibrium case",
    "the condition @xmath289 is reached at @xmath297 just where the abundance of water @xmath301 also rises and quickly levels out to a maximum value . at this point reaction  ( [ r_3 ] ) overtakes reaction  ( [ r_2 ] ) as main chemical channel for the production / destruction of h@xmath5 , and the ratio of molecular - to - atomic hydrogen is well approximated with @xmath302 all this concurs to produce a steep increase of the hcn equilibrium concentration at @xmath297 , which appears clearly in figs .",
    "[ fig_hcn_rs0 ] , [ fig_veryfast ] , [ fig_h2_hcn_phi ] , and [ fig_nr ] . for @xmath191 , the fractional concentration @xmath180 remains roughly invariant while @xmath286 , and eventually the condition of chemistry freeze - out is reached when the gas density and temperature drop and the dynamical time - scale becomes shorter than chemical time - scale for molecular hydrogen ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_rtau ] ) .",
    "completely different results are obtained under the ice assumption ( right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig_nr ] ) : the fractional abundances of hcn and cn exhibit a steadily decreasing trend across the cse quickly sinking to extremely low values .    in conclusion",
    "our analysis shows that a proper treatment of the h - h@xmath5 chemistry in the inner shocked cse during the post - shock relaxation stages is critical for the abundances of hcn and cn .",
    "in particular , the ice assumption is inadequate and leads to a systematic under - estimation of the hcn concentration , at least for the chemical mixtures characterized by c / o@xmath65 .",
    "the results discussed in the previous sections apply to the quiescent tp - agb evolution , so that each envelope integration corresponds to the stellar parameters at the stage just prior the development of a thermal pulse .",
    "however , stellar models show that the tp - agb phase can not be represented only by quiescent stages , since the quasi - periodic occurrence of thermal instabilities of the he - burning shell cause significant variations of the stellar structure , modulating the evolution of the luminosity according to a typical profile that is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig_pulse ] .",
    "denoting with @xmath303 the inter - pulse period between two consecutive he - shell flashes , we define the phase over a thermal pulse - cycle as @xmath304 , where @xmath305 is the time counted from the occurrence of a flash ( @xmath306 ) up to the stage just prior the next one ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig_pulse ] , we see that during the first stages of a thermal pulse - cycle , a tp - agb star is expected to have luminosities that may be much fainter than the quiescent values at @xmath308 , due to the low nuclear activity , or even extinction , of the h - burning shell .",
    "the duration of these dimmer stages becomes longer for decreasing stellar mass , and it can cover up to 30 - 40@xmath309 of the inter - pulse periods in tp - agb stars with masses @xmath310@xcite .",
    "it follows that the statistical significance of the post - flash sub - luminous phase  known with the global term of `` low - luminosity dip '' , can not be neglected in terms of detection probability .    during the low - luminosity dip",
    "the star is characterized by significant variations of all other physical quantities , namely higher effective temperatures @xmath9 , shorter pulsation periods @xmath311 , and lower mass - loss rates @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig_pulse ] shows the evolution of these quantities over the @xmath252 , @xmath312 , and @xmath313 thermal pulse - cycle experienced by a tp - agb model with initial mass @xmath314 and metallicity @xmath21 .    since @xmath315 , @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath13 are the key input parameters of the present chemo - dynamic model for the inner cse , it is worth exploring the effect of the pulse - driven variations of the stellar structure on the pulsation - shocked chemistry of hcn .",
    "to this aim we applied the chemo - dynamic integrations for ten values of the pulse - cycle phase , from @xmath316 to @xmath317 .",
    "figure  [ fig_pulse ] provides an example of how the stellar parameters evolve , together with the resulting hcn non - equilibrium abundances in the inner cse , during three complete thermal pulse - cycles .",
    "the pulses were selected to form a sequence of increasing photospheric c / o ratio ( 0.43 , 0.74 , and 1.31 ) so as to represent the three chemical classes of m , s , and c stars .",
    "we note that , indeed , the hcn concentrations are affected by the occurrence of thermal pulses . in the case with @xmath318 , the hcn abundance is seen to increase during the initial pulse - cycle phases up to maximum value reached at @xmath319 , and then it decreases at later phases up to the completion of the inter - pulse period . for the models with @xmath320 0.74 , 1.31 the trends",
    "are reversed , as the hcn concentrations reach a minimum at @xmath321 and then increase for remaining part the thermal - pulse cycle .",
    "other test calculations were carried out for a few selected thermal pulses of tp - agb models that are expected to undergo the transitions to the chemical types m@xmath322s@xmath322c , following the increase of the photospheric c / o ratio caused by the third dredge - up events .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chempulse ] for six choices of the initial stellar mass , @xmath323 .",
    "the variations of the hcn concentrations over a thermal pulse cycle contribute to the observed scatter of the data belonging to the three chemical classes m , s , and c. it is also worth noticing that the evolution of the hcn abundances covers a relatively wide interval of mass - loss rates , while it remains well inside the concentration boundaries of the three chemical types drawn by the measured data .",
    "for instance , over the @xmath324 pulse cycle experienced by the @xmath325 tp - agb model , the corresponding hcn track performs a wide excursion in terms of the mass - loss rate  ranging from @xmath326 to @xmath327  , and the predicted abundances are in excellent agreement with the observed location of the c - star data .",
    "the present work has , for the first time , coupled the evolution of a star during the tp - agb phase to the non - equilibrium molecular chemistry that is expected to be active in the inner pulsation - shocked zone of its circumstellar envelope .    to model the chemo - dynamic properties of the shocked gas in the region that extends from the stellar photosphere to a few stellar radii",
    ", we adopted the main scheme developed by @xcite , but introducing a few important changes .",
    "the purpose is to provide an approach that is able to handle more general cases ( i.e. with all stellar parameters that vary along a tp - agb track ) and to assure a higher level of self - consistency . in this respect , we performed the following steps .    * first , we relax the common assumption of a constant shock parameter @xmath88 , which was assigned a value of 0.89 in several past studies . since @xmath88 actually fixes the extended scale height for the pre - shock density profile in the shocked region , its value",
    "is now determined with the aid of a suitable continuity condition for the density at the dust condensation radius . in practice",
    ", the boundary condition involves finding the zero of a function in which all stellar parameters are involved . in this way @xmath88",
    "is naturally predicted to vary during the tp - agb evolution . *",
    "second , once @xmath88 is known , the maximum shock amplitude @xmath111 follows straightforwardly from the definition @xmath328 . in past studies ,",
    "@xmath111 was often chosen independently from @xmath88 .",
    "we find that @xmath111 anti - correlates with the pulsation period , in close agreement with detailed models of pulsation - shocked atmospheres for agb stars .",
    "moreover , our predictions for the pre - shock radial profiles of the gas density and temperature compare nicely with the time - averaged spatial gradients derived by state - of - the - art dynamic atmosphere models for pulsating , mass - losing agb stars . *",
    "third , we take the remaining two shock parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , as free quantities to be calibrated on the base of the hcn abundances measured in the cses of a populous sample of agb stars of types m , s , and c. following the several tests made with different choices of the shock parameters , we eventually obtain a chemistry - based calibration of our dynamic model .",
    "the calibrated parameters are used to compute a large number of chemo - dynamic integrations of the inner cses , suitably tailored to an extended grid of tp - agb evolutionary models .",
    "these provide the initial conditions to the cse models in terms of key stellar properties : @xmath7 , @xmath315 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 , @xmath23 , and surface chemical composition , including the c / o ratio and the equilibrium molecular chemistry at the photosphere . in this way a large variety of stellar conditions can be investigated .",
    "the calibration procedure is successful and yields a nice agreement with the observed hcn abundances .",
    "figure  [ fig_hcn_allmod ] presents a a comprehensive plot that includes many predicted values of the hcn concentrations in the inner cses , which correspond to models with different stellar masses and evolutionary stages during the tp - agb .",
    "our models recover the observed variation of the data as a function of the chemical type .    from the chemo - dynamic calibration we derive important implications , which are summarised below .      * in order to have suitably high densities needed to account for the observed hcn data , the shock formation radius should be located in the innermost zones of the cse .",
    "the best results are obtained assuming @xmath329 , which suggests that the shock waves caused by pulsation should emerge very close to the stellar photosphere .",
    "this finding is supported by observational and theoretical independent studies . * in the inner and denser zones of the cses , the shocks should exhibit a dominant isothermal character .",
    "it means that during the post - shock relaxation phase the gas temperature cools primarily by emission of radiation . in our formalism",
    "this condition corresponds to assuming low values for the effective adiabatic index , specifically @xmath199 .",
    "this indication is also in line with other independent findings obtained on empirical and theoretical grounds ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig_rho2t2 ] ) .      * the instantaneous chemical equilibrium ( ice ) assumption",
    "is clearly violated in the shocked regions and is definitely inadequate to explain the measured hcn concentrations . in particular , in the cases of m and s stars the ice predictions underestimate the abundances by several order of magnitudes . in this respect",
    "we confirm , on a larger base of stellar parameters , the indications from past chemical studies . *",
    "our analysis suggests that the hcn abundance is critically linked to the h@xmath5-h chemistry during the post - shock relaxation phases , rather than to the `` very fast chemistry '' in the thin cooling layer as suggested by @xcite .",
    "* the calibrated models successfully account for the observed range of hcn abundances and measured mass - loss rates , extending up to both the minimum and maximum hcn values .",
    "the agreement supports the soundness of the underlying tp - agb models in terms of c / o enrichment , evolution of effective temperature , pulsation period , stellar mass and radius , as well as to the appropriateness of the temperature , density , and gas velocity profiles across the pulsation - shocked region .",
    "* we account for the variation of the hcn abundances as a function of the chemical type neatly indicated by the observations of @xcite , with the mean values that increase along the sequence m - s - c . in this respect",
    "we do not confirm the almost independence of hcn from the photospheric c / o ratio suggested by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the models with @xmath330c / o@xmath247 are found to cover a broader range hcn concentrations , a feature that the measured data for s stars also show .",
    "* we investigate the effects on the non - equilibrium chemistry due to the variations of the stellar structure driven by occurrence of thermal pulses .",
    "we find that the hcn concentrations may change significantly over a thermal - pulse cycle , contributing to the observed dispersion of the measured hcn data as function of the mass - loss rates .",
    "we are aware of various limitations of our model , and are currently working on several improvements that will be addressed in follow - up works .",
    "these involve the assumption that fluid elements move on closed trajectories , the chemical effects of dust formation , and in general the chemical network we are employing in this work . here",
    "we shortly discuss these limitations , and why we believe that they can be safely neglected in the framework of this paper .",
    "the chemical network used in this paper was originally developed by @xcite in order to model the c star irc+10216 . while it includes many reactions about o - bearing species , it is however possible that the network omits some reactions that are important for the chemistry of o - rich ( m ) stars .",
    "we are currently checking this aspect , and a revised / expanded network will be presented in a future paper . here , it suffices to explore qualitatively the potential consequences upon the results of the present study .",
    "we start from the basic consideration that hcn is a c - bearing species .",
    "observations show that hcn abundances increase , on average , moving along the spectral sequence m - s - c ( see fig .  [ fig_hcndata ] ) , which indicates that the formation hcn is strongly related with the amount of c that is not locked in co molecules . in c",
    "stars its abundance can reach values of the order of @xmath331 , whereas in m stars hcn can only involve a residual ( tiny ) amount of c , and its concentration is typically much lower , @xmath332 .",
    "therefore , our naive expectation is that the addition of chemical species / reactions involving o - bearing species ( e.g. , a channel for the formation of water through ionic reactions ) to the chemical network we used would not affect our results for c stars at all .",
    "instead , in m ( and , to a lesser extent , s ) stars , such addition might have an indirect effect : if a larger fraction of o atoms end up in o - bearing species ( e.g. water ) , the abundance of co should decrease a bit compared to the value we calculated in our models . in turn , this should increase the amount of c that is available for other c - bearing species , such as hcn .",
    "were this the case , reproducing the observed distribution of hcn abundances would require to change the dynamical parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath88 , and @xmath0 .",
    "however , we expect such changes to be relatively small , otherwise we would lose the nice consistency of the dynamical picture obtained in this work , in particular with the respect to the inner formation and the isothermal character of the shocks .",
    "the model described in this paper does not account for the effects of dust formation on the chemical budget : in fact , the metals that condense into dust grains are no more available for gas - phase chemistry ( thus , at @xmath333 we expect a significant depletion of si and o in oxygen - rich stars , and of c in carbon - rich stars ) ; furthermore , the very presence of dust might catalyze some reactions ( e.g. h@xmath5 formation * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "however , the hcn chemistry should be essentially unaffected by these inconsistencies .",
    "the reason is that in the majority of the cases we consider ( i.e. for most of the tp - agb evolution ) , dust formation takes place outside the region where the hcn abundance is changing .",
    "in fact , we generally have @xmath334 for c stars , and @xmath335 for m and s stars ( see e.g. fig . 8) , whereas the hcn abundance freezes out at @xmath336 in c stars , and at @xmath337 in m and s stars ( see , e.g. , fig .  [ fig_hcn_rad ] ) .",
    "thus , we believe that dust formation will not impact on the final abundances of hcn .",
    "a further concern is that the newly condensed dust is likely to accelerate the stellar wind , thus taking the lagrangian trajectories of fluid elements further away from our idealized assumption of strict periodicity with zero mass loss .",
    "however , first we note that through distances @xmath338 the acceleration remains quite moderate , as can be seen in fig . 8 :",
    "for example , at @xmath339 typical wind velocities are @xmath340 km / s , corresponding to a relative displacement @xmath341 .",
    "more importantly , for @xmath342 fluid motions take place already in the freeze - out region , so that inaccuracies in the description of the lagrangian trajectories are not expected to produce significant effects on the hcn abundances .    as for future developments of this work",
    "we wish to revise the chemistry network , to extend the analysis to other molecular species ( e.g. , h@xmath5o , nh@xmath150 , sio , sis ) , and to explore the non - equilibrium chemistry of agb cses at different metallicities .",
    "we aim at implementing dust growth in the shocked chemistry of cses , using the schemes already tested in recent studies @xcite .",
    "we also plan to improve the prescriptions for the dynamics of the inner winds of tp - agb stars , taking advantage of the results from state - of - the - art atmosphere models in which shocks , dust condensation , and frequency - dependent radiative transfer are simultaneously included @xcite .",
