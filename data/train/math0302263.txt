    "in a lecture , given in 1966 , h. steinhaus asked the question : do there exist smooth closed space curves without a pair of parallel tangents ?",
    "call such a curve a _",
    "skew loop_. steinhaus conjectured that skew loops did not exist .",
    "the problem was solved by b. segre in @xcite .",
    "segre constructed examples of skew loops in 3-space but proved that no skew loops lie on an ellipsoid or an elliptic paraboloid .",
    "thus skew loops have an aversion to quadrics .",
    "these results were recently extended and refined by m. ghomi and b. solomon @xcite .",
    "on the one hand , the following theorem holds : _ nonnegatively curved quadrics admit no skew loops . _",
    "in particular , no skew loops lie on one sheet of a 2-sheeted hyperboloid . on the other hand ,",
    "the converse is true : _ any non - quadratic surface with a point of positive curvature admits a skew loop .",
    "_    another recent result on this subject @xcite : _ every knot type can be realized by a skew loop_.    a multi - dimensional version of the problem reads as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be an immersion of a manifold to an affine space .",
    "one asks whether there are pairs of points @xmath1 such that the tangent spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parallel in @xmath4 .",
    "such pairs correspond to self - intersections of the image of the tangent gauss map @xmath5 in the grassman manifold @xmath6 of @xmath7-dimensional non - oriented subspaces in @xmath4 .",
    "since dim @xmath8 , these self - intersections generically occur in isolated points .",
    "an immersed closed connected codimension 2 manifold is called a _ skew brane _ if it is free from pairs of parallel tangents .",
    "j. white @xcite considered the case of @xmath9 immersed into the unit sphere @xmath10 in euclidean space @xmath11 .",
    "the main observation in this case is as follows : if @xmath12 is a double normal of @xmath13 , that is , the segment @xmath12 is perpendicular to @xmath13 at both end points , and the points @xmath14 and @xmath15 are not antipodal then the tangent spaces @xmath16 and @xmath17 are parallel in @xmath4 .",
    "this made it possible to estimate below the number of parallel tangents of @xmath13 by morse theory of the distance squared function on @xmath18 , studied in a related paper @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for recent results on double normals of immersed submanifolds in euclidean space .    the goal of this note is to extend the above mentioned results on non - existence of skew loops and skew branes from convex quadratic surfaces to quadratic hypersurfaces of all signatures .",
    "here is our main result .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath19 be a non - degenerate quadratic hypersurface in a vector space @xmath11 and @xmath20 be a generic smooth immersion of a closed manifold .",

    "in particular , there are no generic skew loops on one - sheeted hyperboloids and hyperbolic paraboloids , a new result compared to @xcite .",
    "the meaning of the general position assumption is explained in section 2 .",
    "we give applications to two types of quadratic surfaces in 3-space : to one sheet of the 2-sheeted hyperboloid @xmath22 and to 1-sheeted hyperboloid @xmath23 .",
    "[ hyper ] ( i ) let @xmath24 be a generic smooth closed immersed curve on one sheet of the 2-sheeted hyperboloid , and let @xmath25 be the number of its double points",

    "let @xmath24 be a generic smooth closed immersed curve on the 1-sheeted hyperboloid , and assume that @xmath24 is space - like : the quadratic form @xmath27 , evaluated on its tangent vector , is everywhere positive .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number of double points of @xmath24 and @xmath28 the number of intersections with its antipodal image .",
    "then @xmath24 has at least @xmath29 pairs of tangent lines , parallel in the ambient space . if @xmath30 then there are at least 2 pairs of parallel tangents .    statement ( i ) of theorem [ hyper ] holds for spherical curves that do not intersect their antipodal images ",

    "[ devel ] there exists a pair of points on @xmath24 with tangent lines , parallel in the ambient space .",
    "since cylinders are ruled developable surfaces , this theorem is in sharp contrast with a result from @xcite : _ the cylinder over any non centrally symmetric , strictly convex plane oval contains a skew loop_. this skew loop goes around the cylinder and is not contained in a simply connected domain .",
    "moreover , it was pointed out by d. burago that theorem [ devel ] fails if the the developable surface contains flat pieces ; in this case it may not be ruled .    * acknowledgments*. it is a pleasure to acknowledge the interest and help of d. burago , s. duzhin , m. ghomi , j. landsberg , a. malyutin , r. matveyev , p. pushkar and especially b. solomon who introduced me to the subject .",
