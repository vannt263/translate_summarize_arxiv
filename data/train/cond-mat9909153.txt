    "colloidal suspensions of charged particles represent a special class of ionic fluids @xcite . unlike solutions of simple electrolytes such as nacl , charged colloidal suspensions are highly asymmetric mixtures , containing both macroions and microions with large size and charge differences .",
    "moreover , macroions often exhibit `` polydispersity '' , which means that particles of a same chemical species are not necessarily identical , because their size , charge or other properties may be spread over a large spectrum of values ( chemical species whose particles are all identical are then referred as `` monodisperse '' ) .",
    "the presence of only one polydisperse macroion species is sufficient to make the colloidal suspension a mixture with a very large number @xmath1 of components .",
    "the peculiar features of this `` colloidal regime '' , namely asymmetry and polydispersity , give rise to a variety of phenomena concerning microscopic ordering , phase behaviour , diffusion , and so on .",
    "experimental information on the structure of such fluids can be obtained from small angle scattering ( sas ) techniques , by using light , neutrons or x - rays . however , when a significant degree of polydispersity is present in the sample , the interpretation of experimental data for scattering intensity is hardly a simple task .",
    "in fact , polydispersity and large size - charge differences represent a serious challenge to the available theoretical tools .",
    "monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations for polydisperse colloidal fluids involve very large numbers of particles .",
    "moreover , large size asymmetries at high densities may cause ergodicity problems . on the other hand ,",
    "integral equations ( ie ) of the liquid state theory are analytically solvable only under special conditions , whereas their numerical solution for mixtures with large numbers @xmath1 of components , such as the polydisperse ones , would require large systems of non - linear equations . as a consequence , apart from very few peculiar cases @xcite , ie numerical studies on multicomponent fluids",
    "are usually restricted to @xmath2 finally , under the highly demanding conditions of colloidal suspensions non - convergence problems of the algorithms may often arise .",
    "the present paper will focus on the effects of polydispersity in sas from ionic colloidal mixtures , in the framework of ie theories based upon the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equations with approximate closures .",
    "our study refers to the simplest polydisperse case with only two ionic species : monodisperse microions and macroions with both size and charge polydispersity .",
    "we shall refer to this system as _ polydisperse binary _ ( two - species ) ionic mixture .    to overcome the impossibility of investigating polydisperse systems",
    "when ies have to be solved numerically , one has to reduce the number of components and replace the study of a polydisperse fluid with that of a nearly equivalent but much simpler system .",
    "one possibility , not adopted in this paper , is to neglect microions altogether and approximate the fluid as a system of macroions interacting through a repulsive screened coulomb potential , which implicitly takes into account the contribution of the neglected particles @xcite",
    ". a further refinement of this viewpoint @xcite is to build up an equivalent _ effective mixture _ with @xmath3 new components , whose",
    "molar fractions and diameters are determined by replacing a continuous distribution of macroion sizes with an appropriate @xmath4-component histogram .",
    "usually , @xmath5 @xmath6 is already sufficient and therefore the problem is reduced to get a numerical solution of ies for a three - component macroion mixture .",
    "this procedure could be easily extended to include monodisperse microions and its counterpart would involve a four - component mixture ( three for the macroions plus one for the microions ) .",
    "this method can be expected to be quite accurate , but it would demand a sizeable amount of numerical work .    in this paper we present an even simpler approach , which requires the solution of only two - component ies .",
    "we shall show that the problem of a polydisperse binary ionic mixture can be reduced to the study of a _ monodisperse binary _ ionic mixture , with microions and all identical macroions .",
    "the solution for such a reference system is the `` starting '' point for several approximations of increasing accuracy .",
    "our main purpose is to show that , at the end of this hierarchy , accurate approximate scattering functions for a polydisperse binary mixture can be easily calculated with moderate numerical work upon using a corresponding states theory .",
    "our method hinges on a _",
    "conformality _ @xcite argument , which assumes that all pair correlation functions of the polydisperse fluid have essentially the same `` shape '' of their monodisperse binary counterparts and can be generated from them by means of simple scaling transformations .",
    "this correspondence law is the extension to ionic mixtures of a _ scaling approximation _",
    "( sa ) successfully proposed for nonionic colloids in a recent paper @xcite .",
    "this is a non - trivial extension , since the good performance of the sa for the _ short - range _ potentials of nonionic colloidal fluids examined in ref .",
    "@xcite ( uncharged hard sphere and lennard - jones interactions ) does not automatically ensures the same success in the presence of _ long - range _ coulomb attractions and repulsions .    to properly treat both macroions and microions on the same footing",
    ", the colloidal suspension will be described by the _ primitive model _ ( pm ) of electrolyte solutions , which depicts all ions as charged hard spheres embedded in a dielectric continuum representing the solvent .",
    "the new sa will be tested , for the pm , against results from an analytic treatment of polydispersity , which is exact within the _ mean spherical approximation _ ( msa ) closure for the oz integral equations . in the pm - msa case ,",
    "the oz equations were solved analytically many years ago @xcite , and , more recently , a closed analytical formula was obtained for the scattering intensity from charged hard sphere fluids with any arbitrary number of components @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of the sa is that , because of its simplicity , this scheme can be applied equally well to combinations of potential models and closures for which only a numerical solution of ies is possible .",
    "it is therefore possible for instance , as we shall explicitly show , to couple the sa with the _ hypernetted chain _ ( hnc ) closure , which is more accurate than the msa one for ionic fluids . in these cases",
    "the sa becomes a valuable new tool to predict properties of polydisperse colloidal suspensions in a very simple way .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the basic formalism of the small angle scattering and integral equation theory",
    "is briefly recalled along with the primitive model for polydisperse ionic fluid in section iii . in section",
    "iv our corresponding states treatment of scattering functions is presented in detail , together with two simpler approximations . the exact msa analytical expression for the scattering intensity from charged hard spheres",
    "is also reviewed and some of its predictions for polydisperse fluids will be reported . in section v numerical results from the proposed approximations are compared in detail within the msa .",
    "the performance of the sa with the hnc closure will then be addressed and few remarks will be included in the conclusive section vi .",
    "an ionic colloidal solution is formed by macroions and microions suspended in a homogeneous solvent . usually , this suspending fluid is formed by very small particles ( with respect to the macroions ) and is then modelled as a continuum , characterized by a given dielectric constant and an uniform density of scattering matter .    according to the scattering theory , the intensity of the scattered radiation ( light , neutrons or x - rays ) is proportional to the ensemble or time average , of @xmath7 over all possible equilibrium configurations of the sample particles . here",

    "solvent , @xmath12 has an uniform value @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the continuum solvent hypothesis , we assume that inside each ion ( macroion or microion , indifferently ) the scattering matter has a well - defined boundary , i.e. , there is a _ scattering core _ with a well - defined _ scattering volume , _ not necessarily coincident with the particle volume .",
    "while the former depends on the particle - radiation interaction , the latter is determined by the interparticle repulsions and is well - defined only in the presence of _ hard _ body repulsions .",
    "the definition of a volume for particles with soft repulsions ( e.g. lennard - jones particles ) requires in fact some arbitrary and non - universal convention .    in the case of suspended particles with spherically symmetric interactions ( homogeneous and isotropic fluid ) and spherical homogeneous scattering cores ,",

    "we are interested in studying polydispersity effects by properly considering both macroions and microions on an equal footing .",

    "it is often convenient to adopt a `` continuous representation '' of polydispersity , with @xmath84 and a continuous spectrum of values for the macroion `` disperse '' properties ( size , charge , etc . ) .",
    "in such a _ continuous - mixture _ formalism , we assume that macroions have a continuous distribution of diameters @xmath85 around an average one , denoted by @xmath86 for simplicity , we make the further reasonable assumption that the charge polydispersity of macroions is fully correlated to the size polydispersity .",
    "this can be easily accomplished @xcite by choosing the charge ( or valency ) of each macroion to be proportional to its surface area , i.e. ,    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the valency of the macroions having diameter @xmath86 both size and charge distributions of the macroions are therefore governed by a single independent variable , namely the macroion diameter .",

    "the msa closure yields analytic expressions for both @xmath215 and @xmath214 depending on a single screening parameter @xmath216 which in turn has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "a well known drawback of the msa is that , for dilute solutions of highly charged particles , it may predict unphysical negative values for @xmath217 near the contact distance @xmath218 or in a neighborhood of the first minimum .",
    "some proposal have been advanced to heal this restriction @xcite . for simplicity however , the emphasis of the present work will be mainly on concentrated suspensions of weakly charged particles . in this regime",
    "the msa is reasonably accurate , with the coulomb part of the potential being only a perturbation with respect to the hard sphere one .",
    "the above remark is nevertheless by no means a limit to our method which could be easily associated to more accurate closures such as the `` hypernetted chain approximation '' ( hnc ) , corresponding to take @xmath219 in eq .",
    "( [ as2 ] ) , or the self - consistent mixing scheme ( hmsa ) proposed by zerah and hansen for potentials with attractive terms @xcite .",
    "clearly , in the hnc or hmsa integral equations the monodisperse binary reference fluid can be treated only numerically .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section v - c where an example of such calculation will be provided for the hnc .",
    "in order to display the behavior of the scattering functions under some typical polydisperse conditions , we numerically reproduced a realistic experimental environment .",
    "the microions were given a valency @xmath220 @xmath221 and a diameter @xmath222 @xmath223   ( solvated counterions ) , while we used an average macroion size @xmath224   with relatively small charges @xmath88 in the range @xmath225 ( in @xmath74 units ) to ensure meaningful msa results as previously discussed .",
    "we will increase this value up to @xmath226 later on using hnc .",
    "the scattering due to the microions is in principle not completely negligible and it might be also characterized by a different contrast with respect to the macroions .",
    "nevertheless both contrasts were here fixed to the same value @xmath227 @xmath228 , which is typically found in neutron scattering from silica particles suspended in water @xcite . in evaluating the form factors we further assumed @xmath229 for all particles . a room temperature @xmath230 k and the dielectric constant @xmath231 of water result into a value @xmath232   for the bjerrum length .",
    "all numerical calculations were performed for packing fractions @xmath233 @xmath234 and polydispersity @xmath235 @xmath236 @xmath237 and @xmath234 ( the first value corresponding to the monodisperse binary mixture ) .",
    "we note that when @xmath238 , it is necessary to take @xmath239 for @xmath240 @xmath241 and @xmath242 for @xmath240 @xmath236 to avoid unphysical negative values of the msa @xmath243 at contact .",
    "the three schulz distributions , with polydispersity @xmath244 @xmath237 and @xmath234 , were discretized with a grid size @xmath245 , and truncated at @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 respectively .",
    "these @xmath249 values correspond to polydisperse mixtures with a number of macroion components equal to @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 , practically intractable with the available algorithms for solving ies numerically .      before analyzing the performance of the sa and other approximations",
    ", it is useful to recall how size and charges polydispersity affect the measurable scattering structure factor .",
    "this is achieved by using the closed analytical expression for @xmath214 which is given in appendix which is exact within the msa .",
    "1 depicts the effects of polydispersity on the measurable structure factor .",
    "@xmath253 is plotted as a function of the dimensionless variable @xmath254 for increasing values of @xmath110 and fixed @xmath255 and @xmath256 we note that as @xmath110 increases at fixed @xmath257 , @xmath258 decreases . as expected , the effect of increasing polydispersity is three - fold : i ) the oscillations on the tail of the curves are greatly reduced as a consequence of the destructive interference stemming from the several length scales involved ; ii ) the first peak is lowered , broadened and shifted to smaller @xmath157 values corresponding to a larger typical distance between macroions - macroions nearest - pairs ; iii ) the @xmath259 limit is increased since highly dispersed particles can be more efficiently packed .",
    "all these effects parallel those observed in polydisperse nonionic fluids @xcite as well as in mixtures constituted of only macroions interacting through a repulsive screened coulomb interactions @xcite , and they were already recorded even in the pm @xcite .",
    "next we check the effect of the charge .",
    "this is reported in fig .",
    "2 , where the @xmath253 corresponding to @xmath255 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 is compared with that of the polydisperse mixture of neutral hard spheres which results from `` switching off '' all charges and leaving all other parameters unchanged@xmath112 as the charge increases , the main peak becomes higher and shifts to smaller @xmath157 values , since its position is essentially determined by the macroion - macroion equilibrium distance which becomes larger in the presence of electrostatic repulsions .",
    "the difference in the @xmath259 behavior is also evident : the charges lower the @xmath214 values near the origin , as a consequence of the long - range nature of the coulomb potential .",
    "our aim is now to display the performance of the sa when the partial structure factors @xmath262 of the reference m2 mixture are evaluated using the msa closure .",
    "these sa - msa results are compared with the exact msa solution for polydisperse charged hard spheres previously discussed .",
    "we shall comment in the next subsection on a method we envisaged to avoid unnecessary repetitions in the ie calculations for the m2 mixture .    in fig .",
    "3 the structure factor @xmath263 is shown for two different degrees of polydispersity ( @xmath264 and @xmath234 ) at low concentration and under weak charge conditions ( @xmath265 and @xmath266 ) . the corresponding results from the m2-msa and eda - msa approximations are also reported for comparison . as expected , at small polydispersity ( fig .",
    "3a ) there are very little differences among all these curves , although the eda yields a somewhat larger value for @xmath267 this overestimation of the low-@xmath157 scattering in the eda becomes much larger as polydispersity increases ( fig .",
    "this is the same qualitative trend resulted in the da for neutral systems @xcite . at @xmath261",
    "it is apparent that the position of the first peak in the eda follows that of the m2 , whose maximum is shifted to larger @xmath157 values with respect to the msa result . on the other hand",
    ", the sa reproduces more accurately the position of the first peak and follows very closely the correct curve for @xmath268    the discrepancy in the low-@xmath157 region , which is in fact the most interesting from the sas point of view , can be more clearly seen in fig .",
    "4 , where the scattering intensity per unit volume @xmath26 , calculated for the same parameters of fig . 3",
    "is displayed on a log - log scale .",
    "nevertheless the sa performs overall rather well in all regions .    in fig .",
    "5 the same functions of fig .",
    "3 are then plotted for a more concentrated suspension and higher macroion charges ( @xmath255 and @xmath269 ) , again for @xmath264 and @xmath234 , while the corresponding results for @xmath26 are displayed in fig .",
    "5a and 5b yield compelling evidence of the potentiality of the sa confirming the previous remarks .",
    "it is useful to analyse these results in the sequence @xmath270 in fig .",
    "5a @xmath271 exactly coincides with @xmath272 in the first peak region , but differs from it at the locations of the m2 minima and at small @xmath157 values . on the contrary ,",
    "the sa curve is close to the exact msa one everywhere . in fig .",
    "5b the m2 approximation largely disagrees with the msa one .",
    "the eda improves here on the m2 since it takes all form factors of the polydisperse fluid correctly into account .",
    "it exhibits a lower peak height and practically no subsequent oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , the eda has a dramatic low-@xmath157 overestimate and it behaves poorly in essentially all regions . on the contrary",
    ", the sa is fairly accurate in the whole experimentally accessible @xmath157-range .",
    "its performance at @xmath255 appears to be even more accurate then at @xmath273 all these features are quite remarkable if we recall that the sa , eda and m2 curves have been obtained starting from the same partial structure factors @xmath274 this fact clearly shows the crucial role played by the scaling of the distances .",
    "its effect is to shift the first peak position to the right location and to dump all oscillations after the first peak .",
    "physically it confirm the soundness of our `` conformality '' hypothesis as expressed by eq .",
    "( [ sa6 ] ) and it shows that overlooking differences among macroion - macroion rdfs at contact ( as it is done in the sa ) is a reasonable assumption .      to illustrate the possibility of applying the sa scheme",
    "even when the oz equations admit only numerical solutions , we investigated sa with the hnc closure and analyzed two cases : @xmath265 , @xmath261 with @xmath275 and @xmath276 , respectively ( all other parameters were fixed as before ) . while the first case was already studied with the sa - msa , the second one represents a situation , of low concentration and high charges , in which the msa yields negative values of the macroion - macroion rdf at contact and hence can not be utilized .",
    "this drawback is avoided by using the hnc closure .    in both cases we solved the hnc equations for the parameter values of the corresponding m2 reference mixture , using an @xmath147-space grid size @xmath277 and a number of grid points",
    "@xmath278 this choice implies that @xmath279 with a small enough grid size in @xmath157-space , @xmath280 , allowing the implementation of a `` trick '' proposed in ref .",
    "in fact , the expression for @xmath281 , eq .",
    "( [ sas10 ] ) , would require , at each @xmath282 the evaluation of one term @xmath283 , @xmath83 terms @xmath284 and @xmath285 terms @xmath286 ( recall that @xmath83 is the number of macroion components ) .",
    "these cumbersome repeated calculations can be avoided .",
    "we calculated @xmath287,@xmath288 and @xmath289 at the grid points @xmath290 ( @xmath291 ) _ only once _ , storing all these values in arrays .",
    "although the grid points @xmath292 do not exhaust the whole set of @xmath293 and @xmath294 values required in eq .",
    "( [ sas10 ] ) , the stored structure factors represent a fine sampling of these continuos functions .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath295 is small enough , the value of @xmath296 ( or @xmath297 at a certain point can be approximated with that at the nearest grid point with a negligible error . in this way the sums of eq .",
    "( [ sas10 ] ) can be quickly performed .",
    "figure 7 shows the @xmath298 curves , along with the sa - msa one for @xmath299 as expected , in the lower charge case the sa - hnc prediction is very close to the sa - msa one , with only a slight shift in the first peak position .",
    "the sa - hnc structure factor with @xmath226 is a not trivial result : it refers to a polydisperse colloidal system with mean size ratio @xmath3001:20 and mean ( absolute ) charge ratio @xmath3011:50 .",
    "unfortunately , in this case we can not make a comparison with `` exact '' data . on the other hand ,",
    "the lack of these data and the difficulty of generating them in a very asymmetric regime is just the strongest motivation for introducing approximate theories such as the sa .",
    "in this paper the problem of computing scattering functions for polydisperse ionic colloidal fluids has been addressed by integral equation methods . in the framework of the primitive model we have shown that , despite the complexity of these systems , surprisingly accurate predictions can be obtained with a limited numerical effort . we have successfully extended the _ scaling approximation _ introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite for polydisperse fluids of neutral particles .",
    "the sa still works well when coulombic ( both repulsive and attractive ) interactions are present , notwithstanding the strong charge - size asymmetries of the polydisperse colloidal regime .",
    "only the study of an appropriate monodisperse binary mixture ( the m2 reference system ) is required for a complete characterization of the polydisperse system .",
    "our corresponding states - like theory is based on the simple physical idea of conformality of all rdfs in the polydisperse mixture .",
    "all partial structure factors are generated by scaling their three counterparts of the m2 fluid . in the liquid state theory",
    "similar ideas have been widely exploited in the past @xcite but , to our knowledge , ref .",
    "@xcite and this paper are the first application to polydisperse fluids .    clearly , the sa theory is accurate only in the average .",
    "in fact , the scaling is hardly accurate for each individual pair correlation @xmath302 . in particular",
    ", it incorrectly assumes the equality of the rdfs at contact for all macroion - macroion pairs as well as for the microion - macroion ones . however , an essential feature of our sa is that it correctly ensures @xmath303 inside the hard cores .",
    "these excluded volume conditions are crucial , as it is shown by the failure of the `` extended decoupling approximation '' which neglects them",
    ". the structure factors @xmath281 turn out to be accurate in the first peak region and beyond ; some inaccuracy , due to the harsh approximations of our theory , is found at low @xmath157 values .",
    "since the @xmath259 limit is related to thermodynamics , this means that the sa can be meaningfully exploited to extract structural but not thermodynamical predictions .",
    "because of its simplicity , the sa can be safely employed also when the oz integral equations have to be solved numerically since its application to both different closures and different potential for ionic colloids is feasible .",
    "these features are indicative that sa is a useful theoretical tool to investigate , to first approximation , the structure of polydisperse ( nonionic and ionic ) colloids under highly demanding conditions .",
    "the existence of a good approximation which reduces the study of polydisperse fluids to that of an effective monodisperse one should not be underestimated .",
    "real life colloids are always polydisperse to a certain degree and polydispersity always represents a challenge in the interpretation of experimental data .",
    "we hope that the sa will result particularly useful in the analysis of small angle scattering data , since it considerably outperforms the `` decoupling approximation '' , popular in this context , at the cost of a minimal additional effort",
    ".    it would be interesting to compare our theory with the approach proposed by daguanno and klein @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , these authors followed a different point of view and replaced the continuous schulz distribution with an histogram containing a finite number of well - chosen diameters , thus reducing the polydisperse fluid to an effective mixture with a very small number @xmath4 of components . in this case",
    "however we expect a non - trivial increase in the numerical effort involved .",
    "in fact , to avoid the rapid increase in computational cost with increasing @xmath4 in the daguanno - klein mixtures , that approach was recently modified by lado and coworkers by adding an orthogonal polynomial expansion technique @xcite , and afterwards by merging this with a thermodynamic perturbation scheme @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the sa with these alternative theories is left to future work .    financial support from the italian murst ( ministero delluniversit e della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica ) through the infm ( istituto nazionale di fisica della materia ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "one of us ( dg ) thanks giorgio pastore ( trieste ) and enrique lomba ( madrid ) for providing their hnc computer codes .",
    "in this appendix we report the basic formulas involved in the msa calculation of the scattering intensity from charged hard sphere fluids , as described in @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the following short - hand notations :                      in the limit of point ions ( all @xmath313 ) , @xmath314 becomes the debye inverse shielding length @xmath315 of the debye - hckel theory for electrolyte solutions , while for finite size ions it is always a lower bound ( i.e. @xmath316 ) .",
