    "next to elliptical galaxies , globular clusters are the most thoroughly modeled and best understood class of `` hot '' stellar system",
    ". the simple models of single - mass , isotropic , lowered isothermal spheres developed by @xcite have been fit to a large majority of the @xmath3 galactic globulars currently known , yielding comprehensive catalogues of cluster structural parameters and derived physical properties @xcite .",
    "these have been used to explore a multitude of scaling relations and interdependences between the various properties @xcite , leading to the definition of a fundamental plane for globular clusters which is analogous to but physically distinct from that for early - type galaxies and bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic and hst imaging data have also been collected , and fit with @xcite models , for a large number of globulars in m31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , m33 @xcite , and ngc 5128 = centaurus a @xcite .",
    "these clusters appear to follow essentially the same scaling relations and lie on the same fundamental plane as galactic globulars .    that these data contain",
    "important information on the formation and evolution of globular clusters ( gcs ) is clear .",
    "but cleanly separating formative from evolutionary influences on the present - day form of gc structural correlations and the fundamental plane is difficult in the absence of any rigorous , first - principles predictions for the systemic properties of newly born star clusters .",
    "this issue only gains in importance with the emergent consensus that the `` super '' star clusters now forming in nearby starbursts and galaxy mergers , and even massive young clusters in more quiescent disks , may well be close analogues to what globular clusters were a hubble time ago .",
    "what , then , can the properties of gcs tell us about how star clusters form in general ?",
    "conversely , what can a comparison between the properties of young clusters and gcs add to our understanding of the globulars ?    important steps towards addressing these questions have been made by studies of the mass - radius relations for young massive clusters in merging galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and relatively nearby spiral disks @xcite , and , on a somewhat different scale , for the ( young ) nuclear clusters in very late - type spirals @xcite",
    ". however , the data on these clusters  all of which are at distances of many mpc  are necessarily much less complete , and in some respects more uncertain , than those for globular clusters in the milky way and even out to ngc 5128 .",
    "a comprehensive study of young cluster properties vs.  gc properties requires a catalogue for the former which includes the full suite of physical parameters routinely calculated for galactic gcs , preferably obtained within the same modeling framework and to comparable precision and accuracy .",
    "our main goal in this paper is to contribute to such a database , focusing specifically on the nearby populations of massive clusters in the large and small magellanic clouds . in particular",
    ", we fit a variety of models to obtain derived parameters for 53 lmc clusters and 10 smc clusters with high - quality , hst - based surface - density profiles of their inner parts measured by @xcite .",
    "thirteen of these objects are globular clusters older than 10 gyr ; the other 50 range in age from several myr to a few gyr . at the same time , @xcite have published new surface - brightness profiles for the 5 old gcs in the fornax dwarf spheroidal , so we include these in our catalogue as well . as we describe below",
    ", some aspects of our analyses of these lmc , smc , and fornax clusters go beyond what is normally done for gcs .",
    "thus , we also take surface - brightness profiles for globulars in the milky way from the collection of @xcite , and some supplementary data from the catalogue of @xcite , in order to model as many galactic gcs as is practical in precisely the same way that we treat the mackey & gilmore datasets . the exact number of galactic gcs that we include depends on the context of our various calculations .",
    "much in the existing catalogues of galactic gc properties is based on the same surface - brightness data from @xcite that we employ here ; and , as we said above , the catalogues already contain the results of reasonably uniform modeling of the clusters .",
    "however , all of this is within the context of the theoretical @xcite isotropic , modified isothermal spheres .",
    "@xcite , for their part , tabulate estimates of cluster central surface brightnesses , core radii , total luminosities , and total masses derived from fits of power - law models for their surface - density profiles : @xmath4^{-(\\gamma-1)/2}$ ] .",
    "( mackey & gilmore s cluster masses further depend on their application of population - synthesis models . )",
    "one of our aims here is to homogenize the analysis of the basic data on young and globular clusters alike , and thus we completely re - fit all of the lmc , smc , fornax , and milky way cluster profiles with _ both _ @xcite",
    "_ and _ power - law models .",
    "it is then important to recognize mackey & gilmore s motivation for fitting asymptotic power laws to their cluster sample in the first place .    in their pioneering study of the structure of young clusters in the lmc",
    ", @xcite found that @xcite models are not always capable of describing the outer - envelope structures of these objects , which are very extended spatially and may be better fit by power laws that do not include the sharp tidal cut - offs built into king models .",
    "some subsequent studies of other young massive clusters have come to the same conclusion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been argued that this reflects the presence of rather massive halos of unbound stars around the clusters , which ( it is presumed ) will eventually be stripped away by tides to leave behind a more familiar , king - like body .",
    "however , so far as we are aware , there have not been any systematic attempts made to fit large samples of young clusters with structural models that are more extended than @xcite but still spatially truncated rather than formally infinite like power laws . nor , for that matter , has any such test been performed on old gcs .",
    "thus , in this paper we also fit our combined lmc / smc / fornax / milky way cluster sample with a third type of model which is intermediate to king and power - law models . for this",
    "we have chosen a spherical and isotropic version of the model originally developed by @xcite for application to elliptical galaxies .",
    "wilson s model is essentially a single - mass , modified isothermal sphere like a @xcite model in its core but with an ad hoc change in the `` lowering '' term in the stellar distribution function to give more extended ( though still finite ) halos for otherwise similar clusters .    in  [ sec : data ] below , we discuss in detail the surface - brightness data that we use to fit models to the clusters in our sample . in the lmc and smc ,",
    "we supplement many of the hst - derived profiles in @xcite with older ( ground - based ) starcount densities for the same clusters . in many cases",
    "this allows the density profiles to be defined out to substantially larger projected radii . for the fornax clusters , we rely exclusively on the @xcite data .",
    "we work in the @xmath2 band , and in all cases we check mackey & gilmore s magnitude scales against ground - based aperture magnitudes from the literature .",
    "we find it necessary to recalibrate mackey & gilmore s surface brightnesses , since as published they lead to integrated magnitudes that are always too faint  often by several tenths of a mag  relative to the ground - based numbers .",
    "the zeropoint correction for every cluster is tabulated .",
    "our discussion of the milky way gc surface - brightness data is very brief , as we simply take them ( also in the @xmath2 band ) from @xcite with minor modifications .    following that",
    ", in  [ sec : popsyn ] we explore the use of population - synthesis models to infer an extinction @xmath5 and mass - to - light ratio @xmath6 for each of the 68 lmc , smc , and fornax clusters from @xcite  who have also provided an age and metallicity for every cluster , either compiled from cmd studies in the literature or estimated themselves  and for 148 galactic gcs with metallicities listed in the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "we resort to the use of extinctions based on population - synthesis model colors to derive intrinsic luminosities , etc .",
    ", from the observations of lmc and smc clusters , because direct measurements of reddening are not available for the majority of that sample .",
    "( measured extinctions are available for the fornax and milky way gcs , and we use those as a check on our population - synthesis model values . ) we need theoretical mass - to - light ratios for most of the clusters in all four galaxies in order to convert from luminosity to mass when determining a number of dynamical cluster parameters ( velocity dispersions have been observed for only a fraction of the clusters under consideration here ) .",
    "we tabulate @xmath5 and @xmath6 for every cluster as determined using each of two publicly available population - synthesis codes @xcite under a number of different assumptions on the form of the stellar imf . for our subsequent modeling ,",
    "however , we only use the values predicted by the code of @xcite with the disk - star imf of @xcite .",
    "@xcite also used population - synthesis modeling to estimate mass - to - light ratios for their lmc / smc / fornax clusters ; but they assumed a much steeper imf than we do and obtained systematically different numbers for @xmath6 .",
    "section [ sec : modeling ] first describes (  [ subsec : mods ] ) some salient aspects of king , power - law , and wilson models .",
    "then  [ subsec : fits ] shows in detail how each compares to the observed surface - brightness and internal velocity - dispersion profiles of the well studied gc @xmath7 centauri ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , before presenting the bulk of our results , the basic parameters of each model fit to each of the 68 lmc , smc , and fornax clusters and 85 galactic globulars .",
    "these are accompanied by a number of derived cluster properties , all evaluated within each of the three fitted models : central and half - light averaged surface brightnesses and mass densities ; core and effective radii ; concentrations and tidal radii ( or infinite power - law slope ) ; predicted central velocity dispersions and escape velocities ; total luminosities , masses , and binding energies ; central phase - space densities ; and half - mass relaxation times . in ",
    "[ subsec : fitcomp ] we compare our fits to those in existing catalogues ( when the latter overlap with our work ) , and we check that our derived cluster properties are generally well defined regardless of which model is fit to the data .",
    "we also investigate in  [ subsec : fitcomp ] the question of which model tends to fit these clusters best .",
    "we find that , for @xmath8 of our full sample of young massive clusters _ and _ old globular clusters , the more extended @xcite models provide equally good or significantly better fits than @xcite models .",
    "untruncated power laws generally describe the young clusters about as well as the spatially limited wilson models ; only occasionally are they slightly better .",
    "thus , we conclude that ( 1 ) unlimited power laws are not the only description possible for the halos of young lmc / smc clusters in particular , and ( 2 ) structure extending beyond what is predicted by @xcite models is a fairly generic feature of any star cluster , rather than something present only at young ages .",
    "_ it is not obvious that all such extended halos must necessarily be unbound _ , but it is a subtle problem to measure accurately the tidal radius of a cluster and to compare it properly to the theoretical roche lobe defined by a galaxy s tidal field . we do not tackle the issue in any detail in this paper .    in  [ sec :",
    "dynml ] we collect velocity - dispersion data from the literature for a subset of 19 magellanic cloud and fornax clusters and 38 galactic gcs , and use these in conjunction with our surface - brightness fits to derive dynamical mass - to - light ratios for them .",
    "we compare these directly to the population - synthesis model values which we used to derive all mass - dependent cluster properties .",
    "the agreement is very good on average .    finally , ",
    "[ sec : kappa ] presents the `` @xmath0-space '' parameters of @xcite and @xcite ( or , more precisely , mass - equivalent versions of these ) for the 153 young and globular clusters to which we fit all three of our structural models .",
    "we also tabulate in this section the galactocentric radii of all the objects .",
    "these quantities complete what is needed to construct the fundamental plane of star clusters in any of the equivalent formulations that can be found in the current literature .",
    "however , we leave the actual delineation and interpretation of all cluster correlations , including discussion of young vs.  old populations , for future work .",
    "in this section we collect and combine , in a uniform fashion , available data defining the run of surface brightness as a function of radius in a significant number of nearby and well - resolved globular and young , massive star clusters .    in the case of the milky way globular cluster ( gc ) system , this task has in fact already been completed by @xcite , who gathered inhomogeneous surface - brightness ( sb ) and starcount data from the literature for 124 gcs and combined them objectively into a single , zeropointed @xmath2-band sb profile for each cluster .",
    "this database has served as the raw material for the standard catalogues ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* updated 2003 february ) of @xcite model parameters for galactic gcs .",
    "here we similarly work from the @xcite gc profile data for our modeling of milky way globulars .",
    "although some of these profiles have been superseded by more recent work on a few individual clusters , we have not attempted to incorporate any such updates into the trager et al .",
    "catalogue , preferring instead to draw on data that have been processed in a homogeneous way by a single set of authors .",
    "a few further details on our handling of the trager et al .",
    "data are given in ",
    "[ subsec : trager ] below .",
    "the situation for well - resolved massive clusters in the magellanic clouds and the fornax dwarf spheroidal is not quite as simple , although in these cases the recent studies of @xcite have gone a long way towards providing a close analogue to the @xcite dataset for milky way globulars .",
    "mackey & gilmore performed starcounts on the inner @xmath9 of 68 massive clusters ( including 18 old globulars ) from archival hst ( wfpc2 ) images , providing the most accurate definitions of the _ core _ structures of these objects .",
    "( in the lmc , at a distance of @xmath10 kpc , 100  corresponds to 24.2 pc ; in the smc , with @xmath11 kpc , @xmath12 pc ; for the fornax dwarf , @xmath13 kpc and @xmath14 pc . )",
    "mackey & gilmore further converted their starcount densities to @xmath2-band fluxes and published their results as standard surface - brightness profiles .",
    "our modeling of the lmc / smc / fornax clusters is therefore based in largest part on the work of @xcite . again in the interest of confining our attention to as uniform a raw dataset as possible , we have not brought into the sample any other magellanic cloud clusters studied by other authors .",
    "( note however , that mackey & gilmore s clusters do include many previously observed from the ground and modeled by other authors ; see their papers for details of the overlap and comparisons with earlier work . )",
    "we did , however , find it useful to go back through the literature to supplement mackey & gilmore s hst data with ( 1 ) any available ground - based starcount data at projected radii @xmath15 , and ( 2 ) all available concentric - aperture photometry for these 68 clusters .",
    "the detailed comparison of the hst data against ground - based aperture photometry and large - radius starcounts , and our combination of these into a single , properly zeropointed @xmath2-band sb profile for each cluster , are what we describe now .",
    "table [ tab : starcount ] lists all sources of star counts that we have taken from the literature for the 53 massive clusters ( including 12 old globulars ) studied by @xcite in the large magellanic cloud ; the 10 ( including one gc ) studied by @xcite in the smc ; and the 5 globular clusters of the fornax dwarf spheroidal @xcite .",
    "we note again that , although mackey & gilmore have published their data as sb profiles , they are in fact number densities converted to net mag arcsec@xmath16 ; the other papers listed in table [ tab : starcount ] publish their results directly as number densities @xmath17 per unit area on the sky , either already corrected for or accompanied by an estimate of background contamination .",
    "the older data can be combined with those of mackey & gilmore by transforming the ground - based @xmath17 as @xmath18 , with the constant @xmath19 chosen to provide the best average agreement with the hst surface brightnesses at clustercentric radii where the observations overlap .    for each of their 68 clusters in these three galactic satellites , ( * ? ? ?",

    "we have chosen to work on the @xmath2 magnitude scale , but to make maximal use of the new hst data , we have combined the data in the secondary bands with the main @xmath2-band data by applying a constant color term to the former .",
    "these instrumental colors are determined simply from integrating to find the total magnitude of every mg03 cluster in both @xmath2 and @xmath20 or @xmath21 , and then adding the difference @xmath22 or @xmath23 to every point in the secondary sb profile .",

    "this appears to be related to the fact that , in performing their number counts , mg03 necessarily had to mask out some bright stars , whether because of issues with saturation or scattered light , or because they disturbed the smoother overall distribution of the underlying , more numerous fainter stars in the cluster .",
    "the flux from these stars was _ not _ added back in when the stellar counts were converted to mag arcsec@xmath16 , so that the @xmath2-band surface brightnesses published in mg03 are systematically too faint ( see the discussion in * ? ? ?",

    "figure [ fig : zeropts ] is a histogram of the zeropoint corrections required to bring the mg03 surface brightnesses into agreement with the independent aperture photometry we have taken from the literature .",
    "some of these offsets are rather surprisingly large , particularly in a few of the lmc clusters , and the possibility exists in principle that the older aperture magnitudes could be the ones in error  if , say , a bright foreground star were unwittingly included in the ground - based aperture but properly excluded from the hst analysis .",
    "however , a detailed examination of several specific cases has shown that the ground - based numbers are _ not _ the ones at fault ( mackey 2003 , private communication ) .",
    "more general support for the same conclusion comes from the fact that , as we describe just below , there is typically good agreement between the integrated @xmath235 profile _ shapes _ from the mg03 and ground - based data in many clusters where multiple aperture magnitudes can be found in the literature  suggesting that if the ground - based data were erroneously brightened by foreground stars , these would have had to be projected essentially onto the very centers of the clusters in an inordinate number of cases .",
    "and the instrumental colors ( table [ tab : colors ] ) of those clusters for which mg03 publish both @xmath20 and @xmath2 surface - brightness profiles do not agree with the aperture - photometry colors from the literature [ column ( 4 ) of table [ tab : poptable ] below ] , even when the @xmath2-band zeropoint correction that we infer is negligible ( implying that the missing @xmath2 flux in mg03 is not generally consistent with a regular population of foreground stars ) .",

    "note that for two of the lmc clusters ( sl-663 and sl-855 ) we could find no independent @xmath2 photometry against which to compare the mg03 calibration ; while for globular cluster 1 in fornax , various estimates of the total @xmath2 magnitude from @xcite and @xcite differ from each other by at least as much as they do from the implied mg03 magnitude . in these three cases",
    ", we do not apply any zeropoint correction to the mg03 surface brightnesses , but we recognize that the adopted numbers could be in error by tenths of a magnitude in each case .    for 32 of the clusters , ground - based @xmath2 magnitudes are available in the literature for more than one aperture  allowing for further checks in these cases , both of the consistency between the various old magnitude estimates and of the overall _ shape _ of the new mackey & gilmore profiles .",

    "five other core - collapsed globulars remain in the trager et al .  sample .",
    "these are known a priori not to be properly described by king models ( or others with constant - density cores ) and so we remove them as well from consideration for structural modeling , but list them in table [ tab : mwnotfit ] and include them in our population - synthesis modeling .",
    "before proceeding with the structural and dynamical modeling of the clusters in our magellanic cloud , fornax , and milky way sample , we discuss some aspects of population - synthesis modeling .",
    "we have folded this into our derivation of physical cluster parameters from model fits to the cluster sb distributions .",
    "there are two main issues at hand that necessitate these considerations :    first , in order to move from a description of the observed surface brightness profile of a cluster to one of the true luminosity density profile , we need information on the extinction towards the cluster . for each of the milky way globular clusters that we model , an estimate of the foreground reddening @xmath245 is available in the catalogue of @xcite",
    "; the extinction follows directly , and the required corrections are straightforward .",
    "the same is true of the globulars in fornax ; @xcite , for example , have tabulated measurements from the literature of the reddenings @xmath245 of each cluster .",
    "but , as was mentioned above , there is no such information in the literature for many of the 63 lmc and smc clusters being analyzed here .",
    "aperture measurements ( ground - based ) of the clusters @xmath263 colors do exist , however ( see the references in table [ tab : apphot ] ) , as do individual estimates of their ages and metallicities ( compiled from the literature , again , by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore use the cluster ages and [ fe / h ] values to derive an expected intrinsic @xmath244 from population - synthesis models , and then @xmath264 and @xmath246 . the fact",
    "that direct reddening measurements do exist for the milky way and fornax globular clusters allows us to perform the same analysis on them , and then compare our `` theoretical '' @xmath245 values to the known ones  a valuable check on the method , albeit only in the extreme of old ages .",
    "second , to go from a description of the de - reddened luminosity density profile of a cluster to its _ mass _ density distribution , knowledge of an average mass - to - light ratio is required .",
    "given a sample of clusters of a roughly common age ( and a common stellar imf ) , the mass - to - light ratio typically can also be treated as roughly constant , at least to within a factor of order unity which depends on [ fe / h ] differences .",
    "luminosity differences are then essentially proportional to mass differences , and detailed knowledge of the exact mass - to - light ratio is not critical to the accurate discernment of relative trends in physical cluster properties ( such as mass - radius , mass - velocity dispersion , or other fundamental - plane correlations ) . in our case , however , we aim ultimately to compare these sorts of correlations for the old globular clusters in the milky way and other galaxies ( ages @xmath265 gyr for the most part ) , against those for the much younger massive clusters in the magellanic clouds ( @xmath266 yr and as young as @xmath267 yr for r136=30 doradus ) . trends or correlations in luminosity then reflect a complex mix of age and mass effects which must be separated to make sense of the physical situation .",
    "ideally , we would have liked to use measurements of the stellar velocity dispersions in the clusters to compute their mass - to - light ratios directly ; but , as for the reddenings , such measurements exist for only a handful of the young lmc / smc clusters , and they tend to be highly uncertain . even in the milky way",
    "globular cluster system , reliable velocity - dispersion measurements and dynamical @xmath268 ratios exist for fewer than half of the 85 clusters that we model here .",
    "therefore , we also use population - synthesis models to define a @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratio for every cluster in our total sample . in  [ sec : dynml ] we compare these predicted values with the dynamical mass - to - light ratios that can be computed for the minority of ( mostly old ) clusters with measured velocity dispersions .",
    "the population - synthesis model that we have chosen to use to derive cluster reddenings and mass - to - light ratios is that of @xcite , using the padova 1994 stellar - evolution tracks and assuming a stellar imf following that of @xcite for the galactic disk population .",
    "the results are presented in ",
    "[ subsec : results ] .",
    "however , since they are so central to the establishment of all final , physical ( mass - based ) cluster properties and to the definition of systematic interdependences between these properties , we have also carried through the full suite of calculations with the alternate population - synthesis code pgase @xcite and under different assumptions on the form of the stellar imf . in  [ subsec : comp ] , then , we first present point - by - point comparisons between the @xmath245 and @xmath269 values predicted by various combinations of codes and imfs .",
    "note , however , that we _",
    "always _ assume that every cluster is a single - age population formed instantaneously in one coherent burst of star formation , and that all clusters , of any age or metallicity in any galaxy , share a common stellar imf .",
    "also , both @xcite and @xcite have coded prescriptions for mass loss over time due to stellar - evolution debris ( from winds and supernovae , essentially ) that is assumed to be swept out of a cluster .",
    "when using either code , we always employ these prescriptions .",
    "the @xcite disk - star imf that we adopt for our primary calculations is a @xcite power law ( @xmath270 ) for stellar masses @xmath271 , and a much flatter , lognormal distribution below @xmath272 . figures [ fig : popcols ] and [ fig : popmtol ] show , in their larger ( upper ) panels , the intrinsic colors @xmath244 and @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratios @xmath6 predicted by the @xcite code for a single - burst ( or `` simple '' ) stellar population with this imf , as functions of cluster age for three set heavy - element abundances roughly spanning the range appropriate for our combined sample of globular and young massive clusters .",
    "the smaller ( bottom ) panels in these figures show the _ differences _ in @xmath244 and @xmath273 as predicted by the pgase code of @xcite given the same imf and the same metallicities .",
    "aside from the problematic region around ages @xmath274 yr , there is generally good agreement between the two codes .",
    "figure [ fig : popcomp ] expands somewhat on these plots , showing @xmath244 and @xmath6 predicted as functions of cluster [ fe / h ] at various ages , all for a @xcite disk imf .",
    "the logarithm of cluster age is labeled in the upper panel of each pair in this figure .",
    "filled circles are the quantities predicted by @xcite at the six metallicities for which their code has stellar - evolution tracks .",
    "the solid curve joining these points is a spline interpolation , which we use to infer @xmath244 and @xmath6 for clusters with metallicities between the few that are explicitly calculable ( at any age ) with the bruzual - charlot code .",
    "the open squares in every panel are the synthetic colors and mass - to - light ratios predicted by pgase v.2.0 , again at the six metallicities for which that code has explicit stellar - evolution tracks ( these metallicities , and indeed the tracks themselves , are the same as those used by bruzual & charlot ) .",
    "the dashed lines joining the squares are linear interpolations for determining quantities at intermediate [ fe / h ] .",
    "( the pgase code does this interpolation internally , given any arbitrary [ fe / h ] specified by the user . )",
    "more detailed discussion of the comparison between the pgase and bruzual - charlot codes  including the difficulties at young ages @xmath275 years , which fortunately are not relevant to us in general  may be found in @xcite .",
    "the plots we have presented have vertical - axis scales chosen deliberately to emphasize the differences between the codes for one imf . evidently , although there are some exceptions , these differences are generally slight : at the level of @xmath276 mag in @xmath244 and @xmath277 in @xmath6 .",
    "again , we have adopted the bruzual & charlot code to define the intrinsic colors and mass - to - light ratios for our clusters , and we can proceed with some confidence that this choice is not introducing sizeable systematic errors in our subsequent analyses .",
    "the next question concerns the implications of our choice of the @xcite disk - star imf for the population - synthesis calculations .",
    "the bruzual - charlot code offers only the choice between this option or a pure @xcite power law at all stellar masses ( which is well known by now to be an incorrect description of the true imf below @xmath278 , but is still commonly used for reference calculations ) .",
    "by contrast , the pgase code of fioc & rocca - volmerange can produce models for any user - defined imf .",
    "we have therefore used pgase to calculate @xmath244 and @xmath6 as functions of age for clusters of three different metal abundances ( @xmath279 , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 , as in figs .",
    "[ fig : popcols ] and [ fig : popmtol ] ) , given three stellar imfs besides our preferred @xcite disk - star distribution .",
    "the alternate imfs that we have examined are those of @xcite ( a single power law , @xmath282 at all masses ) ; @xcite ( a three - part piecewise power law which , with @xmath283 above @xmath284 , is significantly steeper than either salpeter or chabrier at high masses , but significantly shallower than salpeter  and not substantially different from chabrier s disk imf  at lower masses ) ; and the `` globular cluster '' imf of @xcite ( which is nearly the same as his disk - star imf but for a somewhat narrower and displaced lognormal peak below @xmath285 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : imfcomp ] shows the differences in the predicted @xmath244 and _ logarithmic _ @xmath6 predicted by pgase for these imfs vs.  the @xcite disk - star function .",
    "the bold solid lines in both panels of figure [ fig : imfcomp ] compare the chabrier disk and @xcite imfs ; the bold dashed lines , the chabrier disk and @xcite imfs ; and the bold dotted lines , the chabrier disk and `` globular cluster '' imfs .",
    "all of these bold lines correspond to a cluster metal abundance @xmath286 ; the thinner lines around them refer to @xmath287 and @xmath288 ( for clarity , in the upper panel the lines for different metallicities are only shown for the chabrier disk vs.  kroupa et al .",
    "imf comparison ) . clearly , the choice of imf has little bearing on the intrinsic @xmath244 color of a cluster at a given age , with changes of less than a few hundredths of a magnitude  within the differences between the pgase and bruzual - charlot codes  typically being implied .",
    "given that the color is the ratio of the total cluster luminosity in two bandpasses , and the two codes employ essentially identical treatments of stellar evolution , its robustness against even major changes in the imf is expected .",
    "the @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratio is , however , naturally more sensitive to details of the imf .",
    "the salpeter imf gives @xmath6 consistently higher than the chabrier disk imf ( by factors of @xmath289 ) , because of the much higher proportion of the total cluster mass that the former distribution places in very faint , low - mass stars . as we mentioned just above , however , it is known that the salpeter imf is not a good description of the real distribution at low stellar masses ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the difference in @xmath6 between chabrier s disk and `` globular cluster '' imfs is essentially negligible until very old ages , where the gc imf would predict slightly lower mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this is because the two imfs are identical at stellar masses @xmath290 , where both take on the salpeter power - law shape .",
    "it is only after these relatively massive stars have all evolved significantly that the slight difference between the two imfs at lower stellar masses has a measurable effect .",
    "even then the effect is small , however , and in any case chabrier s disk imf is better constrained empirically than his gc imf  both arguments for our use of the disk - star imf to make predictions for all of our clusters , gcs as well as the massive young objects in the lmc and smc .",
    "by contrast , the difference between @xmath6 as computed for the @xcite disk imf vs.  the @xcite imf is rather dramatic and , more worrisome , varies systematically with cluster age .",
    "this is a direct result of the much steeper slope specified by the kroupa et al .",
    "imf for stellar masses above @xmath285 . for a given total cluster mass , the kroupa et al .",
    "model initially puts a much smaller fraction into massive ( and bright ) stars , yielding significantly higher mass - to - light ratios at young ages . over time , @xmath6 for the kroupa et al .",
    "imf approaches @xmath6 for the chabrier imf , because the two imfs are effectively the same at stellar masses @xmath291which , of course , contribute all the cluster light at ages of 10 gyr and more .    clearly , the choice between these two imfs has a direct impact on the mass - to - light ratios and all dependent physical parameters of clusters younger than @xmath292 yr  which is to say , all of the young lmc and smc clusters that we model . in principle , given the strong systematics in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : imfcomp ] , choosing between these two particular imfs might even influence the ultimate inference of correlations between ( mass - based ) cluster properties .",
    "we much prefer the @xcite disk - star imf , which has stronger and more recent empirical support than the older kroupa et al .  function .",
    "but it is important to note that @xcite adopted the kroupa et al .",
    "imf for their own population - synthesis modeling .",
    "_ our estimates below of the young lmc / smc cluster mass - to - light ratios therefore differ significantly from those presented by mackey & gilmore .",
    "_ however , the lower @xmath6 implied by our choice of imf combines with our generally brighter @xmath2-band surface - brightness scale (  [ subsec : mackey ] ) to produce cluster masses and mass densities that often differ less strongly from those in mg03 .",

    "our model value for 30 dor is 0.407 mag .    in what follows ,",

    "these issues can only be tackled by completely fitting both of the model types just described to all of the clusters in all four galaxies of our sample .",

    "although patently an ad hoc thing to do , the net effect of this more gradual lowering of the isothermal sphere is to produce clusters which are spatially more extended than @xcite models , but still finite .",
    "it will be noted that there is a slight asymmetry between equations ( [ eq : king ] ) and ( [ eq : wilson ] ) and equation ( [ eq : power ] ) : the former explicitly involve a velocity scale parameter @xmath323 , while the latter incorporates an explicit radial scale @xmath315 . in the formulation of his model , @xcite defined a radial scale associated with @xmath323 : @xmath324 where @xmath325 is the central mass density of the model .",

    "the fundamental physical question remaining from @xcite is whether the stars at the largest observed radii in the young clusters particularly are gravitationally bound in a model - independent sense : do these objects overflow the roche lobes defined by the potentials of their parent galaxies ? simply fitting power laws to the clusters does not in fact address this issue , as equally good or better fits of spatially limited wilson models can be found ; but at the same time , it remains to be shown that the fitted @xmath333 from the wilson models actually correspond to the true tidal limits imposed by the galaxies .",
    "moreover , the question now has to be extended to many old globulars . to properly answer it for any cluster",
    "requires _ at a minimum _ not only a highly precise empirical estimate of @xmath333 itself , but also a detailed understanding of the total mass distribution and gravitational field of the parent galaxy ; good information on the present - day galactocentric position of the cluster ; and knowledge of its orbital energy and pericenter .",

    "some of these differences in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] relative to the upper panels may simply be a reflection of the more heterogeneous nature of the original data compiled by @xcite .",
    "it could also be indicative of the ultimate limitations of our assumptions of velocity isotropy and ( probably more important ) a single - mass stellar population in the clusters : ngc 104 , for example , is known to exhibit mass segregation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and can be fit well with multimass king models @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we find here that the cluster ngc 5272 = m 3 , which was the original motivation for the development of multimass king models @xcite , can be perfectly well fit by a single - mass and isotropic wilson model ; it is the filled circle at @xmath452 and @xmath453 in the lower right panel of fig .

    "this issue aside , we now turn to consider whether the observable , physical properties  core and half - light radii , total luminosities , and the like  that we have derived for our clusters are reasonably model - independent .",
    "in particular , we would like some assurance that they are robust enough to allow useful characterizations of parameter interdependences and trends between clusters .      figure [ fig : mgwk ] compares the wilson- and king - model values for a number of parameters of the lmc , smc , and fornax ( mg03 ) clusters in our sample ( see tables [ tab : basic][tab : dyn ] ) .",

    "for definiteness , the results for @xmath493 from our wilson modeling have been used in this plot , but it makes no significant difference if the king- or power - law model numbers are used instead . in all cases , the median @xmath495 .",
    "the few young massive clusters in the lmc and smc for which we have obtained dynamical mass - to - light estimates are shown as open symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : upsrat ] . although these tend to fall nominally above the line @xmath496 , their measured @xmath483 in table [ tab : popvdyn ] are relatively uncertain , as our associated errorbars attest .",
    "in fact , in three of the six cases only _ upper limits _ to @xmath483 are given by the original authors .",
    "all other points in fig .",
    "[ fig : upsrat ] refer to old ( @xmath497 yr ) globular - type clusters and , as mentioned above , provide a direct check only on that extreme of the population - synthesis models .",
    "overall , however , we feel confident that our use of @xmath299 in general to infer mass - based cluster properties from simple surface - brightness modeling is well justified .",
    "we anticipate a main use of our results in tables [ tab : basic ] , [ tab : struc ] , and [ tab : dyn ] above to be in the definition and interpretation of correlations between the primary physical properties of star clusters .",
    "ultimately , such correlations can constrain theories of cluster formation and evolution .",
    "they have been identified and discussed in many forms in the literature for old , globular clusters in the milky way and a few other galaxies .",
    "so far as we are aware , our work here is the first to allow for systematic investigation of the effects of fitting gcs with models other than that of @xcite .",
    "it is also the first to put a significant number of young massive clusters on a completely equal footing with the old globulars .",
    "correlations among gcs are typically couched in terms of a structural `` fundamental plane '' analogous to that originally defined by @xcite and @xcite for dynamically hot galaxies .",
    "there are at least three _ equivalent _ formulations of the globular cluster fundamental plane in the literature :    first , @xcite presents strong bivariate correlations involving @xmath400 , @xmath315 , @xmath344 , @xmath260 , and @xmath498 , showing galactic gcs to be an essentially two - parameter family .",
    "second , @xcite works with @xmath6 , @xmath318 , king - model @xmath335 , and global binding energy @xmath392 to arrive , in different form and with different physical emphasis , at the same basic conclusion .",
    "mclaughlin shows explicitly the equivalence between his and djorgovski s formulations of the gc fundamental plane . in",
    "either , the galactocentric positions @xmath499 of the globulars are an important external influence ; it is well known , for example , that gc half - mass radii and binding energies correlate significantly with their location in the galaxy .    to bring young massive clusters , such as those we have modeled in the lmc and smc , into analyses along these lines , it is preferable to work in terms of @xmath410 , @xmath500 , and @xmath501rather than their luminosity or surface - brightness equivalents  so as to avoid purely age - related effects .",
    "all but one of the required fundamental - plane variables for our full cluster sample are then given in tables [ tab : basic ] through [ tab : dyn ] above .",
    "the last  cluster positions within their parent galaxies  is listed in table [ tab : kappa ] , discussed below .",
    "a third equivalent formulation of the fundamental plane is that of @xcite and @xcite , who manipulate the basic observables of velocity dispersion , surface density , and half - mass radius to define an orthonormal set of derived parameters , @xmath502 and find tight distributions in @xmath503 vs.  @xmath504 for early - type galaxies and ( separately ) for globular clusters . @xcite and @xcite actually define this `` @xmath0 space '' using the luminosity intensity @xmath505 averaged over the half - light radius @xmath260 ; but in order to remove the influence of age from comparisons of cluster structures , we instead use the average mass density @xmath506 .",
    "then @xmath507 is related to the total mass of a system , and @xmath508 contains the exact details of this relationship  that is , information on the internal density profile .",
    "in fact , the mass - based @xmath503 of equation ( [ eq : kspace ] ) can be viewed as a replacement for king- or wilson - model concentrations @xmath335 or power - law indices @xmath317 , or any other model - specific shape parameter . as such , any trends involving @xmath503 are directly of relevance to questions concerning cluster ( non)homology .",
    "the definition of @xmath509 is chosen simply to make the three @xmath0 parameters mutually orthogonal ; it results in the correspondence @xmath510 ( see * ? ? ? * for further discussion ) .",
    "table [ tab : kappa ] gives the values of @xmath504 , @xmath509 , and @xmath503 for all the young and globular clusters that we fit with structural models in  [ subsec : fits ] . in calculating these parameters ,",
    "we have used the @xmath400 and @xmath501 values as predicted in table [ tab : dyn ] by our adoption of population - synthesis mass - to - light ratios .",
    "equations ( [ eq : kspace ] ) are evaluated for @xmath400 in units of km  s@xmath401 , @xmath501 in @xmath396 , and @xmath260 in kpc ( following bender et al .  and burstein et al . , who originally had galaxies in mind ) .",
    "table [ tab : kappa ] also contains the observed distance , in kpc , of each cluster from the center of its parent galaxy .",
    "these are projected galactocentric radii for the lmc , smc , and fornax clusters , and three - dimensional radii for the milky way globular clusters . for the galactic gcs ,",
    "we have simply copied @xmath499 directly from the catalogue of @xcite . for the lmc , smc , and fornax clusters ,",
    "we have computed @xmath499 ourselves , using the right ascensions and declinations of the clusters as given by @xcite and taking the galaxy centers to be @xmath511 the hi and optical centers of the lmc are offset from each other , and here we have more or less arbitrarily adopted the optical center of the bar from @xcite .",
    "the smc center is taken from @xcite , and the fornax center from simbad . in converting angular distances to kpc ,",
    "we assume a constant distance of 50.1 kpc to all clusters in the lmc ; 60.0 kpc to the smc ; and 137 kpc to fornax .",
    "we have fit three distinct dynamical models to @xmath2-band surface - brightness profiles for each of 68 massive star clusters ( 50 of which have young ages , between several myr and a few gyr ) in the lmc , smc , and fornax dwarf spheroidal , and to 85 old globular clusters in the milky way .",
    "we have also applied publicly available population - synthesis models to infer the expected intrinsic @xmath244 colors ( and thus reddenings ) and @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratios for all of these clusters plus another 63 galactic globulars .",
    "combining these with the surface - brightness model fits , we have calculated a wide range of structural and dynamical parameters characterizing the clusters .",
    "our main results are contained in tables [ tab : poptable ] , [ tab : basic ] , [ tab : struc ] , [ tab : dyn ] , and [ tab : kappa ] above .",
    "we have also taken velocity - dispersion measurements from the literature for a subset of the full cluster sample and calculated dynamical mass - to - light ratios for comparison with the predicted population - synthesis values .",
    "the results of this are in table [ tab : popvdyn ] , which shows quite good agreement in general .",
    "the @xmath2-band surface - brightness data we have employed for lmc , smc , and fornax star clusters derive primarily from hst - based starcounts made in the inner regions by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* collectively mg03 ) .",
    "we have supplemented these wherever possible with ground - based starcounts and @xmath512 aperture photometry from the literature , both to extend the mg03 cluster profiles to larger projected radii and to re - calibrate the @xmath2-band magnitude scale of mg03 .",
    "this re - calibration turns out to be rather significant , amounting to several tenths of a magnitude ( in the sense that the surface brightnesses published in mg03 are generally too faint ) in many cases .",
    "full details of our analyses on the 68 mg03 clusters are in  [ subsec : mackey ] ; the re - calibrated surface - brightness profiles , with all ground - based data properly incorporated , are given in table [ tab : profs ] .",
    "all surface - brightness profiles for milky way globular clusters were taken from the database constructed by @xcite , with only minor modifications described in ",
    "[ subsec : trager ] .",
    "our population - synthesis modeling , which includes a comparison of results from two separate codes @xcite using a variety of assumed stellar imfs , is described in  [ sec : popsyn ] .",
    "table [ tab : poptable ] lists intrinsic cluster colors and theoretical mass - to - light ratios obtained with six different code+imf combinations , although for our subsequent modeling ( requiring estimates of cluster @xmath2-band extinctions and conversions between luminosity and mass ) we adopted numbers from the code of @xcite using the disk - star imf of @xcite . as described in  [ subsec : results ] , we have thus obtained systematically lower predicted mass - to - light ratios , at any age , than mg03 inferred for their lmc / smc / fornax clusters .",
    "our values nevertheless compare well with the dynamical mass - to - light ratios calculated directly from velocity - dispersion measurements for 57 clusters ( mostly old globulars ) in  [ sec : dynml ] .",
    "additionally , our model - based extinctions agree very well with direct measurements for the old globular clusters in the galaxy and the fornax dwarf .",
    "the three models that we fit to each cluster are described in some detail in  [",
    "sec : modeling ] , which also contains the fits themselves and the bulk of our derived structural and dynamical parameters .",
    "the models are : ( 1 ) the single - mass , isotropic , modified isothermal sphere of @xcite ; ( 2 ) an asymptotic power law with a constant - density core ; and ( 3 ) an alternate modification of the isothermal sphere ( still single - mass and isotropic ) based on the stellar distribution function developed by @xcite . for otherwise similar clusters ( e.g. ,",
    "given a fixed total luminosity , central surface brightness , and effective radius ) , @xcite spheres are spatially more extended than @xcite models , although both have finite tidal radii ; the untruncated power - law models we fit are formally infinite in extent and , in some cases , barely convergent in their integrated properties .",
    "even so , the structural differences between these models are most important at relatively large clustercentric distances , in the outer halos beyond a few effective radii . as a result ,",
    "we have verified (  [ subsec : fitcomp ] ) that for _ most _ clusters , _ most _ of the physical properties we have calculated are reasonably well constrained no matter which particular model is taken to fit the surface - brightness data .",
    "we have looked with particular interest at the question of which of the three fits  the spatially limited king model ; a more extended but still finite wilson sphere ; or an infinite power - law model  provides the best description of these clusters in a @xmath247 sense ( see  [ subsubsec : goodness ] ) .",
    "_ all _ of the 68 lmc , smc , and fornax clusters from mg03 are fit _ at least _ as well , and in several cases significantly better , by the larger envelopes of @xcite models rather than the more compact @xcite models .",
    "this is true for the 18 old globular clusters as well as of the 50 younger objects in this sample .",
    "it also holds for the majority ( @xmath513 ) of the old galactic globulars to which we have fit all three models ; a particularly clear example is provided by @xmath7 centauri (  [ subsubsec : wcen ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "asymptotic power laws are not vast improvements over the wilson - model fits ; in fact , they are somewhat worse for many clusters .    in the lmc , smc , and fornax sample especially ( where the surface - brightness data are most homogeneous )",
    ", there is no correlation between cluster age and the relative quality of fit for king vs.  wilson or power - law models .",
    "instead , we have shown that the primary factor in determining whether an extended - halo model describes a cluster better than a @xcite model is simply the spatial extent of the available surface - brightness data being fit .",
    "specifically , it is only when a cluster s observed density profile reaches to more than @xmath5145 effective radii that it becomes possible to decide conclusively whether or not it has a non - king envelope structure ; and when such data do exist , a more distended but finite wilson model is most often the better option of the three we have examined  whatever the cluster age .    thus , we conclude that the extended halos which are known to surround many young massive star clusters in the magellanic clouds and other galaxies _ do not require _ description by untruncated power laws which would necessarily have all the clusters overfill the roche lobes defined by their parent galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) although whether or not this does happen in individual cases is a complicated question that we have not undertaken to address here .",
    "more generally , despite the ad hoc nature of the wilson and power - law models that we have fit , it is a clear fact that self - gravitating clusters _ commonly _ have envelope structures which do not match the extrapolations of simple @xcite models fitting the cluster cores .",
    "this phenomenon is not confined exclusively to young clusters and is not obviously only transient ; it may point instead to generic , internal cluster physics not captured by king s stellar distribution function .",
    "this interesting issue aside , the work we have presented provides the basic information required to define and compare physical parameter correlations and the fundamental plane(s ) of young and old massive star clusters in the milky way , lmc , smc , and fornax .",
    "it also offers a starting point for careful examination of potential model - dependent artifacts in these correlations , and ultimately it should allow for direct contact to be made with the well - established fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies and bulges .",
    "we plan to address these issues in future work .",
    "we thank dougal mackey for providing his lmc , smc , and fornax cluster data to us in electronic form , and for helpful discussions .",

    "<S> we present a database of structural and dynamical properties for 153 spatially resolved star clusters in the milky way , the large and small magellanic clouds , and the fornax dwarf spheroidal . </S>",
    "<S> this database complements and extends others in the literature , such as those of @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our cluster sample comprises 50 `` young massive clusters '' in the lmc and smc , and 103 old globular clusters between the four galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters we list include central and half - light averaged surface brightnesses and mass densities ; core and effective radii ; central potentials , concentration parameters , and tidal radii ; predicted central velocity dispersions and escape velocities ; total luminosities , masses , and binding energies ; central phase - space densities ; half - mass relaxation times ; and `` @xmath0-space '' parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we use publicly available population - synthesis models to compute stellar - population properties ( intrinsic @xmath1 colors , reddenings , and @xmath2-band mass - to - light ratios ) for the same 153 clusters plus another 63 globulars in the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> we also take velocity - dispersion measurements from the literature for a subset of 57 ( mostly old ) clusters to derive dynamical mass - to - light ratios for them , showing that these compare very well to the population - synthesis predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the combined dataset is intended to serve as the basis for future investigations of structural correlations and the fundamental plane of massive star clusters , including especially comparisons between the systemic properties of young and old clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> the structural and dynamical parameters are derived from fitting three different models  the modified isothermal sphere of @xcite ; an alternate modified isothermal sphere based on the ad hoc stellar distribution function of @xcite ; and asymptotic power - law models with constant - density cores  to the surface - brightness profile of each cluster . </S>",
    "<S> surface - brightness data for the lmc , smc , and fornax clusters are based in large part on the work of @xcite , but include significant supplementary data culled from the literature and important corrections to mackey & gilmore s @xmath2-band magnitude scale . </S>",
    "<S> the profiles of galactic globular clusters are taken from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we address the question of which model fits each cluster best , finding in the majority of cases that the wilson models  which are spatially more extended than king models but still include a finite , `` tidal '' cut - off in density  fit clusters of any age , in any galaxy , as well as or better than king models . </S>",
    "<S> untruncated , asymptotic power laws often fit about as well as wilson models but can be significantly worse . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the extended halos known to characterize many magellanic cloud clusters may be examples of the _ generic _ envelope structure of self - gravitating star clusters , not just transient features associated strictly with young age . </S>"
