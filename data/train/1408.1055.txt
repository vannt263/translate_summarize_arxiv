    "the two pair states are separated in energy by several tens of ghz , and thus the effect of the dipolar coupling is negligible . in contrast , in the first case , the two pair states are always degenerate , and thus the dipolar coupling is resonant .",
    "moreover , for those pair states , we always have @xmath127 ( since the two atoms just exchange their states ) , so only the first term in ( [ eq : vdipsph ] ) survives . therefore",
    ", when restricted to the two pair states @xmath143 , the interaction hamiltonian takes the simple form : @xmath144 or , in a matrix form in the basis @xmath145 : @xmath146 there , @xmath147 .",

    "now , in the context of spin hamiltonians , it is desirable to rewrite the pseudo - spin operators in terms of the pauli matrices .",
    "a first step towards this is then to denote the single - atom operators @xmath148 as @xmath149 , and we end up with @xmath150 where @xmath151 , and @xmath152 stands for hermitian conjugate . in eq .",

    "to investigate the origin of the reduced contrast and damping of the oscillations in our experiment , we solve the optical bloch equations ( obes ) for the system of three atoms in the basis spanned by the states @xmath158 . by including the ground state @xmath45",
    "we can account for imperfections in the preparation of the initial configuration due to both spontaneous emission through the intermediate state , and the presence of the always resonant dipole - dipole interaction between the states @xmath68 and @xmath27 .",
    "we simulate the full experimental sequence , including the optical and microwave pulses to the rydberg states , the time evolution under the _ xy _ hamiltonian [ ( 1 ) of the main text ] , and the final state readout .",

    "all the parameters , i.e. , the single - atom rabi frequencies @xmath177 , laser detunings @xmath178 , and dampings @xmath171 are measured independently by recording single - atom rabi oscillations on each site of the array .",
    "the final result of the simulation is obtained by averaging the solution of the obes over 100 realizations , starting from random atom positions @xmath100 , @xmath179 , with rms value @xmath180 nm ( where @xmath181 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath182 khz is the measured radial frequency of the atoms of mass @xmath183 in the trap ) , and velocities @xmath101 , @xmath184 ( rms @xmath185 nm/@xmath34s ) .",
    "in our experiment , the outcome of every realization is a binary state : either the atom is recaptured or it has escaped the trapping region at the end of the sequence .",
    "if the atom is recaptured we assume it is in the ground state . on the contrary , a loss in interpreted as the atom being in a rydberg state ( @xmath22 or @xmath25 ) , since rydberg atoms are not trapped in our tweezers .",
    "however , due to the finite temperature ( @xmath186k ) of the atoms and collisions with the background gas , any atom has a probability @xmath187 to be lost during a sequence of total length @xmath106 , independently of its internal state [ ref 20 of the main text ] .",
    "therefore , there exists a probability to falsely detect the state of the atom , which increases with the length of the sequence . for a single atom ,",
    "the recapture probability @xmath57 is therefore @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the actual probability for the atom to be in the ground state . in the case of a loss",
    ", @xmath190 is related to the actual rydberg state populations @xmath191 and @xmath192 by @xmath193 . as an example , in the case of three atoms the relation between the observed recapture probability @xmath55 and the actual state populations @xmath194 ( @xmath195 ) reads : @xmath196\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to measure @xmath197 , we perform an experiment where we trap three ground state atoms in the line , switch the trap off for a variable duration @xmath106 , and measure the populations at the end of the sequence .",
    "we extract @xmath197 from a polynomial fit of the measured @xmath198 , where @xmath199 .",
    "we then evaluate the evolution of the rest of the recapture probabilities : @xmath200 the comparison of the calculated recapture probabilities ( solid lines in fig .",
    "s1 ) with the experimental test supports the consistency of our loss model .",
    "in fig . 2(b ) of the main text , the measured contrast of the oscillations in the populations @xmath63 and @xmath62 is around @xmath71 . this reduced contrast arises from two effects .",
    "the first one is imperfections in the preparation of the state @xmath68 mainly due to ( i ) inefficient optical pumping of the atoms in the state @xmath45 and ( ii ) spontaneous emission from the intermediate state @xmath41 to the states @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "the second effect is that during the second and third optical pulses , of typical duration 100  ns , one can not neglect totally the effect of the dipolar interactions between states @xmath68 and @xmath204 : the interaction - induced energy splitting between the two states is then 0.6  mhz , yielding a phase accumulation of @xmath205 rad , which is not totally negligible .",
    "the same effect also occurs for three atoms , as described in the main text . the full simulation ( following the approach described in sections s.2 and s.3 above ) of the two - atom system reproduces well the observed data .",
    "the evolution of the system of three spins aligned along a chain coupled by long range dipole - dipole interactions is displayed in fig .",
    "we show , additionally , the probabilities not shown for clarity in fig . 3 of the main text .",
    "solid lines are the result of the simulation through the obes as described in section s.1 . , where we also include the loss - error correction ( section s.2 . ) .",
    "the atom loss effect is clearly visible in the probability @xmath206 at long interaction times .",
    "this effect further reduces the contrast of the oscillations for the populations @xmath55 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the overall agreement of the simulations is very good , supporting the possibility to extend the experiments to larger two dimensional systems .",
    "in an attempt to investigate the limitations of the finite temperature of the atoms in the observed spin dynamics , especially in view of experiments with larger number of atoms , we simulate the evolution of the system at @xmath207k . the temperature of the atoms enters the simulation in ( i ) the rms extension of the random atomic positions and velocities in the time - dependent dipolar couplings , and ( ii ) the atom recapture probability @xmath208 . to include ( i ) we perform monte - carlo simulations of the trajectories of the single atoms , taking into account the expected energy distribution of an atom in the trap  @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "s3 , where we compare the simulation for @xmath209k ( solid lines ) with the curves obtained at @xmath210k ( dashed lines ) . in this case",
    "the damping of the oscillations are drastically reduced for times longer than @xmath211s .",
    "this suggests that a reduction of the temperature of the atoms by only one order of magnitude would be enough to make motional effects negligible for the timescales used in the experiment , so as to enable the nearly ideal quantum simulation of larger spin systems .",
    "considering the temperature of the atoms as the main source of dephasing in the excitation dynamics , we now explore its effect for a larger spin chain .",
    "we simulate the evolution of a system of @xmath212 atoms in a line , separated by @xmath213 m under the hamiltonian ( 1 ) ( main text ) . in fig .",
    "s4 we show the results for two different atom temperatures , @xmath214k ( a ) , and for @xmath215k ( b ) .",
    "the simulation assumes perfect preparation of the initial state @xmath216 ( imperfect preparation would reduce the overall amplitude of the oscillations , but would not induce any extra loss of coherence ) and accounts for temperature effects through both ( i ) time - dependent distances @xmath217 appearing in the dipolar couplings and ( ii ) the finite recapture probability @xmath197 ( as discussed in the previous sections ) . to account for ( ii ) we scale the obtained excitation probability by the factor @xmath218^{n-1}$ ] .",
    "dephasing in the dynamics is appreciable for interaction times longer than @xmath211s , but still allows for an unambiguous observation of the spin dynamics .",
    "this means that even with the finite temperature of the atoms in our tweezers , motional effects should not prevent the observation of coherent spin exchange in larger systems .",
    "therefore , as stated in the conclusion of the main text , it is the stochastic character of the atom loading into the traps which is currently the main limitation for scalability , and we plan to explore several quasi - deterministic loading schemes that have already been demonstrated in other groups ( refs .",

    "<S> the traps are switched off and the atoms are thus in free flight with their initial velocity . </S>",
    "<S> when solving the optical bloch equations , we thus first draw the initial positions @xmath100 and velocities @xmath101 of each atom  @xmath7 according to a thermal distribution , and use time - dependent dipolar couplings @xmath102 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dd ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we then average the results over 100 realizations . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a dephasing of the oscillations , resulting in a significant contrast reduction at long times .    </S>",
    "<S> a second effect of the temperature is that an atom has a small probability @xmath103 to leave the trap region during the experiment . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , we mistakenly infer that it was in a rydberg state at the end of the sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a small distortion of the measured populations @xmath104 ( @xmath105 )  @xcite , that we compute from the actual ones as described in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we measure @xmath103 ( which increases with the duration @xmath106 of the sequence , from @xmath107 at @xmath108 up to @xmath109 for @xmath110 ) in a calibration experiment , and then use it to calculate the expected populations from the simulated ones @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows how those two consequences of the finite temperature contribute to the observed damping in the dynamics of @xmath92 : both have sizable effects , but the dephasing due to fluctuations in the coupling dominates at long times . reducing the atomic temperature using e.g. raman cooling  @xcite would render those effects negligible for our time scales , and allow the realization of a nearly ideal quantum simulator of spin dynamics .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have measured the dynamics of a spin excitation in a minimal spin chain of three rydberg atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the system is accurately described by an _ </S>",
    "<S> xy _ </S>",
    "<S> hamiltonian without any adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained results are encouraging in view of scaling up the system to a larger number of spins . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the residual motion of the atoms and the level of detection errors would already allow us to observe unambiguously the back - and - forth propagation of an excitation over a chain of @xmath111 atoms  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , so far , experiments with more than @xmath112 atoms are hampered by the stochastic loading of the traps by single atoms  @xcite . in future work </S>",
    "<S> , we will thus explore various quasideterministic loading schemes that have been demonstrated at the level of a single  @xcite or a few  @xcite traps . </S>",
    "<S> once this is achieved , our system will allow us to study the equivalent of an assembly of hard - core bosons on a 2d lattice with long - range , anisotropic hopping . </S>",
    "<S> we will also study dipolar interactions involving more than only two rydberg states at an electrically tuned frster resonance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our system will be ideal to study exotic phases and frustration in quantum magnetism , excitation hopping in complex networks @xcite or quantum walks with long - range hopping @xcite .    </S>",
