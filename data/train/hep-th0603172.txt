    "one of the main phenomenological attractions of using d - branes is that they permit a `` bottom - up '' approach to constructing the standard model from type ii string theory .",
    "open strings that begin and end on a stack @xmath6 of @xmath12 d - branes generate the gauge bosons of a ( supersymmetric ) @xmath13 gauge theory living in the world volume of the d - branes . in the original bottom - up models",
    "@xcite a stack of d3-branes is placed at an orbifold @xmath14 singularity and the standard model gauge group ( possibly augmented by additional @xmath15 factors ) is obtained by choosing a suitable embedding @xmath16 of the action of the generator @xmath17 of the orbifold point group @xmath18 on the chan - paton indices of the d3-branes . besides the gauge bosons , fermionic matter also survives the orbifold projection .",
    "so long as only d3-branes are retained , the fermion spectrum generally makes the non - abelian gauge symmetries anomalous , reflecting the fact that a general collection of d3-branes has uncancelled ramond - ramond ( rr ) tadpoles .",
    "the required cancellation is achieved by introducing d7-branes , which generate further gauge symmetries , and additional fermions . when all tadpoles are cancelled , so are the gauge anomalies .",
    "however , we showed in an earlier paper @xcite that all such models , whether utilising fixed points on an orbifold or an orientifold , have electroweak higgs content that is non - minimal , both for the ( non - supersymmetric ) standard model or its supersymmetric extension , the mssm . as a consequence",
    "there is a generic flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) problem in such models , and we conclude that such models are not realistic .",
    "( see , however , @xcite , which argues that a supersymmetric , standard - like model with three higgs doublets , derived from compactifying the @xmath19 heterotic string on a @xmath20 orbifold , _ can _ circumvent the fcnc problem without an excessively heavy higgs sector . )    an alternative approach that also uses d - branes is `` intersecting brane '' model building @xcite . in these models",
    "one starts with two stacks , @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , of d4- , d5- or d6-branes wrapping the three large spatial dimensions plus respectively 1- , 2- and 3-cycles of the six - dimensional internal space ( typically a torus @xmath23 or a calabi - yau 3-fold ) on which the theory is compactified .",
    "these generate the gauge group @xmath24 , and the non - abelian component of the standard model gauge group is immediately assured .",
    "further , ( four - dimensional ) fermions in bifundamental representations @xmath25 of the gauge group can arise at the multiple intersections of the two stacks .",
    "these are precisely the representations needed for the quark doublets @xmath26 of the standard model .",
    "for d4- and d5-branes , to get _ chiral _ fermions the stacks must be at a singular point of the transverse space .",
    "in general , intersecting branes yield a non - supersymmetric spectrum , so that , to avoid the hierarchy problem , the string scale associated with such models must be low , no more than a few tev . then",
    ", the high energy ( planck ) scale associated with gravitation does not emerge naturally .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that these problems can be surmounted @xcite , and indeed an attractive model having just the spectrum of the standard model has been constructed @xcite .",
    "it uses d6-branes that wrap 3-cycles of an orientifold @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the world - sheet parity operator . the advantage and , indeed",
    ", the necessity of using an orientifold stems from the fact that for every stack @xmath29 there is an orientifold image @xmath30 . at intersections of @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "there are chiral fermions in the @xmath31 representation of @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 has charge @xmath34 with respect to the @xmath35 in @xmath36 , and the @xmath37 has charge @xmath38 with respect to the @xmath39 in @xmath40 .",
    "however , at intersections of @xmath6 and @xmath9 there are chiral fermions in the @xmath41 representation , where the @xmath42 has @xmath39 charge @xmath43 . in the model of @xcite ,",
    "the number of intersections @xmath5 of the stack @xmath6 with @xmath7 is 2 , and the number of intersections @xmath8 of the stack @xmath6 with @xmath9 is 1 .",
    "thus , as required for the , there are 3 quark doublets .",
    "these have net @xmath35 charge @xmath44 , and net @xmath39 charge @xmath45 .",
    "tadpole cancellation requires that overall both charges , sum to zero , so further fermions are essential , and indeed required by the .",
    "6 quark - singlet states @xmath46 and @xmath47 belonging to the @xmath48 representation of @xmath49 , having a total of @xmath50 are sufficient to ensure overall cancellation of @xmath51 , and these arise from the intersections of @xmath6 with other stacks @xmath52 having just a single d6-brane .",
    "similarly , 3 lepton doublets @xmath53 , belonging to the @xmath54 representation of @xmath55 , having a total @xmath39 charge of @xmath56 , are sufficient to ensure overall cancellation of @xmath57 , and these arise from the intersections of @xmath7 with other stacks having just a single d6-brane .",
    "in contrast , had we not used an orientifold , the requirement of 3 quark doublets would necessitate having the number of intersections @xmath58 .",
    "this makes no difference to the charge @xmath44 carried by the quark doublets , but instead the @xmath39 charge carried by the quark doublets is @xmath59 , which can not be cancelled by just 3 lepton doublets @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , additional vector - like fermions are unavoidable unless the orientifold projection is available .",
    "this is why the orientifold is essential if we are to get just the matter content of the  or of the mssm .",
    "actually , an orientifold can allow the standard - model spectrum without vector - like matter even when @xmath58 and @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this is because in orientifold models it is also possible to get chiral matter in the symmetric and/or antisymmetric representation of the relevant gauge group from open strings stretched between a stack and its orientifold image .",
    "both representations have charge @xmath61 with respect to the relevant @xmath15 .",
    "the antisymmetric ( singlet ) representation of @xmath62 can describe a lepton single state @xmath63 , and 3 copies contribute @xmath64 units of @xmath39 charge .",
    "if there are also 3 lepton doublets @xmath53 belonging to the bifundamental representation @xmath54 representation of @xmath55 , each contributing @xmath65 as above , then the total contribution is @xmath66 which * can * be cancelled by 3 quark doublets @xmath26 in the @xmath31 representation of @xmath32 .",
    "thus , as asserted , orientifold models can allow just the standard - model spectrum even when @xmath67 .    despite the attractiveness of the model in @xcite",
    ", there remain serious problems in the absence of supersymmetry .",
    "a generic feature of intersecting brane models is that flavour changing neutral currents are generated by four - fermion operators induced by string instantons @xcite .",
    "the severe experimental limits on these processes require that the string scale is rather high , of order @xmath68 tev .",
    "this makes the fine tuning problem very severe , and the viability of such models highly questionable .",
    "further , in non - supersymmetric theories , such as these , the cancellation of rr tadpoles does not ensure neveu schwarz - neveu schwarz ( nsns ) tadpole cancellation .",
    "nsns tadpoles are simply the first derivative of the scalar potential with respect to the scalar fields , specifically the complex structure and khler moduli and the dilaton .",
    "a non - vanishing derivative of the scalar potential signifies that such scalar fields are not even solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "thus a particular consequence of the non - cancellation is that the complex structure moduli are unstable @xcite .",
    "one way to stabilise these moduli is for the d - branes to wrap an orbifold @xmath69 rather than a torus @xmath23 .",
    "the fcnc problem can be solved and the complex structure moduli stabilised when the theory is supersymmetric .",
    "first , a supersymmetric theory is not obliged to have the low string scale that led to problematic fcncs induced by string instantons .",
    "second , in a supersymmetric theory , rr tadpole cancellation ensures cancellation of the nsns tadpoles @xcite .",
    "an orientifold is then constructed by quotienting the orbifold with the world - sheet parity operator @xmath28 .",
    "( as explained above , an orientifold is necessary to allow the possibility of obtaining just the spectrum of the supersymmetric standard model . )",
    "several attempts to construct the mssm using d6-branes and a @xmath70 , @xmath71@xmath72 or @xmath73 orientifold have been made @xcite .",
    "the most successful attempt to date is the last of these @xcite , which uses d6-branes intersecting on a @xmath73 orientifold to construct an @xmath74 supersymmetric standard - like model using 5 stacks of branes .",
    "we shall not discuss this beautiful model in any detail except to note that the intersection numbers for the stacks @xmath6 , which generates the @xmath3 group , and @xmath7 , which generates the @xmath4 , are @xmath75 . in this case",
    "it is impossible to obtain lepton singlet states @xmath63 as antisymmetric representations of @xmath62 .",
    "further , it was shown , quite generally , that it is impossible to find stacks @xmath6 and @xmath7 such that @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "thus , as explained above , it is impossible to obtain exactly the ( supersymmetric )  spectrum .",
    "the question then arises as to whether the use of a different orientifold could circumvent this problem . in this paper",
    "we address this question for the @xmath1 orientifold .",
    "we do not attempt to construct a standard(-like ) mssm .",
    "instead , we merely see whether there are any stacks @xmath2 that simultaneously satisfy the supersymmetry constraints , the absence of chiral matter in symmetric representations of the gauge groups ( see below ) , which have not too much chiral matter in antisymmetric representations of the gauge groups ( see below ) , and which have @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "we do not pursue the alternative that @xmath78 or @xmath79 , since such models , with 3 lepton singlet states arising on the @xmath62 stack , do not have the standard - model couplings of these states to the higgs multiplet .",
    "with @xmath80 we explained above why @xmath81 is sufficient to ensure that no vector - like matter is necessary to ensure that the net @xmath39 charge @xmath57 is zero , and the same is obviously the true if @xmath82 ; it amounts to interchanging @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "intersection numbers @xmath83 or @xmath84 are equally acceptable , since negative intersection numbers correspond to opposite chiralities .",
    "thus @xmath85 , where underlining signifies any permutation , is sufficient . for calculational purposes",
    "it is convenient to let _ either _ stack @xmath6 or @xmath7 generate the @xmath3 gauge group , so that @xmath86",
    ". interchanging @xmath6 and @xmath7 gives @xmath87 .",
    "thus the intersection numbers are generally required to satisfy @xmath88 . if @xmath89 and @xmath90 have the same sign , then @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; otherwise @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in what follows we parallel quite closely the treatment @xcite of honecker & ott for the @xmath73 orientifold .",
    "we assume , as is customary , that the torus @xmath23 factorises into three 2-tori @xmath93 .",
    "the three 2-tori @xmath94 are parametrised by three complex coordinates @xmath95 .",
    "the action of the generator @xmath17 of the point group @xmath96 on the coordinates @xmath97 is given by z_k = e^2i v_k z_k where ( v_1,v_2,v_3)= ( 1,2,-3 )  for    _ 6 [ z61vk ] to calculate the number of independent bulk 3-cycles we need the betti number @xmath98 which is the dimension of the third homology group @xmath99 of the space . because of the duality of the homology and cohomology groups we can as well compute the number of independent invariant 3-forms .",
    "then b_3=b^3=_p+q=3 b^p , q where @xmath100 is the number of independent invariant @xmath101 forms , _ i.e._with @xmath102 holomorphic and @xmath103 anti - holomorphic variables . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the invariant forms are @xmath104 ,  @xmath105 and their complex conjugates , so @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "hence , the untwisted sector contributes b^(0)_3(t^6/ _ 6)=4 [ b3z6prime ] to the betti number .",
    "the point group action must be an automorphism of the lattice , so in @xmath108 we may take an @xmath109 lattice .",
    "specifically we define the basis 1-cycles in @xmath108 by @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath112 and @xmath113 and @xmath114 in @xmath115 .",
