    "in a colloidal dispersion , the stability is governed by the balance between van der waals attractive forces and electrostatic repulsive forces , together with steric mechanisms .",
    "being able to model their interplay is of utmost importance to predict the conditions for colloidal stability , which in turn is of major interest in basic research and for industrial applications .",
    "complex fluids are composed typically at least of one or more solvents , polymeric or non - polymeric surfactants , and crystalline substrates onto which these surfactants adsorb .",
    "neutral polymer adsorption has been extensively studied using mean - field approximations and assuming an adsorbed polymer configuration of loops and tails  @xcite .",
    "different mechanisms of adsorption affecting the global stability of a colloidal dispersion , including surface - modifying polymer chains _ versus _ end - grafted polymer chains , have been studied in  @xcite .",
    "attempts to measure the forces themselves that act in a confined complex fluid in thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings have been made using atomic force microscopy ( cf .",
    ", e.g. ,  @xcite ) , while it has been argued  @xcite that it is more appropriate to use the concept of disjoining pressure , which is the difference between the force ( per colloidal particle unit area ) normal to the conning surfaces and the fluid s bulk pressure .",
    "this disjoining pressure allows for a direct determination of the free energy of interaction , hence its importance .",
    "polyelectrolyte solutions have very different properties from those observed in solutions of uncharged polymers , and their behaviour is less well known  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is not evident that the scaling of some quantities present a similar behaviour as that of electrically neutral solutions , or that they present the same or similar scaling exponents .",
    "calculating langmuir isotherms for polyacrylate dispersants adsorbed on metallic oxides , and their scaling properties as a function of the number of monomeric dispersant units obtained via dissipative particle dynamycs ( dpd ) simulations , it has been shown  @xcite that the critical exponent for the renormalized isotherms agrees perfectly well with the scaling theory in  @xcite even though polyelectrolytes were being considered .    due to the long - range coulombic repulsion produced by the presence of small mobile counterions in the bulk ,",
    "the properties of these systems can not in general be obtained analytically .",
    "the most usual systems are even more complex , encompassing various surfactants of different chemical nature and molecular weight ( acting as dispersants , wetting agents , rheology modifiers , e tc . ) , pigments , `` inert '' extenders , and so on . in all these cases there",
    "are various different length and dynamic scales , every species interact with all others at a molecular level , in a way which is dependent on temperature and concentration .",
    "there is , further , competitive adsorption amongst all surfactants present .",
    "ideally , one should have a basic understanding of all interactions , but the main problem is that all colloidal systems are thermodynamically unstable .",
    "empirical methods have been used as well as few and greatly approximated analytic models , and a more recent and promising method is that of _ molecular dynamics simulations_. its basic methodology consists of taking advantage of the fast computing facilities that are nowadays available , to integrate newtons equations of motion for a large number @xmath0 of particle ( molecules , atoms , or whatever the problem in turn calls for ) .",
    "thus , one sets initial positions @xmath1 and momenta @xmath2 for each particle @xmath3 at time @xmath4 , and uses the force field felt by each one of them @xmath5 to find its new position and momentum at time @xmath6 iteratively .",
    "the approximation being made is to consider the potential @xmath7 to be constant during the time step @xmath8 which , if taken very small , can make the error negligible .",
    "typical choices for the force field are the electrostatic interaction @xmath9 and a lennard - jones type potential @xmath10 $ ] , where the adjustable parameters @xmath11 must be obtained by other means ( first principles or experimentation ) .",
    "relevant quantities of the system are computed as time - averages over a macroscopic time interval @xmath12\\ , dt'\\ .\\ ] ]    the pieces of information that one can obtain through these simulations are mainly structural and thermodynamic properties : _",
    "i ) _ the density profile @xmath13 , which in particular may be used to characterise when two phases ( e.g. liquid and vapour ) coexist ; _ ii ) _ the radial distribution function @xmath14 given by @xmath15 which measures the average number of particles in each coordination shell with respect to a given centre ( and usually obtained through x - ray or neutron scattering experiments ) ; _ iii ) _ the interfacial tension @xmath16      \\label{interfacial}\\ ] ] obtained from the pressure tensor components @xmath17 within a box of length @xmath18 ; _ iv ) _ the radius of gyration of a polymer chain , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is proportional to the flory volume , @xmath21 is the monomer length of the chain , and @xmath22 is the appropriate scaling exponent ; _ v ) _ phase diagrams ; _ vi ) _ adsorption isotherms ; _ vii ) _ disjoining pressures ; etc . figure  [ fig1 ] shows descriptively this methodology .",
    "by its nature , microscopic molecular dynamics simulations require a great deal of computational resources , the reason being that the integration of the equations of motion require very small time steps when the interaction potential changes significantly over small distances . an alternative that has proven to be very successful is to do mesoscopic modelling via _ dissipative particle dynamics _ ( dpd )  @xcite , consisting of carrying out a coarse - graining of the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "it is highly dependent on parameters describing the different kinds of force fields , the parametrisation of which are not always clear in the literature . for this reason ,",
    "we present here a revision of dpd parametrisation together with applications and comparison with experimental results .    in section 2",
    "we give a brief description of the dpd modelling , including _",
    "electrostatic _ dpd .",
    "section 3 deals with the appropriate parametrisation and how to calculate the relevant parameters for given realistic systems .",
    "the dependence on concentration and temperature of the interaction parameters is also considered .",
    "section 4 presents some interesting applications , and we close with some conclusions .",
    "a good alternative to overcome the difficulties presented by molecular dynamics simulations is to do a coarse - graining of the microscopic degrees of freedom . when done carefully , results can be obtained which approximate very well those obtained through lengthy experimentation ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the method of dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) , introduced by hoogerbrugge and koelman  @xcite , consists of grouping several molecules , or parts of molecules , in a representative way , into soft mesoscopic `` particles '' . as with molecular dynamics simulations , one integrates the equations of motion to obtain the particle s positions and velocities , but here one distinguishes only between @xmath23 contributions to the total force : _ conservative _ , _ dissipative _ and _ random_.    conservative forces account for local hydrostatic pressure and are of the form @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is a parameter which represents the maximum repulsion between particles @xmath3 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the position of particle @xmath3 , and the weight function is given by @xmath31 .",
    "this force , depicted in figure  [ fig2 ] , derives from a soft interaction potential and there is no hard - core divergence as in the case of the lennard - jones potential , which makes more efficient the scheme of integration since it allows for a large time step . in the case of macromolecules , such as polymers , the particles (",
    "which can consist of representative monomers or sets of monomers ) are joined by springs with a spring constant @xmath32 , so we have an extra conservative force of the form @xmath33 whenever particle @xmath3 is connected to particle @xmath26 .",
    "dissipative forces account for the local viscosity of the medium , and are of the form @xmath34\\,\\hat{\\bm{e}}_{ij}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the relative velocity , @xmath36 the dissipation constant , and @xmath37 a dimensionless weight function .",
    "finally , the random ( thermal ) force disperses heat produced by the dissipative force and invests it into brownian motion in order to keep the temperature @xmath38 locally constant .",
    "it is of the form @xmath39 with @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the integration time - step and @xmath42 is a random gaussian number with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "a dimensionless weight function @xmath43 also appears .",
    "not all three forces are independent .",
    "the fact that the random force compensates the energy dissipated in order to keep @xmath38 constant means that it acts as a regulating thermostat .",
    "this leads to the _ fluctuation - dissipation _",
    "theorem  @xcite which gives @xmath44 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath45 boltzmann s constant .    when dealing with electrically charged species , such as polyelectrolytes , a problem with the dpd methodology , arising from the fact that the interactions are soft , is the artificial formation of ionic clusters .",
    "electric charges are usually treated as point charges whose potential diverges at their position in space . in  @xcite this problem",
    "is solved by considering charge distributions over the dpd - particles .",

    "@xcite ) .    the various parameters introduced , viz .",
    "@xmath59 , contain all the information of the particular system being considered .",
    "it is therefore crucial , for the dpd methodology to work , to be able to establish these parameters faithfully .",
    "by far the most important parameter is the one defining the conservative force , @xmath25 , because it contains all the physicochemical information for each component in the system .",
    "in contrast , the noise and dissipative parameters correspond to the temperature and fluid viscosity respectively . in a mono - component system the conservative force parameter for equal species",
    "@xmath60 relates to the inverse isothermal compressibility  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number density of molecules and @xmath63 is the usual isothermal compressibility .",
    "the pressure @xmath64 in the system may be obtained using the viral theorem , obtaining @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the density and @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "we then have @xmath69 . if @xmath70 is the number of molecules contained in a dpd particle , then @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the dpd number density for the system and is usually set to @xmath73 ( three water molecules per mesoscopic particle in an aqueous solution , for example ) . for the mono - component system the virial free energy density @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 .",

    "this exacting single occupancy is relaxed to a site occupancy probability , which gives a mean - field free energy of mixing constituted by a combinatorial entropy and a mean - field energy of mixing @xmath85 .",
    "the free energy per unit volume for a mixture of two polymers @xmath77 and @xmath78 could then be written as @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 the number of monomers of species @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , and @xmath89 . the first two terms on the right hand side contain the information of the energy of the pure components and correspond to the entropic contribution @xmath90 .",
    "the third one involves the excess energy produced by the mixture ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the @xmath92-parameter tells us how alike the two phases are , and is known as the _ flory - huggins interaction parameter_. in the mean - field theory this parameter is written in terms of the nearest - neighbor interaction energies @xmath93 as @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the lattice coordination number .",
    "it is a phenomenological parameter , and corrections considering an ionisation equilibrium between counterions and electrolyte are needed in the presence of long - range forces .",
    "but one can also estimate this quantity by using the hildebrand - scatchard regular solution theory  @xcite , in which the entropy of mixing is given by an ideal expression but the enthalpy of mixing is non - zero and is the next simplest approximation to the ideal solution . in this approach",
    "one can appropriately consider the coulombic contribution in the enthalpy of mixing via the activity coefficients in electrolyte solutions ( _ vide infra _ ) .    whereas the fh mean - field theory considers @xmath96 as proportional to @xmath97 but independent of the solute concentration @xmath98 , comparisons with experiments",
    "show that phenomenological @xmath96 contains both energetic and entropic contributions ; i.e. , @xmath99 .",
    "a correct parametrisation in our electrostatic dpd system must , therefore , take into account the dependence of the repulsive parameters for the solvated ions @xmath25 with the salt concentration @xmath98 . the way to understand this is as follows : when we perform a coarse graining , the volume of a dpd particle does not usually encompass a full molecule or polymer ; thus , for instance , although for dodecane our dpd particle contains only a butane fragment , one does not construct dodecane from the union of butane particles , and the interaction between the dpd dodecane particles and water does not correspond with the @xmath92 parameter of butane with water ; the @xmath92 parameter employed to estimate the dpd repulsive parameter @xmath25 should be that of the full dodecane molecule because its behaviour is that of the global joined units which affect the electronic distribution throughout . in this case",
    ", the `` monomeric '' units which constitute the dodecane `` polymeric '' molecule interact through short - range ( covalent bond ) forces .",
    "when considering a solvated electrolyte , e.g. @xmath100 or @xmath101 ions , their concentration is given precisely by the amount of solvated ionic particles present , which corresponds effectively with the amount of `` monomeric '' solvated ionic units .",
    "these are in effect the individual dpd units , which in this case are not covalently joined but are subject to long - range electrostatic forces .",
    "the presence and quantity of `` monomeric '' solvated ions affect the global properties of the network and their corresponding @xmath92 parameter should take into account the whole electrolytic entity , and thus a correct parametrisation of the dpd system forces a dependence of the conservative force parameters @xmath25 on the concentration @xmath98 , through @xmath102 .      for an electrolyte solution in water , @xmath103 , the chemical potential @xmath104 for each component ( @xmath105 )",
    "may be obtained by differentiating the free energy per unit volume of the mixture @xmath103 with respect to the number of molecules @xmath106 of the component in question .",
    "thus , @xmath107 where @xmath80 and @xmath108 are the volumetric fractions for the @xmath109 ( solvent ) and @xmath110 ( electrolyte ) components respectively . the activity coefficient for the electrolyte @xmath111 is defined as @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes an arbitrarily chosen zero for the component @xmath110 and is called the _ standard chemical potential _ of @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath92-parameter for the solvent and the electrolyte can be obtained from @xmath111 : @xmath114 and its explicit concentration - dependence comes about by writing @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the stoichiometric coefficients of the cation and the anion , and @xmath118 .",
    "@xmath119 denotes the _ mean _ activity coefficient of the electrolyte , and @xmath120 its molality . equation ( [ concdependentchi ] ) allows one to obtain the flory - huggins concentration - dependent parameter if the activity coefficient is known .",

    "when the heat of mixing is given by the hildebrand - scatchard regular solution theory  @xcite the @xmath132-parameter can be obtained using the solubility parameters @xmath133 for the pure components in the mixture , which themselves are temperature - dependent .",

    "this is because the solubility parameter of the homomorph is due entirely to dispersion forces .",
    "one still needs to determine either @xmath142 or @xmath143 ( the other one is obtained by substraction from the total solubility parameter @xmath144 using eq.([solparam ] ) , when known ) , and this is done through trial and error experimentation on numerous solvents and polymers and comparing similar and dissimilar structures according to functional groups and molecular weight .",
    "the total solubility parameter may be calculated from the cohesive energy @xmath145 or , equivalently , from the enthalpy of vapourisation @xmath146 @xmath147 by using atomistic dynamic simulations .",

    "interfacial tension arises from the contact between immiscible fluids .",

    "we observe the typical oscillations in @xmath206 present in confined fluids  @xcite .",
    "while maxima in @xmath206 correspond to more stable thermodynamic configurations , minima represent regions of instability .",
    "in this case molecules with a molecular weight @xmath207 were considered , corresponding to @xmath208 dpd - particles joined by springs .",
    "having @xmath209 such molecules present amounts to having 140 monomeric units , a concentration that can also be achieved by considering @xmath210 polymeric molecules of @xmath211 of the same chemical type .",
    "polyethylene glycol ( peg ) of @xmath212 and @xmath211 were used for the results in figure  [ dp ] , with a dpd - particle volume of @xmath213 @xmath214 which can accommodate @xmath23 water molecules .",
    "the repulsive wall interaction parameter was chosen as @xmath215 when the particle interacting with the wall was a monomer of the polymer molecule , and as @xmath216 for solvent molecules .",
    "for particles of the same species we took @xmath217 and for particles of different species @xmath218 .",
    "our choices reproduce isothermal compressibility of water at room temperature , and promotes polymer adsorption onto the substrate over solvent adsorption .",
    "for the spring constant in the polymer dpd - particles we took @xmath219 with an equilibrium distance of @xmath220 .",
    "the temperature was kept constant at @xmath221 .",
    "we may observe that shorter polymers are better as dispersants when compared with longer ones at the same monomer concentration .",
    "if we multiply the dimensionless @xmath222 depicted in the figure by @xmath223 ( cf .",
    "eq.([virialpressure ] ) ) , the disjoining pressure for short polymers can be up to @xmath224 pa larger than that for the longer chains at certain wall separations .",
    "stability via surface modification is then much better attained through the use of monomeric species , than through polymer chains .",
    "the same behaviour is found for grafted polymers ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the radius of gyration is a measure of the size of an object of arbitrary shape . for a polymer chain in solution , however , this is not a very useful definition as it can take many different configurations .",
    "one may calculate a _ root mean square end - to - end distance _",
    "@xmath225 of the chain as @xmath226 where we have denoted by @xmath227 the positions of the chain joints ( i.e. , the two ends of the @xmath3-th bond are @xmath228 and @xmath47 ) . a more useful quantity , however , is the _ radius of gyration _",
    "@xmath229 of the chain , given by @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the centre of mass of the chain . loosely speaking ,",
    "the chain occupies the space of a sphere of radius @xmath229 , i.e. , it intuitively gives a sense of the size of the polymer coil .",
    "note that @xmath232 ( with @xmath120 the mass of the polymer molecule ) is the moment of inertia of the molecule about its centre of mass , and that we can write the equation above as @xmath233 which is useful since it allows us to calculate the radius of gyration of the molecule by using the mean square distance between monomers , without calculating @xmath234 .",
    "note also that we have used averaging in all the equations above ; this is because the possible chain conformations are numerous and constantly change in time , thus we understand the radius of gyration as a mean over time of all the polymer molecules , which by ergodicity principles we calculate as an ensemble average .",
    "the radius of gyration can be easily determined experimentally through light scattering or other alternative methods ( neutron scattering , etc . ) , allowing one to check a theoretical model against reality , and this is what makes it an interesting quantity of study .",
    "it has been extensively studied for neutral polymeric species but , as the presence of charges completely changes the possible configurations of the molecules in solution , it is interesting to study the behaviour of @xmath229 in a polyelectrolyte .",
    "one interesting problem is the ph - dependent conformational change of some biopolyelectrolites , because it affects directly the mechanism of action in different situations .",
    "an example of this is the poly(amidoamine ) ( paa ) which is used as endosomolytic biopolymer for intracellular delivery of proteins and genes .",
    "bio - responsive behaviour of these kinds of compounds is related with the structure and conformation in the medium , which could be estimated by the radius of gyration .",
    "this is modified by ph and ionic strength effects .",
    "experimental studies of small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) have been published in order to illustrate the ph - dependency and conformational change of paa isa 23  @xcite .",
    "linear poly(amidoamine ) polymers ( paas ) have amido- and tertiary amino - groups along the main polymer , which gives rise to an interesting ph - dependent conformational change and thus offers a perfect prospect for devising polymers that present membrane activity at low ph .",
    "the neutral structure of this biopolymer is shown in figure  [ isa23](a ) .",
    "the molecular weight of isa23 is @xmath235 g / mol and it has three @xmath236 s : @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "for this reason , the molecule could be in three different ionisation forms as illustrated in figures [ isa23](b ) , [ isa23](c ) , [ isa23](d ) .",
    "electrostatic dpd simulations have been performed  @xcite in order to study the radius of gyration of this molecule and compare with experimental data reported .",
    "the mapping used is showed in figure  [ isamapeo ] .",
    "it was established by taking into account the molar volume of each segment or monomeric unit , and considering the volume of each dpd bead as @xmath240 where @xmath241 is the molar volume of one water molecule .",
    "isa23 could be considered as a weak poly - acid and the ph could be modelled considering its ionisation degree over the polymeric structure .",
    "partial charges are introduced over the molecule considering that the b - dpd bead ( see figure  [ isamapeo ] ) could be neutral or have a charge of @xmath242 .",
    "the c - dpd beads could be neutral or have a positive charge of @xmath243 or @xmath244 depending on the ph of the medium according to the acid - base equilibrium given by    @xmath245 + pka_1 , & \\text{$ph < pka_1 $ } \\\\ \\vspace{0.07 in } \\log\\left [ \\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta } \\right ] + pka_2 , & \\text{$pka_1 < ph < pka_2 $ } \\\\ \\log\\left [ \\frac{1}{1-\\theta } \\right ] + pka_3 , & \\text{$pka_2",
    "< ph < pka_3 $ }      \\end{cases } \\label{ph}\\ ] ]    where @xmath246 is the ratio between the number @xmath247 of protonated - deprotonated monomeric units and the total number @xmath0 of monomeric units , and @xmath248 is the acid - base equilibrium constant .",
    "the variation of ph at constant ionic strength makes available the control of the partial charge over the macromolecule .",
    "the dpd parameters @xmath25 are calculated as described in section  [ parametrisation ] using the solubility parameters obtained by molecular simulation . ionic strength was fixed to @xmath249 and the ph was varied according to equations  [ ph ] .    performing electrostatic dpd simulations at different ph s ,",
    "the mean radius of gyration was calculated for @xmath148 blocks of @xmath250 steps .",
    "the size of the system was @xmath251 .",
    "also , @xmath252 and @xmath253 .",
    "paa isa 23 was represented by @xmath254 dpd beads joined by springs with @xmath255 .",
    "the results , as a function of ph and of @xmath246 , are shown in figures  [ rgvsphisa ] .    according with these simulations , the paa isa 23 radius of gyration increases to a maximum when the ph decreases . at high ph , and therefore high ionic strengths ( because of the counter - ions present in the system ) , the polymer is negatively charged and adopts a rather compact structure . the conformation is shown in figure  [ simisa ] showing how the negative counter - ions ( violet beads in the figure ) are distributed near the extreme of the polymer where the amide group is located and the internal structure is extended at low ph ( @xmath256 ) . at high ph ( @xmath257 )",
    "the positive counter - ions ( orange dpd beads in the figure ) are around the carboxyl extreme .",
    "experimental data reported  @xcite shows a very similar but more complex equilibrium in the system : with decreasing ph , the paa isa 23 radius of gyration increases to a maximum around ph = 3 , after which value a decreasing @xmath229 is observed when the ph is increased . at high ph the polymer",
    "is negatively charged and presents a pretty compact structure presumably . at low ph ,",
    "the coil again collapses , and the author suggests that this is almost certainly due to the effects of the high ionic strength ; this latter behaviour is not observed in figure  [ rgvsphisa ] probably because the ionic strength was fixed at @xmath258 .",
    "scaling and universality are two amazing properties that collectively have generated the modern theory of critical behaviour appearing in different areas of modern physics , such as condensed matter , field theory , plasma physics , complex systems , dynamical systems , and hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the _ universality _",
    "quality means that many different systems present the same critical behaviour , while _ scaling _ , is concerned with the fact that in a neighborhood of a critical point the system is scale invariant .",
    "preserving this symmetry in the system makes it possible to relate physical phenomena which take place at very different length scales . as a consequence",
    ", the correct description of systems near their critical points can be described by _",
    "power laws _ and this kind of behaviour might be analysed by dimensional considerations known as _ scaling laws_. even though the renormalization group ( rg ) approach is a good alternative to obtain in an accurate way the critical exponents  @xcite ,",
    "in many occasions the use of this approach in complex systems is quite difficult . on the other hand ,",
    "numerical simulations allow one to describe in a simpler and more attractive way different complex systems , but the possibility to use numerical simulations near the critical points of a system is still a topic under discussion . _",
    "coarse graining _ is another common concept when we study systems which present scale invariance and , when different scales are involved , the coarse grained simulations have shown to be a very good alternative .",
    "dpd simulations  @xcite is one such coarse graining method and has shown that , if correct parametrisations are used , can reproduce in great detail the scaling properties of different kinds of real systems .",
    "as an example , the scaling exponent observed for the dependence of the interfacial tension @xmath36 with temperature @xmath38 , for several liquid - liquid systems , is given by :    @xmath259    where @xmath260 is a system - dependent constant , @xmath261 is the critical temperature at which the interface becomes unstable , and @xmath262 is a critical exponent which has been found experimentally some years ago to be close to @xmath263  @xcite . according to the hyper - scaling relationship of widom  @xcite , we have @xmath264 where @xmath22 is the scaling exponent for the radius of gyration given in eq .",
    "(  [ rgscaling ] ) , and @xmath265 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "more recently , by renormalization group calculations  @xcite , more accurate results give us @xmath266 , and @xmath267 , which for @xmath268 satisfy the hyper - scaling law .",
    "these results have been reproduced by dpd simulations for different systems  @xcite and are presented in figure  [ scalingtmu ] for a dodecane / water mixture .",
    "another interesting example is the scaling of @xmath269 ( maximum adsorption ) with the number @xmath0 of chain units .",
    "the number of chains of size @xmath0 per unit area , @xmath270 , needed to satisfactorily cover some given amount of material , say @xmath130 mol , can be obtained by performing dpd simulations for the adsorption of polymers with different length @xmath0 and fitting each simulation to a langmuir isotherm .",
    "when @xmath270 vs @xmath0 is plotted , the behaviour shown in figure  [ scaling2 ] is obtained and the scaling function is @xmath271 .",
    "this result is in perfect agreement with the scaling theory in the weak adsorption regime  @xcite , which indicates that at maximum saturation    @xmath272    where @xmath273 is the number of monomers adsorbed in the flat plateau of the isotherm .",
    "this implies @xmath274 as obtained above .",
    "finally , another clear example are the scaling laws observed between the viscosity ( @xmath275 ) and the friction coefficient ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "this behaviour was reproduced by non - equilibrium dpd simulations for sheared polymer chains grafted onto flat surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the scaling laws @xmath276 and @xmath277 at high shear rates @xmath36 were obtained  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate parametrisation for the relevant parameters in dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) simulations were presented .",
    "a clear methodology has been developed in the last few years to obtain the interaction parameters in great detail for realistic systems , making possible the study of their dependence with concentration and temperature .",
    "this work has proven to give predictions in accordance with experimental results .",
