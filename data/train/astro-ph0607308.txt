    "this is the second paper of a two - paper series of radial velocity ( rv ) observations of close binary systems conducted at the european southern observatory in 1996 and 1998 . the first paper ( * ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) presented data obtained on 4 nights in august 1998 for 17 targets , a mixture of contact binaries possibly offering reasonable orbital solutions with a selection of variables suspected to be contact binaries .",
    "the current paper is very similar in spirit : it gives radial velocity data and preliminary orbital solutions for 14 similar targets observed on 5 nights of november 28 to december 2 , 1996 , in the later part of the southern sky .",
    "the goals of this paper , similarly to those of paper  i , are close to the series of radial velocity studies currently conducted at the david dunlap observatory ( ddo )",
    ". this series has recently reached , with the eleventh paper @xcite ( where references to the previous papers and many common details can be found ) , the round number of 100 well covered rv orbits .",
    "the instrumentation and data analysis techniques , are explained in paper  i. the observations were carried with the eso la silla 1.52-m telescope and a b&ch cassegrain spectrograph .",
    "the broadening functions were extracted from the wavelength region of 401.6  499.8 nm .",
    "the spectra have a bf resolution of typically @xmath0 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "stellar exposure times ranged between 10 and 20 min , depending on brightness ; each stellar exposure was followed by a he - ar spectrum .",
    "spectrum extraction and wavelength calibration was carried out with eso midas software system . as a comparison star template",
    ", we used 68 eri ( f5 v ) , for which a radial velocity of @xmath2 was adopted  @xcite .    in terms of the presentation , we again stay close to the format of paper  i , the only difference being that the targets are discussed simply in the constellation order in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we see no obvious cases of pulsating stars in this group of the targets ; only cu  eri a and cu  eri  b do not appear to be close binaries .",
    "we describe our results in the context of existing photometric data from the literature and the hipparcos project .",
    "we also utilize the mean @xmath3 color indexes taken from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite and the photometric estimates of the spectral types using the relations published by @xcite .",
    "spectral types are taken uniformly from the 5 volumes of the michigan catalogue of hd stars @xcite ; hereafter quoted as hdh .",
    "because of the high incidence of companions to contact binary stars @xcite , we checked all stars for possible membership in visual systems using the washington double star catalog ( wds ) .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] present the broadening functions for all targets at phases selected for best visibility of both components .",
    "figures  [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the preliminary radial velocity orbital solutions .",
    "the rv data are given in table  [ tab1 ] , while parameters of the orbital solutions are listed in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "for most stars we used the primary eclipse predictions from the cracow on - line database @xcite .",
    "these predictions can be restored from the observed times of conjunctions ( @xmath4 ) and the observed _ minus _ predicted deviations @xmath5 , as given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "s ant ( hip  46810 , hd  82610 ) with @xmath6 is one the brightest contact binaries ( this and the following estimates of @xmath7 were obtained from the hipparcos magnitudes @xcite applying color dependent corrections @xmath8 ) . as its name implies , it is one of the first variable stars recognized as such in the southern hemisphere .",
    "s ant has been a frequent target of photometric observations , but the only previous spectroscopic observations were by @xcite who saw only one component with @xmath9 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath10 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , we could easily detect the secondary component in the broadening functions ( bfs ) , as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the center - of - mass velocity is very different from that observed previously , as are both semi - amplitudes @xmath11 ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "@xcite encountered some difficulties with producing a contact model for the binary suggesting possible problems with popper s spectroscopic data .",
    "they derived the mass ratio @xmath12 , which differs substantially from our @xmath13 .",
    "this is not surprising for a partially eclipsing system with a featureless light curve , for which a photometrically derived mass ratio is notoriously unreliable .",
    "we note that our bootstrap errors of @xmath11 are quite large , primarily due to the small number  rather than the low accuracy  of individual observations ; these uncertainty estimates are more realistic than the formal least - squares errors .",
    "the moment of the minimum as given in table  [ tab2 ] agrees perfectly well with the cracow ephemeride given in @xcite on the assumption that the trend indicated by the @xmath5 diagram has continued and reached @xmath14 day at the time of our observations .",
    "this value is uncertain and requires confirmation by photometric observations .",
    "judging by the light curve ( e.g.  from hipparcos ) , the current radial velocity data and the shapes of the bfs , s  ant is a very typical a - type contact binary .",
    "its spectral type is f3v ( hdh ) which agrees with @xmath15 from @xcite .",
    "its orbit almost certainly does not have any eccentricity , so its inclusion among early - type stars with potentially @xmath16 @xcite and the spectral type a6-f0iv - v are based on obsolete material .",
    "tt cet ( hip 8294 ) previously had not been observed spectroscopically , probably because of the relative faintness of the system at @xmath17 .",
    "the light curve suggests components of very different temperatures giving tt  cet a classification of eb .",
    "the star appears in the compilation of @xcite as a `` near - contact '' binary .",
    "indeed , the secondary is a faint and cool star because its signature is just barely present in our bfs ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , the sb2 orbit is relatively well defined although we have only the second half of the orbit properly covered by observations ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the binary appears to be a semi - detached or more likely a detached binary with a very faint secondary component .",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath18 .",
    "the spectral type is unknown . from @xmath19 derived from tycho-2 observations",
    ", one can estimate the spectral type of the primary star to be near f4v .",
    "tw cet ( hip 8447 ) is another relatively frequently photometrically observed binary with insufficient spectroscopic data . at @xmath20 and with a short period 0.32 days , it requires a moderately large telescope to avoid rv phase smearing .",
    "@xcite attempted to obtain radial velocities and obtained a preliminary orbit with @xmath21 km  s@xmath1 , @xmath22 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath23 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "they stressed that the two components appeared to be equal in strength .",
    "our bfs indeed show very similar components , but the orbital semi - amplitudes are different , resulting in a mass ratio @xmath24 .    with its mass ratio quite close to unity , @xmath25 ( tycho-2 ) implying a spectral type of about g1v , and very broad signatures of both components in the broadening functions ( figure  [ fig1 ] )",
    ", tw  cet appears to be a genuine , late - type contact binary .",
    "the binary is a component of the visual system wds  01489 - 2053 .",
    "the fainter companion ( @xmath26 ) slowly changed in angular separation from 8.3 arcsec in 1923 to 8.8 arcsec in 1998 .",
    "it was not included in the spectrograph slit .",
    "aa cet ( hip 9258 , hd 12180 ) is a relatively bright contact binary ( @xmath27 ) with unequally deep eclipses giving it a light curve classification of eb .",
    "it forms part of the visual binary wdc  01590 - 2255 and has a slightly fainter ( @xmath28 ) companion at a separation of 8.6 arcsec which was not included in the spectrograph slit .",
    "we obtained , however , one spectrum of the companion giving a radial velocity of @xmath29 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this is marginally consistent with the center of mass velocity of the binary , @xmath30 km  s@xmath1 .    the radial velocity orbit of aa  cet is well defined .",
    "the star appears to be a rather typical contact binary with a mass ratio of @xmath31 .",
    "the spectral type in hdh , a7/8v + g , might reflect the combined contribution of both visual components .",
    "however , @xmath32 ( tycho-2 ) corresponds to f3v rather than a7/8v , so that the spectral classification may have suffered from contamination by the visual companion .",
    "the color measurement @xmath33 @xcite also suggests f3v .",
    "@xcite gave the spectral type of the binary as f2 and noted that the companion , with a spectral type of f5 , shows sharp , double - lined spectra , indicating that itself it is a close binary system .",
    "our single spectrum of the companion does not show any doubling of the lines while the bf is very sharp as expected for a slowly rotating single star .",
    "rw dor ( hip 24763 , hd 269320 ) has been known as an variable since its discovery by leavitt in 1906 ; but it was @xcite who classified it as a w  uma system .",
    "it has been a subject of numerous photometric studies .",
    "the only spectroscopic radial velocity orbit is by @xcite who found @xmath34 km  s@xmath1 , @xmath35 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath36 km  s@xmath1 , thus implying @xmath37 .",
    "our orbit is different in that @xmath38 is by 25 km  s@xmath1 smaller and both semi - amplitudes @xmath11 are larger ; the mass ratio is , however , similar : @xmath39 .",
    "an under - estimation of the semi - amplitudes is a typical problem of insufficient resolution which may have been the result of the use of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) , in contrast to our much better resolving bf technique . on the other hand ,",
    "our phase coverage is very sparse , with only 3 observations not falling within the conjunctions .",
    "@xcite assumed a spectral type of k1v following @xcite .",
    "@xmath40 ( tycho-2 ) suggests an earlier spectral type of about g4/5v with @xmath41 .",
    "the binary is a contact system of the w - type , i.e.  the less massive , but brighter component is eclipsed at the primary eclipse .",
    "the contact binary ux eri ( hip 14699 ) was a subject of a recent ddo study ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ddo-3 ) to which the reader is referred to for more details .",
    "four of the current eso observations were used in that study in addition to 24 ddo observations .",
    "thus , the results of ddo-3 are certainly more reliable and should be used in the future . the current data are included here only for completeness .",
    "a separate orbital solution based on only these seven points ( table  [ tab2 ] ) gives smaller values of both @xmath11 , which can be a result of both a lower spectral resolution and of a much smaller number of observations .",
    "yy eri ( hip  19610 , hd  26609 ) is a bright ( @xmath42 ) contact system , a frequent subject of photometric investigations .",
    "a spectroscopic study was presented by @xcite , with small corrections by @xcite , giving the two semi - amplitudes , @xmath43 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath44 km  s@xmath1 and thus @xmath45 .",
    "a light curve synthesis solution was presented by @xcite where the mass ratio was kept at the spectroscopic value .",
    "later , @xcite presented orbital spectroscopic data with @xmath46 km  s@xmath1 , @xmath47 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath48 km  s@xmath1 ; with the proximity effects included , @xmath49 .",
    "our new orbit is well defined , agreeing moderately well with that of @xcite .",
    "our new value of @xmath50 does not include the proximity effects .",
    "the component of the larger mass shows better defined and stronger peaks in the bfs , but this component is in front during the primary ( deeper ) eclipse , so the binary is a w - type contact system .",
    "the spectral type of hdh is g3/k0+(f / g ) indicating a complex spectrum .",
    "we have no indications of the multiplicity of the system , neither from the bfs , nor from the visual star catalogs .",
    "@xmath51 suggests a spectral type about g3v .",
    "bv eri ( hip  18080 , hd  24327 ) is a well known , bright ( @xmath52 ) close binary with unequal surface brightness of the components giving it a light curve classification of eb .",
    "@xcite , following several investigations of similar systems by kauny ( e.g.   @xcite where previous analyses are cited ) considers the system to be a contact one , but with a very large difference in the brightness of both components .",
    "hdh gave a spectral type f2v , while the mean tycho-2 color , @xmath19 would suggest a slightly later type of f3/4v , or some small amount of reddening .",
    "the only previous radial velocity study is by @xcite who were able to see only one component giving @xmath53 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath54 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "we can see both components in our bfs and the orbital solution is relatively well defined .",
    "our mass ratio , @xmath55 , is different from gu s @xmath56 , which was given with an unrealistically small uncertainty of 0.001 .",
    "ct eri ( hip  20943 ) is a system very similar to bv  eri , except that it is fainter ( @xmath57 ) and has a fainter companion ( @xmath58 ) at a separation of 10 arcsec , forming the double system wds  04294 - 3335 . the spectral type is probably also similar : judging by the mean @xmath32 ( tycho-2 ) , the spectral type may be f2/3v .",
    "the simbad database quotes f0 .",
    "its variability was announced by @xcite .",
    "no light curve solutions nor radial velocity studied have been attempted so far .",
    "we see faint signatures of the secondary component of ct  eri in our bfs , although they are always difficult to measure .",
    "the formally derived mass ratio is practically identical to that of bv  eri , but its uncertainty is very large : @xmath59 , mostly because we could detect the faint secondary in only two observations .",
    "the bfs in the second half of the orbit were very difficult to interpret with asymmetries of the primary peak and an absence of the secondary peak .",
    "this visual binary has been included in our observations because it was listed in the list of @xcite as an eclipsing binary with a period of 0.63 days , but this was based on preliminary information only .",
    "@xcite noted its variability , but could not establish its type .",
    "cu  eri is part of the visual system wdc  02470 - 1320 with a separation of 3.7 arcsec and the visual magnitudes of @xmath60 and 13.5 .",
    "our bfs ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) indicate that spectral lines of the component b are slightly wider yielding @xmath61 km  s@xmath1 with possibly some asymmetry , while the component a shows a sharp , single peak typical for a slowly rotating star observed at our resolution .",
    "the spectral type of a in hdh is g8/k0iii .",
    "neither component appears to be a close binary .",
    "sz hor ( hip 14488 ) has not been much observed since its discovery @xcite probably because of its faintness , @xmath62 .",
    "judging by its tycho-2 color , @xmath63 , its spectral type is about f3v .",
    "our orbit is well defined and could be taken to indicate a typical contact binary of the a - type if not for the very different depths of the two eclipses giving it the light curve classification of eb .",
    "the mass ratio is @xmath64 .",
    "ad  phe ( hip 5955 ) has been recognized as a variable star for many years @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a good light curve and attempted to solve it making two doubtful ( and recognized as such ) assumptions of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , we find @xmath67 .",
    "similarly to yy  eri , the stronger and better defined component is the more massive one , but it is the one eclipsed at the slightly shallower minimum , so this is a w - type contact binary .",
    "no spectral type is available , but the mean @xmath68 suggests f9v or g0v .",
    "the star is moderately faint at @xmath69 .",
    "ty pup ( hip  36683 , hd  60265 ) is one of the brighter southern contact binaries ( @xmath70 ) and , as such , the subject of many photometric investigations .",
    "the star appears as a variable the first time in @xcite .",
    "the light curve suggests a contact binary possibly undergoing total eclipses .",
    "the only previous spectroscopic data have been obtained by @xcite who saw two periodicities ( both incorrect , 0.58 and 9.7 days ) and determined @xmath71 km  s@xmath1 and @xmath72 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "he classified the spectrum as a9n .",
    "the spectral classification of hdh is f3v , which agrees very well with the tycho-2 mean color index @xmath73 .",
    "the light curve synthesis modeling was attempted by @xcite who obtained @xmath74 , and by @xcite , who obtained a very different and unrealistically accurate @xmath75 .",
    "although we only have few observations , the mass ratio differs from both estimates , @xmath76 .",
    "the system is a very typical a - type contact binary without any obvious complications .",
    "hi pup ( hip 36762 ) is a relatively faint ( @xmath77 ) contact binary which has not had any photometric or radial velocity observations . discovered in 1949 , the system was classified and its light curve constructed from photographic observations by @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that it is a possible member of the open cluster cr  173 , but this matter has not been established yet .",
    "the tycho-2 mean @xmath78 corresponds to a spectral type about f6v , but there exist no direct classifications of the star .",
    "a companion with @xmath79 ( approximately m3v ) is located 52 arcsec away @xcite , but the star is not included as a visual double system in the wds catalog .",
    "we have only 5 radial velocity observations for hi  pup , so the radial velocity orbit must be considered very preliminary . the mass ratio is small , @xmath80 .",
    "tz pyx ( hip 42619 ) was discovered as a variable star by @xcite who determined the orbital period to be 0.697 days @xcite .",
    "later hipparcos observations @xcite showed that the binary has an orbital period of 2.3 days with a light curve showing relatively short , well defined eclipses .",
    "it is definitely a detached binary with well separated components , yet the star still appears as a w  uma - type binary in the simbad database with the spectral type as an uncertain a. the tycho-2 photometric data , @xmath81 , suggest a spectral type a8/9v at @xmath82 .",
    "our radial velocity orbit is the best among this group of targets , mostly because of sharp signatures in the broadening functions which were easy to measure for radial velocities .",
    "the mass ratio is very close to unity , @xmath83 , with the slightly less - massive component ( i.e.  the one showing the larger semi - amplitude ) giving a marginally stronger signature in the bf s .",
    "the current paper is the second and last of the two papers describing a short program of radial velocity observations of southern contact binary stars conducted at the european southern observatory in december 1996 and august 1998 .",
    "paper  i gave the full background and explanations for the rationale of this program , and contained results for 17 targets observable in the august season in 1998 .",
    "the current paper presents results for 14 binary stars and two suspected variable stars ( both components of the visual double cu  eri ) which were observed in 1996 . all the observed 14 binaries turned out to be double - lined ( sb2 ) permitting derivation of preliminary rv orbits for all of them .",
    "thus , three previously considered as sb1 systems , s  ant , bv  eri and ty  pup , have new , complete if sparsely covered rv orbits .",
    "our broadening function technique permitted to obtain improved rv orbits for the previously known sb2 systems tw  cet , rw  dor and yy  eri .",
    "we confirm that tz  pup is definitely not a contact binary star , but rather a detached system of almost identical a - type stars , in full agreement with the results of hipparcos which showed that the period is 2.3 days .",
    "we see very faint signatures of secondary components in some of our systems ( tt  cet , ct  eri , bv  eri , sz  hor ) , but in all cases we are confident that these are real detections .",
    "we could detect them because of the advantageous properties of the bf technique ; indeed , in most cases the secondaries are undetectable using the cross correlation function approach .",
    "the phase dependencies of the secondary star velocities are exactly as expected",
    ". however , these results will be testable in the future when data with higher spectral resolution and @xmath84 become available .",
    "four systems discussed in this paper and in paper  i have been investigated independently from eso and  at a later date  from ddo ( the ddo solution for ux  eri utilized a small number of eso observations so it was not fully independent ) . for these systems ,",
    "the mass - ratios @xmath85 derived from eso are on the average 6% larger ( with a range of 0% to 15% ) , and the @xmath38 center - of - mass velocities from eso by @xmath86 ( s.d . )",
    "more negative .",
    "it should be mentioned that the original goal of the current survey was to obtain reasonably accurate @xmath38 velocities for the determination of space motions , as well as first estimates of the system properties , within the allotted amount of observing time .    concerning the statistics of southern hemisphere contact binary stars : the two parts of the curent spectroscopic program resulted in observation of 23 contact binaries of which 12 are brighter than @xmath87 . taking into account that only about 1/2 of the southern sky was observed , we see that the numbers are small , much smaller than for the northern hemisphere .",
    "this dearth of data for the southern hemisphere was pointed by @xcite and is in a great need for rectification . within the strict limit of @xmath88 ,",
    "there are currently 20 southern contact systems with reliable radial velocity curves versus 58 similar northern systems .",
    "we note that the inequality between the hemispheres manifests itself not only in the lack of radial velocity data , but also in the number of detected contact binaries : to the same magnitude limit , we know 56 southern systems versus 72 northern systems , as based on the catalogue of @xcite ) . on the basis of the apparent relative frequency among fgk dwarfs of 0.2% , derived by @xcite and",
    "fully confirmed later @xcite , one can expect about 800 to 1000 contact binaries on the whole sky brighter than @xmath89 .",
    "most of them remain to be discovered , but most have small amplitudes @xcite , additionally diminished by the very frequent presence of companions @xcite .",
    "thus , the large photometric amplitude systems discussed in our two papers form a tip of an iceberg which still remains to be seen and explored .",
    "support from the natural sciences and engineering council of canada to smr is acknowledged with gratitude .",
    "the research made use of the simbad database , operated at the cds , strasbourg , france and accessible through the canadian astronomy data centre , which is operated by the herzberg institute of astrophysics , national research council of canada .",
