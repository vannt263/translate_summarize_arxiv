    "the pion - photon transition form factor @xmath5 , which relates two photons with one lightest meson , is the simplest example for the perturbative application to exclusive processes .",
    "it provides a good platform to study the property of pion distribution amplitude ( da ) , i.e. one can extract useful information on the shape of the leading - twist pion da by comparing the estimated result on the transition form factor @xmath6 with the measured one .",
    "the cello collaboration has measured the pion - photon transition form factor a long time ago , where , one of the photons is nearly on - shell and the other one is off - shell with a virtuality in the range of low energy region ( @xmath7 gev@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "later on , the cleo collaboration also measured such form factor but with a broader range of @xmath9 @xmath10 $ ]  gev@xmath8 @xcite . very recently , babar collaboration does a more precise measurement at both low and high energy region , and their data shows that in the range of @xmath11 $ ]   gev@xmath8 , the pion - photon transition form factor behaves as @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "such large @xmath2 behavior contradicts the well - known asymptotic prediction @xcite , i.e. @xmath15 tends to be a constant ( @xmath16 ) for asymptotic da @xmath17 , where the pion decay constant @xmath18  mev @xcite . by extending the previous next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections @xcite to the present large @xmath2 region , or even by including the next - to - next - to - leading order corrections @xcite , the significant growth of the pion - photon transition form factor between @xmath19 and @xmath20 gev@xmath8",
    "can not be explained by using the asymptotic or asymptotic - like da .",
    "therefore , many attempts have been tried to solve the present puzzle , some authors have been argued that in contrary to the conventional adopted asymptotic - like da , the pion da should be quite broad or even flat in its whole region @xcite . more explicitly , with a flat da @xmath21 , ref.@xcite shows that the present babar data at large @xmath2 can be explained by choosing proper values for the phenomenological parameters for the logarithmic model and the gaussian model constructed there .",
    "however , there is no strong reason to support such a flat da , since the introduced infrared regulator @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 ) is rightly fitted by the babar data .",
    "moreover , one may observe that ref.@xcite fails to explain the small @xmath2-behavior , and it can not reproduce the well - known value of @xmath24 that is derived from measuring the rate of @xmath25 @xcite . also it can be easily seen that the flat da with the wavefunction model suggested in ref.@xcite can not derive the right behavior at @xmath0 , since as will be shown later it will lead to the probability of finding the valence quark state in the pion , @xmath26 , and the charged mean squared radius , @xmath27 , both of which are divergent .",
    "furthermore , with such a flat da , the end - point singularity shall be emerged in many exclusive processes , such as @xmath28 light meson transition form factors , which makes them not calculable in perturbative qcd .",
    "this shall greatly compress the applicability of perturbative qcd .",
    "factorization approach , by keeping the transverse momentum dependence consistently and with the help of the sudakov and threshold resummation , this end - point singularity may be cured to a certain degree , e.g. for pion - photon transition form factor @xcite and for @xmath28 light form factors @xcite . ]    at present , there is no definite conclusion on whether pion da is in asymptotic form @xcite , in chernyak - zhitnitsky ( cz ) form @xcite or even in flat form @xcite .",
    "the pion da can be expressed in gegenbauer expansion @xcite .",
    "the value of the gegenbauer moments have been studied in various processes , cf .",
    "the lattice result of ref.@xcite prefers a narrower da with @xmath29 , while the lattice results @xcite prefer broader da , i.e. they obtain @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "these references favor a positive value for @xmath32 and the most recent one is done by ref.@xcite , which shows that @xmath33 through a qcd light - cone sum rule analysis of the semi - leptonic @xmath34 weak transition form factor based on the babar data on @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the pion - photon transition form factor being involved only one pion da maybe helpful to clarify the present situation .    as argued in ref.@xcite",
    ", the leading fock state contributes to @xmath36 only half and the remaining half should be come from the higher fock states as @xmath0 .",
    "and then both contributions from the leading fock state and the higher fock states are needed to get the correct @xmath25 rate . in ref.@xcite , we have made such a comprehensive analysis of the pion - photon transition form factor in a smaller @xmath2 region , e.g. @xmath37 $ ] gev@xmath8 , by taking both the valence quark and the non - valence quark contributions into consideration .",
    "it has been found that both the asymptotic - like and the cz - like das can explain the cello and cleo data @xcite by setting proper parameters for the pion wavefunction .",
    "then it shall be interesting to extend our previous analysis to higher @xmath2 region so as to determine which pionic behavior is more preferable for consistently explaining the cello , cleo and babar data within the whole measured energy region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we present the calculation technology to derive the valence and non - valence contributions to the pion - photon transition form factor . for such purpose , we construct a pion wavefunction model based on the bhl - prescription and present all the necessary formulae for discussion its properties . in sec.iii , we discuss what we can learn of the pionic leading fock - state wavefunction / da in comparison with cello , cleo and babar experimental data .",
    "some further discussion and comments are made in sec.iv .",
    ", where @xmath38 . the rightmost shaded oval with a slant pattern stands for the strong interactions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    generally , the pion - photon transition form factor @xmath5",
    "can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the usual valence quark part , @xmath41 stands for the non - valence quark part that is related to the higher fock state of pion .",
    "the valence quark contribution @xmath40 dominates only as @xmath2 becomes very large .",
    "fig.([feyn ] ) shows this point more clearly .",
    "@xmath42 comes from fig.([feyn]a ) , which involves the direct annihilation of @xmath43-pair into two photons , i.e. the leading fock - state contribution that dominates the large @xmath2 contribution .",

    "while for the non - valence part @xmath41 , because of its non - perturbative nature , we shall construct a phenomenological model based on limiting behavior at @xmath0 and @xmath1 to estimate it s contribution .",

    ", it is found that @xmath57 usually is quite larger than @xmath58 , which is consistent with our model wavefunction ( [ wave1 ] ) , where only the first two gegenbauer terms are kept in @xmath59 .",
    "it is noted that by varying the parameter @xmath3 within the region of @xmath60 $ ] , the pion da shall vary from aymptotic - like to cz - like form . to show this point more clearly",
    ", we draw the pion da defined in eq.([phimodel ] ) in fig.([phi ] ) , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath4 respectively . as a comparison",
    ", we also present the conventional asymptotic - form da , @xmath61 @xcite , and the cz - form da , @xmath62 @xcite .",

    "these values are somewhat smaller than the measured pion charged radius @xmath66  @xcite and @xmath67  @xcite , but it is close to the value as suggested in refs.@xcite .",
    "such smaller @xmath63 for the leading fock - state wavefunction is reasonable , since the probability of leading fock state @xmath52 is less than @xmath68 and is about @xmath69 .",
    "this confirms the necessity of taking the higher fock - states into consideration to give full estimation of the pion electromagnetic form factor / pion - photon transition form factor , especially for lower @xmath2 regions .",
    "a naive pion wavefunction model has been suggested in ref.@xcite to explain the new babar data @xcite , which is constructed with a flat da together with a gaussian ansatz for the @xmath70-dependence , i.e. @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "with such a model ( by setting @xmath74 ) , it can be easily see that one can not derive the right behavior at @xmath0 @xcite , since following the similar steps as shown in sec.ii.d , it will lead to @xmath75 and @xmath76 , both of which are divergent .",
    "this in some sense explains why such model wavefunction can explain the pion - photon transition form factor s large @xmath2 behavior ( due to the large enhancement at the end - point region ) , but fails to explain the lower @xmath2 behavior .    ) with the brodsky and teramond s holographic model ( bt model ) , where @xmath46 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively . , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    next , it would be interesting to make a comparison with brodsky and teramond s holographic model ( bt model ) with a quark mass effect @xcite for the pion da .",
    "the bt model is predicted by using the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence and by using the soft - wall holographic model , whose explicit form is @xcite @xmath80 \\left[1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu_0 ^ 2}{2\\kappa^2 x(1-x)}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath81 gev @xcite , @xmath82 mev and @xmath83 mev @xcite .",
