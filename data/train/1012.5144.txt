    "while the evolution of the dark matter is reasonably well understood , the evolution of the baryonic component is much less certain because of the complexity of the relevant physical processes , such as star formation and feedback . with the",
    "commonly employed , schematic star formation criteria alone , the predicted star formation rates ( sfrs ) are higher than what is compatible with the observed luminosity density . thus feedback mechanisms are in general invoked to reheat gas and suppress star formation .",
    "we include the feedback from stellar winds , core - collapse supernovae ( normal type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) and hypernovae ( hne ) ) , and type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in our hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "supernovae inject not only thermal energy but also heavy elements into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , which can enhance star formation .",
    "chemical enrichment must be solved as well as energy feedback .",
    "supernova feedback is also important for solving the angular momentum problem @xcite and the missing satellite problem @xcite , and for explaining the existence of heavy elements in intracluster medium @xcite and intergalactic medium , and possibly the mass - metallicity relation of galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k07 ) .",
    "since different heavy elements are produced from different supernovae with different timescales , elemental abundance ratios can provide independent information on `` age '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kn09 ) .",
    "therefore , stars in a galaxy can be used as fossils where the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy is imprinted , and this approach is called as galactic archeology . in the milky way galaxy ,",
    "the detailed structures of kinematics and metallicities have been obtained with sdss ( the sloan digital sky survey ) and rave ( the radial velocity experiment ) , and will be extended with pan - starrs and skymapper . in the next decade , high - resolution multi - object spectroscopy ( e.g. , apogee with sdss and hermes on the aat ) and space astrometry mission ( e.g. , gaia ) will provide 6d - kinematics and elemental abundances for a million stars in the local group . in order to untangle the formation and evolution history of the galaxy from observational data , a `` realistic '' model that includes star formation and chemical enrichment is required .",
    "although there are several simulations of the milky way - type galaxy with very high resolutions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there are few studies with hydrodynamics and chemical enrichment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most of the previous work ,",
    "however , the adopted assumptions are not appropriate for comparison with observations ; the effect of mass - loss from stars is ignored , the timescales of sne ia is given by only one parameter , the nucleosynthesis yields of supernovae are outdated , and so on .",
    "recently , several new findings have been obtained from the collaboration between observations , stellar astrophysics , and galactic chemical evolution modeling . from the observed light curves and spectra of nearby core - collapse supernovae",
    ", it has been shown that there are energetic supernovae , hne , ejecting more than ten times larger explosion energy ( @xmath3 ) and a certain amount of iron ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the gravity is computed with the tree method using the special purpose computer grape ( gravity pipe ) system at the national astronomical observatory of japan . for hydrodynamics , the smoothed particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) method",
    "is adopted , and the sph formulation is the almost same as @xcite .",
    "the grape - sph code is highly adaptive in space and time by means of individual smoothing lengths and individual timesteps , and it has very high performance ( a week for one simulation with @xmath7 ) .",

    "our * star formation * criteria are the same as @xcite ; 1 ) convergent , 2 ) cooling , and 3 ) jeans unstable .",
    "the sfr is determined from the schmidt law ; the star formation timescale is proportional to the dynamical timescale ( @xmath8 ) , where @xmath9 is chosen from the size - luminosity relation of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that @xmath9 gives a better fit to the elemental abundance ratios in the milky way galaxy than @xmath10 ( see fig . [ fig : afenum05 ] ) .",

    "the sfr depends both on the local density and metallicity , which is different from other simplified models such as one - zone models .",
    "4 .   if a gas particle satisfies the star formation criteria , a part of the mass of the gas particle turns into a star particle .",
    "since one star particle has the mass of @xmath11 , the star particle is not a single star but an association of many stars .",

    "the mass transfer is weighted by the sph kernel from the gas particle to the dying star particle .",
    "this feedback scheme is better than that implementing a fixed number of feedback neighbor particles ( @xmath15 ) in galaxy - scale simulations ; the metallicity of gas particles does not depend very much on the local density if @xmath15 is fixed .",

    "the photometric evolution of the galaxy is calculated from the summation of the ssp spectra of star particles with various ages and metallicities .      the scheme to include the detailed chemical enrichment into sph simulations has been proposed by @xcite and updated as follows .",
    "* hypernovae ( hne ) *  the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae is still uncertain , although a few groups have presented feasible calculations in exploding core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",

    "for the evolution of accreting c+o wds toward the ch mass , two scenarios have been proposed ; one is the double - degenerate scenario , i.e. , the merging of double c+o wds with a combined mass surpassing the ch mass limit .",
    "however , it has been theoretically suggested that it leads to accretion - induced collapse rather than sne ia @xcite , and the lifetimes are too short to reproduce the chemical evolution in the solar neighborhood ( kn09 ) .",
    "the other is the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario , i.e. , the wd mass grows by accretion of hydrogen - rich matter via mass transfer from a binary companion .",
    "the mass accretion rate is very limited to trigger carbon deflagration @xcite , but the allowed parameter space of binary systems can be significantly increased by the wd wind effect if the metallicity is higher than [ fe / h ] @xmath35 ( k98 ) .",
    "two progenitor systems are found for red - giant ( rg ) companions with initial masses of @xmath36 and near main - sequence ( ms ) companions with initial masses of @xmath37 @xcite .    in our simulations , based on the sd scenario ,",
    "the lifetime distribution function of sne ia is calculated with eq.[2 ] in kn09 , taking into account the metallicity dependence of the wd winds ( k98 ) and the mass - stripping effect on the binary companion stars ( kn09 ) .",

    "the other is for the rg+wd systems with @xmath39 gyr timescales , which are dominant in early - type galaxies .",
    "although the metallicity effect has not been confirmed from the supernova survey yet , it is more strongly required in the presence of the young population of sne ia , to be consistent with the chemical evolution of the milky way galaxy .",
    "the absolute rates of each component depend on two binary parameters , which are determined by the requirement to meet the observed metallicity distribution function and [ @xmath1/fe]-[fe / h ] relations in the solar neighborhood , and the observed supernova rates in various types of galaxies .",
