    "neutron stars ( nss ) are among the most mysterious objects in the universe . with a typical mass of about @xmath1 but a radius of only about 12 km ,",
    "the average density in nss is several times that in atomic nuclei .",
    "their extreme compactness makes them a natural laboratory to test our knowledge about general relativity and properties of dense neutron - rich nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "moreover , their generally large angular momentum and possible quadrupole deformation make them strong candidates among many possible sources to emit gravitational waves ( gws )  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the estimated central density of some nss may be higher than the predicted hadron - quark phase transition density , and thus there might be a quark core in these so - called hybrid stars , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review .",
    "moreover , some originally hadronic nss with central densities below but close to the hadron - quark transition density might increase their central densities due to , for example , their spin - downs  @xcite or the accretion of masses from their binary companions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the hadron - quark phase transition may occur in their cores , turning them into hybrid nss as they evolve .",
    "consequently , a micro - collapse is expected to occur as a result of the softer equation of state ( eos ) of quark matter than that of hadronic matter .",
    "because of the difference in the binding energies for the pure hyperonic and hybrid configurations of nss , some energy will be released from the ns after the hadron - quark phase transition . to understand the mechanism of the hadron - quark phase transition and the associated energy release , their dependence on properties of the dense hadronic and quark matter , the way the energy release being dissipated in nss or carried away by gravitational waves , and the gravitational wave signatures of the eos of dense matter and the expected hadron - quark phase transition are among the many interesting questions currently under intense investigations in neutron star physics and gravitational wave astronomy , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    in a recent work involving some of us  @xcite , several model eoss for hybrid stars were obtained from an isospin- and momentum - dependent effective interaction ( mdi )  @xcite for the baryon octet , the mit bag model for the quark matter  @xcite and the gibbs construction for the hadron - quark phase transition  @xcite . since there have been many other studies using similar approaches in the literature",
    ", it is especially worth mentioning that while the isospin - symmetric part of the hadronic eoss used in this work is constrained by the experimental data on collective flow and kaon production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , the symmetry energy term at sub - saturation densities is constrained in a narrow range by the experimental data on isospin diffusion in heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies  @xcite .",
    "the obtained eoss with various bag constants were then used in studying the main features of the hadron - quark phase transitions and the resulting mass - radius correlations of hybrid stars . with this paper as a continuation of our recent work in refs .",
    "@xcite , we make new contributions to the fast growing field of nuclear astrophysics in two ways .",
    "first of all , critical for understanding the physics of the hadron - quark phase transition are the eoss of both the hadronic and quark matter . despite of the great efforts made by both the astrophysics and the nuclear physics community , our current knowledge about the eos of dense matter either in the hadronic or quark phase is still very poor .",
    "more specifically , for the neutron - rich hadronic matter the most uncertain part of the eos is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy which encodes the energy associated with the neutron - proton asymmetry  @xcite . for the quark matter within the mit bag model ,",
    "the most uncertain part of its eos is the bag constant which measures the inward pressure on the surface of the bag to balances the outward pressure originating from the fermi motion and interactions of quarks confined in the bag .",
    "it is thus of interest and also necessary to examine the relative effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and the bag constant on the total energy release due to the hadron - quark phase transition in nss .",
    "secondly , a part of the energy release may be carried away by gws .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the latter can then be obtained by assuming that all the released energy is available for gws . besides testing a fundamental prediction of general relativity ,",
    "gravitational waves hold the great promises to open up a completely new non - electromagnetic window into the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "if detected in the future , the gws may also help probe properties of dense neutron - rich nuclear matter in nss .",
    "thus , it is important to examine the imprints of the nuclear symmetry energy and the bag constant on the frequency and damping time of gws . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the first axial @xmath0-mode of gws due to the disturbance of the space - time curvature  @xcite .",
    "we find that the energy release obtained using the gibbs construction for the quark - hadron phase transition is much more sensitive to the bag constant than the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "furthermore , the frequency of the @xmath0-mode is found to be significantly different with or without the hadron - quark phase transition and depends strongly on the value of the bag constant @xmath2 for a given density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "however , when a larger bag constant is used such that the hadron - quark phase transition happens at a higher baryon density , effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy also become very important .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize the mdi interaction , the mit bag model , and the resulting model eoss for hybrid stars obtained using the gibbs construction . in section iii , the total energy release from hadron - quark phase transition in nss and its dependence on the symmetry energy and the bag constant are presented . in section iv ,",
    "the frequency and damping time of the axial @xmath0-mode of gws and their dependence on the symmetry energy and the bag constant are studied .",
    "finally , a summary is given in section v.",
    "since we are mostly interested in examining the relative effects of the nuclear symmetry energy and the bag constant on the total energy release during the hadron - quark phase transition in neutron stars as well as the frequency and damping time of the @xmath0-mode of emitted gws , we first illustrate their effects on the eos of hybrid stars by using the model introduced in ref .  @xcite . for completeness and to facilitate the discussions , we briefly summarize the eoss for hybrid stars obtained in ref .",

    "their potentials are fixed at @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 is used to model the isospin dependence of the interaction between two baryons .",
    "its value can be adjusted to mimic different density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy and is taken to be @xmath16 or @xmath3 in the present study . shown in fig .",
    "[ esym ] is the corresponding density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath30 .",
    "it is worth noting that the latest experimental constraints on @xmath30 at sub - saturation densities are consistent with but span a region larger than the one covered by the @xmath31 and @xmath32 curves @xcite .",
    "the experimental constraints on @xmath30 at supra - saturation densities are , on the other hand , still very uncertain .",
    "in fact , the high density behavior of @xmath33 is considered the most uncertain part of the eos of dense neutron - rich nuclear matter @xcite .",

    "@xcite . as in previous studies , see , e.g. , refs.@xcite , the hybrid star is divided into three parts from the center to the surface : the liquid core , the inner crust , and the outer crust .",
    "it is in the liquid core where the matter can be pure hadrons , quarks or a mixture of the two . in the inner crust ,",
    "a parameterized eos of @xmath36 is used as in refs .",
    "the outer crust usually consists of heavy nuclei and the electron gas , where the bps eos  @xcite is used .",

    "for comparisons , the pure @xmath42 ( labeled as nucleonic ) and hyperonic ( labeled as mdi hyp - r interaction ) eoss are also included . as it is well known , the appearance of hyperons and the hadron - quark phase transition softens the eos of neutron star matter . also , it is worth noting that the adiabatic coefficient @xmath43 at saturation density is 2.63 and 2.57 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the eoss with @xmath31 and @xmath32 are thus about the same below and around the saturation density .",
    "however , it is interesting to see that the starting point and the degree of softening due to the appearance of hyperons are sensitive to @xmath30 at high densities .",
    "moreover , the @xmath33 also affects appreciably the starting point of the hadron - quark mixed phase especially with the larger bag constant . nevertheless , it is obvious that the starting point is much more sensitive to the bag constant @xmath2 for a given symmetry energy parameter @xmath29 .",
    "these features are consistent with those first noticed by kutschera et al .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that since the mixed phase is described using the gibbs instead of the maxwell construction , the energy density thus increases continuously with pressure across the mixed phase without a jump @xcite .",
    "consequently , the sidov criterium that a stable hybrid star must satisfy @xcite , i.e. , @xmath44 with p , @xmath45 and @xmath46 denoting , respectively , the pressure , the energy density of quarks and hadrons at the transition point , is automatically satisfied .",
    "the amount of energy release during the micro - collapse of a neutron star triggered by the hadron - quark phase transition is given by the change in its binding energy before and after the phase transition .",
    "the binding energy of a neutron star can be obtained from first solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation with the corresponding eos ( @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the pressure and the energy density at radius @xmath51 .",

    ".the baryon number ( @xmath7 ) , gravitational masses of hyperonic stars ( @xmath62 ) , hybrid stars ( @xmath63 ) , the quark core including the mixed phase ( @xmath64 ) , the radii of hyperonic ( @xmath65 ) and hybrid stars ( @xmath66 as well as the energy release ( @xmath60 ) with @xmath31 and @xmath67 .",

    "it is seen that the energy release increases with @xmath69 and is higher with the smaller ( @xmath71 mev ) bag constant @xmath2 but stiffer ( @xmath32 ) symmetry energy .",
    "effects of varying the bag constant @xmath2 are obviously more significant than varying the symmetry energy parameter @xmath29 , especially on the core mass and thus the energy release .",
    "the variation of the bag constant @xmath2 also affects appreciably the radii of hybrid stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of the symmetry energy parameter @xmath29 only has appreciable effects on the radii of both hyperonic and hybrid stars .",
    "it s effects on the energy release is much smaller than the bag constant @xmath2 .",
    "it is worth noting that it was first shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the binding energies of nss consisting of pure @xmath42 matter depend strongly on the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "it is easily understandable that the difference in binding energies before and after the hadron - quark phase transition becomes less sensitive to the symmetry energy .",
    "some of these features can be better understood from inspecting the gravitational mass - radius and mass - central density correlations with and without the hadron - quark phase transition using different bag constants and symmetry energy functionals .",

    "the hyperonic eos is stiffer with a stiffer symmetry energy , leading to a larger radius and thus a lower central density and a smaller maximum mass .",
    "the mass difference before and after the hadron - quark phase transition is therefore also larger .",

    "they are also useful for explaining why we study in detail in the next section the frequency and damping time of the @xmath0-mode of gws .",
    "generally , the magnitude of gws is denoted by the gravitational strain amplitude in the following wave form : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the initial amplitude , @xmath76 is the angular frequency and @xmath77 is the damping timescale . assuming all energy release @xmath60 is available to gw emission , the maximum value of the initial amplitude is then @xcite @xmath78^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the distance of the source from the detector .",
    "thus , the maximum strain amplitude is directly determined by the energy release . however , not all the energy release is available for emitting gravitational waves  @xcite as the energy can be dissipated by other mechanisms .",
    "in fact , most of the energy release from the hadron - quark phase transition would be used to excite radial oscillations @xcite . moreover",
    ", the pure radial models do not generate any gravitational waves unless they are coupled with rotation @xcite .",
    "however , because of angular momentum conservation , rotating neutron stars are more likely to be formed during supernova explosions . if there are some other dissipating mechanisms of timescale @xmath80 during the hadron - quark phase transition in neutron stars , the fraction of energy dissipated by gravitational waves is then approximately @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "thus , the relative damping timescale of the gws with respect to that due to other mechanisms determines the fraction of the total energy release that can be carried away by gws . in the literature ,",
    "time scales of various gw modes and various energy dissipation mechanisms have been considered , see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein . as for many other interesting questions in the field , the conclusions so far are still very model dependent .",
    "gws from non - radial oscillations of nss carry important information about their internal structures  @xcite .",
    "one special type of normal modes of oscillations that only exists in general relativity is the so called @xmath0-mode associated with the perturbation of the space - time curvature and for which the motion of the fluid is negligible @xcite . while the frequencies of the @xmath0-mode is significantly above the operating frequencies of existing gw detectors , it is nevertheless useful to further investigate what information about the internal structure of nss may be revealed from a future detection of the @xmath0-mode of gws .    according to chandrasekhar & ferrari @xcite , the axial perturbation equations for a static neutron star can be simplified by introducing a function @xmath82 that is constructed from the radial part of the perturbed axial metric components .",

    "it was found that the density dependence of the symmetry energy has strong imprints on both the frequency and damping time of the axial @xmath0-mode . in this section ,",
    "we examine how the appearance of hyperons and the hadron - quark phase transition may affect the frequency and damping time of the axial @xmath0-mode .",

    "<S> describing the hyperonic and quark phases of neutron stars with an isospin- and momentum - dependent effective interaction for the baryon octet and the mit bag model , respectively , and using the gibbs conditions to construct the mixed phase , we study the energy release due to the hadron - quark phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the frequency and damping time of the first axial @xmath0-mode of gravitational waves are studied for both hyperonic and hybrid stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the energy release is much more sensitive to the bag constant than the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy . </S>",
    "<S> also , the frequency of the @xmath0-mode is found to be significantly different with or without the hadron - quark phase transition and depends strongly on the value of the bag constant . </S>",
    "<S> effects of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy become , however , important for large values of the bag constant that lead to higher hadron - quark transition densities . </S>"
