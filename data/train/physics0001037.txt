    "more generally , a sensitivity advantage may be expected in any model that seeks to explain mass generation  @xcite .",
    "beam - beam interactions make high luminosity harder to achieve as the energy of an @xmath4 linear collider is increased , an effect that is negligible for muon colliders  @xcite .",

    "@xcite is a comprehensive summary of the status of muon collider research as of @xmath81 year ago .",
    "while stored muon beams have been discussed since @xmath81960  @xcite , and muon colliders since 1968  @xcite , only in recent years has a practical approach to the realization of a @xmath0 collider been devised .",
    "the key concept that may allow a muon collider to become a reality is ionization cooling  @xcite .",
    "muons may be copiously produced using collisions of multi - gev protons with a target to produce pions , which then decay in a focusing  capture channel .",
    "\" however , those muons occupy a large emittance ( phase - space volume ) and are unsuitable for injection directly into an accelerator .",
    "muon - beam cooling is needed to reduce the emittance by a sufficient factor but must be carried out in a time short compared to the @xmath9s muon lifetime . while other beam - cooling methods are too slow , as discussed below , simulations show that ionization cooling can meet these requirements .",
    "muon - collider luminosity estimates ( see table  [ tab : params ] ) have been made under the assumption that a 4mw proton beam may safely strike a target representing 23 hadronic interaction lengths , which is tilted at a 100150mr angle with respect to the solenoidal focusing field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : targetry ] ) .",
    "design studies are ongoing to demonstrate this in detail , and bnl - e951 at the ags will test this experimentally within the next few years  @xcite .",
    "ideas being explored include a liquid - metal jet target ( fig .",
    "[ fig : targetry ] ) and a  bandsaw \" target ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bandsaw ] ) . in neutrino - factory scenarios",
    "the beam power requirement is eased to 1mw , making a graphite target also a possibility . about 10% of the beam energy",
    "is dissipated in the target . a target with comparable dissipation",
    "is being designed for the spallation neutron source at oak ridge national laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the required 4mw proton source , while beyond existing capability , is the subject of ongoing design studies at brookhaven  @xcite and fermilab  @xcite and is comparable in many respects to machines proposed for spallation neutron sources  @xcite . for efficient capture of the produced low - energy pions ,",
    "the target is located within a 20 t solenoidal magnetic field to be produced using a superconducting solenoid with a water - cooled copper - coil insert ( fig .",
    "[ fig : targetry ] ) .",
    "the captured pions and their decay muons proceed through a solenoidal field that decreases adiabatically to 1.25 t .",
    "simulations show that @xmath80.6 pions / proton are captured in such a channel for proton energy in the range 1624gev .",
    "=    the resulting muon bunches , while very intense , feature a large energy spread , which must be decreased for acceptance into a cooling channel .",
    "this can be accomplished via radio - frequency ( rf )  phase rotation , \" by which the energy of the low - energy muons is raised and that of the high - energy muons lowered .",
    "this brings a substantial fraction ( @xmath860% ) of the muons into a narrow energy range at the expense of increasing the bunch length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evst ] ) .",
    "the large transverse size of the beam at this point necessitates low - frequency ( 3060mhz ) rf cavities .",
    "an alternative under investigation is use of an induction linac .",
    "if the phase - rotation accelerating gradient is sufficiently high ( @xmath845mv / m ) , a significant portion of the pions can be phase - rotated before they decay , allowing muon polarization as high as @xmath850% .",
    "otherwise the polarization is naturally @xmath820%  @xcite .",
    "muon polarization can be exploited in a variety of physics studies  @xcite as well as in a neutrino factory  @xcite .",
    "it can also provide a @xmath10 fill - to - fill relative calibration of the beam energy  @xcite ( needed e.g.  to measure the width of the higgs ) .",
    "the goal of beam cooling is to reduce the normalized six - dimensional emittance of the beam .",
    "the significance of emittance for accelerator design is that it places limits on how tightly the beam can be focused and determines the apertures necessary to transport and accelerate it without losses .",
    "a muon beam can be cooled by passing it alternately through material , in which ionization energy loss reduces both the transverse and longitudinal momentum components , and rf accelerating cavities , in which the lost longitudinal momentum is restored ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this process reduces the transverse momentum components relative to the longitudinal one (  transverse cooling \" ) .    before summarizing the theory of ionization cooling we",
    "must first define emittance more carefully .",
    "emittance can be defined in terms of the vector of canonical variables describing each muon , which can be chosen as @xmath11 . in the absence of correlations among these variables , the six - dimensional volume of the beam in phase space",
    "can be represented by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 designates the r.m.s .",
    "width of the distribution in the @xmath14th variable . more generally , the normalized six - dimensional emittance @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath18 covariance matrix of @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the mass of of the muon , and @xmath21 is the speed of light .",
    "if the off - diagonal ( correlation ) terms of @xmath17 are negligible , the emittance can be approximated as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and so forth , or in a cylindrically - symmetric system such as we consider below , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the normalized transverse ( longitudinal ) emittance .    by liouville",
    "s theorem , normalized emittance is conserved in linear beam transport and acceleration .",
    "beam cooling thus requires a  violation \" of liouville s theorem , which is possible by means of dissipative forces such as ionization energy loss  @xcite .",
    "ionization cooling is approximately described by the following equation  @xcite : @xmath27 where @xmath2 is the path length , @xmath28 the muon energy , @xmath29 the radiation length of the absorber medium , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the betatron function of the beam ( inversely proportional to the square of the beam divergence ) .    in eq .",
    "[ eq : cool ] we see , in addition to the @xmath32 transverse cooling term , a transverse heating term due to multiple coulomb scattering of the muons in the absorber .",
    "since cooling ceases once the heating and cooling terms are equal , eq .  [ eq : cool ] implies an equilibrium emittance , which in principle ( neglecting other limiting efects ) would be reached asymptotically were the cooling channel continued indefinitely . since the heating term is proportional to @xmath31 and inversely proportional to the radiation length of the absorber medium , the goal of achieving as small an equilibrium emittance as possible requires us to locate the absorber only in low-@xmath31 regions and to use a medium with the longest possible radiation length , namely hydrogen . to achieve low @xmath31",
    ", we want the strongest possible focusing elements .",
    "we are thus led to superconducting solenoids filled with liquid hydrogen as possibly the optimal solution .    below the ionization minimum",
    ", energy loss increases approximately as @xmath33 , while coulomb scattering increases only as @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "ionization cooling thus favors low momenta , despite the relativistic increase in muon lifetime with momentum .",
    "in fact , eq .  [ eq : cool ] implies that the equilibrium emittance scales approximately as @xmath35 .",
    "most simulations of muon cooling are now being done at @xmath36mev/@xmath21 .",
    "still lower momenta could in principle be better but are difficult to transport in practice due to larger beam divergences .      in the  alternating - solenoid \" cooling channel  @xcite the muon beam",
    "is kept focused by a series of superconducting solenoids alternating in magnetic - field direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : soso ] ) .",
    "as the field alternates , its magnitude must of course pass through zero ; at these points @xmath31 is necessarily large . here",
    "solenoids with large inner bore are suitable , allowing insertion of rf cavities . in between are regions of low @xmath31 , corresponding to maxima of the magnetic field , where the liquid - hydrogen absorbers are located .",
    "( the field directions alternate so that canonical angular momentum  @xcite , which builds up within each absorber as the muon beam loses mechanical angular momentum , cancels rather than building up . )",
    "another type of arrangement ( dubbed  fofo \" ) is also under study , in which solenoid fringe - field focusing is employed .",
    "this allows lower @xmath31 values for a given field strength than in the alternating - solenoid arrangement . in the fofo channel the low-@xmath31 regions ( and the absorbers )",
    "are thus at low field and the rf cavities at high field .",
    "both the fofo and alternating - solenoid cooling channels feature liquid - hydrogen absorbers in which a substantial amount of power is dissipated by the muon beam . in a typical case , @xmath37 muons per bunch at a 15hz repetition rate deposit a few hundred watts in each absorber .",
    "this is within the range of operation of high - power liquid - hydrogen targets that have been used in the past  @xcite or proposed for future experiments  @xcite .",
    "careful attention must be paid to the design of these absorbers , for reasons both of safety and of performance .",
    "for example , the windows must be made of low-@xmath38 material and kept as thin as possible in order not to degrade the cooling performance by causing excessive multiple scattering .",
    "aluminum alloy appears to be an acceptable solution .    as an example of the performance that can be achieved in such a cooling channel , fig .",
    "[ fig : sososim ] shows as a function of distance the six - dimensional and longitudinal beam emittances as well as the relative beam intensity in a simulated alternating - solenoid channel using @xmath815 t solenoids and 805mhz rf cavities .",
    "these cooling - channel parameters are representative of a late stage of cooling for a muon collider and were chosen for initial detailed studies in order to demonstrate a solution in a technically - challenging regime .",
    "the six - dimensional emittance is reduced by a factor of 3 in 26 m , with less than 2% non - decay beam loss .",
    "=    eq .  [ eq : cool ] implies a natural scaling of the cooling - channel components as the beam becomes progressively cooler : to maintain the cooling rate as equilibrium is approached , @xmath31 must be periodically decreased to establish a new , smaller , equilibrium emittance .",
    "this means the focusing fields must become stronger .",
    "how small a @xmath31 can be achieved in an alternating - solenoid channel has not yet been definitively determined , but 20 t seems a practical upper limit to superconducting - solenoid field strength  @xcite , and perhaps 30 t in a superconducting / copper hybrid design . to continue transverse cooling beyond the practical limit for the alternating - solenoid channel , liquid - lithium lenses or fofo - type channels may be solutions . in a scenario sketched by palmer",
    "@xcite a factor @xmath39 in six - dimensional emittance is achieved in a distance of @xmath8500 m using a series of 25 alternating - solenoid channels followed by three lithium - lens stages , with each stage contributing a factor of about 2 .",
    "this cooling factor is sufficient to permit the collider luminosities of table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "as the muon beam passes through the transverse - cooling channel the longitudinal emittance grows .",
    "this arises from four effects :    1 .",
    "working below the ionization minimum , there is positive feedback , since as the muons lose momentum their energy - loss rate increases .",
    "the beam energy spread increases in the absorber due to energy - loss straggling .",
    "3 .   the bunch tends to drift apart because slow muons take longer to traverse the channnel than fast muons .",
    "4 .   the bunch tends to drift apart because muons at large transverse amplitude follow helical trajectories of greater path length than muons at small transverse amplitude .",
    "eventually , significant beam losses begin to occur ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sososim ] ) as muons drift outside the stable rf bucket . at this point",
    "longitudinal emittance must be exchanged for transverse emittance .",
    "such emittance exchange may be accomplished by placing wedge - shaped absorbers at a point of momentum dispersion in the beam transport lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exchange ] ) . with high - momentum muons passing through a greater thickness of absorber than low - energy muons ,",
    "the beam energy spread is reduced , at the expense of an increase in transverse beam size . while solutions have been devised on paper , detailed simulations so far",
    "have shown that a concrete realization of this idea is challenging , and work is ongoing to find a practical solution .",
    "rapid muon cooling requires development of high - gradient rf cavities ( e.g. , 36mv / m at 805mhz ) with suitable high - power drive systems",
    ". a novel feature of muon acceleration is the possibility of using  pillbox \" cavities , closed at each end by low - mass metal windows , to increase the uniformity of the electric field within the cavity and lower the power requirements .",
    "these developments are in progress , with 805mhz  @xcite and 175200mhz designs now under development and planned for testing over the next few years at bnl , fnal , and lbnl .",
    "alternative gridded and windowless designs are also in progress , as well as power - source design studies .",
    "while the physics underlying ionization cooling is reasonably well understood , ionization cooling has yet to be demonstrated in practice . to demonstrate feasibility and establish performance , a muon cooling experiment ( mucool )",
    "@xcite has been proposed to fermilab ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mucool ] ) . with the increasing interest in the possibility of a muon - storage - ring neutrino factory , over the last year",
    "the activities of the nfmcc have undergone a change of emphasis , and the focus of the proposed experiment is now turning from the late stages of cooling to the initial stages .",
    "we now envisage a cooling test facility that will be staged so as to demonstrate initial - stage cooling ( such as will be needed for a neutrino factory ) first , with tests of late cooling stages ( needed for a muon collider ) coming later .",
    "the lower rf frequency used in early cooling stages relaxes requirements for timing - measurement resolution , thus simpler measurement approaches than indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mucool ] are now envisaged .",
    "rapid acceleration to the collider beam energy is needed to avoid excessive decay losses .",
    "this can be accomplished in a series of linacs and  racetrack \" recirculating linear accelerators ( rlas ) such as have been developed at jefferson laboratory .",
    "several scenarios have been considered . as an example",
    "@xcite , linacs at 175 and 350mhz can be employed to raise the energy of the cooled muon beam to 2gev , after which it is accelerated in a first 4-turn rla to 8gev and , in a second , to 30gev ( a possible storage - ring energy for a neutrino factory ) .",

    "it could also serve as a stepping - stone to a muon collider .",
    "a neutrino factory should be easier and cheaper to construct and operate than a muon collider since it requires less cooling and less intense muon bunches .",
    "this follows straightforwardly from the fact that collider luminosity , being proportional to the square of the bunch intensity and inversely proportional to the transverse bunch size , requires as small and intense a bunch as possible , while the sensitivity of neutrino experiments is determined simply by the time - integrated flux . in practice",
    "this eases the six - dimensional cooling required by a factor @xmath47 , possibly obviating the need for longitudinal - transverse emittance exchange .",
