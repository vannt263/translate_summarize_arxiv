    "perturbative gauge theories are the most successful models for description of the fundamental interactions in nature , where the coupling constant is small",
    ". one of the most successful of these gauge theories is the quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , a theory that describes the interaction of fermionic charged particles with electromagnetic field . in the qed framework , the one - loop analysis for the physical quantities , such as the electron anomalous magnetic moment and the lamb shift effect in the energy levels of hydrogen atom , gives us theoretical predictions which are in excellent agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "in fact , the most accurate low - energy measurement of the electromagnetic fine structure constant ( the strength of the electromagnetic interaction ) originates from the electron anomalous magnetic moment , which was measured precisely using a single electron caught in a penning trap @xcite .    as we know",
    ", some physical quantities in a field theory do vary with the related energy scale @xmath3 in which it is considered ; for example , the value of the fine structure constant runs with growing energy scale @xmath3 . in order to account such behavior of all physical quantities ,",
    "the renormalization group program can suitably be used so that we can define consistently the physical outcomes for a given field theory @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in this context , two functions play a major role , they are the beta and gamma functions , that measure the running of a coupling constant on the energy scale @xmath3 and the anomalous dimension of correlators , respectively . for instance , perturbative analysis for qed shows that the one - loop @xmath0-function is found as @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "this physically means that the coupling increases with increasing energy scale so that qed becomes strongly coupled at high energies .",
    "besides , to describe the dynamics of spinless charged fields interacting with photons , a suitable framework is the scalar quantum electrodynamics ( sqed ) , and it is known that its one - loop beta function is expressed by @xmath6 ( with @xmath7 ) @xcite . by a simple comparison of this result to that one from qed , it is easily realized that the sign of the both @xmath0-functions is positive , showing thus that qed and sqed are infrared free , and moreover that the following identity holds @xmath8 in which we understand that the coefficient 4 comes from the trace over the gamma matrices due to fermionic loops .",
    "we can then observe that the _ spin _ , as an additional degree of freedom for interacting charged fields in qed , only changes the _ intensity _ of the @xmath0-function and not its _ sign_. besides , if we consider additional degrees of freedom for a spinning charged fields such as color , e.g. in quark matter , then once again it will be observed that the _ sign _ of the @xmath0-function for the model describing the interaction of quarks with photons , does not change . on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the @xmath0-function for the interaction of quarks with gluons in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) does basically change in comparison to the latter case , since the internal gauge symmetry now is completely changed @xcite .",
    "as it is known the study of noncommutative gauge theories along the years have uncovered several interesting physical properties @xcite , so that it would be valuable to investigate whether the relation is also satisfied for the noncommutative setup .",
    "in other words , the posed questions whether or not adding a new degree of freedom to charged fields in a noncommutative spacetime only changes the intensity of the @xmath0-function ?",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to understand how does the noncommutativity affect on the structure of the @xmath0-functions for these qed and sqed theories .",
    "the answer to the second question in the case of noncommutative qed has already been studied @xcite , which is given by @xmath9 the obtained result is independent of the noncommutativity parameter @xmath10 , but its structure is completely different from its commutative counterpart . indeed , the one - loop contributions of the relevant graphs to this @xmath0-function arise only from the planar parts , while the non - planar parts are all finite .",
    "although the non - planar part of the respective diagrams does not contribute to the @xmath0-function at one - loop order , the noncommutative effects are actually presented by means of the new couplings engendered by the noncommutativity of spacetime coordinates .",
    "the structure of is similar to those from nonabelian gauge theories , in particular the @xmath11 gauge theory . besides",
    ", we see that for @xmath12 , the theory reduces to a pure gauge part with a negative @xmath0-function which is asymptotically free .",
    "however , the one - loop @xmath0-function of the noncommutative sqed has not yet been computed , the exact form of the one - loop @xmath0-function for nc - sqed could be naively obtained through the relation and the aforementioned considerations in . to this end",
    ", we notice that the contribution @xmath13 originates just from the pure gauge sector hence this part should also be present in nc - sqed , while the second term , including the matter sector , similar to the commutative case would have a different coefficient ( due to its spinless structure ) .",
    "consequently , we find @xmath14 one of the main goals in this paper is to correctly establish the above result in a more detailed analysis , by considering the interaction among the spinless matter and gauge fields in the noncommutative sqed .",
    "some general discussions on the renormalization of sqed have been considered before @xcite , but with a different scope than ours .",
    "more importantly , renormalization of noncommutative gauge theories must be treated carefully and is still subject of analysis @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is worth to notice the similarity between the @xmath0-functions of the noncommutative abelian gauge theory and commutative non - abelian gauge theory presented above .",
    "hence , we will discuss along the paper to what extend this similarity holds , and also about the role played by the spin of matter field in the @xmath0-function of these theories .",
    "therefore , the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , after introducing the lagrangian of the nc - sqed model and its invariance under the brst slavnov transformations , we present the relevant feynman rules used in our one - loop calculations .",
    "then in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we discuss the renormalization procedure for the full lagrangian density and in particular specify the related renormalization constants for the matter , gauge and the interaction terms .",
    "besides we show these renormalization constants satisfy in the slavnov - taylor identities .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , the one - loop analysis for the self - energy of the gauge , scalar and the ghost field is performed that yields us the one - loop renormalization constants for the related fields . as well as , the radiative correction to to three and four - point vertices , including two scalars - one photon and two scalars - two photons respectively ,",
    "is carried out in more details , which gives us two renormalization constants corresponding to two vertices .",
    "based on the obtained results for the renormalization constants , the one - loop @xmath0-function and also the anomalous dimensions of the scalar , gauge and ghosts fields are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "finally , the last section [ sec:6 ] is dedicated to the concluding remarks .",

    "the above lagrangian is invariant under brst slavnov transformations @xcite @xmath23 we will show next that the sqed in the noncommutative setup has the behavior upon the discrete symmetries similar to the noncommutative qed @xcite , this can be seen from the lagrangian density as follows    *  _ parity _ the transformation of the pure gauge sector under parity has been carried out in @xcite , where it was shown that the respective pure gauge terms in nc - qed model are invariant under parity without any change in sign of @xmath10 . to study the behavior of the matter part under parity , we consider the relevant term given by @xmath24 under parity , the complex scalar field transforms as @xmath25 in which the phase @xmath26 is arbitrary for a free field @xcite . besides the gauge field components change as @xmath27 and @xmath28 so that we easily conclude @xmath29 does not change under the parity and thus nc - sqed is parity invariant . *  _ charge conjugation _ under charge conjugation , we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is an arbitrary phase parameter @xcite . taking into account these changes as well as @xmath33 , we observe that the first term of @xmath29 goes to the second term and vice versa .",
    "furthermore , it is easily seen that the third term in does not change and then by considering the invariance of the gauge part as in @xcite we consequently deduce that nc - sqed is invariant under charge conjugation transformation ( _ with _",
    "@xmath33 ) .",
    "*  _ time reversal _ time reversal operator acts on the gauge and the scalar fields as @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . similar to the aforementioned discussion in charge conjugation",
    ", once again we see that the first and the second term of transform to each other and the third term remains unchanged , if we assume that @xmath33 . together with invariance of the gauge part",
    ", we realize that nc - sqed is time reversal invariant ( _ with _",
    "@xmath33 ) .    hence , from the above discussion on the discrete symmetries of nc - sqed",
    ", we reach a result which holds also for nc - qed , and was already found in ref .",
    "actually , it is understood that nc - sqed is parity invariant without assumption @xmath33 and hence this is the same as the commutative setup . while in order to have charge conjugation and time reversal invariance , we should take into account _",
    "transformation for the noncommtativity parameter as @xmath33 .",
    "hence , nc - sqed , similar to nc - qed , is a * cp*-violating model , but * cpt * invariant .",
    "next , based on the gauge - fixed lagrangian one can integrated over the auxiliary field @xmath20 , so we can derive all the necessary feynman rules for the propagators and vertex functions    * gauge field propagator ( at feynman gauge @xmath37 ) @xmath38 * scalar field propagator @xmath39 * ghost field propagator @xmath40 * three - point vertex @xmath1 @xmath41 * four - point vertex @xmath2 @xmath42 * three - point vertex @xmath43 @xmath44 * the cubic gauge vertex @xmath45.\\ ] ] * the quartic gauge vertex @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    before proceeding in computing the one - loop corrections to the basic functions we shall now establish the renormalization of the given theory .",

    "in this paper we have considered the scalar qed defined in a noncommutative spacetime , established its renormalizability and computed the one - loop order radiative corrections . in addition , we have showed the brst slavnov transformations leaving the gauge - fixed lagrangian invariant and discussed how the discrete symmetries are changed under the noncommutative setup .",
    "the multiplicative renormalization has been applied to the nc scalar qed , so that the respective counter - term lagrangian was obtained .",
    "moreover , the slavnov - taylor identities were used in order to show a series of identities relating all the renormalization constants of the theory .",
    "these identities are valuable since they allow us to determine the remaining constants from the knowledge of some renormalization constants without further calculation . to conclude the section we wrote the renormalized group equation for the two - point function for the gauge field in order to introduce the @xmath0-function for the gauge coupling and the @xmath71-function for the dynamical fields .",
    "after establishing the renormalization of the model , we proceeded in computing the one - loop order radiative corrections to the basic functions .",
    "we focused on those simpler contributions that allowed us to compute the full set of renormalization constants : gauge , charged scalar and ghost fields self - energies , three- and four - point vertex functions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we called special attention to those graphs that were exclusively from noncommutative nature , going to zero at the commutative limit .",
    "only the counter - term @xmath178 related to the vertex @xmath1 had a null value ( finite contribution only ) , all the others counter - terms absorbed the respective divergent part of the self - energy and vertex functions .",
    "it should be emphasized that , based on the obtained results , the remaining renormalization constants @xmath51 , @xmath56 and @xmath53 can immediately be determined by means of the gauge identities .    to conclude we computed the @xmath0-function for the gauge coupling and the anomalous dimensions for the dynamical fields @xmath179 . in order to highlight the obtained result for the @xmath0-function",
    ", we compare it with the nc qed and commutative sym @xmath0-function expressions  as a matter of fact , the gauge sector is strictly the same and differences are only found in the matter sector contribution .",
