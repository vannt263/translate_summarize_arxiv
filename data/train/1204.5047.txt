    "as conventional electronics approach the limits of miniaturization,@xcite the focus of research is on developing devices that encode information using not only the charge of electrons but also their intrinsic spin .",
    "the long coherence time of spins and the ease of manipulating spins with external magnetic fields translates into devices that are more robust , smaller and more energy efficient than charge based devices .",
    "the essential building blocks of any spintronic device are a ) a source of spin polarized current called a spin injector , b ) a system that is sensitive to the presence of non - equilibrium spin called a spin detector , and c ) a system that manipulates spins , either by application of external magnetic fields or by utilizing effective fields that arise out of spin orbit coupling in the substrate material .",
    "spin manipulation can also be achieved through confinement geometries of the transport channel .",
    "half - metals , a new class of compounds which exhibit large carrier spin polarizations , show promising features for spintronics applications , owing to the coexistence of the metallic nature of conduction in one spin orientation and an insulating nature for the other spin orientation.@xcite many theoreticians and experimentalists are enthusiastically pursuing the search for stable materials which have half - metallic and spin filter properties and thus can have huge potential in advanced spintronic devices.@xcite    organometallic sandwich complexes are fast emerging as promising candidates for the role of a source of spin polarized current . the discovery of ferrocene @xmath1 in 1951@xcite initiated interest in the field of organometallic compounds .",
    "further work resulted in the synthesis of several derivatives of @xmath1.@xcite with the development of gas - phase synthesis of organometallic compounds with the aid of laser vapourization , a major impediment to the synthesis of multidecker sandwich complexes had been overcome .",

    "@xmath16 is ( -2 times ) the imaginary part of the self - energies of the left and right electrodes ( @xmath17=l , r ) .",
    "in the followings , all our discussions are mainly based on the results obtained using siesta package unless and otherwise it is mentioned . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we present the optimized geometries of @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] , @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath12_\\infty}$ ] smws . in each structure ,",
    "the metal atom has @xmath18 and @xmath19 types of coordination with cp and bz rings on opposite sides .",

    "we find all the systems to be ferromagnetically stabilized and thus have a magnetically polarized state irrespective of the basis set ( localized or plane wave ) and functionals ( gga or b3lyp ) used . in order to estimate the ferromagnetic stability , we calculate the energy difference ( @xmath27 ) between the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and the anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) state .",
    "note that , the negative sign of @xmath27 indicates the stabilization of the fm state over the afm state .",
    "the large magnitude of @xmath27 ( see table . [ magtable ] ) indicates the high stability of the fm state even at room temperature . from our calculations , we find that the net magnetic moment of the unit cell is 3@xmath23for @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] , and 4@xmath23for @xmath12_\\infty}$ ] smws ( see table [ magtable ] ) , and this value almost remain same for the plane wave basis and b3lyp functional . a local magnetic moment of 1.7@xmath23on v and and 1.6@xmath23on fe atom are found in @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] wires , respectively .",
    "in fact , while two v ( or fe ) atoms contribute a positive magnetic moment of + 3.3@xmath23 , bz and cp rings together contribute a small negative moment of -0.3@xmath23to the total magnetic moment ( 3@xmath23 ) of the unit cell . while for smw of mixed metal , @xmath12_\\infty}$ ] , the net magnetic moment of the unit cell is 4@xmath23 , with a local magnetic moment of + 1.9@xmath23on v and + 2.4@xmath23on fe atoms . in order to obtain a better picture of electronic structure and the origin of magnetic moment , we display spin polarized band structures in figure [ fig2 ] . under @xmath28 and/or @xmath29",
    "symmetry of crystal field , the 3d orbitals of fe and v split into a singlet @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and two sets of doublets @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , we note that , although the isolated v atom has the valence electronic configuration @xmath34 , due to strong hybridization , the vanadium 4s levels are shifted above @xmath35 making the effective valence configuration @xmath36 . for @xmath37_\\infty}$ ] smws ( tm = transition metal ) , shen et al . have proposed a general mechanism which involves transfer of one electron from the metal atom to the cp ring.@xcite we utilize the same mechanism to explain the band structure and origin of magnetic moment . note that , there are two d - derived bands for each of five d - orbitals .",
    "this is because there are two metal atoms in the primitive cell of our smws .",
    "hence , there are always two bands for each band of @xmath30 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 symmetry . in the rest of our discussion ,",
    "when we mention two bands of @xmath38 ( or @xmath39 ) symmetry , it is implied that it consists of 4 bands .",
    "the unit cell of @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] contains two v atoms , i.e. , ten d - electrons . following the transfer of 1 electron from v atoms to the cp ligand ,",
    "the total number of d - electrons becomes 9 . from the band structure ,",
    "it is clear that out of these 9 d - electrons , 6 majority spin electrons completely fill two bands of @xmath30 and two bands of @xmath38 symmetry , leading to the opening of an semiconducting gap of 0.98 ev at the @xmath40 point in the majority channel . out of the remaining 3 d - electrons ,",
    "2 electrons completely fill one of the two minority bands which have @xmath38 symmetry , the other minority band being partially filled by the remaining 1 electron .",
    "in fact , due to such partial filling , one of the @xmath38 bands crosses @xmath35 in the minority spin channel , leading to metallic behavior in the electronic structure for minority spins .",
    "the important point to note here is that , we have a coexistence of the metallic and semiconducting nature for electrons in the minority and majority spin channels , respectively , which leads to half - metallic behavior for the @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] smw .",
    "it is clear from the band structure that , two localized @xmath30 bands , which are completely filled for majority spin and completely empty for the minority spin channel , contribute magnetic moment of 2@xmath23and the partially filled @xmath38 band contributes 1@xmath23to the total magnetic moment of 3@xmath23 .",
    "we would like to point out that , due to strong hybridization , the states with the @xmath39 symmetry move far away from the fermi level and remain silent in transport and magnetic behaviors . very interestingly , @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] shows a nice spin switching behavior around fermi energy . as it is clear from figure [ fig2 ] ( green and yellow shaded regions ) , only majority spin states are allowed in the energy window from -1.5 ev to -0.6 ev while only minority spin states are favored in the energy window from -0.6 to 1.1 ev , showing a clear spin switching behavior . note that , this kind of spin switching behavior is not noticed in the band structure of @xmath7_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath6_\\infty}$ ] .",
    "similarly , for @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] , the effective electronic configuration for fe is @xmath41 . as the smw contains two fe atoms and one of the d - electrons",
    "is transferred from fe , 15 d - electrons are available for filling the bands . out of these 15 d - electrons , 6",
    "minority electrons completely fill two bands of @xmath38 symmetry and two bands of @xmath30 symmetry , leading to the opening of a semiconducting gap of 1.05 ev at the @xmath40 point in the minority spin channel . while out of the remaining 9 electrons , 8 majority electrons completely fill two bands of each from @xmath38 and @xmath30 symmetry and one of the bands of @xmath39 symmetry .",
    "the remaining 1 majority spin electron partially fills the other band of @xmath39 symmetry and hence crosses the fermi level , leading to metallic behavior in the majority spin channel .",
    "thus , @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] wire is a perfect ferromagnetic half - metal .",
    "one of the @xmath39 bands which is completely filled for majority spin and completely empty for minority spin electrons , contributes a magnetic moment of 2@xmath23and the other partially filled @xmath39 band contributes 1@xmath23to the total magnetic moment ( 3@xmath23 ) of the system .",
    "we wish to emphasize here that , the orbitals of @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) symmetry play an important role in the magnetic interaction in @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] , while for the case of @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] , the orbitals of @xmath39 symmetry ( @xmath45 ) are important for magnetism . interestingly , @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] also show spin switching behavior unlike @xmath46_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath47_\\infty}$ ] ( see the shaded regions in figure [ fig2 ] ) .    for the mixed metal smw , @xmath12_\\infty}$ ] ,",
    "out of the total 12 d - electrons , 8 majority spin electrons completely fill two bands of @xmath30 ( both v and fe contribute ) , two bands of @xmath38 and one band of @xmath39 ( derived from fe ) .",
    "four minority spin electrons fill completely one @xmath30 ( derived from fe only ) band , one of the @xmath38 and partially the other @xmath38 band .",
    "further , we find that one of the @xmath30 bands ( derived from v ) contributes 1@xmath23 , @xmath39 ( derived mostly from fe ) contributes 2@xmath23and one of the @xmath38 contributes 1@xmath23 , to the total moment of 4@xmath23 in the unit cell .",
    "a wide gap of 2.72 ev opens up at the zone boundary ( x point ) in the majority spin channel , while due to partial filling , bands of @xmath38 symmetry cross the fermi level in the minority spin channel , making the system a strong half - metal .",
    "in fact , we would like to stress that , due to the large magnetic moment , the @xmath12_\\infty}$ ] system would be much more useful for molecular magnets .    in order to verify the results indicating half - metallicity that were obtained using localized basis and gga functional , we perform additional calculations for all the systems within plane wave basis as well as within the hybrid b3lyp functional",
    ". we present the dos plots for the different levels of calculations for all the systems in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "as can be seen , at the fermi level a gap opens for one spin channel , while there is a finite density of states for the other spin channel , leading to the half - metallicity in all the systems .",
    "all the systems retain their half - metallicity irrespective of the level of the calculations .",

    "all the finite size clusters are optimized and then the structural stabilities are verified by the calculation of their harmonic vibrational frequencies .",
    "we consider a nonmagnetic 3x3x3 bulk gold electrode ( au ( 111 ) plane ) consisting of 27 au atoms for transport calculations . following the calculation of optimized geometries for each of the isolated finite size clusters , we calculate the optimal separation between a single electrode and the finite cluster",

    "we find that the potential at the border of scattering region approaches quite well to the bulk values of gold electrode , which confirms that our inclusion of only three layers of gold into the scattering region is good enough to have less scattering at the interface . in figure [ fig4](b )",

    "table [ transtable ] lists the gaps between the homo and the lumo in the majority and minority spin channels ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "it is clear that larger the difference in the value of the homo - lumo gap between both the spin channel ( @xmath50 - @xmath51 ) , the larger is the @xmath49 value . to understand the high spin filter efficiency of au - bzvcpvbz - au , in figure [ fig5 ] ( a ) we plot the total dos of electrode - molecule - electrode ( eme ) system and its projection ( pdos ) onto the molecular states .",
    "as can been seen , the transmission spectra shows a series of peaks with strong correlation between transmission and pdos spectra , especially with regard to the location of their peaks .",
    "these transmission peaks correspond to the resonant transmission through molecular states .",
    "transmission shows a peak only when molecular states resonate with the states of the electrodes . in a low energy window around the fermi energy ,",
    "the vanishing contribution of molecular states to the eigenstates of the system leads to a case of weak resonance , which in turn makes the transmission zero ( negligible ) for majority spin electrons . while due to strong resonance , minority spin electrons show strong transmission peaks near the fermi level .",
    "looking once again at the plots of homo and lumo for majority and minority spin electrons in figure [ fig5 ] ( b ) , it can be seen that due to weak coupling of molecular orbitals and incident states from the electrode , the homo and lumo rarely contribute to the transmission for majority spin . while the homo and lumo for the minority spin show a strong transmission peak because of the strong resonance of molecular states with the electrode .        as actual devices work at a finite bias , in figure [ fig6 ] we present @xmath0 characteristics .",
    "the spin filtering effect is clearly illustrated by the @xmath0 plot .",
    "particularly , in the case of au - bzvcpvbz - au , when bias is applied , the current reaches up to several @xmath62a for the minority spin component , however remains almost zero for the majority spin component . to quantify it",
    ", we define spin polarization at finite bias in terms of spin - resolved currents @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 represent minority and majority currents , respectively .",
    "it is quite clear that , all the systems show efficient spin filtering , while au - bzvcpvbz - au notably shows a very high value of @xmath61 = 96.5% at a bias voltage , @xmath66 = 0.6 v. besides the spin filtering , an interesting negative differential resistance ( ndr)@xcite effect is also observed in the bias range of 1.4 - 1.6 v for au - bzfecpfebz - au system . to understand the ndr behavior",
    ", we plot the total transmission function t(e , v@xmath67 ) of au - bzfecpfebz - au system at various bias in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "the current is calculated by the landauer - buttiker formula @xmath68 .",
    "the transmission coefficient @xmath69 is the function of the energy ( e ) and bias window @xmath66 ( integral window ) .",
    "the current thus depends upon the integral area ( namely , the shaded area in figure [ fig7 ] ) which is related to two factors : one is the transport coefficient and the other is the magnitude of the bias window . in figure",
    "[ fig7 ] , we mark the three significant peaks ( @xmath70 ) in @xmath71 . as the bias increases these peaks gradually shift toward the low - energy side , accompanied by a change in height .",
    "when @xmath66 reaches 1.4 v , the peak @xmath72 drifts into the bias window , which in turn increases the available integral area , resulting in a significant rise in the electric current . when @xmath66 further increases to 1.6 v , the peak value of @xmath72 reduces , reducing available integral area and results in a drop in current , which causes ndr .",

    "pressure can imply either compression or stretching , which we model by changing the lattice constant .",
    "as @xmath9_\\infty}$]wire shows strong half - metallicity and its finite size cluster shows efficient spin - filter property , we choose @xmath9_\\infty}$]wire as a case study to understand the effect of pressure . in figure",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the the energy of @xmath9_\\infty}$]scaled to the corresponding energy at equilibrium lattice constant ( @xmath78 ) together with band gap and magnetic moment as a function of the lattice constant .",
    "we find that , with the application of pressure , the afm state is favored less , as compared to fm or non - magnetic ( nm ) states . while subject to stretching , the majority spin gap initially remains constant , and then suddenly drops to zero at a critical value of @xmath77z = z-@xmath79 = 0.3  . as the @xmath77z increases beyond this point , the minority spin gap begins to open .",
    "this is because , on stretching , the partially occupied minority spin @xmath38 band is pushed above @xmath35 as a fractional charge flows from this band to the upper lying majority spin band of @xmath39 symmetry which in turn passes through the fermi level ( see figure [ fig8 ] : right panel ) .",
    "thus , the transition is accompanied by an abrupt jump in the magnetic moment from 3 @xmath23to 3.8 @xmath23and then to 5 @xmath23 . under compression , the majority spin gap gradually reduces and abruptly drops to zero at a critical point , @xmath77z = -0.8  , taking the system from a half - metallic to a metallic phase .",
    "this abrupt fall in band gap results in a sudden fall of magnetic moment of the system from 3 @xmath23 to 0 @xmath23 .",
    "thus with the application of pressure , the system swaps from a highly ferromagnetic half - metallic phase to a non - magnetic metallic phase , which was not observed in @xmath7_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath6_\\infty}$ ] .",
    "it is well know that the magnitude of the magnetic moment is strongly related to the lattice constant ( or the volume ) of the system .",
    "a possible reason for this dependence is the magneto - volume effect.@xcite owing to the pauli exclusion principle for parallel spins , the electron kinetic energy of a spin - polarized state is higher , and volume expansion relaxes the kinetic energy .",
    "consequently , the high - spin state has a larger volume than the low - spin state .",
    "we here stress that the half - metallicity of @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] is still conserved for stretching of upto 20% length and compression of upto 12% length of the wire .",
    "we investigate multidecker metal - cyclopentadienyl - benzene smws which are derived from metal - cyclopentadienyl and metal - benzene wires .",
    "our study finds that all the examined smws are highly stable ferromagnetic half - metals , with @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] and @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] notebly showing spin switching behaviour . with regard to the origin of magnetic moment in these smws",
    ", @xmath38 and @xmath30 bands are responsible for @xmath9_\\infty}$ ] , while on the other hand , the @xmath39 band alone contributes to the moment in @xmath11_\\infty}$ ] .",
    "the finite size clusters are found to exhibit an efficient spin filter property ( especially bzvcpvbz ) when coupled to au electrodes on either side .",
    "this has been attributed to the strong resonance between minority spin states of the electrode and those of the molecular cluster .",
    "a close examination of @xmath0 characteristics for all systems clearly shows spin filtering , with au - bzvcpvbz - au displaying exceptionally high performance at a bias voltage of 0.6 v. in addition to spin filtering properties , the au - bzfecpfebz - au system also show ndr . additionally , the behaviour of @xmath9_\\infty}$]when subjected to compression and stretching is also studied .",
    "the magneto - volume effect is evident as an abrupt change in magnetic moment on stretching and a sudden transition to a non - magnetic ordering with application of pressure .",
    "half - metallicity is preserved for modest amounts of stretching and compression .",
    "owing to better structural stability and robust electronic behaviour , we conjecture that ( v and/or fe)-cyclopentadienyl - benzene systems could be valuable for spintronics applications .",
