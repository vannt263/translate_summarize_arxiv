    "in modern competitive research in science and technology high performance computing plays a paramount role .",
    "its importance is derived from the fact , that correctly chosen and designed numerical methods and algorithms properly adapted to parallel and multithreaded techniques can essentially reduce computation time and active memory usage @xcite .",
    "the importance of this fact is especially magnified in calculating quantum molecular dynamics and atomic collisions due to their massive complexity .",
    "generally speaking , modern computation research in scientific applications has taken two twists .",
    "first , to provide efficient and stable numerical calculations , and second to provide for the proper use of various high performance techniques like lam / mpi , openmp and/or others @xcite .",
    "now it is equally important not only to get the correct numerical results , but also to design and implement efficient high performance algorithms and get faster results with less memory .",
    "we would like to note here , that a program / software , which is designed for specific problems in computational physics , chemistry or biology should be able to perform calculations in either serial or parallel .",
    "the problem we selected for our parallel computation in this work is taken from molecular / chemical physics .",
    "specifically we carry out _ detailed _ quantum - mechanical calculations of state - resolved cross sections and rates in hydrogen molecular collisions h@xmath0+h@xmath0 .",
    "interaction and collisions between hydrogen molecules , and hydrogen molecular isotopes , for example h@xmath0+hd , is of great theoretical and experimental interest for many years [ 3 - 14 ] .",
    "specifically we will explore the quantum - mechanical 4-atomic system shown in fig .  1 using six independent variables resulting in the full description of the system",
    ". the main goal of this investigation is to carry out a comparative analysis of two recently published potential energy surfaces ( pess ) for h@xmath3h@xmath0 .",
    "our motivation for selecting this problem is , that the hydrogen molecule plays an important role in many areas of astrophysics [ 15 - 16 ] this is the simplest and most abundant molecule in the universe especially in giant molecular clouds . because of low number of electrons in h@xmath3h@xmath0 this is one of few four - center systems for which potential energy surface ( pes ) can be developed with very high precision .",
    "therefore h@xmath0+h@xmath0 may be also a benchmark collision for testing other dynamical methods .",
    "additionally , the h@xmath0+h@xmath0 elastic and inelastic collisions are of interest in combustion , spacecraft modeling and at the present hydrogen gas is becoming a very important potential energy supplier , see for example @xcite .",
    "we test two pess : the first one is a global 6-dimensional potential from work @xcite , the second one is very accurate interaction potential calculated from the first principles @xcite . because we are going to carry out detailed quantum - mechanical calculations using two pess",
    "the computation work is at least doubled and therefore even more time consuming .",
    "we needed to carry out convergence tests with respect to different chemical and numerical parameters for both pess and , finally , we have to make production calculations for many points of kinetic energy collisions .",
    "clearly , an application of parallel computing techniques shall be very useful in this situation .    in this work",
    "we carry out parallel computation with up to 14 processors .",
    "the scattering cross sections and their corresponding rate coefficients are calculated using a non reactive quantum - mechanical close - coupling approach . in the next section",
    "we will shortly outline the quantum - mechanical method and the parallelization approach .",

    "for the bmkp pes we used @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "we also applied a few different propagators included in the molscat program .    a convergence test with respect to the maximum value of the total orbital momentum showed , that @xmath74 is good enough for the considered range of energies in this work .",

    "nontheless , for our production calculations we used the first basis set .",
    "it is important to point out here , that for comparison purposes we do nt include the compensating factor of 2 mentioned in @xcite .",

    "depending on number of parallel processors @xmath83 using the dynamic approach , see text . ]",
    "the differences in the cross sections of the two potentials are reflected in the state - resolved transition states @xmath84 , as shown in fig .  5 ( right panel ) .",
    "it seems that the dj pes can provide much better results , as seen in the same figure in the left panel , when we present the results for the corresponding thermal rates @xmath65 calculated with the dj potential together with results of other theoretical calculations .",
    "the agreement is perfect .",
    "thus , one can conclude , that dj pes is better suited for the h@xmath3h@xmath0 system . in fig .",
    "6 we provide thermal rates for different transition states calculated with only the dj pes and in comparison with other theoretical data obtained within different dynamical methods and pess .",
    "again the agreement is very good .    in fig .",
    "7 we present an example of our timing results using the dynamic method for a specific h@xmath85+h@xmath86 calculations .",
    "it can be seen , that including additional processors reduces the computation time . here",
    "we present two results .",
    "the left plot shows dependence of the computing time on amount of active parallel processors .",
    "the right plot illustrates the degree of speed - up of the calculations .",
    "the speed - up for a fixed test calculation is defined as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the calculation with only one processor and @xmath89 with @xmath83 processors .",
    "we carried out parallel computations for state - resolved rotational excitation and deexcitation cross sections and rates in molecular @xmath90-/@xmath90- and ortho-/ortho - h@xmath0 collisions of astrophysical interest .",
    "the lam / mpi technique allowed us to speed up the computation process at least @xmath91 times within our 14 processor sun unix cluster .",
    "we tested the two newest potential energy surfaces for the considered systems .",
    "thus the application of the parallel algorithm reduced the computation time used to test the two potentials .",
    "a test of convergence and the results for cross sections and rate coefficients using two different potential energy surfaces for the h@xmath3h@xmath0 system have been obtained for a wide range of kinetic energies .",
    "we would like to point out here , that the hydrogen problem is very important for many reasons .",
    "the main motivation has been described in the introduction of this paper .",
    "it is also necessary to stress , that the hydrogen - hydrogen collision may be particularly interesting in nanotechnology applications , when the system is confined inside a single wall carbon nanotube ( swnt ) @xcite .",
    "careful treatment of such collisions can bring useful information about the hydrogen adsorption mechanisms in swnts and quantum sieving selectivities @xcite .",
    "however , in this problem particular attention should be paid not only to the h@xmath3h@xmath0 potential , but also to the many body interaction between h@xmath0 molecules and the carbon nanotube [ 27 - 28 ] .",
    "the inclusion of additional complex potentials in the schrdinger equation may essentially increase the computation difficulties .",
    "it is also very attractive to upgrade the four - dimensional model for the linear rigid rotors used in this work to complete six - dimensional consideration of the h@xmath24h@xmath0 collisions .",
    "however , because of two additional integrations over @xmath92 and @xmath93 distances such calculations should be very time consuming @xmath94 here @xmath95 is the product of the real vibrational wavefunctions of the two molecules @xmath96 where @xmath97 designates the vibrational quantum numbers @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "nontheless , the application of a parallel computing techniques together with shared memory methodology could be a very effective computational approach , as it was partially demonstrated in this work .",
    "although our calculations revealed , that both the h@xmath3h@xmath0 pess used in this work can provide the same type of behaviour in regard to cross sections and rates , there are still significant differences . considering the results of these calculations we conclude that subsequent work is needed to further improve the h@xmath3h@xmath0 pes , and that work will require parallel processing if it is to be done in a timely manner .",
