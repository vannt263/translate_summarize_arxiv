    "a large class of extensions of general relativity is described in the context of scalar - tensor theories of gravity  @xcite , where a space - time metric @xmath1 is coupled to a scalar field @xmath2 , with the other matter contents such as fermion fields being minimally coupled to gravity . by an appropriate conformal transformation @xmath3 we can move to another frame .",
    "a prime example is the einstein frame , where after the conformal transformation ( [ ct ] ) the gravitational action becomes the einstein - hilbert one .",
    "these conformal frames are mathematically equivalent , so one can work in any frame as long as mathematical manipulations are concerned .",
    "it is , however , not explicitly clear whether these conformally related frames also enjoy physical equivalence  @xcite .",
    "in cosmology , we encounter various frames of the metric which are related by conformal transformation , such as jordan frame , einstein frame , string frame and so on .",
    "the physical equivalence between these frames is especially important , since the cosmological observations with improving sensitivity can probe gravitational theories on the largest observable scales  @xcite .",
    "further , some models of the early universe which accounts for the primordial perturbations incorporate non - minimal coupling between gravity and a scalar field , such as the recently proposed standard model higgs inflation  @xcite .",
    "usually one moves from the original , jordan frame to the einstein frame by a conformal transformation , and then computes perturbations there .",
    "the invariance of the vector and tensor perturbations , and that of the scalar perturbation in the comoving gauge , are shown up to second order  @xcite , but it is not clear if this invariance holds fully non - perturbatively . regarding precise upcoming experiments that may detect non - linear signatures such as non - gaussianity , it is important to clarify the full non - linear invariance of the perturbations  @xcite .    in this article , we study the conformal invariance of the cosmological perturbation . our particular attention will be given to the curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales .",
    "we will show that in the single component case all perturbations in the comoving slicing are conformally invariant to fully non - linear order .",
    "once this is given , we can see that in the context of the @xmath0 formalism it is a matter of gauge transformation between different coordinate systems which impose different slicing conditions .    as a temporal gauge condition",
    ", we take the conformal transformation factor @xmath4 to be unperturbed to full non - linear order .",
    "this may be called as the uniform - conformal - transformation slicing , or , uniform @xmath4 slicing ( u@xmath4s ) .",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath4 into the background and perturbation as @xmath5 , then the u@xmath4s means @xmath6 as the slicing condition .",
    "thus we have @xmath7 under this slicing condition it is obvious , almost a tautology , that all perturbed quantities are naturally invariant under the conformation transformation .",
    "this result applies even in multiple component situation : see ( [ uomegag - fr ] ) and ( [ uomegag - fphi ] ) for relations implied by this slicing condition to non - linear orders of perturbation .",
    "note that we may consider the action given by @xmath8\\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath4 is a function of either the field @xmath2 for @xmath9-type gravity or a function of @xmath10 or @xmath11 for @xmath12-type gravity , where @xmath13 in these cases , the u@xmath4s corresponds to the uniform - field slicing or the uniform-@xmath10 slicing , respectively , and we may call it as the ufs .",
    "first , we consider the single field @xmath14-type gravity in which we can show the invariance , especially that of the curvature perturbation . as for our spatial metric , we write @xmath15 where @xmath16 includes vector and tensor perturbations .",
    "we choose @xmath17 such that it remains invariant under the conformal transformation as described in detail in appendix  [ app : confgamma ] . then , under the conformal transformation ( [ ct ] ) , ( [ spatialmetric ] ) becomes @xmath18\\widetilde{\\gamma}_{ij }",

    "further , as spelled out in appendix  [ app : confgamma ] , the vector and tensor perturbations in @xmath21 defined with respect to a fixed fiducial background metric are also conformally invariant to fully non - linear order .    in the single component case ,",
    "the u@xmath4s implies @xmath22 , the uniform field gauge or the comoving gauge for @xmath14-type gravity : in most scalar - tensor theories of gravity , the conformal transformation is a function of @xmath2 , @xmath23 .",
    "this result has an important implication that , for @xmath14 gravity  @xcite all perturbation variables in the uniform field gauge are conformally invariant . in ( [ conformalspatialmetric ] ) , we have explicitly shown the invariance to all perturbation orders , and also have shown that why the invariance is natural in the u@xmath4s which is the same as the uniform field gauge , or equivalently comoving gauge , in the single component case .",
    "now , we provide a complementary point of view using the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite in the universe dominated by a single scalar field @xmath2 .",
    "since we will be interested in super - horizon scales in terms of the @xmath0 formalism , we restrict ourselves to zeroth order in @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the comoving wavenumber of a characteristic perturbation of our interest .",
    "we consider a point on a comoving slice on which @xmath22 .",
    "hereafter we use the subscript @xmath26 to denote the quantities evaluated on the comoving slices , and likewise @xmath27 and @xmath28 on the flat and @xmath29 slices ( see below ) .",
    "when the universe is dominated by a single component @xmath2 , the comoving slice is the same as the u@xmath4s , thus @xmath30 .",
    "that is , the comoving curvature perturbation is the same and is thus conformally invariant .    until this point",
    "we have not yet related the perturbation in the number of @xmath31-folds @xmath0 to @xmath32 .",
    "we can compute @xmath33 in the standard manner . from ( [ spatialmetric ] ) , the expansion scalar @xmath34 , viz .",
    "the `` local '' hubble parameter is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lapse function . from this , the number of @xmath31-folds @xmath33 is given by the integral of @xmath37 along the proper time @xmath38 as @xmath39   + { { \\cal r}}(t_e ) - { { \\cal r}}(t_i ) \\equiv n_0 + { { \\cal r}}(t_e ) - { { \\cal r}}(t_i ) \\ , .\\ ] ] here , @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the initial and the final moments respectively .",
    "now , we consider the conformally transformed frame .",
    "we can take similar steps to obtain @xmath42 and @xmath43 , so that the number of @xmath31-folds in this frame @xmath44 becomes @xmath45   + \\overline{{{\\cal r}}}(t_e ) - \\overline{{{\\cal r}}}(t_i ) \\ , .\\ ] ] note that the background is _ different _ from @xmath46 as @xmath47   = n_0 + \\log \\left [ \\frac{\\omega_0(t_e)}{\\omega_0(t_i ) } \\right ]   \\equiv n_0 + \\delta_0 \\ , .\\ ] ]    here , we make a specific choice for the initial and final moments where we evaluate the number of @xmath31-folds and the curvature perturbation . as a reference point",
    ", we set the final moments in both frames to be identical on a comoving slice .",
    "that is , @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath49 and in both frames @xmath50 .",
    "this is the conformal invariance of @xmath32 we have seen above .",
    "meanwhile , in the frame without overbar , we set the initial moment to be flat so that @xmath51 , and in the other frame `` @xmath29 '' in the sense that @xmath52 .",
    "then , in the frame without overbar , we have @xmath53 and in the frame with overbar , @xmath54 that is , in both frames , @xmath55 . despite of the different background numbers of @xmath31-folds , their perturbations are invariant in both frames .",
    "notice that the curvature perturbation on a comoving slice @xmath32 and the field fluctuation on a flat slice @xmath56 are related by [ see eq .",
    "( 287 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] @xmath57 here we remind that we are working at zeroth order in @xmath58 .",
    "this relation holds at any arbitrary time .",
    "meanwhile , in the @xmath0 formalism , by construction there is no field fluctuation on the final comoving slice where we evaluate the curvature perturbation .",
    "thus , we are to relate the curvature perturbation on the _ final _ comoving slice @xmath59 to the field fluctuations on the _ initial _ flat slice @xmath60 . furthermore , using the fact that we are interested in the dynamics along a given background trajectory , we can show that up to second order in @xmath61 , @xmath62 we give detailed steps to find this relation in appendix  [ app : phasespace ] .",
    "once evaluated on a flat slice , this should be identical to @xmath59 as we have shown in ( [ deltaninv1 ] ) [ or ( [ deltaninv2 ] ) as well ] and is in perfect agreement with ( [ rc_deltaphif ] ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath63 , i.e. the curvature perturbation is conserved on large scales .",
    "given the fully non - perturbative invariance of @xmath32 in two frames , we can obtain a useful perturbative relation as follows .",
    "for this , it is convenient to insert another comoving slice common to the both frames between the initial and the final moments , and we denote by @xmath64 the time on this slice .",
    "since we are interested in the large scale limit where @xmath32 is conserved , the perturbations in the number of @xmath31-folds between the initial moments and @xmath64 in two frames , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , are identical to @xmath32 .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig .",

    "the comoving slice on which time is denoted by @xmath64 is common to both frames .",
    "their initial slices are set in such a way that in one frame we set the initial slice to satisfy @xmath68 . in the other frame , on the other hand ,",
    "we demand @xmath69 .",
    "we call the former and the latter to be `` flat '' and `` @xmath29 '' , and the quantities evaluated on these slices by a subscript @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively.,width=453 ]    then , from the frame without overbar , suppressing the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath46 on @xmath70 which is common , for arbitrary @xmath71 we have ) that @xmath72 can be written as a function of @xmath73 , so that we have a single degree of freedom in the phase space . ]",

    "likewise , we can write another relation , @xmath77 + \\delta_0^{(n)}[\\phi_0(t)]}{n ! } \\left [ \\overline{\\delta\\phi}_f(t ) \\right]^n \\ , .\\ ] ] note that we have the same background field @xmath73 , since it can be redefined in one frame to absorb the background conformal transformation factor @xmath78",
    ". then , essentially now we have three different gauges conditions : @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath22 , which correspond to @xmath29 , flat and comoving gauges respectively",
    ". we need a specific conformal transformation @xmath81 only to define the first gauge .",
    "thus , using appropriate coordinate transformation laws , we can freely move between different gauges and relate one to another .",
    "for example , we consider the coordinate transformation from @xmath82 and @xmath83 to @xmath64 , @xmath84 then , we only have to write the field fluctuations in terms of the translation @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",
    "since on the comoving slice there is no field fluctuation by construction , we have @xmath87 \\equiv \\phi_f(t_f,{\\bm x } ) = \\phi_0(t_f ) + \\delta\\phi_f(t_f,{\\bm x } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] and a similar relation holds for @xmath83 .",
    "then , using ( [ coordxform ] ) we can write @xmath88   \\equiv t_f + { { \\cal t}}(t_f,{\\bm x } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 dependence of @xmath86 on the right - hand side can be removed by iteratively using this relation .",
    "then , from ( [ phitc_phitf ] ) , we can find the linear relation between @xmath89 and @xmath90 as @xmath91 this linear relation is in agreement with the well - known linear gauge transformation law  @xcite as it should be .",
    "note that in fact it does not matter that we necessarily restrict ourselves to the transformation between two flat gauges , and hence we may drop all the subscript @xmath27 .",
    "general coordinate transformations at arbitrary time would work as well .",

    "we consider two cases :    \\(i ) the case with @xmath98 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath99 , which is an additional scalar field minimally coupled to gravity in the einstein frame .",
    "an equivalent formulation in terms of a brans - dicke type scalar field @xmath100 is given in appendix  [ sec : fr ] , with its relation to the canonical scalar field @xmath101 in the einstein frame .",
    "\\(ii ) the case with @xmath102 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath103 .",
    "hence there is no additional scalar field .",
    "we have @xmath104 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath105 we see that the effect of the conformal transformation is to change the non - linear sigma coupling term and the potential .",
    "these conformal transformation properties are presented in appendix  a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the universe is dominated by a single component , we have shown the conformal invariance of all perturbations in the comoving slicing , which is equivalent to the u@xmath4s . in the multi - component situation",
    "the u@xmath4s is different from the uniform field slicing @xmath106 of a chosen field component @xmath107 or the collective comoving slicing which sets @xmath108 in the energy - momentum tensor ( or @xmath109 in the collective fluid four - vector .",
    "it should be noted however that it is in general impossible to uniquely define the comoving slicing in the multi - component situation because @xmath110}$ ] may not be zero ) .",
    "consequently , the curvature perturbation in the gauge where @xmath111 is not conformally invariant : denoting the gauge @xmath111 by a subindex @xmath107 , to linear order , we have @xmath112 where @xmath113 so",
    "that clearly @xmath114 .    nevertheless , even in the multiple component situation we can take u@xmath4s with @xmath115 to arbitrary non - linear order . under this slicing condition",
    "we have @xmath116 , and similarly for all the other metric perturbation variables  @xcite .",
    "let us denote quantities in u@xmath4s by suffix @xmath117 , e.g. @xmath118 .    for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the meaning of u@xmath4s in the two cases of our interest . since @xmath115 implies @xmath119 , we have the following :    \\(i ) for @xmath120 , we have @xmath121 thus @xmath122 .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath123 we have @xmath124 this condition should be imposed among all the fields that appear in @xmath10 .    here",
    "we note that , in the spirit of the @xmath125 formalism , the final comoving hypersurface should be chosen such that there remains only a single adiabatic mode in the perturbation at and after that epoch .",
    "once the universe has entered this stage , we also have the conservation of the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath32 . at this stage ,",
    "the only dynamical degree of freedom coupled to gravity should be encoded in the function @xmath10 , where the u@xmath4s coincides with the comoving slicing ( as discussed below ) on super - horizon scales , and hence @xmath126constant and consequently @xmath4 depend non - trivially on the remaining dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "if it is not the case , then @xmath4 will be simply a constant , and the conformal invariance is trivial . ] .",
    "all the other degrees of freedom should either be died out by then or be purely isocurvature at and after that epoch in the sense that they have no coupling to gravity whatsoever .",
    "conversely , at a stage during which multiple components of matter or fields have their individual dynamics , @xmath118 is not conserved yet . at this stage , whether some quantities are conformally invariant or not is not really important .",
    "it is similar to the matter of the gauge choice .",
    "some quantities may be conserved in a certain gauge , which may be a mathematically useful fact but has no physical / observational significance . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath118 and all the other quantities defined in u@xmath4s are conformally invariant . but this would not help us much to understand the physics .",
    "it becomes useful and meaningful only after @xmath118 becomes to be conserved .",
    "now we address the relation between the comoving slicing condition and the u@xmath4s in the case of @xmath12 gravity , @xmath127 in the case of @xmath12-gravity the comoving slicing",
    "_ differs _ from the ufs in general even at linear order . in the case of a minimally coupled scalar field",
    "we have @xmath128 , thus @xmath129 implies @xmath130 to fully non - linear order which is the comoving slicing condition .",
    "whereas in the case of pure @xmath12 gravity , we have [ see eq .",

    "@xcite ] @xmath133 where @xmath134 .",
    "thus , the ufs condition @xmath135 does not imply @xmath136 in general in the original frame .",
    "however , one can show that the ufs condition coincides with the comoving slicing condition @xmath136 on super - horizon scales to full non - linear order provided that the decaying mode becomes negligible and there remains only a single adiabatic mode .",
    "one can show this with the help of the field equation for @xmath10 given by the trace of ( [ freq ] ) .",
    "one finds that it is identical to the background field equation on super - horizon scales , i.e. at each spatial point @xmath137 where a point means a hubble size region , if one replaces @xmath138 by @xmath139 .",
    "thus the general solution to full non - linear order is given by @xmath140 . then after the decaying mode has disappeared",
    ", @xmath141 becomes a function of @xmath10 itself similar to the case of standard slow - roll inflation .",
    "this implies that on ufs on which @xmath142 , @xmath141 is also a function of only @xmath138 .",
    "then on ufs we have @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the unit normal to the uniform @xmath10 slice , @xmath145 is the induced metric on the uniform @xmath10 slice , and @xmath146 is the proper time along @xmath147constant [ the shift vector is @xmath148 on super - horizon scales ] .",
    "in fact , this leads to the conservation of the curvature perturbation on the comoving slices  @xcite .    it may be instructive to spell out how this happens at linear order . in the ufs",
    "the perturbed field equation gives  @xcite @xmath149 thus the fact that there remains only a single adiabatic mode implies @xmath150 , and hence @xmath151 at leading order on super - horizon scales . also the fact @xmath150 implies @xmath152 at leading order",
    ". thus the field @xmath10 in ufs is actually given by @xmath153 .    in the above",
    ", we have considered the case when the field @xmath10 dominates the universe . in general",
    ", we may have other fields or matter which may have non - trivial background dynamics . in this multi - component situation",
    ", we have no conformal invariance of the comoving curvature perturbation ( if it can ever be sensibly defined ) .",
    "in this situation , we can still define a conformally invariant curvature perturbation , @xmath118 in u@xmath4s .",
    "as we discussed , however , @xmath118 will not be conserved if the multi - component matter or fields are still dynamical .",
    "it becomes to be conserved when the universe becomes dominated by a single adiabatic degree of freedom .",
    "assuming this degree of freedom is encoded in @xmath10 , we have the equivalence between u@xmath4s and the comoving slicing , and hence recover the conformal invariance of @xmath32 , namely @xmath126constant .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the non - perturbative conformal invariance of the cosmological perturbations . when the universe is dominated by a single component , the u@xmath4s and the comoving slicing coincide and the comoving curvature perturbation @xmath32 is conformally invariant fully non - perturbatively .",
    "consistent with the conformal invariance of @xmath32 , we have shown that the @xmath0 formalism gives identical results irrespective of the choice of conformal frames .",
    "when the universe is dominated by a multiple matter or field components , the comoving curvature perturbation is no longer conformally invariant .",
    "however , at and after the universe has settled down to a unique evolutionary trajectory , i.e. in an era when there remains only a single adiabatic mode , we recover the conservation of the comoving curvature perturbation on super - horizon scales and so it is conformally invariant .",

    "being the number of @xmath31-folds , @xmath33 describes where we are on a given background trajectory , while @xmath174 labels which background trajectory we follow .",
    "then , formally we can write @xmath61 as @xmath175 we can do the same for @xmath173 , but using @xmath176 we have @xmath177 multiplying by @xmath0 and using this relation to replace @xmath178 term in ( [ deltaphi ] ) , we have @xmath179 where we have omitted higher order derivative terms as well as pure @xmath180 terms , because now we only consider the perturbation _ along _ a given trajectory .    therefore , from ( [ deltaphi2 ] ) we can write @xmath0 up to second order as @xmath181 perturbatively expanding , we can find @xmath0 as @xmath182 where we have reversed the time order , @xmath183 , because in the context of the @xmath0 formalism it is defined to be the variation of @xmath33 due to the variation of the _ initial _ conditions .",
