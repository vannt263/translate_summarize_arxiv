    "axler and ramey ( personal communication ) have obtained the following interesting result : let @xmath11 denote the usual lebesgue space on the unit sphere @xmath12 with respect to the surface area measure on @xmath12 ; @xmath13 be a fixed point in @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the space of all harmonic polynomials which vanish at @xmath13 together with all their derivatives of order less than or equal to @xmath6 , and @xmath16 .",
    "then        _ @xmath15 is dense in @xmath11 if and only if @xmath17 .",
    "_    they also posed the following questions :    1 .",
    "does the above result remain valid if @xmath11 is replaced by any @xmath18 with @xmath19 ?",
    "2 .   could @xmath12 be replaced by more general surfaces ?",
    "we shall show here that the answer to the 1st question is yes .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the space of all continuous functions on @xmath12 that vanish at @xmath13 and the space of all continuous functions on @xmath12 .    for any positive integer @xmath6 , @xmath15 is dense in @xmath21 with the sup norm if and only if @xmath17 . when @xmath13 is not on the sphere , then @xmath20 is the same as @xmath22 .",
    "we shall not prove that the density fails when @xmath23 since it is rather obvious and we shall not explicitly deal with the case when @xmath24 , because the proof for @xmath25 can be imitated without any problems .",
    "we will derive theorem  2 as a corollary of a more general result for which we need to introduce some more notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be any compact set in @xmath14 , @xmath2 its boundary .",
    "we define a notion called ecc .",
    "( this is the well - known poincare s external cone condition . )",
    "we say that _ k satisfies _ ecc _ at a point _",
    "@xmath13 _ if there exists a closed solid truncated cone @xmath26 with vertex at @xmath13 such that @xmath27 .",
    "_    it is clear that to satisfy ecc at @xmath13 , @xmath13 must be on the boundary of @xmath0 and also that the set of points where @xmath0 satisfies ecc is dense in the boundary of @xmath0 . in order to see this ,",
    "take any point @xmath28 on the boundary of @xmath0 and a ball of radius @xmath29 with center at @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is arbitrary and positive .",
    "there must exist a point @xmath30 outside @xmath0 such that @xmath31 for otherwise @xmath28 would be an interior point of @xmath0 . now choose a nearest point to @xmath30 in @xmath0 , say @xmath32 . clearly @xmath33 and the ball of radius @xmath34 with center at @xmath30 is entirely contained in the ball of radius @xmath29 with center at @xmath28 .",
    "now @xmath32 must belong to the boundary of @xmath0 , must lie within a distance of @xmath29 from @xmath28 and satisfies ecc for @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath35 denote the space of all functions @xmath4 on @xmath0 such that @xmath4 vanishes at @xmath13 and is the restriction to @xmath0 of a function harmonic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the space of all functions @xmath4 on @xmath0 such that @xmath4 is the restriction to @xmath0 of a function , harmonic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 and it , together with all its derivatives of order @xmath37 vanish at @xmath13 .",
    "we shall assume the following well - known result :    _ let @xmath0 be any closed ball in @xmath14 and @xmath13 belong to @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath15 is dense in @xmath36 . _",
    "also we need    assume @xmath0 satisfies ecc at @xmath13 . then for any positive integer @xmath6 , @xmath38 @xmath39 with the sup norm .",
    "we shall supply a proof of this later .",
    "let @xmath0 be the closed unit ball in @xmath14 and @xmath13 belong to @xmath40 .",
    "certainly @xmath0 satisfies ecc at @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath4 belong to @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath41 be any positive number .",
    "it is well - known that there exists a harmonic polynomial @xmath42 such that @xmath43 let @xmath44 .",
    "then @xmath45 belongs to @xmath35 .",
    "but by theorem  3 , there exists a @xmath46 in @xmath47 such that @xmath48 and so @xmath49 .",
    "this proves theorem 2 in view of lemma a.    since @xmath20 is dense in all @xmath18 for @xmath50 , from theorem 2 , we have    @xmath51    for any @xmath52 ; for any positive integer @xmath6 , and any point @xmath13 on @xmath12 , the space @xmath53 of harmonic polynomials that vanish together with all their derivatives of order less than or equal to @xmath6 is dense in @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath54 , if @xmath55 and @xmath56 , if @xmath57 .",
    "we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath10 .",
    "fix a @xmath60 outside @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath61 is harmonic as a function of @xmath62 in a neighborhood of @xmath0 and in a neighborhood of the origin can be expanded in an absolutely convergent power series @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a multi - index @xmath65 and indices are allowed to run through all non - negative integers .",
    "let @xmath66 denote @xmath67 .",
    "further we notice that for any fixed non - negative integer @xmath68 , the polynomial @xmath69 is harmonic in @xmath62 and for any fixed @xmath64 , @xmath70 is harmonic in @xmath60 except at the origin and if we set @xmath71 where @xmath72 varies on the unit sphere , @xmath73 we note that @xmath74 is real - analytic on the unit sphere .",
    "now let @xmath75 clearly for any fixed @xmath76 , @xmath77 is harmonic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 and vanishes together with its derivatives of order less than or equal to @xmath6 .",
    "then if @xmath78 is any finite borel measure on @xmath2 orthogonal to @xmath79 , it follows that @xmath80 let @xmath81 denote @xmath82 and @xmath83 denote @xmath84 . by ( 1 )",
    "it follows that @xmath85 and @xmath86 is real - analytic on the unit sphere .",
    "we claim that @xmath87 suppose not .",
    "then there would exist a positive integer @xmath88 such that @xmath89 @xmath90 . because @xmath91 is homogeneous and is real - analytic ,",
    "the set of its zeroes on the unit sphere would be a closed set without any interior .",
    "hence there would exist sub - cone @xmath92 of @xmath26 and a positive number @xmath34 such that @xmath93 and further by choosing a sufficiently small @xmath94 , we have @xmath95 choose a hyper - plane section @xmath96 of @xmath97 through the origin and integrate @xmath98 on @xmath96 with respect to the surface measure on it . since @xmath98 stays away from @xmath1 on @xmath97 , it has the same sign everywhere and so from ( 4 ) it follows that @xmath99 but the last integral is infinite for @xmath100 .",
    "but on the other hand @xmath101 is uniformly bounded and so @xmath102 is finite .",
    "this , ( 5 ) , and ( 0 ) lead to a contradiction establishing ( 2 ) .",
    "hence @xmath103 if @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the dirac measure at the origin , ( 6 ) can be restated as @xmath106 ( 7 ) implies @xmath107 is orthogonal to any function @xmath4 which is the restriction to @xmath0 of a function harmonic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a rather standard runge argument and we omit the proof .",
    "hence for any @xmath4 in @xmath108 , @xmath109 and so @xmath110 .",
    "now by hahn ",
    "banach , we have theorem 3 .     fix a @xmath60 outside @xmath0 and write the taylor formula of order @xmath6 for the cauchy kernel : @xmath111 let @xmath78 be any finite borel measure on @xmath2 such that @xmath112 so @xmath113 and consequently @xmath114 let @xmath115 .",
    "arguing as in the proof of theorem 3 , we find that @xmath116 and @xmath117 is orthogonal to all functions holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 and so to @xmath118 .",
    "but @xmath105 is orthogonal to @xmath3 and hence follows the theorem .",
    "several problems remain .",
    "one of them is whether ecc is really necessary .",
    "another one is what is the capacity of the set of points where the conclusion of either theorem 3 or theorem 1 holds in analogy with the set of regular points for the dirichlet problem ?",
    "lastly , what would be an analogue of this theorem 1 in the context of several complex variables ?"
