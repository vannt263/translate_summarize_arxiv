    "to characterize how precisely the @xmath0 measurements are able to determine the parameter @xmath2 , we need something a bit more complicated than the obvious choice , the variance of the estimator , @xmath19 .",
    "the reason is that the variance does not take into account two important possibilities .",
    "first , even if the estimator has a small variance , it might be systematically biased away from the true parameter value  i.e . , @xmath20 might not equal @xmath2and thus give a poor estimate .",

    "we quantify the estimate s deviation from the parameter by @xcite @xmath21 the derivative @xmath22 removes the local difference in the `` units '' of the estimator and the parameter , and then the units - corrected estimator is compared to the parameter @xmath2 , not to the mean value of the estimator . as a statistical measure of the precision of the estimation , we use the second moment of @xmath23 .",
    "there is a lower bound on the second moment of @xmath23 : @xmath24 braunstein and caves @xcite derive the ultimate lower bound in two steps , in contrast to derivations by helstrom @xcite and holevo [ 5(chap .",
    "vi.2 ) ] , both of whom proceed to the ultimate lower bound in a single step that obscures the conditions for achieving the ultimate lower bound .",
    "the two steps in the braunstein - caves derivation are displayed as the two inequalities in eq .",

    "( [ bcbound ] ) , @xmath25 is the _ fisher information _ @xcite associated with the probability distribution @xmath15 .",
    "the first inequality is an expression of the cramr - rao bound of classical estimation theory @xcite , which places a lower bound on the variance of _ any _ estimator @xmath18 that is applied to data drawn from the distribution @xmath15 .",
    "an estimator that saturates the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound])and , hence , attains the cramr - rao bound  is called an _ efficient _ estimator .",
    "the lower bound in the first inequality can always be achieved asymptotically for large @xmath0 by using maximum - likelihood estimation @xcite , but except for special distributions , there is _ no _ efficient estimator for finite values of @xmath0 .    the second inequality in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) holds for any povm @xmath13 .",
    "the second inequality is written in terms of a line element @xmath26 , which defines a `` statistical distance '' @xcite that measures the distinguishability of neighboring quantum states and provides a natural riemannian geometry on the space of density operators . the explicit form that braunstein and caves @xcite ( see also [ 4,5(chap .",
    "vi.2 ) ] ) find for the line element is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a super - operator that , in the basis that diagonalizes @xmath29 , takes the form @xmath30 if @xmath29 has no zero eigenvalues , @xmath28 is the inverse of the super - operator defined by @xmath31 ; hence , @xmath28 was denoted @xmath32 by braunstein and caves @xcite .",
    "helstrom @xcite and holevo [ 5(chap .",
    "vi.2 ) ] call @xmath33 the `` symmetric logarithmic derivative '' of @xmath29 .",
    "the lower bound in the second inequality can be achieved by using a povm such that the operators @xmath34 are one - dimensional projection operators onto orthonormal eigenstates of the hermitian operator @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the conditions given here and above for achieving the two lower bounds in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) are sufficient , though they are not always necessary .",
    "the line element  ( [ statdistance ] ) on the space of density operators arises here from quantifying precisely the quantum restrictions on determining a parameter  and , hence , the quantum restrictions on the statistical distinguishability of neighboring density operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the same line element can also be gotten by defining a natural metric on density operators in terms of the correlation between pairs of conventional observables .",
    "the reader interested in this alternative route to the metric can find it spelled out in @xcite , together with references to related work .",
    "although not pointed out by braunstein and caves , the lower bound  ( [ bcbound ] ) does not improve if one allows measurements that do not factor into separate measurements on each of the @xmath0 replicas .",
    "one can see this by treating the @xmath0 replicas as a single composite system with density operator @xmath37 applied to this composite system , the bound  ( [ bcbound ] ) takes a form @xmath38 that holds for all quantum measurements on the product space of the composite system .",
    "it is not difficult to show , however , that for @xmath0-replica product states , the line element on the product space reduces to @xmath0 times the single - replica line element , i.e. , @xmath39 thus giving the same lower bound as in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) .",
    "this result provides a limited answer to a question raised by peres and wootters @xcite : when a composite system is made up of replicas all prepared in the same quantum state , can measurements on the composite system better distinguish states than can separate measurements on each of the replicas ? for the very special case of two neighboring states , the answer is no .",
    "we pause at this point to take stock of what has already been presented .",
    "the bound  ( [ bcbound ] ) , together with eq .",
    "( [ statdistance ] ) , is a general species of uncertainty relation , which restricts one s ability to determine a parameter from the results of quantum measurements .",
    "this uncertainty relation applies to mixed quantum states , allows for measurements that are not described by projection operators , and includes the possibility of multiple measurements . on the other hand , precisely because this uncertainty relation is so general , we find it instructive in what follows to specialize in three ways , thus permitting us to make closer contact with standard uncertainty relations .    for the first specialization",

    "we can write @xmath42 where we introduce @xmath43 as a shorthand for @xmath44 , and the line element  ( [ statdistance ] ) becomes @xmath45 notice that in this line element we can drop the restriction on the sum , since under any procedure for approaching the boundary on which one or more eigenvalues of @xmath29 vanishes , the terms for which @xmath46 do not contribute .    a consequence of the last inequality in eq .",

    "( [ statdistancetwo ] ) .",
    "equality is equivalent to the condition that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in particular , equality holds if @xmath29 is a pure state , but never holds if @xmath29 has no zero eigenvalues ( except in the trivial case @xmath52 ) .",
    "the second specialization is to assume that @xmath53 is a pure state .",
    "this assumption implies the first one , which is incorporated in eq .",
    "( [ rhoprimetwo ] ) , since a path on the pure states must be generated by a unitary transformation .",

    "one expects statistical distance , which measures the distinguishability of states , to be related to the inner product and thus to the hilbert - space angle between pure states .",
    "the square of the infinitesimal hilbert - space angle @xmath65 between neighboring states @xmath55 and @xmath66 is @xmath67 ^ 2= 1-|\\langle\\psi_x|\\psi_{x+dx}\\rangle|^2\\;. \\label{hangle}\\ ] ] the line element @xmath68 defines a natural riemannian metric , called the fubini - study metric @xcite , on the manifold of hilbert - space rays . using eq .",

    "the third and final specialization is to assume that the generator @xmath7 is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption allows us to integrate eq .",
    "( [ dpsi ] ) and to write the path on hilbert space as being generated by a single - parameter unitary operator , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a fiducial state at @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , this assumption guarantees that the expectation value of any function of @xmath7 is independent of @xmath2 ; thus we can drop the subscript @xmath2 from the mean and variance of @xmath7 . in particular , we can write the uncertainty relation  ( [ pureup1 ] ) as @xmath74 it is this parameter - based uncertainty relation that occupies us for the remainder of this paper . as noted above , this uncertainty relation resembles the standard uncertainty relation , except that the relation holds for multiple measurements and @xmath2 is a parameter , not necessarily corresponding to any hermitian operator .",
    "the chain of inequalities leading to the uncertainty relation  ( [ pureup ] ) consists of the two inequalities leading to the statistical distance in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) and the inequality involving the generator @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ statdistancetwo ] ) . the first inequality in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) can be saturated asymptotically for large @xmath0 by use of maximum - likelihood estimation , and the inequality in eq .",
    "( [ statdistancetwo ] ) is saturated for pure states .",
    "thus the question of achieving equality in the uncertainty relation  ( [ pureup ] ) , provided one allows for many measurements @xmath0 , reduces to finding an _ optimal measurement _ , i.e. , one that saturates the second inequality in eq .",
    "( [ bcbound ] ) .",
    "notice that since the variance of @xmath7 is constant as a consequence of our third assumption , optimal measurements lead to a maximum fisher information that is constant along the path .",

    "( [ deltahtwo ] ) ] .",
    "this measurement has the defect , however , that it generally depends on @xmath2 , thus requiring one to know the value of the parameter one is trying to estimate before choosing the optimal measurement .",

    "the povm @xmath76 must , of course , be complete , which means that @xmath78 the probability density for result @xmath77 , given the parameter @xmath2 , is @xmath79 as noted above , global optimal measurements lead to a fisher information  ( [ fisherinfo ] ) that is independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that we require that @xmath80 be a function only of @xmath81 , which means the povm must satisfy a `` displacement '' property @xmath82 measurements that satisfy properties  ( [ extwo ] ) and ( [ exthree ] ) are called _ covariant _ by holevo @xcite .",

    "this is not a surprising conclusion because the effect of a space - time translation is to shift the phase of each plane - wave field mode . indeed ,",

    "the aim of this paper is to show that this problem is only apparent .",
    "we eschew tedious discussions of the status of such quantities in quantum theory .",
    "instead we develop a formalism that allows us to derive quantum - mechanical limitations on the determination of such a quantity , without ever having to introduce an operator associated with the quantity , and we illustrate the formalism with numerous examples .    the formalism is founded on the idea that such a quantity should be treated as a parameter , to be determined from the results of measurements . to derive strict quantum - mechanical limits on such a determination",
    ", we must be able , first , to describe all measurements permitted by the rules of quantum mechanics  this is accomplished by using the formalism of povms  and , second , to set bounds on all possible ways of estimating the parameter from the results of the measurements  this is accomplished by appealing to the cramr - rao bound of classical parameter - estimation theory .",
    "the resulting quantum - mechanical limitations are expressed as mandelstam - tamm uncertainty relations involving the precision of the parameter estimation and variance of the operator that generates changes in the parameter .",
    "these uncertainty relations take into account naturally the expected improvement in determining the parameter as one is allowed to make measurements on an increasing number of identically prepared systems .",
    "moreover , we are able to derive general conditions for optimal measurements that can achieve the lower bound in the uncertainty relation , although it is generally not known how to perform such optimal measurements .",
