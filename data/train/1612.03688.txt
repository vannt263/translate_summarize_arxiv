    "it is supposed in most of the papers considering the relaxation processes in quantum optics that the spontaneous ( natural ) widths of the atomic levels are their intrinsic characteristics and are fixed @xcite . however , it was shown in several papers that these values can be controlled by means of a low - frequency driving field .",
    "some of the first theoretical predictions of this phenomenon were published in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "its detailed description was presented for a two - level atom .",
    "recently , the first experimental demonstration of the fluorescence spectral line elimination in a quantum system induced by the interfering transition amplitudes of the relaxing states was reported @xcite .    in the majority of papers",
    "the `` dressed '' states of a radiating two - level system exposed to a laser field are described within the framework of the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "this approximation proves to be valid in the case of rather weak atom - field interaction . in several papers",
    "the spontaneous emission was considered beyond rwa , however `` anti - rotating '' terms in the hamiltonian of the system were considered as small values and were taken into account in the framework of the perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to show that in the case of the strong field these terms lead to essential changes of the dipole matrix element of the two level atom and the parameters of its spontaneous emission .",
    "besides , we describe the method for calculating these parameters and analysing the spontaneous emission without the perturbation theory .",
    "our approach is based on the uniformly available approximation ( uaa ) for the states of a two - level atomic system in a single mode resonance quantum field that was found in the analytical form in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "uaa appeared to be valid in the whole range of the varying amplitude of the resonance field in such systems @xcite .",
    "it was shown in the paper @xcite and described later in @xcite that rwa applicability is defined not only by the atom - field coupling constant @xmath0 but also by the quantum number @xmath1 of the field according to inequality @xmath2 . in the case of zero detuning value",
    "this parameter coincides with rabi frequency @xmath3 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that uaa can also be used in the case of nonzero detuning value and rwa applicability is defined by the same parameter .",
    "thus , according to @xcite , the rwa is applicable if the following condition is fulfilled :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the frequency of the resonant field and @xmath3 is the rabi frequency of the two - level system .",
    "it is important to stress that the case @xmath6 can exist for real physical systems , and the transition from weak to strongly driven regime has been discovered experimentally @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamical control of the processes of the spontaneous emission in a two - level system becomes effective when the lifetime of the spontaneous decay is bigger than the period of rabi oscillations .",
    "this condition is defined by inequality @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the spontaneous emission linewidth of the two - level system ( here and below we adopt the system of units with @xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , for the characteristic parameters of the system ( @xmath10 ) there exists a range    @xmath11    where the counter - rotating terms in the two - level system hamiltonian should be included when calculating characteristics of the spontaneous emission and fluorescence spectra .",
    "this allows one to analyze the fluorescence spectra correctly and estimate the field parameters for the efficient control over the evolution of the system .",
    "analysis of the role of such `` corrections '' in the formation and control of the spontaneous emission spectra is the main goal of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in sec.[sec.2 ] the simple atomic model is considered as an example in order to illustrate qualitatively how one can use uaa instead of rwa for the description of the atomic `` dressed '' states . in sec.[sec.3 ] the non - rwa effects in the control of the spontaneous emission processes are analyzed for the same model . in sec.[sec.4 ]",
    "the real physical system is proposed which could allow one to observe these effects .",
    "analysis of evolution of the quantum systems in the resonant quantum field beyond the rwa is not widely spread .",
    "therefore , let us consider first of all rather simple illustrative model ( v - configuration three - level system , see fig.[fig.1 ] ) in order to make it clear how one can use uaa in this case .",
    "as it is known @xcite , the interaction between the atom and the vacuum electromagnetic field ( vef ) leads to the formation of a radiation width of quantum levels .",
    "this width is defined by the spontaneous emission and can be calculated via the quasi - stationary solution of the schrdinger equation :    @xmath12    for the three - level configuration ( fig.[fig.1 ] ) the total hamiltonian of the system in the nonrelativistic case is composed of the following operators :    @xmath13    @xmath14    we scale the energy system by the frequency of the external driving field so that @xmath15 could be used without the loss of generality .    here @xmath16 is the energy of the ground state ( in units of @xmath17 ) with its eigenstate @xmath18 .",
    "the energy splitting of the excited double - states @xmath19 with the energies @xmath20 is presented in the space of pauli matrices @xmath21 ; the coupling constant @xmath0 defines the resonant interaction between the atom and the external driving field , it is proportional to the dipole momentum of the transition between the excited double - states ; @xmath22 are the creation and annihilation operators of the quanta of the external single - mode field ; @xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of the vef photon with the wave vector @xmath24 , frequency @xmath25 and polarization @xmath26 ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the charge , mass and the momentum operator of the atomic electron correspongingly , @xmath29 is the normalization volume . in this system of units",
    "the rabi frequency corresponding to @xmath1-quantum state of the resonance field is defined as    @xmath30    in order to take into account the interaction between the atom and the driving resonant filed , let us define a new basis set for the excited states of the atom that are usually called the `` dressed states '' @xcite . in general case",
    "the `` dressed states '' are represented by the exact solutions of the equation :    @xmath31    thus , the two excited states of the `` bare '' atom are transformed to the spectra of states with the quasi - energies @xmath32 depending on the quantum number @xmath1 that corresponds to the number of photons in the driving field and the quantum number @xmath33 that corresponds to the eigenvalue of the parity operator commuting with the hamiltonian of the two - level system in the quantum field @xcite :    @xmath34 ) is obtained using rwa which leads to a simple analytical expression for the spectra of quasi - energies @xcite . however , according to @xcite rwa is applicable only for sufficiently small values @xmath35 .",
    "taking into account the range ( [ 2a ] ) , one can expect that the correction in the quasi - energies stipulated by the off - resonant terms in ( [ 6 ] ) might be comparable with the radiation linewidth of the excited states . to go beyond the rwa framework , an exact solution of eqns .",

    "the lifetime of the excited state is defined by the interaction between the atom and the vef mode inside the cavity that leads to the transition of the atom to the ground state accompanied by emitting a photon @xmath53 . for applications",

    "an estimation for radiation width valid for an arbitrary amplitude of the field was obtained in @xcite . however , in the present paper we carry out an analytical computation directly from equation ( [ 19 ] ) bounded by inequality ( [ 1 ] ) . in this case , the overlapping integral @xmath64 can be obtained in the form @xcite",
