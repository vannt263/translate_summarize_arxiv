    "the study of the spin dependent transport properties of ferromagnets is one of the most importrant subjects from both a fundamental and an application points of view . in a ferromagnetic metal ,",
    "the spin of a conduction electron interacts with the local magnetization through the exchange coupling , and this interaction strongly affects the electron charge dynamics .",
    "recently , an electromotive force of spin origin which is called a spin - motive force , has been theoretically predicted@xcite and experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "the spin - motive force reflects the conversion from the magnetic energy of a ferromagnet to the electric energy of electrons .",
    "the spin - motive force is essentially due to the exchange interaction between the electron spin and the local magnetization and provides a new concept of electric devices .    in this paper , we show that the origin of the spin - motive force is a misalignment between the electron spin and the local magnetization by using the equation - of - motion approach .",
    "we investigate a force acting upon an electron due to the exchange interaction , which accelerates electrons in the direction in which the exchange energy decreases .",
    "we derive the formula of the force , which is spin dependent .",
    "the spin dependent force consists of a driving force and a lorentz type force which contribute to the spin - motive force and the anomalous hall effect @xcite , respectively .",
    "the exsistence of such spin dependent forces has been argued in the past studies @xcite .",
    "however , our approach provides a more intutitive and physical understanding of the origin of the spin - motive force ; if a misalignment arises between the electron spin and the local magnetization , spatial inhomogenity of the electric potential energy appears due to the spatial inhomogenity of the exchange energy .",
    "as disccused above , in a ferromagnet the electron spin couples to the magnetization via the exchange interaction . we treat this interaction in the s - d hamiltonian given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the momentum operator , the electron mass , the exchange coupling energy and the pauli s matrices , respectively .",
    "the unit vector of the magnetization direction is represented by @xmath5 which has spatial and time dependence .    in order to examine the electron dynamics",
    ", we consider the equation of motion of the electron which is obtained by the heisenberg equation as @xmath6,\\mathcal{h}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\       & = & \\nabla_i\\left(j\\textrm{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}\\cdot\\textrm{\\boldmath $ m$}\\right ) \\label{gradient}\\nonumber\\\\       & = & \\left(\\nabla_ij\\right)\\textrm{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}\\cdot\\textrm{\\boldmath $ m$}+j\\nabla_i\\left(\\textrm{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}\\cdot\\textrm{\\boldmath $ m$}\\right ) , \\label{force1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the @xmath9-components ( @xmath10 ) of the position and `` force '' operators for the electron , respectively .",
    "the `` force '' is given by the spatial derivative of the exchange energy ; the electron is accelerated in the direction in which the potential energy @xmath11 decreases .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ force1 ] ) reflects the spatial inhomogenity of the exchange energy @xmath3 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) ] , while the second term comes from the spatial inhomogenity of @xmath12 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ] .",
    "hereafter , we consider the case in which the @xmath3 is constant and focus on the effects of the second term .",
    "the net force acting upon the electron is @xmath13 the expected value @xmath14 means @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the @xmath17 density matrix in the spin space , and @xmath18 is the unit vector of the electron spin direction .     due to the exchange coupling @xmath3 with the local magnetization @xmath5 .",
    ", width=188 ]    to calculate the force ( [ force2 ] ) , we have to determine the dynamics of the magnetization @xmath5 and the electron spin @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known that the magnetization @xmath5 obeys the phenomenological landau - lifshiz ( ll ) equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath22 the damping constant , and @xmath23 is the effective magnetic field which includes the external field , the exchange field due to the ferromagnetic coupling , and any other effects that are described in the free energy @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the saturation magnetization and the magnetic constant , respectively",
    ". once the explicit form of the free energy @xmath24 $ ] is given , the magnetization dynamics @xmath5 can be obtained by solving eq .",
    "( [ ll ] ) .    the remaining work is to determine the electron spin dynamics @xmath27 , which prefers to be parallel to the magnetization @xmath5 due to the strong exchange interaction between them .",
    "before concrete disccusions , let us make a point .",
    "in general , the electron spin @xmath27 is expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a unit vector perpendicular to @xmath5 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are coefficients ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the component @xmath33 does not contribute to the force ( [ force2 ] ) , because @xmath34 .",
    "in ohter words , if the electron spin is exactly parallel to the magnetization at every time and space , the electron s energy is the same always and everywhere , and the electron does not feel any force .",
    "this means that what causes the force is the off - diagonal component of the electron spin with respect to the magnetization , i.e. , the misalignment between them .",
    "according to the heisenberg equation , the equation of motion of the electron spin is @xmath35 this expression shows the larmor precession of the conduction electron spin around the magnetization .",
    "actually , in addition to the precession torque , the electron spin feels a damping torque to the magnetization . to obtain an analytical form of the electron spin dynamics without solving eq .",
    "( [ larmor ] ) in a straightforward manner , let us consider the problem in a more convenient coordinate system in which the magnetization is parallel to the @xmath36-axis at every time and space .",
    "such an operation is realized by a su(2 ) local gauge transformation @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are defined by @xmath41 , and @xmath42 is a two component spinor .    after performing the gauge transformation ,",
    "the hamiltonian in the rotational frame is @xmath43 where @xmath44 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the su(2 ) pure gauge fields , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , arise as a result of the gauge transformation .",

    "equation ( [ hamiltonian2 ] ) indicates that when the magnetization depends upon time , the electron spin feels the effective magnetic field @xmath49 in the rotating frame .",
    "therefore , in reality , the electron spin precesses around the effective magnetic field @xmath49 rather than the magnetization @xmath50 .",
    "if the magnetic texture is smooth and slow enough , we can adopt an adiabatic approximation in which @xmath27 is approximated to be parallel or antiparallel to the effective magnetic field at every time and space ; a normalized electron spin is @xmath51,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 stands for the majority ( minority ) spin with respect to the local magnetization and corresponds to @xmath53(@xmath54 ) in the right - hand side . here , we replace @xmath55 by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the averaged velocity vector of electrons . the expression for @xmath27 in the laboratory frame is obtained by the @xmath58 rotation as @xmath59\\left\\langle\\textrm{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$ } \\right\\rangle _ { \\uparrow\\downarrow}'\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\pm \\left(\\textrm{\\boldmath $ m$}+\\textrm{\\boldmath $ d$}/j\\right ) .",

    "as an example , we demonstrate a numerical calculation of the spin - motive force due to the field induced domain wall motion in a ferromagnetic thin wire .",
