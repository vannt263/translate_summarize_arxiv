    "<S> recent phenomenological work has examined two different ways of including charge symmetry violation in parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> first , a global phenomenological fit to high energy data has included charge symmetry breaking terms , leading to limits on the magnitude of parton charge symmetry breaking . in a second approach </S>",
    "<S> , two groups have included the coupling of partons to photons in the qcd evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> one possible experiment that could search for isospin violation in parton distributions is a measurement of the asymmetry in w production at a collider . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we include both of the postulated sources of parton charge symmetry violation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , given charge symmetry violation of a magnitude consistent with existing high energy data , the expected w production asymmetries would be quite small , generally less than one percent .    </S>",
    "<S> charge symmetry represents a specific form of isospin invariance ( a rotation of @xmath0 about the `` 2 '' axis in isospin space ) that is quite well respected at low energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since there is no direct experimental evidence of charge symmetry violation ( csv ) for pdfs @xcite , it was reasonable , at least in the beginning , to assume that it held as well for parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we know that small violations of charge symmetry do arise from both the mass differences of light current quarks , and from electromagnetic effects . there have been some theoretical estimates of charge symmetry violation in pdfs , and recently charge symmetry violation has been included in phenomenological pdfs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the estimated size of the csv is such that it can produce important effects in some experiments , for example in precise tests of physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> global fits of pdfs by martin , roberts , stirling and thorne ( mrst )  @xcite included the possibility of charge symmetry violating pdfs for valence and sea quarks . by construction </S>",
    "<S> , the resulting parton distributions will agree with the array of experimental data used in global fits . </S>",
    "<S> the valence quark csv pdfs were chosen to have the specific form u_(x ) & = & - d_(x ) = ( 1-x)^4 x^-0.5 ( x - .0909 ) + u_(x ) & = & u_^p(x ) - d_^n(x )  ; d_(x ) = d_^p(x ) - u_^n(x ) + [ eq : csvmrst ] at both small and large @xmath1 the valence quark csv term is qualitatively similar to phenomenological valence quark distributions @xcite , and the first moment of the valence csv distribution is zero , a necessary condition to preserve valence quark normalization . </S>",
    "<S> the single coefficient @xmath2 was varied in the global fit to high energy data . to minimize the resulting computing time </S>",
    "<S> , mrst neglected the @xmath3 dependence of this csv effect . </S>",
    "<S> the best value they obtained was @xmath4 , and the 90% confidence level included the range @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that for the best fit obtained by mrst , the valence quark csv distributions are in very good agreement both in sign and magnitude with predictions from quark model calculations  @xcite  see also the model independent constraint on the second moment obtained in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in a separate global fit to the same data , mrst included the possibility of sea quark csv effects . </S>",
    "<S> the mrst functional form chosen for sea quark csv was |u^n(x ) & = & |d^p(x ) +    total momentum carried by antiquarks in the neutron and proton was approximately equal . </S>",
    "<S> once again , they assumed no @xmath3 dependence for these csv distributions.the best fit was obtained for @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> an alternative , phenomenological approach to the problem of charge symmetry violation associated with the electromagnetic interaction has been proposed by both mrst @xcite and glueck , jimenez - delgado and reya @xcite . by analogy with the usual qcd evolution involving gluon radiation , these authors suggested that one assume charge symmetry at some initial low - mass scale , and include in the evolution equations the effect of photon radiation . </S>",
    "<S> when one includes qed contributions in this way , to lowest order in both the strong coupling @xmath7 and the em coupling @xmath8 , the so - called dglap evolution equations due to dokshitzer @xcite , gribov and lipatov @xcite and altarelli and parisi @xcite are modified . the mrst group obtains & = & _ 2 + & + & 2  , + g ( x,^2 ) ^2 & = & _ 2  , + ( x,^2 ) ^2 & = & 2  . </S>",
    "<S> + [ eq : qedevol ] in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] , the right hand side of the schematic evolution equations represents a convolution of the splitting functions with the quark and gluon distributions ( which have an explicit dependence on the factorization scale parameter @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the electromagnetic contribution to qcd evolution introduces a `` photon parton distribution '' @xmath10 which is coupled to the quark and gluon distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the new splitting functions that occur in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] are related to the standard qcd splitting functions by _ qq & = & p_qq / c_f ; p_q = p_gq / c_f + p_q & = & p_qg / t_r ; p _ </S>",
    "<S> = -23_i e_i^2 ( 1-y ) [ eq : split ] conservation of momentum is assured by the relation _ 0 </S>",
    "<S> ^ 1 dx x = 1 [ eq : momcons ]    it is necessary to simplify eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] . </S>",
    "<S> first , since the em interaction is not asymptotically free , it is not clear how to set the starting values for the various pdfs that are coupled by these qed effects . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is not clear where the qed effects should be assumed to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> second , inclusion of the qed couplings could in principle more than double the number of parton distribution functions ( one must now differentiate between proton and neutron pdfs , in addition to the new photon parton distributions ) . </S>",
    "<S> two groups have adopted somewhat different strategies , with similar overall results . </S>",
    "<S> glueck  @xcite point out that the photon parton distribution is already of order @xmath8 , as is clear by inspection of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] . </S>",
    "<S> consequently to leading order in @xmath8 they drop terms involving @xmath10 from the right - hand side of eq .  [ eq : qedevol ] . </S>",
    "<S> when they adopt the standard convention for dis reactions of setting the scale @xmath11 , glueck  then obtain convolution equations for the charge symmetry violating valence quark distributions arising from qed coupling , & & d d lnq^2u_(x , q^2 ) = 2 _ x^1 dyy p(xy ) u_(y , q^2 ) + & & d d lnq^2d_(x , q^2 ) = -2 _ x^1 dyy p(xy ) d_(y , q^2 ) + & & p(z ) = ( e_u^2 - e_d^2 ) p_qq(z ) = ( e_u^2 - e_d^2 ) ( 1+z^2 1-z ) _ + [ eq : gluevol ] similar relations hold for the antiquark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> glueck  assume that the average current quark mass @xmath12 , taken as 10 mev , is the kinematical lower bound for a photon emitted by a quark . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to taking the electron mass as the lower limit for radiation of photons in the earliest calculations of the lamb shift ( before the advent of renormalization group arguments ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  [ eq : gluevol ] is then integrated from @xmath13 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the rationale here is to evaluate qed evolution effects while keeping the qcd effects fixed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quark distributions appearing on the right hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : gluevol ] are taken from the grv leading - order parton distributions @xcite . in the resulting integrals , in the region @xmath14 gev@xmath15 corresponding to momentum transfers below the input scale for grv , </S>",
    "<S> the pdfs are `` frozen , '' in this region they are assumed to be equal to their value at the input scale @xmath16 .     </S>",
    "<S> ( solid curve ) and minority @xmath17 ( dashed curve ) valence parton distributions obtained by glueck   at @xmath18 gev@xmath15 , assuming qed evolution from a scale set by the current quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> these are compared with majority ( solid points ) and minority ( open circles ) csv distributions obtained from theoretical bag model calculations . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : glueck],width=316 ]    the resulting valence isospin asymmetries @xmath19 and @xmath17 are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : glueck ] at @xmath18 gev@xmath15 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> they are plotted along with the valence quark isospin asymmetries obtained by rodionov  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter csv distributions were obtained from bag model calculations , where charge symmetry violation was assumed to arise from mass differences of the residual diquarks @xmath20 and from the target nucleon mass difference @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath22 was taken as 4 mev @xcite , which includes an estimate of the em contribution to this mass difference . while the quantity @xmath23 is quite similar in both sign and magnitude for both the bag model and the qed calculations , the qed results for @xmath24 are roughly half as large as the bag model results . </S>",
    "<S> as noted previously , the bag model results for valence quark csv are extremely close to those obtained by mrst using the phenomenological form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : csvmrst ] , for the best - fit value @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mrst group @xcite solves the evolution equations of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] with assumptions about the parton distributions at the starting scale @xmath25 gev@xmath15 . at the starting scale , the sea quark and gluon distributions </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to be isospin symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the starting photon parton distributions are taken as those due to one - photon radiation from valence quarks in leading - logarithm approximation , evolved from current quark masses @xmath26 mev and @xmath27 mev to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this produces different photon pdfs for neutron and proton at the starting scale . enforcing overall quark momentum conservation from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : momcons ] requires valence quark isospin asymmetry at the starting scale . </S>",
    "<S> mrst assume that this takes the form d_^n - u_^p = 2(d_^p - u_^n ) = ( u_^p - 2d_^p )  . </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : epsdef ] eq .  [ eq : epsdef ] is a simple phenomenological form chosen to obey the valence quark normalization condition , and it produces isospin violating distributions that resemble the valence pdfs at large and small @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath29 is determined from the overall quark momentum conservation condition .    </S>",
    "<S> having determined the starting distributions for the photon parton distribution , and the asymmetry parameter @xmath29 , the proton s quark and gluon distributions at the starting scale @xmath30 are determined in the same way as for other mrst global fits . </S>",
    "<S> the only change is that separate dglap evolution equations are used for partons in the neutron and proton .    </S>",
    "<S> if we adopt the mrst functional form for charge symmetry violating pdfs , we can estimate the magnitude of effects one might expect in a dedicated experiment designed to test parton charge symmetry . in a recent paper @xcite , we estimated the magnitude of effects in two promising experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the first was a comparison of drell - yan cross sections induced by charged pions on an isoscalar target ( the deuteron ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second experiment involved semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering involving charged pion production in @xmath31 interactions .    in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we consider another possible experimental test of parton charge symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this involves measurements of @xmath32 production at hadron colliders , specifically @xmath32-boson production in high energy @xmath33 collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this was initially suggested by vigdor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> boros  made estimates of the effects that might be expected at colliders such as rhic and lhc @xcite , and concluded that one might expect several percent effects in certain observables . </S>",
    "<S> however , these effects occurred because the authors had assumed very large charge symmetry violation in the parton sea . </S>",
    "<S> this large sea quark csv was necessary to account for significant discrepancies between the @xmath34 structure functions extracted from high energy @xmath35 interactions measured by the nmc collaboration @xcite , and the @xmath34 from @xmath36 dis measured by ccfr @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , these discrepancies disappeared when the neutrino reactions were re - analyzed  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there were two reasons for significant changes of @xmath37 upon re - analysis . </S>",
    "<S> first , experimental neutrino cross - sections measure a combination of @xmath34 and @xmath38 . in the initial analysis </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath38 was calculated from phenomenological pdfs . in the re - analysis </S>",
    "<S> , this quantity was extracted from experiment , by using the fact that the two structure functions have different @xmath39 dependences in the cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath38 that was extracted differed considerably from the phenomenological @xmath38 , and this subsequently changed the value of @xmath34 that was extracted . </S>",
    "<S> the second significant change arose through the use of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) equations for charm quark mass effects  @xcite , rather than the `` slow re - scaling '' model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the mrst analysis found evidence for sea quark csv @xcite , it was considerably smaller than that extracted from the original data , including the slow re - scaling contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections for the processes @xmath40 and @xmath41 have the form & & dd(pd w^+ x ) ~+ + & & + & & dd(pd w^- x ) ~+ + & & + [ eq : dsigdxf ]    in the absence of csv terms , if we take the sum of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 cross sections , ( ) ( dd)^w^+ + ( dd)^w^-  , [ eq : sigmass ] then the cabibbo favored terms in @xmath44 are invariant under the exchange @xmath45 , or alternatively under the transformation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we define the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath48 as a ( ) = _ ( ) - _ ( - ) _ ( ) + _ ( - ) [ eq : axf ] the only terms remaining in the quantity @xmath48 are charge symmetry violating terms , plus terms containing strange quarks in the cabibbo - unfavored sector .    we have calculated the effects to be expected for the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath48 for @xmath32-production at a hadron collider , using the charge symmetry violating pdfs calculated by the mrst group . </S>",
    "<S> we have used pdfs corresponding to three different sources of charge symmetry violation . </S>",
    "<S> first , we used the valence quark and sea quark csv pdfs extracted by the mrst group from global fits to high energy data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then we have added the csv pdfs calculated by the mrst group by including the `` qed '' contributions to qcd evolution , with assumptions about the parton distributions at the starting scale @xmath25 gev@xmath15 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the various csv pdfs were extracted using different procedures . </S>",
    "<S> the valence and sea quark pdfs were calculated in independent global fits to high energy data . in these fits , </S>",
    "<S> one assumed a particular functional form for the valence ( or sea ) quark csv pdfs , which depended upon an overall variable parameter for the strength . that parameter was determined by minimizing the @xmath49 of the global fit . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity mrst neglected the @xmath3 dependence of the csv distributions .    in these various global fits , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains different valence parton distributions in the minimization process ( the sea quark and gluon distributions were essentially identical to those obtained assuming charge symmetry ) . </S>",
    "<S> so the best fit valence quark pdfs obtained by mrst when they allowed valence quark csv differed somewhat from those obtained when they allowed sea quark csv . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the mrst global fits that allowed parton csv did not explicitly include the `` qed '' contributions to qcd evolution . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the various contributions to the @xmath32 production asymmetry , despite some questions regarding the consistency in the different parton distributions that give rise to csv effects .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : afig ] , we plot the forward - backward asymmetry expected for @xmath32 production , as defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : axf ] . </S>",
    "<S> the parton distribution functions are obtained from the mrst analysis that includes the `` qed '' contribution to dglap evolution ; this analysis includes electromagnetic couplings in the evolution equations that give rise to isospin violation @xcite , as given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : qedevol ] . </S>",
    "<S> the input data for these global fits was that used in the mrst2004 analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the top figure is calculated for @xmath50 gev , and the bottom figure is calculated for @xmath51 gev . </S>",
    "<S> all three curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : afig ] include the sea quark csv terms from eq .  </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : csvmrst ] . in each graph </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : afig],title=\"fig:\",width=316 ]    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : afig ] shows that the sea quark csv and the qed isospin violation tend to produce negative forward - backward @xmath32 asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions from valence quark csv , with magnitudes at the 90% confidence level extracted by mrst , contribute a roughly equal magnitude to the asymmetries produced by the other sources of csv . </S>",
    "<S> for negative values of @xmath2 , which agree with theoretical estimates of valence quark csv @xcite , the valence csv terms tend to cancel the asymmetry produced by sea quark csv ; while for positive values of @xmath2 the various sources of isospin violation tend to add . </S>",
    "<S> note that the predicted forward - backward asymmetries are quite small . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude is less than @xmath57 for almost all values of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are considerably smaller than those obtained by boros  @xcite , who predicted rather large positive values for @xmath48 , as large as @xmath58 for @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reasons for this difference . </S>",
    "<S> first , the sea quark csv terms are substantially smaller for mrst than those extracted by boros , by a factor of five or six ; the sea quark csv terms obtained by mrst and boros also have opposite signs . </S>",
    "<S> second , with the very large values of sea quark csv extracted by boros , the cabibbo unfavored terms were negligible . </S>",
    "<S> however , with the much smaller sea quark csv obtained by mrst , the cabibbo unfavored terms can no longer be neglected , and they tend to cancel the cabibbo favored contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> this calculation of the forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath32 production finds that the expected effects are quite small , generally less than one percent for the range of csv effects obtained by mrst . with the expected levels of isospin violation in pdfs </S>",
    "<S> , it will be necessary to measure these asymmetries to better than one percent if this observable is to provide a test for charge symmetry violation in parton distributions . </S>"
