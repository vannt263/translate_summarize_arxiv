    "the integration of single - layer and few - layers transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) into nanoelectronics  @xcite is paving the way for future developments of low power , ultrathin electronic devices  @xcite . the versatile chemical composition and phase stability of tmds results in a wide range of electronic properties from metallic to wide band gap semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the two dimensional nature of tmds enables its hybridization and integration with various materials via intercalation  @xcite , doping  @xcite , heterostructure  @xcite and interfaces  @xcite .",
    "although the majority of efforts so far have been devoted to tmd - based transistors  @xcite , tmds are rapidly finding other applications including metallic interconnects  @xcite ( see also cu - graphene hybrids  @xcite ) , non - volatile memory devices  @xcite and electro / mechanical switches have been predicted from theory  @xcite .",
    "an important limitation of tmd - based electronics lies in the poor hybridization between metals and tmds resulting in high interface resistance  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in addition to the inherent schottky barrier at the metal / semiconductor interface , a tunneling barrier arise from the van der waals ( vdw ) nature of the metal - tmd interaction .",
    "moreover , the vdw interaction between multiple layers of tmds also limits carrier injection at the interface with the metal contact .",
    "various metals have been investigated in order to improve contacts  @xcite as well as local tmd processing such as intercalation , phase engineering  @xcite and chemical doping  @xcite .",
    "due of the wide compositional flexibility of tmds and the various metals of interest , brute force experimental optimizations are likely to be ineffective and predictive computational techniques can help narrow down experimental studies to the most promising candidates .",
    "electronic structure calculations using density functional theory ( dft ) , including corrections for the nonlocal dispersive forces part of vdw interactions  @xcite , have played and continue to play a key role in this field  @xcite .",
    "however , the computational intensity of dft calculations has limited its application to relatively small size , model systems composed of few hundreds of atoms .",
    "thus , most of the dft studies have focused on defect free tmd / metal interfaces ( limited by the small size of the supercell ) and little is known about the nanostructure of the interface .    direct synthesis of single to few layers tmds have been demonstrated however , even with sophisticated chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) techniques  @xcite , tmds present high defect density  @xcite . understanding defect formation in tmds would not only enable the synthesis of large area , defect - free layers but would also provide the knowledge for defect - controlled tmd growth .",
    "structural defects in tmds , including point defects and grain boundary influence its electronic , thermal and mechanical properties  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the atomistic mechanisms of nucleation and growth during the cvd process remain unclear .",
    "large - scale atomistic simulations would be critical to study the interactions between defects and interfaces and to provide atomistic insight into the process of synthesis and growth of these materials .",
    "this paper contributes to bridge the gap between first principle calculations and experiments via the development of the first reactive force field capable of describing a tmd , a metal and their interactions , specifically molybdenum ditelluride and cu .",
    "we use the reaxff formalism that has shown the flexibility to describe a wide range of materials including metals , semiconductors , their oxides  @xcite and molecular materials  @xcite .",
    "the force field is parameterized to describe various phases of cu , mo and mote@xmath0 as well as the corresponding interfaces , the intercalation of cu atoms and small clusters in the vdw gap of multiple layers of mote@xmath0 including a proper description of the relative energies , charges and mechanical properties .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : method ] we present details about the simulations and methods .",
    "section [ sec : reaxff ] describes the optimized force field and presents its comparison with dft calculations . in sections",
    "[ sec : app1 ] and [ sec : app2 ] we study the interface between monolayer mote@xmath0 and a copper slab and the dynamics of cu - intercalated mote@xmath0 under various external voltages , respectively .",
    "we finally draw conclusions in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "reaxff is a bond order interatomic potential and naturally allows bond breaking and forming during molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations  @xcite .",
    "the total energy is defined as the sum of various contributions including covalent ( bond stretch , angles , torsions , and over / under coordination ) and non - bonded interactions ( van der waals and coulomb ) ; additional terms to account for lone pair and bond conjugation .",
    "electrostatic interactions are described using environment - dependent partial atomic charges which are computed at each step of the simulation using the charge equilibration method  @xcite ( qeq ) .",
    "all contributions to the covalent energy depend on the partial bond order between atoms , a function that smoothly decays to zero when the bond between atoms is broken .",
    "details on the mathematical form of reaxff can be found in the original paper , ref .",
    "@xcite and a recent review of applications in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to determine the parameters that describe the functional form of the interaction , the force field has to be optimized against a training set consisting of first principle calculations or a combination between first principles calculations and experiments .",
    "the parameterization of such a force field is complex due to the large number of parameters and the need for extensive training sets and time - consuming optimization cycles .",
    "thus , despite the enormous progress to date  @xcite , several materials of technological importance lack accurate force field descriptions .",
    "all dft calculations have been performed with the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite within the generalized gradient approximation as proposed by perdew , burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe )  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we use the non - local vdw density functional of langreth and lundqvist  @xcite ( vdw - df ) throughout the paper to correct for the london dispersion , poorly described by pbe functionals .",
    "atomic structures have been relaxed until energies and forces reach a tolerance of 1@xmath310@xmath4 ev and 1@xmath310@xmath5 ev /  , respectively .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff for the plane - wave basis was set to 500 ev and we integrate the k - mesh with various number of points depending on the size of the supercell .",
    "we use a dense 8@xmath38@xmath38 k - mesh for bulk cu and mo , an intermediate 4@xmath34@xmath32 grid for bulk mote@xmath0 and cu - intercalated mote@xmath0 and gamma point calculations have been performed on large cells used to compute cu mobility .",
    "we verified that the kinetic energy cutoff chosen provides well converged structures with respect to energy , force and stress .",
    "diffusion of cu ions in the vdw gap of mote@xmath0 and minimum energy path between h @xmath6 t phases of mote@xmath0 have been computed using the nudged elastic band  @xcite ( neb ) method , as implemented in vasp .",
    "additionally , we performed _",
    "ab initio _",
    "md simulations at 500 k with a kinetic energy cutoff of 300 ev and timestep of 1.5 fs in order to overcome the energy barrier corresponding to the dissociation of a cu@xmath7 cluster intercalated in mote@xmath0 .      in order to optimize the force field",
    "we use an in - house code written in python that implements a monte carlo - based ( mc ) simulated annealing algorithm  @xcite and coupled to the lammps simulator  @xcite ( via its python interface ) to evaluate energies , forces , pressures and charges of molecules and crystals included in the training set .",
    "this method has been used previously to optimize force fields for oxides  @xcite and metals  @xcite .",
    "the training set is included as an xml database of dft calculations describing the dissociation of small molecules and equation of states for crystals .",
    "the goal of the simulated annealing optimization is to minimize a total error function ( @xmath8 ) defined as the sum of individual discrepancies between the force field and dft data , corresponding to energy ( e ) , force ( f ) , pressure ( p ) and charge ( q ) as :    @xmath9    with @xmath10 a set of normalization constants chosen such that each individual error appears with equivalent weight ; these parameters are also used to establish the relative importance between different quantities in the training set .    before starting the simulated annealing run we perform an initial sensitivity analysis for each parameter in the force field in order to determine the steps by which each parameter will be stochastically modified during the mc run .",
    "a metropolis criterion allows the random selection of some `` non - optimum '' parameters in order to expand the exploration space and avoid the force field function becoming trapped in local minima .",
    "the _ temperature _ used for the metropolis acceptance is decreased during the simulation in order to converge towards the global minimum .",
    "we note that the qeq parameters are optimized first in order to reproduce partial atomic charges of the structures in the training set obtained from bader analysis  @xcite of the dft runs .",
    "this is done by setting @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 to zero in the energy expression so that only partial charges are compared .",
    "the simulated annealing code distributes md simulations in parralel ( using ipython for parallel computing ) and at its current stage of development can perform 1,000 single point calculations in approximatively 5 seconds over 64 cores .",
    "mote@xmath0 has recently received significant attention because of the discovery of a metallic t phase  @xcite energetically close  @xcite to its ground state semiconducting h phase , common to group vi tmds .",
    "therefore , we decided to develop parameters for mote@xmath0 rather than the more studied molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) , already explored by md  @xcite .",
    "copper is the metal of choice for electrodes and metallic interconnects ; hence , we studied the system cu - mote@xmath0 .",
    "the following subsections describe the training data used in the force field parameterization and compare the optimized reaxff with the dft training data .",
    "we built an initial force field with parameters for mo and te extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite and cu from ref .",
    "the general parameters were re - optimized in order to improve the atomic features including equation of state and formation energy , as described in details in the following sections .",
    "therefore , the parameters presented here are not transferable to the initial reaxff they belong to and the new force field we propose corresponds to a new branch of the reaxff tree , as defined in ref .",
    "additionally , we introduce three anglar terms corresponding to te - mo - te , te - cu - te and cu - te - cu in order to describe the subtle energy difference between mote@xmath0 phases and the potential energy landscape of cu diffusion in mote@xmath0 .",
    "we first optimized the qeq parameters , traditionally named @xmath14 and @xmath15 representing the shielding distance for coulomb interactions , electronegativity and hardness parameters , respectively .",
    "partial atomic charges were optimized on each atom against bader charges .",
    "we show in table [ tab : tab1 ] the root mean square error of charges per atom computed between the optimized reaxff and dft .",
    "reaxff describes accurately charges with an average error of 0.037 @xmath16 0.015 @xmath17 per atom compared to bader charges .",
    "a key feature of reaxff lies in its ability to describe atoms in various chemical environments , corresponding to different coordinations .",
    "therefore , we fit reaxff against various bulk phases of cu and mo including simple cubic ( sc ) , face centered cubic ( fcc ) and body centered cubic ( bcc ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows various equations of state ( eos ) computed with dft and reaxff , with minimum energy shifted to their corresponding enthalpies of formation ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] for details ) . for both mo and cu ,",
    "reaxff describes with accuracy the ground state structures , only the simple cubic phases present some discrepancy with respect to dft .",
    "however , the simple cubic phases lie tens of kcal / mol higher than the ground state and therefore do not represent important contribution to their chemistry ; it is only important that they remain energetically prohibited .",
    "( a ) ( b )    mote@xmath0 has been observed in the stable h and t phases as well as a metastable t phase , corresponding to trigonal prismatic , distorted octahedral and octahedral geometries , respectively .",
    "the semiconducting h phase has been shown to be the ground state configuration for mo - based tmds while the metallic t phase lies few mev above the h for mote@xmath0 .",
    "a transition from h to t has been predicted from dft calculations by mechanical strain in the range of 0.3 to 3%  @xcite or an applied electrostatic gate voltage  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the eos corresponding to various phases of bulk mote@xmath0 computed with dft and reaxff , and shifted to their binding energy .",
    "the binding energy is defined as the total energy of the mote@xmath0 phase minus the total energies of bulk mo in its ground state bcc phase and the diatomic molecule te@xmath0 .",
    "the force field predicts the h phase to be the ground state however , the t phase appears higher than the t phase .",
    "additionally , we computed the potential energy surface corresponding to transition between h@xmath6t within the rectangular unit cell constrained to the initial h phase , as depicted in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we found that reaxff predicts the energy barrier between h and t phases e@xmath18=32.3 kcal / mol in good agreement compared to 35.7 kcal / mol computed from dft calculations .",
    "we note that reaxff is able to capture subtle energy differences between the various phases of mote@xmath0 .     computed with vdw - df ( left ) and reaxff ( right ) as a function of the volume of the unit cell .",

    "therefore , the training set includes various bond dissociation curves , such as te - te and mo - te bonds in te@xmath0 molecule and monolayer mote@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding energies versus bond distance plots are shown in figure [ fig : fig4 ] .",

    "we found little drift in the total energy ( @xmath20 1@xmath310@xmath21 kcal / mol / ps / atom ) suggesting a good stability of the force field .",
