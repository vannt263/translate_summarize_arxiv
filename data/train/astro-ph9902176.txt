    "the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ allows the derivation of color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) which extend to almost the faintest visible stars , just above the hydrogen - burning limit for the nearest clusters ( king  1998 ) .",
    "these cmds can be used to extract luminosity functions ( lfs ) , and from them mass functions ( mfs ) which extend over almost the entire mass range of the luminous gc stars , from the turnoff ( to ) down to the bottom of the main sequence ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the gc mfs are important as they can provide important observational inputs in a variety of astrophysical problems , like the realistic dynamical modeling of individual clusters ( king , sosin , and cool 1995 , sosin 1997 ) , and the role of dynamical evolution in modifying the gc stellar content ( piotto , cool , and king 1997 , pck ) . in principle",
    ", gc mfs also give information about the amount of mass contained in very - low - mass stars and brown dwarf stars in globulars , and , by extension , in the galactic halo .",
    "the observed mfs are related to the gc initial mfs ( imfs ) : a basic input parameter for any gc and galaxy formation model .",
    "progress on these issues requires accurate photometry of main sequence ( ms ) stars . in many cases",
    ", the hst data alone can not provide all the information .",
    "the brightest ms stars in the closest gcs are always badly saturated in deep wfpc2/hst frames , and often there are no short exposures in the same field , as we tend to use hst to measure the faintest objects .",
    "this lack of information might become a dangerous drawback when comparing the stellar lf of different clusters , as discussed in cool , piotto , and king ( 1996 , cpk ) .",
    "in fact , the shape of the lf for stars fainter than @xmath4 is dominated by the slope of the mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) more than by the shape of the mf .",
    "ground - based data might become of great importance in this respect .",
    "here we present the first deep hst cmds and lfs for m10 ( ngc  6254 ) and m55 ( ngc  6809 ) , and an independent determination of the cmd and the lf of m22 ( ngc  6656 ) . a cmd and a lf of m22",
    "have already been presented by de marchi and paresce ( 1997 ) , based on the same images .",
    "for all three clusters , the cmds and lfs have been extended to the to and above , by means of ground - based data .",
    "we compare the results for m22 with the lf of de marchi and paresce ( 1997 ) , and then compare the lfs for the three clusters with each other . a comparison with the presently available hst lfs and mfs for intermediate and metal - poor clusters is also presented .",
    "this paper is a continuation and an extension of the paper by pck .    a description of the observations and of the data analysis is presented in section  [ dataset ] .",
    "the cmds and lfs are presented in sections [ cmd ] and [ lf ] .",
    "the mf is derived in section  [ mf ] .",
    "a comparison of the presently available lfs extended to the to is shown in section  [ comp ] , and a discussion follows in section  [ disc ] .    .data set [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ comp3v ] ( @xmath0 lfs ) and fig",
    ".  [ comp3i ] ( @xmath1 lfs ) .",
    "the adopted apparent distance moduli and reddenings are given in table  [ distance ] ( baraffe  rows ) . in the absence of a means of normalizing the three lfs to a global cluster parameter",
    ", arbitrary constants determine the vertical positioning of the individual lfs .",
    "we have chosen these constants exactly as described in pck . briefly , vertical shift of the m10 , m22 , and m55 lfs were made to bring them into alignment , according to a least - square algorithm , in the magnitude intervals @xmath5 and @xmath6 . the overall trend of the lfs in fig .  [ comp3v ] and fig .",
    "[ comp3i ] is similar , with a steep rise up to @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , followed by a drop to the limiting magnitude of the present investigation . indeed , both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lfs for m10 reach their maximum at magnitudes @xmath9 fainter than in m55 and m22 .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the fact that m10 is slightly more metal rich than the other two clusters ( dantona and mazzitelli , 1995 ) .    despite the fact that the overall shape of the lf of m10 is similar to the others , a close inspection of figs .",
    "[ comp3v ] and [ comp3i ] reveals that it is significantly steeper than the other two lfs .",
    "this difference can hardly be due to any internal dynamical evolution , if we consider that the three clusters have similar internal structures . even if we did not fully trust the dynamical models ( both king - michie models and n - body simulations , vesperini and heggie 1997 ) , which predict that our local lfs for m10 , m22 , and m55 closely resemble the global ones , it is noteworthy that the m10 field is at an intermediate position in terms of half - light radius @xmath10 , between the m55 and the m22 fields .",
    "therefore , the differences in lf slopes can not be due to mass segregation .",
    "the lfs can be transformed into mfs using a mlr .",
    "as emphasized in section  [ cmd ] , such transformations are still uncertain for low - mass , low - metallicity stars , and we must rely on the models almost entirely .",
    "it is somehow reassuring that not only at least two of the existing models are able to reproduce the observed diagrams , but also the distance moduli and reddenings that result from the fit are in agreement , within the errors , with the values in the literature .",
    "this does not mean that the models by the lyon and the teramo groups used in section  [ cmd ] are the _ correct _ ones .",
    "they are simply the best ones presently available , and we will use both of them to gather some information on the general shape of the mfs of m10 , m15 , and m22 . the cautionary remarks on the absence of empirical mlr data should still be heeded . for the sake of comparison , and in order to give an idea of the possible range of uncertainty , we will also use the mlr of the roma group ( dantona and mazzitelli 1995 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ mfi ] we compare the mfs derived from the @xmath1 lfs of m10 , m22 , and m55 from the to down to @xmath11 .",
    "an arbitrary vertical shift is applied for reasons of clarity .",
    "the adopted distance moduli , reddenings , and metallicities for the mfs obtained using the lyon and teramo models are in table  [ distance ] . for the roma model we adopted the values in djorgovski ( 1993 ) and used the isochrone corresponding to 10 gyr .",
    "the mfs obtained using the lyon and teramo models track one other closely for @xmath12 .",
    "the small differences for higher masses might be due , at least in part , to the difference in the adopted ages .",
    "the mfs from the roma models are systematically steeper , as already noted in pck .",
    "[ mfvi ] compares the mfs obtained from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lfs , using the teramo models . in all cases ,",
    "the two mfs are very similar , despite the fact that the two lfs have been independently obtained .",
    "this result is also reassuring on the theoretical side , showing the internal consistency of the models .    in all cases ,",
    "there is a hint of flattening at the low - mass end , but no sign of a drop - off .    as the transformation from the lf to the mf is the weakest part of the present analysis",
    ", we prefer not to comment further on the detailed structure of the mf .",
    "we note only that the slopes of the mfs below @xmath13 , using any existing mlrs , are shallower than the @xmath14 slope ( @xmath15 for the salpeter mf in this notation ) for which the integration of the total mass down to @xmath16 would diverge .",
    "[ comp ]    it is interesting to compare the lfs in fig .  [ comp3v ] and [ comp3i ] with the lfs of other gcs with similar metallicity .",
    "the only other homogeneous set of @xmath0 and @xmath1 lfs extending from the to to @xmath17 has been collected by pck for m15 , m30 , m92 , and ngc  6397 .",
    "in addition , ferraro  ( 1997 ) have published an @xmath1 lf for ngc  6752 .",
    "there are two other clusters , which have a metallicity comparable to m22 and m10 , and for which deep hst lfs have been published : @xmath18 cen ( elson , gilmore , and santiago 1995 ) and m3 ( marconi  1998 ) . in both cases ,",
    "saturation of the brightest stars does not allow to extend the lfs to the to and we will omit them in the present comparison .",
    "as discussed in king  ( 1995 ) and pck , at the intermediate radius at which m15 , m30 , m92 , and ngc  6397 were observed , their lfs are fortuitously close to the global ones , with differences that nowhere exceed a few tenths in the logarithm ( pck ) , with the local lfs being always steeper than the global ones .",
    "so , a comparison of these lfs with the lfs of m10 , m22 , and m55 should be only marginally affected by mass segregation effects .",
    "unfortunately , no detailed dynamical model for ngc  6752 is available at the moment .",
    "we ran a multi - mass king - michie model on this cluster (  section  [ disc ] ) .",
    "we find that the locally observed lfs of ngc  6752 is significantly flatter than the global one .",
    "the metallicity of the three clusters presented in this paper is slightly higher than that of the clusters in pck .",
    "we need to investigate the effect of this metallicity spread on the lfs . in fig .",
    "[ met ] the theoretical lfs for a power law mf with a slope x=0.3 and three different metallicities are plotted together with the @xmath0 lfs of the four clusters in pck used as reference .",
    "the three theoretical lfs are quite similar in the metallicity interval which span the entire metallicity range of the clusters discussed in the following",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ allv ] and [ allid ] compare the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lfs of m10 , m22 , and m55 with the lfs of all the clusters with [ fe / h]@xmath19 available in the literature .",
    "only the lfs which extend to the to are used .",
    "the overall shape of the lfs is similar for the eight clusters , with a steep rise up to @xmath7 ( @xmath20 ) , followed by a drop to the limiting magnitude . as shown in fig .",
    "[ met ] this shape is mainly due to the mass - luminosity relation ( mlr ) and not to the morphology of the mf (  also section  [ mf ] ) . despite the fact that the general trend of these lfs is similar ,",
    "their slope is different .",
    "these differences are much larger than expected from the error bars ( figs .",
    "[ comp3v ] and [ comp3i ] ) and from the cluster metallicity differences ( fig .",
    "[ met ] ) , i.e. imply different ( local ) mfs . in view of the small expected correction for the mass segregation above discussed , this also imply different global present day mfs .    had we chosen to align the lfs at the faint end instead of the bright end , the result would have been the same , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alliu ] .",
    "this figure explicitly shows that the differences among the gc lfs become apparent only when they are extended to the to .",
    "the differences among the lfs noted in the previous section suggest differences among the observed mfs .",
    "they mainly imply that the ratio of the low mass to high mass stars differs from cluster to cluster .",
    "it is interesting to further comment on the possible origin of these differences .",
    "there are two possibilities :    * the differences are primordial , i.e. the galactic gcs are born with different imfs ; * the differences are a consequence of the dynamical evolution , both internal ( energy equipartition , evaporation ) , or externally induced by the gravitational potential of our galaxy .    of course , it is not possible to test the first hypothesis directly , and a combination of the above two possibilities can not be excluded .",
    "pck , relying on the presently available models for m15 , m30 , m92 , and ngc  6397 , and on the galactic orbits of some of these clusters , propose that the different shape of the lf of ngc  6397 with respect to the other three arises from the interaction of this cluster with the galaxy .",
    "it is a consequence of the frequent tidal shocks experienced by ngc  6397 along its orbit .    at the time we are writing this paper ,",
    "the number of clusters at our disposal is more than doubled , though it is still too small for any detailed analysis . as discussed in the previous section , among the gcs with deep hst lfs",
    ", there are 8 clusters with a lf extending from the to to somewhat above 0.1 @xmath21 . as a sort of exercise",
    ", we can try to look for possible dependences of the overall shape of the mfs on the observable parameters which characterize the ggc population .        in view of the still relatively small sample of objects",
    ", we have chosen a very simple approach .",
    "we have limited our analysis to the 3 clusters presented in this paper , the four objects of pck , and ngc  6752 ( ferraro  1997 ) .",
    "the other three objects with deep hst lfs have not been considered as their lfs are not complete , lacking the brightest part ( from @xmath22 m@xmath23 to the to ) .",
    "second , we run a king - michie model in order to have a first approximation correction for the mass segregation effects .",
    "we used the code kindly provided by jay anderson and described in anderson ( 1998 ) , which is based on the gunn and griffin ( 1979 ) formulation of the multimass king ",
    "michie model .",
    "these models have a lowered - maxwellian distribution function , which approximate the steady - state solution of the fokker  planck equation ( king 1965 ) . in the case of the post ",
    "core  collapse ( djorgovski and king 1986 ) clusters these models do not incorporate important physical effects , most importantly , the deviation from a maxwellian distribution function in the collapsed core ( cohn 1980 ) .",
    "however , they are the simplest models that can predict the radial variation of the mf due to energy equipartition , and rather realistically , as shown by king  ( 1995 ) and sosin ( 1997 , see also king 1996 ) . on the other side , as shown by murphy et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for m15 , mass segregation prediction of king - michie models are not very different from what found with more sophisticated fokker  planck models .",
    "for ngc  6397 we used the same model parameters obtained by king ( 1995 ) , for m15 the parameters by sosin and king ( 1997 ) , and for m30 the parameters by sosin ( 1997 ) .",
    "for m92 , we used the model parameters by anderson ( 1998 ) .",
    "the details of the models for the other clusters will be described elsewhere .",
    "we essentially followed the same procedure described in sosin ( 1997 ) .",
    "briefly , we calculated the model by first choosing the core and tidal radii given by trager , king and djorgovski ( 1995 ) .",
    "we then defined 17 mass groups , whose number of stars and averaged masses were constrained to agree with the observed mf at the distance from the cluster center of the observed field .",
    "we then added a group of 0.55 @xmath21 white dwarfs chosen ( somewhat arbitrarely ) to contain 20% of the cluster mass .",
    "finally , we added 1.4 @xmath21 dark remnants and adjusted their mass fraction ( usually around 1.5% ) to make the radial profile of the stars in the brightest bin agree with the surface density profile of trager et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .",
    "one of the outputs of the models are the global mfs for each cluster . in our model ,",
    "the ngc  6752 field is located in a position strongly affected by mass segregation . in view of the large correction",
    "we should apply to its local mf in order to have the global one , the further uncertainties in the model due to the post ",
    "collapse status of this cluster , and the strong deviation from a power law of its mf ( likely a further effect of the mass segregation ) , we will not include ngc  6752 in the following analysis .",
    "we fitted the global mfs of the remaining seven clusters with a power law @xmath24 , and used the index @xmath25 as a parameter indicating the ratio of low mass to high mass stars .",
    "the power law has proven to fit reasonably well all the seven global mfs . in view of the uncertainties associated to the mlr and to the model itself ,",
    "any more sophisticated analysis is not justified .",
    "the slopes of the global present day mfs for @xmath26 for the clusters in our sample are plotted in fig .",
    "[ mfslopes ] against the half mass relaxation time ( @xmath27 ) , the position within the galaxy ( the galactocentric distance @xmath28 and the distance from the disk @xmath29 ) and the destruction rates @xmath30 ( in units of inverse hubble time ) as calculated by gnedin and ostriker ( 1997 ) .",
    "the error bars show the formal error of the fit , and do not include the error in the mlr and the error associated to the mass segregation correction .",
    "the _ full circles _ show the slope of the _ global _ mf , while the _ open circles _ refer to the slopes of the original ( _ local _ ) mf .",
    "as already anticipated , the corrections for mass segregation are in general small .",
    "the discussion which follows applies to both the global and local mfs .",
    "clusters with larger @xmath30 ( and smaller @xmath27 ) tend to have flatter mfs , suggesting that the observed differences in the mf slopes might be related to the cluster dynamical evolution .",
    "there is also an indication of a trend with the distance from the galactic center which resembles a similar dependency suggested by djorgovski , piotto and capaccioli ( 1993 ) , and which has been interpreted in terms of evidences of a dynamical evolution ( capaccioli , piotto and stiavelli 1993 ) .",
    "also a dependency on metallicity can not be excluded , as shown in fig .",
    "[ mfslopes ] .",
    "however , the uncertainty associated to the various transformations from the local lfs to the global mfs , and the small number of points do not allow to assess the significance of any of these trends .",
    "another interesting feature from the slopes in fig .",
    "[ mfslopes ] is their low value . for @xmath31 the mfs",
    "never exceed a slope @xmath32 , ranging in the interval @xmath33 ( in the scale in which the salpeter mf has a slope @xmath15 ) .",
    "also the field star mf is significantly flatter than the salpeter mf in the low mass regime ( tinney 1998 ) .",
    "mera , chabrier , and baraffe ( 1996 ) find a slope @xmath14 for the disk mf for @xmath12 , and scalo ( 1998 ) in his review concludes that an average slope @xmath34 is appropriate for @xmath35 for both galactic clusters and field stars .",
    "a slope @xmath32 is also proposed by kroupa , tout , and gilmore ( 1993 ) and kroupa 1995 for the field stars .",
    "more recently , gould , bahcall , and flynn ( 1996 ) find a smaller @xmath36 for @xmath37 , though this value is uncertain because it is based on a small number of stars .",
    "still , the galactic cluster and field star mf slopes seem to represent an _ upper limit _ to the gc present day mf slopes .",
    "this result implies that either the imf of some gcs was flatter than the field mf , or the present day mfs in gcs do not represent the imf(s ) , at least for some of the clusters in this sample .",
    "this could imply an evolution of the gc mf with time , with a tendency to flatten .",
    "this might be another evidence of the presence of dynamical evolution effects as predicted by the theoretical models ( chernoff and weinberg 1990 , vesperini and heggie 1997 ) and invoked by capaccioli et al . ( 1993 ) and pck in order to explain the observed gc mfs .",
    "another consequence of the flatness of the mf is that the contribution to the total cluster mass by very - low - mass stars and brown dwarfs is likely to be negligible .",
    "of course , the fraction of mass in form of brown dwarfs depends on ( 1 ) the mf slope in the corresponding mass interval and ( 2 ) the lower limit we assume for the brown dwarf masses ( @xmath38 ) . as a working hypothesis",
    ", we might assume that we can extrapolate the mf power law which represents as a first approximation the gc present day mf for @xmath39 to the brown dwarf regime .",
    "we also arbitrarely adopt @xmath40 , which corresponds to the minimum jeans mass at zero metallicity ( silk 1977 ) . even for the steepest slope ( @xmath32 ) in fig .",
    "[ mfslopes ] , stars with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 correspond to the minimum mass for the core hydrogen burning ignition ) contribute to less than 20% of the total mass of the stars with @xmath43 , though they are more than 55% in number .",
    "if the brown dwarf mf is not radically different ( steeper ) than the main sequence mf , they can not contribute in any significant way to the cluster dynamics .",
    "we are deeply grateful to peter stetson for providing us the mask files for vignetting and pixel area correction for wfpc2 , and the psf files , and for providing the most up - to - date versions of his programs .",
    "we thank also jay anderson for making available his multimass king - michie code .",
    "we are particularly indebted to ivan king who carefully read the manuscript and persuasively pushed us to make the mass segregation corrections and the comparisons of the last section .",

    "<S> from a combination of deep hubble space telescope @xmath0 and @xmath1 images with groundbased images in the same bands , we have obtained color  magnitude diagrams of m10 , m22 , and m55 , extending from just above the hydrogen burning limit to the tip of the red giant branch , down to the white dwarf cooling sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we have used the color - magnitude arrays to extract main sequence luminosity functions ( lfs ) from the turnoff to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lfs of m10 is significantly steeper than that for the other two clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the difference can not be due to a difference in metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison with the lfs from piotto , cool , and king ( 1997 ) , shows a large spread in the lf slopes . </S>",
    "<S> this spread is also present in the local mass functions ( mfs ) obtained from the observed lfs using different theoretical mass  luminosity relations . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion in the mf slopes remains also after removing the mass segregation effects by using multimass king - michie models . </S>",
    "<S> the globular cluster mf slopes are also flatter than the mf slope of the field stars and of the galactic clusters in the same mass interval . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the mf slope dispersion and the mf flatness as an evidence of dynamical evolution which makes the present day globular cluster stellar mfs different from the intial mfs . </S>",
    "<S> the slopes of the present day mfs exclude that the low mass star can be dynamically relevant for the galactic globular clusters . </S>"
