    "the ifu records 1000 contiguous spectra simultaneously and an additional 500 sky spectra in a secondary field located at 1.0 arcmin from the primary field .",
    "the ngc  1068 observations on 9 sep 2001 consist of 4 exposures of 900s . obtained with the b600 grating set to a central wavelength of 4900",
    "  and the @xmath9 filter ( required to prevent overlaps in the spectra from each of the two pseudoslits into which the field is reformatted ) . the wavelength range in each spectrum was 4200  5400  .",
    "the seeing was  0.5 arcsec . between exposures",
    "the telescope pointing was offset by a few arcsec to increase the covered area on the sky and to improve the spatial sampling .",

    "the data were reduced using pre - release elements of the gmos data reduction package ( miller et al .",
    "2002 contains some descriptions of the iraf scripts ) . this consisted of the following stages .    * _ geometric rectification_. this joins the three individual ccd exposure ( each of @xmath10 pixels ) into a single synthesised detector plane , applying rotations and offsets determined from calibration observations . at the same time , a global sensitivity correction is applied to allow for the different gain settings of the ccds . before this",
    ", the electronic bias was removed . * _ sensitivity correction_. exposures using continuum illumination provided by the gemini gcal calibration unit were processed as above .",
    "gcal is designed to simulate the exit pupil of the telescope in order to remove calibration errors due to the illumination path .",
    "residual large - scale errors were very small and were removed with the aid of twilight flatfield exposures . the mean spectral shape and the slit function ( which includes the effect of vignetting along the direction of the pseudo - slit ) were determined and used to generate a 2-d surface which was divided into the data to generate a sensitivity correction frame which removes both pixel - pixel variations in sensitivity , including those due to the different efficiencies of the fibres , and longer - scale vignetting loss in the spatial direction .",
    "* _ spectrum extraction_. using the continuum calibration exposures , the 1500 individual spectra were traced in dispersion across the synthesised detector plane .",
    "the trace coefficients were stored for application to the science exposures .",
    "using these , the spectra were extracted by summing with interpolation in the spatial direction a number of pixels equal to the fibre pitch around the mean coordinate in the spatial direction .",
    "although the spectra overlap at roughly the level of the spatial fwhm , resulting in cross - talk between adjacent fibres at the pseudoslit , the effect on spatial resolution is negligible since fibres which are adjacent at the slit are also adjacent in the field and the instrumental response of each spaxel is roughly constant .",
    "furthermore it has no impact on the conditions for nyquist sampling since this is determined at the ifu input ( where @xmath11 spaxels samples the seeing disk fwhm ) and not at the pseudo - slit .",
    "however the overlaps permit much more efficient utilisation of the available detector pixels resulting in a larger field of view for the same sampling ( see allington - smith and content 1998 for further details ) . * _ construction of the datacube_. spectra from the different pointings were assembled into individual datacubes .",
    "the spectra were first resampled onto a common linear wavelength scale using a dispersion relationship determined from 42 - 47 spectral features detected in a wavelength calibration observation . from the fitting residuals we estimate an rms uncertainty in radial velocity of 8 km / s .",
    "the offsets between exposures were determined from the centroid of the bright point - like nucleus in each datacube , after summing in wavelength .",
    "the constituent datacubes were then co - added using interpolation onto a common spatial grid .",
    "the spatial increment was @xmath12 arcsec to minimise sampling noise due to both the hexagonal sampling pattern of the ifu and the offsets not being exact multiples of the ifu sampling increments .",
    "the resampling does not significantly degrade spatial resolution since the resampling increment is much smaller than the nyquist limit of the ifu .",
    "since the spectra had a common linear wavelength scale within each datacube , no resampling was required in the spectral domain .",
    "cosmic ray events were removed by identifying pixels where the data value significantly exceeded that estimated from a fit to neighbouring pixels .",
    "the parameters of the program were set conservatively to avoid false detections .",
    "since each spectrum spans @xmath135 pixels along the slit , distinguishing single - pixel events such as cosmic rays from emission lines which affect the full spatial extent of the spectrum is quite simple . after this the exposures were checked by eye and a few obvious low - level events removed manually using local interpolation . * _ background subtraction_. spectra from the offset field were prepared in the same way as for the object field above , combined by averaging and used to subtract off the background sky signal .",
    "the sky lines were relatively weak in this observation so the accuracy of this procedure was not critical .",
    "the result is a single merged , sky - subtracted datacube where the value at each point is proportional to the detected energy at a particular wavelength , @xmath14 , for a @xmath15 arcsec sample of sky at location @xmath16 . the fully reduced and mosaicked ngc  1068 gmos ifu data cube covers an area on the sky of @xmath17  arcsec with a spatial sampling of 0.1 arcsec per pixel and spectral resolving power of 2500 .",
    "the wavelength range covered was 4170  5420   sampled at 0.456   intervals .",
    "the change in atmospheric dispersion over the wavelength range studied is less than 1 spaxel so no correction has been applied .",
    "the spectra were not corrected to a scale of flux density since this was not required for subsequent analysis",
    "the morphology of the central region changes rapidly across the emission lines .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : frames ] showing a series of monochromatic slices .",
    "the emission lines appear to consist of multiple components whose relative flux , dispersion and radial velocity change with position .",
    "to understand the velocity field of the line - emitting gas , we made multicomponent fits to the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "this was chosen in preference to the brighter o[iii ] @xmath18 4959 , 5007 doublet because of its relative isolation and because the signal / noise was sufficient for detailed analysis .",
    "the fits were performed on the spectra extracted for each spatial sample from the sky - subtracted and wavelength - calibrated datacube after it had been resampled to @xmath19 arcsec covering a field of @xmath20  arcsec and 4830  4920   in wavelength to isolate the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the resampling made the analysis easier by reducing the number of datapoints without loss of spatial information .",

    "the fits were additionally subject to various constraints to preclude unphysical or inherently unreliable fits , such as those with line width less than the instrumental dispersion ( @xmath45 pixels ) or so large as to be confused with errors in the baseline subtraction ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the final value of the fit significance ( not always ) unity was recorded as @xmath47 .",
    "the fits at each datapoint were examined visually and in the small number of cases , where the fits were not satisfactory , a better fit was obtained with an initial choice of parameters chosen by the operator .    the uncertainty in the resulting radial velocities taking into account random and systematic calibration errors was estimated to be @xmath48 .",

    "[ f : transect ] .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 and @xmath49 over the gmos field - of - view suggests that most fits within the region of the source where the signal level is high are reliable but some points near the nucleus have lower reliability , perhaps because the required number of components exceeds @xmath49 .",
    "this is not surprising in regions where the signal / noise ratio is very high .",
    "there is a clear trend to greater numbers of components in the brighter ( nuclear ) regions of the object .",

    "however , the hst longslit data must be interpreted with caution since it is not homogeneous in three dimensions and can not be assembled reliably into a datacube . making direct links between features seen in our data with those of these other authors is not simple , but subjective and ambiguous .",

    "for comparison , fig .",
    "[ f : transect4 ] shows a transect along an axis roughly perpendicular to this .",
    "the following general points may be made from this :    * strong shears in radial velocity are present between north - east and south - west * at each position along the transects there are a number of distinct components with different bulk radial velocity , spanning a large range ( @xmath133000 km / s ) * the majority of the observed flux comes from a component spanned by relative radial velocity 1000  km / s to 0  km / s * this component , if interpreted as a rotation curve has a terminal velocity of @xmath51500 km / s , too large for disk rotation , so is more likely to indicate a biconical outflow with a bulk velocity that increases with distance from the nucleus , reaching an asymptotic absolute value of 500  km / s .",
    "this component also has a large dispersion which is greatest close to the nucleus . *",
    "the closeness in radial velocity between components of modest dispersion within this structure ( at transect distances between 0 and + 1  arcsec ) may arise from uncertainties in the decomposition of the line profiles into multiple components , i.e. two components of moderate dispersion are similar to one component with high dispersion , * the other components are likely to indicate rotation of gas within disk - like structures , if the implied terminal velocities are small enough , or outflows or inflows . * any such flows",
    "do not appear to be symmetric about either the systemic radial velocity or the bulk of the emission close to the nucleus .",
    "a comparison of the stis [ oiii ] emission spectra along various slit positions ( cecil et al . ;",
    "groves et al . )",
    "provides qualitative agreement with our data in that most of the components in our datacube have analogues in their data .",
    "however their data suggest a much more clumpy distribution than ours , which is not surprising given the difference in spatial resolution .",
    "the apparently much greater range of radial velocity in their data is because our component maps indicate the _ centroid _ of the radial velocity of each component , not the full width of the line , which can be considerable ( fwhm of 1000 - 2000 km / s ) .",
    "if we plot the line components in the same way as them , the dominant -1000 to 0 km / s component would fill in the range 2500 to + 1000 in good agreement with their data .",
    "there is evidence of a bulk biconic flow indicative of a jet directed in opposite directions from the nucleus plus a number of flows towards and away from the observer which could be either inflowing or outflowing , but which show a preference to be moving away from the observer .",

    "the @xmath55 individual spectra in the data cube were co - added using a voronoi based binning algorithm ( cappellari & copin 2003 ) . while the improvement in signal / noise is at the expense of spatial resolution , the chosen algorithm is optimised to preserve the spatial structure of the target . a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath56 was used to bin the data , yielding 160 absorption line spectra above this threshold .    the stellar kinematics are extracted from these spectra using the standard stellar template fitting method .",

    "<S> we present a datacube covering the central 10 arcsec of the archetypal active galaxy ngc  1068 over a wavelength range 4200  5400 obtained during the commissioning of the integral field unit ( ifu ) of the gemini multiobject spectrograph ( gmos ) installed on the gemini - north telescope . </S>",
    "<S> the datacube shows a complex emission line morphology in the [ oiii ] doublet and h@xmath0 line . to describe this structure phenomenologically we construct an atlas of velocity components derived from multiple gaussian component fits to the emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> the atlas contains many features which can not be readily associated with distinct physical structures . while some components are likely to be associated with the expected biconical outflow , others are suggestive of high velocity flows or disk - like structures . as a first step towards interpretation , </S>",
    "<S> we seek to identify the stellar disk using kinematical maps derived from the mg@xmath1 absorption line feature at 5170   and make associations between this and gaseous components in the atlas of emission line components .    </S>",
