    "the procedure of particle creation gives rise to an increase of entropy which is proportional with inner friction .",
    "accordingly , production entropy is exactly related to particle creation .",
    "the particle creation entropy was evaluated in terms of specific scale factor considered for the spacetime .",
    "afterward , it was compared production entropy due to particle creation with von neumann entropy as entanglement entropy .",
    "the comparison was shown that both of quantities can be treated in the same way , on equal footing , and both can be linked with each other and expressed as the increasing entropy of the universe due to particle creation . then using these quantities and dependence of them on the field parameters and cosmic parameters we can recover information from the underling structure of the spacetime .",
    "therefore , we can generalize formulation of thermodynamics to quantum formalism .",
    "entanglement can be considered as a source of thermodynamics to properties associated with the universe .",
    "our work implies that the thermodynamics properties of entanglement , in particular entropy , could really be coincided with the results found the customary quantum thermodynamics properties of the spacetime . as a consequents we can employ entanglement in the general thermodynamics picture of the universe .",
    "indeed , it presents an important tool to study observable consequences in cosmology .",
    "we specially appreciate prof .",
    "v. vedral for his comments .",
    "we thank g. najarbashi and m. n. najafi for discussions ."
