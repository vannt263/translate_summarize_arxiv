    "spin dynamics of the charge carriers in organic semiconductors have attracted much attention recently @xcite . on one hand ,",
    "the processes which underlie the use of these systems in the organic light - emitting diodes and organic photovoltaic solar cells , are explicitly spin - dependent , so that understanding of the spin dynamics in organic semiconductors is of fundamental interest for such applications . on the other hand ,",
    "the long spin lifetimes of the carriers in the organic semiconductors make them an interesting candidate for prospective spintronic applications , and the detailed understanding of the mechanisms of the spin relaxation is required .",
    "typically , charge transport in organic semiconductors occurs via random ( incoherent and inelastic ) hopping of the polarons carrying positive or negative charge between localized molecular sites . during the waiting time between two consecutive hops",
    "the carrier spin interacts via hyperfine coupling with the spins of the nuclei ( mostly , hydrogen ) , which surround the host site .",
    "thus , the spin of the carrier waiting for the next hop undergoes rotation around a random axis by a random angle at each site .",
    "the principal role of this mechanism was experimentally confirmed @xcite and supported by a number of spin transport @xcite and spin resonance @xcite measurements , as well as theoretical works . @xcite",
    "another source of spin relaxation is the spin - orbit interaction , which leads to the spin - flip scattering in the course of a hop , but this interaction in organic semiconductors is weak , so the hyperfine - induced spin relaxation is likely to be the main source of depolarization , although other theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies favor the spin - orbit mechanism , and theoretical efforts are made to explain this controversy .",
    "@xcite    spin dynamics of the polarons in low - dimensional systems is of particular interest : in the polymer - based devices the carriers mostly move along the 1d polymer chains , while hopping from one polymer chain to another happens mostly at the intersections .",
    "one - dimensional organic polymer wires can be prepared and their properties can be studied in detail , see e.g.refs .  .",
    "also , engineering low - dimensional systems is a promising way to design organic materials with large magnetoresistance , @xcite which are of much technological interest .",
    "this motivates the theoretical study , described below , of the hyperfine - induced spin relaxation of a carrier diffusing via random walk in @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions .",
    "we investigate in detail not only the ( space- ) integrated spin polarization @xmath3 ( which has been addressed in some previous works @xcite ) , but also the time - integrated polarization @xmath6 at the given point @xmath7 in space , which can be measured in spin - transport experiments .",
    "@xcite we show that for low - dimensional transport , these two quantities are related to each other in a rather non - trivial way .",
    "moreover , we analyze the spin decay length @xmath8 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and show that it is very sensitive to both electric and magnetic fields ; this is important both for applications and for the fundamental studies of the transport in organic semiconductors .",
    "the average polaron hopping rate @xmath9 , corresponding to typical mobilities of @xmath10 to @xmath11 @xmath12v@xmath13s@xmath13 , is of the order of 1100  ghz .",
    "@xcite at the same time , the average hyperfine - induced spin precession frequency is of order @xmath14  mhz .",
    "@xcite therefore , the hopping is much faster than the hyperfine precession , and the carrier performs many random - walk steps before its spin polarization averages out to zero .",
    "thus , the spin relaxation should be sensitive to the statistics of the underlying random walk",
    ". the particularly important feature of the random walk is the frequency of returns of the hopping carrier to the same site , i.e. the frequency of the self - intersections of the random walk trajectories .",
    "when the returns are absent , in the so - called transient diffusion regime@xcite , the random hyperfine field acting on the carrier s spin has no memory : the local hyperfine environments at different sites are uncorrelated , and the carrier hops from one site to another never coming back .",
    "this corresponds to the motional narrowing regime of the spin relaxation @xcite and leads to the exponential decay of the space - integrated spin polarization , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the spin relaxation time for the transient - diffusion regime @xcite .",
    "the opposite scenario with frequent returns , known as the persistent diffusion , takes place when the carriers move in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the frequent returns to the same site lead to the random hyperfine field with long memory ( long - time correlations ) , which suppresses the motional narrowing and leads to faster spin relaxation .",
    "the role of the memory of the hyperfine field has been studied for some scenarios , and has been found to change the spin relaxation of the spin polarization in @xmath1 case to @xmath17}$ ] at short times @xcite , with the decay time @xmath18 depending on the particular model for the hyperfine fields .",
    "also , it has been noticed that the returns make @xmath3 very sensitive to the external magnetic field.@xcite    -direction .",
    "the separation between the injecting and detecting electrodes is @xmath19.,width=283 ]    however , the detailed knowledge about the carrier s spin relaxation in the case of low - dimensional transport is still largely lacking , and our work aims at filling this gap .",
    "we investigate analytically and numerically the spin relaxation for lateral and vertical spin valves ( fig .",
    "[ latvert ] ) , with the carriers moving along the 1d current - carrying channels .",
    "we consider the limit of small current density , when each carrier moves independently of others , thus working within the single - particle framework .",
    "for the lateral spin valve , fig .",
    "[ latvert](a ) , the spin carrier hops along the very long linear chain , performing an unbounded random walk . for the vertical spin valve , fig .",
    "[ latvert](b ) , the random walk happens over finite - size chain with reflecting boundaries . in both cases",
    "we assume that the carrier is injected with the spin state `` up '' at @xmath20 , and its spin is probed by the detector at @xmath21 .",
    "we study the space - integrated spin polarization @xmath3 and the time - integrated polarization @xmath6 at the given point @xmath7 , which can be measured with the detector lead at a given location .",
    "we demonstrate that these quantities exhibit remarkable universal features , and that the returns in the course of the carrier diffusion play an important role in this relation .",
    "first , for the time decay of @xmath3 , we demonstrate the evidence of the universal scaling : for different values of the hyperfine coupling strength @xmath22 and hopping rate @xmath9 , the decay of @xmath3 follows the same curve which depends only on the normalized dimensionless time @xmath23 . this scaling holds not only for short times , where @xmath3 follows the previously known decay law @xmath24}$ ] , but also at long times , where we find a previously unnoticed stretched - exponential decay @xmath25 ( for both spin valve geometries ) .",
    "this scaling holds for both lateral and vertical spin - valve geometries , at finite magnetic and electric field .",
    "also , we found that @xmath3 , besides the known sensitivity to the magnetic field , is also very sensitive to the electric field .",
    "we have observed the similarly strong effect of the returns for the spin relaxation in @xmath2 , leading to the logarithmic corrections to the standard exponential decay of @xmath3 , and strong sensitivity to the external fields .",
    "second , we studied the time - integrated polarization @xmath5 , which is of much importance for the spin - dependent transport measurements .",
    "we are not aware of any analytical theory for this quantity , but our numerical studies reveal unexpected universality in its behavior . for persistent diffusion in low dimensions , in contrast to the transient diffusion in 3d ,",
    "the quantity @xmath5 is not directly related to @xmath3 .",
    "our numerical results show that , despite the essentially non - exponential decay of @xmath3 , the spin transport decay is exponential , @xmath26 , with high accuracy , even in the presence of the external magnetic and electric fields .",
    "however , the resemblance to the usual 3d transient - diffusion result is superficial : for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases , the dependence of the spin decay length @xmath8 on the external fields is very strong , in contrast to the standard 3d diffusion .",
    "our results suggest that the character of the carrier diffusion in an organic semiconductor can be studied in spin transport experiments , via the field dependence of @xmath8 , and vice versa , the spin transport measurements in low - dimensional organic semiconductors can be used for accurate sensing of electric and magnetic fields , and for other similar spintronic applications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the formulation of the problem and the methods used for analytical and numerical studies . in sections [ seclat ] and [ secvert ] we consider the spin relaxation for the lateral and the vertical spin - valve geometries , respectively .",
    "section [ sectwod ] outlines our results on the spin relaxation in @xmath2 .",
    "details of the analytical calculations are presented in two appendices .",
    "we consider a carrier hopping between sites , see fig .  [ chain](a ) , which model organic molecules or conjugated segments of polymers . everywhere below , for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we enumerate sites by the integer variable @xmath7 , so that e.g.for 1d chain the physical coordinate of the site is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the distance between the sites .    when the polaron is localized at the site with the radius - vector @xmath29 its spin interacts with @xmath30 nuclei @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) surrounding the given site .",
    "below we assume that all nuclei have spin 1/2 , since the protons in many organic semiconductors are the most abundant species with the largest nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the spin dynamics of the carrier localized at the site @xmath7 is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hyperfine coupling constant between the carrier spin and nuclear spin @xmath31 , and @xmath35 is the larmor frequency of the carrier spin @xmath36 in an external magnetic field along the @xmath37 axis ( everywhere below we take @xmath38 and the electron s gyromagnetic ratio @xmath39 , omitting the difference between the magnetic fields and the larmor frequencies )",
    ". theoretical approach to the spin evolution in organic semiconductors customarily relies on the approximation where the quantum hyperfine field given by the sum in eq .",
    "( [ locham ] ) , @xmath40 is approximated as a static classical vector @xmath41 of random amplitude and direction , sampled from the gaussian distribution with zero mean and the standard deviation equal to @xmath42 ; this approximation is justified by the large number of nuclear spins coupled to the carrier spin at a given site ( @xmath30 of order @xmath43 or more)@xcite .",
    "we also assume that the hyperfine fields at different sites are uncorrelated , so that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .     and @xmath2 dimensional regular lattices of molecular sites ( gray circles ) . (",
    "a ) in the absence of external electric field , polaron hops between the nearest neighbor sites of @xmath1 linear chain occur with the equal rates , @xmath46 , indicated by the blue arrows .",
    "( b ) in the presence of external electric field along the linear chain , hopping rates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively in the directions forward and backward to the electric field , are different ; @xmath49 .",
    "( c ) with an external electric field along the @xmath50 axis of a regular lattice in @xmath2 , hopping rates in the forward and backward directions to @xmath51 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , can depend on the electric field , while the rates in the perpendicular direction are the same as without the field , and equal to @xmath52 each.,width=340 ]    when we consider a carrier with the initial spin along @xmath53 , performing a random walk with trajectory @xmath54 , the carrier s spin @xmath55 evolves according to the equation of motion @xmath56 where the matrix @xmath57 describes the spin rotation taking place at the site @xmath7 .",
    "formal solution of this equation can be written in terms of the time - ordered exponent , @xmath58 with the initial condition @xmath59 .",
    "the spin polarization is obtained by double averaging of the @xmath37-component of @xmath60 , @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes averaging over the random walk trajectories , @xmath63 denotes averaging over the local hyperfine fields , and the indices @xmath64 denote that we need to take the @xmath64 entry of the matrix which results after the averaging of the time - ordered matrix exponent .    without returns , all spin rotations at different sites would be independent and uncorrelated , leading to exponential decay of the polarization as a function of time ( the motional narrowing regime ) . in the presence of the returns ,",
    "the rotations at different moments of time are correlated , and the polarization decay accelerates . in @xmath1 ,",
    "the number of returns of the charge carrier to a given site after @xmath65 hops is @xmath66 , whereas in @xmath2 and @xmath4 this number is @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "@xcite therefore one should expect that the influence of the returns is strong in @xmath1 , modest in @xmath2 , and weak in @xmath4 dimensions ; below we concentrate mainly on the @xmath1 case where the effect is strongest .",
    "the exact solution of eq .",
    "( [ dbav ] ) in the presence of returns is not available . in order to approach the problem , everywhere below",
    "we employ the fact that the hopping is much faster than rotation in the hyperfine field , so the parameter @xmath69 is small .",
    "indeed , the value of @xmath70 is typically of order of 100  mhz , while the average carrier hopping rate @xmath9 is about 1100  ghz , so @xmath71 we can calculate @xmath3 via the cumulant expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "the odd cumulants vanish ( since the local gaussian distributions of @xmath76 have zero mean ) , the first non - vanishing cumulant @xmath77 will determine the behavior of @xmath3 , at least at short times .",
    "we will demonstrate the accuracy of this approach by comparing the analytically calculated @xmath77 with the results of the direct numerical simulations .",
    "the numerical simulations are even more important for studying the time - integrated polarization @xmath6 . we are not aware of any analytical theory for this quantity which would provide insights and guide our investigation . thus , we rely solely on the numerical results , which demonstrate surprising and interesting universal features of @xmath6 .",
    "one could do numerical simulations by monte - carlo sampling of the random - walk trajectories and the distributions of the local fields , thus calculating the average in eq .",
    "( [ dbav ] ) directly .",
    "however , our results show that the statistical error is quite large , so instead we employ the approach based on the liouville equation .",
    "we describe the carrier spin via its density matrix @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the probability to find the carrier at site @xmath29 at time @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is its spin polarization ; @xmath82 is the vector of pauli matrices .",

    "the solution @xmath91 of eq .",
    "( [ mem ] ) includes averaging over the random - walk trajectories of the duration @xmath80 , but the hyperfine fields at each site are taken as having some specific directions and amplitudes , i.e.  the set @xmath92 of the local fields is fixed .",
    "averaging over the local hyperfine fields is performed via monte - carlo sampling of @xmath93 at each site from the gaussian distribution @xmath94 .",
    "in particular , in this way we determine the time - integrated spin polarization at a given location , @xmath95 which plays an important role in the spin transport measurements .",
    "the effect of the external magnetic field is included into our model by simply adding the external field @xmath96 to the local hyperfine fields .",
    "the external electric field @xmath97 applied along the @xmath50-axis ( figs .",
    "[ latvert ] and [ chain ] ) is taken into account by modifying the hopping rates : the hops along the field are more probable than backwards .",
    "below , we assume , in the spirit of the miller - abrahams theory , @xcite that the backward hopping rate @xmath48 ( upwards in the electric field potential ) is exponentially suppressed in comparison with the forward hopping rate @xmath47 ( downwards in the electric potential ) , i.e.@xmath98 , where @xmath99 with the boltzmann constant @xmath100 and temperature @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is the electric potential difference between two neighboring sites , while the forward - hopping rate remains unchanged , @xmath103 .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 , we have @xmath104",
    "we neglect the effect of injector / detector electrodes , assuming insignificant tunneling between the leads and the semiconductor . for the lateral spin valve",
    "this implies unbounded diffusion over an infinite chain . for numerical simulations",
    ", we used a long chain with periodic or reflecting boundary conditions ; the length was large enough to ensure vanishing population near the ends at all times .",

    "@xmath118 the next non - vanishing cumulant , @xmath116 , is determined by the 4-th order correlation function of the process @xmath119 .",
    "our calculations in appendix [ appb ] show that it has small numerical prefactor , @xmath120 , so that this cumulant becomes comparable to @xmath115 only at rather long times .",
    "thus , @xmath77 dominates the polarization decay at small times : @xmath121 excellent accuracy of this scaling at short times is seen from comparison with the direct numerical simulations in fig .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "the similar decay law , @xmath122 , has been obtained in earlier studies , which assumed the single - axis local hyperfine fields ( directed along the @xmath37-axis ) @xcite , or the hyperfine fields with fixed amplitude randomly distributed in the @xmath50@xmath123 plane @xcite .",
    "our results confirm this decay law for the hyperfine fields distributed isotropically in space , and show that this feature holds for a very wide range of problems related to the spin decay during 1d diffusion ; we will also see the same decay law below , for the vertical spin valve case .",
    "more importantly , we notice that @xmath77 and @xmath124 depend only on the single dimensionless renormalized time @xmath125 . from eqs .",
    "( [ mem ] ) and ( [ eqwrr ] ) one can see that all cumulants , as well as @xmath3 itself , are the functions of two dimensionless quantities , @xmath126 and @xmath72 . however , our analytical and numerical studies evidence a much stronger result , that @xmath3 is a function of a _ single _ dimensionless quantity @xmath111 .",

    "this holds at all times we studied , even at large @xmath111 , when the contribution from the high - order cumulants is important .",
    "even more , we see that the same scaling holds when we consider the polarization decay at finite magnetic fields , finite electric fields , as well as for the case of the vertical spin valve ( both without fields and with external magnetic and/or electric fields ) . thus , it is highly likely that the renormalized time @xmath111 represents a universal feature of the spin decay for @xmath1 random walk .",
    "understanding of this remarkable scaling , as far as we know , is lacking .",
    "another interesting feature , seen from fig .",
    "[ scaling ] , is the decay of @xmath3 at long times , which has a stretched - exponential form @xmath127 , with @xmath128 ; we checked that this form remains very accurate all the way down to @xmath129 .",

    "equally interesting is the behavior of the time - integrated polarization @xmath6 .",
    "we are not aware of any analytical theory , which would provide insights in the behavior of this quantity and guide our simulations .",

    "the origin of this scaling , as well as the origin of the exponential dependence of @xmath105 , are not clear .    note that the exponential decay of @xmath105 in the case of 1d persistent diffusion is not trivial .",
    "if multiple returns were negligible ( as in transient diffusion in 3d ) , @xmath3 would decay exponentially with the decay time @xmath16 ; the space- and time - integrated polarizations then would be related by the simple convolution @xcite , @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the probability to find the carrier at the site @xmath7 at time @xmath80 , see eq .",

    "<S> the hyperfine coupling between the spin of a charge carrier and the nuclear spin bath is a predominant channel for the carrier spin relaxation in many organic semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically investigate the hyperfine - induced spin relaxation of a carrier performing a random walk on a @xmath0-dimensional regular lattice , in a transport regime typical for organic semiconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in @xmath1 and @xmath2 the time dependence of the space - integrated spin polarization , @xmath3 , is dominated by a superexponential decay , crossing over to a stretched exponential tail at long times . </S>",
    "<S> the faster decay is attributed to multiple self - intersections ( returns ) of the random walk trajectories , which occur more often in lower dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show , analytically and numerically , that the returns lead to sensitivity of @xmath3 to external electric and magnetic fields , and this sensitivity strongly depends on dimensionality of the system ( @xmath1 vs. @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we investigate in detail the coordinate dependence of the time - integrated spin polarization , @xmath5 , which can be probed in the spin transport experiments with spin - polarized electrodes . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , while @xmath5 is essentially exponential , the effect of multiple self - intersections can be identified in transport measurements from the strong dependence of the spin decay length on the external magnetic and electric fields . </S>"
