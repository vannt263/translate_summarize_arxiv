    "the near  infrared source ngc 2264 irs1 ( iras 06384 + 0932 , allen 1972 ) is a relatively isolated luminous infrared source ( distance 800 pc ) in the star  forming region ngc 2264 .",
    "previous observations @xcite suggest that irs1 is a young star located within a dense molecular core .",
    "this core is embedded in a more extended co envelope .",
    "the 2200 @xmath1 m luminosity of @xmath3 3500 l@xmath4 ( harvey , campbell , & hoffman , 1977 ) implies an early b  type zero  age main  sequence star @xcite .",

    "two outflow systems were reported in this region @xcite , one at the position of irs1 and a second one associated with a deeply embedded small star cluster @xmath5 to the southeast of irs1 .",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2000 ) found a ridge ( ngc 2264 mms ) of bright submm- and mm  emission around irs1",
    "wherein five emission peaks ( mms15 ) are located .",

    ", we focus on the infrared source irs1 and its nearest environment ( diameter @xmath10 ) .",
    "we studied this region in the @xmath11(2.2@xmath1m)band with eso s ntt as well as in the cs 2@xmath01 line and the 3-mm continuum using the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) .",
    "additional thermal infrared data came from observations with eso s mid - infrared camera timmi2 .",
    "the aim of this study was to answer the following questions : what is the reason for the displaced centre of the bipolar outflow seen with single  dish telescopes ( e.g.   schreyer et al .",
    "does the presence of a `` wiggled jet '' possibly originating from irs1 imply the existence of a disk around irs1 ? is this twisted jet dense enough to be traced with the pdbi in order to obtain some information about the velocity structure ?",
    "is there an opposite `` jet  like '' feature to confirm the suggestion of a ( bipolar ) jet ? finally , we wanted to learn what the nature of the central engine is .",
    "near  infrared images of ngc  2264  irs  1 were obtained with sofi at eso s new technology telescope ( ntt ) on 1999 march 3 in the ks band .",
    "these observations were performed in polarization mode , i.e. , with the wollaston prism and a slit mask at a pixel scale of 0295 .",
    "after standard image processing ( flat  fielding , sky removal and bad  pixel correction ) the total intensity image resulted from the co  addition of four frames taken at polarizer orientations of 45@xmath12 90@xmath12 135@xmath12 and 180@xmath13 the total integration time amounts to 384 seconds .",
    "the observing conditions were very good , leading to a fwhm of the stellar images of 057 .",
    "furthermore , for the central overlap region of the stripes ( covering irs1 and its near vicinity ) these data were used to deduce a polarisation map .",
    "imaging at 11.9@xmath1 m ( pixel scale 0202 ) and 4.6 @xmath1 m ( pixel scale 0315 ) was performed on 2001 march 18 with timmi2 @xcite at eso s 3.6-m telescope .",
    "chopping was done perpendicular to nodding ; the offset throw for both movements was 20@xmath2 at 11.9@xmath1 m and 30@xmath2 at 4.6 @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "we restored the original field of view by applying the projected landweber restoration method ( bertero , boccacci , & robberto 2000 ) to the data , which we modified for our purposes ( see linz et al .",
    "2003 ) .    with the pdbi @xcite , we observed cs 2@xmath01 as well as the corresponding continuum emission at 97.98 ghz .",
    "successful observations were obtained with five 15-m antennas in august and november 1998 using baseline lengths between 21254 m. we applied one correlator unit with a total bandwidth of 10 mhz centred at the cs 2@xmath01 line ( v@xmath14  = + 8.0 kms@xmath15 ) which leads to a velocity resolution of 0.12 km s@xmath15 ( @xmath16 0.039 mhz ) .",
    "two spectral correlator units , each with a bandwidth of 160 mhz , were assigned to the measurements of the continuum .",
    "the band pass and phase calibration was performed with the objects 3c454.3 , 0528 + 134 , and 0748 + 126 .",
    "compelled by a flux loss of @xmath35080% in the pdbi cs 2@xmath01 data compared to our previous iram single - dish data ( schreyer et al .",
    "1997 ) , we combined our iram 30-m cs 2@xmath01 map ( extent = 2@xmath17 2@xmath18 = twice as large as the pdb primary beam ) and the pdb interferometer data in order to fill up information about the missing flux between that zero - spacing and the shortest spacing from the interferometer .",
    "the iram map was fourier  transformed and then fiddled into the pdb visibility data . hereby , we benefit from the fact , that the diameter of the single - dish telescope ( 30  m ) is twice as large as the one of the interferometer telescopes ( 15  m ) , and that we have also included short baselines ( down to 21  m ) for the interferometer measurements . thus ,",
    "regarding the density of uv points , there is a relatively smooth transition from the contribution of the single - dish data to the contribution of short  baseline interferometer data . with the visibilities resulting from the fourier  transformed single  dish map we completely cover the uv points of the shortest pdb baseline .",
    "maps of 256@xmath19256 square pixels with 0.5@xmath2 pixel size were produced by fourier  transforming the calibrated visibilities , using natural weighting .",

    "3.21@xmath2@xmath191.95@xmath2 for the line map ( with zero  spacing correction ) , each with a position angle of 21@xmath20 for the data reduction and the final phase calibration , we used the grenoble software environment gag .",

    "the six low  mass companions to the south of irs1 coincide with the faint objects shown in the hst nicmos image obtained by thompson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who labeled these as object 1 to 6 .",
    "an additional very faint object 7 was found ( see table  [ pos ] ) which was not recognized by thompson et al .   since it was close to the diffraction spikes in the nicmos images .",
    "the other most intense @xmath11band stars , seen in the ntt image , are denoted with 8 to 13 .",
    "object 8 seems to be of special interest since it is not point  like but marginally extended in the ns direction . while the overall polarization is caused by scattered light from irs  1 , object 8 shows its own centrosymmetric polarization pattern ( see fig .  [ pol ] ) , confirming that this object is surrounded by circumstellar dust .",
    "thus , we identify object 8 as an young stellar object in the immediate vicinity of irs  1 .",
    "this result is confirmed by archival nicmos images taken for testing the coronograph ( proposal i d .",
    "[ nic ] is a composite we constructed from these nicmos images which shows that object 8 is a binary .",
    "the projected separation of the two components amounts to 0.27@xmath2@xmath210.01@xmath2 (= 216 au ) which is somewhat larger compared to the gg tau binary system with a projected separation of 38 au .",
    "in addition , the faint object 7 is present in this figure .",
    "the ntt image exhibits a similar jet  like feature  as found in the previous low  resolution images by hodapp ( 1994 ) and schreyer et al .",
    "( 1997 )  which looks like a twisted gas stream to the north of irs1 .",
    "however , both , the ntt and the nicmos images do not clarify the true origin of this feature .",
    "we note that , based on the images alone , the illuminated features to the north could be also material which ablates from the surface of a denser cloud clump behind irs1 .    with timmi2",
    "we find three sources at 11.9 @xmath1 m in the restored field of view ( fig .",
    "[ timmi2 ] ) .",
    "we detect irs1 itself as well as the most luminous member of the small star cluster @xmath5 southeast of irs1 @xcite .",
    "since both sources have counterparts at 2.2 @xmath1 m , we can adopt the near  infrared astrometry for the restored timmi2 image . in doing so",
    ", we find that the third weak infrared source at 11.9 @xmath1 m is located at the position of mm  source s1 ( see sect .",
    "[ 3 mm ] ) . since we used the default chopping throw of @xmath22 in north ",
    "south direction , the s1 counterpart is unfortunately placed very near to irs1 in the chopped and nodded raw image .",
    "although we could recover its true position by applying our image restoration algorithm , the photometric information is strongly affected , so we will not report a photometry here . at 4.6 @xmath1 m",
    "we did not detect the s1 counterpart which speaks for a deeply embedded object .",
    "however , we clearly detect the nir object 8 also at 4.6 @xmath1 m which further increases the reliability of our thermal infrared astrometry .",
    "but more important , this detection reveals a clear infrared excess for object 8 , which provides strong evidence for dusty circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) material very near the related young stellar object(s ) .",
    "[ csfig ] shows the results of the pdbi measurements . the total integrated cs 2@xmath01 line emission ( continuum subtracted and zero  spacing corrected , contour levels @xmath2450% of the peak emission , fig .",
    "[ csfig]a ) is overlaid with the ntt image for a better comparsion of the @xmath11band objects .",
    "cs emission with more than 30% of the peak fills the entire area of the primary beam .",
    "the cs map implies that irs1 is located in a low  density cavity surrounded by denser gas clumps which are possibly cut by the extent of the primary beam .",
    "this morphology is in a good agreement with the h@xmath7co 1@xmath00 data obtained by nakano et al .",
    "if we assume that irs1 is located in the cavity centre then the mean diameter of the cavity is @xmath25 ( @xmath26 au ) which matches the extent of the @xmath11band nebulosity .",
    "thus , some of the dark cloud clumps are partly located in front or behind the cavity . however , the turbulence inside the clouds is too large in order to find hints from their spectra about the true spatial locations .",
    "both the north- and the southeastern clumps ( mms4b / c and mms5a / b / c see fig .",
    "[ csfig]a ) coincide with the more extended continuum emission peaks mms 4 and 5 detected by ward ",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2000 ) and have counterparts in h@xmath7co ( nakano et al .  2003 : mms5 = hc1 + hc2 , mms4 = hc3 + hc4 ) .",
    "however , the cs clump mms 4a shows no well  defined counterpart neither in the data of ward ",
    "thompson et al .",
    "nor in the data of nakano et al . at the position of irs1 ,",
    "no dense gaseous disk was found . only a small gas clump ( mms 4d )",
    "was detected between the positions of irs1 and the low ",
    "mass ` object 3 ' which could be the place of the origin of the twisted gas stream .",
    "however , the uncertainty of the overlay positions of @xmath32@xmath2 makes it impossible to clarify the true association .",
    "the study of the entire data cube implies that the dynamics of the gas in the observed sky region is very complex . in sect .",
    "[ s_out ] , we will report different outflow systems and gas streams in much more detail .",
    "[ sp ] displays selected spectra of different map positions .",
    "it is not clear , however , if the cs line is subsequently absorbed , or the spectra present a number of optically thin velocity components .",
    "the shape of the spectra varies strongly from position to position . in the observed area",
    ", there are hints that the emission at the peak positions of the denser cloud clumps can be absorbed ( fig .",
    "[ sp ] : mms 4a , irs1 , s1 ) . however , at other selected positions , e.g.  the gas of the twisted @xmath11band feature ( see sect .  [ s_out ] , map in fig .",
    "[ csfig]d , and spectra in fig .",
    "[ sp ] : gas stream blue , red ) , the emission appears to be optically thin .",
    "we estimated the gas mass of the dense cloud fragments inside the 50% contour level applying the formula ( 2 ) given by nakamura et al .",
    "although the assumptions of lte and an optically thin cs line emission are not met in our case , we can obtain a lower mass limit using a kinetic temperature of 20 k and a cs abundance of 10@xmath27 table [ xx ] summarises the integrated line emissions and the gas masses for several cloud clumps .",
    "although we cover slightly differnet sky areas for the different cloud clumps , the mass estimates agree well with the results found by nakano et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for the more extended continuum emission as well as for the h@xmath7co@xmath8 measurements .",
    "three rather weak 3-mm continuum point sources above the 3@xmath28 level ( s1 , s2 , and s3 , see fig .",
    "[ csfig]b ) were detected .",
    "the coordinates of the point sources are listed in table  [ pos ] and agree well with the peaks of the more extended continumm emission regions mc1 ( peak s1 ) , mms4 ( peak s2 ) , mms5 ( peak s3 ) by nakano et al .",
    "the pdb interferometer did not trace the more extended mm ",
    "emission seen by ward ",
    "thompson et al .  ( 2000 ) and nakano et al .  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the total integrated continuum fluxes are 8.2 mjy , 4.0 mjy , and 1.4 mjy , and the peak fluxes amount to 9.5 , 6.4 , and 5.1 mjy beam@xmath29 respectively .",
    "neither of these sources is coincident with irs1 .",
    "the strongest mm ",

    "source s3 is associated with the faint @xmath11band object 7 in the ntt image .    using a standard mass derivation algorithm as described by henning et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we estimated gas masses of 3.5 m@xmath4  for s1 , 1.8 m@xmath4  for s2 , and 0.6 m@xmath4  for s3 , using a dust temperature of 20 k , a distance of 800 pc , a gas  to  dust mass ratio of 150 , and a mass absorption coefficient of @xmath30 = 0.2 @xmath31 g@xmath15 ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 : thin icy mantles , gas density of 10@xmath32 @xmath33 ) , and a density gradient @xmath34 .",

    "@xmath1 m is very remarkable .",
    "the blue outflow lobe seems to be stopped or redirected into our line of sight very close to irs1 .",
    "the outflow masses of the blue ( and the mapped part of the red ) flow were estimated using the integrated cs intensities @xmath24 3@xmath28 which corresponds to the 30% level contour of the map peaks .",
    "the blue flow contains 4.610@xmath35 m@xmath4  and the mapped red part 2.510@xmath35 m@xmath4 . for comparison",
    ", we estimate the masses traced with the cs 5@xmath04 jcmt measurements ( schreyer et al .",
    "1997 ) : both the blue and red components contain 0.2 m@xmath4 , indicating that the interferometer data trace only the densest flow parts .",
    "the estimation of the dynamical flow age is in this case not possible , since the blue flow is redirected and the red flow is cut by the primary beam .",
    "two bipolar outflows 2a and 2b are produced by the binary object 8 with an angle between them of @xmath362@xmath36 in the sky plane .",
    "the outflow 2a is , however , much more intense than the outflow 2b .",
    "the peaks of the red and blue  shifted cs emission of outflow 2a are roughly 810@xmath2 ( projected distance = 6810@xmath37au ) away from the central object . since the red lobe of the outflow 2b is rather short and ceases near irs1 , we speculate that the binary object 8 can be located in front of irs1 . a third outflow ( outflow 3 )",
    "is associated with the infrared object 9 .",
    "based on the number of outflows around irs1 , we can conclude that in the whole observed region around irs1 , the star ",
    "forming process is still on  going . with our images ,",
    "we detect the _ true _ baby stars which are _ not _ the objects in the hst image presented by thompson et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "the morphology of these outflows implies that irs1 is not the origin of the bipolar outflow always detected with previous single  dish observations .",
    "[ csfig]d shows two cs channel maps .",
    "one of the channel maps shows that the twisted jet ",
    "like @xmath11band feature arising close to irs1 has a counterpart in the cs gas in a very narrow velocity range between 7.34 and 7.89 kms@xmath15  which fits very well the `` zig  zag '' structure of the gas stream .",
    "an opposite jet  like feature may be present in the second channel map",
    ". however , this gas pours into a denser cloud region .",
    "thus the red  shifted gas stream is not so well separated as the blue",
    " shifted one .",
    "both channel maps clarify that the gas streams present undisturbed gas flows .",
    "the twisted shape may be produced by a precession of the central star .",
    "based on the position uncertainties of the overlay , it is not really clear if irs1 or the infrared object 3 is the origin of the bipolar gas stream or if there is a third obscured object between both sources . in addition , fig .",
    "[ csfig]c shows a blue  shifted gas blob at the `` end '' of the infrared gas stream which seems to be produced by the piercing of the covering dark cloud .",
    "we can conclude that irs1 is in a more evolved evolutionary state than the young b ",
    "type objects afgl 490 @xcite or g192.163.82 ( shepherd , claussen , & kurtz 2001 ) which show strong evidence for disks .",
    "these results showed that massive accretion disks orbiting b23 stars in the first 10@xmath3710@xmath38 yrs of their main  sequence lifetime exist .",
    "however , these disks are unstable and might disappear , for instance , due to gravitational instabilities ( e.g. , schreyer et al .",
    "irs1 seems to be in this phase where the accretion disk already disappeared and a small cavity was created , although , the star is still embedded in the centre of a more extended cloud core @xcite .",
    "the power of irs1 leads to induced star formation in the surrounding denser cloud clumps , where a number of young stellar objects are embedded powering bipolar outflows .",
