    ", the singularity is also consistently understandable from the matter part where the standard statistical mechanics formalism applies to the early radiation dominated universe : the energy density of the universe , determined by the standard stefan - boltzmann law , and the associated entropy density diverge at big bang singularity .",
    "the energy density is directly related to the hubble parameter in standard friedmann cosmology while the entropy density is proportional to the inverse of the size of the universe through the adiabatic evolution of the universe .",
    "therefore , the divergences of the geometrical and thermodynamical quantities are consistent in standard early universe cosmology .",
    "but the big bang singularity remains as an unsolved problem : both of the classical einstein s equations and standard thermostatistics can not explain the state of the universe at such a high energy regime .",
    "quantum gravity candidates such as loop quantum gravity and string theory suggest the existence of a minimum length scale ( of the order of the planck length ) below of which no other length can be probed @xcite .",

    "the hubble parameter gets a maximum and there is a nonzero minimum size for the universe at the bounce .",
    "existence of this geometrical maximum bound on the hubble parameter immediately implies a maximum bound for the energy density through the friedmann equation .",
    "also , a maximum entropy density bound arises through the adiabatic evolution of the universe since the universe has a nonzero minimum size in lqc .",
    "these bounds on the energy and entropy densities , however , are not naturally supported by the standard statistical mechanics formalism .",
    "this inconsistency is understandable : the statistical mechanics formalism should be of course modified in order to include quantum gravity ( minimal length ) effects when one considers the modified geometry of lqc for the geometric part of the einstein s equations .",
    "the question then arises : how the statistical mechanics would be modified in the context of lqc while it only deals with the quantization of the geometry and not the matter ? to answer this question , we note that at the flat limit , with which we are interested in the context of statistical mechanics , the fundamental quantum theory of gravity such as loop quantum gravity would reduce to a deformed ( doubly ) special relativity ( dsr ) which supports the existence of minimum observer - independent length scale @xcite . in the absence of the final and well - established quantum theory of gravity , one can do in reverse : starting from the standard special relativity and deform it in such a way that it includes an invariant length scale .",

    "taking the equivalence relation ( [ equivalence ] ) into account , we can fix the functional form of @xmath31 by referring to these candidates .",
    "this is what we can do at least in the absence of full quantum gravity theory .",
    "here we would like to fix @xmath31 by invoking the effective friedmann equations that are suggested by lqc . following the method we introduce in this paper",
    ", one can also fix the functional form of @xmath31 through the string cosmology setup @xcite .    for the case of flat flrw universe , the modified friedmann equation in lqc framework",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the critical energy density which is also the maximum accessible energy density for the universe .",
    "this quantity coincides with the maximum energy density @xmath39 that perviously has been defined in ( [ equivalence ] ) .",
    "the two dimensionless parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are the barbero - immirzi parameter and the minimum eigenvalue of the area operator @xcite respectively .",

    "the energy conservation relation remains unchanged in lqc setup and for the case of radiation dominated universe is given by @xmath55 the modified friedmann equation ( [ lqc - friedmann ] ) is obtained from the unique representation of holonomy - flux algebra in lqc .",

    "this is because of the fact that the matter part is not modified in lqc setup while it gets uv modifications in rainbow cosmology through the modified dispersion relation @xcite ( see also section 5 ) . for the case of radiation",
    "dominated universe , the modification to the matter part results in deformed equation of state parameter @xcite . substituting ( [ f ] ) into the relation ( [ bianchi2 ] )",
