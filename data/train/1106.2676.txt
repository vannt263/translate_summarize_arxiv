    "this paper studies singularities of tropical surfaces in @xmath0 .",
    "the question what the analogue of a singularity in the tropical world should be is quite natural to ask and has consequently interested several authors recently ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that this question is hard to answer in general makes it even more intriguing .",
    "we define a point @xmath1 in a tropical surface @xmath2 to be singular if there is an algebraic surface @xmath3 , defined over the puiseux - series , whose tropicalisation is @xmath2 and which is singular at a point @xmath4 that tropicalises to @xmath1 . given a non - degenerate lattice polytope @xmath5 ,",
    "consider the family @xmath6 of singular hypersurfaces in the toric threefold defined by @xmath7 whose defining equations have newton polytope @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 is non - defective , i.e.  that @xmath8 is a hypersurface in @xmath9 , defined by a polynomial which is then called the discriminant of @xmath7 .",
    "the tropicalisation @xmath10 of @xmath8 has been studied in @xcite and is called the tropical discriminant . while a general member of @xmath8 has exactly one singular point , namely a node , an analogous statement is not true in tropical geometry .",
    "the reason is that for a given singular tropical surface , there can be several singular tropical surfaces tropicalising to it , but such that the resp .  singular points tropicalise to different points in the tropical surface .",
    "consequently , there are also tropical surfaces with infinitely many singularities",
    ". the subset of singular points of a tropical surface does not seem to have any nice structure however , in particular it is not a tropical subvariety .",
    "examples 4.5 and 4.3 of @xcite show tropical curves with infinitely many resp .",
    "two singular points .",
    "we concentrate on singular tropical surfaces of maximal - dimensional type ( i.e.  dual to a marked subdivision where all points are marked , i.e.  those which can be drawn through @xmath11 generic points ( see subsection [ subsec - hypersurf ] ) .",
    "if their dual subdivision is generic ( i.e.  it corresponds to a cone of codimension one of the secondary fan , see [ subsec - hypersurf ] ) , such tropical surfaces have only finitely many singularities .",
    "we classify the possible locations of singular points .",
    "our study is closely related to @xcite , which deals with singular tropical hypersurfaces of any dimension . there , a more algebraic point of view is taken however : the main result is the description of tropical singular points in terms of euler derivatives , i.e.  tropical equations are given which a point must satisfy to be singular .",
    "we concentrate more on the geometry of singular tropical surfaces .",
    "our paper can be viewed as a sequel to @xcite , where we studied tropical plane curves with a singular point .",
    "the main result of @xcite is the classification of singular tropical curves of maximal - dimensional type .",
    "a singular point of a tropical curve of maximal - dimensional type is either a `` crossing '' of two edges , or a three - valent vertex of multiplicity @xmath12 , or it is a point on an edge @xmath13 of weight two which has equal distance to the two vertices of @xmath13 ( or which satisfies a similar metric condition respectively ) . to derive this result",
    ", we used the following methods : we considered the family of algebraic curves in a toric surface with a singularity in a fixed point .",
    "this family is defined by linear equations , and so its tropicalisation is a bergman fan which can be described in terms of weight classes of flags of flats of the corresponding matroid ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we studied the possible weight classes and classified the corresponding tropical curves . fixing a different point in the torus yields a shift of the bergman fan ( see remark 3.1 and 3.2 of @xcite ) .    here",
    ", we apply the same methods to the family of algebraic surfaces in a toric threefold with a singularity in a fixed point .",
    "while the basic ideas we use are the same as in @xcite , the classification becomes much more complicated and we have to establish and use various facts about lattice polytopes . also , we concentrate purely on tropical surfaces with only finitely many singularities ( contrary to our classification in the curve case in @xcite ) .",
    "our main result is the classification in theorem [ thm2 ] below .",
    "such a classification is not possible in higher dimensions ( see remark [ rem - discrim ] ) .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] tells us for which tropical surfaces there are only finitely many singularities . for more details and notation ,",
    "see section [ sec - class ] .",
    "[ thm1 ] let @xmath14 be a non - degenerate convex lattice polytope and denote by @xmath15 the lattice points of @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath16 define a generic ( see definition [ def - generic1 ] ) singular tropical hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "assume the dual marked subdivision corresponds to a cone of codimension @xmath17 in the secondary fan .",
    "then the set of singular points in @xmath2 is a union of finitely many polyhedra of dimension @xmath18 .    in the following classification below , we thus want to restrict to the case @xmath19 of tropical surfaces @xmath2 whose dual marked subdivision corresponds to a cone of codimension @xmath20 in the secondary fan .",
    "it follows that the dual marked subdivision contains a unique circuit and that every marked polytope in the subdivision which does not contain the circuit is a simplex ( see remark [ rem - circuit ] ) .",
    "we can conclude from lemma 3.1 of @xcite that every singular point of @xmath2 is contained in the cell of @xmath2 dual to the circuit .",
    "in addition , we make the assumption that the tropical surface is of maximal - dimensional type , i.e.  that all lattice points are marked in the dual subdivision .",
    "this assumption is natural and gives us more control over the possible locations of the singular point .",

    "however , if    we define the multiplicity of a vertex of a tropical hypersurface    analogously to the case of tropical curves as the lattice volume of    the corresponding polytope in the dual subdivision , then it follows    that @xmath25 is a vertex of higher multiplicity .",
