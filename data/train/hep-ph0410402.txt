    "a general feature of the different theories extending the standard model of elementary particles ( sm ) is that new interactions involving heavy elementary objects and mass scales should exist , and manifest themselves _ via _ deviations of measured observables from the sm predictions . while for the supersymmetric extensions of the sm , there is confidence that the new particles could be be directly produced and their properties studied , in numerous other cases , such as",
    "the composite models of fermions@xcite and the exchange of leptoquarks,@xcite existing limits indicate that the heavy states could not be produced even at the highest energy supercolliders and , correspondingly , only `` virtual '' effects can be expected .",
    "a description of the relevant new interaction in terms of `` effective '' contact - interaction ( ci ) is most appropriate in these cases . of course",
    ", since different interactions can give rise to similar deviations from the sm predictions , the problem is to identify , from a hypothetically measured deviation , the kind of new dynamics underlying it .    in the context of the hierarchy problem ,",
    "much attention has been given in the past few years to the different scenarios involving extra space dimensions and their manifestations at high energy electron - positron and proton-(anti)proton colliders .",
    "of particular relevance is the problem of differentiating their signals from other sources of new phenomena .",
    "we shall here discuss the possibility of distinguishing such effects of extra dimensions from other np scenarios in lepton pair production at the lhc : @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "two specific models involving extra dimensions will be considered , namely the add@xcite and rs@xcite scenarios .    in",
    "the add scenario,@xcite gravity is allowed to propagate in two or more compactified extra space dimensions , with up to millimeter size @xmath6 . in four dimensions , this mechanism is equivalent to the exchange of a tower of equally mass - separated kaluza - klein ( kk ) spin-2 states , with @xmath7 .",
    "the relation between the higher - dimensional planck scale @xmath8 and the four - dimensional planck scale @xmath9 is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of extra dimensions .",
    "the sum over the ( almost continuous ) spectrum of kk states ( of mass @xmath12 ) can be expressed as : @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a sign factor , @xmath15 is newton s constant , and @xmath0 is the cutoff scale , expected to be of the order of the tev scale .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : hewett ] ) can be considered as an effective interaction at the scale @xmath0 .",
    "we will limit ourselves to the simplest version of the rs scenario,@xcite with only one extra dimension . differently from the add scenario",
    ", there will be narrow graviton spin-2 resonances with masses of the order of tev and coupling strength comparable to weak interactions .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum of kk gravitons in the tower are unequally spaced , as being located at the bessel zeros @xmath16 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the kk coupling strength .",
    "this model has two independent parameters , conveniently taken to be @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant of @xmath22 , and @xmath20 is the mass of the first graviton resonance .",
    "also , the phenomenology is quite different from that of the add scenario , in the sense that rs resonances may well be in the energy range of the lhc , and hence show up as peaks in the cross section .",
    "in the sm , lepton pairs can at hadron colliders be produced at tree - level via the following parton - level process @xmath24 now , if gravity can propagate in extra dimensions , the possibility of kk graviton exchange opens up two tree - level channels in addition to the sm channels , namely @xmath25 where @xmath26 represents the gravitons of the kk tower .",
    "the center  edge and total cross sections can at the parton level be defined like for initial - state electrons and positrons:@xcite @xmath27 \\frac{d\\hat \\sigma}{dz}\\ , dz , \\quad \\hat \\sigma \\equiv \\int_{-1}^{1 }   \\frac{d\\hat \\sigma}{dz}\\ , dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the angle , in the c.m .",
    "frame of the two leptons , between the lepton and the proton . here , @xmath30 is a parameter which defines the border between the `` center '' and the `` edge '' regions .",
    "this asymmetry has been demonstrated very selective to the add effects in the electron - positron case,@xcite and we want to test its use in the more complicated ( but experimentally forthcoming ) subprocesses ( [ eq : qqbar - sm ] ) and ( [ eq : qqbar - gg ] ) .    the center ",
    "edge asymmetry can then for a given dilepton invariant mass @xmath31 be defined as @xmath32 where a convolution over parton momenta is performed , and we obtain @xmath33 and @xmath34 from the inclusive differential cross sections @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , by integrating over @xmath37 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - hat - ce ] ) and over rapidity @xmath38 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , with @xmath41.@xcite    for the sm contribution to the center ",
    "edge asymmetry , the convolution integrals , depending on the parton distribution functions , cancel , and one finds@xcite @xmath42 this result is thus independent of the dilepton mass @xmath31 , and identical to the result for @xmath43 colliders.@xcite hence , in the case of no cuts on the angular integration , there is a unique value , @xmath44 , for which @xmath45 vanishes , corresponding to @xmath46 .",
    "the sm center - edge asymmetry of eq .  ( [ eq : acespin1 ] ) is equally valid for a wide variety of np models : composite - like contact interactions , @xmath47 models , tev - scale gauge bosons , _",
    "etc_. however , if graviton exchange is possible , the graviton tensor couplings would yield a different angular distribution , leading to a different dependence of @xmath23 on @xmath48 . in this case , the center  edge asymmetry would not vanish for the above choice of @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , it would show a non - trivial dependence on @xmath31 .",
    "thus , a value for @xmath23 different from @xmath45 would indicate non - vector - exchange np .",
    "another important difference from the sm case is that the graviton also couples to gluons , and therefore it has the additional @xmath50 initial state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qqbar - gg ] ) available . in summary",
    "then , including graviton exchange and also experimental cuts relevant to the lhc detectors , the center  edge asymmetry is no longer the simple function of @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : acespin1]).@xcite",
    "we assume now that a deviation from the sm is discovered in the cross section , either in the form of a ci or a resonance",
    ". we will here investigate in which regions of the add and rs parameter spaces such a deviation can be _ identified _ as being caused by spin-2 exchange .",
    "more precisely , we will see how the center ",
    "edge asymmetry ( [ eq : ace ] ) can be used to exclude spin-1 exchange interactions beyond that of the sm . at the lhc , with luminosity @xmath51 and @xmath52 , we require the invariant lepton mass @xmath53  gev and divide the data into @xmath54  gev bins as long as the number of events in each bin , @xmath55 , is larger than 10 . here",
    ", @xmath56 is the experimental reconstruction efficiency and @xmath57 the cross section in bin @xmath58 . to compute cross sections we use the cteq6 parton distributions.@xcite",
    "we impose angular cuts relevant to the lhc detectors .",
    "the lepton pseudorapidity cut is @xmath59 for both leptons , and in addition to the angular cuts , we impose on each lepton a transverse momentum cut @xmath60 .    from a conventional @xmath61 analysis we find the add - scenario _ identification _",
    "reach on @xmath62 at the lhc summarized in table  1 . in this table",
    "we also include the identification reach obtained from the analysis of the center - edge asymmetry performed at an @xmath43 linear collider ( lc ) for c.m . energy 500  gev .       as displayed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : randall ] ) , in the rs scenario the resonances are unevenly spaced .",
    "if the first resonance is sufficiently heavy , the second resonance would be difficult to resolve within the kinematical range allowed experimentally at the lhc , and we shall now consider this situation .",
    "we choose a 200  gev bin around the rs resonance mass @xmath20 , and obtain the results presented in fig .  1 , where we display the 2 , 3 and @xmath63 contours for @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "as shown in this figure , the identification reach at the lhc provided by the observable @xmath66 covers a large portion of the `` theoretically preferred '' ( in order not to create additional hierarchies ) parameter space @xmath67 tev . for @xmath68 , the @xmath69 identification reach extends above @xmath70 ( at the @xmath71 level ) .      in conclusion , we have considered the add scenario parametrized by @xmath0 , and the rs scenario parametrized by @xmath20 and @xmath72 .",
    "although somewhat higher sensitivity reaches on @xmath0 or @xmath20 than obtained here are given by other approaches , this method based on @xmath23 is suitable for actually _ pinning down _ the spin-2 nature of the kk gravitons up to very high @xmath0 or @xmath20 .",
    "this is different from just detecting deviations from the standard model predictions , and is a way to obtain additional information on the underlying new - physics scenario and to impose stringent constraints on the extra dimension scenarios here discussed .",
    "therefore , the analysis sketched here can potentially represent a valuable method complementary to the direct fit to the angular distribution of the lepton pairs.@xcite also , the analysis can readily be extended to other final states , in high energy proton - proton collisions , different from @xmath73 in ( [ proc ] ) , such as di - photon or di - jet final states .",
