    "in our previous paper @xcite , we reported a monte carlo calculation of thermodynamic properties of low - density neutron matter by using nuclear effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite .",
    "as pairing in neutron matter is strong , neutron matter is a strongly correlated fermionic system .",
    "we firmly established that low - density neutron matter is in the state of bcs - bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) crossover @xcite instead of a bcs - like state , the standard description in nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "the crossover state of low - density neutron matter is actually an expected one from studies of the bcs - bec crossover over the past decade .",
    "the pairing strength of an attractively interacting ( therefore unstable ) fermion system is characterized by a product of the two physical parameters , the fermi momentum @xmath1 and the ( @xmath5-wave ) scattering length @xmath2 @xcite . in terms of @xmath6 , the state of the bcs limit",
    "is realized at @xmath7 , that of the bec limit at @xmath8 , and that of the unitary limit at @xmath9 .",
    "( we use the sign convention @xmath10 for fermions attractively interacting with no bound state . ) a fermion pair at the limit forms a zero - energy bound state , thereby yielding an infinitely long scattering length . because the infinitely long scattering length generates no classical scale , the fermion system composed of the pairs",
    "is expected to have a universal feature . in recent years , much attention has been paid to the physics at the unitary limit in the fields of both condensed matter and atomic physics ; for example , refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein .",
    "the @xmath3 neutron - neutron scattering length is negative and large in magnitude , @xmath11 fm @xcite . for a density of about @xmath12 ( @xmath13 @xmath14 is the nuclear matter density )",
    ", @xmath15 takes the value of @xmath16 furthermore , the neutron matter of the above density is well described by the eft lattice hamiltonian that is identical to the attractive hubbard model @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ etaldnm ] ) thus suggests that the physics of low - density neutron matter would be similar to that of the unitary limit .",
    "note that the similarity is expected only in the limited range of the density . for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 )",
    ", neutron matter would be in more of a bcs state in this quite low density . for @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , the physics of neutron matter",
    "is much affected by the next - order ( repulsive ) term in the eft potential , and deviates from that of the unitary limit .",
    "physically , neutron matter never reaches the unitary limit @xmath21 .",
    "but our previous monte carlo results at the leading - order ( lo ) @xcite are based on the hubbard model with the parameter values chosen ( translated from @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) to be suitable for neutron matter . a monte carlo calculation of a fermion system at the unitary limit",
    "could be carried out by repeating our neutron - matter calculation but with the parameter values adjusted to the limit .",
    "this approach has been used by lee @xcite , based on the lagrangian formalism . while it may appear to be a straight - forward application , the computation is quite time consuming . instead , by exploiting the proximity of low - density neutron matter to the unitary limit ,",
    "we follow here another procedure originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , an extrapolation to the unitary limit from low - density neutron matter by use of our previous monte carlo results at the lo .",
    "the underlying assumption in this procedure is that the physical quantities of interest are , at least numerically , slowly varying functions of @xmath15 and smoothly reachable to the unitary limit , as eq .",
    "( [ etaldnm ] ) suggests . as will be seen in secs .",
    "iii and iv , we find that this is indeed the case .",
    "the quantities examined are the ground - state energy @xmath22 , the pairing gap at @xmath23 @xmath24 , and the critical temperature of the normal - to - superfluid phase transition @xmath25 , all of which are made to be dimensionless by taking ratios with @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the neutron mass ) .",
    "note that only @xmath1 provides a classical dimension at the unitary limit in the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction .",
    "ii briefly summarizes our computational method , which will help keep the discussions in later sections coherent . in secs .",
    "iii , iv , and v , we describe the extrapolation procedure of @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively . the description of @xmath22 in sec .",
    "iii is somewhat detailed , since this quantity was not examined in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "our conclusion is found in sec .",
    "the neutron - neutron ( @xmath28 ) interaction in the eft lagrangian includes all possible terms allowed by symmetries of the underlying theory of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 potential is in the momentum expansion form @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the @xmath28 center - of - mass momenta , and @xmath32 is the regularization scale . for a description of low - density neutron matter , we use a truncated potential including only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eftpot ] ) .",
    "the truncated eft hamiltonian on a three - dimensional cubic lattice @xmath33 then takes the form of the three - dimensional attractive hubbard - model hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lattice spacing , @xmath36 is the hopping parameter ( @xmath27 , the neutron mass ) , and @xmath37 denotes a restriction on the sum of all neighboring pairs . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the creation and annihilation operators of the neutron , respectively ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 is the number operator with the spin @xmath42 at the @xmath43 site .    the lattice spacing @xmath35 is directly related to @xmath32 as @xmath44 @xmath32 should be set larger than the momentum scale , below which the truncated form of the potential is valid @xcite .",
    "@xmath32 can be chosen to be smaller but should be at least @xmath45 for the momentum @xmath46 at which the physics is studied @xcite . in our case , we take @xmath47 , because the momentum scale corresponding to the excitation energy of interest is much less .    the eft parameter @xmath48 in the lattice regularization with the finite lattice spacing @xmath35 is given as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a form of watson s triple integral @xcite , with @xmath51 denoting the principal value of the integral . at the unitary limit ( @xmath52 ) , we have @xmath53 which agrees with the value found in the literature @xcite .    in our monte carlo calculation at the lo @xcite",
    ", we carried out an extensive monte carlo lattice calculation for the standard parameter set , which consists of the three values of the neutron matter density @xmath54 with the lattice filling ( or the site - occupation fraction ) @xmath55 set to be 1/4 .",
    "the reasoning underlying this choice is somewhat involved , and we refer the reader to our previous paper @xcite . here , @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the lattice size ( the total number of the three - dimensional lattice sites ) .",
    "note that in this work , we specify the density of the interacting fermion system , @xmath54 , using @xmath1 through the relation @xmath58 . we emphasize that @xmath54 here is an expectation value obtained by our monte carlo calculation , as eq .",
