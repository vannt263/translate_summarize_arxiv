    "over the coming decade , the detection of cosmic neutrinos is both an exciting prospect and a challenge .",
    "the considerable efforts deployed towards its realization are made worthwhile by the potential to add to our knowledge , both of the astrophysics of high energy sources and of physics beyond the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the extant and forthcoming @xmath5 sized facilities  @xcite may detect high - energy neutrinos from sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and gamma ray bursts ( grb ) , heralding a new chapter in neutrino physics . specifically ,",
    "if such neutrinos are observed , their intensity and spectrum would provide key information towards understanding the dynamics of their source objects .",
    "they may also shed light on the origin of the observed cosmic rays . additionally , flavor ratios for the three types of neutrinos may provide insights into new physics beyond the standard model , e.g. , neutrino decay , the presence of pseudo - dirac mass states and cpt violation  @xcite .",
    "the expected flux ratio @xmath6 in many sources is very sensitive to the existence of these effects .",
    "if a significant deviation from the resulting democratic distribution @xmath7 expected at earth - based detectors ( after oscillation effects are incorporated ) @xcite is reconstructed from the observations , it would be a clear signal of new physics .",
    "an unresolved issue which is expected to significantly affect the emitted and observed neutrino fluxes and their ratios is the role played by charm meson production and subsequent decay .",
    "such mesons are significantly short - lived compared to @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons , which are copiously produced in the @xmath10 and @xmath0 interactions which typify almost all such sources .",
    "this results in the charm meson neutrino spectrum in high energy astrophysical sources having qualitatively different features .",
    "specifically , their decay is expected to lead to relatively flatter and elongated neutrino spectra compared to the sharply dropping contribution from @xmath8 and @xmath9 decays .",
    "this leads to an enhancement of higher energy neutrinos in sources where charm plays a role , as shown recently in  @xcite",
    ". ratios of fluxes , which as stated above , are important diagnostics of new physics , would also be altered , since charm decay produces equal numbers of muon and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "while these effects may not be important in all high energy sources , they could significantly alter the observed neutrino fluxes for a class of sources which are characterized by proton rich jets , or , in general , an environment which renders @xmath0 interactions important .",
    "it is our intent in this paper to examine the observational consequences for ultra high energy detectors for this class of sources , where charm mesons are produced in significant numbers , along with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "our aim is to bring out general qualitative differences which would stand out as markers for the presence of charm production via @xmath0 interactions in the source .",
    "if observed , this would also shed light on the issue of the presence and relative importance of @xmath0 interactions versus @xmath10 interactions .",
    "as a specific case in point , to facilitate quantitative estimates of event rates from which conclusions may be drawn , we choose as source slow - jet supernovae ( sjs ) , which have been the focus of recent studies  @xcite .",
    "however , several important features related to observations which emerge from our calculations for sjs may be generic to other types of sources whose jets are baryon rich .    to this end",
    ", we calculate the event rates using the fluxes given in  @xcite .",
    "this is done both for a single sjs source and for the diffuse flux obtained by summing over sources . while it was shown in  @xcite that a nearby source ( at around @xmath11 mpc )",
    "is observable via its neutrinos from @xmath8 and @xmath9 decay , we show that the charm , or prompt component adds substantially to the neutrino event rate at energies significantly above those spanned by the conventional flux .",
    "additionally , we find that due to the charmed - meson contribution , the diffuse flux from sjs alone can rise above the atmospheric neutrino background , and may already be constrained by the amanda observations  @xcite",
    ". it must be noted , however , that flux estimates of high energy sources , though usually underpinned by reliable physics , have inherent uncertainties .",
    "this is more so in the case of charm contributions , with their added qcd - related uncertainty .",
    "the event numbers we compute are intended to serve as estimates , whereas the qualitative observational features which are pointed out here , distinguishing the presence of charm contributions , may , in the long run , serve as more useful diagnostic tools as experiments accumulate data over the next decade .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we briefly review the physics of sjs supplemented by charm meson production .",
    "we discuss the qualitative features of the flux and , for practical use , give its fitting functions .",
    "we then calculate the event rates and spectrum in an icecube - like detector .",
    "in section 3 , we obtain the diffuse flux and associated event rate by summing up all contributions from sjs point sources .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a discussion of our results and conclusions .",
    "since the discovery of the connections between long duration grb and supernovae  @xcite , it has been conjectured that a significant fraction of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) may be accompanied by mildly relativistic jets which do not break through the stellar envelope .",
    "the choked jet may give rise to a radio after - glow without prompt @xmath12 ray signals , and such objects may be detectable primarily only via their neutrino emission . the neutrino spectrum resulting from this scenario",
    "was first modeled by razzaque , m@xmath13sz@xmath14ros , and waxman ( rmw )  @xcite and extended by ando and beacom ( ab )  @xcite .",
    "the essential difference between sjs and the related grb jets is the mild gamma factor of the former , @xmath15 and its baryon rich environment which makes @xmath0 collisions efficient .",
    "an extension of the work in  @xcite has recently been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "these authors calculate the neutrino flux from charm meson production and decay in the source , by solving the cascade equations which describe the propagation of protons and mesons .",
    "the proton rich environment inside the slow jets is naturally conducive to charm production via @xmath0 interactions .",
    "daughter neutrinos from charmed mesons typically have energies higher than those resulting from conventional ones .",
    "these mesons decay quickly , producing @xmath16 , before significant energy loss via interactions can occur , so that their contribution to the neutrino flux becomes dominant at @xmath17 .",
    "this result is a significant change in the overall features of the emergent neutrino flux and , to an extent , in its flavor composition .    in general , meson spectra ,",
    "whose shapes are inherited by the daughter neutrinos , are characterized by two power - law energy breaking scales .",
    "the first breaking point @xmath18 is determined by the competition between decay and hadronic cooling ( the latter characterized by , for instance , @xmath19 and @xmath20 interactions ) .",
    "the second energy @xmath21 is determined by the transition between hadronic cooling and radiative cooling and marks the onset of the latter .",
    "below the first breaking energy , meson decay is dominant and the spectrum is the same as that of the shock accelerated protons , @xmath22 . between the first and the second scale , hadronic cooling is dominant , and the spectrum gets steepen to @xmath23 . above the second breaking energy , radiative cooling dominates , and",
    "the spectrum falls as @xmath24 up to the cutoff given by the proton maximal energy . for pions ,",
    "the two breaking energies are close to each other and relatively low ; @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus the pion flux retains an @xmath27 power over tev scales , up to the maximal cutoff energy . for kaons ,",
    "the relevant breaking energies are given by @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "for the charmed mesons @xmath30 and @xmath31 , due to their short lifetimes and large masses , the two scales are close to each other and have relatively high values , @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "thus the charmed flux maintains a @xmath33 power law all the way up to the proton maximal energy , leading to a significantly flatter spectrum .    in fig .",
    "[ fluxes1 ] , we show various fluxes of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos at an earth detector .",
    "the calculation uses rmw  @xcite , ab  @xcite and ers  @xcite source fluxes and propagates them to the earth for an assumed sjs source at a distance of @xmath34 mpc .",
    "the fluxes are shown without neutrino oscillation effects , which we discuss in a later sub - section .",
    "we note that the flux estimates for muon neutrinos from @xmath8 and @xmath9 differ in the three models , while exhibiting similar spectral shapes .",
    "the differences , in part , result from differing treatments of the maximal proton cutoff energies .    for the ers case",
    ", we also show the flux resulting from the incorporation of @xmath30-meson flux ( the curve for @xmath31 is similar to that for @xmath30 ) .",
    "we note that the ers-@xmath35 flux becomes dominant above @xmath36 .",
    "this flux , after propagation over a distance @xmath37 from the source at redshift @xmath38 is well represented by the following fitting function , @xmath39 , \\label{dfit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 similarly , for the conventional ers ( @xmath41 meson ) flux , we find @xmath42 where @xmath43 these expressions are useful not only for calculating the event numbers but also to deduce the diffuse flux , both of which we discuss below .",
    "the above fluxes do not accommodate the effect of the meson accelerations by the internal shock  @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that accounting for this acceleration and subsequent losses due to the increased lifetime and increased interactions would lower the ers flux estimates , and the event rate predictions we make in this paper for them .",
    "the neutrinos produced at a source can change flavors during propagation to earth .",
    "although their energies are very high , the distance between a source and a detector is also large enough to average out the oscillatory behavior .",
    "writing the vacuum transition probabilities between flavor eigenstates @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of the lepton mixing matrix @xmath46 only , we have  @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the solar angle in the standard parameterization for @xmath46 . the simple form of eq .",
    "( [ pvac ] ) is a result of setting the `` reactor '' and `` atmospheric '' mixing angles as @xmath50 and @xmath51 respectively . as a consequence of this maximal @xmath52-@xmath53 mixing",
    ", the flux ratio of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at earth must be 1 .",
    "in addition , the standard ratio @xmath56 at a source means results in a democratic configuration @xmath57 at a detector , independent of the value of @xmath49 .    for sjs ,",
    "the environment is baryon rich and muons lose their energy before decaying .",
    "thus , for the pion and kaon fluxes , the initial configurations are @xmath58 . on the other hand , charmed mesons decay semi - leptonically such that the initial ratio is @xmath59 . according to eq .",
    "( [ pvac ] ) , these initial fluxes at the source will be transmuted to @xmath60 and @xmath61 at earth , where we have used @xmath62 as a current best fit value @xcite . to summarize , we note the fluxes eq .",
    "( [ dfit ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cfit ] ) after oscillation are given by @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , denoting the flavor species by upper subscripts .",
    "the difference of the initial flavor ratio between the prompt and the conventional fluxes and their different spectral behavior gives rise to an energy dependent flavor ratio at earth .",
    "this is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 stand for generic charm and conventional fluxes .",
    "the ratio is bounded as follows , @xmath69 by the high and low - energy asymptotic behavior , marked by the dominance of the prompt and the conventional component respectively .",
    "the energy dependence is most significant around the energy at which the prompt and conventional components are equal .",
    "we show the behavior of the ratio eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) by the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ emur ] , by plotting the prompt and conventional flux eq .",
    "( [ dfit ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cfit ] ) at @xmath70 mpc .",
    "of course , this remains unaltered when we compute the diffuse flux by integrating over the distribution and luminosity of sources , since it depends only on the mixing matrix and the fact that the oscillation length is much shorter than the source distance .",
    "[ emur ] highlights the importance of detecting both electron and muon flavored neutrinos , particularly in the high - energy region above @xmath71 tev .",
    "the rise of the ratio above unity at high - energy will be an indication that charmed mesons contribute to neutrino production .",
    "in addition , the observation of the transition of the ratio around @xmath72 tev would indicate that the source environments are baryon rich , to a degree that allows the charm component to rise above the conventional @xmath1 component and the muon to be damped .",
    "we also note the significant difference in the sjs without charm and sjs with charm curves in the figure , i.e from a constant @xmath73 for the former , to an energy dependant transition from @xmath73 to @xmath74 for the latter .",
    "thus , shower events would register an increase from their low values compared to muon events at low energies , and rise above them at high energies .",
    "we note that the canonical flavor ratio @xmath56 , the ratio for muon damped sources , @xmath58 and that for semi - leptonic @xmath35 decay , @xmath59 should all be regarded as idealizations which can be used as first approximations .",
    "more precisely , there can be small deviations from the above standard ratios with some uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been discussed that the muon damping can not be perfect and @xmath75 component consequently never can fall to zero  @xcite .",
    "inclusion of these effects will amount to finite thickness for the curves presented in fig .",
    "however , qualitative behavior such as the transition of the ratio around @xmath72 tev will not change significantly and the curves in fig .",
    "[ emur ] still represent the essential qualitative physics of the charm effect .",
    ".the number of up - going @xmath76 events from an sjs at @xmath11 mpc .",
    "the columns show the events in each decade of energy ( in gev ) and the total events .",
    "an instrumented volume of @xmath77 , and an energy threshold @xmath78 ( gev ) is assumed . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the production and decay of charmed mesons can play an important role for the detection of high - energy cosmic neutrinos .",
    "slow - jet supernovae provide both an excellent example and a test case in which the charm effect can be significant due to the baryon rich environment , leading to the rise of @xmath0 contributions to the total neutrino rate .",
    "this enhances the detectability of the sjs neutrinos not only with the point sources but also with the diffuse flux .",
    "the charm contribution appears to open up the possibility of detecting sjs via their diffuse flux , using the ers flux calculations . while the absolute intensity of the flux should be regarded with caution at the present stage , the elongated shape of the total flux offers a shot at detection , provided @xmath0 interactions play a significant role , and if the the jet parameters ( and the faction @xmath79 ) are favorable .    by virtue of the semileptonic decay of the charmed mesons ,",
    "the flavor ratio @xmath80 must be @xmath81 , which is essentially different from the typical agn or grb case .",
    "furthermore , the energy dependence of @xmath80 also carries potentially important information .",
    "the ratio shifts occurs around the crossing point @xmath82 where the @xmath35-meson flux becomes equal to the kaon flux .",
    "the crossing energy is written as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 are the kaon and the charmed - meson multiplicities , and @xmath85 is the first breaking energy for kaon .",
    "the breaking energy @xmath85 is very sensitive to the bulk lorentz factor @xmath86 such that @xmath87 depending on the assumption on the jet - opening angle  @xcite .    to summarize",
    ", charmed mesons can play an important role in a certain class of high energy sources in general and some supernovae in particular , where jets are mildly relativistic and environments baryon - rich .",
    "detection of the charm related neutrino flux may be possible with current and near - future detector sensitivities , and can offer a valuable handle on several important open questions related to the dynamics of such sources .",
