    "this gaussian approximation is rather good .",
    "figure 8(c ) displays a contour plot of the phase of @xmath11 given by tan@xmath192 .",
    "the solid curve denotes the numerical results and the dashed curve is obtained from the ansatz eq .",
    "these figures imply that the ansatz is unsatisfactory , although a gaussian approximation might be suitable .    , and 7 as a function of @xmath149 for @xmath182 . ]",
    "we have studied the distance @xmath117 as a function of @xmath149 when @xmath182 in the two - vortex , four - vortex , and seven - vortex systems studied in  3 .",
    "figure 9 displays the distances between the nearest - neighboring vortices in systems with @xmath193 , and 7 .",
    "the vortex patterns are stable only in small parameter regions with small values of @xmath149 .",
    "the stable parameter region for @xmath116 is particularly small .",
    "figure 9 suggests that the vortex number @xmath46 increases with @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath149 is increased beyond the critical value on the right , the vortex nucleation occurs from the surface - mode instability and the vortex number increases .",
    "when @xmath149 is decreased beyond the critical value on the left , vortices disappear as a result of the symmetry - breaking instabilities . the vortex patterns with different @xmath46 are multi stable in overlapping parameter regions .",
    "these behaviors are similar to the case of @xmath105 studied in  3 .",
    "however , we have not succeeded in evaluating the distance between the nearest - neighboring vortices theoretically , because a suitable ansatz for the wave function other than eqs .",
    "( 15 ) or ( 16 ) has not been found yet .",
    "note that the @xmath149 dependence of distance @xmath117 does not appear in the point - vortex theory .",
    "we have proposed a type of ginzburg - landau equation . using the model equation , we can efficiently find stable vortex patterns in rotating bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we have found that multiple - vortex patterns are stable at the same frequency @xmath5 for @xmath105 .",
    "we have also found that symmetry - breaking instabilities occur for vortex patterns , which lead the annihilation of vortices .",
    "the symmetry - breaking instabilities are qualitatively consistent with those obtained by the point - vortex theory , but the critical values are considerably different .",
    "it is left to a future study to estimate the critical values by taking the effects of the harmonic potential and the finite core size into consideration .",
    "the forces from the mirror images are essential for the symmetry - breaking instabilities in the point - vortex theory . from the analogy with the point - vortex system , we think that the confinement effect due to the harmonic potential is very important for causing the symmetry - breaking instabilities in the ginzburg - landau type equation .",
    "we have verified that symmetry - breaking instabilities also occur in a type of complex ginzburg - landau equation when the energy dissipation is small .",
    "spiral - like trajectories have been numerically obtained , although the trajectories are rather complicated .",
    "we expect that such spiral - like trajectories of vortices might be observed in real experiments .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the point - vortex theory and the numerical simulation at @xmath105 was not satisfactory . in the limit of large @xmath149 ,",
    "the core size of a vortex becomes infinitesimal , because the core size is scaled as @xmath150 for large @xmath149 from an argument based on the scale transformation .",
    "this is intuitively because the stronger repulsive interaction for larger @xmath149 makes the density @xmath194 more uniform and therefore the core size smaller .",
    "the point - vortex approximation is therefore expected to improve in the case of large @xmath149 .",
    "we have also performed a numerical simulation near the l - l - l regime , where @xmath179 and @xmath149 is sufficiently small in contrast to the limit of the point - vortex approximation when @xmath195 . we have found stable vortex patterns with @xmath193 , and 7 , when @xmath149 is sufficiently small .",
    "the single vortex is well approximated by eq .",
    "( 14 ) ; however , the ansatz eq .",
    "( 16 ) is not satisfactory for a two - vortex system .",
    "it is left to future studies to find a better approximation of @xmath11 in this parameter range and obtain a theoretical value for the distances among vortices .",
