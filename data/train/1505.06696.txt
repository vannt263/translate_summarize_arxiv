    "nonlinear optics has become an intensive research area in physics after the discovery of the laser by townes _",
    "et al . _ in 1955 [ 1 ] and theoretical study of harmonic generation by several seminal papers of bloembergen _ et al . _",
    "[ 2 , 3 ] in 1962 .",
    "one of the most intensely studied nonlinear optic phenomena is the generation of higher harmonics with frequency @xmath1 known as second harmonic generation ( shg ) first investigated by franken _",
    "et al . _ in 1961 [ 4 ] . the discovery of third harmonic generation soon followed by maker and terhune [ 5 ] and subsequently by ward [ 6 ] .",
    "bloembergen and coworkers reported a study on the phenomena of electric field induced second harmonic ( efish ) generation [ 7 ] and afterwards several efforts , both theoretically [ 8 ] and also experimentally [ 9 - 11 ] have been performed to understand the physics of efish .",
    "some interesting results include the experimental determination of the hyperpolarizabilities for glass [ 11 ] and the separation of the bulk and surface nonlinear contributions [ 9 ] .",
    "efish is generated by a direct current ( dc ) static field that produces a potential gradient which breaks the initial symmetry of the inversion symmetric material .",
    "therefore the nonlinear polarization due to efish is characterized by a fourth rank susceptibility tensor @xmath2 .    to the best of our knowledge efish",
    "has never been analyzed from the view point of the simplified bond hyperpolarizability model ( sbhm ) and group theory ( gt ) altogether , even though the model has been able to successfully predict shg experimental results of si surfaces / interfaces [ 12 - 14 ] .",
    "the sbhm advantage is that the model can describe shg generated by a silicon ( si ) surface with only two fitting parameter [ 13 ] which is rather different from the standard tensorial approach [ 15 ] . in our recent work [ 16 ]",
    "we have also demonstrated how sbhm and gt are related for several crystal orientations such as si(111 ) , si(001 ) , and si(011 ) and here we expand sbhm to include thg and efish .    in the merit of this objective , this work is organized as follows : in section ii we discuss group theory results concerning the fourth rank tensor that describes third order nonlinear interactions particularly thg and efish . in section",
    "iii we derive the corresponding tensor using the sbhm and compare it with gt .",
    "we show in section iv that due to symmetry breaking in si(001 ) and si(111 ) facets , the resulting group of symmetry can be explained and interpreted by an effective third rank tensor . in section",
    "v , a sbhm simulation is applied to fit the mos experiment in ref .",
    "additionally , a classical , _ ab initio _ efish model is presented in section vi .",
    "finally , the conclusions of this work are briefly stated .",
    "contrary to sbhm , which is basically a phenomenological model to calculate the nonlinear response of a medium , group theory is a mathematical logical construction that can be applied to investigate the symmetry operations allowed by a crystal . because the physics must be the same upon coordinate transformation , the crystal properties , including the ( long wavelength ) optical ones , must remain unchanged under symmetry operations .",
    "due to specific crystal orientation , only certain rotations and mirror planes exist .",
    "it is well known that rotations and reflections can be represented mathematically by matrices .",
    "the set of matrices , which contains all the rotations and mirror planes allowed for a particular crystal , is called a point group .    in general , a third - order nonlinear polarization has the form [ 17 ] : @xmath3 where the subindex in the frequencies denote that they can be different . according to group theory , the fourth rank tensor @xmath4 for bulk silicon in eq .",
    "( 1 ) belongs to a well known point group symmetry labelled @xmath5 .",
    "the explicit fourth rank tensor for this group of symmetry is similar to the tensor given in refs .",
    "[ 18 , 19 ] : @xmath6 therefore , a general fourth rank tensor has in total @xmath7 elements .",
    "the four rank tensor in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , consists of a @xmath8 matrix , where each component of the matrix consist of @xmath9 matrix elements .",
    "as will be shown later , not all components are independent [ 18 , 19 ] . for clarity ,",
    "the notation used for representing the fourth rank tensor is explained here .",
    "the first index `` @xmath10 '' in @xmath11 corresponds to the rows and the second index `` @xmath12 '' to the columns in the main matrix ( the external one ) .",
    "it follows then that all the elements in the first row and first column of the external @xmath8 matrix have @xmath13 indices , whereas for the second row and third column of the external matrix it will be @xmath14 and so on . in the same way",
    "the indices `` @xmath15 '' and `` @xmath16 '' will correspond to the usual way of labeling a @xmath9 matrix , namely the rows and columns in the inner @xmath17 matrix respectively .    * as proven in refs . [ 18 - 21 ] for three possible different frequencies , the fourth rank tensor for @xmath5 has at most 4 independent elements * but in special physical cases could be reduced to 3 [ 18 ] . however , for a rotating sample , the tensor needs to be correctly rotated using the following procedure [ 18 ] : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rotation matrix .",
    "one then obtains for a rotation @xmath20 along the @xmath21-axis the following tensor in its most general form : @xmath22    where @xmath23      for the case of third harmonic generation ( thg ) as long as only a monochromatic frequency is used the nonlinear polarization in eq .",
    "( 1 ) takes a simpler form : @xmath24 where the fields labeled with ",
    "@xmath12 `` , `` @xmath15 '' and `` @xmath16 '' are now undistinguishable .",
    "because the fields are the same they can not be distinguished by the experimenter and the tensor can be ' ' symmetrized \" .",
    "therefore it is allowed to perform intrinsic permutation of the last three indices [ 17 ] : @xmath25 when this permutation is performed on eq .",
    "( 2 ) we obtain the following tensor @xmath26 where @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "* therefore for thg the general tensor that previously consists of 4 independent components is now reduced to two independent components .",
    "*      we now consider the case of a static dc field along the @xmath21 axis , and assume one monochromatic incident field . the nonlinear polarization in eq . ( 1 ) for this particular situation",
    "can be stated as : @xmath29 where in this case `` @xmath16 '' has only the @xmath21 component different from zero .",
    "because of a monochromatic incident field the instrinsic permutation can again be applied for the two middle indices `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath15 '' resulting in the following tensor : @xmath30    where @xmath31 . *",
    "thus the fourth rank tensor describing efish consists of 3 independent elements*. one is tempted at this point to apply kleinman symmetry for the tensor in eq .",
    "( 9 ) where for the nonresonant condition the nonlinear susceptibility is independent of the frequency permutation and one can freely interchange all the tensor indices [ 17 ] .",
    "therefore we have @xmath32 and we now have only 2 independent components .",
    "there are however reports that such a treatment for efish can not always be performed [ 22 - 24 ] .",
    "sbhm is a classical phenomenological model first constructed by aspnes and coworkers that can be used to calculate the nonlinear response of anharmonic dipoles where , in its most simplified version , the electrons are assumed to oscillate only in the direction of the bonds [ 13 ] . in the case of nonlinear generation inside the bulk , the polarizabilities and hyperpolarizabilities for a monochromatic input field have the same value along all bond directions but to surface bonds , a different value is assigned due to symmetry breaking in one particular direction .",
    "however , symmetry breaking @xmath33 can also occur if there is a static electric field applied in some specific direction .",
    "let us consider the case where a monochromatic electric field is incoming on a si surface that is rotated along the @xmath21 axis . here , without a dc field , there are no shg contributions from two photon absorption or dipole contribution inside the bulk because the si atomic cell is centrosymmetric ( @xmath34 opposing bonds ) and therefore demands @xmath35 to be zero .",
    "however , there are several other mechanism that can generate second harmonic signals inside the bulk [ 14 ] , one of them is efish which breaks this centrosymmetricity and can be evaluated using sbhm .",
    "in fact , peng and aspnes [ 25 ] already describe thg using sbhm .",
    "they focus their analysis on the far field radiation , calculating and discussing in detail the resulting electric field while outlining the steps followed to get there through sbhm and therefore omitting the information richness that can be obtained from the tensorial description of the problem .",
    "they also showed that even if a transversal contribution from the bonds is considered , this contribution can be expressed as a constant multiplying the electric field plus exactly the same functional form of the contribution along the bonds .",
    "thus , for this reason , our analysis can be done only taking account of the contribution along the bonds . from the viewpoint of the sbhm",
    "the fourth rank tensor @xmath2 takes the form : @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the volume , @xmath38 are the third order hyperpolarizabilities , @xmath39 are the unit vectors in the direction of the atomic bonds , and @xmath40 is the rotation matrix about the @xmath21 axis . the summation is performed over all eight bonds which are needed to represent the correct response of the conventional cell . if there exist an applied external dc field along a particular direction e.g. in a metal oxide semiconductor ( mos ) structure [ 10 ] then the nonlinear polarization in eq .",
    "( 1 ) can be written as : @xmath41 where there are two electric fields oscillating at frequency @xmath42 and one static or dc field .    before going further , we are going to show that sbhm always generate a tensor with kleinman symmetry .",
    "indeed it can be shown e.g. using brute force by applying the most general bond vector components that the final tensor is always symmetric .",
    "this is due to the following fact : the tensor is generated by direct product of the same bonds @xmath43 and the hyperpolarizabilities in sbhm are just constants .",
    "it was already proven by mcgilp that sbhm has kleinman symmetry in the particular case of shg for surfaces [ 26 ] . here",
    ", our line of arguing is general and valid for any harmonic generation driven with a single driving frequency ( shg , thg , fhg , ... ) and applies for both bulk or surface . without loss of generality",
    ", we are going to take eq .",
    "( 10 ) only with the outer product of the vectors , therefore : @xmath44 which is a fourth rank tensor and in terms of its components can be expressed as : @xmath45 when the indices @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the fourth rank tensor @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( 13 ) are permuted , the bond components @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 are also permuted in the same way but because the components are just scalars the product result will always be the same .",
    "therefore any permutation of the subindices generates exactly the same tensor @xmath48 and this is kleinman symmetry .",
    "in addition , the tensorial product in eq .",
    "( 12 ) was derived from the one dimensional classical equation of motion in sbhm [ 13 ] which assumes motion only along the bonds or it was taken for granted that the electronic potential is very much aligned along the bonds and even if we wish to take account of the transversal contribution , as was mentioned before this is reduced to a constant multiplying the electric field plus the very same longitudinal contribution along the bonds [ 25 ] .",
    "we now proceed further to discuss the particular case of silicon .",
    "the diamond bond direction inside the si bulk consists of 8 vectors and the fixed system of reference can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . we choose for the orientation the `` standard '' conventional diamond cell because the corresponding material tensor for different crystallographic cells in refs .",
    "[ 18,19 ] is defined in this way and their representation changes when the sample is rotated .",
    "therefore we apply the following bond definition [ 16 ] : @xmath51 @xmath52 with opposing bonds : @xmath53    [ htbp ]     .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ]    using the sbhm method in obtaining the tensor ( eq .",

    "( 16 ) and eq .",
    "( 4 ) shows similarities in the tensor components .",
    "however , even though this procedure can in principle be done for a general angle @xmath20 , the result is very cumbersome .",
    "nevertheless , we can set @xmath56 and compare it with eq .",
    "( 7 ) : @xmath57    * it is straightforward to see from eq . (",
    "17 ) that the sbhm only demands 1 independent parameter which is the third order hyperpolarizability @xmath58*. in this way , the undetermined gt constants from the independent elements can be determined in terms of physical values . because the tensor in eq .",
    "( 17 ) is general , the bond model thus predicts that thg and efish can also be described by only one independent parameter .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , the group theory fourth rank tensor for thg and efish can be reduced , respectively , to only 2 and 3 independent parameters .",
    "therefore it is very possible that the independent tensor elements obtained by gt can be further reduced .",
    "it is now up to the experiment or an _ ab initio _ theory , to verify if this is generally true .",
    "in fact , we will show in section v , for the case of efish with a dc field along the @xmath21 axis how sbhm can fit experimental results using only one hyperpolarizability value .",
    "in this section , we argue further that shg due to a dc efish in a particular axis can also be described using a third rank tensor with an effective susceptibility .",
    "the argument is as follows : it is known that @xmath5 posseses one of the highest possible point group symmetries in gt .",
    "this group includes @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 axis , as well as , @xmath64 and @xmath65 mirror planes [ 18 , 21 ] .",
    "physically , the dc field in the direction normal to the [ 001 ] plane or along the @xmath21 axis , breaks the symmetry in the conventional cell : the electronic distribution is no longer the same in other directions and all the elements of symmetry that transforms in some way the @xmath21 coordinate are no longer allowed . for this reason ,",
    "only the axis with symmetry group @xmath59 and two vertical mirror planes remain : the resulting point group is @xmath66 .",
    "this symmetry breaking is very similar to the shg result obtained for a si(001 ) surface eventhough they are not exactly the same .",
    "the main difference is that for the si bulk two neighboring tetrahedral elements are required to model the response of the complete conventional cell whereas only one tetrahedral is required to describe the surface .",
    "therefore , the point group for this surface is @xmath67 , as we have discussed in our previous work [ 16 ] .",
    "based on this , we can contract the general efish tensor in eq .",
    "( 2 ) with a unitary vector in the @xmath21 direction due to the dc field alienation along this axis so that we obtain a third rank tensor associated with a si(001 ) direction : @xmath68 this third rank tensor can be understood as a @xmath69 matrix divided into three matrices with dimension @xmath8 . for a general third rank tensor ( `` @xmath10 '' , `` @xmath12 '' , `` @xmath15''@xmath70 ) ,",
    "the first index `` @xmath10 '' corresponds to the rows in the main matrix ( the external one ) .",
    "similarly , the indices `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath15 '' will correspond to the usual way of labeling a @xmath71 matrix , where the indices @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively the rows and columns in the inner @xmath71 matrix .",
    "moreover , for the third rank tensors and the case of shg , where the two fundamental driving fields are undistinguishable , we can again apply intrinsic permutation and therefore @xmath74 , which was already sugested by eq .",
    "furthermore , assuming symmetry in the diagonal of the contracted matrix representation [ 19 ] we have @xmath75 and again both efish and shg third rank tensor now only requires two independent parameters*.    we can compare eq . (",
    "18 ) with the sbhm tensor in eq .",
    "( 17 ) after contracting it with the dc field in @xmath21 direction : @xmath76 which gives the same form as eq .",
    "it has to be emphasized that for the case of efish the third order hyperpolarizability now takes the form @xmath77 and can generally differ from @xmath78 .",
    "however , if the electron movement can be described by * only one * resonator , and this is very probable below the band gap , the static efish polarizibility * has to be connected * to the @xmath79 , just applying an oscillator model . in section",
    "vi we will show how an expression for @xmath80 can be obtained from symmetry breaking of the atomic potential .",
    "furthermore , it is also interesting to explore what happens when the dc field is aligned normal to the si(111 ) surface because this orientation has been reported experimentally [ 10 ] and studied theoretically using sbhm [ 13 , 14 ] . to achieve this",
    ", one needs to transform the general tensor to another reference frame before doing the contraction .",
    "this additional step is necessary because the system of reference shown in fig .",
    "1 is not the same as that used in standard group theory textbooks [ 18 , 19 ] , where the @xmath21 axis corresponds to the higher order of rotation of the point group under analysis .",
    "to go from the original system of reference , namely in the direction si(001 ) to the direction of si(111 ) , two independent rotations are required .",
    "the first is a rotation of @xmath81 around the @xmath21 axis and after that a second rotation of @xmath82 about the @xmath83 axis is performed .",
    "one then finally arrives to the si(111 ) orientation .",
    "the transformation is shown in fig . 2 but for simplicity it is shown only acting on a tetrahedral element ; this tetrahedral element can be seen with the bonds located at the left corner of fig . 1 .    [ htbp ]   rotation around @xmath21 axis and c ) a second rotation of @xmath82 around @xmath83 axis , title=\"fig : \" ]    .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ]    matematically , these transformations can be applied to the tensor in eq .",
    "( 17 ) using relation from eq .",
    "first , a rotation is applied about the @xmath21 axis and evaluated at @xmath84 which we label @xmath85 and after that a second transformation about the @xmath83 axis for an angle of @xmath82 as mentioned before labeled @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , after applying these transformations and contracted with a unitary vector in the direction @xmath21 ( in this case the @xmath21 axis is parallel to the direction of si(111 ) as in fig .",
    "2 c ) , the resulting effective third rank tensor for the si(111 ) orientation is @xmath87 which again shows that in sbhm the third rank tensor describing efish requires only one independent parameter which is the second order hyperpolarizability .",
    "thus in the same way , when the tensor is transformed from the ( 001 ) to ( 111 ) direction , the symmetry elements in @xmath5 are reduced only to the @xmath88 axis parallel with @xmath21 .",
    "interestingly from the sbhm viewpoint , the symmetry of a si(111 ) orientation is such that even when two tetrahedral elements are used to represent the bulk response , the symmetry remains the same as that of a si(111 ) surface ( represented by only one tetrahedral element ) in a similar manner when we describe the effective suseptibility in gaas(111 ) in our previous work [ 16 ] but this time due to efish .",
    "therefore , the sbhm model only establishes one additional relation between the independent elements in the tensor because the other ones can be derived from the symmetry in the crystal .",
    "in addition , modeling efish only using one independent element in the tensor is not uncommon at all , kikuchi and tada using quantum mechanical perturbative calculations [ 8 ] showed that under certain conditions it is possible to use only one independent element in the fourth rank tensor to describe efish . in section v we show that using both the fourth and third rank tensor we can model efish perfectly .",
    "we now show that sbhm predicts the experimental efish result for a @xmath89 ( first letter polarization of the @xmath90- field , second letter for -@xmath91 ) of si(111 ) as published by aktsipetrov and coworkers [ 10 ] by using only one hyperpolarizability parameter for the fit .",
    "this assumption is valid if we consider that the shg is generated mainly by charge separation in the si - sio@xmath92 interface . indeed in their transmission experiment ,",
    "the coherence length between fundamental and sh is long or larger than the size of the depletion region , therefore in the measured signal phase matching as well as the surface effect can be neglected which is in agreement with the arguments of refs .",
    "[ 18,19 ] .",
    "in addition , internal photoemission between such interface has been studied using time dependent ( td ) shg as an interface dopant probe [ 27 - 30 ] .",
    "we apply the following bond orientation for the si(111 ) bulk [ 31 ] which is the same if one starts with the diamond unit cell bond orientation in eq .",
    "( 12 ) and perform the necessary transformation into a si(111 ) orientation : @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath55 is the angle between each bond and is equal to @xmath95\\approx109.47^{0}$ ] for silicon .",
    "the far field is obtained by [ 13 , 31 , 32 ] @xmath96\\cdot \\sum \\limits_{n=1}^{n}\\sum \\limits_{j=1}\\mathbf{p}_{j}^{(2),n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a @xmath17 unit tensor , @xmath98 is the considered shg polarization source and @xmath99 is the unit vector of the electric field in the direction of the laboratory observer and has the form @xmath100    following the setup in [ 10 ] , we set @xmath101 so the electric field is polarized along the @xmath83 axis only .",
    "because the intensity is in arbitrary unit we can assign arbitrary constant for the third order hyperpolarizability .",
    "the dc bias is varied for every @xmath102v interval around two reference valleys .",
    "we first simulate the shg azimuthal feature for a zero external dc using eq .",
    "for a zero bias , only the internal field due to the formation of a depletion field contributes to shg . without this internal field",
    "bulk dipole is automatically zero by sbhm simulation because @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 and the radiated fields produced by the bond charges are cancelling out .",
    "the simulation result for the @xmath89 polarization is given in fig .",
    "3 and shows the expected 6 fold pattern at an arbitrary unit shg intensity of @xmath107 ( fig .",
    "3a ) where we assume arbitrary constant internal dc bias ( depletion voltage ) .",
    "the physical explanation according to sbhm is that for a normal incidence field the electric field @xmath108-polarization is parallel to the @xmath83 axis thus affecting each rotated down - bond @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 equally producing a maximal bond radiation when each down bond aligns parallel to the @xmath83 axis ( twice when rotated @xmath112 ) therefore a sixfold shg pattern occurs .",
    "all this occurs naturally using sbhm and one can even look at each single bond contribution before summing them up to get a better physical understanding and found that the up bonds @xmath113 and @xmath114 do not contribute to any shg intensity for a normal incidence @xmath89 field because the bond direction is perpendicular to the direction of the electric field .",
    "this is in our opinion one of the advantages of sbhm because even though limited to the classical view it gives a strong physical picture of how shg is generated by various sources",
    ". the result agrees nicely with the experimental data reported in fig . 1 of the ref . [",
    "our simulation further shows that applying an external dc bias does not change the sixfold pattern but increase or decrease the shg intensity .",
    "[ htbp ] v and the second one is at @xmath115v and is used as the zero volt reference before a forward and backward voltage is applied producing a parabolic curve around the two reference voltages .",
    "the simulation agrees very well with the experimental results in ref .",
    "[ 10],title=\"fig:\",width=604 ]    we next vary the dc bias for a given reference voltage . according to ref .",
    "[ 10 ] there are two shg intensity valleys , namely at @xmath116v with a shg arbitrary unit intensity of around @xmath117 and @xmath118v with a shg intensity of @xmath119 .",
    "aktsipetrov and coworkers argue that the absence of a single valley is either due to electric charge redistribution inside the sio@xmath92 or due to surface states recharging .",
    "whatever is the cause , it somehow shifts the zero bias reference at @xmath116v to @xmath115v and we adopt this shift in the simulation to produce two symmetric parabolic fits ( fig 3b ) . because the shg intensity is obtained by the square of the field two symmetric parabolic curve around the two valleys are expected and is also produced by the simulation .",
    "the simulation result compares well with experiment result in fig . 2 of ref .",
    ". we will show in section vi , how this experiment can be fully reproduced using a third rank tensor approach .",
    "in this section a brief description about a classical process model of efish is provided .",
    "it is well known that the shg dipole response in bulk si(111 ) without a static electric field is zero if we neglect the biatomic structure of si and absorption .",
    "such a system can be modeled as having an atomic potential consisting of only even terms [ 17 ] . when a static field is directed towards the @xmath21 axis it will break the symmetry of the atomic potential .",
    "* from the view of the bond model this static field produces a projection on the three down bonds so that it slightly shifts the equilibrium position of the electron away from the former equilibrium position before the dc field was applied*. because the lattice position can be assumed to be static in the process this change in equilibrium can be seen as breaking the initial symmetry .",
    "[ htbp ]        to the best of our knowledge this picture of the shifting of the potential has never been discussed before .",
    "the potential of a centrosymmetric material can be expressed as : @xmath120 where here we use @xmath121 as the radial coordinate in sbhm , which is related to @xmath21 as @xmath122 , with @xmath123 as angle between the upward bond directions onto the @xmath21 axis .",
    "now a static field along the @xmath21 axis will alter the potential in the form , abbrevating @xmath124 @xmath125 here @xmath126 is the oscillator resonance frequency , @xmath127 is the electron charge , and @xmath128 is the parameter that characterizes the third harmonic generation ( thg ) strength .    this field will produce a shift in the electron potential relative to its initial position , for the bond in [ 111 ] direction the shift will be larger than for the three backbonds . the force equation is then obtained by differentiating the above equation . the new electron equilibrium positions can be obtained by assuming @xmath129 .",
    "the solution is    @xmath130    with @xmath131 as initial , symmetric position .",
    "we now apply a series expansion for the potential @xmath132 around the new electron equilibrium position , @xmath121 and obtain @xmath133^{4}\\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term in the potential containing @xmath0 @xmath134    when viewed in the force equation is proportional to @xmath135 , thus :    @xmath136    it is interesting that based on eq .",
    "( 29 ) the shg efish susceptibility strength depends on the characterizing parameter @xmath128 of thg and yields immediately zero if @xmath137 as expected .",
    "increasing the dc efish voltage will increase the shg contribution .",
    "the linear dependence of @xmath80 on the dc field is important because it will result in a parabolic feature in the intensity when the efish field is altered .",
    "furthermore sbhm immediately predicts that under normal incidence only the three backbonds contribute to the efish signal , despite they experience a rather small shift proportional to @xmath138 , whereas the top bond along the 111 direction does not contribute , because it is perpendicular to the polarization of the wave .",
    "this argument derived from sbhm predicts that for normal incidence on si(001 ) efish should not occur , because the in - plane symmetry @xmath139 is not broken , despite the electrons move out along the @xmath21 direction by the static field .",
    "it is thus clear that the expression for the shg intensity which were applied to plot the experiment using the polarization formula in section v can also be obtained via the third rank tensor in eq .",
    "( 20 ) with an additional rotation freedom about the @xmath21 axis .",
    "indeed both cases will result in a similar intensity formula yielding a 6 fold dependence for the @xmath89 polarization when the applied field is nomal to the surface : @xmath140 where @xmath141 can either be represented by the effective first or second order hyperpolarizability .",
    "therefore the experiment in ref .",
    "[ 10 ] can be fully refitted to the same accuracy using a third rank tensor .",
    "we show that the fourth rank tensor related to thg and dc efish nonlinear polarization obtained from group theory belongs to the @xmath5 point group and in its most general form consists of 4 independent parameters which by symmetry arguments can be reduced further to 2 whereas sbhm agrees with all the tensor elements different from zero but only requires one independent element in the fourth rank tensor which is the third order hyperpolarizability . the fourth rank tensor describing dc efish in the @xmath21 axis can be further reduced to a third rank tensor , where gt shows 2 independent parameters and sbhm requires one .",
    "we then demonstrate that the dc mos efish experiment in ref .",
    "[ 10 ] can indeed be fitted using only one hyperpolarizability value as the fitting parameter . at the end",
