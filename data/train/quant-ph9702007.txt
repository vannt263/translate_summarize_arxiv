    "quantum mechanics is usually introduced as a theory for ensembles , but the invention of ion traps , for example , offers the possibility to observe and manipulate single particles , where observability of quantum jumps , which are not be seen directly in the ensemble , lead to conceptual problems of how to describe single realizations of these systems .",
    "usually bloch equations or einstein rate equations are used to describe the time evolution of ensembles of atoms or ions driven by light .",
    "new approaches via conditional time evolution , given say when no photon has been emitted , have been developed to describe single experimental realizations of quantum systems .",
    "this leads to a description of the system via wave functions instead of density matrices .",
    "this conditional `` quantum trajectory '' approach is still an ensemble description , but for a sub ensemble where we know when photons have been emitted .",
    "the jumps that occur in this description can be considered as due to the increase of our knowledge about the system which is represented by the wave - function ( or the density operator ) describing the system . in the formalism to be presented one usually imagines that gedanken measurements are performed in a rapid succession , for example , on the emitted radiation field .",
    "these will either have the result that a photon has been found in the environment or that no photon has been found .",
    "a sudden change in our information about the radiation field ( for example through the detection of a photon emitted by the system into the environment ) leads to a sudden change of the wave - function of the system .",
    "however , not only the detection of a photon leads to an increase of information but also the failure to detect a photon ( i.e. a null result ) .",
    "new insights have been obtained into atomic dynamics and into dissipative processes , and new powerful theoretical approaches developed .",
    "apart from the new insights into physics these methods also allow the simulation of complicated problems , e.g. , in laser cooling that were completely intractable using the master equation approach . in general it",
    "can be applied to all master equations that are of lindblad form , which is in fact the most general form of a master equation .",
    "this article reviews the various quantum jump approaches developed over the past few years .",
    "we focus on the theoretical description of basic dynamics and on simple instructive examples rather than the application to various numerical simulation methods .",
    "some of the topics covered here can also be found in earlier summaries @xcite and more recent summer school lectures @xcite .",
    "quantum mechanics is a statistical theory which makes probabilistic predictions of the behaviour of ensembles ( an ideally infinite number of identically prepared quantum systems ) using density operators .",
    "this description was completely sufficient for the first 60 years of the existence of quantum mechanics because it was generally regarded as completely impossible to observe and manipulate single quantum systems .",
    "for example , schrdinger , in 1952 wrote @xcite .",
    "+ _ ... we never experiment with just one electron or atom or ( small ) molecule . in thought - experiments",
    "we sometimes assume that we do ; this invariably entails ridiculous consequences . \\ { ... } in the first place it is fair to state that we are not experimenting with single particles , any more than we can raise ichthyosauria in the zoo . _ + this ( rather extreme ) opinion was challenged by a remarkable idea of dehmelt which he first made public in 1975 @xcite .",
    "he considered the problem of high precision spectroscopy , where one wants to measure the transition frequency of an optical transition as accurately as possible , e.g. , by observing the resonance fluorescence from that transition as part ( say ) of an optical frequency standard .",
    "however , the accuracy of such a measurement is fundamentally limited by the spectral width of the observed transition .",
    "the spectral width is due to spontaneous emission from the upper level of the transition which leads to a finite lifetime @xmath0 of the upper level .",
    "basic fourier considerations then imply a spectral width of the scattered photons of the order of @xmath1 . to obtain a precise value of the transition frequency",
    ", it would therefore be advantageous to excite a metastable transition which scatters only a few photons within the measurement time .",
    "on the other hand one then has the problem of detecting these few photons and this turns out to be practically impossible by direct observation .",
    "so obviously one has arrived at a major dilemma here .",
    "dehmelt s proposal however suggests a solution to these problems , provided one would be able to observe and manipulate single ions or atoms which became possible with the invention of single ion traps @xcite ( for a review see @xcite .",
    "we illustrate dehmelts idea in its original simplified rate equation picture .",
    "it runs as follows .    instead of observing the photons emitted on the metastable two - level system",
    "directly , he proposed to use an optical double resonance scheme as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2.1 ] .",
    "one laser drives the metastable @xmath2 transition while a second strong laser saturates the strong @xmath3 ; the lifetime of the upper level @xmath4 is for example @xmath5 while that of level @xmath6 is of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "if the initial state of the system is the lower state @xmath8 then the strong laser will start to excite the system to the rapidly decaying level @xmath4 , which will then lead to the emission of a photon after a time which is usually very short ( of the order of the lifetime of level @xmath4 ) .",
    "this emission restores the system back to the lower level @xmath8 ; the strong laser can start to excite the system again to level @xmath4 which will emit a photon on the strong transition again .",
    "this procedure repeats until at some random time the laser on the weak transition manages to excite the system into its metastable state @xmath6 where it remains shelved for a long time , until it jumps back to the ground state either by spontaneous emission or by stimulated emission due to the laser on the @xmath2-transition . during the time the electron rests in the metastable state @xmath6 , no photons will be scattered on the strong transition and only when the electron jumps back to state 0 can the fluorescence on the strong transition start again .",
    "therefore from the switching on and off of the resonance fluorescence on the strong transition ( which is easily observable ) we can infer the extremely rare transitions on the @xmath2 transition .",
    "therefore we have a method to monitor rare quantum jumps ( transitions ) on the metastable @xmath2 transition by observation of the fluorescence from the strong @xmath3 transition .",
    "a typical experimental fluorescence signal is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2.2 ] @xcite where the fluorescence intensity @xmath9 is plotted . however , this scheme only works if we observe a single quantum system , because if we observe a large number of systems simultaneously the random nature of the transitions between levels @xmath8 and @xmath6 implies that some systems will be able to scatter photons on the strong transition while others are not because they are in their metastable state at that moment . from a large collection of ions observed simultaneously one would then obtain a more or less constant intensity of photons emitted on the strong transition .",
    "the calculation of this mean intensity is a straightforward task using standard bloch equations .",
    "the calculation of single system properties such as the distribution of the lengths of the periods of strong fluorescence , required some effort which eventually led to the development of the quantum jump approach .",
    "apart from the interesting theoretical implications for the study of individual quantum systems , dehmelt s proposal obviously has important practical applications .",
    "an often cited example is the realization of a new time standard using a single atom in a trap .",
    "the key idea here is to use either the instantaneous intensity or the photon statistics of the emitted radiation on the strong transition ( the statistics of the bright- and dark periods ) to stabilise the frequency of the laser on the weak transition .",
    "this is possible because the photon statistics of the strong radiation depends on the detuning of the laser on the weak transition @xcite .",
    "therefore a change in the statistics of bright and dark periods indicates that the frequency of the weak laser has shifted and has to be adjusted .",
    "however , for continuously radiating lasers this frequency shift will also depend on the intensity of the laser on the strong transition . therefore in practise",
    "pulsed schemes are preferable for frequency standards @xcite + due to the inability of experimentalists to store , manipulate and observe single quantum systems ( ions ) at the time of dehmelt s proposal , both the practical as well as the theoretical implications of his proposal were not immediately investigated .",
    "it was about ten years later that this situation changed . at that time cook and kimble published a paper @xcite in which they made the first attempt to analyse the situation described above theoretically .",
    "their advance was stimulated by the fact that by that time it had become possible to actually store _ single _ ions in an ion trap ( paul trap ) @xcite .    in their simplified rate equation approach cook and",
    "kimble started with the rate equations for an incoherently driven three level system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2.1 ] and assumed that the strong @xmath3 transition is driven to saturation .",
    "they consequently simplify their rate equations introducing the probabilities @xmath10 of being in the metastable state and @xmath11 of being in the strongly fluorescing @xmath3 transition .",
    "this simplification now allows the description of the resonance fluorescence to be reduced to that of a two state random telegraph process .",
    "either the atomic population is in the levels @xmath8 and @xmath4 and therefore the ion is strongly radiating ( on ) , or the population rests in the metastable level @xmath6 and no fluorescence is observed ( off ) .",
    "they then proceed to calculate the distributions for the lengths of bright and dark periods and find that their distribution is poissonian .",
    "their analysis that we have outlined very briefly here is of course very much simplified in many respects .",
    "the most important point is certainly the fact that cook and kimble assume incoherent driving and therefore adopt a rate equation model . in a real experiment coherent radiation from lasers",
    "the complications arising in coherent excitation finally led to the development of the quantum jump approach . despite of these problems",
    "the analysis of cook and kimble showed the possibility of direct observation of quantum jumps in the fluorescence of single ions , a prediction that was confirmed shortly afterwards in a number of experiments @xcite and triggered off a large number of more detailed investigations starting with early works by javanainen in @xcite .",
    "the following effort of a great number of physicists eventually culminated in the development of the quantum jump approach .",
    "before we present this subsequent development in greater detail we would like to study in slightly more detail how the dynamics of the system determines the statistics of bright and dark periods . again",
    "assume a three - level system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2.1 ] . provided the @xmath12 and @xmath13 rabi frequencies are small compared with the decay rates , one finds for the population in the strongly - fluorescing level 1 as a function of time something like the behaviour shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2.3 ] ( we derive this in detail in a later section . ) .",
    "we choose for this figure the values @xmath14 for the einstein - coefficients of levels @xmath4 and @xmath6 reflecting the metastability of level 2 . for times short",
    "compared with the metastable lifetime @xmath15 then of course the atomic dynamics can hardly be aware of level 2 and evolves as a 0  1 _ two - level _ system with the  steady state ",
    "population @xmath16 of the upper level . after a time @xmath15 the metastable state has an effect and the ( ensemble - averaged ) population in level 1 reduces to the appropriate _ three - level _ equilibrium values .",
    "the `` hump '' @xmath17 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2.3 ] is actually a signature of the telegraphic fluorescence discussed above . to show this ,",
    "consider a few sequences of bright and dark periods in the telegraph signal as shown in fig .",
    ". the total rate of emission @xmath18 is proportional to the rate in a bright period times the fraction of the evolution made up of bright periods .",
    "this gives @xmath19 but this has to be equal to the true average , @xmath20 so that @xmath21 and the ratio of the period of bright to dark intervals is governed , as we claimed , by the `` hump '' @xmath22    so far , we have concentrated on situations where the rabi frequencies are small ( or for incoherent excitation ) .",
    "what happens for _ coherent _ resonant excitation with larger rabi frequencies ?",
    "the answer to this question is _ nothing _",
    "@xcite : there are essentially _ no _ quantum jumps , at least at any significant level for coherently - driven resonantly excited three - level systems ! but this is because of the idea of resonance is tricky : the strong rabi frequency on the @xmath3 transition dresses the atom and the ac - stark effect splits @xcite the transition , forcing the system substantially out of resonance . if this is recognised and the probe laser driving the @xmath2 transition is detuned from the bare resonance until it matches the dressed atom resonance , then the jumps and telegraphic fluorescence return .",
    "we investigate this phenomenon more closely in section v. as far as we know , the dependence of the telegraph fluorescence on detuning for coherently excited transitions has yet to be confirmed experimentally .",
    "let us return to the idea of a null measurement .",
    "we imagine that we observe the fluorescence from a driven three - level ion over a time scale which is long compared with the strongly fluorescing state lifetime @xmath23 but very short compared with the shelf state lifetime @xmath15 so that @xmath24 pegg and knight @xcite have shown that the average period of brightness and darkness in the telegraphic fluorescence can be obtained very straightforwardly from considerations of null detection . during such an interval",
    "@xmath25 the population in the shelf state , @xmath26 hardly has time to evolve , but population can be rapidly cycled from the ground state @xmath27 to the strongly - fluorescing state @xmath28 and back .",
    "detection of a photon at the beginning of a @xmath29 interval implies a survival in the 0  1 sector for the whole interval and a bright period , whereas a _",
    "null _ detection is sufficient for us to be confident that the atom is shelved for the whole @xmath29 interval and a dark period ensues .",
    "if we take our origin of time to be after an interval @xmath29 in which we see a photon , then @xmath30 we can introduce the `` life expectancy '' @xmath31 as the time the atom spends in the 0  1 sector _",
    "continuously_. if the atom is still in this sector at a time @xmath32 ( known from an observation of another fluorescence photon just prior to @xmath32 ) , then the life expectancy will be also be @xmath33 so we can partition the outcomes into the case where at @xmath32 it has survived in the 0  1 sector with probability @xmath34 and the case where the ion did not survive the whole interval @xmath32 continuously in the 0  1 sector @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a fraction @xmath37 then for small @xmath32 @xmath38 and if @xmath32 is small so we may neglect the possibility of a _ return _ from state @xmath39 back in to the 0  1 sector , @xmath40 so that @xmath41 this is finite , so we know that the fluorescence _ will _ terminate . to obtain a value for @xmath42 we merely need to know the evolution equation ( not its solution ) for the population in state @xmath43",
    "this would be the bloch equation for coherent excitation , or the einstein rate equation for incoherent excitation .",
    "the calculation of the mean period of darkness proceeds along similar lines : if _ no _ photons are detected in an interval @xmath29 just before @xmath44 we find @xmath45 the analysis presented here obviously also applies for the density operator equations in exactly the same form and we obtain @xmath46 here the dot means the _ average _ gradient of the @xmath47 versus @xmath48 curve over a range of order @xmath29 . because @xmath29 is much smaller than the characteristic change of @xmath47 it is very close to the normal derivative at all points .",
    "it is straightforward to use this idea of `` collapse by non - detection '' to estimate the characteristic time needed to be sure that a quantum jump has occurred @xcite .",
    "there are @xmath49 times as many short dark periods between photon emissions as there are prolonged dark periods of average length @xmath50 , where @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for strong transition saturation ) is the average length of the short period .",
    "thus the probability that an emission will be followed by a long dark period is approximately @xmath53 for @xmath54 , and the probability that it will be followed by a short dark period is close to unity .    immediately following a photon emission , a dark period of length at least @xmath0 ( with @xmath55 )",
    "can exist for two complementary reasons : ( a ) the atom goes to state @xmath56 and therefore does not decay for a time of the order of @xmath50 , or ( b ) the atom is still in the @xmath57 plane but has not yet emitted a photon .",
    "the probability of ( a ) occurring is @xmath53 and the probability of ( b ) is approximately @xmath58 .",
    "clearly for @xmath59 it is much more likely that any observed dark period of length @xmath0 is due to ( b ) , but this becomes rapidly less likely as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the point where the observation of the dark period is just as likely to involve ( a ) as ( b ) is found by equating the two expressions to give @xmath60 it follows that the sampling period @xmath29 must be greater than @xmath0 given by eq .",
    "( [ 991 ] ) this value in order for the observation of darkness during @xmath29 to imply ( a ) with reasonable certainty .",
    "further , because we know that immediately following the emission the atom is in @xmath61 , so the probability of being in @xmath56 is zero , and because eq . ( [ 991 ] ) gives the order of the time of darkness required for the probability of being in @xmath56 to grow to about @xmath62 , eq.([991 ] ) gives the characteristic time for the wave - function collapse by non - detection .",
    "this characteristic time can be associated with the time necessary for us to be certain that a quantum jump from @xmath61 to @xmath56 has occurred . for completely coherent excitation eq .",
    "( [ 991 ] ) reduces to an expression similar to that for the `` shelving time '' found in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "note that while the collapse by non - detection of the system into the metastable state requires a finite time the collapse of the wave function due to the detection of a photon has to be viewed as practically instantaneous .",
    "when we detect a photon our knowledge of the system changes suddenly and this sudden change of knowledge is reflected by the sudden change of the system state which , after all , represents our knowledge of the system .",
    "before we develop detailed theoretical models to describe individual quantum trajectories ( i.e. state evolution conditioned on a particular sequence of observed events ) , it is useful to examine how the entire ensemble evolves .",
    "this is in line with the historical development as initially it was tried to find quantum jump characteristics in the ensemble behaviour of the system.we do this in detail for the particular three ",

    "the einstein rate equations for the v  system are @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the einstein a- and b - coefficients for the relevant spontaneous and induced transitions , @xmath65 the applied radiation field energy density at the relevant transition frequency , and @xmath66 is the relative population in state @xmath67 ( @xmath68 for this * closed * system ) . in shelving , we assume that both @xmath69 and @xmath70 are much larger than @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and furthermore that @xmath73 . the steady  state solutions of these rate equations are straightforward to obtain , and we find @xmath74      \\rho_{22}(t\\rightarrow \\infty ) = \\frac{b_2w_2(a_1+b_1w_1 ) }      { a_1(a_2 + 2b_2w_2 ) + b_1w_1(2a_2 + 3b_2w_2 ) } \\;\\ ; .",

    "however , the dynamics reveals a different story to that suggested by the steady state populations . again ,",
    "if the allowed transition is saturated , then the time  dependent solutions of the excited state rate equations tell us that for @xmath78 we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 note that the these expressions are good only for strong driving of the @xmath3 transition .",
    "this especially means that for short times @xmath81 is of the order of @xmath82 which results in eq .",
    "( [ 3.9 ] ) .",
    "then for a very long  lived shelf state @xmath6 , we see that for saturated transitions ( @xmath83 ) @xmath84 and @xmath85 these innocuous  looking expressions contain a lot of physics .",
    "we remember that state @xmath4 is the strongly fluorescing state . on a time ",
    "scale which is short compared with @xmath86 , we see that the populations attain a * quasi*steady state appropriate to the * two - level * ( @xmath3 ) dynamics @xmath87 this can of course be confirmed in an experiment @xcite . for truly long times the third , shelving , state makes its effect and @xmath88 as we saw qualitatively in fig .",

    "level dynamics already gives us a signature of quantum jumps and telegraphic fluorescence provided we are wise enough to recognise the signs .",
    "figure [ fig2.3 ] illustrates the change from two to three  level dynamics .",
    "the steady  state populations are sufficient to describe the average level of the fluorescent intensity .",
    "but how do quantum jumps and shelving show up in the intensity correlations ?",
    "for example , let us examine the second order correlation function @xmath89 where the colons describe normal ordering @xcite .",
    "this correlation function is straightforward to compute from the einstein rate equations using the quantum regression theorem @xcite which relates one - time to two  time correlations given the dynamics is markovian .",
    "here of course there are * two * intensities , that of the @xmath90 and of the @xmath91 fluorescence , so we can correlate the two light fields : `` 1 '' with `` 1 '' , or `` 1 '' with `` 2 '' and so on , where `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' represent the fluorescence on the @xmath90 and the @xmath91 transitions respectively .",
    "so let us concentrate on evaluating @xmath92 , which represents the joint probability of detecting a fluorescent photon @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) on the transition @xmath93 at time @xmath48 and * some * other photon ( not necessarily the * next * photon ) from transition @xmath67 at time @xmath95 .",

    "it is worth noting that for short times @xmath0 we expect to see anti - bunching @xcite from this * three  level * fluorescence , and this has been observed experimentally from trapped ions @xcite .    in the mid 1980 s when studies of quantum jump dynamics of laser  driven three ",

    "we have to choose either the quantum jump approach or the quantum state diffusion model to obtain the correct description of the experimental situation .",
    "quantum state diffusion was , as mentioned before , not originally introduced to describe a specific experimental situation .",
    "it was rather seen as an attempt to formulate alternative versions of quantum mechanics and there are attempts to derive diffusion equations from fundamental ideas such as , for example , decoherence induced by gravitational fluctuations @xcite . although the quantum state diffusion model can not be regarded as the proper description of quantum jumps in single photon counting experiments but rather as the description of heterodyne detection it is nevertheless useful in the investigation of single system behaviour .",
    "interesting phenomena such as localisation in phase and position space @xcite are found .",
    "these can be used to improve the performance of simulation procedures using a  moving basis ",

    "so far , we have discussed the evolution of _ open _ systems , that is of microsystems in contact with markovian reservoirs such as the bath of vacuum field modes responsible for spontaneous emission . the quantum jump concept within an open system context has to do with the gain in information about the microsystem which is accessible from the record available in the dissipative environment .",
    "such jump processes do _ not _ require an extension or modification of conventional quantum mechanics , and we refer to these as `` extrinsic '' jumps .",
    "a very different jump mechanism has been studied by a number of authors @xcite . in these approaches",
    "the schrdinger equation is modified in such a way that quantum coherences are automatically destroyed in a _ closed _",
    "system by an _",
    "intrinsic _ stochastic jump mechanism .",
    "this should be distinguished from the extrinsic mechanisms we are concerned with in the bulk of this review .    to see how an intrinsic jump mechanism works , we need a concrete realisation which we can apply to a specific time evolution .",
    "milburn has proposed just such a realisation @xcite , in which standard quantum mechanics is modified in a simple way to generate intrinsic decoherence .",
    "he assumes that on sufficiently short time steps , the system does not evolve continuously under normal unitary evolution , but rather in a _",
    "stochastic _ sequence of identical unitary transformations .",
    "this assumption leads to a modification of the schrdinger equation which contains a term responsible for the decay of quantum coherence in the energy eigenstate basis , without the intervention of a reservoir and therefore without the usual energy dissipation associated with normal decay @xcite .",
    "the decay is entirely of phase - dependence only , akin to the dephasing decay of coherences produced by impact - theory collisions or by fluctuations in the phase of a laser in laser spectroscopy , but here of intrinsic origin .",
    "it is interesting to apply milburn s model of intrinsic decoherence to a problem of dynamical evolution : that is , the interaction of two subsystems and the coherences which establish themselves as a consequence of their interaction . in @xcite",
    "the interaction between a single two - level atom and a quantized cavity mode was considered and shown how the intrinsic decoherence affects the long  time coherence characteristics of the entangled atom  field system .",
    "in particular it could be shown how the revivals ( a signature of long  time coherence ) are removed by this intrinsic decoherence .",
    "the quantum jump approach as we have discussed it so far only treats systems ( atoms ) interacting with a markovian bath ( the quantized multimode radiation field ) .",
    "however , one might be interested to apply the quantum jump approach to non markovian interactions .",
    "examples are electrons interacting with phonons or , in quantum optics , an atom in a cavity interacting with a mode which loses photons to the outside world @xcite .",
    "the second example already suggests a possible way one could model such systems . here",
    "the atom sees a cavity mode with finite width , i.e. , a spectral function which is not flat but a lorentzian ( piraux _ et al _ , 1990 and references therein .",
    "however , one does not need to solve a non markovian master equation , as the width of the mode is produced by its coupling to the outside world . taking this coupling explicitly into account , by describing a coupled atom - cavity field mode with a dissipative field coupling to the environment ,",
    "one again obtains a markovian master equation .",
    "this is also the recipe for the treatment of an interaction with a bath with a general spectral function @xmath304 @xcite .",
    "one has to decompose @xmath304 into a sum ( or integral ) of lorentzians with positive weights .",
    "each lorentzian can then be modelled by a mode interacting with both the system and a markovian reservoir .",
    "this method is practical only if the number of additional modes that one has to take into account is not too large .",
    "one should also note that in this case the meaning of a jump in the simulation can become obscure , as the excitation of the system is transferred to the markovian bath in two steps via the additional mode @xcite .",
    "however , if one is only interested in a simulation method to obtain the master equation for non markovian interactions this is not important .",
    "we have discussed a number of derivations of the quantum jump approach so far .",
    "a different approach towards the description of single system dynamics has been proposed in @xcite . in their method",
    "the dynamics described by the master equation is split into two distinct parts .",
    "one part changes smoothly the instantaneous basis of the density operator ( coherent evolution ) while the other part causes jumps between the basis states according to a rate equation .",
    "the instantaneous basis can be viewed as a generalisation of the dressed state basis . for a stationary state",

    "et al _ ( 1992 ) is possible , although this is not obviously the case for the simulation procedure of mlmer _ et al _ ( 1993 ) .",
    "a problem lies in the fact that four different wave functions have to be propagated in the procedure , each of which might follow different jump sequences . furthermore even if only one jump sequence is followed , it is not clear what the interpretation of the correlation function is",
    ". this may be illustrated by the following example .",
    "we now would like to simulate a trivial correlation function of the form @xmath456 .",
    "we would expect that in each realization the simulation procedure would give the same result as for the single time expectation value @xmath457 .",

    "coherence between component parts of a superposition state changes in amplitude and is eventually destroyed .",
    "however , this is not the only way in which coherence between superposition states is destroyed . in the following example",
    "we show that the decay of coherence of a schrdinger cat of the form @xmath561 is due to a randomisation of the relative phase between the two coherent states while the modulus of the relative phase remains invariant under the no  jump evolution @xcite . in each individual realization",

    "therefore in the ensemble average the cat decoheres before the amplitudes of its constituents are significantly affected @xcite .",
    "another example that shows that the loss of coherence can be due to phase shifts at random times is the phenomenon of revivals in the jaynes - cummings model ( shore and knight ( 1993 ) and references therein ) . in this phenomenon",
    "a two - level atom is initially in its excited state @xmath4 while the cavity field is in a coherent state with amplitude @xmath312 , @xmath566 this initial product state becomes entangled ( ekert and knight ( 1995 ) and references therein ) and the average excitation of the atom rapidly tends towards @xmath82 .",
    "the reason for this is the fact that the frequency of rabi oscillations depends on the number of photons in the field mode @xcite .",

    "the stochastic modulation of the resonance fluorescence due to dark periods leads to a partial broadening of the rayleigh peak .",
    "the small width of the additional peak in the resonance fluorescence spectrum is then understood from the fact that the correlation time @xmath612 of the random telegraph process f(t ) which simulates the light and dark periods is very large .",
    "in fact it is easy to show that @xmath613 this results in an extremely narrow distribution in frequency space with a width @xmath614 .",
    "it is this structure which is observable in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence .",
    "it is interesting to note that the narrow peak is not easily interpreted in a dressed - states picture .",

    "even if we tune the laser on the @xmath2 transition to resonance with one of the dressed states , i.e .. @xmath616 , the weight of the narrow peak comes out much too small .",
    "in fact it would then be predicted to be proportional to @xmath617 .",
    "the narrow peak found here has clearly a different origin than the line narrowing effects found by others @xcite where the systems do not exhibit bright and dark periods in their resonance fluorescence but simply a decrease in intensity .",
    "the existence of bright and dark periods in the resonance fluorescence leads to a narrow peak in the spectrum but it should be noted that the converse is not necessarily true .",
    "there are situations ( eg a laser driven tls in a squeezed vacuum @xcite ) in which the spectrum of resonance fluorescence exhibits narrow peaks but where the photon statistics does not show bright and dark periods .",
    "the reason for that can be found in the fact that the photon statistics is governed by the population decay rates while the spectrum of resonance fluorescence is derived from the @xmath618 correlation function which is strongly influenced by the decay rates of the coherences in the system . in the case of a tls in squeezed light",
    "the coherences have a slowly decaying component while the population decay rate is still large .      as a last application of the quantum jump approach we would like to investigate the influence that spontaneous emission has on the function of a quantum computer .",
    "quantum computing is an idea that has attracted enormous interest in the last two years .",
    "it was elevated from the obscurity of theoretical idealisation to possible practical applications by the discovery of an algorithm by shor ( 1994 ) ( see also ekert and josza ( 1996 ) and references therein ) that allows the factorization of large numbers in polynomial time on a quantum computer as compared to the exponential time required on a classical computer . however , this achievement in computing speed is only possible due to the massive use of the superposition principle in quantum mechanics .",
    "the basic idea is that a qubit ( a two level system ) can exist in a superposition of the two values @xmath8 and @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath324 qubits can then exist in a superposition of @xmath619 values .",
    "these values can then be manipulated by a series of unitary transformations . a final readout",
    "can then provide us with information about global properties of the function implemented by the unitary transformation .",
    "such a global property of the function is , for example , its period which a quantum computer determines by performing a discrete fourier transform , something which can also be implemented on a quantum computer @xcite . in the course of its time evolution ( computation )",
    "the quantum computer evolves into a highly entangled state .",
    "however , it is known that any entangled state is very sensitive to dissipation .",
    "therefore one expects that the quantum computer is highly sensitive to spontaneous emission and other sources of dissipation .",
    "this is in fact the case and currently research in quantum error correction methods has concentrated on attempts to find methods to correct for these errors @xcite .",
    "the quantum jump approach is ideally suited for the investigation of this problem because it is able to describe single runs of a quantum computer rather than an ensemble of quantum computers as in the bloch equation description .",
    "we will illustrate the problems caused by spontaneous emission in quantum computers by examining the example of the discrete fourier transform mentioned above .",
    "there are two effects contributing to the decoherence of the quantum computer .",
    "one is the obvious fact that a spontaneous emission will destroy at least part of the coherence in the quantum computer .",
    "the second decohering effect , however , originates from the conditional time evolution between spontaneous emissions @xcite .",
    "we have learnt above that this time evolution is actually different from the unit operation because even the non - detection of a photon represents a gain in our knowledge about the system .",
    "therefore the wavefunction of the system , which represents our knowledge of the system , has to change .",
    "this leads to a distortion of the time evolution , which will then affect the result of our calculation . in figs .",
    "[ fourier1 ] and [ fourier2 ] we simulate a quantum computer ( we do not go into detail concerning its implementation here ) that calculates the discrete fourier transform of a function that is evaluated at @xmath620 points @xcite .",
    "the resulting square modulus of the wavefunction of the quantum computer is compared to the exact result obtained from a absolutely stable quantum computer .",
    "the function on which we perform the dft is given for definiteness in this example by @xmath621 for @xmath622 .",
    "one can implement the hamilton operators ( in the lamb - dicke limit ) for all the necessary quantum gates in a linear ion trap @xcite to realize this dft .",
    "in addition to the coherent time evolution , possible spontaneous emissions from the upper levels of the ions are taken into account but all other sources of loss are neglected .    in fig .",
    "[ fourier1 ] one emission has taken place during the calculation time of the quantum computer . if we compare the resulting wavefunction with the correct wavefunction , we observe a marked difference between the two . in fig .",
    "[ fourier2 ] we show the wavefunction of an unstable quantum computer which has not suffered a spontaneous emission during the calculation of the dft .",
    "we clearly see that even when no spontaneous emission has taken place , the wavefunction of the quantum computer differs substantially from the correct result .",
    "this difference becomes stronger and stronger the larger the ratio between the computation time @xmath130 and the spontaneous lifetime @xmath623 of the quantum computer becomes .",
    "therefore the wavefunction of the quantum computer will be sufficiently close to the correct result only if the whole computation is finished in a time @xmath130 that is much shorter than the spontaneous lifetime @xmath623 of the quantum computer .",
    "the fact that even one spontaneous emission will usually make the result of the quantum computation completely incorrect can then be used to derive stringent upper limits to the numbers that can be factorized on a quantum computer @xcite .",
    "this again shows that knowledge of the single system behaviour gained from the quantum jump approach gives us useful new insights into important properties of quantum systems .",
    "recent work in quantum optics has forced us to re - examine the dynamics of individual quantum systems in which single realizations ( single atoms or trapped ions , single cavity field modes and so on ) are described in quantum mechanics . in these situations ,",
    "the dynamics is always dissipative , and leaves a record of its history accessible in the wider world of the outside environment .",
    "if this record is read , so that we acquire specific information , then we can associate a specific quantum trajectory to that conditional record . in this way we `` unravel '' the dissipative master equation into a family of records .",
    "we have reviewed the new technique developed to describe this unravelling which go under the name of quantum jumps , monte carlo wavefunction simulations and so on .",
    "we have further demonstrated how they can be used to describe entirely non - classical behaviour in a wide range of situations in quantum optics .",

    "<S> dissipation , the irreversible loss of energy and coherence , from a microsystem , is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem ( or reservoir ) which is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of its degrees of freedom . the microsystem evolution is then described by tracing over the reservoir states , resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir environment . </S>",
    "<S> earlier treatments of this dissipation described an * ensemble * of microsystems using density matrices , either in schrdinger picture with master equations , or in heisenberg picture with langevin equations . </S>",
    "<S> the development of experimental techniques to study single quantum systems ( for example single trapped ions , or cavity radiation field modes ) has stimulated the construction of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a particular observation record of the decay channel , in the environment . </S>",
    "<S> these methods , variously described as quantum jump , monte carlo wavefunction and quantum trajectory methods are the subject of this review article . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss their derivation , apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics and relate them to ensemble descriptions .     </S>"
