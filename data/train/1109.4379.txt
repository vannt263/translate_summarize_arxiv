    "the observed mass - to - flux ratios are typically slightly supercritical with @xmath6 @xcite indicating a significant influence of magnetic fields on the star formation process . in turbulence simulations , however , also higher values of @xmath5 up to 20 , i.e. weaker magnetic fields , have been found  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "despite the intensive research in this field there is still no consensus about what drives the outflows beside the fact that all outflows are magnetically driven .",
    "different results can be found in literature about whether the outflow is driven by centrifugal acceleration  @xcite or by the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "a possible reason for this might be the different methods used to analyse the outflows . in this work we seek to clarify this problem by deriving a fully self - consistent , generalised criterion from magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) wind theory to determine the underlying driving mechanism .",

    "we use the same simulations as in .",
    "we note that the initial conditions are selected in a way to cover a large parameter space in accordance with observations and numerical simulations . with the generalised outflow criterion derived in this work",
    "we will show that magneto - centrifugally driven outflows consist of two different regimes described by the mhd wind theory . in the first regime close to the disc and the rotation axis , acceleration is dominated by the centrifugal force ,",
    "i.e. gas gets flung outwards along the poloidal magnetic field lines , whereas in the second regime further away from the disc @xmath10 starts to dominate the acceleration .",
    "furthermore we will also show that despite large morphological differences all outflows observed in this work are launched by centrifugal acceleration and that the differences in collimation are mainly caused by varying hoop stresses .",

    "we will discuss this behaviour in detail at the end of section  [ sec : launch26 ] .",
    "[ fig:26 - 4 ] also shows that a bow shock at the tip of the outflow develops extending down to the edge of the centrifugally supported disc . as indicated by the velocity vectors ,",
    "most of the gas within the bow shock is directed vertically outwards with velocities up to 15 km s@xmath2 .",

    "we especially note the very turbulent structure seen in the outflow after 5000 yr in both the density field and the outflow velocity .",
    "several internal shock fronts and instabilities have occurred in the outflow although no perturbations are included in the initial conditions .",
    "this turbulent structure is a consequence of instabilities and not of episodic ejection events .",
    "we checked this by visual inspecting the time evolution of the outflow , finding that continuous ejection occurs over the whole time range .",

    "interesting fact is that the gas is continuously ejected from the disc over the whole 5000 yr although the protostellar disc starts to fragment around t @xmath31 2500 yr and has formed 12 further fragments by then  .",
    "hence , fragmentation does not necessarily terminate the driving of outflows , a fact which is also observed in run 26 - 20 .    to study the outflow structure in more detail , we show the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram of the outflow at 5000 yr in fig .  [",

    "firstly , the relative importance of the toroidal ( @xmath33 ) and poloidal magnetic field ( @xmath34 ) for the total magnetic energy content in the outflow is studied .",

    "the @xmath19-axis suitable for centrifugal acceleration.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]    as can be seen , almost the complete outflow region is dominated by @xmath33 .",
    "the toroidal component is created by the rotation of the protostellar disc in which the initially purely poloidal magnetic field is anchored .",
    "@xmath33 reaches values larger than @xmath34 by up to 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , @xmath33 should have a crucial effect on the evolution of the outflow .",
    "depending on the position , the absolute values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 vary between @xmath8 0.01 g and @xmath8 1 g.    outflows driven by the pressure gradient of the toroidal magnetic field are described by @xcite and are often termed as magnetic tower flows . the fact that the outflow region is mainly dominated by @xmath33 suggest that the outflow is such a magnetic tower flow .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that the region close to the symmetry axis , where the highest velocities occur ( see bottom panel of fig .  [ fig:26 - 4 ] ) , is either only weakly dominated by the toroidal magnetic field or even dominated by @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "we emphasise that even a field configuration which is dominated by @xmath33 does not contradict the centrifugal acceleration mechanism .",
    "find values of @xmath35 up to @xmath8 10 ( see their fig .",
    "4 ) in the acceleration region in agreement with our findings .",
    "therefore , we assume that the outflow is driven by centrifugal acceleration although there is certainly a contribution to the acceleration by @xmath33 as well . of course , this assumption has to be confirmed quantitatively in the following .",
    "to do so , in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mag26 - 4 ] we analyse the magnetic field structure in detail concentrating on the inner region where the jet is launched .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field lines are overplotted on the density field .",
    "in addition , we show the poloidal velocity field and the contours where @xmath35 = 1 , 10 respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the field lines just above / below the disc are strongly inclined against the @xmath19-axis . except for the innermost part",
    "the inclination angle is everywhere above 30@xmath38 which is required to launch cold gas from the disc by centrifugal acceleration  .",
    "here we emphasise that an inclination angle smaller than 30@xmath38 does not necessarily mean that centrifugal launching is impossible .",
    "the 30@xmath38 condition is valid only for a cold gas , i.e. if thermal pressure can be neglected .",
    "as soon as a thermal pressure gradient is present aiding to accelerate the gas upwards , even inclination angles below 30@xmath38 are sufficient for jet launching . as there is clearly a pressure increase towards the centre in the simulation ,",
    "the innermost region is suitable for centrifugal acceleration as well even though the inclination is below 30@xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned before in the inner region where the actual acceleration takes place , the magnetic field is not or only weakly dominated by @xmath33 in agreement with the findings of  .",
    "in contrast , for a magnetic tower flow  @xcite one would expect a much more wound up structure with a clearly dominating toroidal magnetic field component .",
    "however , we note that the toroidal magnetic pressure also contributes to the acceleration of the gas as implied in the mhd wind theory ( see equation  ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) ) .",
    "as argued before , the launching from the disc itself , however , is most likely due to centrifugal acceleration .    to further support the conclusion of a centrifugally driven wind",
    ", we apply the two criteria derived in section  [ sec : crit ] ( see equations  [ eq : crit2 ] and [ eq : crit ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the @xcite criterion , we can in general determine the driving mechanism of the outflow away from the disc surface .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] , where the regions where the criteria are fulfilled are shaded grey .      +      as can be seen , within about 800 au above / below the disc there is a continuous region close to the @xmath19-axis where centrifugally dominated acceleration is possible ( left panel ) . also at larger heights centrifugal acceleration",
    "partly works , in particular close to the symmetry axis of the jet .",
    "the grey shaded region around the @xmath19-axis in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] agrees very well with the region where the highest outflow velocities are detected . hence , despite the strong assumptions like stationarity , axis - symmetry and corotation used to derive the criterion given in equation  ( [ eq : crit ] ) , it works reasonably well .",
    "in particular , it is applicable to regions far from the disc surface in contrast to the 30@xmath38 - criterion of .",
    "we therefore draw the following conclusions : the assumption of corotation is reasonably well fulfilled in the inner part of the outflow ( @xmath39 au ) despite the partly significant toroidal magnetic field ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mag26 - 4 ] ) .",
    "hence , the central jet can be considered as centrifugally driven , i.e. gas gets flung out- and upwards along the poloidal magnetic field lines .",
    "the result also demonstrates that the 30@xmath38 condition ",
    "apart from the disc surface  and the ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath34 are not sufficient to determine the driving mechanism above / below the disc .",
    "taking into account the effect of @xmath33 in the most general expression of magneto - centrifugal driving ( equation  ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) ) gives a markedly different result ( see right panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : bp82_26 ] ) .",
    "the grey shaded areas are now much more volume filling , in particular in the outer parts of the outflow with radii @xmath40 au where outflowing gas is present as well .",
    "as purely centrifugal dominated acceleration does not work in this region , we expect @xmath33 to be mainly responsible for the outflow driving .",
    "the results in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] nicely demonstrate the capability of our criterion to distinguish between the different driving mechanisms which was the reason for its derivation .",
    "an increasing importance of @xmath33 for the driving can also be seen in the upper parts of the outflow ( @xmath41 au ) .",
    "here the situation is less suitable for pure centrifugal acceleration ( bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] ) but in general magneto - centrifugal acceleration is still possible in great parts ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "this is why we argue that @xmath33 must contribute significantly to the outflow dynamics at great heights .",
    "we note that even the general criterion given in equation  ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) does not cover the entire outflow structure .",
    "this is due to the fact that the gas indeed does not get accelerated everywhere , e.g. in the shock regions , but possibly also due to the azimuthal averaging process .",
    "however , the very different results given by the two criteria , in particular in the upper panel of fig.[fig : bp82_26 ] , strongly indicate that the two distinct outflow regions are real .    although the gas in the outflow experiences several internal shocks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:26 - 4 ] ) , the bulk velocity steadily increases within about 2000 au ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zpro26 - 4 ] ) . this can be explained by the fact that acceleration is possible over almost the whole outflow extension ( bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] ) . after experiencing a shock which decreases the outflow speed",
    ", the gas gets reaccelerated again by centrifugal acceleration and/or the toroidal magnetic field pressure .",
    "this happens repeatedly over the whole outflow extension thereby successively increasing the bulk velocity .",
    "this situation markedly differs from episodic jet ejection which also would produce internal shock fronts .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the knotty structure often observed in protostellar jets is not necessarily a consequence of several outflow ejection events but can also result from a continuously fed jet where gas repeatedly shocks and reaccelerates  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .    as already seen in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mag26 - 4 ] the magnetic field lines get straightened very quickly above and below the disc .",
    "we attribute this to the hoop stress produced by the toroidal magnetic field collimating the outflowing gas and therefore also the magnetic field lines .",
    "nevertheless , the gas still gets accelerated centrifugally despite the almost vertical direction of the magnetic field lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_26 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag26 - 4 ] , the largest part of the outflow is dominated by the toroidal magnetic field component .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that over its complete extension the outflow as a whole stays well collimated .    as mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the expansion speed is not constant over time but experiences a relatively sharp increase after about 2000 yr .",
    "we attribute this to a change in the underlying driving mechanism of the outflow . indeed",
    ", analysing the outflow with our criterion given in equation  ( [ eq : crit ] ) shows that within the first 2000 yr purely centrifugal acceleration is not possible indicating that the outflow is mainly driven by the toroidal magnetic pressure .",
    "the expansion speed in this phase is almost the same in the vertical and horizontal direction ( see top panel of fig .  [ fig:26 - 4 ] ) with the outer edge of the bubble coinciding with the position of the accretion shock at the disc edge .",
    "it is only in this initial stage when we call the outflow a magnetic tower flow  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation at 5000 yr in this transient phase there is no acceleration of gas from the disc .",
    "in fact , the gas is accelerated only at the tip of the outflow .",

    "[ fig : mag_52 - 4 ] the magnetic field line structure in the inner region is considered in more detail .",
    "the poloidal field lines have a strongly pronounced hourglass - shaped configuration with a strong radial component .",

    "the failure of the @xcite criterion is not surprising as it was derived for keplerian disc rotation only and therefore does not apply for strongly sub - keplerian discs as it is the case here .",

    "[ fig : bp82_52 - 4 ] ) . in the upper outflow lobe",
    "the grey shaded region fits the outer region of acceleration reasonably well .",
    "although in the lower outflow lobe the agreement is rather poor , it shows that in case of sub - keplerian disc rotation the criterion clearly works better than the 30@xmath38 criterion which would predict outflowing gas everywhere .",
    "furthermore , the result suggest that the bulk of outflowing material , which emerges from radii @xmath46 300 au ( compare upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : mag_52 - 4 ] ) , is launched centrifugally also in this case .",
    "however , in particular in the lower outflow lobe and close the @xmath19-axis , the predicted regions of purely centrifugal acceleration ( grey shaded areas in the left panel ) hardly match the regions of real acceleration ( enclosed by black contours ) . hence , as in the weak field case 26 - 4 , we suppose that in these regions the toroidal magnetic field strongly influences the outflow dynamics . indeed , analysing the outflow with the general criterion given in equation  ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) taking into account @xmath10 ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_52 - 4 ] ) shows that now the grey shaded regions fit the regions of real acceleration much better , in particular close to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "naturally , the agreement is not perfect which is probably due to the azimuthal averaging process and the fact the outflow is not stationary as assumed for the derivation of the criterion .",
    "nevertheless , it agrees remarkably well , demonstrating the importance of @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we tentatively suggest that in this run its influence on the driving is even larger than in run 26 - 4 where the fast gas is mainly driven centrifugally .",
    "next , we consider the reason for the poor collimation of the outflow . as mentioned before ,",
    "outflow collimation is due to the hoop stress produced by @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , we again note that the disc has strongly sub - keplerian rotation due to very efficient initial magnetic braking  . as magnetic braking",
    "basically transfers a part of the rotational energy of the disc into energy of the toroidal magnetic field , one could naively expect @xmath33 in the outflow to be relatively strong and hence the outflow to be well collimated .",
    "however , as already indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_52 - 4 ] , @xmath33 is larger than @xmath34 only in parts of the outflow suggesting a rather moderate toroidal field strength . indeed , comparing the absolute energy content e@xmath48 stored in the toroidal magnetic field of the outflow in",
    "the strong - field run 5.2 - 4 with the weak - field run 26 - 4 after 4000 yr , reveals that e@xmath48 is more than 3 times larger in the latter .",
    "the reason for this is that a significant fraction of the angular momentum is removed by magnetic braking already _ before _ the gas falls onto the disc .",
    "indeed , the disc in run 5.2 - 4 has a 2 times lower specific angular momentum @xmath49 than the disc in run 26 - 4 .",
    "therefore , there is less rotational energy left to transfer into e@xmath48 .",
    "consequently , @xmath33 in the outflow and therefore also the hoop stress responsible for collimation are significantly weaker .",
    "as at the same time the poloidal magnetic field is quite strong in run 5.2 - 4 , collimation gets even more difficult thus resulting in the poorly collimated , sphere - like outflow .",
    "@xcite , studying the interplay of ionising radiation and magnetic fields , find a similar sphere - like outflow structure existing over a timescale of several 10@xmath50 yr . the authors simulated a 1000 m@xmath0 core with a resolution of 98 au and a weaker initial magnetic field ( @xmath51 ) than in our run 5.2 - 4 . due to",
    "the gravitational instability and subsequent fragmentation of the disc as well as the effects of the emerging h  ii regions no well defined keplerian disc builds up in their simulation . as argued above , this and the resulting weaker @xmath33 lead to the development of a poorly collimated outflow . hence , despite different initial conditions the similarities between the outflows observed by @xcite and us are not surprising .",
    "to summarise , due to magnetic braking the gas in the disc in run 5.2 - 4 is rotating relatively slowly .",
    "therefore , @xmath33 generated by rotation is weak resulting in a poorly collimated outflow .      due to computational cost reasons we can not follow the outflow evolution over more than a few 10@xmath52 yr .",
    "nevertheless , we can try to estimate whether these outflows will persist over time or fall back due to the gravitational attraction of the central object and the ram pressure of the infalling gas . for this purpose",
    "we compare the outflow velocity @xmath29 with two basic velocities .",
    "the first one to compare with is the escape velocity @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass of the star + disc system . for the outflow to escape the gravitational potential of the central object @xmath29 has to exceed @xmath55 . to take into account the effect of thermal and magnetic pressure in the surrounding gas which",
    "also might slow down the outflow , we furthermore compare the outflow velocity to the poloidal component of the fast magnetosonic velocity @xmath56 in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel ] we show the azimuthal average of outflow velocity @xmath29 and the contours where @xmath29 equals the two velocities mentioned above in a slice along the @xmath19-axis for run 26 - 4 ( left panel ) and run 5.2 - 4 ( right panel ) . we first concentrate on run 26 - 4 . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rprofile ] , below 2000 au the highest velocities occur close to the @xmath19-axis .",

    "[ fig : velslice ] ) .",
    "we attribute the higher value of @xmath60 at a radius of 300 au to somewhat lower densities in this region ( compare bottom panel of fig .",

    "once the gas reaches a significantly super - alfvnic speed the flow can not be stabilised any more leading to instabilities and shocks which in turn reduce the velocity to trans - alfvnic speeds  ( see * ? ? ?",

    "interestingly , the gas speed is comparable to @xmath58 and not to @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath33 has to be taken into account .",
    "this indicates that @xmath34 is not the main agent stabilising the flow although it certainly contributes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite show that jets with a toroidal magnetic field are even more stable than jets with a purely poloidal field . in our case",
    "we therefore suppose that the stability of the jet is significantly enhanced by @xmath33 .    despite ongoing fragmentation of the protostellar disc ,",
    "the driving of the outflow seems not to decline over time .",
    "as furthermore @xmath29 is significantly larger than @xmath55 and @xmath61 , it can be expected that the outflow in run 26 - 4 will escape the gravitational potential of the central star / disc - system and finally will leave the core even when taking into account the ram pressure of the infalling gas .",

    "therefore , when taking into account the additional deceleration of the outflow by the ram pressure of the infalling material , it might be possible that the outflow will re - collapse to the star / disc - system .    to summarise , the outflows of the two simulations presented so far do not only differ in their morphology and their kinematics but possibly also in their longer term evolution .",
    "the well collimated outflow is likely to overcome the gravitational potential of the central protostar and leave the core whereas the sphere - like , slowly expanding outflow might be only a short - lived , transient feature in the very early phase of massive star formation possibly recollapsing again .",
    "so far only the outflows in the runs 26 - 4 and 5.2 - 4 have been considered in detail .",
    "we have chosen these particular runs as they give representative examples for the outflows observed in the other simulations .",
    "the remaining outflows reveal qualitative similarities to one of the two outflows presented before .",
    "one of the main results of the previous sections is that the different morphologies can be attributed to the different velocity structure in the disc resulting in different radial positions where the outflows are launched and variations in the strength of the hoop stress ( @xmath33 ) responsible for outflow collimation . to further confirm this , in the following we consider the whole set of simulations and connect the outflow properties to the properties of the protostellar disc .",
    "we start with the remaining weakly magnetised runs .",
    "the outflows in the runs 26 - 20 , 26 - 0.4 and 26 - 0.04 show similar morphologies as the outflow in run 26 - 4 .",
    "they are reasonably well collimated with collimation factors between 2 in run 26 - 20 and @xmath8 4.5 in run 26 - 0.4 and have outflow velocities preferentially parallel to the @xmath19-axis .",
    "interestingly , in the runs 10 - 20 and 5.2 - 20 , whose outflows are rather poorly collimated , a fast and well collimated jet close to the @xmath19-axis develops after about 2500 yr embedded in the slowly expanding , poorly collimated outflow .",
    "similar applies to run 26 - 20 with the difference that by the end of the simulation the initial , slowly expanding , poorly collimated outflow is overtaken by the faster , more collimated jet . for demonstrative purposes , in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 - 20 ] we show the situation in run 10 - 20 after 4000 yr .",
    "we mention that similar outflows consisting of two distinct components , an outer , slowly expanding and an inner , fast component have recently also been observed in low - mass star formation simulations  @xcite .    analysing the magnetic field line structure in the runs",
    "mentioned before reveals situations similar to that in run 26 - 4 . in the inner region close to the symmetry axis of the jet , where the gas gets accelerated ,",
    "the magnetic field is only weakly dominated by the toroidal field component , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "furthermore , the field lines at the disc surface are inclined by more than 30@xmath38 w.r.t . to the vertical axis . as the discs rotate with keplerian velocities",
    "just like in run 26 - 4 or as in run 5.2 - 20 with at least about half the keplerian speed , we therefore suppose that the gas gets launched from the discs by centrifugal acceleration . applying our outflow criterion",
    "( equation  ( [ eq : crit ] ) ) for these runs shows that above the disc the region where purely centrifugal acceleration works is not as extended as in run 26 - 4 ( fig .",

    ", we can fit the outflow regions by far better .",
    "hence , considering the jets as purely centrifugally driven might not be an appropriate choice too far from the disc .",
    "the evidence shows that the pressure gradient of the toroidal magnetic field contributes significantly to the gas acceleration although , as mentioned before , the launching from the disc itself is most likely to due to centrifugal acceleration .",
    "the application of the two criteria also suggest that the dynamics of the outer , slowly expanding outflows in the runs 26 - 20 , 10 - 20 and 5.2 - 20 are mainly determined by @xmath10 .",
    "all remaining runs show poorly collimated , low velocity outflows with outflowing gas emerging almost radially at radii @xmath46 100 au and gas infall close to the @xmath19-axis . furthermore ,",
    "the magnetic field line properties in the centre are similar to run 5.2 - 4 and the protostellar discs driving the outflows are all clearly sub - keplerian . moreover , applying the outflow criteria derived in section  [ sec : crit ]",
    "gives very similar results as for run 5.2 .",
    "therefore we conclude that in these runs the outflow driving mechanism is very similar to that in run 5.2 - 4 , i.e. gas is launched centrifugally from the disc at large radii ( @xmath63 au ) with support by @xmath33 . at larger distances @xmath33 is mainly responsible for the further acceleration ( see section  [ sec : launch52 ] ) . to remind the reader ,",
    "the poor collimation is a consequence of the weak toroidal magnetic field in the outflow and of the large launching radii .",

    "this clearly demonstrates that for a collimated , high velocity jet to form a disc with ( almost ) keplerian rotation is necessary .",
    "in contrast , if the disc is rotating strongly sub - keplerian , both outflow speed and collimation decrease significantly .",
    "next , we consider the influence of the initial conditions on global outflow properties like mass and momentum .",
    "the results for each simulation are listed in table  [ tab : mout ] . for the calculation of mass and momentum",
    "we only take into account gas more than 47 au above or below the midplane . by doing so",
    ", we avoid the outflow quantities to be affected by material in the protostellar disc . for the momentum we only consider the @xmath19-component as this is its preferred direction .",
    "the outflow masses are of the order of 0.1 - 1 m@xmath0 significantly lower than the sink masses ( see also section  [ sec : fluxes ] ) . with momenta of the order of 0.1 - 1 m@xmath0 km s@xmath2",
    "we obtain average velocities of a few km s@xmath2 lower than typically found in observations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section  [ sec : obs ] for a detailed discussion ) .    in general ,",
    "for a fixed magnetic field strength both centrifugal and @xmath10 dominated acceleration predict that the power of the outflow should increase with the rotation speed of the protostellar disc .",
    "thus , for larger amounts of initial rotational energy and hence faster disc rotation , the outflow mass and momentum are expected be higher as well . indeed , comparing runs with equal @xmath5 in table  [ tab : mout ]",
    "reveals that except for run 26 - 20 the outflows are in general more powerful for higher @xmath26 .",
    "we suppose that in run 26 - 20 the generation of the outflow might be slightly delayed as the material falling onto the disc has a high excess of angular momentum which has to be removed before moving further inwards .",
    "therefore , the accretion rate and consequently also the outflow rates @xmath67 and @xmath68 are lower .",
    "interestingly , there is no clear trend recognizable in @xmath67 and @xmath68 when considering simulations with fixed @xmath26 but varying @xmath5 . in general , for runs with @xmath69 5.2 there seem to be only small variations within a factor of about 5 in @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( see table  [ tab : mout ] ) .",
    "we note that we exclude run 26 - 20 in this consideration as it does not fit in this trend . for strong magnetic fields ( @xmath5 = 2.6 )",
    ", however , there seems to be a rapid decline in outflow power .",
    "naively , it could be expected that the power of the outflows would increase with magnetic field strength .",
    "this is not the case since for stronger magnetic fields disc rotation gets more and more sub - keplerian  .",
    "this results in a weaker centrifugal acceleration and a weaker toroidal magnetic field responsible for further accelerating the outflow .",
    "therefore , for both driving mechanisms the outflow power is expected to decrease for strongly sub - keplerian discs in agreement with our observations .",
    "however , we emphasise that , as the outflow morphologies differ significantly between the individual simulations , the results of this comparison have to be taken with care .    in summary , we find that the generation of a fast ( @xmath70 10 km s@xmath2 ) , well collimated jet depends on the build - up of a keplerian disc . in these jets",
    "the gas is most likely launched centrifugally from the disc . somewhat above / below the disc",

    "@xmath33 quickly plays an important role in accelerating the outflow further .",
    "although the morphologies are very different , the global properties like mass and momentum vary only within a factor of 5 showing a decrease towards high magnetic field strengths .",

    "although being somewhat higher , in general the observed range roughly agrees with theoretical estimates of @xmath8 0.1 obtained for the centrifugal acceleration mechanism  @xcite . the high value of @xmath72 at @xmath76 500 au is due to the circulation flow in the outer parts of the outflow ( r @xmath31 200 - 300 au , see bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mag26 - 4 ] ) . as the outflow speed of this material is not sufficient to escape the gravitational potential , it falls back to the disc thus not contributing to the outflow rate at larger distances .",

    "the values have a mean of @xmath8 0.3 which agrees very well with other numerical work  @xcite and is only slightly higher than analytical estimates of @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "however , the scatter of the individual values is significant ranging from about 0.02 in run 26 - 0.04 up to 0.9 in run 10 - 20 .",
    "interestingly , run 26 - 20 has a value of @xmath72 around 0.3 in accordance with the other runs although the absolute values in this simulation are very small ( see table  [ tab : mout ] ) .",
    "this confirms the explanation given in section  [ sec : global ] that in run 26 - 20 the whole outflow ejection process is slowed down due to the high excess of angular momentum which causes lower accretion rates and in turn also lower outflow rates .",
    "moreover , @xmath72 is generally higher for higher @xmath26 . as discussed in section  [ sec : global ] , this is a consequence of the fact that the outflow power increases with @xmath26 whereas at the same time the accretion rates decrease due to an enhanced centrifugal support . for varying @xmath5 , however , there is no clear trend in @xmath72 recognizable except a possible drop - off for the highly magnetised runs with @xmath5 = 2.6 which was already observed in section  [ sec : global ] for the absolute outflow quantities .",
    "although the derived values of @xmath72 are in general somewhat higher than analytical predictions , they agree reasonably well with observational results ranging from about 0.1 to 0.3  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a ratio of @xmath8 0.3 is often used to estimate accretion rates of massive protostar from observed outflow mass rates  @xcite . as",
    "this value fits reasonably well over a wide range of initial conditions , we suppose that accretion rates derived that way seem to be reliable .",
    "( see table  [ tab : models ] ) .",
    "equal symbols denote equal initial rotational energies .",
    "the calculated values scatter around a mean of @xmath8 0.3 in rough agreement with theoretical estimates.,width=317 ]    our analysis presented in the sections  [ sec : launch26 ] and [ sec : launch52 ] suggests that in all simulations the gas is launched from the disc by centrifugal acceleration  . at larger distances above / below the disc",
    "the pressure of the toroidal magnetic field significantly contributes to the acceleration of the gas .",
    "although @xcite describe outflows whose dynamics are determined by the toroidal magnetic field , we emphasise that our outflows are for the most parts ( in time and space ) not such so - called magnetic tower flows . in fact , the effect of @xmath10 is also implicitly contained in the mhd wind theory ( equation  ( [ eq : crit2 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , it is more appropriate to consider our outflows in the framework of mhd wind theory as it contains both centrifugal acceleration and the magnetic pressure ( @xmath10 ) effects . in such a magneto - centrifugally driven wind",
    "the gas is ejected from the disc surface and then gets accelerated towards larger heights .",
    "in contrast , in a magnetic tower  @xcite gas gets accelerated only at the tip of the outflow",
    " there is no sustained mass loss coming from the disc .",
    "tower flows are transient phases that arise only in the earliest stages of outflows .    for simulations with weak initial magnetic fields or high rotational energies",
    "the situation is as follows : shortly after the formation of the first sink particle , a sub - keplerian disc builds up driving a slow ( @xmath8 1 km s@xmath2 ) outflow whose driving is probably dominated by the magnetic pressure .",
    "as soon as a well defined large - scale keplerian disc develops , in the inner region a fast ( @xmath8 10 km s@xmath2 ) , well collimated jet is launched by centrifugal acceleration . at larger heights and radii",
    "@xmath46 200 au , however , @xmath33 significantly contributes to the acceleration .",
    "an outer , slowly expanding outflow component is still clearly visible at the end of the simulations 26 - 20 , 10 - 20 and 5.2 - 20 ( see fig .  [ fig:10 - 20 ] ) .",
    "such outflows consisting of two components , an outer , slowly expanding and an inner , fast component have also been observed in simulations of low - mass star formation  @xcite .    for runs with strong magnetic fields , the protostellar discs are sub - keplerian all the time due to strong magnetic braking  .",
    "therefore , during the time covered by our simulations no fast , central jet component develops and only a slowly expanding , poorly collimated bubble is present .",
    "the gas seems to be mainly launched centrifugally although the toroidal magnetic field has probably a large impact on driving the outflow already close to the disc .",
    "we tried to clarify the situation by applying a criterion derived in section  [ sec : crit ] depending on the actual position , the protostellar mass and the local rotation speed ( equation  ( [ eq : crit ] ) ) .",
    "in general , using the criterion for the present simulations indicates that it is applicable despite the constraints like axis - symmetry , stationarity and corotation assumed for its derivation .",
    "we show that for strongly sub - keplerian discs it acceptably fits the region where the outflow gets launched ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : bp82_52 - 4 ] ) in contrast to the @xcite criterion which fails when analysing the sub - keplerian cases .",
    "together with the results from run 26 - 4 this demonstrates that simply considering the inclination of the magnetic field w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath19-axis might not be sufficient to determine the driving mechanism nor the region where the outflow gets launched .",
    "on the one hand even for inclination angles smaller than 30@xmath38 the outflow can be driven centrifugally ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mag26 - 4 ] and [ fig : bp82_26 ] ) whereas on the other hand there are situations where purely centrifugal acceleration does not work despite inclination angles larger than 30@xmath38 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mag_52 - 4 ] and [ fig : bp82_52 - 4 ] ) .",
    "again , we emphasise that in all runs the mechanism responsible for outflow launching is centrifugal acceleration . only at larger heights",
    "do the effects of the toroidal magnetic field come into play .",
    "the situation is therefore not such that the outflow is either driven centrifugally or by the toroidal magnetic pressure .",
    "such a classification often found in literature is an oversimplification not describing the situation appropriately as both processes play an important role .",
    "we have shown that there is a continuous transition , from centrifugal dominated acceleration to acceleration dominated by @xmath10 .",
    "these two regimes are both implied in the solution of the stationary mhd equations presented in section  [ sec : crit ]  ( see also section 4.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the different outflow morphologies mainly result from the varying strength of @xmath33 responsible for collimation as for strongly sub - keplerian cases @xmath33 is too weak to properly collimate the outflows .    as mentioned before , several authors have simulated outflows consisting of two different components . however , their conclusions as which component is driven by which mechanism partly contradict each other . on the one hand , several authors  @xcite claim that the outer , larger scale outflow is driven by the magnetic pressure  @xcite whereas the inner , fast outflow embedded in the first one is considered as a centrifugally driven jet  . on the other hand , @xcite and",
    "@xcite find the situation to be exactly vice versa .",
    "all authors argue on the basis of an analysis of the field line structure such as the ratio of @xmath10 to @xmath34 or the field line inclination w.r.t . the protostellar disc .",
    "as we argued above , this kind of consideration alone can be misleading which might have caused the contradictory results .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to apply the criterion derived in this work to confirm the results in an independent way .",
    "this was recently done by  @xcite in simulations of low - mass cores .",
    "the results support our interpretation of a magnetic pressure driven , outer outflow component and a centrifugally driven , inner component .",
    "furthermore , this demonstrates the applicability of our criterion in equal measure to low - mass and high - mass protostellar outflows without any restrictions .",
    "@xcite studying the influence of the initial magnetic field strength on the formation of outflows around low - mass stars find striking similarities to our results , i.e. a well collimated , fast outflow component embedded in a slowly expanding component for weak magnetic fields and a poorly collimated outflow for strong fields .",
    "their interpretation of a centrifugally driven wind for the latter case and a magnetic tower flow for the former case , however , is in opposition to our interpretation .",
    "hence , it would be interesting to apply our criterion derived here to confirm this conclusion in another way .",
    "differences might also result from the fact that @xcite consider a low - mass core which is less gravitationally unstable .",
    "therefore , in particular in the strongly magnetised case the situation might be less sub - keplerian possibly leading to different results .",
    "in general , our results agree remarkable well with those of low - mass star formation simulations even over the wide range of initial conditions covered in out work .",
    "however , the good agreement between our and the low - mass case results could not be expected a priori as in contrast to low - mass cores the cores presented here are highly gravitationally unstable ( about 56 jeans masses ) . therefore the dynamics and timescales of the whole system can differ significantly from low - mass cores .",
    "another difference , though not covered in this work , is the influence of initial turbulence and radiative feedback of the protostars .",
    "however , as we are still in a very early evolutionary stage , we suppose that the effect of radiation is still rather limited .",
    "in contrast , the influence of turbulence which we will examine in a subsequent paper is expected to be significant  ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .      for typical massive star forming regions",
    "the observed mass - to - flux ratios are usually only slightly supercritical , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "based on the results obtained in this work , the question arises how well collimated , fast outflows frequently observed around high - mass protostellar objects can form  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we showed that the formation of such outflows is linked to the build - up of keplerian discs , the question reduces to how the magnetic braking efficiency can be reduced allowing keplerian discs to form .",
    "a possible solution is provided by the poorly collimated outflows themselves evacuating the region above and below the disc therefore significantly reducing the magnetic braking efficiency  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a misalignment between the rotation axis and the initial magnetic field  @xcite or non - ideal mhd effects like ambipolar diffusion , ohmic dissipation or the hall effect could reduce the magnetic braking efficiency , in particular in later stages  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these possibilities lead to a successive build - up of keplerian discs during the protostellar evolution towards class i / ii objects , hence allowing the generation of well collimated , high - velocity jets  .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zpro26 - 4 ] , the position - velocity ( pv ) diagram shows a typical ",
    "hubble law-like behaviour also seen in observations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an behaviour is a natural outcome of several wind models like the jet - driven bow shock model or the wind - driven shell model  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an overview ) . however , the comparison between our results and those models is not straightforward as in those wind models the velocity increase with distance is only an apparent and no real acceleration .",
    "this apparent acceleration is a consequence of the inclination of the outflow w.r.t .",
    "the plane of the sky and the fact that mainly gas swept up in the bow shock and not inside the outflow lobe contributes to the observable emission .",
    "in contrast , in our case the observed acceleration is real and is mainly due to the gas inside the bow shock structure whereas the material in the shock itself has mainly negative velocities ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : rprofile ] ) .",
    "hence , an observed acceleration of the bulk velocity in outflows can also be real and not only due to projection effect .    however , an interesting point made by those wind models is the fact that the outflows partly consist of gas entrained from the ambient medium .",
    "we tested this statement by implementing a passive mass scalar in run 26 - 4 which reveals an outflow morphology similar to that assumed in the wind models .",
    "this mass scalar is set to 1 in a disc of 75 au above and below the midplane and gets advected with the gas .",
    "hence , we can test how much of the gas in the outflow stems from this disc and how much from the ambient medium .",
    "the analysis shows that by the end of the simulation about 92% of the gas mass in the outflow stems from the disc .",
    "hence , most of the gas gets accelerated from the bottom of the outflow up to the tip and only a small part is entrained from the ambient medium .",
    "a possible explanation might be the high infall velocities which are a result of the highly gravitationally unstable configuration .",
    "we suggest that the gas hitting the bow shock it is mainly deflected sidewards and gets channelled downwards along the shock rather than getting stuck and being entrained with the outflow . the situation might change if the core is less gravitationally unstable and the infall velocities are smaller .",
    "we tentatively suppose that in this case it is more likely that the gas gets entrained by the outflow .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suppose that outflows create low density regions along the polar direction which aid the formation of massive stars by channelling the radiation outwards , therefore diminishing the radiation pressure and allowing accretion to proceed . as seen in bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mag26 - 4 ] , the material ejected from the disc indeed carves a low density region into the vicinity",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether the density decrease in our simulations is sufficient to allow radiation produced by the protostar to escape efficiently as recently seen in radiation - hydrodynamical simulations by  @xcite .",
    "furthermore it would be of interest to see to what extent the radiation pressure would decollimate the outflow as proposed recently by @xcite on the basis of 2-dimensional jet simulations .      in table",
    "[ tab : mout ] we have listed the mass and momentum outflow rates of all runs performed .",
    "the calculated mass - loss rates vary between @xmath79 and @xmath80 m@xmath0 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is in agreement with typically observed mass loss rates in high - mass star forming regions ranging from 10@xmath81 up to a few 10@xmath82 m@xmath0 yr@xmath2 although at the lower end  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "like our simulations those observations refer to the very early stage of massive star formation although the calculated dynamical timescales are of the order of a few 10@xmath52 up to a few 10@xmath50 yr , typically somewhat larger than ours .",
    "however , as for a large fraction of the observed systems no signs of h  ii - regions have been detected , the outflows are probably still magneto - centrifugally driven winds which is why our mass - loss rates are comparable .",
    "the calculated momentum outflow rates in our models range from @xmath83 to @xmath84 m@xmath0 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 .",
    "this is at the lower end usually reported by observations of massive protostellar outflows finding @xmath68 of the order of 10@xmath1 to 10@xmath85 m@xmath0 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the outflow velocity in centrifugally driven jets is coupled to the rotation velocity  @xcite , the maximum outflow velocities which can be reached in our simulations , are of the order of 10 km s@xmath2 ( see equation  ( [ eq : vrotmax ] ) ) , about one order of magnitude lower than typically observed .",
    "therefore , the lower values of @xmath68 in our runs are not surprising .",
    "however , we expect our momentum outflow rates to increase and to become comparable to observations if we run the simulations over comparable timescales of a few 10@xmath50 yr and with a higher resolution which allows for faster outflow material arising from deeper in the gravitational potential well",
    ".    observational results on outflow morphologies are still somewhat ambiguous .",
    "one the one hand , outflows around massive protostars are usually found to be less collimated than their low mass counterparts revealing collimation factors of the order of 1 - 2  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , @xcite also find highly collimated , massive outflows with collimation factors as high as 10 . based on this",
    ", @xcite propose an evolutionary scenario in which well collimated , magnetically driven outflows occur in the very early phase of massive star formation . in their further evolution",
    "the outflows get progressively less collimated due to the build - up of h  ii - regions . according to this ,",
    "early - stage outflows as presented here should all be more or less well collimated .",
    "obviously this is not the case , as only runs with a weak magnetic field ( @xmath5 = 26 ) reveal well collimated outflows with collimation factors up to 4.5 .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that the collimation not only depends on the evolutionary stage but also on the initial conditions of the molecular cloud core , in particular on the magnetic field strength .",
    "our results suggest that during the very early stages ( 10@xmath52 - 10@xmath50 yr ) outflows in typically magnetised , massive cores ( @xmath6 ) should rather be poorly collimated with collimation factors of 1 - 2 instead of 5 - 10 .",
    "this agrees with a number of observations of outflows around young massive protostellar objects  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we suggest that in the earliest stage , i.e. even before the scenario described by @xcite applies , outflows are indeed rather poorly collimated except in case of an unusually weak magnetic field . in their further evolution , however , the collimation will increase quickly due to the development of a fast , central jet coupled to the build - up of a keplerian disc .",
    "such a behaviour can in particular be seen in the runs 26 - 20 , 10 - 20 and 5.2 - 20 .",
    "hence we suggest that , beside tracing later stages as proposed by @xcite , poorly collimated outflows around massive protostars could also trace the very early stage of massive star formation .",
    "hence , one might have to be careful when trying to infer the stage of star formation from the collimation of the outflow .    to confirm such an evolutionary scenario as proposed here",
    ", observations of the earliest stage of massive star formation would be necessary in combination with magnetic field measurements .",
    "unfortunately , to date such observations are difficult to obtain and therefore rather rare .",
    "however , there is an interesting observation which supports the picture of very early stage , poorly collimated outflows successively collimating over time . observing two spatially adjacent , massive protostars in the star forming region w75n , @xcite and @xcite find the younger of the two having a spherical outflow whereas the more evolved protostar has a well collimated outflow . due to the close proximity to each other",
    ", the authors expect the environmental conditions to be very similar and hence not to cause the different morphologies .",
    "therefore the authors conclude that the differences are rather a consequence of different evolutionary stages and that the younger , poorly collimated outflow is possibly only a transient feature .",
    "this interpretation fits perfectly into our evolutionary scenario in which after an initial phase a poorly collimated outflow gets overtaken by a well collimated jet .",
    "we have studied the collapse of massive molecular cloud cores with varying initial rotational and magnetic energies . the mass - to - flux ratios of the magnetically supercritical cores range from 2.6 up to 26 .",
    "the cores have rotational energies well below the gravitational energy and contain about 56 jeans masses .",
    "hence , they are highly gravitationally unstable and possible sites of massive star formation . in this work we focussed on the launching mechanism and the properties of early outflows and jets . furthermore , based on the stationary , axisymmetric mhd equations we derived a generalised criterion to determine the launching mechanism of the outflows .",
    "the criterion is applicable to the whole outflow region and to situations with sub - keplerian disc rotation . in the following we summarise our main findings .    1 .",
    "we show that our outflow criterion ( equations  [ eq : crit2 ] and [ eq : crit ] ) can successfully distinguish between the different driving mechanisms and that it works over the complete extension of the outflows .",
    "we discuss an example where the outflow is centrifugally driven up to about 800 au thereby demonstrating that considering only the ratio of @xmath33 to @xmath34 is not sufficient to determine the driving mechanism .",
    "furthermore , we successfully apply the criterion to runs with strongly sub - keplerian protostellar discs where the frequently used 30@xmath38-criterion for the inclination of magnetic field lines fails .",
    "2 .   depending on the initial magnetic field strength two types of outflows are observed : well collimated , high - velocity jets for runs with weak magnetic fields ( @xmath65 ) and high rotational energies ( @xmath66 ) and poorly collimated , slowly expanding outflows for runs with strong fields .",
    "the development of fast jets is coupled to the build - up of keplerian discs . in none of the strongly magnetised runs with strongly sub - keplerian disc rotation a well collimated jet is observed .",
    "3 .   in all runs centrifugal acceleration is responsible for launching the gas from the discs . with increasing distance from the disc",
    "the pressure gradient of the toroidal magnetic field progressively contributes to the further acceleration of the gas . for runs with sub - keplerian discs the outflows",
    "are centrifugally dominated at large radii ( @xmath46 100 au ) where gravity is sufficiently reduced to be overcome by the centrifugal force . in these outflows",
    "@xmath10 seems to play a more important role in the driving than in the fast jets .",
    "the morphological differences of the outflows are mainly due to the varying strength of the hoop stress responsible for outflow collimation . for sub - keplerian discs the generation of @xmath33 happens more slowly , so that their corresponding outflows are less collimated .",
    "we show that an outflow can be maintained despite the fragmentation of the protostellar disc .",
    "furthermore , knotty outflow structures can also be produced in continuously fed jets by gas repeatedly experiencing shocks and reaccelerating again even far from the disc .",
    "for such outflows the toroidal magnetic field seems to contribute significantly to the overall stabilisation .",
    "the observed mass and momentum outflow rates are of the order of 10@xmath1 m@xmath0 yr@xmath2 and 10@xmath1 m@xmath0 km s@xmath2 yr@xmath2 , respectively , in reasonable agreement with observational results .",
    "the calculated mass ejection / accretion ratios scatter around a mean of 0.3 in agreement with both theoretical estimates and observational results . 7 .   based on the results of the strongly magnetised simulations ( @xmath6 )",
    ", we suggest an evolutionary scenario where a poorly collimated outflow is typical for the very early stage of massive star formation . over time",
    "the outflow collimation will increase due to the development of a well collimated , fast jet overtaking the slowly expanding outflow .",
    "this picture is also supported by observations .",
    "furthermore , analysing the sphere - like , slowly expanding outflows suggest that they are possibly only transient features which might re - collapse during their further evolution .",
    "we showed that a simple approach such as the value of @xmath35 or the inclination of magnetic field lines is not sufficient to determine the launching mechanism of outflows .",
    "this could be the reason for the partly conflicting results found in literature .",
    "we therefore strongly suggest to use a self - consistent criterion which is applicable to the whole outflow region as well as sub - keplerian discs frequently found in numerical simulations  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . moreover , we emphasise that a separation in purely centrifugally or magnetic pressure driven winds is probably an oversimplification not describing the situation appropriately .",
    "we showed that magneto - centrifugal acceleration has two regimes , a centrifugally dominated and a @xmath10 dominated one and that within a realistic outflow there is a continuous transition from one regime to the other .",
    "a growing number of observations of discs and well collimated , bipolar outflows around high - mass protostars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) support a high - mass star formation scenario via disc accretion similar to low - mass star formation . on the other hand",
    ", observations also show that prestellar cores with masses ranging from 2 - 2000 m@xmath0 are usually only slightly supercritical with @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "together with our numerical results this suggest that typically there should be no well - collimated jets in the very early stages of high - mass star formation but rather sphere - like , slowly expanding outflow structures . as discussed in the paper , the question of how well collimated jets are generated breaks down to the problem of how keplerian discs can be formed in highly magnetised cores .",
    "for this to happen , effects in the later evolution of the system are required that reduce the efficiency of magnetic braking .",
    "in particular , the initial , slowly expanding outflows as well as non - ideal mhd effects could accomplish , this resulting in a successive growth of discs and the development of well collimated jets over time .",
