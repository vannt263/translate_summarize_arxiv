    "the radiative decay of a mesonic state has long been argued to be crucial in the determination of the nature of the state  @xcite . for instance , the non - observation of the @xmath5 decaying into two photons has been used to support its dominant glue nature  @xcite . in this sense",
    "the radiative decay has also been advocated as a tool to determine the molecular nature of many mesonic and baryonic states @xcite .",
    "the dynamical generation of many mesonic states using chiral unitary dynamics @xcite has stimulated further studies of these decay modes of mesonic states .",
    "though scalar mesons have been for long in the list of dynamically generated mesons from the interaction of two pseudoscalar mesons @xcite , it has been only very recently that the systems of two vector mesons have been investigated @xcite , and many dynamically generated states have appeared which have been associated with known resonances of the pdg @xcite . in this sense",
    "the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 were generated in @xcite from the interaction of the nonet of vector mesons with itself .",
    "similarly , some d * mesons are generated in @xcite , the @xmath11 among other states is generated in @xcite and some hidden charm states , some of which could be identified with the new x , y , z resonances recently reported , were also found in @xcite . the task of studying several radiative decay modes is important for these states in view of the fact that many of them have traditionally been accommodated within quark models without much difficulty @xcite .",
    "support for the new nature of these states comes gradually from studies of different decay modes . in this sense in @xcite the radiative decay of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 resonances into @xmath12 , was studied and good results compared with experiment were found .",
    "these studies were extended to the su(3 ) states , and also good agreement with experiment was found in the cases where there was available data for comparison @xcite .",
    "the study of the @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 decay in @xcite , and @xmath16 decay into @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xcite has given extra support to the claimed nature of these resonances as vector - vector bound states or resonances .",
    "in this paper we pose a new challenge to this idea by investigating the decay of the dynamically generated states of @xcite into a pseudoscalar meson and one baryon .",
    "as we shall see , the decay proceeds via anomalous interaction terms which involve two vectors and a pseudoscalar meson , and thus one is exploring dynamics quite different than the one needed in other alternative studies , like in quark models .",
    "although there are not many data to compare , we shall see that the agreement with them is satisfactory , within theoretical and experimental uncertainties , and the results obtained should encourage further theoretical and experimental studies in other sectors , like charm or hidden charm mesons .",
    "in this work we study the radiative decay of the vv dynamically generated resonances found in @xcite into p@xmath0 . in table",
    "[ tab : geng ] , we display the masses and widths obtained in that work and the experimental counterpart of each resonance in the assignment made in @xcite .",
    "we see in this table that eleven resonances were found , five of them were associated with resonances that appear in the pdg @xcite .",
    "first of all , we consider all the possible cases of spin - parity of the initial meson in table [ tab : geng ] : in case we had an initial meson with @xmath21 , the angular momentum between the pseudoscalar meson and photon should be @xmath22 , which implies negative final parity , and is not allowed . in the language of photon multipoles",
    "this corresponds to an m0 transition , which does not exist .",
    "the rest of the resonances in table [ tab : geng ] are either with or without strangeness .",
    "the ones without strangeness except for those of @xmath23 have positive c - parity which does not allow the decay into @xmath24 .",
    "this leaves non vanishing decay rates only for the @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath10 , with only this latter one having a clear experimental counterpart , the @xmath10 . in the present work we concentrate on this latter case , where there are also experimental data in the pdg for its decay into p@xmath0 : @xmath28    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      decay . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] we show the two kinds of feynman diagrams that lead to the decay of a resonance into p@xmath0 in the vv molecular picture that combines hgs ( hidden local gauge symmetry ) @xcite and unitarity @xcite .",

    "this anomalous vvp interaction accounts for a process that does not preserve intrinsic parity , and can be obtained from the gauged wess - zumino term ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , as the relevant energy becomes larger , the role of the anomalous contribution becomes more important as it contains momentum factors ( see eq .",
    "( [ lag3 ] ) ) .",
    "this has also been seen in works on the radiative decays of scalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the vvp lagrangian is @xcite : @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the following subsections we evaluate the two different kind of diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppv ] we show the first diagram to compute in charge basis with explicit momentum . in what follows",
    ", we shall consider the @xmath3 at rest .",
    "first of all , we need the coupling of the resonance @xmath3 to @xmath65 .",
    "this coupling is given by the approach of @xcite , where the coupling is calculated as the residue of the @xmath66 amplitude in the pole position of the resonance ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : new ] ) , which close to a pole can be expressed as : @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "we can see in this amplitude , by looking at the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : new ] , that the coupling of the resonance to a @xmath33 channel is given by @xmath69 , @xmath70 or @xmath71 corresponding to one of the channels @xmath31 , @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "these couplings are given in table [ tab : geng2 ] in the isospin basis and we have to multiply them for the correspondent clebsch gordan coefficient : @xmath74     decay in the @xmath75 channel with a @xmath64 vertex . ]    the isospin coefficient is denoted as @xmath76 .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ lag1 ] ) , ( [ lag2 ] ) , ( [ lag3 ] ) and ( [ lag4 ] ) we can write the vertices involved in the diagram of fig . [ fig : ppv ] as @xmath77 with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and the coefficients @xmath76 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are : @xmath87 , @xmath88 mev , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 respectively .",
    "the @xmath92 conversion essentially replaces , up to a constant , @xmath93 by @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , we can write the amplitude of the diagram depicted in fig . [ fig : ppv ] as @xmath95 with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ". we should be consistent with the approximation done in @xcite , where @xmath100 , which implies that @xmath101 .",
    "this means that the @xmath102 and @xmath103 indices should be spatial and also that the @xmath104 terms in the sum over vector polarizations should be neglected . for convenience",
    ", we will keep them as covariant indices and will consider them as spatial indices at the end .",
    "thus , after summing over polarizations @xmath105",

    "( [ eq : lor ] ) with the correspondent indices , we see that the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lor ] ) leads to a term proportional to @xmath112 this term vanishes when one contracts the antisymmetric operator @xmath113 with the symmetric @xmath114 .",
    "this is a welcome feature because this term of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) was the only one that is divergent .",
    "the fifth term , @xmath115 , leads to terms proportional to @xmath116 , and therefore it also vanishes . the third term , @xmath117 , is the only one that remains ,",
    "but we can still simplify it a little bit .",
    "the integral in eq .",

    "let us split the factor @xmath119 in two terms @xmath120 the last term is zero since it is a product of an antisymmetric operator with a symmetric one .",
    "in addition , the presence of @xmath121 forces @xmath122 , which makes the first term also disappear .",
    "now we must evaluate the @xmath123 coefficient .",
    "let us use the formula of the feynman parametrization for @xmath124 @xmath125 ^ 3}\\ .\\label{eq : fein}\\ ] ] for the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) , we can use the above parametrization with @xmath126 besides this , we define a new variable @xmath127 , such that the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) can be expressed as @xmath128 with @xmath129 > from eq .",
    "( [ eq : int2 ] ) , we must take the @xmath130 term .",
    "therefore , @xmath131 now we still can perform the integral in the @xmath132 variable analytically : @xmath133 and finally , we get @xmath134 and the amplitude of the diagram of fig .",

    "[ fig:3v ] we show this diagram with the explicit momenta in the case of the @xmath65 intermediate state .",

    "( [ lag2 ] ) .",

    "the way to proceed is very similar to that of the previous subsection , with the only difference in the use of the lorentz condition , @xmath144 .",
    "now , we get two kinds of integrals",

    "the second integral is @xmath148 which takes the form @xmath149 the last two terms are zero since @xmath150 , and the first one disappears because it gives rise to the factor @xmath151 . the final amplitude is a function of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 coefficients , and it can be expressed as @xmath154 with @xmath155 and @xmath156    the sum of the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ fig : ppv ] and [ fig:3v ] , from eqs .",

    "@xmath1 , we need to evaluate the squared amplitude summing over polarizations , i. e. , @xmath159 .",
    "the sum over the polarizations of the photon @xmath160 leads to a factor @xmath161 .",
    "in addition , products of the antisymmetric @xmath162 operators appear , for what we make use of the rule @xmath163 with @xmath164 spatial indices . finally , we find @xmath165 the @xmath1 decay width is @xmath166 we must include not only the @xmath167 channel , but all the possible channels listed in table [ tab : geng2 ] : the @xmath168 and @xmath169 channels .",

    "therefore , @xmath172 for completeness , we show @xmath71 , @xmath173 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 again , @xmath174",

    "[ fig : diag ] and partial widths for each different loop are given in tables [ tab:1 ] , [ tab:2 ] , [ tab:3 ] , [ tab:4 ] , [ tab:5 ] and [ tab:6 ] .",

    "one can observe , however , that in the case of the @xmath185 the interference is constructive , while in the case of the @xmath186 it is destructive .",
    "we have studied the decay of the @xmath188 and @xmath189 into a photon and a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the states considered are those generated dynamically from the vector - vector interaction in @xcite that can be clearly assigned to known resonances and that decay in this mode .",

    "the results obtained for the width of the @xmath188 are well within the experimental values considering errors . for the case of the @xmath189 we found a very small width , well below the experimental upper bound of the pdg",
    ". it would be worth trying to improve on this boundary since our results are so much smaller than the present bound .",
