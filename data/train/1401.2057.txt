    "in the recent years the largely forgotten idea that momentum space may have a nontrivial geometric structure , known under the name of born reciprocity @xcite , has been revived in many different guises in the context of quantum gravity .",
    "it was noticed in @xcite that there is a one - to - one correspondence between space - time noncommutativity , expected to be one of the features of quantum gravity , and nontrivial geometric structures in momentum space .",
    "this general observation is supported by explicit calculations done in the context of gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "few years later it was realized that many nontrivial features of doubly special relativity class of theories @xcite , @xcite , @xcite can be conveniently described in terms of the geometry of de sitter momentum space @xcite .",
    "relative locality @xcite , @xcite , @xcite is a theoretical framework that has its roots in born reciprocity . in this framework",
    "the momentum space is brought to foreground .",
    "it is first observed that most , if not all , physical measurements correspond , in fact , to momentum space data .",
    "second it is noticed that the emergence of a nontrivial geometry in momentum space requires , as a prerequisite , the presence of a mass scale .",
    "such scale must be provided by a fundamental theory , and it was assumed that there exists a regime of quantum gravity , in which the length scale , the planck length , is negligibly small , while the mass scale , the planck mass , remains finite .    in the couple of years that passed since relative locality was first proposed the bulk of research investigated systems defined on flat minkowski spacetime .",
    "the question arises however if curved momentum space could coexists with a nontrivial geometry of spacetime .",
    "this possibility is particularly intriguing from the phenomenological perspectives of dsr and relative locality , since many of the opportunities that have been proposed in the recent years rely on tests of ( planck - scale ) deformation of kinematics of particles coming from cosmological distances  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the incredibly small size of such effects ( @xmath0 ) could be within the reach of present observations thanks to the huge amplification provided by the cosmological distances .",
    "in such context it is clear that the effects of spacetime curvature can not be ignored .",
    "some preliminary results on the interplay between spacetime expansion and relativity of locality have been presented in the paper  @xcite , for the case of a de sitter - like spacetime expansion .",
    "recently two of the present authors proposed the action of a particle moving in curved spacetime , whose geometry is given by the tetrad @xmath1 , with curved momentum space , provided by the tetrad @xmath2",
    "while the framework presented in  @xcite reproduces the correct action in both the complementary limits of flat spacetime / curved momentum space and curved spacetime / flat momentum space , the theory described by the action proposed in  @xcite is not manifestly invariant under general coordinate transformations ( at least in their classical form ) .",
    "this , by itself , may not be very problematic , because the scale governing the effects related to this loss of invariance would be , in this theory , presumably of order of the planck scale , and therefore they may not lead to relevant phenomenological consequences .",
    "however , from the theoretical perspective , one may find annoying the fact that the violation of the general coordinate invariance would lead to the presence of a preferred spacetime coordinate system , in which the particle action has the form proposed in  @xcite",
    ". the problem would be then to find out what this coordinate system is : is it indeed the system of cartesian coordinates in minkowski space , in the case of flat spacetime , as implicitly assumed in the construction of relative locality ? and , more importantly , how to find such system , and the form of the particle action , in the case of an arbitrary spacetime ?",
    "one possibility to avoid this conflict could be to look for a generalized class of coordinate transformations under which the action presented in  @xcite is still invariant .",
    "this would lead inevitably to coordinate transformations mixing spacetime and momentum space .",
    "taking into account that the existence of such kind of transformations is not guaranteed , it may also be conceptually compelling to explore the implications of having a theory of both spacetime and momentum space curved , in which invariance under general coordinate transformation is lost at the planck scale . while we postpone these analyses to future studies , we feel however that the option of a coordinate invariant theory is still the most desirable road to pursue in the search of generalizing relative locality to curved spacetime .",
    "thus , in this paper we present a novel formulation of the action for particles in both curved spacetime and momentum space , which is manifestly invariant under general coordinate invariance .",
    "we also show that in this theory the particles are described to move along worldlines coinciding with the standard spacetime geodesics . in the next section",
    "we show how one can construct such an action for free particles . in section 3",
    "we discuss symmetries of so defined theory . in section 4 we show how , starting from this action , one can also introduce particle interactions in the spirit of relative locality . the final section is devoted to discussion .",
    "when this work was being completed we learned about an interesting complementary results presented in @xcite .",
    "the action of a free relativistic particle with curved momentum space has the form reciprocal , in a sense , to the one of the standard free relativistic particle moving in curved spacetime , with flat momentum space .",
    "the lagrangian of the latter reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the position of the particle at time @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the particle momentum , and @xmath7 is the tetrad , characterizing the geometry of spacetime @xmath8 finally @xmath9 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the mass - shell constraint @xmath10 . to write the lagrangian  ( [ 1 ] ) we use two kind of indices : the curved spacetime index @xmath11 and the index @xmath12 related to the orthonormal coordinate system in the ambient minkowski space , to which the tetrad @xmath7 maps",
    ". it can be checked by direct calculation that the euler - lagrange equations following from ( [ 1 ] ) reduce , after solving for @xmath13 , to the standard geodesic equation .",
    "the action  ( [ 1 ] ) is the first order form of the better known second order action .",
    "the latter can be obtain from  ( [ 1 ] ) by solving the momentum equation of motion and substituting it back to  ( [ 1 ] ) ; as a result one obtains @xmath14    before we proceed , let us recall the basic properties of the tetrads .",
    "it follows from the defining equation that tetrads are spacetime vectors , transforming under diffeomorphisms as @xmath15 moreover the relations ( [ 1a ] ) are invariant under infinitesimal local lorentz transformations @xmath16 these two symmetries commute @xmath17\\ , e^a_\\mu=0 $ ] . in addition , assuming vanishing torsion , the tetrad satisfies @xmath18 } + \\omega_{[\\mu}{}^a{}_{b}\\ ,      e^b_{\\nu]}=0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a gauge field for local lorentz symmetry , transforming as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the matrix of a finite lorentz transformation @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the matrix generators of the lorentz group .",
    "finally the tetrads satisfy the tetrad postulate , according to which they are covariantly constant @xmath24    it follows from the the born reciprocity idea that the kinetic part of the relativistic particle lagrangian in the case of curved momentum space should look like ( [ 1 ] ) with the roles of @xmath25 and @xmath13 exchanged .",
    "one also has to replace the mass - shell condition with its curved momentum space counterpart @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the square of the geodesic distance between the point with coordinates @xmath28 and the origin of the momentum space , obtaining as a result @xcite , @xcite @xmath29 it should be recalled at this point that although the action ( [ 2 ] ) looks much more complex than the one of the standard relativistic particle moving in flat space , the equations of motion following from it are remarkably similar : they say that momentum @xmath30 and velocity @xmath31 are both constant .",
    "what makes the action ( [ 2 ] ) different from its standard counterpart is the relation between momentum and velocity , which becomes in the case of ( [ 2 ] ) highly nonlinear .",
    "moreover , when interactions between particles are introduced , the effects of relative locality starts being visible .",
    "generalizing these considerations , we want now to construct an action for a particle with momentum space and spacetime both possessing nontrivial geometries .",
    "of course , we want the action to reproduce the two limiting cases of flat momentum space / flat spacetime discussed above .",
    "we require moreover the new action to be still manifestly invariant under general coordinate transformations . in order to meet these requirements ,",
    "we introduce non local variables which we denote @xmath32 .",
    "we will describe their construction in the following subsection .",
    "let us denote by @xmath33 the @xmath34 curve @xmath35 for @xmath36 $ ] and consider the sub - curves @xmath37 with @xmath38 $ ] which coincide with @xmath33 up to @xmath39 .    as discussed above ,",
    "given the background spacetime metric @xmath40 , there exist a whole family of tetrads satisfying eq.([1a ] ) , which differ from one another by action of local lorentz transformations .",
    "we can now gauge fix the local lorentz transformations in such a way that the lorentz connection @xmath41 vanishes along a given curve @xmath35 and then it follows from ( [ 1d ] ) that on this curve we can construct a tetrad @xmath42 with @xmath43 such that @xmath44    the existence of the lorentz connection with these properties can be proved as follows .",
    "we first show that the component of @xmath45 along the worldline @xmath33 , @xmath46 can be gauge fixed to zero . to this end we have to solve the equation ( cf .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) ) @xmath47 .",
    "but this equation is solved by a time ordered wilson line ( holonomy ) , @xmath48 . having fixed @xmath49",
    "we are left with the gauge transformations that are constant along @xmath33 .",
    "let us now consider an arbitrary constant time surface , corresponding to some particular value of the parameter @xmath5 on @xmath33 . then in the vicinity of the point in which the worldline crosses the surface we have @xmath50 .",
    "this is sufficient freedom to gauge fix to zero the spacial components of lorentz connection @xmath51 .",
    "this can be done for any @xmath5 and therefore all the components of lorentz connection can be gauge fixed to zero along a curve .",
    "after gauge fixing @xmath52 on @xmath33 , we are left with the gauge freedom @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , once we gauge fix the connection along one curve , in general we can not do the same for another curve in its small neighborhood .",
    "the tetrads @xmath42 ( [ 3 ] ) are determined modulo a global lorentz transformation @xmath54 , which can be used to fix them equal to an arbitrary tetrad @xmath7 at one point of @xmath33 , @xmath55 since the construction of the tetrads @xmath42 reminds the one of fermi coordinates , in what follows we will call them fermi tetrads .    with these prerequisites we are ready to define the nonlocal variable @xmath32 as @xmath56",
    "the variable @xmath57 depends in general on the curve @xmath33 along which it is calculated .     and @xmath58 .",
    "]    in order to calculate the variation of the action below , we will have to evaluate the difference between variables @xmath32 calculated along different curves @xmath33 and @xmath59 lying infinitesimally close to each other , with appropriate fermi tetrads associated with each of them .",
    "thus @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes a tetrad field , defined in spacetime , which becomes a fermi tetrad on the curve @xmath33 .",
    "the variation of the tetrads @xmath42 can be decomposed into two parts : @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 in order to evaluate the expression ( [ delta1 ] ) we need to compare the fermi tetrads associated with different curves .",
    "since they are both tetrads of the same spacetime metric , there exist a local lorentz transformation @xmath21 relating them @xmath65 and the associated lorentz connections are related by the local lorentz gauge transformation @xmath66 we know that the lorentz connection @xmath67 vanishes on @xmath59 and @xmath68 vanishes on @xmath33 ; thus we have @xmath69    for an infinitesimal local lorentz gauge transformation @xmath70 , keeping the leading order terms we obtain @xmath71 from which , multiplying by @xmath72 and adding a term proportional to @xmath73 , we get @xmath74 where in the last line we used an expression for the curvature tensor that holds on @xmath33 @xmath75 equation ( [ 19 ] ) is solved by @xmath76 where we used again the fact that @xmath77 vanishes on @xmath33 and @xmath78 hence , the total variation reads @xmath79 where we used @xmath80 .",
    "notice that when @xmath81 , @xmath82 vanishes and one gets @xmath83 the total variation can be rewritten via an integration by part as @xmath84 this expression provides a linear map between the variations @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "since the basic physical variable of the particle model is the position of the worldline @xmath4 , and because the expression ( [ varfin ] ) is very complex and nonlocal , to make sure that the equations of motion following from varying @xmath87 and @xmath4 are identical , we must show that the linear mapping ( [ varfin ] ) is invertible .",
    "this is done in the appendix a. equations ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ varfin ] ) contain all the information we need to construct the action of a free particle moving in curved spacetime and momentum space , and compute the corresponding equations of motion from the variational principle .      using the non - local variable @xmath32 discussed in the preceding subsection",
    "we define the action of a particle moving in curved spacetime and momentum spaces as follows @xmath88\\ , e_a^\\alpha\\ , \\dot{p}_\\alpha\\,+n({\\cal     c}(p)\\,-\\,m^2)\\right\\}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 $ ] is calculated along the same curve @xmath33 as the integral in ( [ 9 ] ) . before turning to the discussion of the properties of this action it is worth checking if it acquires the desired form in the limiting cases of flat spacetime / momentum space , respectively .    in the case of flat spacetime , to evaluate ( [ 5 ] ) we have to find the form of the associated fermi tetrad .",
    "it follows from the tetrad postulate ( [ 1f ] ) that since both @xmath90 and @xmath91 vanish such tetrad must satisfy @xmath92 , and thus @xmath93 ( up to a global lorentz transformation . )",
    "then @xmath94 it can be checked that the second ( constant ) term produces neither a contribution to the equation of motion nor a boundary term , and thus for flat spacetime the action reproduces the one of relative locality .    in the opposite case , when the momentum space is flat , @xmath95 .",
    "we integrate ( [ 9 ] ) by parts and use ( [ 7 ] ) to obtain the standard curved spacetime particle action ( up to a boundary term ) , with the only difference being that now we have to do with the fermi tetrad instead of the generic one . however , the equations of motion are the same in both cases , so we may conclude that the actions are equivalent , the only difference being that the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under local lorentz symmetry , while in the action ( [ 9 ] ) only the global lorentz symmetry remains ) differs , up to a boundary term , from the action presented in  @xcite ( written for fermi tetrads ) by the term @xmath96 . ] .",
    "now we can turn to the equations of motion following from the action ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "its variation reads @xmath97 since we demonstrated that the map ( [ varfin ] ) is invertible , we know that the equations of motion we get from the stationarity of the action ( @xmath98 ) with respect to arbitrary variations @xmath85 are equivalent to the ones obtained by considering arbitrary variations @xmath86 . hence , we get @xmath99 which are equivalent to ( for constant @xmath9 ) @xmath100 in particular , from the second relation in ( [ 12 ] ) one finds @xmath101 where we used the expression of the christoffel symbols in terms of the tetrads @xmath42 , that follows from the tetrad postulate ( [ 1f ] ) @xmath102 therefore , the trajectory in spacetime is a geodesic , independently of the geometry in momentum space .",
    "having discussed the form of the action , let us now consider its symmetries . first of all the action is manifestly invariant under general coordinate transformations , in both momentum space ) ,",
    "the invariance under momentum space diffeomorphisms , which could be a mere formal invariance , has no classical counterpart , and we postpone its discussion to future studies . ] and spacetime , since @xmath32 is a spacetime scalar .",
    "second it is invariant under residual , global lorentz transformations that leave invariant the condition that the connection vanishes along the curve @xmath103 .",
    "from the relative locality perspective we are especially interested in translational symmetries : in the case of the model of a particle moving in flat spacetime , the main features of relativity of spacetime locality are encoded in that the fact that the translations become momentum - dependent @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "as we will see an analogous effect takes place in the case of curved spacetime .    like in the case of relative locality in flat spacetime @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "the action ( [ 9 ] ) is invariant ( up to a boundary term ) under the translation @xmath104 in flat - spacetime relative locality this symmetry translates rigidly a ( straight ) particle worldline by an amount that depends on the momentum carried by the particle .",
    "as we will see , an analogous effect takes place in curved spacetime .    to see this",
    "we must find out what is the infinitesimal shift of the particle trajectory @xmath85 corresponding to the translation ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in the effect that the transformation ( [ 30 ] ) has on trajectories , we assume that the equations of motion are satisfied .",
    "we start with ( [ varfin ] ) @xmath105 at @xmath106 we have @xmath107 this defines the first initial condition for @xmath108 .",
    "next , let us differentiate ( [ symm2 ] ) over @xmath5 @xmath109 so that at @xmath110 @xmath111_{t_1}=0\\,.\\ ] ] taking the second derivative of ( [ symm2 ] ) over @xmath5 we find @xmath112 since @xmath113 is zero by equations of motion , the second term in the above expression disappears and we are left with @xmath114 as shown in appendix b this equation can be rewritten as @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the covariant derivative projected along the worldline , subject to the initial conditions @xmath117 equation ( [ symm10 ] ) is an equation of geodesic deviation and therefore we see that the translational symmetry ( [ 30 ] ) maps the original geodesic , being the particle worldline , to another one , with the magnitude of translation depending on the momentum carried by the particle .",
    "this is exactly the effect one could foresee from the flat spacetime relative locality , where straight lines ( geodesics ) are translated by a constant , momentum dependent amount .",
    "it follows from ( [ symm11 ] ) that @xmath85 has the momentum dependence encoded by the initial condition .",
    "let us define another variable @xmath118 , which describe the momentum independent translation @xmath119 since , as shown in appendix b , both first and second covariant derivatives of the tetrad @xmath120 along the worldline vanish , we can rewrite ( [ symm10 ] ) as @xmath121 this equation describes a congruence of particle worldlines in the spacetime whose curvature is momentum - dependent .",
    "it might serve as a starting point of more phenomenologically oriented investigations .",
    "in the spirit of the relative locality framework introduced in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for an extensive discussion of the properties of these boundary terms ) , in order to describe particle processes ( at a semi - classical , non quantum , level ) , we introduce in the action  ( [ 3 ] ) boundary terms enforcing constraints on the endpoints of the particles worldlines .",
    "to illustrate how such a constraint may be introduced in our framework , suppose that we want to describe an idealized process depicted in fig .",

    "typically , @xmath131 , with the symbol @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) encoding the connection on the momentum space geometry , characterizing the ( in general non - linear ) law of summation for momenta  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the equations of motion for the bulk part eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) , the boundary term contributes with the constraints @xmath134    when @xmath129 changes , the @xmath32 transforms as @xmath135 with analogous relations holding for the other particles . assuming that we take the initial condition for the geodesic deviation equation ( [ symm11 ] ) at the interaction point",
    ", we find that @xmath136 we see therefore that the structure of the interaction vertex in the case of curved spacetime is essentially the same as in the flat spacetime case of relative locality  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we generalized relative locality , originally defined  @xcite in flat spacetime , to the case of an arbitrary , curved background spacetime , preserving invariance under general coordinate transformations .",
    "it turns out that on the formal level this latter theory is a natural generalization of the former one : free particle trajectories are now geodesics instead of flat - spacetime straight lines , and rigid , momentum dependent translations of the flat case are replaced with geodesic deviations , sensitive to curvature .    in spite of the apparent similarities",
    "there are , however , some major differences between flat and curved spacetime case . in the latter",
    "we were forced to use nonlocal variables @xmath32 to define the action that had desired symmetry properties .",
    "this might be just a technical artifact , but it may also signal a presence of some deeper layer present in theories with a nontrivial geometry in both momentum space and spacetime . furthermore , in flat spacetime the symmetries of the action are associated with some transformations ( rigid translations ) defined in the whole spacetime manifold . on the contrary , in the curved case we have to solve the equation of geodesic deviation on a given geodesic to find the symmetry .",
    "this implies that the transformation @xmath85 which leaves the action invariant ( up to a boundary term ) depends on each particular solution of equations of motion and generically , because of curvature , it can not be extended to the whole spacetime .    aside from its conceptual relevance",
    ", our result opens some interesting phenomenological perspectives .",
    "indeed most of the opportunities to test planck - scale deformation effects on particle kinematics , that have been proposed in the recent literature , rely on some source of amplification of the relevant effects due to cosmological distance of astrophysical sources .",
    "most of the results for theories with curved momentum space ( and earlier of the dsr theories ) have been discussed in the context of flat spacetime , while in the proposed scenarios relevant for planck - scale phenomenology the effect of spacetime curvature can not be neglected .",
    "our result can be taken then as starting point for further studies of relative locality effects in presence of spacetime curvature . moreover using the results of the present work one may try to investigate the relative locality effects in the case of strong gravitational field , for example in the context of black hole physics ( see @xcite ) .",
