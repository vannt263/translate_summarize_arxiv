    "in a composite but closed quantum system in which a smaller central system  s  is weakly coupled to a larger environment  c , most of the ( pure ) states of the total system for a given energy ( and possibly some additional constraints ) exhibit properties of thermal equilibrium states with respect to the smaller part  @xcite , i.e.  there exists a so - called dominant region in hilbert space in which the entropy of the central system is close to its maximum value under the given constraints .",
    "therefore for most pure initial states of the total system , the state of the central system shows decoherence and some kind of thermalization ; it typically approaches a quasi - equilibrium canonical state with a temperature given by the spectral properties of the environment  @xcite .",
