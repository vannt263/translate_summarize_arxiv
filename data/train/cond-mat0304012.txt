    "recently ( see @xcite and references therein ) , great advances have been made in the problem of ferromagnetism ( fmm ) of p - doped diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "the question about influence of different physical phenomena in dms on the critical temperature @xmath1 of ferromagnetic ( fm ) phase transition is of prime interest for searching for the future study trends .",
    "after pashitskii and ryabchenko prediction of fmm in dms,@xcite the competition between fm correlations mediated by indirect long - range spin - spin interaction and direct short - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interaction is considered to be decisive in the formation of fm state in dms . in other words , to obtain fm state with high enough @xmath1 , we need to inhibit the afm contribution .",
    "due to short - range character of afm interaction , only close pairs of magnetic ions contribute to it .",
    "this contribution can be minimized by decreasing the magnetic ion concentration @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath3 is too small , ferromagnetism can be destroyed . to retain fm ordering in this case",
    ", we may increase the carriers concentration @xmath4 ( in p - type dms this corresponds to holes concentration @xmath5 ) .",
    "the calculations of @xmath6 performed in a mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite support this standpoint predicting an increase of @xmath0 as @xmath7 .",
    "however , at large @xmath4 , the friedel oscillations of carrier spin polarization become significant so that mfa becomes inapplicable .",
    "more thorough calculations with respect to friedel oscillations ( i.e. beyond mfa ) corroborate above statement and show that in dms undergoing fm phase transition @xmath4 can not exceed some critical value related to @xmath2 . the reason for that is the oscillations of the rkky interaction at the scale of @xmath8 , which makes impossible long - range fm correlations if @xmath9 , ( @xmath10 is an inter - ion mean distance ) @xcite .    to properly account for above friedel oscillations , which is indeed a spatial dispersion of inter - ion interaction , we developed so - called random field approximation ( rfa ) in ref .. in that work , the ion - ion interaction has been considered in the context of ising model .",
    "this model can be applied for axially symmetric semiconductors with magnetic ions interacting indirectly via holes ( i.e. with rkky interaction ) .",
    "the reason for ising model usage for rkky interaction is a complex structure of valence band in dms that picks out the hole angular momenta projections @xmath11 for lowest heavy hole subbands in crystals with distorted cubic or uniaxial lattice .    additionally to spatial dispersion of inter - ion interaction ,",
    "there are fluctuations of local magnetic field direction that also can not be described in terms of mfa .",
    "this effect stems from the contribution of transversal spin components in effective heisenberg - like hamiltonian of spin - spin interaction .",
    "namely , rkky - interaction in p - doped undistorted dms with cubic lattice represents this situation .    in the present paper",
    "we pay attention to the fact , that transition from heisenberg spin - spin interaction to ising one , i.e. exclusion of transversal spin components from heisenberg hamiltonian decreases the system entropy and therefore can enhance @xmath0 .",
    "for quantitative description of this effect we present a comparative analysis of the rfa - theories for critical temperature @xmath12 in heisenberg and ising models .",
    "this analysis has been made to determine the role of directional fluctuations ( inherent to heisenberg model ) of localized spins in a random magnetic field .",
    "the uniaxial stresses in typical dms - structures grown on a substrate with some mismatch of lattice constants is shown to be the factor responsible for appearance of ising - like interaction between magnetic ions spins .",
    "thus , we predict a new effect implying that increasing of @xmath0 can be controlled within certain bounds by the uniaxial stresses in dms . in other words",
    ", we expect that strain engineering can efficiently control the value of ferromagnetic phase transition temperature resulting from the hole - mediated exchange interaction between magnetic ions in dms .",
    "the hamiltonian of heisenberg model for dms reads @xmath13where external magnetic field @xmath14 and interaction @xmath15 is measured in energy units ( i.e. @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "the transition to ising model means , hereafter , keeping only @xmath18 - components in scalar product @xmath19 .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ mu0 ] ) incorporates two kinds of randomness .",
    "first , ( the spatial disorder ) is that spin can be randomly present or absent in the specific @xmath20-th cite of a host semiconductor .",
    "second , ( the thermal disorder ) is a random quantum state of a spin in @xmath20-th cite .",
    "these spatial and thermal fluctuations can be taken into consideration by introduction of random field rather than mean field .    in the random field approximation",
    ", we consider every spin @xmath21 as a source of fluctuating ( random ) field @xmath22affecting other spin at the sites @xmath23 .",
    "in other words , every spin is subjected to some random ( rather then mean ) field , created by all other spins .",
    "so , all thermodynamic properties of the system will be determined by the distribution function @xmath24 of the random field @xmath25 .",
    "namely , any spin dependent macroscopic quantity ( like magnetization ) @xmath26 reads @xmath27 where @xmath28is a single particle thermal average with temperature @xmath29 and effective zeeman hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "the distribution function @xmath31 is defined as    @xmath32    where the bar means averaging over spatial disorder .",
    "our rfa approach is based on micro - canonical statistical theory of magnetic resonance line shape.@xcite latter theory assumes the additivity of local molecular field contributions @xmath33 @xmath34 of each particle @xmath20 ( eq .

    "simplest situation corresponds to the case @xmath43 , where only magnetization @xmath44 ( or in dimensionless units @xmath45 ; @xmath46 is g - factor of a magnetic ion ) is a unique order parameter to be found .",

    "it should be noted here that contrary to conventional phenomenological landau expansions of a free energy , the coefficients @xmath68 in the function ( [ q1 ] ) have been derived microscopically within our rfa approach .",
    "free energy functions ( [ fenh ] ) and ( [ q1 ] ) give a possibility to describe the experimentally observable equilibrium thermodynamic characteristics ( like magnetic susceptibility , specific heat etc ) of the dms both in paramagnetic and in ferromagnetic phases .    according to landau theory of phase transitions ,",

    "this study , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .    the limit @xmath75 in ( [ eq27a ] ) gives the relation between parameters of the system , which determines the condition for ferromagnetic ordering to occur in dms at @xmath76 .",

    "the difference between them consists only in the form of kernels of integrals for heisenberg ( eq .",

    "next terms of expansion of the eqs ( [ eq6a ] ) , ( [ eq7a ] ) correspond to gaussian asymptotics for distribution function of local fields .",
    "the purpose of subsequent analysis is to compare the ( actual , i.e. non gaussian ) fluctuations of longitudinal components of random field with those of transversal ones .",
    "since our theory permits to find the distribution function @xmath103 when a spatial dependence of @xmath104 is assigned , we should specify a magnetic interaction in the system . usually in the problems of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in dms ,",
    "the rkky interaction@xcite is considered as an effective spin - spin exchange interaction resulting in fm ordering . to clarify the role of transversal spin fluctuations , here we use the simplest possible form of the interaction and neglect all possible factors that can influence @xmath105 ( such as nonparabolicity of carrier dispersion law etc , see refs for more details ) .",
    "also , the stresses may change the form of @xmath106 see below for discussion .    in the case of simple one band carrier structure ,",

    "the threshold temperature of ferromagnetic ordering in mfa now can be found by evaluation of integrals ( [ tcmf ] ) with respect to ( [ rkk ] ) : @xmath116here , the factor @xmath117 is independent of carrier concentration , @xmath118 is a molar fraction of the magnetic ions .",

    "the equations for critical temperatures for both above models assume following form @xmath130where @xmath131 ; @xmath132 stands for @xmath84 ( heisenberg model ) or @xmath133 ( ising model ) .",
    "the result of calculation of @xmath134 with the help of eq .",
    "( [ s19 ] ) as a function of @xmath135 is reported in the fig.1a .",

    "our results also show the critical character of dependence @xmath139 that can be well approximated by the function @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 for heisenberg and ising models respectively .",
    "thus , the fluctuations of transversal spin components suppress a tendency towards fm ordering in the range of concentration ratios @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , in the range @xmath144 , our results predict impossibility of fmm in dms with heisenberg - like spin - spin interaction while in this interval of @xmath135 fmm can still occur in dms with ising- like interaction between spins .",
    "since ising model is inherent to uniaxially stressed semiconductors , latter conclusion means that uniaxial distortion can effectively inhibit transversal spin fluctuations thus enhancing @xmath0 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq27a ] ) for critical temperature @xmath0 is exact in the framework of our model , which means that it incorporates non - gaussian fluctuations .",

    "appendix c presents the final result of such calculations for @xmath150 and @xmath145 ( eq.([eq5r ] ) ) .",
    "it is apparent from appendix c that the case @xmath145 involves much more order parameters ( such as @xmath151 , @xmath152 ; @xmath153 , and @xmath154 , @xmath155 ; @xmath153 ) than in the case @xmath43 .",
    "not all of them play a crucial role in a formation of fm phase in dms .",
    "for example , if the random field fluctuations are almost gaussian , we can find the expectation values of spin operators ( [ mu2 ] ) with the aid of only two parameters , representing first and second moments of the distribution function @xmath103 .",
    "our calculations show that gaussian approximation for @xmath103 adequately describes the actual phase diagram of dms ( except for close vicinity of critical concentration which is not practically important ) .",
    "that is why the analysis of the case of @xmath145 can be performed with sufficient accuracy in gaussian approximation . to do this , the eq .",

    "the magnetization and mean value of random field @xmath158 are negligibly small at this temperature that suggests that @xmath159 is isotropic .",

    "but there is also a difference .",
    "comparison of fig.1a and 1b shows that the area between curves @xmath192 for heisenberg ( h ) and ising ( i ) models at low temperatures is smaller for @xmath193 .",
    "this means that for @xmath145 quantum fluctuations ( which is the only possible fluctuations at @xmath76 ) are inhibited as compared to the case @xmath43 .",
    "this is actually a reflection of the well known fact that the larger the magnitude of the quantum number of the spin , the `` more classical '' it is , i.e. the smaller is the contribution of quantum fluctuations of its transversal components . at @xmath194 additional thermal fluctuations",
    "it is seen from the figure , that at @xmath195 the extension of fm phase due to enhancement of @xmath0 is almost the same for @xmath196 and @xmath43 .",
    "this means that the thermal fluctuations of the spin do not sensitive to its value .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a new mechanism of the enhancement of fm phase transition temperature @xmath1 by the uniaxial distortion of dms .",
    "this prediction is based on comparative analysis of heisenberg ( inherent to undistorted dms ) and ising ( inherent to uniaxially distorted dms ) models .",
    "the analysis of above models has been carried out in the framework of our recently developed formalism , @xcite random field method .",
    "this method , which can be regarded as a substitution of conventional mfa for disordered systems with given @xmath105 , permits to derive self - consistently the equations for order parameter @xmath64 and the free energy functions of dms .",
    "now we discuss in more details the influence of stresses on magnetic spin hamiltonian of dms ( [ mu0 ] ) .",
    "we consider such influence in two steps . in first step",
    "we consider the influence of the stress on the effective spin - spin interaction potential and in second step we consider the operator part of the hamiltonian .",
    "since the effective potential of indirect spin - spin interaction strongly depends on the band structure of specific semiconductor sample , which is affected by the stress , this potential by itself may also depend on stress .",
    "this influence @xcite is manifested via both density of states ( in our case we use the effective mass of density of states @xmath113 ( [ rkk ] ) ) at the fermi level and concentration of free holes , related to pinning of the fermi level by defects and impurities of different nature . as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of pressure on the density of states is small .",
    "the influence via pinning centers depends entirely on their nature .",
    "we can imagine the situation when the influence of pressure on the concentration is also small .",
    "for example , in the cases of the absence ( or small number ) of pinning centers or `` synchronous movement '' of pinning centers with the valence band edge shift due to deformation potential , this effect is negligible and our mechanism of influence of the pressure will be decisive .",
    "here we would like to emphasize that there are no general problems to incorporate the possible dependence of the concentration on the stress into our consideration ( this is simply one more modification of @xmath15 in ( [ mu0 ] ) ) .",
    "if we do so , the considered effect of elimination of transversal spin components by the stress , which has not been discussed in the literature , is an additional factor enhancing @xmath197    to discuss the stress effect on the operator part , we note that in the typical case of p - type dms with cubic lattice the transversal spin - spin interaction can be substantially inhibited by the uniaxial stress of a crystal",
    ". really , such stress splits the valence band edge to light and heavy hole subbands .",
    "the resulting heavy hole ( hh ) states are characterized by angular momentum projection @xmath11 . for such states ,",
    "the spin - flip scattering of these holes on magnetic ions is forbidden due to angular momentum conservation .",
    "hence only longitudinal ( along the distortion axis ) @xmath198-components of the spins will be present in the resulting indirect spin - spin interaction via above heavy holes .    however , aforementioned spin - flip processes are not forbidden both for light hole ( lh ) states ( with spin projection @xmath199 ) and for transitions between lh and hh states thus contributing to the indirect interaction of transversal spin components of magnetic ions .",

    "the ratio @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) should be monotonically decreasing function of the ratio of heavy holes concentration @xmath203 to their complete concentration @xmath204 . thus ,",
    "if deformational hh - lh splitting exceeds the fermi energy of the holes , the ratio @xmath205 reaches its maximal value ( @xmath206 ) , corresponding to ising hamiltonian ( @xmath207 ) of the indirect spin - spin interaction . in this case the region of ferromagnetic state of dms expands substantially towards both higher carriers ( holes ) concentration and higher temperatures .    the detailed theoretical description of all above effects , which is intimately related to the parameters of specific dms sample and experimental conditions , can be developed within the framework of presented theory for any particular case .",
    "however , such calculations can be done only numerically .",
    "note , that the magnitude of effect which we predicted is very sensitive to the holes concentration @xmath208 .",
    "the problem of its correct determination , to the best of our knowledge , is related to the influence of anomalous hall effect .",
    "latter effect lowers reliability of @xmath208 determination from hall effect data @xcite .    for better illustration of our effect",
    ", we estimate now the magnitude of @xmath209 increase for typical ferromagnetic dms @xmath210 deposited on @xmath211 and @xmath212 substrates . the mismatch @xmath213 of lattice constant @xmath214 leads to biaxial strain that splits the valence band with deformation potential @xmath215 ev by the value @xmath216,@xcite where @xmath217- component of strain tensor @xmath218 , and the ratio of elastic moduli in gaas @xmath219 . for @xmath220 ( or concentration @xmath221 @xmath222 ) , the relative mismatch @xmath223 for @xmath211 substrate and @xmath224 for @xmath212 substrate.@xcite we can see that for @xmath211 substrate small valence band splitting @xmath225 mev can not suppress interaction of transversal @xmath226-spin components for typical concentration @xmath227 @xmath222 which corresponds to fermi energy @xmath228 mev , whereas for @xmath229 substrate @xmath230 mev @xmath231 .",
    "thus , our mechanism predicts the enhancement of @xmath1 for @xmath210 on @xmath212 substrate by the factor 1.64 ( see fig.1b for @xmath232 ) as compared to the same dms but on @xmath211 substrate .",
    "let us finally note that in the present paper we considered the enhancement of @xmath0 due to rkky interaction only .",
    "but there are also other mechanisms , which can lead to appearance of ferromagnetism in dms , see @xcite for details .",
    "these mechanisms will be eventually reduced to the hamiltonian ( mu0 ) with modified potential @xmath233 .",
