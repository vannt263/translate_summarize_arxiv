    "the most natural way of defining the entropy of a quantum system is to use the von neumann entropy : @xmath0\\ , , \\label{entropy : vn}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the density operator which in the schrdinger picture satisfies the von neumann equation : @xmath2 \\ , , \\label{density op : eom}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian .",
    "since quantum mechanics and quantum field theory are unitary theories , the von neumann entropy is conserved , albeit in general not zero .",
    "the decoherence program  @xcite usually assumes the existence of some environment that is barely observable to some observer .",
    "this allows us to construct a reduced density operator @xmath4 characterising the system s , which is obtained by tracing over the unobservable environmental degrees of freedom e : @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this is a non - unitary process which consequently generates entropy .",
    "this operation is justified by the observer s inability to see the environmental degrees of freedom ( or better : access the information stored in the es - correlators ) . yet , tracing out some degrees of freedom results in complications .",
    "the simple looking von neumann equation  ( [ density op : eom ] ) is replaced by an equation for the reduced density operator .",
    "this `` master equation ''  @xcite can be solved for only in very simple situations , which has hampered progress in decoherence studies in the context of interacting quantum field theories . in particular , we are not aware of any known solution of the master equation that would include perturbative corrections and implement the program of renormalisation . also , one has no control of the error in a calculation in the perturbative sense induced by neglecting non - gaussian corrections .",
    "here we propose a decoherence program that can be implemented in a field theoretical setting and that also allows us to incorporate renormalisation procedures .",
    "the idea is very simple , and we present it for a real scalar field @xmath6 . a generalisation to other types of fields , e.g. gauge and fermionic fields , should be quite straightforward .",
    "the density matrix @xmath7 contains all information about the ( possibly mixed ) state a quantum system is in . from the density matrix",
    "one can , in principle , calculate various correlators .",
    "for example , the three gaussian correlators are given by :    [ 3 equal time correlators ] @xmath8 = f(\\vec{x},t;\\vec{y},t')|_{t = t'}\\label{3 equal time correlatorsa } \\\\",
    "\\langle \\hat{\\pi}(\\vec{x } ) \\hat{\\pi}(\\vec{y } ) \\rangle & = & { \\rm tr}[\\hat \\rho(t ) \\hat\\pi(\\vec x)\\hat\\pi(\\vec y ) ] = \\partial_{t } \\partial_{t ' } f(\\vec{x},t;\\vec{y},t')|_{t = t ' } \\label{3 equal time correlatorsb } \\\\ \\frac{1}{2 } \\langle \\ { \\hat{\\phi}(\\vec{x } ) , \\hat{\\pi}(\\vec{y } ) \\ }",

    "note that these three gaussian correlators can all be determined from the statistical propagator @xmath11 in the heisenberg picture as usual in quantum field theory .",
    "the fourth gaussian correlator is trivial as it is restricted by the canonical commutation relations .",
    "there is an infinite number of higher order , non - gaussian correlators that characterise a system , where one can think of e.g. :    [ ngcorrelators ] @xmath12 \\label{ngcorrelatorsa } \\\\ \\langle \\hat{\\pi}(\\vec{x}_{1 } ) \\cdots \\hat{\\pi}(\\vec{x}_{n } ) \\rangle & = & { \\rm tr}[\\hat \\rho(t ) \\hat\\pi(\\vec{x}_{1 } ) \\cdots \\hat\\pi(\\vec{x}_{n } ) ] \\label{ngcorrelatorsb } \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , one can also imagine a higher order correlation function consisting of a mixture of both @xmath14 s and @xmath15 s .",
    "finally , one could think of other non - gaussian correlators obtained by further differentiating the statistical propagator : @xmath16 |_{t = t'}\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 .",
    "for free theories , all the non - gaussian correlators either vanish or can be expressed in terms of the gaussian correlators .",
    "let us turn our attention to interacting field theories and present two simple arguments why , generally speaking , the gaussian correlators dominate over the non - gaussian correlators .",
    "in interacting quantum field theories , the gaussian correlators all stem from tree - level physics , whereas non - gaussian correlators are generated by the interactions . relying on a perturbative treatment of these interactions",
    ", we can safely expect that all of these higher order , non - gaussian correlators above are suppressed as they generically are proportional to a non - zero power of the ( perturbatively small ) interaction coefficient .",
    "a second , more heuristic , argument invokes the ( classical ) central limit theorem , according to which systems with many stochastic mutually independent degrees of freedom tend to become normally distributed , and hence nearly gaussian .",
    "while this theorem is derived for classical systems and for independent stochastic variables , we believe that it will in a certain quantum disguise also apply to weakly interacting quantum systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , we expect that to a good approximation , many of the relevant properties of quantum systems are encoded in the gaussian part @xmath18 of the density operator @xmath19 and the non - gaussian correlators are thus typically much more difficult to access\\sim g_nh^2\\sim 10^{-12}$ ] , where @xmath20 denotes the newtonian potential , where @xmath21 is newton s constant and @xmath22 is the hubble rate during inflation , its quantum corrections are expected to be of the order @xmath23 or smaller . ] .",
    "the crucial point is that all information about a general gaussian density matrix and thus about the gaussian part of a state , is stored only in the three equal time correlators ( [ 3 equal time correlators ] ) .",
    "all non - gaussian correlators like ( [ ngcorrelators ] ) contain information about the correlations between the system and environment as well as the environment s correlations induced by higher order interactions . when projected on the field amplitude basis in the schrdinger picture , the gaussian part of a density matrix reads : @xmath24 \\equiv \\langle \\phi| \\hat \\rho_{\\mathrm{g}}(t ) |\\phi'\\rangle = { \\cal n}\\exp \\ ! \\left[\\ ! - \\ ! \\int \\ !",
    "\\mathrm{d}^3x \\mathrm{d}^3y\\left ( \\phi(\\vec x\\ , ) a(\\vec x,\\vec y;t)\\phi(\\vec y\\ , ) + \\phi'(\\vec x\\ , ) b(\\vec x,\\vec y;t)\\phi'(\\vec y\\,)-2\\phi(\\vec x\\ , ) c(\\vec x,\\vec y;t)\\phi'(\\vec y\\,)\\right ) \\right]\\ ! , \\label{density matrix : gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are functions of the equal time field correlators ( for details see sections  [ entropy in scalar field theory ] ) .",
    "of course , the von neumann equation  ( [ density op : eom ] ) does not hold any more for @xmath27 , and thus the entropy conservation law is violated by @xmath27 . indeed , neglecting the information stored in observationally inaccessible correlators will give rise to an increase of the entropy .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to calculate the entropy of a system taking these considerations into account .",
    "we distinguish two cases . in the simplest case",
    "we assume that our observer can only measure gaussian correlators and his apparatus is insensitive to all non - gaussian correlators .",
    "we will consider this situation in sections [ gaussian entropy from the wigner function ] and [ gaussian entropy from the replica trick ] .",
    "in quantum field theories , the problem seems to be that the evolution equations of the three gaussian correlators  ( [ 3 equal time correlators ] ) do not close as soon as perturbative corrections are included .",
    "the reason is that off - shell physics becomes important . a way out of this impasse , and in our opinion _",
    "the _ way out , is to solve for the dynamics of the unequal time statistical correlator , i.e. the statistical propagator , from which one then extracts the three relevant correlators  ( [ 3 equal time correlators ] ) .    in the second case",
    ", we assume that our observer is sensitive to specific types of non - gaussianities present in our theory , apart from the leading order gaussian correlators of course , either because the observer has developed a sensitive measurement device or the non - gaussianities happen to be large enough .",
    "we will consider this case in section [ non - gaussian entropy : two examples ] .",
    "the sections above contain , for pedagogical reasons , quantum mechanical derivations rather than quantum field theoretical calculations .",
    "we will generalise our results to quantum field theory in section [ entropy in scalar field theory ] .",
    "this paper aims only at developing the necessary machinery to discuss entropy generation in an interacting quantum field theory in an out - of - equilibrium setting , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we discuss the application of these ideas elsewhere @xcite in great detail , where we consider a scalar field @xmath28 coupled to a second scalar field via the interaction lagrangian density @xmath29 .",
    "the results we develop here are applicable to a much more wider class of field theoretical models , including gauge and fermionic fields .",
    "entropy has of course been widely studied over the years @xcite . in this section",
    "we will derive an entropy formula based on a nave probabilistic interpretation of the wigner function .",
    "this characterises much of the 20th century efforts to connect the wigner function , boltzmann s equations , boltzmann s h - theorem and macroscopic entropy @xcite .",
    "let us begin by considering the hamiltonian of a time dependent harmonic oscillator , which is the one - particle `` free '' hamiltonian : @xmath30 in general , the oscillator s mass and frequency and the source current can all depend on time : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is the source hamiltonian and @xmath33 the corresponding current .",
    "this hamiltonian is relevant both for many condensed matter systems that can be realised in laboratories and in an early universe setting . for the latter ,",
    "the time dependence of the parameters is introduced for example by the universe s expansion or by phase transitions .",
    "alternatively , this hamiltonian can represent for example the simplest model of a laser , where @xmath35 is the photon amplitude , where , if @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the photon s frequency and where @xmath33 is a charge current that coherently pumps energy into the system , transforming the vacuum state into a coherent state @xcite .",
    "the time dependence of the parameters changes the system s energy , but simultaneously does not change the gaussian nature of a state if such a state is imposed initially , i.e. : the evolution implied by the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian:1particle ] ) transforms an initial gaussian density matrix into another gaussian density matrix .",
    "moreover , as we will come to appreciate , one has to add a coupling to the environment or add a self - interaction to generate entropy .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath38 follows as usual from the hamiltonian .",
    "note that the source term can be removed from this lagrangian by a simple coordinate shift : @xmath39 upon which the lagrangian reduces to a quadratic form : @xmath40\\,.\\ ] ] here , @xmath41 is a @xmath42-independent function of time and the last term is a boundary term which does not contribute to the equation of motion if @xmath43 is a function that obeys : @xmath44+m\\omega^{2 } x_{0 } + j = 0 \\,.\\ ] ] a general gaussian density matrix centered at the new origin remains a gaussian density matrix centered at the origin under the evolution of a quadratic hamiltonian and moreover , which is what the analysis above shows , linear source terms in the hamiltonian will not alter the gaussian nature of the state .",
    "we can thus consider gaussian density matrices centered at the origin , whose time evolution is governed by an hamiltonian of the form  ( [ hamiltonian:1particle ] ) with @xmath45 .",
    "when written in position space representation , the single particle density operator of a quantum mechanical gaussian state centered at the origin is of the form :    [ density operator : particle ] @xmath46 where : @xmath47 \\,,\\ ] ]    and where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are determined from the von neumann equation  ( [ density op : eom ] ) .",
    "the subscript g denotes `` gaussian '' .",
    "moreover , from @xmath51 it follows that @xmath52 and @xmath53 . when @xmath54 one recovers a pure state with vanishing entropy .",
    "however when @xmath55 the density matrix is mixed and entangled and it can not be written in the simple diagonal form , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 . when @xmath58 the density matrix tends to get diagonal in the @xmath59 direction , however when @xmath60 the diagonalisation occurs in the @xmath61 direction in which case the entropy is not defined . the heisenberg uncertainty relation is in trouble in this case as we will see in equation ( [ uncertainly relation ] ) .",
    "hence it is natural to assume that @xmath58 .",
    "we keep the discussion phenomenological and do not discuss the physical origin of @xmath55 .",

    "note that @xmath73 is consistent with equation  ( [ density matrix : eom:2c ] ) as it should ) one can show that equations  ( [ density matrix : eom:2 ] ) are consistent with ( and equivalent to ) the hamilton equations for the correlators  ( [ hamilton equations : correlators ] ) . ] .",
    "the wigner function is defined as a wigner transform of the density matrix @xmath74 : @xmath75 where we defined the average and relative coordinates , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "hence , a wigner transform can be thought of as an ordinary fourier transform with respect to the relative coordinate @xmath78 of the density matrix .",
    "the inverse wigner transform determines @xmath74 in terms of @xmath79 : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the standard phase space measure .",
    "we obtain the gaussian wigner function by performing the integral  ( [ wigner function : def ] ) : @xmath82 \\,,\\ ] ] where :    [ wigner function : gauss2 ] @xmath83    and @xmath84 denotes a `` classical '' momentum , which makes the wigner function non - diagonal .",
    "note that the wigner function  ( [ wigner function : gauss ] ) is normalised to unity , in the sense that : @xmath85 recalling definition  ( [ wigner function : def ] ) , equation ( [ density matrix : eom ] ) transforms to : @xmath86 where we made use of the following relations :    [ intermediatestep1 ] @xmath87    upon noting that @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we see that equation  ( [ wigner function : eom ] ) is nothing but the liouville equation for the boltzmann s distribution function @xmath90 , @xmath91 a probabilistic interpretation of the wigner function thus seems plausible by the following identification : @xmath92 of course , the equations for @xmath93 and @xmath90 are identical only in a free harmonic oscillator theory and , when interactions are included , differences arise between the von neumann equation for the density operator @xmath94 ( or the corresponding equation for @xmath79 ) and the boltzmann equation for @xmath90 . this indeed makes the identification  ( [ w = f ] ) less rigorous but it remains a useful picture .",
    "the correspondence ( [ w = f ] ) has been widely used in the literature to develop a formalism relevant for example for the physics of heavy ion collisions @xcite or for baryogenesis @xcite .    in the distant 1969 cahill and glauber  @xcite",
    "have proposed to approximate the density operator in the coherent state basis @xmath95 by its diagonal form : @xmath96 , which they interpret as a quasi - probability distribution . since coherent states harbour many properties of classical particles",
    ", one can argue that this is reasonable . recall that coherent states are defined by @xmath97 , where @xmath98 $ ] denotes the annihilation operator for the oscillator  ( [ hamiltonian:1particle ] ) .",
    "the density matrix @xmath99 represents an early example of a quasi - probability distribution for a quantum system .",
    "needless to say , by this line of reasoning one can get only approximate answers for the expectation value @xmath100 $ ] of an operator @xmath101 and likewise for the entropy ( which is just the expectation value of @xmath102 ) .",
    "another common way of approximating expectation values of operators is to give a probabilistic interpretation to the wigner function , along the same line of reasoning as argued above in equation  ( [ w = f ] ) for a free theory . in this approach  @xcite the entropy is approximated by : @xmath103 \\ , , \\label{entropy : wigner}\\ ] ] where the trace @xmath104 $ ] should be interpreted as an integration over the phase space volume as in equation  ( [ trw=1 ] ) .",
    "we now insert  ( [ wigner function : gauss ] ) into  ( [ entropy : wigner ] ) to find : @xmath105 where we defined : @xmath106 we evaluated the phase space gaussian integrals by shifting the momentum integration to @xmath107 ( the jacobian of this shift equals unity ) . at this point",
    ", it is useful to evaluate a few quantum mechanical expectation values .",

    "this enables us to find the equivalent inverse relations :    [ ai : ar : c ] @xmath111    and to express @xmath112 in equation ( [ delta function:2 ] ) in terms of the correlators  ( [ correlators : all ] ) : @xmath113 \\ , .",
    "\\label{delta function:3}\\ ] ] for the moment this is just a definition , but as we will come to discuss , the physical meaning of @xmath114 is the phase space area in units of @xmath115 occupied by a ( gaussian ) state centered at the origin . for a pure state @xmath116 , while for a mixed state @xmath117 .",
    "hence , we can define the uncertainty relation for a general gaussian state : @xmath118 if @xmath119 is negative and @xmath120 , we can in principle have @xmath121 , which can be seen from equation ( [ delta function:2 ] )",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate whether any physical experiment could be proposed where a violation of heisenberg s uncertainty relation occurs , even if it were for only a very brief moment in time ( such that it would still hold on average ) .",
    "furthermore , it is natural to define the statistical particle number density on our phase space , in the quantum field theoretical sense , as : @xmath122 in terms of which the wigner entropy  ( [ wigner function : entropy : final ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath123 these results in essence agree with the entropy per mode of scalar cosmological perturbations obtained in @xcite .",
    "shortly we shall see that the wigner entropy  ( [ wigner function : entropy:2 ] ) is a good approximation for the von neumann entropy if @xmath124 , or equivalently when @xmath125 .",
    "let us try to put these results briefly in historical context .",
    "the fundamental question that is left unanswered in  @xcite is what the dynamical mechanism for the growth of @xmath126 is . instead",
    ", the authors argue that an observer that measures cosmological perturbations can be approximated by a coherent state ( which is a good classical basis ) , thus explaining the growth in @xmath126 .",
    "two mechanisms were considered in @xcite : a projection on the particle number basis and on the coherent state basis . in both cases , information of the phase of the squeezed gaussian state",
    "is lost , which thus generates entropy . in the latter approach formula  ( [ delta function:3 ] )",
    "is reproduced , while in the former , the entropy acquires the form of the statistical entropy of bose particles @xmath127 with @xmath128 the particle number associated with the squeezed state , and @xmath78 the squeezing parameter of the state . while these early articles , and many subsequent ones  @xcite , attempted to explain the origin of entropy of cosmological perturbations by a ( non - unitary ) process of coarse graining ( associated with particular properties of the observer s measuring apparatus ) , a genuine dynamical mechanism of entropy generation was lacking .",
    "this has changed recently @xcite , now dynamical mechanisms for entropy generation have been proposed . rather than discussing various mechanisms in detail ,",
    "let us just point out that the notion of how entropy should be defined and generated has evolved : recently , it has been advocated that the relevant entropy to consider is the gaussian entropy , although the approaches differ in the actual origin of the entropy increase . for example ,",

    "kiefer , lohmar , polarski and starobinsky  @xcite as well as campo and parentani  @xcite , among others , suggested that , if super - hubble modes take the role of the system , the origin of the entropy of cosmological perturbations should be associated with the stochastic noise generated by the sub - hubble ultraviolet modes representing the environment . both giraud and serrau @xcite and we @xcite advocate that neglecting observationally inaccessible non - gaussianities is a prominent mechanism to generate entropy .    .",

    "[ fig : gaussianphasespace2 ] ]    _ _    so far , we have discussed how the gaussian entropy in wigner space is defined and qualitatively discussed various mechanisms to generate entropy dynamically .",
    "let us now , to finish this section , discuss how one can sensibly think of a decohered state in wigner space and discuss the physical meaning of @xmath112 .",
    "despite the fact that the wigner entropy ( [ wigner function : entropy : final ] ) only approximates the von neumann entropy , it offers a useful , intuitive way of depicting decohered states irrespective of the precise underlying mechanism by which such a state has decohered in the first place .",
    "let us , for this reason , discuss this phenomenologically .",
    "the wigner function ( [ wigner function : gauss ] ) is a 2-dimensional gaussian function whose width in the @xmath129-direction need a priori not necessarily be the same as in the @xmath130-direction .",
    "hence , in general it can be squeezed in some direction .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : gaussianphasespace3 ] .",
    "the @xmath131 or @xmath132 cross - section of the phase space distribution has the shape of an ellipse , which we also visualised in figure [ fig : gaussianphasespace3 ] .",
    "if the cross - section is a circle centered at the origin , the state is either pure or mixed and if , moreover , its area is unity @xmath133 it is a pure vacuum state .",
    "if the cross - section is again a circle but displaced from the origin , we are dealing with a generalised coherent - squeezed state ( whose shape is not described by equation ( [ wigner function : entropy : final ] ) for obvious reasons ) . if the cross - section is an ellipse , it is a squeezed state as mentioned before .",
    "the ellipse is parametrised by : @xmath134 where we have made use of equation ( [ wigner function : gauss ] ) and where @xmath135 is some constant that determines the height at which we slice the wigner function .",
    "the area of this ellipse is now given by is @xmath136 . ] : @xmath137 where we have used equations ( [ wigner function : gauss2 ] ) and ( [ delta function:2 ] ) .",
    "clearly , the area of the ellipse in wigner space is determined straightforwardly from the phase space area @xmath112 .",
    "note that if @xmath138 we have @xmath139 .",
    "figures [ fig : gaussianphasespace1 ] and [ fig : gaussianphasespace2 ] visualise the decoherence process of a squeezed state .",
    "initially , in figure [ fig : gaussianphasespace1 ] , the state is squeezed and has unity phase space area @xmath140 , such that its entropy vanishes . now we switch on our favourite decoherence mechanism : the state interacts with some environment and environmental degrees of freedom are traced over or non - gaussian correlators generated by the interaction with the environment are neglected .",
    "consequently , the area in phase space increases @xmath117 , such that @xmath141 .",
    "hence , the ellipse in wigner space grows which we depict in figure [ fig : gaussianphasespace2 ] .",
    "an important feature of any decoherence process reveals itself : for a highly squeezed state , given the knowledge of @xmath130 after some measurement , the value @xmath129 can take in a subsequent measurement is constraint in a very narrow interval .",
    "interestingly , after the state has decohered , and given the same measurement of @xmath130 , the range of values @xmath129 can take has increased .",
    "indeed one can say that knowledge about @xmath129 has been lost compared to the squeezed state before decoherence , hence entropy has been generated .",
    "alternatively , we can say that given some measurement of @xmath130 , the value @xmath129 can take is , after decoherence , drawn from a classical stochastic distribution , which indeed coincides with the familiar idea that decohered quantum systems should behave as uncorrelated stochastic systems .",
    "indeed , @xmath142 roughly counts the number of patches in phase space that behave independently and are uncorrelated .    with this intuitive notion of decohered state in mind , one can understand that , for highly squeezed states , the position space basis ( which generalises to the field amplitude basis in the quantum field theoretical case ) is the pointer basis .",
    "let us start out with a highly squeezed state , i.e. : take for example a pure state during inflation that rapidly squeezes during the universe s expansion .",
    "the hamiltonian of the state is then dominated by the potential term , and the kinetic term only contributes little . in thermal equilibrium , the system will minimise its free energy @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the temperature of the heat bath .",
    "now , if we switch on some decoherence mechanism due to interaction with the environment , the entropy will increase mainly due to momentum increase , i.e. : @xmath145 will increase .",
    "indeed , increasing @xmath145 will hardly affect the hamiltonian , whereas it will significantly affect the entropy .",
    "hence , the variable @xmath146 is robust during the process of decoherence , in the sense that @xmath147 will hardly change such that it qualifies as a proper pointer basis .",
    "note however , that @xmath146 is only a pointer basis in the statistical sense , such that there is a well defined probability distribution function from which a measurement can be drawn .",
    "the entropy of a general gaussian state has been derived by sohma , holevo and hirota  @xcite by making use of glauber s p representation for the density operator .",
    "here we present an alternative derivation for the von neumann entropy  ( [ entropy : vn ] ) of a general gaussian state by making use of the replica trick ( see e.g. : @xcite ) .",
    "of course , there are other analogous methods one can use .",

    "<S> it is well known that loss of information about a system , for some observer , leads to an increase in entropy as perceived by this observer . </S>",
    "<S> we use this to propose an alternative approach to decoherence in quantum field theory in which the machinery of renormalisation can systematically be implemented : neglecting observationally inaccessible correlators will give rise to an increase in entropy of the system . as an example we calculate the entropy of a general gaussian state and , assuming the observer s ability to probe this information experimentally , we also calculate the correction to the gaussian entropy for two specific non - gaussian states . </S>"
