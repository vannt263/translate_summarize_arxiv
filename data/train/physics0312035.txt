    "exposing matter to strong and superstrong magnetic fields ( which are fields of the order of @xmath2  t and above ) dramatically changes its properties and yields new and unexpected phenomena . on the microscopic scale ,",
    "i.e. for atomic and molecular systems , magnetic forces have a tremendous influence on the electronic structure and quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "this is due to the different appearances of the coulomb and magnetic forces . from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "strong and superstrong magnetic fields are interesting , because the competing forces prevent a perturbative treatment of the problem .",
    "therefore it is necessary to develop and apply new nonperturbative techniques .",
    "certain astrophysical objects possess strong and superstrong magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs are exposed to fields of the order of 100  ",
    "10@xmath3  t , magnetic fields in the photosphere of neutron stars are of the order of 10@xmath3  10@xmath4  t. for the interpretation of the spectra of these astrophysical objects a wealth of highly accurate atomic and molecular energies , transition wavelengths and transition probabilities are needed .",
    "an example for the analysis of astrophysical spectra of magnetized objects using atomic data in strong fields is the white dwarf grw@xmath5 , which represents a cornerstone for the understanding of magnetic white dwarfs in general @xcite .",
    "highly accurate data are available for hydrogen in strong magnetic fields since more than a decade @xcite .",
    "this system is now understood to a very high degree .",
    "however beyond hydrogen , there is significant interest in detailed data on heavier elements , such as he , na , fe and even molecules . especially helium plays an important role in the atmospheres of magnetic white dwarfs and potentially also neutron stars .",
    "the electronic structure of the helium atom has been considered by several authors during the last decades @xcite .",
    "however most of the corresponding investigations are restricted to a few states or field strengths .",
    "only a few works provide accuracies , that are necessary for astrophysical applications .",
    "recently detailed investigations of helium in the strong field regime have been performed , providing the community with detailed energy levels , transition wavelengths , and transition probabilities , for a dense grid of field strengths in the range of @xmath6  a.u .",
    "( one atomic units corresponds to @xmath7  @xmath8  @xmath2  t ) @xcite .",
    "numerous symmetries and many excited states have been addressed . with the resulting large amount of data it was possible to identify the absorption edges of the observational spectrum of the magnetic white dwarf gd229 @xcite , which have been unexplained for more than 25 years @xcite .    at this point also the work by jones et . al @xcite should be mentioned .",
    "they applied a released - phase quantum monte carlo method in order to evaluate bound state energies and dipole - matrix elements for the ground and a few excited triplet states .",
    "this has been done for a grid of several field strengths @xmath9  a.u .    addressing the superstrong field regime",
    "a further challenge is the problem of the finite nuclear mass .",
    "the dominant energy correction , caused by the finite nuclear mass is for a field of @xmath10  t of the same order of magnitude as the binding energy itself .",
    "this holds even for the energetically lowest states @xcite",
    ". therefore effects due to the finite nuclear mass have to be taken into account for a correct description of the structure of the atom .",
    "up to date there are no detailed studies about the influence of the finite nuclear mass on the transition rates .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to provide results on the transition probabilities for helium in the superstrong field regime . in sect .",
    "[ sec : electromagtrans ] we review the expressions for the transition matrix elements and analyze the influence of the finite nuclear mass . in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we provide our results and discuss some particular features of the transition probabilities as a function of the field strength .",
    "[ sec : concl ] provides a brief conclusion and an outlook .",
    "a detailed comparison of theoretical and observational spectra requires not only the energies and transition wavelengths , but also the corresponding oscillator strengths .",
    "selection rules of allowed and forbidden transitions are of particular importance .",
    "our investigation focuses on the dominant electric dipole transitions . we will shortly review the derivation of the corresponding operators since there are modifications due to the presence of the magnetic field as well as the finite nuclear mass .",
    "our starting point is the pseudo - separated hamiltonian @xcite using relative coordinates @xmath11 for the electrons with respect to the nucleus in atomic units :    @xmath12    here is @xmath13 the total mass of the atom , @xmath14 denotes the pseudo - momentum , and @xmath15 the magnetic field vector .    on the other hand",
    ", we have the operator @xmath16 describing the interaction of the system with the electromagnetic radiation field @xmath17 , neglecting quadratic terms in @xmath17 .",
    "it is given in relative coordinates by @xmath18 here @xmath19 denotes the position vector of electron @xmath20 and @xmath21 the position of the nucleus in the laboratory frame . the radiative part of the electromagnetic field @xmath22 reads in quantized form ( we consider only the creation of photons ) : @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes the creation operator for a photon with wave vector @xmath25 and wavelength @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the polarization vector of the photon , whereas @xmath28 is an amplitude . in the next step",
    ", we will integrate over the center of mass coordinate @xmath29 by calculating the matrix element of @xmath16 between two eigenfunctions of the pseudo - momentum @xmath14 ( eigenvalues are denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) , which are given by expressions of the form : @xmath32 if we assume an integration volume @xmath33 .    the dipole approximation , which reads @xmath34 , leads us in first order time dependent perturbation theory to the following expression for the transition rates : @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , denote the electronic initial and final states , respectively . in the following",
    "we will assume that the wavevector @xmath25 is much smaller than @xmath39 , which is well - justified in atomic transitions .",
    "thus using @xmath40 , we obtain the following expressions for the electronic transitions : @xmath41 these expressions represent the dipole - matrix element , the dipole strength and the oscillator strength , respectively in the velocity representation .    on the other hand we have for the expectation value of the commutator @xmath42|f > & = &    < i|\\frac{m_a}{m_0}\\bm{p}+\\frac{m_0 - 2}{2m_0}\\bm{b}\\times\\bm{r}|f>\\label{eq : comm1}\\\\ & = & ( e_i - e_f)<i|\\bm{r}|f>,\\label{eq : comm2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are symmetrized one - particle operators . applying the identity of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : comm1]),([eq : comm2 ] ) we arrive at the length representation , that reads , @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "these above two representations are equivalent .",
    "however in case of numerical calculations , the two representations yield in general different results .",
    "the relative deviation between the two representations is a good measure for the convergence of the computational method .",
    "only results that obey certain consistency criteria concerning the length to velocity representations of the transition rates are presented .",
    "this ensures in particular the gauge independence of our results .    in the following",
    "we will assume a vanishing pseudo - momentum @xmath47 , which is an appropriate approximation in case of slow moving atoms .",
    "the basic polarization vectors @xmath48 are chosen to be parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field vector , indicated as components @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to the following selection rules for the electromagnetic transitions of the helium atom in a magnetic field @xcite : @xmath51 or @xmath52 and @xmath53 here eq .",
    "( [ eq : circ ] ) , ( [ eq : lin ] ) describe circular and linear polarized transitions , respectively .    to understand the influence of the finite nuclear mass we rewrite the expression for the oscillator strength in the velocity form eq .",
    "( [ eq : osc_str_len ] ) as @xmath54 the energy factor @xmath55 plays a significant role , as we will see below .",
    "one result of ref.@xcite is , that effects of the mass polarization operators are small and therefore in a good approximation results for finite nuclear mass can be expressed in terms of results for infinite nuclear mass : @xmath56 here @xmath57 denotes the total energy of an eigenstate for the hamilton operator of the helium atom for nuclear mass @xmath58 and a field strength @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is a reduced mass .",
    "first we will concentrate on transitions which do not involve tightly bound states . for the corresponding transitions the last , i.e. third term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : redmass ] ) in general cancels in the energy factor of eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans_len_sec ] ) . as a consequence , there are two generic cases ( no tightly bound states involved ) for the influence of the energy factor @xmath55 : in the case of linear polarized transitions , the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 are equal and therefore the energy factor is just scaled by the factor @xmath63 , compared to the results for an infinite nuclear mass .",
    "typically these oscillator strengths are approximately constant as a function of the field strength .",
    "note that the factor @xmath63 deviates for helium about @xmath64 from 1 . in the case of circular",
    "polarized transitions the second term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : redmass ] ) @xmath65 becomes important , since the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath61 and @xmath62 are different .",
    "therefore the linear term @xmath66 is added to the energy factor , which in general causes an increase of the oscillator strengths compared to results for infinite nuclear mass , of the form @xmath67 however , the typical oscillator strengths for circular polarized transitions decrease according to a power law . we note that in case of transitions emanating from tightly bound states the third term on the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eq : redmass ] ) becomes important and in general modifies the pattern for linear polarized transitions .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the energies of magnetically tightly bound states exhibit an inherently different field dependence than the corresponding quantity of non tightly bound states .",
    "the above discussed behavior will be observed when discussing our results of oscillator strengths in sect.[sec : results ] .",
    "some comments on our computational approach are in order .",
    "the calculations are performed using an anisotropic gaussian basis set , which was put forward by schmelcher and cederbaum @xcite , and which has been successfully applied to several atoms , ions and molecules@xcite .",
    "the corresponding basis functions have been optimized for each field strength to solve the one particle problems , i.e. h and he@xmath68 in a magnetic field .",
    "we refer the reader to ref.@xcite for more details .",
    "it has been shown , that this approach yields accurate energies and in particular oscillator strength for helium , by comparing with the corresponding data in the literature @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present and discuss our results on the oscillator strengths of electric dipole transitions of helium in the superstrong field regime . in order to label the states",
    ", we use the standard spectroscopic notation @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath70 indicates the spin multiplicity , @xmath71 is the magnetic quantum number , @xmath72 the z  parity , and @xmath73 the degree of excitation in the corresponding symmetry subspace .",
    "the accuracy for the reported oscillator strengths is between @xmath64 and a few times @xmath74 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite the number of bound states of the helium atom in superstrong magnetic fields becomes finite , i.e. the spectrum terminates , if the effects of the finite nuclear mass are taken into account .",
    "therefore only a finite , usually small number of transitions `` survive '' in the superstrong field regime . on the other hand the ionization threshold ( he  @xmath75  he@xmath68  @xmath76  e@xmath77 ) is up to date not known exactly due to missing detailed investigations on the moving he@xmath68 ion in a magnetic field .",
    "the exact field strength for which a certain state becomes unbound is therefore unknown .",
    "since our basis functions can not properly describe the electronic continuum we report here only on transitions that are known to be energetically well - separated enough from the continuum .",
    "the typical features of oscillator strengths of linear polarized transition , discussed in sect.[sec : electromagtrans ] , can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : osc_0s+sel ]  ( a ) .",
    "the oscillator strengths for several transitions stay constant , or change much less than one order of magnitude . on the other hand transitions emanating from the tightly bound state @xmath78 can be identified by their power law behavior .",
    "a completely different pattern belongs to the transitions @xmath79,@xmath80,@xmath81,@xmath82,@xmath83 , and @xmath84 , depicted in fig .",
