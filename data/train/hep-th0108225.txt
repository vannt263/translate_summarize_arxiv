    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , the model of four fermion interaction , has been discussed as a possible realistic mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking ( @xmath3sb)@xcite . although the interaction is nonrenormalizable in more than @xmath4 spacetime dimensions , it is regarded as a low energy effective theory of elementary fermions after integrations of higgs and/or gauge fields , and has been used as a phenomenological model to describe hadronic spectra , decays , and scattering @xcite .",
    "( while these properties of hadrons should be derived from quantum chromodynamics , analytical methods on hand are so limited that dynamics in the low - energy region could not be easily explored . )    in order to grasp qualitative behavior of a system , it is sometimes useful to examine response to external fields or sources .",
    "many such attempts have been made so far , for example , the @xmath5 gauge - higgs model in a magnetic field source@xcite , fermionic models minimally coupled to strong electromagnetic fields@xcite , the njl model minimally coupled to a constant magnetic field and curved spacetime@xcite and its extension to supersymmetric njl model@xcite , the instanton motivated four - point interaction model of fermion at finite density@xcite , and so forth .    among these , the most interesting outcome is found in the study of the njl model minimally coupled to constant external magnetic fields@xcite ; where mass generation occurs even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions in terms of so called the `` dimensional reduction(dr)''@xcite .",
    "the case is also investigated by the present authors to find that the origin of dr is the infrared divergences followed from the fermion loop integral under the influence of the external magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is now understood universal provided interactions are shortrange@xcite .",
    "inclusion of dynamical gauge fields is made for qed , in terms of the schwinger ",
    "dyson equation@xcite or renormalization group(rg)@xcite .",
    "the results show that the dynamical symmetry breaking always occur with the aid of an external magnetic field .",
    "the motive for this work is traced to that of gusynin , hong , and shovkovy@xcite ; where @xmath1-dimensional @xmath0 gauge theory is investigated in a constant magnetic field by using a constant gauge potential with translational invariance@xcite , to find that magnetic catalysis of @xmath3sb does not occur .",
    "the study in 3 + 1 dimensions is made in the reference @xcite , where @xmath6 gauged njl model is handled in the case of weak as well as constant magnetic field : they incorporate dynamical effect of gluons in rg to reach the conclusion that existence of the external field does not change the condition of @xmath3sb .",
    "each result indicates , contrary to our expectation that gluons always trigger @xmath3sb ( since they do in the low energy region ) , that dynamical gluons in external magnetic field do not play a major role to @xmath3sb .",
    "this curious situation is our starting point .",
    "there needs a more detailed analysis .    in this article",
    "we study @xmath3sb under a constant background magnetic field in @xmath0 gauged njl model , paying attention to ( i ) the direct effect of dynamical gluons to the gap equation , not in terms of rg@xcite , and ( ii ) the effect of gauge choice to the results : since in nonabelian case the situation , @xmath7 , the choice@xcite @xmath8 can not connect with @xcite , @xmath9 since the remnant gauge transformation which leaves @xmath10 invariant , that is , any gauge transformations with respect to the third axis can not bring the gauge ( [ noncovariantchoice ] ) to the gauge ( [ covariantchoice ] ) or vise versa . to work with the green s function in momentum space it is convenient to adopt eq.([noncovariantchoice ] ) , but this is not a solution of the nonabelian maxwell equation in the vacuum , @xmath11 in what follows we rely upon the wkb semi - classical approximation where the classical solution plays a fundamental role .",
    "therefore we should work with the choice eq.([covariantchoice ] ) , satisfying eq.([maxwellequation ] ) .",
    "moreover the choice ( [ covariantchoice ] ) fulfills a covariantly constant condition , @xmath12 enabling us to use the fock  schwinger proper time method@xcite that was originally developed to handle abelian background fields and that gives us a gauge independent result .    for calculations of the functional determinant ,",
    "a regularization for ultraviolet divergence is necessary .",
    "we introduce a proper time cutoff , which preserves gauge symmetry . in addition",
    ", there needs another cutoff : in order to estimate the contribution from dynamical gluons , two - loop order of the effective potential must be taken into account .",
    "the gluon propagator under the magnetic background suffers from the famous instability , due to tachyonic modes of the spin @xmath13 propagator under the background magnetic fields@xcite . to circumvent this instability",
    "we introduce a gluon mass whose square is larger than the magnitude of a magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] a general formulation is presented , where we assume generic backgrounds satisfying the covariantly constant condition eq.([covariantconstant ] ) . in the next sections , sec .",

    "therefore , the increasing tendency of fig.[fig2 ] in @xmath148 comes from the nonabelian parts in eq.([3d2loopgap ] ) .",

    "in this paper we discuss the effect of dynamical @xmath0 gluons to the gap equation of njl model under the influence of the constant background magnetic field .",
    "the two - loop calculations make expressions considerably complicated but correctness of the results is guaranteed by checking the ward - takahashi relation in appendix  [ appd ] . in @xmath2 dimensions , as is seen from fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] , gluons play the same role as fermion in the one - loop , that is , enhance @xmath3sb",

    "dependence of gluons on the background magnetic field , however , is not so simple as in @xmath2 dimensions : as is seen from fig.[fig2 ] , when dynamical mass is tiny the background field increases it , but in a well - broken region , that is , in a region where dynamical mass is large , the background field resists a mass to grow .",
    "difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 dimensions is due to that of the @xmath134 dependence in eqs.([3d2loopgap ] ) and ( [ 4d2loopgap ] ) : by making the scale transformation to @xmath134 and @xmath161 such that @xmath162 quantities , @xmath163 ( [ abc ] ) , scale @xmath164 so that @xmath165 and @xmath166 , ( [ q1 ] ) @xmath167 ( [ q4 ] ) and ( [ p1 ] ) @xmath167 ( [ p4 ] ) transform @xmath168 therefore , @xmath169 which shows a monotone character with respect to @xmath170 , convincing us of the results of fig.[fig1 ] , fig.[fig3 ] , and fig.[fig4 ] , qualitatively .",
    "( because there is still @xmath170 dependence in @xmath171 , and @xmath172 . )",
    "but @xmath173 which implies that dependence on @xmath170 is due only to the detailed structure of the integrand of the expression ( [ 3d2loopgap ] ) , that is , we can not extract a simple monotone behavior in this case .",
    "the second point we wish to discuss is on instability of gluon functional determinant : we have avoided this by introducing gluon mass @xmath54 which is assumed always bigger than the magnitude of background magnetic field @xmath174 ; @xmath175 .",
    "physically , it is interpreted that the energy of nonabelian particles could become lower and lower as the background magnetic field grows larger and larger .",
    "there is no lower limit in the system .",
    "the situation is exactly the same in the constant electric field case , where the vacuum becomes unstable due to successive pair productions .",
    "we have treated this pathological instability by considering only external electric field whose magnitude @xmath176 is less than that of dynamical mass squared ; @xmath177@xcite .",
    "the point is that the setup itself``field theories under constant background field'' is pathological .",
    "the system is not closed ; energy is continuously supplied from outer environment . however , even in these pathological environments , we could still think about those background effects to the systems provided that their magnitude is so small .",
    "the final point to discuss is beyond the tree approximation of the auxiliary fields @xmath28 and @xmath178 : in most cases of njl - study , fermions are assumed to have @xmath179 components with @xmath179 being supposed infinite finally .",
    "however in the actual situation @xmath179 is finite so that @xmath180 corrections should be taken into account .",
