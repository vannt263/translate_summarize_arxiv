    "during the past decade a large effort has been made to understand the multifragmentation ( mf ) process in heavy ion reactions . recently",
    "a number of review articles have appeared describing the details of this phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the purdue group was the first to suggest that nuclear mf might be a critical phenomenon - a second order phase transition occurring near a critical point@xcite . in an inclusive experiment performed at fermilab , the spectra of mass identified fragments resulting from proton interactions with both kr and xe gas targets were measured @xcite .",
    "the discovery that the yields of fragments with mass @xmath6 produced in p+kr and p+xe reactions , with proton beam energy from 80 to 350 gev , obeyed a power law @xmath7 , with @xmath8 @xcite generated theoretical interest in mf in terms of a continuous phase transition .",
    "a similar power law was also predicted by fisher @xcite for a mass distribution of droplets at a liquid - gas phase transition critical point .",
    "thus the results from the purdue work gave a hint that mf could provide important information about the equation of state of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the fragment kinetic energy spectra suggested that the fragments are emitted from a less than normal density system in the decay of a common remnant which is lighter than the target@xcite .",
    "an analysis of the fragment yields based on a thermal liquid drop model gave a freeze - out temperature of @xmath9 5 mev @xcite .",
    "similar results were observed when the above study was extended to lower energies@xcite .",
    "this view was supported by exclusive emulsion mf data @xcite , which were analyzed by campi to show that the conditional moments of the individual fragment events exhibited characteristics of a phase transition @xcite .",
    "bauer and campi were the first to apply the methods used in percolation studies to analyze mf data @xcite .",
    "in percolation theory the moments of the cluster distribution contain the signature of critical behavior @xcite .    in recent years",
    "further progress was made by experiments in which practically all the fragments emitted in a given event were detected , thereby permitting complete reconstruction of mf events @xcite .",
    "the aladin collaboration studied the mf of 400a-1000a mev xe , au , and u nuclei on various targets .",
    "their results showed that fragment yields were independent of the entrance channel when the data were scaled for projectile or target mass @xcite .",
    "the eos collaboration studied the mf of 1a gev gold on carbon and analyzed the data using methods developed in the study of critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "several critical exponents were determined and their values suggested that the mf of au can be understood as due to a continuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "the first results of the mf of 1a gev la and kr on carbon have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the mf transition appears to involve the breakup of a nucleus to form several imf s .",
    "the production of nucleons and light particles - the nuclear analog of a gas- occurs largely in the fragment deexcitation step@xcite . along with the earlier inclusive studies",
    ", these experiments suggested that prior to mf the remnant formed in the prompt stage achieves thermal equilibrium .",
    "a two step process was proposed for the collision .",
    "this two step process is an idealization of a time dependent process . in the first prompt",
    "stage nucleons are knocked out of the participants .",
    "the emission of these prompt particle leaves an equilibrated remnant nucleus which undergoes deexcitation in a second step .    in the eos experiment prompt",
    "stage was separated from the mf stage by making a cut on the kinetic energy of light charged particles@xcite .",
    "this separation was made possible by the ability of the eos detector to measure nearly all the charged particles and fragments emitted in each event using reverse kinematics@xcite .",
    "complete reconstruction and stage separation was therefore possible for a majority of the events .",
    "these reconstructed events were characterized by mass , charge , and excitation energy of the remnant .",
    "the resultant remnant then undergoes mf to produce excited fragments which then undergo secondary decay to produce the observed fragments @xcite .",
    "the aladin experiment is also capable of measuring all the charged particles except for z=1 particles@xcite .",
    "the isis collaboration has also produced one of the most complete mf data sets in the high energy collision of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 with gold @xcite . in the isis experiment",
    "the charge and mass of the excited source were obtained on an event by event basis by subtracting the non equilibrium particles from the target charge and mass . however",
    ", the non - equilibrium particles could only be separated from the thermal particles by means of a parametrization involving two component moving source fits .",
    "the eos@xcite data can be compared with statistical models .",
    "there are several statistical models which have been used to study mf , @xcite but the most widely used are the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) @xcite and monte carlo microcanonical model ( mmmc ) @xcite . the theoretical interest in mf is not confined to only statistical models but several other approaches to study mf have been carried out e.g. percolation , lattice gauge and ising models @xcite .",
    "a phenomenological droplet model @xcite , based on the fisher@xcite droplet model , has also been used to describe the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear reactions . here",
    "we shall compare the experimental data with the predictions of the smm model in the manner presented in previous publications @xcite .",
    "we found that this model is in good agreement with a variety of results for the mf of 1a gev au @xcite .",
    "smm requires mass , charge and excitation energy of the remnant as input . using the experimental remnants from au+c ,",
    "the parameters of the smm were fixed based on the agreement between smm and data . some comparisons with the data for la+c and kr+c",
    "were also made in later work using the same set of parameters as in case of au+c @xcite .",

    "the details of the experiment are given in our earlier publications @xcite .",
    "only a brief description will be given here .",
    "the experiment was done with the eos time projection chamber ( tpc)@xcite and a multiple sampling ionization chamber ( music ii)@xcite .",
    "the tpc provided almost 4 @xmath16 solid angle coverage in the center - of - mass system .",
    "three - dimensional tracking and charged particle identification permitted momentum and energy reconstruction of fragments with charges in the range of @xmath17 .",
    "particle identification was based on specific energy loss along particle tracks .",
    "music ii detected and tracked fragments with charges @xmath18 .",
    "the excellent charge resolution of this detector permitted identification of all detected fragments .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on fully reconstructed mf events for which the total charge of the system was taken as @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for au , la , and kr , respectively @xcite .",
    "approximately @xmath22 32000 , 26000 , and 42000 events met the above criteria for au , la and kr , respectively .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the remnant refers to the equilibrated nucleus formed after the emission of prompt particles .",
    "this remnant then undergoes mf .",
    "the charge and mass of the remnant were obtained by removing for each event the total charge of the prompt particles . in order to obtain the mass ,",
    "the number of prompt neutrons was estimated by means of the isabel cascade calculation@xcite .",
    "the excitation energy per nucleon of the remnant , @xmath23 , was based on an energy balance between the excited remnant and the final stage of the fragments@xcite for each event , as discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .    in our previous work",
    "we have shown that some of the excitation energy of the remnant includes a nonthermal component which may be ascribable to expansion energy , @xmath24@xcite .",
    "the thermal excitation energy @xmath25 of the remnants is obtained as the difference between @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "this energy is an important quantity both for input to smm and for the physics analysis of the data .",
    "fig.[auremn ] show plots of @xmath27 , @xmath28 and total charged particle multiplicity , @xmath29 , for au , la , and kr , respectively , as a function of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the plots in fig.[auremn ] show the nature of the remnant originating from the different system sizes . in case of au and la",
    "one finds that the remnant size at the highest multiplicity is nearly @xmath30 of the initial remnant size , while for kr the remnant loses up to @xmath22 70 @xmath31 of the initial mass .",
    "the range of @xmath32 is also different in the three cases . for kr",
    "the remnant reaches @xmath25 as high as @xmath22 20 mev / nucleon , while for au and la the maximum @xmath25 are @xmath33 and @xmath22 12 mev / nucleon , respectively .",
    "figure [ auremn ] shows the variation of the average @xmath29 with @xmath25 , but does not give an indication of event - to - event fluctuations .",
    "fig.[2dmult ] shows a contour plot of @xmath29 vs @xmath32 .",
    "these two quantities are fairly closely correlated for au and la and confirm the linear variation shown in fig.[auremn ] .",
    "the correlation is much poorer for kr and a broad range of energies corresponds to a narrow range of @xmath29 values above 8 mev / nucleon .",
    "we first examine the second stage fragment multiplicities , @xmath34 .",
    "fig.[m2eth ] shows a plot of @xmath34 vs @xmath25 for au , la , and , kr .",
    "the @xmath34 for au and la increase linearly with @xmath25 , while for kr @xmath34 increases slowly up to @xmath25@xmath22 8 mev / nucleon and remains essentially constant at higher @xmath25 .",
    "the constancy of @xmath34 above 8 mev / nucleon suggests that the system may be disintegrating into individual nucleons and light particles , which suggests that the vaporization process becomes dominant .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by the variation with @xmath25 of the size of the largest fragment , @xmath35 , in each event as shown in fig.[amaxeth ] .",
    "it is observed for kr that above @xmath22 8 - 9 mev / nucleon the value of @xmath35 is nearly constant with a value of @xmath36 .",

    "we define imfs as having nuclear charges ranging from z=3 to z=@xmath37 .",
    "fig.[imfeth ] shows that for all the three systems the peak in imfs is @xmath38 mev / nucleon although the imf peak for au is not well defined as @xmath25 @xmath39 8 mev / nucleon was hardly achieved for this projectile .",
    "the drop in imf yields for au has been seen when the data were plotted as a function of @xmath29 rather than @xmath25 because of the dispersion in @xmath29 values at a given @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "note that the number of imfs from kr drops to substantially less than 1 above 10 mev / nucleon .",
    "this is another confirmation of the results given in the preceding section showing the vaporization of the kr remnants at high @xmath25 .",
    "= 8.5 cm    imf production has been studied as a function of projectile bombarding energy by the aladin collaboration @xcite .",
    "they showed that the excitation energy dependence of the average imf number for xe , au , and u projectiles when scaled by charge of the emitting source is similar , suggesting that the imf production mechanism is independent of the entrance channel .",
    "a universal scaling for imf production has also been seen from a wide range of source masses ( 35 -190 nucleons ) produced in reactions with energies from 35 to 600 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "the variable volume version of smm has been used in this work for comparison with the data .",
    "this variable volume corresponds approximately to the condition of constant ( close to zero ) pressure @xcite .",
    "smm is a statistical description of the simultaneous breakup of an expanded excited nucleus into nucleons and hot fragments @xcite .",
    "individual fragments at normal nuclear density are described with a charged liquid drop parameterization .",

    "the critical temperature , at which the surface tension of neutral nuclear matter droplets would go to zero , is in the range suggested by infinite neutral nuclear matter calculations @xcite .",
    "the two important parameters of the model are the coulomb reduction parameter , @xmath42 , and the inverse level density parameter @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 parameter was fixed with the comparison of the measured free volume from smm to that of the initial volume obtained in the collision process for the au+c data .",
    "the details are given in  ref.@xcite .",
    "the only remaining parameter , @xmath43 , was obtained from the detailed comparison of smm results with the various experimental fragment properties , e.g. second stage multiplicity , size of the biggest fragment , and imfs using au+c data @xcite . in this work",
    "the same value of @xmath42=2 and @xmath43=16 mev has been used in smm to compare results with data for la and kr . the best agreement with the data",

    "both show the same initial increase in imf production and a peak at approximately the same energy .",
    "smm follows the trend in the kr data in the vaporization regime , where the imf multiplicity decreases to zero at the highest energy .",
    "smm overestimates the number of imf at the peak in all three cases .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that in smm there is overproduction of li and be fragments at higher excitation energies .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the above comparison between data and smm was done with smm calculations including the deexcitation of secondary fragments .",
    "smm can also be stopped prior to secondary decay to obtain information about the smm primary fragments .",

    "the observed @xmath129 for a=160 is @xmath22 6 mev .",

    "achieving multifragmentation in this system requires greater excitation energy / nucleon compared to au and la ( as shown in fig .",

    "= 8.5 cm    it has also been suggested on the basis of a caloric curve that mf of au is a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "this observation was based on the the fact that the temperature remains constant as energy is increased between 3 and 10 mev / nucleon .",

    "the imfs survive the cooling process at least for au and la and identify the mf transition . in case of kr the excitation energies of imf from @xmath45 are very high and very few are seen in the cold stage . thus the mf signal could be washed out .",
    "in the present work we presented and analyzed the data from the mf of 1a gev au , la and kr on carbon .",

    "a back bending in temperature vs energy plot is a sign of negative specific heat and hence a first order phase transition .",
    "such a result is found for kr but not for au , except for the lightest remnants , the mf contribution of which is negligible .",
    "the temperature obtained from the isotope ratio analysis decreases with an increase in system size at the critical point .",
    "the break - up temperature obtained from smm also follows the same trend , but higher by @xmath22 1 mev / nucleon .",
    "the decrease in temperature with increase in system size is an important result as it is in the opposite direction from what is observed in either in 3d percolation or ising model studies for finite size neutral matter .",
    "this shows that if finite size were the only effect in mf then the correlation between temperature and system size would have been the same in data as in percolation and ising model studies .",
    "thus , the long range coulomb force is shown to be the dominant factor in mf .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by hartree - fock calculations .    in conclusion , this is the first work in which the nature of the phase transition in mf has been explored using three systems of different size .",

    "the back bending in the caloric curve for kr suggests the presence of latent heat , which is consistent with a first order phase transition .",

    "<S> a systematic analysis of the multifragmentation ( mf ) in fully reconstructed events from 1a gev au , la and kr collisions with c has been performed . </S>",
    "<S> this data is used to provide a definitive test of the variable volume version of the statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) . </S>",
    "<S> a single set of smm parameters directly determined by the data and the semi - empirical mass formula are used after the adjustable inverse level density parameter , @xmath0 is determined by the fragment distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the results from smm for second stage multiplicity , size of the biggest fragment and the intermediate mass fragments are in excellent agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> multifragmentation thresholds have been obtained for all three systems using smm prior to secondary decay . </S>",
    "<S> the data indicate that both thermal excitation energy @xmath1 and the isotope ratio temperature @xmath2 decrease with increase in system size at the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the breakup temperature obtained from smm also shows the same trend as seen in the data . </S>",
    "<S> the smm model is used to study the nature of the mf phase transition . the caloric curve for kr exhibits back - bending ( finite latent heat ) while the caloric curves for au and la are consistent with a continuous phase transition ( nearly zero latent heat ) and the values of the critical exponents @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , both from data and smm , are close to those for a liquid - gas system for au and la . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the larger coulomb expansion energy in au and la reduces the latent heat required for mf and changes the nature of the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus the coulomb energy plays a major role in nuclear mf .    6.5 in </S>"
