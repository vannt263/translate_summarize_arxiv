    "a locally self - interacting random walk on the set of integers is a sequence of integer - valued random variables @xmath2 with @xmath3 for all @xmath4 , that can be defined inductively as follows : one initializes a `` local time profile '' by first choosing some function @xmath5 that associates to each edge @xmath6 of the lattice @xmath7 a real number @xmath8 ( the set @xmath9 of unoriented edges can be identified to the set @xmath10 or to the set of couples @xmath11 where @xmath12 ) and one chooses the starting point @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest choice is of course to set this initial function @xmath5 to be equal to zero on all edges , and to start at the origin ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) with probability one .",
    "the law of the walker is then described via some function @xmath15 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "this function describes the probability of jumping to the right in terms of the local time profile `` seen from the walker at its current position '' .",
    "more precisely , one defines inductively , for each @xmath4 , @xmath18 to be equal to either @xmath19 or @xmath20 in such a way that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the local time profile seen from the particle at time @xmath23 . at each step ,",
    "one updates this local time profile as follows : @xmath24 denotes the edge of the @xmath25-th jump and @xmath26 is the new local time profile .",
    "when @xmath5 is identically zero , then @xmath27 denotes the number of times the walk has jumped on the edge @xmath6 before time @xmath23 .",
    "this procedure clearly describes completely the law of the family @xmath28 .",
    "similar definitions work of course on other graphs than @xmath7 ( for instance on @xmath29 ) . in the present paper",
    ", we will however restrict our discussion to the one - dimensional case .",
    "one can also use local times on sites instead of edges but the latter case turns out to be often easier to handle .    depending on the function @xmath15 ,",
    "the walker can be of self - repelling type ( it prefers to go into the direction it has less visited in the past ) , self - attracting , or more complicated ( it can be for instance repelled by the visits to the neighbouring edge , but attracted by its past visits to further edges ) .",
    "when the function @xmath15 is `` cylindric '' i.e. when @xmath30 is a function on the values @xmath31 for a finite set of edges @xmath32 , the interaction can be described as `` local '' . in other words , for some constant @xmath33 , the past trajectory @xmath34 influences the outcome of @xmath35 only via the values of @xmath27 for the edges in the @xmath33-neighbourhood of @xmath36 .",
    "note that in this cylindric case , if there is a large scale limit to the process @xmath2 its evolution will be `` purely '' local as the finite - range becomes scaled down .",
    "such locally self - interacting walks provide a particular class of random evolutions of functions as the sequence of functions @xmath37 form a markov process .",
    "it is in fact very natural to study the evolutions where the function @xmath15 is also height - invariant i.e. the particular case where @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and all real @xmath40 . in other words ,",
    "the walk is sensitive to the local discrete gradient of @xmath41 but not to its actual height .",
    "this excludes for instance the family of `` linear '' reinforcements ( see for instance @xcite for a survey of these other types of reinforcements ) .",
    "another way to view these evolutions is to define , for all @xmath12 and @xmath4 , the local gradient @xmath42 and to say that @xmath43 is in fact a function @xmath44 of @xmath45 .    in @xcite , a case where @xmath46 was just a function of @xmath47",
    "was studied . loosely speaking , this",
    "walk ( sometimes referred to as true self - avoiding walk or true self - repelling walk  tsrw ) is driven by the negative gradient of the local time at its actual position i.e. , the walk prefers to go in the direction it has visited less often in the past .",
    "it turns out that a non - trivial scaling shows up , as @xmath48 converges in law to some non - trivial random variable .",
    "in fact , the entire limiting process can be described @xcite ( it is called the true self - repelling motion  tsrm ) .",
    "it corresponds to a random and local evolution of functions , that is neither a deterministic partial differential equation nor constructed via a white - noise driven stochastic partial differential equation .",
    "this raises the questions whether other such processes exist , whether the previous scaling limit is `` stable '' ( do all similar discrete models have the same limiting behaviour ? what properties of the discrete model is actually captured by this scaling limit ? ) , and provides a motivation to study self - interacting random walks associated to more general functions @xmath15 .",
    "the family of models that we will focus on in the present paper are those where the self - interaction is governed by a linear combination of the values of the local time .",
    "in other words , we let @xmath49 where all but finitely many @xmath50 s are zero , and we choose the local `` drift '' at step @xmath23 according to the value of @xmath51 .",
    "the fact that this evolution in height - invariant corresponds to the condition @xmath52 then , we take @xmath53 for some increasing function @xmath54 such that @xmath55 . in other words , if @xmath56 is ( very ) positive ( respectively , negative ) , then the walk will tend to jump to the right ( respectively , to the left ) , so that @xmath56 indeed plays the role of a local drift .",
    "a particularly natural choice for @xmath54 turns out to be @xmath57    in order to start investigating the variety of possible behaviours , one can for instance start to look at the case where @xmath58 is a function of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 .",
    "a first natural choice is to pick two real numbers @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and to drive the walker by the linear combination @xmath65 note that these are the choices such that both height - invariance ( because the sum of the terms @xmath66 is zero ) and _ left - right symmetry _ ( the walks @xmath67 and @xmath68 have the same law because the coefficients in front of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are opposite ) hold .",
    "note that when @xmath64 is positive and @xmath71 , this is the previously mentioned tsrw with tsrm as scaling limit .",
    "when @xmath72 and @xmath73 is very small , one can therefore view this process as a perturbation of the tsrw . at the other end of the picture ,",
    "when @xmath64 is negative , it is easy to check that the walk will ( with positive probability ) eventually jump back and forth on one single edge ( the more it jumps on it , the more it is attracted by it ) which is not a particularly interesting case . in section [ s2 ] , we will describe various possible asymptotic behaviours , depending on the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we shall see that intuition can sometimes be misleading ; repellance by second neighbours does not always have the same effect as repellance by immediate neighbours as it can create traps .",
    "one interesting feature that we will mention is the existence ( when @xmath74 ) of a phase transition between stuck walks ( that can eventually remain in a finite interval ) and the non - stuck ones ( with almost surely an infinite range ) , depending on whether @xmath75 or not .",
    "a second natural possibility is to break the left - right symmetry , and to drive the walker by a linear combination such as @xmath76 which will be among those studied in section [ s3 ] ( with deterministic transient behaviour of the walker ) .",
    "section [ s2 ] is more of survey - type presenting results proved in @xcite , as well as heuristics and conjectures , while section [ s3 ] , will contain original results with actual proofs .    throughout the paper",
    ", we will mention results that hold with positive probability , like `` with positive probability , the walk will eventually remain stuck on a single edge '' .",
    "clearly , one then implicitly conjectures that this is the generic behaviour of the walk ( i.e. that the corresponding asymptotic event will hold almost surely ) , but in general , proving such almost sure results for self - interacting walks is not a straightforward task ( and it requires different arguments ) , see for instance @xcite for the linearly reinforced walk . we will not focus on these questions in the present paper .",
    "we would like to emphasize here that ( despite the `` phase diagram '' that we will draw at the end of the next section ) the aim of the present paper is not to give a full classification of the possible asymptotic behaviour of all these cylindric self - interacting walks .",
    "our goal is rather to point out certain phenomenological features , in order to shed some light on how sensitive ( or not ) these walks are with respect to their microscopic definition , and what feature is kept in the scaling limit .    * a warm - up .",
    "* as a warm - up to maybe help ( if it does not help the reader , then she / he should not hesitate to skip this paragraph as it will not be essential later on ) the following analysis , let us make some non - rigorous analogy with fibonacci - type sequences and their related polynomials . recall that our models are `` driven '' by a linear combination of the type @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "if a walk is in some local equilibrium state ( it does not `` shoot in one direction '' , it is somewhere in the middle of its past range , and the values of @xmath41 are all very large ) , then one could expect that the value of @xmath56 is rather small at most of the sites ( at least compared to the total number of steps ) .",
    "after renormalization by the number of steps , this would indicate that @xmath79 i.e. that @xmath80 follows some fibonacci - type progression .",
    "as we know , the behaviour of such progressions is controlled by the values ( and position with respect to the unit circle ) of the roots of the corresponding polynomial @xmath81 where @xmath82 the fact that the dynamics is height - invariant corresponds to the case where @xmath83 is a root of @xmath84 .",
    "hence , it is in a way more appropriate to describe the self - interaction by its polynomial ( in the case where the self - interaction is left - right symmetric , it does indeed characterize the self - interaction ) , and we will use this when we will illustrate some of our simulations . note that the function @xmath85 , defined for @xmath86 is actually the fourier transform of the sequence @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the qualitative behaviour of the walk will depend on the type of the fibonacci polynomial @xmath81 , or , what is equivalent of the fourier transform of the sequence of coefficients @xmath87 .",
    "e.g. , positive definiteness of this sequence plays an essential role .",
    "during most of this section , the setup is the one described in the introduction , where the walk is `` driven '' by @xmath88 , i.e. when we are considering the next - to - neighbouring interactions that are both height - invariant and left - right symmetric ( we will comment on interactions with larger range at the end of the section ) .",
    "the meaning of @xmath63 and @xmath64 is as follows :    * if @xmath64 is positive ( respectively , negative ) , then the walk is repelled ( respectively , attracted ) by its previous visits to the neighbouring edge . * @xmath63 plays the same role as @xmath64 but for the next - to - neigboring edges . *",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath89 describe the intensity of these self - interactions .",
    "as we shall see , in most of these cases , the qualitative asymptotic behaviour of the walk will depend on the signs of @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and on the ratio between @xmath73 and @xmath89 .",
    "we can divide the parameter space into several classes .",
    "let us first notice that in the case where @xmath90 , then with positive probability , the walk @xmath36 will forever jump back and forth along one singe edge ( between @xmath91 and @xmath83 , say ) .",
    "this is easily checked using the borel - cantelli lemma .",
    "similarly , when @xmath92 and @xmath63 is negative , then with positive probability , the walk will be stuck on a set of two edges ( say , it will visit only the three sites @xmath91 , @xmath83 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "these are the _",
    "purely self - attractive cases_.      let us first very briefly recall here the case where @xmath94 and @xmath71 : the walker is then driven by the negative gradient of the local time at its current position . as we have already mentioned , this is the so - called true self - repelling walk tsrw steps is consistent with the distribution of the first @xmath96 steps  and this is not always the case for measures on self - avoiding or self - repelling walks ; the term `` myopic '' random walk has also been used . ] .",
    "this scaling limit was clarified in @xcite and @xcite ; it is the true self - repelling motion ( trsm ) .    , @xmath97 , @xmath98.,height=192 ]",
    "it is quite natural to expect that this tsrw scaling behaviour is stable under perturbation , i.e. when choosing @xmath99 , but sufficiently small ( in absolute value ) .",
    "there are some good reasons to guess that in the parameter range @xmath100 ( and for @xmath94 ) , the long time asymptotic behaviour and scaling limit of the walk is similar to the tsrw case . indeed , besides numerical evidence , one can note that :    1 .   in this parameter range",
    ", we can identify a stationary and ergodic distribution of the `` environment seen by the random walker '' process .",
    "this distribution is qualitatively similar to the tsrw case , the difference being that instead of a product measure we get an exponentially mixing gibbs measure . for details ,",
    "see subsection [ sstationary ] below . 2 .   in this stationary and ergodic regime , using the variational method initiated in @xcite and exploited in @xcite for similar but continuous space - time models",
    ", one could very likely obtain superdiffusive lower bounds of the type @xmath101 for the asymptotic variance of the displacement of the random walker . for details of similar computations in continuous space - time , see @xcite .      in this regime",
    ", the competition between the nearest edge self - repellence due to @xmath102 and next - to - nearest edge self - attractiveness due to @xmath104 is won by the latter because @xmath73 is large enough , and the random walker is eventually trapped in an interval of finite length .",
    "the length of the trapping interval increases to infinity as the ratio @xmath105 decreases to the critical value @xmath106 .",
    "more precisely , let us define for all positive integer @xmath107 , @xmath108 this is an increasing sequence ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the following theorem is proved :    [ thm_sticky ] suppose that @xmath113 .",
    "* if @xmath114 for some @xmath115 , then with positive probability , the walk remains stuck on a set of @xmath116 consecutive sites ( and visits all these sites infinitely often ) . * if @xmath117 , then almost surely , the walk does not get stuck on a set with less than @xmath116 sites .    for instance , for some values of the parameter @xmath73 larger but very close to @xmath118 , the walk can remain stuck on a set of exactly @xmath119 sites . on the other hand , when @xmath120 , then the walk does almost surely not get stuck on a finite set .    , @xmath121 ) stuck on 11 sites : the trajectory and the local time , title=\"fig:\",height=163 ] , @xmath121 ) stuck on 11 sites : the trajectory and the local time , title=\"fig:\",height=163 ]    for proof of theorem [ thm_sticky ] and more refined details on the asymptotic behaviour of the walk in this particular trapping regime see @xcite .",
    "in this regime , nearest and next - to - nearest edges are all repelling .",
    "nevertheless these effects do not just always add up to produce a tsrm - type asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the second neighbours can produce traps that are difficult to get out from .    in order to illustrate this ,",
    "let us describe a scenario of building up traps , for the extreme case where @xmath92 and @xmath124 : the random walk starts by jumping back and forth on the edge @xmath125 between @xmath91 and @xmath83 a large even number @xmath126 of times .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath127 .",
    "then , in some @xmath128 number of steps it moves to site @xmath129 .",
    "( note , that due to the large number of visits at edge @xmath125 the walker does not have a chance to return from site @xmath130 . )",
    "now , it performs yet again a number of @xmath131 back and forth jumps on the edge @xmath132 ( between sites @xmath129 and @xmath133 ) .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath134 .",
    "after all this , in @xmath128 number of steps the walker lands on edge @xmath135 ( between sites @xmath136 an @xmath130 ) .",
    "now , due to the @xmath131 number of visits at edges @xmath125 and @xmath132 the walker does not have a chance to get away from edge @xmath135 before jumping @xmath137 times back and forth on this edge .",
    "hence , we see that while it is very unlikely to build up a trap ( and it therefore typically takes a long time to build up one ) , once it is built and if @xmath138 is large enough , then it takes even much longer to escape from it .",
    "in fact , the previously described strategy to build such traps is certainly not the optimal one , and the probability to create one is in fact smaller , so that for all positive @xmath63 , it takes much longer to escape from the trap than to create it .",
    "this slowing - down mechanism is reminiscent of that of random walks in random environment , and it indicates that there is no scaling limit process with continuous trajectories .     and @xmath92 : the trajectory and the local time , title=\"fig:\",height=163 ]   and @xmath92 : the trajectory and the local time , title=\"fig:\",height=163 ]",
    "when @xmath64 is positive , we do not have precise results at this point for the two borderline cases where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "* @xmath141 is the borderline case between the conjectural tsrm regime ( where the walk should scale like @xmath142 ) and the sticky regime ( when the walk is eventually stuck to a finite interval ) .",
    "we have seen that the walk does almost surely not stay in a finite interval , but its asymptotic behaviour is not really well understood .",
    "naive scaling arguments ( and the stationary measure computations mentioned at the very end of the next section ) would at first suggest that the non - degenerate scaling of the walk should be like @xmath143 .",
    "but it can be rigorously proved that in a stationary regime there exists a diffusive lower bound on the asymptotic variance of the displacement , and intuitively , one might guess diffusive behaviour ( the stationary local time regime  see also figure [ figlt3 ]  and the walk displacement might have different scaling exponents and not interact in the large - scale limit ) .",
    "+ : the trajectory , height=192 ] * the case where @xmath140 can be interpreted as the tsrw with self - repulsion defined in terms of occupation times on sites rather than edges .",
    "its scaling behaviour is expected to be similar to the tsrw on edges ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "figure [ phased ] sums up the rough phase diagram of the asymptotic behaviour of the walk depending on the values of @xmath144 on the unit circle .     on the unit circle , height=288 ]      we now quickly survey some computations related to the existence of stationary measures for the current environment ( i.e. , the local time fluctuations ) as seen from the random walk in the conjectural `` tsrm '' regime .",
    "we will work in the more general context where the dynamics is driven by a height - invariant linear function of the local time i.e. where @xmath146 with @xmath147 where all but finitely many @xmath148 s are zero .",
    "we will write @xmath149 .",
    "it is convenient to work with an initial profile @xmath150 that belongs to the set @xmath151 it is immediate to check that this parity condition will be conserved for all @xmath152 ( the opposite parity convention i.e. @xmath153 would also be preserved ) so that @xmath154 is a markov chain on @xmath155 .",
    "we can also restrict ourselves to the family of @xmath156 s in @xmath155 with finite norm @xmath157 .",
    "we will use the following notation .",
    "if @xmath158 i.e. @xmath159 jumps to the right , we write @xmath160 , and if it jumps to the left , we write @xmath161 .",
    "in other words , for all @xmath162 , @xmath163 the markov chain is described by the fact that ( given @xmath164 ) @xmath165 is equal to @xmath166 with conditional probability @xmath167 , and that @xmath161 otherwise .",
    "the transition operator of the markov process is therefore @xmath168    as often , it is convenient to view this markov chain as the jump chain associated to a continuous - time markov chain on the same state space .",
    "this continuous - time markov chain @xmath169 jumps to the right with intensity @xmath170 and to the left with intensity @xmath171 .",
    "the particular choice for the dynamics leads us naturally to look for a stationary distribution for @xmath172 of `` discrete gaussian type '' .",
    "we are going to suppose in the present section that :    * @xmath173 is even ( i.e. , @xmath174 for all @xmath162 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the left - right symmetry mentioned in the introduction . *",
    "the self - interaction has finite spatial range ( i.e. , all but finitely many @xmath148 s are equal to zero ) * it is positive definite in the sense that for all @xmath175 such that all of them but a finite positive number is equal to zero , @xmath176 ( this implies in particular that @xmath177 ) .    note that in the case where @xmath178 and @xmath94 , this last condition precisely means that @xmath179",
    ".    under these assumptions there exists a unique gibbs measure @xmath180 on @xmath155 formally given by @xmath181 the proper , rigorous definition of the gibbs measure @xmath180 is in terms of conditional specifications on finite intervals , given fixed boundary conditions .",
    "this gibbs measure is well understood , and its correlations decay exponentially fast with distance and the zero - one law holds for tail events .    under the previous assumptions ,",
    "the probability measure @xmath180 is stationary and ergodic for the markov process @xmath172 .",
    "the proof is straightforward and based on the following observation : @xmath182 and similar formulae when one replaces @xmath183 by @xmath184 .",
    "it proves that in fact the measure @xmath180 is invariant under the process with `` right - jumps '' only , and under the process with `` left - jumps '' only .",
    "ergodicity also follows from the above observation .",
    "the dirichlet form @xmath185 is easily computed . using the above observation we get @xmath186 hence , since @xmath187 almost surely , it follows that @xmath188 if and only if almost surely @xmath189 but it is standard fact that the above almost sure identities hold if and only if @xmath190 is tail measurable . hence , by the zero - one law mentioned before , @xmath190 is almost surely constant .",
    "this proves ergodicity .",
    "also , one can note that the mean waiting time of the continuous - time markov chain at @xmath156 is given by @xmath191 and that @xmath192 is finite . from this",
    ", it follows that one can define a probability measure @xmath193 on @xmath155 by @xmath194 and that :    this probability measure @xmath193 is stationary for the discrete chain @xmath195 .",
    "hence , we see that in this regime , and under these well - chosen starting distributions , the large - scale behaviour of the local - time profile is of brownian - type .",
    "we can note that in the borderline case where @xmath94 and @xmath141 ( i.e. the discrete `` third derivative '' case ) , the previous stationary distribution analysis can be adapted to show that the discrete gradient of @xmath172 ( that is : the discrete second derivative of the local time profile ) has a stationary measure of discrete gaussian type .",
    "more precisely , we see in this interesting case that if we define for all @xmath196 , @xmath197 then the process @xmath198 is a markov process , and that it has a stationary distribution given by i.i.d . discrete gaussians .    for details of similar computations of stationary and ergodic measures of the environment seen by the moving particle , in continuous space - time setup , and",
    "their consequences see also @xcite .",
    "[ figlt3 ]      to conclude this section , let us very quickly list a few observations :    * in the setting of the tsrw , it was natural to describe the dynamics of the walker by saying that it was driven by an approximate negative gradient of the local time at its current position , and the dynamics of its scaling limit could also be described in this way .",
    "our previous analysis however shows that this type of description has to be handled with care .",
    "the case @xmath199 seems at first to also correspond to a negative discrete gradient , but its large scale behaviour is completely different .",
    "* in fact , in the general case , what seems more relevant to classify the asymptotic behaviour of the walk is the quadratic form appearing in ( [ qform ] ) or alternatively the study of the roots of @xmath200 .",
    "this is also apparent in the study of the stuck walks in @xcite .",
    "note also that the borderline cases correspond to ( multiples of ) the polynomials @xmath201 and @xmath202 . in the general case ( with larger interaction - range )",
    ", the phase diagram is seemingly more complicated , with different connected components of the parameter space corresponding to similar asymptotic behaviours . * a particular role",
    "is then played by the `` odd '' derivatives , i.e. more precisely , the polynomials @xmath203 .",
    "then , the discrete @xmath23-th derivative of @xmath204 ( and therefore of @xmath156 ) has a stationary measure of discrete gaussian type .",
    "let us stress that ( as opposed to the cases studied in the previous section ) , the examples studied in the present section break the left - right symmetry i.e. the law of @xmath2 and @xmath205 are different even if one chooses @xmath5 to be symmetric .      in this section , we will first focus on the case where @xmath206 , where @xmath207 we then choose @xmath208 which penalizes jumps in the direction of this second derivative .",
    "the precise form of the function @xmath15 is not really important for what follows .",
    "for instance , our results clearly remain true if we only assume in addition of locality and height - invariance , that    * @xmath209 . * @xmath43 is a function of @xmath210 goes to @xmath91 very quickly as @xmath211 .",
    "these conditions can in fact also be relaxed .",
    "note that @xmath212 is a discrete and symmetric version of the second derivative of the local time , but this feature is not essential in what follows .",
    "intuitively speaking , the walk will tend to move to the right if the local time profile is locally concave and to the left if it is locally convex .",
    "the main result of the present section is the following : suppose that the initial profile is identically zero ( again , this is not really necessary  we only need this initial profile not to be too `` wild '' ) .",
    "then :    [ t2 ] with positive probability , @xmath213 as @xmath214 .    on large scale and on a positive fraction of the probability space ,",
    "the walk becomes almost deterministic , but non - ballistic , and the scaling is of brownian type .",
    "as we shall see , the proof gives in fact a more precise description of the behaviour of @xmath2 on this event of positive probability .",
    "let us immediately stress that the proof will in fact show that the results remain true if one replaces @xmath210 by any function @xmath215 of the type @xmath216 the facts that @xmath210 is a local version of the second derivative , that it is translation - invariant and that it is `` anti - symmetric '' are therefore not so crucial after all .",
    "in fact , our conclusion holds true if we replace @xmath210 by any local function @xmath217 such that    * for some @xmath218 , @xmath219 for all @xmath220 .",
    "* @xmath221 * @xmath222 and @xmath223 are both negative .",

    ", the occupation time density profile of the motion @xmath226 has a discontinuity at its local position ( i.e. at time @xmath227 , it is equal to @xmath228}$ ] ) , and the size of this jump is growing with time .",
    "hence , one could a priori naively expect that the walk would not slow down , but on the contrary speed up when this gap widens .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the self - interacting random walk therefore captures some feature of the discrete local time profile that is not visible in the continuous limit .",
    "the coming three subsections are devoted to the proof of proposition [ t2 ] .",
    "let us first describe in plain words a possible behaviour for our walk @xmath159 ( we shall then prove that indeed , this behaviour occurs with a positive probability ) : the walk @xmath159 starts at the origin , jumps to its right i.e. @xmath229 , and it forever remains positive i.e. @xmath230 for all positive times .",
    "in fact , when @xmath214 , @xmath36 goes off to @xmath231 . for each @xmath4 , denote @xmath232 the past maximum of the walk . in our scenario , @xmath233 for all @xmath23 . in other words , for each @xmath23 , either @xmath36 is equal to its past maximum @xmath234 , or it is equal to @xmath235 or @xmath236 .",
    "we see that we can therefore decompose the set of times as follows : define for each @xmath237 the hitting time @xmath238 of @xmath162 by @xmath159 , and let @xmath239 .",
    "then , in our scenario , during each of the intervals @xmath240 , the walk jumps back and forth on the edges between @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "when it stops doing so , it first jumps to @xmath243 , and then jumps back and forth on the edges between @xmath162 and @xmath243 and so on .",
    "imagine for a moment that this has happened for a while and that just before @xmath238 ( for a large @xmath162 ) i.e. when @xmath244 , the following loosely defined event @xmath245 is true : the walker has visited each of the edges @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 many times , and the number of times it has visited these three edges remain however comparable ( in the sense that the difference between these three numbers of visits is small ) . in particular , immediately before it chooses to jump to @xmath162 for the first time , the value of @xmath249 is rather close to zero ( mind that at that moment @xmath250 , and that @xmath251 because the walk has not visited @xmath162 yet ) so that the probability to indeed jump from @xmath241 to @xmath162 is therefore not too small",
    ".    then , the walk arrives at @xmath162 for the first time . at that moment , the two edges to its right have not yet been visited , the edge between @xmath162 and @xmath241 ( to its left ) has been visited only once ( because the walker arrives at @xmath162 for the first time ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the edge between @xmath241 and @xmath252 has been visited a lot of times .",
    "hence , the walk will ( very likely ) jump back to @xmath241 .",
    "once it is back at @xmath241 , the probability to jump to @xmath162 or to @xmath252 at that moment is neither very small nor very close to @xmath83 ( because the situation can not drastically change because of the two previous jumps ) . note that if the walk then jumps to @xmath252 , the value of @xmath210 will then be very small , so that the walk will want to jump immediately back to @xmath241 .",
    "hence , the walk is ( with high probability ) trapped between @xmath252 and @xmath162 for a while .",
    "how long does this happen ?",
    "well , one should note that each time the walk jumps on @xmath246 or on @xmath253 , it will increase the chance to jump to the right next time it is at @xmath241 .",
    "hence , after a short while , the walk will in fact only jump back and forth between @xmath241 and @xmath162 .",
    "this will be the case until the number of times at which it has jumped on @xmath253 starts to be comparable with the number of times at which it has jumped on @xmath254 , because the walk will then have a significant chance to move to @xmath243 .",
    "hence , we end up in a situation where @xmath255 holds .",
    "one important point in this scenario is that in the end , the walk will tend to jump a little more often on @xmath256 than on @xmath257 .",
    "so , by a law of large numbers type argument , the total number of visits of the edge @xmath257 will turn out to grow `` linearly '' in @xmath162 as @xmath258 .",
    "this will a posteriori justify our assumption ( in the definition of @xmath245 ) that at the time @xmath238 , the walk has visited @xmath246 and @xmath259 many times .",
    "we now start to turn the previous ideas into a rigorous proof .",
    "let us define a family of independent random variables @xmath260 , where @xmath261 , @xmath115 , @xmath12 .",
    "for each @xmath262 , @xmath107 and @xmath162 , the law of the random variable is the following : @xmath263 we can then define ( deterministically ) our random walk @xmath159 using this family of random variables as follows .",
    "let @xmath264 and for each @xmath4 , choose inductively @xmath265 where @xmath23 is the @xmath107-th time at which @xmath266 and @xmath267 .",
    "note that when @xmath268 , then @xmath269 is necessarily even ( because @xmath270 and @xmath271 are odd , while @xmath272 and @xmath273 are even ) .",
    "we will for the time being forget about this coupling between @xmath159 and the @xmath274 s , and just list a few simple observations concerning this family @xmath275 of random variables .",
    "a particular role will be played by the random variables @xmath276 when @xmath237 , @xmath277 and @xmath262 is an integer .",
    "we denote them by @xmath278 ( and drop the subscript @xmath107 ) .",
    "let us insist on the fact that @xmath278 are not defined for semi - integer @xmath262 s ( as opposed to the @xmath276 s ) .",
    "let us also keep in mind that for a given @xmath107 and @xmath162 , when @xmath262 is very large , the probability that @xmath279 and @xmath280 is very close to @xmath83 .",
    "we now define certain events :    * let @xmath281 denote the event that for all @xmath162 , all @xmath282 and all @xmath283 , @xmath284 * note that almost surely , for each @xmath162 , the number of positive ( respectively , negative ) @xmath262 s for which @xmath278 is positive ( respectively , negative ) is finite ( it follows immediately from the definition that it has a finite expectation ) .",
    "@xmath285 is the event that for all @xmath237 , @xmath286 * for all @xmath237 , let us define @xmath287 there is no problem with the definition of @xmath288 for the same reason as above .",
    "note that because of symmetry , @xmath289 .",
    "the law of large numbers therefore ensures that almost surely @xmath290 we define the event @xmath291 , that for all @xmath292 , @xmath293 $ ] .",
    "a simple application of the borel - cantelli lemma enables to prove that :    with positive probability , @xmath294 holds .",
    "the proof is elementary and safely left to the reader .      in order to simplify our notations",
    ", we will assume that at time zero , the initial profile is such that @xmath295 and that @xmath296 is zero otherwise .",
    "then , in our `` good scenario '' , the @xmath269 s will always remain even ( because @xmath270 and @xmath271 are both odd , whereas @xmath297 and @xmath273 are both even ) .",
    "this assumption is not a problem . if we start with @xmath296 being identically equal to @xmath91 , we let @xmath159 move twice to the right , and at this time @xmath298 , the situation is exactly the previous one .",
    "since we will prove asymptotic results about @xmath159 with positive probability , our theorem will follow immediately from the results with this particular initial profile .",
    "recall that our walk @xmath2 is defined deterministically from the @xmath276 s as follows : @xmath14 and for each @xmath4 , @xmath299 where @xmath300 , @xmath301 and @xmath107 is the cardinal of the set @xmath302 clearly , this definition ensures that one uses never the same @xmath276 twice , and that indeed @xmath303    we are going to assume that @xmath304 holds , and we will show that our `` good scenario '' holds as well . note that there is nothing probabilistic in the following arguments . for this , we will inductively prove that for each @xmath237 , certain events @xmath305 hold .",
    "define for each @xmath306 , the stopping time @xmath307 as the first time at which the edge @xmath253 has been crossed more than @xmath308 times and the walk is at @xmath241 .",
    "we say that the event @xmath305 holds if the following four conditions hold :    1 .",
    "the walk did not visit @xmath242 before @xmath309 .",
    "2 .   on @xmath310 $ ] , the walk did only visit the three sites @xmath311 and @xmath162 .",
    "3 .   the last @xmath312 jumps of the walk before @xmath309 were all on the edge between @xmath241 and @xmath162 .",
    "4 .   at the time @xmath313 , the two quantities @xmath314 and @xmath315 differ by not more than @xmath316 , and they are both larger than @xmath317 and smaller than @xmath318 .    , width=288 ]",
    "assume that @xmath319 , @xmath320 , and that @xmath321 do hold ( and that @xmath322 hold as well ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "let us first assume that @xmath323 are all equal to @xmath324 when @xmath325 and to @xmath130 when @xmath326 ( we will then later see what difference it makes if for finitely many values of @xmath262 this is not the case ) .",
    "because @xmath305 holds , it implies that at the ca . @xmath312 first times at which the walk has been at @xmath162 before time @xmath309 , the value of @xmath269 at those times was greater than @xmath327 ( because @xmath328 was small , @xmath329 was large and @xmath330 ) .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath269 at the time @xmath331 is very negative ( recall that @xmath332 , that at this time @xmath333 and @xmath334 are comparable , while @xmath335 is greater than @xmath308 and @xmath336 ) . hence , our assumption on the @xmath276 s ensures that @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 ( note that the @xmath107 used in those steps can not exceed the number of times one visited the sites ) .",
    "after these two steps , the value of @xmath269 ( when the walk is at @xmath241 ) has decreased by @xmath93 i.e. @xmath340 , whereas @xmath341 if @xmath342 . hence , we see that the walk will have to jump back and forth a number of times on the edge between @xmath241 and @xmath162 ; this will stop being the case because at some point , the walk will be at @xmath162 and will meet a @xmath276 that is equal to one .",
    "because before that , the @xmath210 s ( at the visiting times of @xmath162 ) have been decreasing , we see that this can only happen when one uses a @xmath277 i.e. when one uses @xmath343 ( this is the @xmath278 that is equal to one , for which @xmath262 is the largest ) .    from that moment ( call it @xmath344 ) onwards , the walk will start jumping back and forth on the edge between @xmath162 and @xmath242 ( this is because when it is at @xmath162 , it will use @xmath278 s for negative @xmath262 s , and when it is at @xmath242 , it will use @xmath345 for very large values of @xmath262 ) .",
    "this will happen until the time @xmath346 . at that time , @xmath347 i.e. the number of times at which the walk jumped on @xmath253 is equal to the number of times the walk jumped on @xmath348 , which ensures that in this very particular situation , @xmath349 indeed holds .    what is the difference due to those @xmath278 s that are equal to @xmath130 if @xmath350 or to @xmath324 if @xmath325 ?",
    "the first remark is that all these particular @xmath262 s will indeed be used in our process ( note that @xmath210 is decreasing two by two at each visit of @xmath162 , and that it starts from a very positive value and become very negative , and therefore has to use all @xmath278 s for @xmath351 $ ] .",
    "each time it meets a positive @xmath262 such that @xmath352 , it jumps to the right instead of jumping to the left . at the end of the day ( i.e. at @xmath353 ) this will mean that @xmath354 will be diminished by two .",
    "conversely , if it meets a non - negative @xmath262 such that @xmath355 , this will add @xmath93 to the number of jumps on @xmath356 .",
    "hence , we see that in our `` real '' case , @xmath357 and that @xmath349 will still hold because of our assumptions on the sum of the @xmath288 s .    as a consequence",
    ", we see that on the event @xmath322 of positive probability , all @xmath305 s hold .",
    "this implies in particular that for each @xmath162 , the walk will not come back to the site @xmath241 after @xmath358 i.e. that @xmath359 is in fact the total number of times the walk does jump on the edge @xmath253 .",
    "recall that @xmath360 and that almost surely , @xmath361 as @xmath362 , so that on our event of positive probability , @xmath363 .",
    "it follows that on our event of positive probability , @xmath364 so that @xmath365 ( recall that between @xmath366 and @xmath358 we know that @xmath36 is equal to @xmath241 , @xmath162 or @xmath242 ) and @xmath367 as @xmath214 .    this concludes the proof of proposition [ t2 ] .",
    "we now focus on an example that exhibits yet another possible asymptotic behaviour for the walk : @xmath368 where @xmath369 and we then choose @xmath54 as before .",
    "a naive first guess would be that this walk is self - attractive ( it is `` driven '' by the positive gradient of its local time ) and that it should get stuck .",
    "however :    [ p4 ] with positive probability , @xmath370 as @xmath214 .",
    "again , the proof shows that this behaviour is valid for a wider class of self - interactions .",
    "in fact , it is quite similar to the case ( with @xmath210 ) studied in the previous subsections .",
    "the main difference is that ( in the `` good '' scenario that we will describe ) the walk will visit approximatively twice more the edge @xmath371 than the edge @xmath6 for large @xmath6 .",
    "since the proof is otherwise almost identical to the previous case , we will only describe in plain words this `` scenario '' , and leave the details of the proof to the interested reader .",
    "suppose that for some particular large time @xmath372 :    * the walk is at its past maximum : @xmath373 .",
    "we call this site @xmath374 , and for all @xmath4 , we define @xmath375 , @xmath376 and @xmath377 to be the respective values of @xmath378 at @xmath379 , @xmath380 and @xmath381 . * the values of @xmath382 , @xmath383 and @xmath384 satisfy : @xmath385 \\hbox { and } w_0 \\in [ v_0 /2 , v_0 ] .\\ ] ]    we also suppose that the value of @xmath383 is very large . note that under these assumptions , it very likely that @xmath386 and @xmath387 , i.e. that the walk will jump back and forth along the edge @xmath381 between @xmath162 and @xmath241 , because @xmath388 is very large , while @xmath389 is negative and has a large absolute value .",
    "a quick analysis shows that ( with high probability ) the walk will jump back and forth on this edge until the negative drift at @xmath162 stops being huge , and the walk will then jump to @xmath242 for the first time .",
    "when this happens , this means that at this time , @xmath390 and @xmath377 are comparable",
    ". then , for some time , it will jump on the three sites @xmath241 , @xmath162 and @xmath242 , but while doing so , the drift at @xmath162 ( i.e. , that it feels when it is at @xmath162 ) grows fast , so that it will quickly be forced to jump along the edge between @xmath162 and @xmath242 only .",
    "we then let @xmath391 the first time @xmath23 at which @xmath392 is greater than @xmath393 and note that @xmath391 satisfies the same conditions as thos we required for @xmath372 .",
    "note also that once @xmath372 is found , the scenario is very likely to hold until @xmath391 when @xmath383 is large ( its conditional probability goes to @xmath83 very quickly with as @xmath383 gets larger ) . from this , it follows easily that with positive probability , the `` good scenario '' will indefinitely repeated .",
    "then , clearly the total number of visits to the edge @xmath394 grows like @xmath395 as @xmath362 , and the proposition follows .          to conclude ,",
    "let us finally mention without proof a much less surprising possible asymptotic behaviour , namely the ballistic one .",
    "the following pictures correspond to the trajectory and local time for the case where @xmath396 where @xmath397 that could seem at first glance to be again one of the walks driven ( like tsrw ) by the negative gradient of @xmath156 .",
    "this example , like many others in the present paper illustrates how sensitive the discrete model is to little shifts in the definition of the driving dynamics .",
    "let us conclude with a list of ( possibly accessible ) open problems related to the questions that we have just discussed :    1 .",
    "prove the @xmath398 scaling behaviour of the walk in the `` tsrm regime '' ( i.e. where @xmath94 and @xmath399 and the stationary distribution makes sense ) , or even the convergence to tsrm . or construct anote related markovian model ( for instance with another function @xmath15 ) where one can prove this ? 2 .",
    "describe in some detail the `` actual '' ( i.e. , the one that actually dominates ) trapping strategy in the `` trapped case '' @xmath92 and @xmath400 .",
    "get some ( even partial ) description of the dynamics in the `` slow phase . ''",
    "does the qualitative behaviour depend only on @xmath401 ? 4 .   in the case where the walk goes deterministically to infinity ,",
    "are other scaling behaviours than @xmath402 , @xmath403 and @xmath404 possible ? 5 .   improve some of the results to almost sure statements ( instead of `` with positive probability '' ) .",
    "is it possible that for some choice of the parameters in such self - interacting random walks with finite range , the qualitative asymptotic behaviour is actually not almost sure ( i.e. can two different behaviours that exist with positive probability exist ? ) .",
    "do qualitatively really new asymptotic behaviours arise when one considers larger ( but finite ) self - interaction ranges",
