    "helium clusters have been the object of a rather extensive investigation in the last two decades .",
    "they are becoming even more interesting nowadays , due to the improved accuracy of recent experiments where several properties of the clusters are characterized by using dopant atoms and molecules as efficient probes @xcite . in 1995 ,",
    "the observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in ultracold vapors of alkali - metal atoms @xcite opened another active field of research .",
    "this event is seemingly disconnected from the physics of helium clusters .",
    "the framework in which bec was initially investigated is a mix of atomic physics and quantum optics , while helium clusters are a typical subject of condensed matter and chemical physics . as a consequence ,",
    "some of the key words used to interpret the first experimental results on bec ( like order parameter , coherence length , phase coherence , elementary excitations , and others ) had sometimes different meaning in the two communities . however , as soon as trapped condensates were sufficiently characterized , by using the gross - pitaevskii theory as a starting point , most of the physics behind these systems appeared to be strongly connected with the physics of superfluids .",
    "one can even say that helium droplets and trapped atomic gases correspond to two limiting cases of the same system since they are , respectively , examples of very dense and dilute finite - sized quantum fluids . despite the different type of confinement ( self - binding for helium droplets and external trapping for atomic gases ) these systems belong to the same conceptual framework , possibly based on a common language .    a quantum fluid is a system of many interacting particles for which one can locally define both a density and a velocity field , whose behavior is strongly affected by quantum correlations .",
    "an example of these quantum effects is the zero point motion , which is crucial in determining the typical lengthscales for density modulations , like the surface thickness at the fluid boundaries , the core size of a vortex , the size of soliton - like structures .",
    "another important effect is the fact that the fluid , or part of it , moves with a non - dissipative and irrotational velocity field , which means that the system is superfluid . these and other features can be associated with the existence of an _",
    "order parameter_. qualitatively , as the particles are cooled down to enough low temperatures their de broglie wavelength becomes larger than their average separation , so that they loose their individual identity . in the case of bosons ,",
    "they can be treated as components of a single  macroscopic wave function \" .",
    "the concept of order parameter is the appropriate tool to implement this qualitative idea .",
    "the temperature at which these effects occur is generally very low , so that the fluid actually freezes before reaching this regime . in the case of liquid @xmath0he",
    ", the light atomic mass allows the system to remain liquid down to zero temperature and the system becomes a quantum fluid for temperatures lower than about @xmath1 k. in the case of trapped condensates , vapors of alkali - metal atoms are kept in a metastable gas - phase down to temperatures of the order of tens of nanokelvin , where quantum effects becomes dominant .",
    "the fact that these systems are in a metastable configuration is compatible with the existence of a kinetic equilibrium which is ensured by two - body elastic collisions .",
    "the transition to the thermodynamic equilibrium , given by the crystal phase , is instead driven by three - body recombinations , which are however rare events in very dilute samples and take place on a relatively long time scale .",
    "when the fluid becomes a quantum fluid the type of quantum statistics is also crucial and one can find either a fermi or a bose fluid with very different properties .",
    "liquid @xmath2he is the fermionic counterpart of @xmath0he , and also alkali - metal atoms with both fermi and bose statistics can be trapped and cooled down to the quantum regime . in this brief review , however , we concentrate mainly on bose fluids .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we remind the basic notions of bose - einstein condensation , as a common starting point .",
    "then we discuss two opposite limits : a dilute and cold gas , where one can develop a rigorous theory for interacting bosons , and a dense quantum fluid , where more sophisticated many - body techniques are required .",
    "once the theoretical framework is sketched , we finally describe some predicted and/or observed properties of both helium droplets and trapped condensates ( critical temperature , ground state , excitations , superfluid effects , etc . ) in order to emphasize relevant analogies and differences .",
    "the intimate link between helium droplets and trapped condensates is the occurrence of bose - einstein condensation and the fact that this phenomenon plays a key role in determining most of the properties of both systems .    in the case of noninteracting particles ,",
    "bose - einstein condensation has well established features . the system can be represented by a set of single - particle states of energy @xmath3 , each one occupied by a certain number of particles @xmath4 . at a given temperature @xmath5 ,",
    "the average occupation numbers are fixed by bose statistics , resulting in the well known law @xmath6 \\ } $ ] , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the chemical potential .",
    "the latter is fixed by the conditions that the total number of particles , @xmath9 , is equal to the sum @xmath10 .",
    "for relatively high @xmath5 one finds that this condition is satisfied for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy of the lowest single - particle state , and the particles are thermally distributed over many states , all of them having @xmath13 of the order of @xmath14 ( or , equivalently , much less than @xmath9 ) .",
    "however , there is no exclusion principle for bosons : many of them can stay in the same state .",
    "this happens when the temperature is lowered ; when the chemical potential approaches @xmath12 , the occupation of the lowest state becomes a macroscopic number @xmath15 of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "this phenomenon is called bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the critical temperature at which it occurs can be calculated starting from the knowledge of the single - particle hamiltonian and keeping the appropriate thermodynamic limit @xmath16 .",
    "in the textbook case of a uniform system of free bosons of mass @xmath17 , one increases the volume @xmath18 while keeping the density @xmath19 constant ; in this way , one gets the critical temperature @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the riemann zeta function and @xmath22 .",
    "this result can be rewritten as @xmath23 , where @xmath24^{1/2}$ ] is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "this is a quantitative translation of the qualitative idea mentioned in the introduction : quantum effects become crucial when the de broglie wavelength becomes larger than the average separation between particles .",
    "the same calculations also yields the condensate fraction @xmath25 . at @xmath26",
    "all particles are in the @xmath27 state , that is , the system is fully condensed .",
    "this state has a uniform density and is characterized by having zero momentum ; for this reason , one often speaks of condensation in momentum space .",
    "it is important to stress here that , when applied to liquid @xmath0he ( @xmath17 and @xmath28 being the atomic mass and the liquid density , respectively ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tc1 ] ) gives a transition temperature reasonably close to @xmath29 , i.e. , the temperature at which helium becomes superfluid .",
    "this very simple and striking result marked the beginning of the theory of superfluids , starting from the pioneering work of fritz london @xcite .",
    "in the case of @xmath9 bosons confined in a spherical harmonic potential @xmath30 , the proper thermodynamic limit is obtained by letting @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while keeping the product @xmath33 constant . in this way the critical temperature is well defined ; one finds @xcite @xmath34 and the condensate fraction is @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the different @xmath5-dependence exhibited by the condensate fraction compared to the uniform case is the consequence of the higher density of states characterizing the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian . at @xmath26",
    "all particles are in the lowest eigenstate of the harmonic oscillator , namely , @xmath36 .",
    "thus the particle density has the form of a gaussian and the same is true for the momentum distribution . differently from the uniform gas",
    ", condensation occurs in both real and momentum space . actually , the occurrence of a sharp peak in the velocity distribution of a cloud of @xmath37rb atoms , released from a magnetic trap , was the first evidence of bose - einstein condensations in these cold gases @xcite , and the transition temperature was found to be very close to the value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcho ] ) .    since both liquid @xmath0he and dilute atomic gases are systems of interacting particles , a crucial question concerns the role played by the interaction , that is , whether and how much the interatomic forces modify the properties of bose - einstein condensation . understanding the interplay between quantum statistical and dynamic effects represents the challenging task to achieve both experimentally and theoretically in these quantum many - body systems .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath9 particles interacting _ via _ a potential @xmath38 and , possibly , with an external field @xmath39 . in principle",
    ", one should solve the exact many - body schrdinger equation or , equivalently , find the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath40 \\hat\\psi ( { \\bf r } )   +   { 1\\over 2 } \\int \\ !",

    "this is a difficult task and we do not discuss here the possible strategies . we only want to emphasize the meaning of bose - einstein condensation in terms of a generic solution of the many - body problem . an elegant way @xcite consists in writing the one - body density matrix , which is defined as @xmath44 where the average is taken in the state that one wants to describe .",
    "this quantity characterizes the correlations between particles located in different points in space .",
    "one can use a complete set of single particle states to explicitly write @xmath45 as a matrix",
    ". then one can diagonalize it , finding eigenstates and eigenvalues .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as the occupation numbers associated with each eigenstate . in analogy with the ideal bose gas",
    ", one might expect that below some critical temperature one of these eigenvalues , instead of being of order @xmath14 as all the others , is a number @xmath46 of the order of @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstate then has a special role in the system , since it is macroscopically occupied .",
    "when an interacting system exhibits such a behavior , one says that it is bose - einstein condensed .    in the case of a uniform system ,",
    "the appropriate basis is a set of plane waves , eigenstates of the momentum @xmath47 . if @xmath46 is the number of particles condensed into the lowest energy @xmath48 state , then the density matrix can be written in the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "this summation is made over all states except @xmath48 ; for @xmath51 it simply gives the total number of particles with @xmath52 , that is @xmath53 . in the opposite limit , @xmath54 , due to destructive interference between the various phase factors , the function @xmath55 vanishes , while the condensed part of the density matrix remains everywhere constant .",
    "this infinite range of the the density matrix ( off - diagonal long range order ) is also called first order coherence .",
    "it is a key consequence of bose statistics and is the origin of the quantum correlations that are responsible for superfluidity .",
    "this is the basic physics behind the superfluid behavior of liquid @xmath0he below @xmath29 . in such a dense system ,",
    "the effect of the interaction , which is implicitly included in eq .  ( [ eq : rho - uniform ] ) , is very important .",
    "compared to the ideal gas , it changes the features of the phase transition and gives a large depletion of the condensate , @xmath56 being of the order of @xmath57% even at @xmath26 .",
    "this description can be easily generalized to nonuniform systems . in this case , the contribution to @xmath45 associated with the condensed state is no more a number , but depends on positions .",
    "the straightforward generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho - uniform ] ) is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is of order @xmath9 , while @xmath60 vanishes for large @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to say that the bosonic field operator splits in two parts @xmath62 where the first term is a complex function associated with the macroscopic occupation of the condensate and the second one is the field operator associated with the noncondensed particles .",
    "the complex function can be defined as the expectation value of the field operator : @xmath63 it behaves as a classical field having the meaning of an order parameter , and is often named _ macroscopic wave function_. its modulus gives the condensate density through @xmath64 , while the phase @xmath65 can be used to define a velocity field through @xmath66 .",
    "similarly to the case of uniform gases , the fact that the order parameter has a well - defined phase corresponds to assuming the occurrence of a broken gauge symmetry in the many - body system .",
    "it is worth noticing that , strictly speaking , in a finite - sized system neither the concept of broken gauge symmetry , nor the one of off - diagonal long - range order can be applied .",
    "in fact , the density matrix ( [ eq : rho - nonuniform ] ) vanishes for distances of the order of the size of the system so that , in order to make the separation of the condensate and noncondensate components physically meaningful , it is crucial that the lengthscale at which @xmath67 vanishes be much smaller than the size of the system .",
    "the condensate wave function @xmath68 can nevertheless be always calculated as the eigenfunction of the density matrix with the largest eigenvalue .",
    "a numerical diagonalization of the density matrix was performed , for example , by lewart _",
    "@xcite in order to estimate the condensate density , @xmath69 , in helium droplets with up to @xmath70 atoms , using a variational monte carlo approach .",
    "the decomposition of the field operator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition ] ) is particularly useful when the depletion of the condensate , i.e. , the fraction of noncondensed particles , is very small .",
    "this happens when the interaction is weak , but also for particles with arbitrary interaction , provided the gas is dilute . in this case",
    ", one can expand the hamiltonian ( [ eq : manybodyhamiltonian ] ) by treating @xmath71 as a small quantity .    in a uniform gas the condensate wave function , @xmath68 ,",
    "is just a constant and expanding @xmath72 to the lowest order in @xmath71 gives access to the equations for the excited states .",
    "this procedure was introduced by bogoliubov @xcite , who found an elegant way to diagonalize the hamiltonian by using simple linear combinations of particle creation and annihilation operators .",
    "these are known as bogoliubov s transformations and stay at the basis of the concept of _ quasiparticle _ , which is one of the most important concepts in quantum many - body theory .",
    "if the gas is nonuniform , the theory has to include an equation for the spatial variation of the condensate , even at the zeroth - order in @xmath71 .",
    "a possible strategy consists in writing the heisenberg equation for the evolution of the field operators , using the hamiltonian ( [ eq : manybodyhamiltonian ] ) : @xmath73   =   \\left ( -\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla ^2}{2 m } + v_{\\rm ext}({\\bf r } )   + \\int d{\\bf r } ' \\ \\hat \\psi ^{\\dagger}({\\bf r}',t ) v({\\bf r}'-{\\bf r } ) \\hat \\psi ( { \\bf r}',t ) \\right ) \\hat \\psi ( { \\bf r},t ) \\ ; . \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] then the lowest order is obtained by replacing the operator @xmath74 with the classical field @xmath68 . in the integral containing the atom - atom interaction @xmath75",
    ", this replacement is , in general , a poor approximation when short distances @xmath76 are involved . in a dilute and cold gas ,",
    "one can nevertheless obtain a proper expression for the interaction term by observing that , in this case , only binary collisions at low energy are relevant and these collisions are characterized by a single parameter , the @xmath77-wave scattering length , independently of the details of the two - body potential .",
    "this allows one to replace @xmath75 in ( [ eq : h ] ) with an effective interaction @xmath78 where the coupling constant @xmath79 is related to the scattering length @xmath80 through @xmath81 . using this pseudo - potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) and replacing @xmath74 with @xmath68 , one gets the following closed equation for the order parameter : @xmath82 this is known as gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite .",
    "it has been derived assuming that @xmath9 is large while the fraction of noncondensed atoms is small . on the one hand",
    ", this means that quantum fluctuations of the field operator have to be small , which is true when @xmath83 , where @xmath28 is the particle density .",
    "in fact , one can show that , at @xmath26 the depletion of the condensate is proportional to @xmath84 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal fluctuations have also to be negligible and this means that the theory is limited to temperatures much lower than @xmath85 . within these limits",

    ", one can simplify the problem by using a purely hydrodynamic approach , in which the equations of motions for the velocity field are the ones of an irrotational and viscousless fluid , but with the density taken from the minimization of the density functional ( [ eq : ec ] ) .",

    "@xcite to predict the moment of inertia of doped helium droplets .",
    "in typical experiments the temperature of @xmath0he droplets is about @xmath136 k @xcite , as the result of a spontaneous evaporation of the warmest atoms after the formation of droplets in the free jet expansion of helium @xcite .",
    "this temperature is well below the bulk superfluid transition temperature , @xmath137 k. path integral monte carlo calculations @xcite have shown that even small droplets , with few tens of atoms , are superfluid at this temperature .",
    "moreover , the droplet is cold enough to neglect the thermal activation of excited states .",
    "the lowest ones are discretized collective modes ( bulk and surface oscillations ) which are not significantly populated at @xmath138 k. thus , for most purposes , helium droplets can be considered as @xmath26 systems .",

    "again this is the result of evaporation , but here the evaporative cooling process is induced and controlled through an external rf - field which acts on the shape of the confining potential , lowering the edge of the trap and letting the hottest atoms to escape .",
    "this cooling process can be continued until most of the thermally excited atoms are removed and , hence , the system can be considered as a condensate at @xmath26 . differently from helium droplets , the properties of trapped gases",
    "can also be studied as a function of @xmath5 , just stopping the evaporative cooling at the desired temperature . in this case",
    ", the gas has two components , a condensate and a thermal cloud , and the gross - pitaevskii theory of section [ sec : dilute ] has to be generalized to properly include the thermal component . in the following , however , we restrict the analysis to @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "let us consider a typical helium cluster of @xmath139-@xmath140 atoms . in its ground state ,",
    "it is a self - bound liquid droplet with a rather flat density distribution , the central density being close to the one of the uniform liquid in the limit of zero pressure , i.e. , @xmath141 @xmath124 ( see fig.1 ) . assuming the droplet to have constant density and sharp surface",
    ", its radius would be @xmath142 with @xmath143  , which gives about @xmath144 to @xmath145  , significantly larger than the average atomic distance . actually , the true density profile has a rather smooth surface due to the large zero point motion of the atoms .",
    "the density decreases from the bulk value to zero within about twice the average atomic distance , i.e. , about 6 to 9 depending on the precise definition of the surface thickness ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the thickness of the surface region is comparable to the droplet radius for @xmath9 of the order of @xmath146 or less , but even for larger droplets the diffuseness of the surface can play a significant role .",
    "for instance , it makes the average density of the droplet lower than the bulk liquid value and hence the atoms are less bound to the droplet than to the uniform liquid .",
    "as already said , one can reasonably use the liquid drop model to express the energy per particle as a function of @xmath9 : @xmath147 where @xmath148 k is the volume coefficient , i.e. the energy per particle in the bulk liquid ( in the limit of zero temperature and zero pressure ) , and the next terms are surface and curvature energies .",
    "this type of formulae are frequently used to fit the numerical results of ground state calculations .",
    "the density distribution of a pure helium droplet is determined by the balance of the kinetic energy , associated with the zero - point motion of the atoms , and the potential energy due to atom - atom interaction .",
    "one can also produce density modulations in the droplets by picking up a foreign atom or molecule , acting as an external potential in which helium atoms readapt .",
    "this is , however , a local effect , in the sense that the main changes in the density distribution are limited to the first layers of atoms around the impurity .    differently from helium droplets ,",
    "trapped condensates are not self - bound .",
    "they are produced and maintained in an external confining harmonic potential , of the form @xmath149 @xcite . if this potential is switched - off , the condensate freely expands .",
    "the density distribution of a trapped gas is determined by the balance of three energy contributions given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : funcofdensity ] ) .",
    "since the sign of the interaction energy is fixed by the scattering length @xmath80 , one may have either a repulsive or attractive mean - field potential , for positive and negative @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "the case of negative @xmath80 is very interesting for several reasons but it is not suitable for a comparison with helium .",
    "in fact , a uniform gas of atoms with negative @xmath80 is unstable ; it has negative pressure and it lowers its energy by collapsing into separate regions of high density . in a trap , quantum pressure can prevent this collapse , at least below some critical density @xcite , but such metastable condensates have no counterpart in the uniform limit , differently from the case of liquid helium and of trapped condensates with positive @xmath80 .",
    "if the atoms were not interacting ( @xmath150 ) the condensate would have the form of the lowest single - particle state in the harmonic potential , i.e , a gaussian having a width @xmath151^{1/2}$ ] . in actual condensates , with @xmath152 , the repulsion between atoms tends to lower the central density , thus increasing the condensate width .",
    "the equilibrium configuration is again fixed by the balance between @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath156 ( thomas - fermi limit ) the density in the central part is so smooth that the quantum pressure is negligible compared to both @xmath154 and @xmath155 . in this case , the gp equation ( [ eq : gp ] ) simply gives @xmath157 $ ] , that is , a density having the form of an inverted parabola . in the same limit",
    ", one can easily calculate the energy per particle , @xmath158 which contains both the harmonic potential parameters and the scattering length . only in a narrow region at the surface , where the density vanishes ,",
    "the interaction term becomes small and the density profile is determined by the balance between quantum pressure and external potential @xcite ; it deviates from the inverted parabola and goes smoothly to zero .",
    "this surface region gives a logarithmic correction to the thomas - fermi energy ( [ eq : energytf ] ) , of the form @xmath159 .",
    "an example is shown in fig.1 , where one can see how the external potential affect the overall shape of the condensate ( right panel ) , in contrast with the self - bound helium droplet ( left panel ) .    at present ,",
    "several types of condensates are available in different labs ( different geometries and atomic species ) .",
    "let us consider a common situation of a condensate made by @xmath160-@xmath161 atoms of sodium or rubidium , in a trap with @xmath162-@xmath146 hz .",
    "the width of the condensate can be several @xmath8 m , but wider condensates , up to @xmath163 m , have been obtained in anisotropic traps .",
    "the scattering length @xmath80 is of the order of a few nm and the ratio @xmath164 is about @xmath165 , so that @xmath166 ; thus the density profile is very well represented by an inverted parabola with a thin surface region .",

    "the central density is of the order of @xmath168-@xmath169 cm@xmath124 , so that @xmath117 is less than @xmath165 , which ensures the applicability of gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "the relevant lengthscales are summarized in table i for a @xmath0he droplet with @xmath140 atoms and a trapped condensate of @xmath160 atoms of @xmath37rb .",
    "one notes that the only difference in @xmath135 , @xmath171 and @xmath125 is a common rescaling , from nm ( helium ) to @xmath8 m ( trapped bec ) .",
    "this is not true for @xmath80 , which is of the same order of @xmath135 in the dense fluid and much smaller than @xmath135 in the dilute gas .",
    "a direct consequence of the very different values of @xmath117 for the two systems in fig.1 is that the total density plotted in the right panel can be also identified with the condensate density , since quantum depletion is negligible ( less than @xmath14% ) , while the same is not true for helium . in the latter case ,",
    "the condensate density is expected to be about @xmath57% of the total density in the inner part of the droplet , increasing to a maximum value at the surface where the system is more dilute @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "a peculiar feature of bose superfluids is that their excitations at low energy correspond to collective modes , which can be described as fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "this happens when their wavelength is larger than the healing length .    for uniform and dilute gases ,",
    "the spectrum of excitations is given by the bogoliubov result ( [ eq : bogoliubovspectrum ] ) , which is phononic at low @xmath172 and single - particle at high @xmath172 .",
    "low @xmath172 excitations are phonons even in liquid helium , with sound velocity @xmath173 m / s . however , since the fluid is dense and highly correlated , the interpolation between the phononic and single - particle regimes is more subtle .",
    "the phonon branch reaches a maximum at @xmath174@xmath175 and then forms a rather deep minimum at @xmath176@xmath175 , with energy @xmath177 k. the excitations near this minimum , whose dispersion is approximately parabolic , are called rotons .",
    "their wavelength is of the order of the interatomic distances and slightly larger than the healing length , so that they still have collective character , but are related , roughly speaking , to a tendency to local order on the atomic scale .",
    "helium droplets and trapped bec have a finite radius @xmath125 . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum is discrete and the excited states have to be classified according to the number of radial nodes , @xmath178 , and the angular momentum quanta ( @xmath179 and @xmath17 , if the system is spherical ) .",
    "the discretization is particularly important for the lowest energy excitations , whose wavelength is comparable with @xmath125 , and correspond to oscillations of the whole system .",
    "an example of collective mode is the state with @xmath180 and @xmath181 , which is a purely compressional oscillation ( monopole , or _ breathing _",
    "mode ) . by keeping @xmath181 and increasing @xmath178 ,",
    "one finds density oscillations in the radial direction having wavelength smaller than @xmath125 . if @xmath178 is large , so that the wavelength becomes much smaller than @xmath125 but still larger than @xmath171 ( see table i ) , these modes can be thought as stationary states of bulk excitations ( phonons and/or rotons ) which propagate radially and reflect at the surface . for large @xmath125 ,",
    "these discretized states approach a continuum and the spectrum becomes closer and closer to the one of a uniform system , namely , the phononic bogoliubov dispersion in dilute gas and the phonon - roton branch in liquid helium .    another interesting class of excitations is the one with @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "these modes correspond to shape oscillations , or surface excitations , because the motion is mainly concentrated near the surface , the latter being displaced in and out periodically .",
    "the lowest one is the quadrupole deformation , @xmath184 . by increasing @xmath179",
    "one gets shape oscillations with more nodes in the angular direction , that is , surface waves with shorter wavelength . in the absence of external confinement as in helium droplets , and for large @xmath125 , these states approach the collective waves of the liquid - vapour interface ( ripplons ) , having dispersion @xmath185 , where @xmath186 is the surface energy and @xmath172 is the wavevector parallel to the surface . in the case of trapped gases the dispersion is instead given by the law @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the trapping harmonic force calculated at @xmath189 @xcite .    how can these collective states be excited and observed ? in trapped condensate the answer is simple : one can modulate the external potential in order to force oscillations in the system in a classical way . with this method ,",
    "one has already observed monopole , dipole , quadrupole modes , as well as higher multipolarities @xcite .",
    "their frequency is measured with great accuracy and the agreement with theory is very good .",
    "the theoretical work basically corresponds to the numerical solution of the bogoliubov - like equations ( [ eq : coupled1])-([eq : coupled2 ] ) . in the thomas - fermi limit , @xmath166",
    ", one can also obtain analytic results by linearizing the hydrodynamic equations ( [ eq : continuity])-([eq : euler ] ) @xcite .",
    "in spherical traps one obtains the dispersion relation @xmath190 , which can be compared with the spectrum of noninteracting particles in the same harmonic potential , @xmath191 @xcite .    phonon - like excitations with wavelength smaller than the condensate size can also be produced .",
    "for instance , one can suddenly switch - on a narrow laser beam , focused in the center of the trap .",
    "an optical dipole force acts on the atoms generating a wavepacket of excitations which then moves throughout the condensate as a sound wave .",
    "the velocity of this sound wave has been measured in @xcite , finding good agreement with the prediction of bogoliubov theory .",
    "phonon - like excitations have been also generated in light - scattering experiments @xcite .    driving collective excitations in helium droplets , in a controllable way ,",
    "is much less simple , since there is no confining potential to play with .",
    "however , one can produce and probe excitations by picking up impurities .",
    "a foreign atom or molecule , laying inside the droplet or at the surface , can be excited with a laser and this excitation may couple to the internal degrees of freedom of the droplet .",
    "this mechanism is at the basis of the so - called depletion method : a photon absorbed by an embedded impurity causes a transfer of energy from the impurity to the droplet _ via _ the creation of excitations .",
    "the latter eventually exchange their energy with atoms at the surface , letting them to evaporate through a quantum evaporation process .",
    "thus , by monitoring the droplet beam with a mass spectrometer , one detects the spectroscopic transitions of the impurity which , in turn , contain information about the droplet itself @xcite .",
    "this process has some interesting analogies with the quantum evaporation experiments in bulk helium @xcite , where the initial bunch of excitations ( phonons and/or rotons ) is produced by a heater immersed in the liquid , while the evaporated atoms are collected at a bolometer above the surface .",
    "there are also significant analogies with the sound propagation experiment in a trapped condensate @xcite , where the `` heater '' is represented by the laser beam . in this case , if the trap is kept on , phonons do not evaporate atoms , but they may exchange energy with single - particle states in the outer part of the condensate .",
    "an example of how the superfluid environment affects the spectrum of embedded impurities is the observation of the phonon wing in the electronic excitation spectrum of a glyoxal ( c@xmath192h@xmath192o@xmath192 ) molecule in helium droplets with about @xmath193 atoms @xcite .",
    "the observed features were found to be consistent with the existence of a phonon - roton spectrum of excitations inside the liquid droplet , with no low - lying single - particle excitations , as expected for a bose superfluid .",
    "theoretical calculations have also shown that , for droplets of this size , the discretized spectrum of collective excitations closely resembles the continuum of phonons and rotons of bulk liquid @xcite .",
    "not all impurities are bound inside helium droplets ; some prefer to stay at the surface . in this case",
    ", they can be sensitive to surface modes . for large droplets ,",
    "theoretical calculations show that the spectrum of these excitations , with @xmath194 , is close to the one of collective waves on a planar helium - vacuum interface ( ripplons ) @xcite .",
    "this also ensures that the liquid drop model ( ldm ) is accurate enough for many purposes .",
    "for example , using the liquid drop model for the excited states , together with a statistical method for the evaporation rate , the typical temperature of helium clusters in a supersonic beam was calculated in ref .",
    "the predicted values , for both @xmath2he and @xmath0he droplets , were later found to agree with experiments @xcite , so providing an indirect insight into the spectrum of surface excitations .",
    "the fact that in a uniform superfluid system single - particle excitations are not allowed to exist below the low - energy collective modes is at the basis of the well known",
    " landau criterion \" .",
    "this says that , in order to create excitations in a superfluid by moving an impurity , one has to overcome some critical velocity , which is fixed by the spectrum of the excited states of the system .",

    "this is a fundamental feature characterizing the superfluid motion , which applies to both liquid helium and dilute condensates . in this connection ,",

    "trapped condensates , however , the direct measurement of @xmath204 is not feasible and , consequently , the determination of @xmath208 requires more subtle probes .    a suitable solution for trapped condensates is provided by the fact that , if the trap is deformed , the quadrupole and rotational degrees of freedom",

    "a vortex line is not stable since its formation costs a large amount of kinetic energy of the superfluid flow , and the ground state of the droplets is hence always vortex - free @xcite . on the one hand , however , if a vortex appears as a metastable state in some dynamical process , then one has to consider also the conservation of both energy and angular momentum in any possible decay mechanism , and one might discover that this state is indeed long - living , despite its large energy , as it has been shown for vortex configurations in trapped condensates . on the other hand , one can use dopant atoms or molecules to pin and stabilize the vortex , as the density functional calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite suggest . in this case",
    ", the dopant can be used also as a probe of vorticity , through the possible effects of the vortex flow on its rotational spectrum . an interesting perspective in this direction",
    "is the possibility to accommodate in the droplet a long chain of linear molecules , such as hcn , as done in ref .  @xcite .",
    "such chains are expected to be suitable for the stabilization of a vortex line and , moreover , they can reveal in their spectrum the presence of the vortex flow , like for a vibrating wire in a nanoscale vinen - like experiment .",
    "in this paper we reviewed some properties of both helium nanodroplets and dilute trapped condensates .",
    "our purpose was not to give a systematic and detailed account of the available theories and experiments , but rather to discuss some relevant features which allow one to build a bridge between the two systems .",
    "we emphasized the existence of a common theoretical background and of many analogies in the measured properties , as well as of several interesting differences .",
    "we mainly used the language of gross - pitaevskii and density functional theory because , on the one hand , it represents a very reliable mean - field approach for dilute gases and , on the other hand , density functional approaches has been successfully used also in helium droplets .",
    "of course , the close connections between trapped dilute gases and helium droplets would equally emerge when examined from the viewpoint of more _ microscopic _ theories or stochastic monte carlo techniques .",
    "once this bridge is established , one may include most of the recent advances in both fields within a unified perspective , namely , the road towards a deeper understanding of the physics of interacting quantum fluids .",
