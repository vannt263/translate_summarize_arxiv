    "the flux of atmospheric neutrinos and muons at very high energies , above @xmath1 , originates primarily from semileptonic decays of charmed particles instead of pions and kaons , which are the dominant decay modes at lower energies ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "this flux is one of the most important backgrounds for `` neutrino telescopes '' , limiting their sensitivity to astrophysical signals , especially for future @xmath2 detectors which might be able to observe neutrinos and muons at extremely high energies , even up to @xmath3 gev .",
    "we use perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , the theoretically preferred model , to compute the charm production .",
    "we perform a true next - to - leading order ( nlo ) pqcd analysis of the production of charmed particles in the atmosphere , together with a full simulation of the particle cascades down to the final muons and neutrinos .",
    "this is done by combining the nlo pqcd calculations of charm production and computer routines of mangano , nason , and ridolfi @xcite ( called mnr in the following ) with the computer simulations of the cascades generated by pythia @xcite .",
    "these are the same programs currently used to compare pqcd predictions with experimental data in accelerator experiments .",
    "we have already presented results of our calculations in a previous paper @xcite ( called ggv1 from now on ) , in which all the details of the program we use can be found .",
    "the main goal of our first paper was to compare the fluxes obtained with the nlo and the leading order ( lo ) calculations , i.e. we computed the @xmath4 factor for the neutrino and muon fluxes .",
    "this was done to improve on the first study of atmospheric fluxes based on pqcd , performed by thunman , ingelman , and gondolo a few years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite ( called tig in the following ) .",
    "tig used the lo charm production cross section computed by pythia , multiplied by a constant @xmath4 factor of 2 to bring it in line with the nlo values , and supplemented by parton shower evolution and hadronization according to the lund model .",
    "in ggv1 we found the @xmath4 factors for different parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) , as function of energy , to be in a range between 2.1 and 2.5 .",
    "a similar analysis was recently made in pasquali , reno , and sarcevic @xcite ( called prs from now on ) , with results compatible with ours , using a treatment of the problem complementary to ours .",
    "in fact , prs used approximate analytic solutions to the cascade equations in the atmosphere , also introduced by tig , while we make instead a full simulation of the cascades .",
    "in ggv1 we showed that the approach used by tig ( i.e. multiplying the lo fluxes by an overall @xmath4 factor of 2 ) was essentially correct , except for their relative low @xmath4 factor ( since @xmath4 values of 2.2 - 2.4 , depending slightly on the pdf , provide estimates of the nlo within about 10% ) .",
    "however , while tig found neutrino and muon fluxes lower than the lowest previous estimate , we found instead larger fluxes ( by factors of 3 to 10 at the highest energies , about @xmath5 gev ) , in the bulk part of previous predictions .",
    "the main reason for this difference is studied in this paper .    here",
    "we explore the dependence of the atmospheric fluxes on the extrapolation of the gluon pdf at very small partonic momentum fraction @xmath0 , @xmath6 , which is crucial for the fluxes at high energies . as explained below",
    ", the relevant momentum fraction @xmath0 of the interacting atmospheric parton is of the order of the inverse of the leptonic energy @xmath7 ( in the atmospheric rest frame ) in gev .",
    "this energy , in turn , is of the order of 0.1 @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the energy per nucleon of the incoming cosmic ray in the lab .",
    "frame ( the atmospheric rest frame ) .",
    "thus , for @xmath9 gev , we need the pdf s at @xmath10 , values of @xmath0 which are not reached experimentally .",
    "the final fluxes depend mostly on the gluon pdf , since this is by far the dominant one at these small @xmath0 values and charm is mostly produced through gluon - gluon fusion processes .    a concern that has been expressed to us several times is the applicability of the mnr nlo - pqcd calculations , mostly done for accelerator physics , to the different kinematic domain of cosmic rays . in response",
    "we remark that , for the less steep extrapolations of the gluon structure function @xmath11 that we use at small @xmath0 , we have large logarithms , known as ",
    "ln(1/x ) \" terms , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the hadronic center of mass squared energy and this @xmath0 is the average value of the hadron energy fraction needed to produce the @xmath14 pair . with the extrapolation",
    "@xmath15 ( see below ) and @xmath16 close to 0.5 , and possibly for the intermediate choices of @xmath16 also , there should be no large logarithm .",
    "the problem arises for @xmath16 too close to zero . we will attempt to deal with this problem in future work . moreover ,",
    "contrary to the case in accelerators , we do not have the uncertainty present in the differential cross sections @xcite when @xmath17 is much larger than @xmath18 , due to the presence of large logarithms of @xmath19 . because we do not have here a forward cut in acceptance ,",
    "the characteristic transverse charm momentum in our simulations is of the order of the charm mass , @xmath20 .    in this paper , as in ggv1 , the mnr program is used to compute the inclusive charm cross section and the cascades simulated by pythia are initiated by a single @xmath21 quark .",
    "this is the ` single ' mode described in our previous paper ggv1 , where we argued its advantages .",
    "we explained there our normalization of the nlo charm production cross sections in the mnr program , and described in detail the computer simulations used to calculate the neutrino and muon fluxes , which we briefly review in sections  [ sect : nlo ] and [ sect : simulation ] . except for the inclusion of the nlo calculations our model closely follows tig . in section  [",
    "sect : fluxes ] we show the neutrino and muon fluxes we obtain for different low @xmath0 behaviors of the gluon pdf and we compare them with the tig fluxes . in section  [ sect : analytic ] , we give analytic arguments that explain and support our results .",
    "finally , as in ggv1 ( and tig ) , we consider only vertical showers for simplicity . we intend to study those from all directions in the future .",
    "our nlo calculation is based on the mnr computer code .",
    "the nlo cross section for charm production depends on the choice of the parton distribution functions and on three parameters : the charm quark mass @xmath18 , the renormalization scale @xmath22 , and the factorization scale @xmath23 . in order to calibrate the charm production routines we fit the most recent experimental data @xcite ( differential and total cross sections ) with one and the same combination of @xmath18 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 , for each pdf we use ( see @xcite for complete details ) .",
    "several choices of @xmath18 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 may work equally well .",
    "in fact the cross sections increase by decreasing @xmath23 , @xmath22 or @xmath18 , so changes in the three variables can be played against each other to obtain practically the same results .",
    "we use just one such choice for each pdf .",
    "we intend to further study the uncertainty related to this range of possible choices in the future .    as in ggv1",
    ", here we use the pdf s mrs r1 , r2 @xcite and cteq 4 m @xcite , with the following parameters .",
    "we choose @xmath25 , @xmath26 for all sets , where @xmath27 is the transverse mass , @xmath28 , and @xmath29    the data we use for this ` calibration ' of the mnr program are shown in table 1 and table 2 of ggv1 . in this paper , we add to our list of pdf s the latest of the mrs set , the mrst @xcite , with charm mass @xmath30 obtained with the same procedure used for the other pdf s .    as we will see clearly in sect .",
    "[ sect : analytic ] , due to the steep decrease with increasing energy of the incoming flux of cosmic rays , only the most energetic charm quarks produced count , and these come from the interactions of projectile partons carrying a large fraction of the incoming nucleon momentum .",
    "thus , the characteristic @xmath0 of the projectile parton , that we call @xmath31 , is large .",
    "it is @xmath32 .",
    "we can , then , immediately understand that very small partonic momentum fractions are needed in our calculation , because typical partonic center of mass energies @xmath33 are close to the @xmath34 threshold , @xmath35 gev ( since the differential cross section decreases with increasing @xmath36 ) while the total center of mass energy squared is @xmath37 ( with @xmath38 the nucleon mass , @xmath39 gev ) .",
    "calling @xmath40 the momentum fraction of the target parton ( in a nucleus of the atmosphere ) , then @xmath41 gev/@xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath42 ) , where @xmath8 is the energy per nucleon of the incoming cosmic ray in the lab .",
    "the characteristic energy @xmath43 of the charm quark and the dominant leptonic energy @xmath44 in the fluxes are @xmath45 , thus @xmath46 ) .",
    "namely @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 tev ) , pdf s are available from global analyses of existing data .",
    "we use four sets of pdf s .",
    "three of these , mrs r1 , mrs r2 @xcite and cteq 4 m @xcite ( used also in ggv1 ) , incorporate most of the latest hera data and cover the range of parton momentum fractions @xmath51 and momentum transfers @xmath52 .",
    "mrs r1 and mrs r2 differ only in the value of the strong coupling constant @xmath53 at the z boson mass : in mrs r1 @xmath54 , and in mrs r2 @xmath55 .",
    "the former value is suggested by `` deep inelastic scattering '' experiments , and the latter by lep measurements .",
    "this difference leads to different values of the pdf parameters at the reference momentum @xmath56 , where the qcd evolution of the mrs r1 and r2 pdf s is started .",
    "the cteq 4 m is the standard choice in the @xmath57 scheme in the most recent group of pdf s from the cteq group ( @xmath58 for cteq 4 m ) . in this paper",
    "we also use the very recent mrst @xcite .",
    "this new pdf set includes all the latest experimental measurements that have become available and , for the first time , an investigation of the uncertainty in the gluon distribution function .",
    "we will use the main choice of the mrst set , the  central gluon \" mrst , the central value of the gluon pdf s of the package , which is considered the optimum global choice of this new set .",
    "the range in @xmath59 and @xmath0 of mrst set is the same as for the older mrs r1-r2 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 .    for @xmath63 ,",
    "all these pdf s go as @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes valence quarks @xmath66 , sea quarks @xmath67 , or gluons @xmath68 .",
    "the pdf s we used have @xmath69 , in contrast to older sets of pdf s which assumed an equality .",
    "as @xmath0 decreases the density of gluons grows rapidly . at @xmath70",
    "it is comparable to the quark densities but , as @xmath0 decreases it increasingly dominates over them .",
    "quark densities become negligible at @xmath71 .",
    "the pdf s need to be extrapolated to @xmath72 ( @xmath73 tev ) .",
    "extrapolations based on regge analysis usually propose @xmath74 with @xmath75 @xcite , while evolution equations used to resum the large logarithms @xmath76 mentioned before , such as the bfkl ( balitsky , fadin , kuraev , lipatov @xcite ) find also @xmath77 , but with @xmath78 .    in this work",
    "we use extrapolations with different values of @xmath16 . for the older mrs r1-r2 and cteq 4 m we consider only the two extreme behaviors and the intermediate one that we used in ggv1 , namely : ( i ) a constant extrapolation @xmath79 for @xmath80 ; ( ii ) a linear extrapolation of @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is taken at @xmath85 , the smallest @xmath0 for which the pdf s are provided ( we call @xmath16(r1 ) , @xmath16(r2 ) or @xmath16(4 m ) the @xmath16 s so obtained ) ; ( iii ) an extrapolation with @xmath86 for @xmath87 cases ( i ) and ( iii ) are extreme choices theoretically justified before @xcite , while ( ii ) is somewhat in between , with a resulting @xmath88 .",
    "for the new mrst we have included several values of @xmath16 , in order to test the dependence on this parameter in a more complete way : ( i ) extrapolations with different @xmath16 s , i.e. @xmath89 for @xmath80 ; ( ii ) we also included the linear extrapolation of @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 , similar to the second intermediate choice of the previous list ; we will call @xmath16(t ) the @xmath16 obtained in this way .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the computer simulation used to calculate the neutrinos and muons fluxes ; a more detailed description can be found in ggv1 @xcite .",
    "the charm production process in the atmosphere and the particle cascades are simulated by modifying and combining together two different programs : the mnr routines @xcite and pythia 6.115 @xcite .    the mnr program was modified to become an event generator for charm production at different heights in the atmosphere and for different energies of the incoming primary cosmic rays .",
    "the charm quarks ( and antiquarks ) generated by this first stage of the program are then fed into a second part which handles quark showering , fragmentation and the interactions and decays of the particles down to the final leptons .",
    "the cascade evolution is therefore followed throughout the atmosphere : the muon and neutrino fluxes at sea level are the final output of the process .    in order to make our results comparable to those of tig , we keep the same modeling of the atmosphere and of the primary cosmic ray flux as in tig and the same treatment of particle interactions and decays in the cascade .",
    "we recall however that our main improvements are the inclusion of a true nlo contribution for charm production , the use of updated pdf s and , in this second paper , the different extrapolations used for the gluon pdf at low @xmath0 .",
    "in the rest of this section we review briefly the model for the atmosphere and the primary flux used in this study , which is the same of ggv1 and was introduced originally by tig .",
    "we assume a simple isothermal model for the atmosphere . its density at vertical height @xmath90 is @xmath91 with the parameters , scale height @xmath92 and column density @xmath93 at @xmath94 , chosen as in tig to fit the actual density in the range @xmath95 , important for cosmic ray interactions . along the vertical direction ,",
    "the amount of atmosphere traversed by a particle , the depth @xmath96 , is related to the height @xmath90 simply by @xmath97 the atmospheric composition at the important heights is approximately constant : 78.4% nitrogen , 21.1% oxygen and 0.5% argon with average atomic number @xmath98 = 14.5 .",
    "following tig @xcite , we neglect the detailed cosmic ray composition and consider all primaries to be nucleons with energy spectrum @xmath99    = \\phi_0 e^{-\\gamma-1}= \\\\ & & \\hskip-8em = \\begin{cases }    { 1.7 ( e/{\\rm gev})^{-2.7 } & for $ e < 5~10 ^ 6 $ gev\\cr     174 ( e/{\\rm gev})^{-3 } & for $ e",

    "an approximate expression for the intensity of the primary flux at a depth @xmath96 is ( see @xcite again ) @xmath100 the nuclear attenuation length @xmath101 , defined as @xmath102 has a mild energy dependence through @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the spectrum - weighted moment for nucleon regeneration in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "we use the @xmath104 values in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "the interaction thickness @xmath103 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number density of air nuclei of atomic weight @xmath107 at height @xmath90 and @xmath108 is the total inelastic cross section for collisions of a nucleon @xmath109 with a nucleus @xmath107 .",
    "this cross section scales essentially as @xmath110 , @xmath111 .",
    "for @xmath112 we use the fit to the available data in ref .",
    "@xcite . using our height independent atmospheric composition",
    ", we simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) as follows , @xmath113 here @xmath114 denotes average and u is the atomic mass unit , that we write as @xmath115 therefore in our approximations @xmath116 is independent of height .",
    "we present here the results of our simulations with all the pdf s and the values of @xmath16 described in section  [ sect : nlo ] .",
    "the nlo total inclusive charm - anticharm production cross sections @xmath117 for our four different pdf s are shown in fig .  1 over the energy range needed by our program , @xmath118 gev .",
    "in the top part of the figure we compare the results of mrs r1-r2 and cteq 4 m ( with their different values of @xmath16 described before ) to the cross section used in the tig model . in the bottom part",
    "we show the same comparison , done just with the new mrst , with its different @xmath16 s ( in all these figures cross sections increase for increasing values of @xmath16 ) .",
    "all these cross sections were calculated using the mnr program , with the ` calibration ' described in sect .",
    "[ sect : nlo ] , up to the nlo contribution .",
    "we can see in the figure that all our cross sections agree at low energies , as expected due to our ` calibration ' at 250 gev , and are very similar for energies up to @xmath119 gev . beyond this energy",
    "they start showing their dependence on the @xmath16 value and also a slight dependence on the pdf used , which was already noticed in ggv1 .",
    "as it can be seen from both parts of the figure , the increase of the cross sections with @xmath16 is evident at the highest energies : at the maximum energy considered the cross sections for the two extreme values of @xmath16 differ by almost a factor of ten .",
    "we also notice that , for energies above @xmath120 gev , our cross sections are always considerably higher than the one used by tig .",
    "as we have already explained in ggv1 , tig used an option of pythia by which the gluon pdf is extrapolated for @xmath121 with @xmath122 .",
    "in fact the tig cross section at the highest energies shows the same slope of our results for @xmath123 , but is always lower than our lowest cross sections by about a factor of three .",
    "this can be explained only in part by the fact that the tig cross section up to nlo is the lo result obtained with pythia , multiplied by a constant @xmath4 factor of 2 , while at large energies the @xmath4 factor ( see ggv1 for details ) is actually larger than 2 by about 10 - 15% .",
    "the bulk of the difference is however due to the different evaluations of the cross sections , even at lo , done by the mnr routines ( our method ) and directly by pythia ( approach used by tig ) .",
    "our results for the prompt fluxes are shown in figs .",
    "25 , for mrs r1-r2 , cteq 4 m and mrst .    in figs .  2 and",
    "3 we show the @xmath124-weighted vertical prompt fluxes @xmath125 , calculated to nlo , for muons and muon - neutrinos , together with the fluxes from tig , both from prompt and conventional sources ( dotted lines ) .",
    "the flux of electron - neutrinos is practically the same as that of muon - neutrinos .",
    "4 describes the spectral index of the differential fluxes , defined as @xmath126 .",
    "the effects of the different extrapolations of @xmath11 to @xmath127 ( see sect .  [",
    "sect : nlo ] ) are noticeable at @xmath128 . in figs .  2 and  3 , the @xmath124-weighted fluxes increase with @xmath129 :",
    "they can differ by up to two orders of magnitude at the highest energy considered , @xmath130 gev , for the two extreme choices of @xmath129 .",
    "this behavior is similar for all the pdf s considered .",
    "the @xmath16 dependence of the fluxes can also affect the energy at which the prompt contribution dominates over the conventional sources : this is particularly true for the muon fluxes as it can be seen in fig .  2 ; for the @xmath131 fluxes this effect is less important ( see fig .  3 ) and it does nt exist for the @xmath132 fluxes , for which the conventional contribution is much lower . apart from these differences due to the @xmath16 values , charm decay dominates over conventional sources at @xmath133 for muons , @xmath134 for muon - neutrinos , and @xmath135 for electron - neutrinos .",
    "we also see that all our fluxes for @xmath136 are similar to those of tig at energies above @xmath137 gev .",
    "we have already mentioned that tig used a very low value of @xmath16 , @xmath122 .",
    "it is remarkable that , for these low values of @xmath16 , we obtain similar final fluxes in spite of the differences of the two simulations and of the total cross sections already noted in fig .  1",
    ".    we can also compare our fluxes to those of the recent prs results @xcite .",
    "as we have already noticed in ggv1 , for intermediate values of @xmath16 our results are very similar to the prs ones . from fig .  3 , for example",
    ", we see that our fluxes for the @xmath138 case ( calculated with mrst ) are close to the corresponding prs results shown in fig .",
    "@xcite , calculated with cteq 3 m and @xmath139 .",
    "our results are lower than the prs by @xmath140 at the highest energies , which is probably due to the pdf s used and to the different approach of the two groups .    regarding the dependence of the spectral index @xmath141 on the slope @xmath16 of the gluon pdf , we notice in fig .  4 that , for all four pdf s , above about @xmath137 gev the differences in slope between the @xmath142 and @xmath143 fluxes is about 0.5 , suggesting that the spectral index is @xmath144 , namely , @xmath145 where @xmath146 is an energy dependent coefficient , that can be read off directly from the @xmath142 curve ( @xmath146 is the spectral index for @xmath142 )",
    "we will justify this result in sect .",
    "[ sect : analytic ] . due to this linear dependence of the spectral index on @xmath16 , given a model which specifies the function @xmath146 , the value of @xmath16 could be determined through a measurement of any of the @xmath147 fluxes at two different energies .",
    "we will study in detail this possibility elsewhere @xcite .    here",
    "we only comment on the typical rates in a km@xmath148 detector .",
    "it can be estimated from the curves of fig .  2 that the number of prompt atmospheric muons traversing a km@xmath148 detector from above would be over 100 per year around a muon energy of 1 pev , decreasing rapidly to less than 1 per year above 100 pev .",
    "in this energy range there is a concrete possibility of detecting these prompt muons .",
    "notice that the intensity of the prompt muon flux depends critically on the value of @xmath16 , suggesting still another way to estimate @xmath16 through the measurement of the fluxes .    in fig .",
    "5 we study the dependence of the prompt fluxes on the pdf for fixed values of @xmath16 .",
    "we summarize our previous results for @xmath149 ( left ) and for @xmath150 ( right ) , and compare them again to tig .",
    "the figures on the top show the @xmath124-weighted fluxes , those on the bottom the spectral indices . as we already noticed in ggv1 ,",
    "the dependence on the pdf is not strong , all fluxes are very similar .",
    "this indicates that our procedure for the ` calibration ' of our simulation with different pdf s ( described in sect .",
    "[ sect : nlo ] ) is good .",
    "there are , however , some differences between the pdf s : in some cases ( especially for @xmath149 ) the results of mrs r2 and cteq 4 m are very similar and higher than those of mrs r1 and mrst ( also very close to each other ) .",
    "the maximum difference between all these fluxes is at the level of 30 to 70% at high energies .",
    "we want here to remark once more that our @xmath149 fluxes are very close to that of tig at energies above @xmath137 gev ( and also below @xmath151 gev , but the prompt fluxes are not important at these low energies ) . for increasing values of @xmath16 ,",
    "our results are higher than tig , even by two orders of magnitude for @xmath150 and at the highest energies . from the bottom part of the figure we notice that also the spectral indices are almost independent of the pdf used .",
    "this indicates that the linear dependence between @xmath141 and @xmath16 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:11 ] ) is not affected by the choice of the pdf and again might be used to determine the value of @xmath16 .",
    "we will return on this analysis in more details in another paper @xcite .",
    "in this section we first find the characteristic values of the partonic momentum fractions in the cosmic ray nucleus and in the nucleus in the atmosphere , and then derive the linear relation between the slope of the atmospheric muon ( or neutrino ) fluxes and the slope of the gluon parton distribution function .",
    "we first show that the characteristic values of the partonic momentum fractions of the incoming cosmic ray parton , @xmath31 , and of the target parton belonging to a nucleus in the atmosphere , @xmath40 , are respectively , @xmath152 where @xmath8 is the energy of the incoming nucleon ( a proton in this paper ) in the atmosphere reference frame . precisely because of the small value of @xmath40 , for the relevant energies @xmath153 the gluon density @xmath154 is much larger than the density of quarks , which we , thus , neglect in these analytic arguments .",

    "this means that the uncertainties on the composition of cosmic rays will not affect the results through shadowing effects .    as a summary of our arguments we can say that , due to the incoming flux being rapidly falling with increasing energy of the primary , only the charm quarks produced with a large fraction of the incoming energy , @xmath273 , count in the charm flux at production , and those highly energetic @xmath274 quarks come from projectile partons carrying a large fraction of the incoming momentum @xmath275 . on the other hand , because typical partonic center of mass energies @xmath276 are close to the @xmath277 threshold , @xmath35 gev ( since the cross section decreases steeply with increasing @xmath276 ) , while the total center of mass energy squared is @xmath278 ( with @xmath213 the proton mass , @xmath279 gev ) , the product @xmath280 gev/@xmath281 .",
    "this shows that @xmath282 ( gev/@xmath283 gev/@xmath284 .",
    "we now derive the dependence on @xmath16 of the muon and neutrino fluxes for a simple power law primary flux .",
    "we can explain first the dependence on @xmath16 of the spectral index of @xmath285 at large energies , and then , using this result , the dependence on @xmath16 of the spectral indices of atmospheric muons and neutrinos .",
    "to start with , we notice that the integral in eq .",
    "( 28 ) depends on the charm energy @xmath43 only through the presence of the parameter @xmath249 in the integration on @xmath40 . to approximately perform this integration at large energies ,",
    "let us replace @xmath286 in eq .",
    "( 28 ) and take @xmath287 ( namely develop @xmath288 in powers of @xmath289 and keep only the constant term ) then @xmath290 since @xmath291 , this integral is well approximated by @xmath292 , for all @xmath293 .",
    "better approximations to the function @xmath288 give similar results .",
    "for example , approximating the function @xmath288 by two power laws , one above and another below the maximum , which is at about @xmath294 ( @xmath295 for @xmath40 between @xmath249 and @xmath296 and @xmath297 for @xmath40 between @xmath298 and @xmath299 ) , the integral in eq.([eq:27 ] ) becomes @xmath300 .",
    "thus the essential dependence of @xmath301 is maintained .",
    "recalling that @xmath302 , eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) is proportional to @xmath303 , and the same is true for eq .",
    "( [ eq:27 ] ) , therefore @xmath304    the charm production function @xmath155 , calculated numerically , is shown in fig .",
    "7a for a typical @xmath305 ( @xmath90 = 20 km ) .",
    "we are using here the pdf mrs r1 with the three related values of @xmath149 , @xmath16(r1 ) , 0.5 .",
    "we clearly see here that the slope at @xmath306 depends on the extrapolation of the gluon pdf at @xmath307 .",
    "this is one order of magnitude lower in energy than in fig .  1 for the total cross section .",
    "this reflects the fact mentioned above that the characteristic charm energy is @xmath308 .",
    "7b shows that , as predicted analytically , the slopes ( the negative of the spectral index in our notation ) of the charm fluxes at production depend almost linearly on @xmath309 .",
    "in fact , in fig .  7b , we can see that the logarithmic slopes of the @xmath142 and @xmath310 fluxes differ precisely by 0.5 , above 5 10@xmath311 ( namely , above the knee ) to about @xmath312 ( the maximum energy at which our fluxes are reliable , given that we take @xmath313 gev as the maximum incoming proton energy @xmath8 ) .",
    "in fact , the slope of the @xmath142 flux in that interval is about -3.1 to -3.2 , while that of the @xmath314 flux is about -2.6 to -2.7 . above the knee ,",
    "the primary spectrum goes as @xmath315 with @xmath316 , where we have also included the @xmath258 contribution coming from the @xmath8-dependence of @xmath101 ( see footnote in previous discussion ) , thus the charm spectrum , ( in the energy range @xmath317 ) goes approximately as @xmath318 as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) .    using the definition of the leptonic fluxes in terms of the charm spectrum at production @xmath319",
    ", we can now find the dependence of the spectral index of muon and neutrino fluxes with @xmath16 .",
    "for example , the differential flux @xmath320 of muons with energy @xmath321 ( @xmath322 stands here for @xmath323 or @xmath324 ) is @xmath325 \\label{eq:29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( @xmath320 has , thus , units of @xmath326 @xmath327 s sr gev ] ) . here",
    "the factor of 2 accounts for the muons produced by @xmath328 and the last square bracket is the number of muons of energy @xmath321 produced at sea level by the cascades , each cascade initiated by a @xmath21 quark of energy @xmath43 at a depth @xmath96 .",
    "our results above indicate that we can write the atmospheric charm spectrum at production as ( see eq.([eq:28 ] ) ) @xmath329 with @xmath330 a function independent of energy . replacing this form for @xmath331 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:29 ] ) and multiplying and dividing by @xmath332 we can write @xmath333 as @xmath334 \\label{eq:30}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we can argue that in so far as the values of the parent charm quark energy @xmath335 and the daughter lepton energy @xmath336 are not very different , the dependence of the integral on @xmath16 ( and on @xmath173 ) should be mild . in this case , from eq .",
    "( [ eq:30 ] ) , we find that the spectral index of the muon ( and similarly of the neutrino ) flux contains @xmath16 as a term , i.e. @xmath337 where the dependence of the functions @xmath338 and @xmath339 on @xmath16 and @xmath173 should be mild .",
    "this justifies the results shown in figs .  4 and  5 , presented in sect .",

    "it is evident that , in the range where our theoretical arguments are applicable ( for @xmath344 ) the @xmath345 functions differ only by @xmath346 for different @xmath129 values , namely they are almost independent of @xmath347 , given one particular pdf .",

    "the actual next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculations of charm production cross sections , together with a full simulation of the atmospheric cascades , were used to obtain the vertical prompt fluxes of neutrinos and muons .",
    "we have analyzed the dependence of the atmospheric fluxes on the extrapolation of the gluon pdf at very low @xmath0 , which is related to the value of the parameter @xmath129 .",
    "this was done using four different sets of pdf s : mrs r1 , mrs r2 , cteq 4 m and mrst , with variable @xmath129 in the range 00.5 .",
    "the charm production cross sections and the final lepton fluxes depend critically on @xmath16 for leptonic energies @xmath349 , which correspond to @xmath350 .",
    "we found that the fluxes vary up to almost two orders of magnitude at the highest energy considered , @xmath312 , for the different @xmath16 s in the allowed interval ; on the contrary , for fixed @xmath16 , the results do nt depend much on the choice of the pdf .",
    "for the lowest values of @xmath16 ( @xmath351 ) our fluxes are very close to those of tig @xcite , confirming that the very low flux prediction is mostly due to a low value of @xmath16 ( @xmath352 ) . for higher values of @xmath16 ( @xmath353 )",
