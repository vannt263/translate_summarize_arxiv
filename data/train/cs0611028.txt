    "historically , the theory of error - correcting codes has benefited greatly from the use of techniques from algebra and algebraic geometry .",
    "combinatorial and graph - theoretic methods have also proven to be useful in the construction and analysis of codes , especially within the last ten years since the re - discovery of low - density parity - check codes .",
    "however , one area of mathematics that has , surprisingly , only played a relatively minor role in the development of coding theory is the field of matroid theory .",
    "the reason this is surprising is that , as anyone with even a basic understanding of the two fields would realize , coding theory and matroid theory are very closely related .",
    "the former deals with matrices over a finite field @xmath2 , and these objects are also of fundamental importance in the latter , where they go under the name of @xmath2-representable matroids .    the connection with matroid theory has not gone unnoticed among coding theorists .",
    "indeed , as far back as 1976 , greene @xcite noticed that the tutte polynomial of a matroid , when specialized to a linear code @xmath0 , was equivalent ( in a certain sense ) to the homogeneous weight - enumerator polynomial @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of words of weight @xmath5 in @xmath0 , and @xmath6 is the length of @xmath0 .",
    "the macwilliams identities are then a special case of a known identity for the tutte polynomial ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  4 ) .",
    "the connection with matroids was also exploited by barg @xcite to derive macwilliams - type identities for generalized - hamming - weight enumerators of a code .",
    "however , aside from such use of tools from matroid theory to re - derive results in coding theory that had already been proved by other means , each field seems to have had little impact on the other .",
    "matroid theory has derived its inspiration largely from graph theory , and its most successful applications have traditionally been in the areas of combinatorial optimization and network flows . very recently , matroid theory has found new applications in the rapidly evolving field of network coding @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "coding theory ( by which we mean the theory of error - correcting codes , in contrast to the theory of network coding ) has been largely unconcerned with developments in combinatorial optimization , as the fundamental problems in the former seemed to be of a different nature from those in the latter . however , the recent re - formulation of the maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding problem , for a binary linear code over a discrete memoryless channel , as a linear programming problem @xcite has opened a channel through which matroid - theoretic results in combinatorial optimization can be applied to coding theory .",
    "the key tool in these results is the use of the decomposition theory of matroids initiated by seymour @xcite , @xcite .",
    "based on seymour s seminal work , grtschel and truemper @xcite showed that the minimization of a linear functional over the cycle polytope of a binary matroid could be solved in polynomial time for certain classes of matroids .",
    "this immediately implies that for the corresponding families of codes , the ml decoding problem can be solved in time polynomial in the length of the code .",
    "given the fact that the ml decoding problem is known to be np - hard in general @xcite , the existence of `` non - trivial '' classes of codes for which ml decoding can be implemented in polynomial time , is obviously a significant result .",
    "however , as we will show in this paper , for a code family to which the grtschel - truemper result applies , either the dimension or minimum distance of the codes in the family grows sub - linearly with codelength .",
    "thus , such code families are not good from a coding - theoretic perspective .",
    "however , they do illustrate the important point that polynomial - time ml decoding is possible .",
    "moreover , the matroid - theoretic arguments used by grtschel and truemper do not rule out the possibility that there may exist other code families for which polynomial - time ml decoding algorithms exist , which are also good in terms of rate and minimum distance .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to provide an exposition of the ideas needed to understand and apply the work of grtschel and truemper .",
    "as mentioned earlier , their work relies upon the machinery provided by seymour s matroid decomposition theory , and so we will first present that theory in a coding - theoretic setting .",
    "our presentation of this decomposition theory will be of a tutorial nature .",
    "we have attempted to keep the presentation self - contained to the extent possible ; we do not provide complete proofs of some of the difficult theorems that form the basis of the theory .",
    "we provide the relevant definitions and background from matroid theory in section  [ matroid_section ] of this paper . as explained in that section , binary matroids and binary linear codes",
    "are essentially the same objects .",
    "so , techniques applicable to binary matroids are directly applicable to binary linear codes as well .",
    "in particular , matroid decomposition techniques can be specialized to codes .",
    "of central importance in matroid theory is the notion of matroid minors . in the context of codes ,",
    "a minor of a code @xmath0 is any code that can be obtained from @xmath0 by a sequence of shortening and puncturing operations .",
    "minors have received little ( if any ) attention in coding theory , and this seems to be a remarkable oversight given the fact that they sometimes capture important structural properties of a code .",
    "for example , the presence or absence of certain minors ( as stated precisely in theorem  [ graphic_code_thm ] ) decides whether or not a code is graphic , _",
    "i.e. _ , has a parity - check matrix that is the vertex - edge incidence matrix of some graph .",
    "graphic codes have been studied previously in the information theory literature @xcite,@xcite , but the excluded - minor characterization of these codes appears to have been overlooked in these studies .    in section  [ conn_section ] , we introduce a notion of @xmath7-connectedness for codes , which is again a specialization of the corresponding notion for matroids .",
    "this is closely related to @xmath7-connectedness in graphs , and interestingly enough , is also related to the trellis complexity of a code @xcite .",
    "we do not explore the latter relationship in any detail in this paper , instead referring the reader to @xcite , @xcite , where matroid methods are used to study the structure of codes with low trellis complexity .    the notion of @xmath7-connectedness plays an important role in seymour s decomposition theory .",
    "an idea of why this is so can be obtained from the simple case of 2-connectedness : it follows from the relevant definitions that a code is not 2-connected if and only if it is the direct sum of smaller codes .",
    "similar statements can be made for codes that are not 3- or 4-connected ( or more precisely , not internally 4-connected  see definition  [ int_4conn_def ] ) via the code - composition operations of 2-sum and 3-sum introduced by seymour @xcite .",
    "these operations , as well as the @xmath8-sum which is in a sense the dual operation to the 3-sum , are explained in detail in section  [ decomp_section ] .",
    "the operations of 2- , 3- and @xmath8-sum have the non - trivial property that when two codes @xmath9 and @xmath10 are composed using one of these sums to form a code @xmath0 , then @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ( up to code equivalence ) minors of @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath7-connectedness and these sums can then be summarized as follows : a binary linear code is 2-connected but not 3-connected ( resp .",
    "3-connected , but not internally 4-connected ) iff it can be expressed as the 2-sum ( resp .",
    "3- or @xmath8-sum ) of codes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , both of which are equivalent to minors of @xmath0 .",
    "it follows immediately from the above facts that any binary linear code is either 3-connected and internally 4-connected , or can be constructed from 3-connected , internally 4-connected minors of it by a sequence of operations of coordinate permutation , direct sum , 2-sum , 3-sum and @xmath8-sum .",
    "in fact , given any code , such a decomposition of the code can be obtained in time polynomial in the length of the code .",
    "this code decomposition theory has immediate applications to families of codes that are minor - closed in the sense that for each code @xmath0 in such a family @xmath11 , any code equivalent to a minor of @xmath0 is also in @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , a code @xmath0 is in a minor - closed family @xmath11 only if the indecomposable ( _ i.e. _ , 3-connected , internally 4-connected ) pieces obtained in the aforementioned decomposition of @xmath0 are in @xmath11 .",
    "the above necessary condition is also sufficient if the code family @xmath11 is additionally closed under the operations of direct sum , 2-sum , 3-sum and @xmath8-sum .",
    "thus , membership of an arbitrary code in such a family @xmath11 can be decided in polynomial time iff the membership in @xmath11 of 3-connected , internally 4-connected codes can be decided in polynomial time . a formal statement of these and other related facts can be found in section  [ minor_closed_section ] of our paper .",
    "as an illustrative example , we also outline in section  [ minor_closed_section ] one of the major applications of seymour s decomposition theory .",
    "this concerns the family of regular codes which are codes that do not contain as a minor any code equivalent to the @xmath12 $ ] hamming code or its dual .",
    "regular codes are also characterized by the property that given any parity - check matrix @xmath13 of such a code , the 1 s in @xmath13 can be replaced by @xmath14 s in such a way that the resulting @xmath15 matrix is totally unimodular .",
    "a totally unimodular matrix is a real matrix all of whose square submatrices have determinants in @xmath16 .",
    "these matrices are of fundamental importance in integer linear programming problems @xcite .",
    "seymour @xcite proved that a binary linear code is regular iff it can be decomposed into codes that are either graphic , or duals of graphic codes , or equivalent to a special @xmath17 $ ] code he called @xmath18 .    the application of the decomposition theory to linear programming , and in particular to ml decoding , is the subject of section  [ lp_section ] .",
    "_  showed that the ml decoding problem for a length-@xmath6 binary linear code @xmath0 over a discrete memoryless channel can be formulated as a minimization problem @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a certain cost vector derived from the received word and the channel transition probabilites , and the minimum is taken over all codewords @xmath21 in @xmath0 .",
    "now , if @xmath0 is a graphic code , then standard graph - theoretic techniques from combinatorial optimization can be used to find the minimizing codeword in time polynomial in @xmath6 ; a sketch of such an algorithm can be found in appendix  [ opt_app ] .",
    "grtschel and truemper @xcite additionally showed that this minimization could also be performed in polynomial time for certain minor - closed code families that are `` almost - graphic '' in a certain sense .",
    "such a code family @xmath11 is characterized by the property that there exists a _",
    "finite _ list of codes @xmath22 such that each @xmath23 can be decomposed in polynomial time in such a way that at each step of the decomposition , one of the pieces is either graphic or in @xmath22 .",
    "grtschel and truemper gave a polynomial - time algorithm that takes as input a length-@xmath6 code @xmath0 from an almost - graphic family @xmath11 and a cost vector @xmath24 , and constructs a codeword @xmath25 achieving @xmath19 by solving related minimization problems over the pieces of the decomposition that are graphic or in @xmath22 .",
    "this algorithm is also outlined in appendix  [ opt_app ] .",
    "thus , the ml decoding problem can be solved in polynomial time for almost - graphic codes .",
    "grtschel and truemper also gave several examples of almost - graphic families .",
    "interestingly enough , one of these families is that consisting of codes @xmath0 for which the codeword polytope ( _ i.e. _ , the convex hull in @xmath26 of the codewords in the length-@xmath6 code @xmath0 ) is identical to the koetter - vontobel fundamental polytope @xcite derived from the entire dual code @xmath1 .",
    "unfortunately , the one truly original result in this paper is a negative result .",
    "we show that for codes in an almost - graphic family , either their dimension or their minimum distance grows sub - linearly with codelength",
    ". one important implication of this is that decoding by linear programming , when applied to any good error - correcting code , must inevitably hit upon the occasional pseudocodeword , thus resulting in decoding failure .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "some of the lengthier or more technical proofs of results from sections  [ decomp_section ] and [ lp_section ] are given in appendices to preserve the flow of the presentation .",
    "we shall assume familiarity with coding theory ; for relevant definitions , see @xcite .",
    "we will mainly concern ourselves with binary linear codes , and use standard coding - theoretic notation throughout this paper .",
    "thus , an @xmath27 $ ] code is a code of length @xmath6 and dimension @xmath7 , and an @xmath28 $ ] code is an @xmath27 $ ] code that has minimum distance @xmath29 . given a code @xmath0 , @xmath30 denotes the dimension of @xmath0 , and @xmath1 denotes the dual code of @xmath0 .",
    "the main purpose of this section is to introduce concepts from matroid theory that are applicable to coding theory .",
    "we will largely follow the definitions and notation of oxley @xcite .",
    "we begin with a definition of matroids .    a _ matroid _",
    "@xmath31 is an ordered pair @xmath32 consisting of a finite set @xmath33 and a collection @xmath34 of subsets of @xmath33 satisfying the following three conditions :    * @xmath35 ; * if @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then @xmath38 ; and * if @xmath39 are in @xmath34 and @xmath40 , then there exists to denote the set difference @xmath41 .",
    "the more usual notation @xmath42 has been reserved for the matroid operation of `` deletion '' . ]",
    "@xmath43 such that @xmath44 .",
    "[ matroid_def ]    the set @xmath33 above is called the _ ground set _ of the matroid @xmath31 , and the members of @xmath34 are the _ independent sets _ of @xmath31 . a maximal independent set , _",
    "i.e. _ , a set @xmath45 such that @xmath46 for any @xmath47 , is called a _ basis _ of @xmath31 .",
    "it is a simple consequence of ( iii ) in definition  [ matroid_def ] that all bases of @xmath31 have the same cardinality .",
    "the cardinality of any basis of @xmath31 is defined to be the _ rank _ of @xmath31 , denoted by @xmath48 .",
    "a subset of @xmath33 that is not in @xmath34 is called a _",
    "dependent set_. minimal dependent sets , _",
    "i.e. , _ dependent sets all of whose proper subsets are in @xmath34 , are called _",
    "circuits_. it easily follows from the definitions that a subset of @xmath33 is a dependent set if and only if it contains a circuit . a dependent set that can be expressed as a disjoint union of circuits",
    "is called a _",
    "cycle_.    the above definitions of independent and dependent sets , bases and rank simply try to abstract the notion of independence and dependence , bases and dimension , respectively , in a vector space over a field .",
    "indeed , the most important class of matroids for our purposes is the class of binary matroids , which are simply vector spaces over the binary field , or to put it another way , binary linear codes .",
    "let @xmath13 be a binary @xmath49 matrix , and let @xmath50 denote the column vectors of @xmath13 .",
    "set @xmath51 and take @xmath34 to be the collection of subsets @xmath52 such that the sequence of vectors @xmath53 is linearly independent over the binary field @xmath54 .",

    "it is easily seen that @xmath66 is a minimal codeword of @xmath0 iff its support is a circuit of @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "it follows from this that for any @xmath67 , @xmath64 , we have @xmath25 iff @xmath68 is a cycle of @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , a routine verification shows that for binary matrices @xmath13 and @xmath69 , @xmath55 = m[h']$ ] iff @xmath13 and @xmath69 are parity - check matrices of the same code @xmath0 .",
    "this allows us to associate a unique binary matroid with each binary linear code @xmath0 , and vice versa .",
    "thus , binary matroids and binary linear codes are essentially the same objects .",
    "in particular , two codes are equivalent to denote the code obtained by applying the coordinate permutation @xmath70 to the code @xmath0 . ] if and only if their associated binary matroids are isomorphic .",
    "this association between codes and binary matroids allows us to use tools from matroid theory to study binary linear codes .    while many of the tools used to study matroids",
    "have their roots in linear algebra , there is another source that matroid theory draws from , namely , graph theory .",
    "whitney s founding paper on matroid theory @xcite was an attempt to capture the fundamental properties of independence that are common to graphs and matrices .",

    ", it can be shown that the [ 7,4 ] hamming code is not graphic .",
    "it is possible to give a precise characterization of the codes that are graphic in terms of excluded minors , a notion we need to first define .",
    "there are two well - known ways of obtaining codes of shorter length from a given parent code .",
    "one is via the operation of _ puncturing _ , in which one or more columns are deleted from a generator matrix of the parent code @xcite .",

    "pag codes inherit some of the properties of graphic codes .",

    "there exists a constant @xmath554 such that given any length-@xmath6 code @xmath0 in @xmath11 and any @xmath560 , a codeword @xmath561 achieving @xmath562 ( or equivalently , @xmath563 ) can be determined in @xmath556 time .",
    "[ pag_opt_thm ]    it should be noted that an actual implementation of the polynomial - time algorithm implicit in theorem  [ pag_opt_thm ] ( and outlined in appendix  [ opt_app ] ) requires arithmetic over the real numbers , unless the vector @xmath519 has only rational coordinates .",
    "so , in practice , finite - precision arithmetic used in any computer implementation of the algorithm could only approximate the linear cost function @xmath564 for an arbitrary @xmath24 .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "ml decoding over a discrete memoryless channel can be formulated as a linear program @xcite .",

    "in particular , geometrically perfect codes are ml - decodable in polynomial time .",
    "[ pag_cor1 ]    another problem that is known to be np - hard in general is the problem of determining the minimum distance of a code @xcite . for graphic codes",

    "so , the minimum distance of a code from a pag family can be determined in polynomial time using finite - precision arithmetic .",
    "the downside of pag ( and more generally , almost - graphic ) code families is that they are not very good from a coding - theoretic perspective .",
    "recall from coding theory that a code family @xmath11 is called _ asymptotically good _ if there exists a sequence of @xmath577 $ ] codes @xmath578 , with @xmath579 , such that @xmath580 and @xmath581 are both strictly positive",
    ".    an almost - graphic family of codes can not be asymptotically good .",
    "[ ag_bad_thm ]    in particular , the family of geometrically perfect codes is not asymptotically good . the theorem is proved in appendix  [ ag_bad_app ] . in view of lemma  [ pseudocodeword_lemma ] , the above result has the following very interesting corollary .",

    "then , @xmath11 is not an asymptotically good code family .",
    "loosely speaking , this means that linear - programming decoding , when applied to a `` good '' code , must suffer on occasion from decoding failure due to the presence of pseudocodewords , even if _ all _ possible parity checks ( dual codewords ) are used in the constraints ( [ q_eq1])([q_eq2 ] ) of the lp .",
    "given the close relationship between linear - programming decoding and iterative decoding using the min - sum algorithm @xcite , a similar result is likely to hold for iterative decoding as well .",
    "we end this section with an explanation of why 3-sums were left out of definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ pag_opt_thm ] given in appendix  [ opt_app ] relies crucially on the fact that a @xmath8-homogeneous , @xmath557-unary code - decomposition tree can be constructed in polynomial time for a code from a pag family .",
    "so , the result is actually true for any code family for which such trees can be constructed in polynomial time .",
    "now , if 3-sums were allowed in definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] , it is no longer obvious that codes from the resulting code family would still have @xmath8-homogeneous , @xmath557-unary code - decomposition trees .",
    "there is good reason to think that this could still be true , especially in light of corollary  [ 3sum_cor ] , which states that a code has a 3-sum decomposition only if it has a @xmath8-sum decomposition .",
    "indeed , that result may lead us to believe that if a code @xmath0 has a @xmath557-unary code - decomposition tree which contains 3-sums , then replacing the 3-sums in the tree with @xmath8-sums in the manner prescribed by corollary  [ 3sum_cor ] should result in a @xmath8-homogeneous , @xmath557-unary code - decomposition tree .",
    "however , to show that this is the case , it would have to be verified that if @xmath402 , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 satisfying ( a ) and ( b ) of definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] , then ( in the notation of corollary  [ 3sum_cor ] ) @xmath582 and @xmath583 also satisfy ( a ) and ( b ) . now , it is not hard to check that if @xmath9 is graphic , then so is @xmath582 . however ,",
    "unless @xmath0 is 3-connected , there is no guarantee that @xmath582 and @xmath583 are equivalent to minors of @xmath0 , even though @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given to be equivalent to minors of @xmath0 .",
    "it is in fact quite likely to be true that if @xmath402 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 equivalent to minors of @xmath0 , then @xmath582 and @xmath583 are also equivalent to minors of @xmath0 .",
    "so , it is quite possible that if definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] were to include 3-sums as well , then the resulting code families would still have @xmath8-homogeneous , @xmath557-unary code - decomposition trees , and hence theorem  [ pag_opt_thm ] would continue to hold .",
    "however , a rigorous proof of this would take us far outside the main theme of our paper , and definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] as it stands is good enough for our purposes .",
    "a natural question to ask upon studying the decomposition theory presented in this paper is whether one can define @xmath7-sums for @xmath584 that have the same attractive properties as 2- , 3- and @xmath8-sums .",

    "again , it seems that if we are prepared to give up the requirement that the components of a @xmath7-sum be retained as minors of the composite code , then it is possible to develop a powerful decomposition theory for nonbinary codes just like that for binary codes .",
    "we end with a pointer to a very interesting direction of current research in matroid theory .",
    "this involves the resolution of two conjectures whose statements ( in the context of codes ) we give below .",

    "given a subset @xmath690 of the vertices of @xmath71 , a _",
    "t - join _ is a set of edges @xmath90 of @xmath71 such that a vertex @xmath691 in @xmath71 has odd degree with respect to ( wrt ) @xmath90 if and only if @xmath692 .",
    "let @xmath693 be the set of edges @xmath694 , and let @xmath690 be the subset of vertices with odd degree wrt @xmath693 .",
    "define the graph @xmath695 to be the graph @xmath71 but with edge - weights @xmath696 , @xmath566 .",
    "find a minimum - weight @xmath690-join , @xmath90 , in @xmath695 .",
    "the symmetric difference @xmath697 is the required minimum - weight eulerian subgraph of @xmath71",
    ". a minimum - weight @xmath690-join can be found in polynomial time ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 29 ) , and so , a minimum - weight eulerian subgraph of @xmath71 can be determined in polynomial time .",
    "we will first prove that the family , @xmath85 , of graphic codes is not asymptotically good .",
    "this is probably a `` folk '' theorem , but we could not find an explicit proof in the literature .",
    "our proof relies on the fact @xcite that for a graph @xmath698 with girth @xmath699 and average degree @xmath700 , the number of vertices satisfies the so - called _ moore bound _ : @xmath701 for our purposes , the weaker bound @xmath702 is enough , as we then have , for @xmath703 , @xmath704 where , for the sake of concreteness , @xmath705 denotes the natural logarithm .    since codewords in @xmath84 correspond to cycles in @xmath71",
    ", we see that the minimum distance of @xmath84 equals the girth @xmath699 of the graph @xmath71 . furthermore , if @xmath71 is connected , then ( as mentioned in section  [ matroid_section ] ) the rank of its vertex - edge incidence matrix is @xmath706 , and hence , @xmath707 .",
    "thus , the rate of @xmath84 is @xmath708 .",
    "consequently , if a family of graphic codes has dimension growing linearly with codelength @xmath6 , then by ( [ g_bnd ] ) their minimum distance grows as @xmath709 , which implies that graphic codes are not asymptotically good .",
    "this argument is formalized in the proof given below .",
    "the family of graphic codes is not asymptotically good .",
    "[ graphic_bad_lemma ]    we will in fact prove a stronger statement : for @xmath710 , let @xmath711 ; then , for any code @xmath712 with length @xmath713 , we have @xmath714    consider first an @xmath28 $ ] code @xmath712 with @xmath715 . without loss of generality ( wlog ) , we can assume that @xmath716 for some connected graph @xmath698 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  1.2.8 ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath717 , or equivalently , @xmath718 . furthermore , since @xmath715 , we have that @xmath719 .",
    "therefore , the average degree , @xmath720 , of @xmath71 is larger than @xmath721 , which is in turn larger than @xmath722 . hence , by ( [ g_bnd ] ) , @xmath723 the last inequality above holds when @xmath724 , which is true for @xmath715 , since @xmath725 for @xmath710 , as a simple calculation will confirm .",
    "therefore , without the assumption @xmath715 , we have @xmath726 however , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath727 for any @xmath728 , from which we obtain that for @xmath713 , @xmath729 , and ( [ dmin_bnd ] ) follows .    given an almost - graphic code family @xmath11 , let @xmath22 be the finite sub - family of codes with the properties guaranteed by definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] .",
    "wlog , we may assume that @xmath22 is minor - closed .",
    "for @xmath710 , define @xmath730 to be the least positive integer such that for all @xmath731 , @xmath732 note that since @xmath733 , such an @xmath730 does exist .",
    "now , define @xmath734    we now have the definitions needed to state the next result , which shows that codes in @xmath11 can not have both dimension and minimum distance growing linearly with codelength .",
    "it is clear that theorem  [ ag_bad_thm ] follows directly from this result .",
    "let @xmath11 be an almost - graphic family of codes .",
    "for any @xmath710 , if @xmath23 is an @xmath28 $ ] code with @xmath735 , then @xmath736 [ ag_bad_lemma ]    from the definition of @xmath737 and ( [ dmin_bnd ] ) , it is obvious that the statement of the lemma holds for all codes in @xmath550 .",
    "the proof that the statement holds for all codes in @xmath11 is by induction on codelength for a fixed @xmath710 .",
    "so , fix an @xmath710 .",
    "if @xmath738 is the smallest length of a non - trivial code in @xmath11 , then a length-@xmath738 code in @xmath11 can not be decomposed into smaller codes , and so must be in @xmath550 .",
    "therefore , the statement of the lemma holds for the base case of length-@xmath738 codes .    now , suppose that for some @xmath739 , ( [ ag_dmin_bnd ] ) holds for all codes @xmath740 of length @xmath741 and rate larger than @xmath742 .",
    "let @xmath23 be an @xmath28 $ ] code with @xmath735 .",
    "if @xmath743 for some codes @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath11 , then at least one of @xmath9 and @xmath10 has rate larger than @xmath742 , and so ( [ ag_dmin_bnd ] ) holds for @xmath0 by the induction hypothesis .",
    "we may thus assume that @xmath0 is 2-connected .",
    "if @xmath744 , there is nothing to be proved .",
    "so , either @xmath327 or @xmath552 for @xmath745 as in definition  [ almost_graphic_def ] .",
    "wlog , we may take @xmath70 to be the identity permutation , so that @xmath0 is either @xmath280 or @xmath455 , for some @xmath746 $ ] code @xmath553 and some @xmath747 $ ] code @xmath748 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath276 first . by proposition  [ 2sum_prop1 ] , @xmath749 , and @xmath750 , where @xmath751 and @xmath752 .",
    "note that for @xmath195 , @xmath753 is an @xmath754 $ ] code , where @xmath755 and @xmath756 .",
    "thus , @xmath757 and @xmath758 .",
    "now , if @xmath759 for some @xmath760 , then the statement of the lemma holds for @xmath0 by the induction hypothesis .",
    "so , we are left with the situation when @xmath761 for @xmath195 .",
    "but in this case , since @xmath762 , we must have @xmath763 ; otherwise , we would have @xmath764 , which would mean that @xmath765 .",
    "note that since @xmath553 , and @xmath766 is a minor of @xmath9 , we have that @xmath767 . if @xmath768 or @xmath769 , then @xmath770 ; otherwise , @xmath766 is graphic with @xmath771 , and so , by ( [ dmin_bnd ] ) and the definition of @xmath730 , @xmath772 in any case , @xmath773 .",
    "since @xmath774 , we have that ( [ ag_dmin_bnd ] ) holds for @xmath0",
    ".    finally , we deal with the case when @xmath642 .",
    "the approach is essentially the same as that in the 2-sum case .",
    "this time , defining @xmath775 and @xmath776 , we have @xmath750 .",
    "for @xmath195 , we now find that @xmath753 is an @xmath754 $ ] code , where @xmath777 and @xmath778 .",
    "thus , @xmath758 , and via lemma  [ 3barsum_lemma ] , @xmath779 .",
    "if either @xmath780 or @xmath781 is larger than @xmath742 , then ( [ ag_dmin_bnd ] ) holds for @xmath0 by the induction hypothesis .",
    "so suppose that @xmath761 for @xmath193 .",
    "since @xmath782 , we must have @xmath783 ; otherwise , we would obtain @xmath765 . if @xmath768 or @xmath769 , then @xmath770 ; otherwise , @xmath766 is graphic with @xmath771 , and so , by ( [ dmin_bnd ] ) and the definition of @xmath730 , @xmath784 in any case , @xmath785 , and since @xmath774 , we see that ( [ ag_dmin_bnd ] ) holds for @xmath0 .",
