    "the fine - structure constant , @xmath5 , which determines the overall strength of the electromagnetic force , and the proton - to - electron mass ratio , @xmath6 , which relates the strengths of the forces in the strong sector to those in the electro - weak sector@xcite , are the only two dimensionless parameters that are required for the description of the gross structure of atomic and molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "the values of these two constants ensure that protons are stable , that a large number of heavy elements could form in the late evolution stage of stars , and that complex molecules based on carbon chemistry exist  @xcite . if these constants would have had only slightly different values , even by fractions of a percent , our universe would have looked entirely different .",
    "the question whether this _ fine tuning _ is coincidental or if the constants can be derived from a  yet unknown  theory beyond the standard model of physics , is regarded as one of the deepest mysteries in science .",
    "one solution to this enigma may be that the values of the fundamental constants of nature may vary in time , or may obtain different values in distinct parts of the ( multi)-universe .",
    "searches for drifting constants are motivated by this perspective .",
    "theories that predict spatial - temporal variations of @xmath7 and @xmath0 can be divided into three classes .",
    "the first class comprises a special type of quantum field theories that permit variation of the coupling strengths .",
    "bekenstein postulated a scalar field for the permittivity of free space ; this quintessential field then compensates the energy balance in varying @xmath7 scenarios to accommodate energy conservation as a minimum requirement for a theory  @xcite .",
    "based on this concept various forms of dilaton theories with coupling to the electromagnetic part of the lagrangian were devised , combined with cosmological models for the evolution of matter ( including dark matter ) and dark energy under the assumptions of general relativity .",
    "such scenarios provide a natural explanation for variation of fundamental constants over cosmic history , i.e. , as a function of red - shift parameter @xmath8 .",
    "the variation will freeze out under conditions , where the dark energy content has taken over from the matter content in the universe , a situation that has been reached almost completely  @xcite .",
    "these theories provide a rationale for searches of drifting constants at large look - back times toward the origin of the universe , even if laboratory experiments in the modern epoch were to rule out such variations .",
    "the second class of theories connects drifting constants to the existence of high order dimensions as postulated in many versions of modern string theory  @xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein theories , first devised in the 1920s , showed that formulations of electromagnetism in higher dimensions resulted in different effective values of @xmath7 , after compactification to the four observed dimensions .",
    "finally , the third class of theories , known as chameleon scenarios , postulate that additional scalar fields acquire mass depending on the local matter density @xcite .",
    "experimental searches for temporal variation of fundamental constants were put firmly on the agenda of contemporary physics by the ground - breaking study by webb _ _ et al.__@xcite an indication of a varying @xmath7 was detected by comparing metal absorptions at high redshift with corresponding transitions that were measured in the laboratory .",
    "as the observed transitions have in general a different dependence on @xmath7 , a variation manifests itself as a frequency shift of a certain line with respect to another .",
    "this is the basis of the many - multiplet - method for probing a varying fine structure constant.@xcite the findings triggered numerous laboratory tests that compare transitions measured in different atoms and molecules over the course of a few years and thus probe a much shorter time scale for drifting constants . in later work",
    ", webb and co - workers found indication for a spatial variation of @xmath7 in terms of a dipole across the universe.@xcite    spectroscopy provides a search ground for probing drifts in both @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "while electronic transitions , including spin - orbit interactions , are sensitive to @xmath7 , vibrational , rotational and tunneling modes in molecules are sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "hyperfine effects , such as in the cs - atomic clock@xcite and the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen@xcite , depend on both @xmath7 and @xmath0 , as do @xmath9-doublet transitions in molecules@xcite .",
    "the same holds for combined high - redshift observations of a rotational transition in co and a fine structure transition in atomic carbon,@xcite placing a tight constraint on the variation of the combination @xmath10 at a redshift as high as @xmath11 . within the framework of grand unification schemes theories",

    "@xmath16 is the fractional rate of change of @xmath0 , @xmath17 is the fractional frequency precision of the measurement , @xmath18 is the inherent sensitivity of a transition to a variation of @xmath0 , and @xmath19 is the time interval that is probed in the experiment . for a sensitive test",
    ", one needs transitions that are observed with a good signal to noise and narrow linewidth , and that exhibit high @xmath20 . in order to detect a possible variation of @xmath0 at least two transitions possessing a different sensitivity",
    "are required .",
    "note that , for detecting a variation of @xmath0 , it is not necessary to actually determine its value . in fact , in most cases this is impossible , since the exact relation between the value of @xmath0 and the observed molecular transitions is not known . only for the most simple systems such as and ,",
    "recently it became feasible to directly extract information on the value of @xmath0 from spectroscopic measurements  @xcite .",
    "so far , the numerical value of the proton - electron mass ratio , @xmath21 , is known at a fractional accuracy of @xmath22 and included in codata@xcite , while constraints on the fractional change of @xmath0 are below @xmath23/yr , as will be discussed in this paper .",
    "the most stringent independent test of the time variation of @xmath0 in the current epoch was set by comparing vibrational transitions in with a cesium fountain over the course of two years .",
    "the transitions were measured with a fractional accuracy of @xmath2410@xmath25 and have a sensitivity of @xmath26 , whereas the sensitivity coefficient of the transition is @xmath27@xcite , resulting in a limit on the variation of @xmath28 of @xmath29/yr.@xcite    in order to improve the constraints  or to detect a time - variation  attention has shifted to molecular species that possess transitions with greatly enhanced sensitivity coefficients .",
    "unfortunately , the transitions that have an enhanced sensitivity are often rather exotic , i.e. , transitions involving highly exited levels in complex molecules that pose considerable challenges to experimentalists and are difficult or impossible to observe in galaxies at high red - shift .",
    "nevertheless , a number of promising systems have been identified that might lead to competitive laboratory and astrophysical tests in the near future .",
    "in this perspective we review the current status of laboratory and astrophysical tests on a possible time - variation of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we outline the procedures for determining the sensitivity coefficients for the different molecular species .",
    "reviews on the topic of varying constants were presented by uzan  @xcite , approaching the subject from a perspective of fundamental physics , and by kozlov and levshakov  @xcite , approaching the topic from a molecular spectroscopy perspective .",
    "the induced frequency shift of a certain transition as a result of a drifting constant is  at least to first order  proportional to the fractional change in @xmath7 and @xmath0 and is characterized by its sensitivity coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath18 via    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the fractional change in the frequency of the transition and @xmath33 is the fractional change in @xmath0 , both with respect to their current - day values . from eq .",
    "we can derive an expression for @xmath18 ( and similarly for @xmath30 )    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 refer to the energy of the ground and excited state , respectively . note that the concept of a ground state may be extended to any lower state in a transition , even if this corresponds to a metastable state or a short - lived excited state in a molecule . this definition of @xmath18 yields opposite signs to that used in refs .",
    "although electronic transitions in atoms are sensitive to @xmath7 , they are relatively immune to a variation of @xmath0 . for instance , the frequency of the radiation emitted by a hydrogen - like element with nuclear charge @xmath37 and mass number @xmath38 in a transition between levels @xmath39 and @xmath40 is given by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the rydberg constant . in order to find the sensitivity coefficients of these transitions we apply eq .   and obtain    @xmath44    resulting in sensitivity coefficients of @xmath45 for the transitions of the lyman series in atomic hydrogen ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "let us now turn to transitions in molecules . within the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation ,",
    "the total energy of a molecule is given by a sum of uncoupled energy contributions , hence , we may rewrite eq .   as    @xmath47    where the summation index @xmath48 runs over the different energy contributions , such as electronic , vibrational , and rotational energy .",
    "it is generally assumed that the neutron - to - electron mass ratio follows the same behavior as the proton - to - electron mass ratio and no effects depending on quark structure persist@xcite . under this assumption",
    "all baryonic matter may be treated equally and @xmath0 is proportional to the mass of the molecule .",
    "hence , from the well - known isotopic scaling relations we find @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the inverse dependence of the sensitivity coefficient on the transition frequency suggests that @xmath18 is enhanced for near - degenerate transitions , i.e. , when the different energy contributions in the denominator of eq .",
    "cancel each other .",
    "this enhancement is proportional to the energy that is being cancelled and to the difference in the sensitivity coefficients of the energy terms . since in general @xmath52 ,",
    "cancellations between electronic , vibrational and rotational energies are unexpected .",
    "nevertheless , transitions with enhanced sensitivity due to a cancellation of vibrational and electronic energies have been identified in  @xcite and  @xcite . whereas cancellations between electronic and vibrational energies are purely coincidental",
    ", near - degeneracies occur as a rule in more complex molecules such as molecular radicals or poly - atomic molecules .",
    "these molecules have additional energy contributions that are comparable in magnitude to rotational and vibrational energies and exhibit a different functional dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , molecules in electronic states with non - zero electronic angular momentum have fine - structure splittings that are comparable to vibrational splittings in heavy molecules@xcite and to rotational splittings in light molecules  @xcite .",
    "likewise , molecules that possess nuclear spin have hyperfine splittings that can be comparable to rotational splittings@xcite . in polyatomic molecules , splittings due to classically - forbidden large - amplitude motions , such as inversion  @xcite or internal rotation@xcite , can be comparable to rotational splittings .",
    "finally , the renner - teller splitting , that originates from the interaction between electronic and vibrational angular momenta in linear polyatomic molecules , can be comparable to rovibrational splittings@xcite . + as discussed in the introduction , the sensitivity of a test depends both on the sensitivity coefficient and the fractional precision of the measured transition ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : detect_variation_int ] ) . for enhancements originating from cancellations between different modes of energy",
    "the sensitivity scales as the inverse frequency  i.e. , when two energy terms in the numerator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kmu ] ) are very similar the sensitivity coefficient becomes large while the transition frequency becomes small .",
    "the resolution of astrophysical observations are usually limited by doppler broadening which implies that the fractional precision , @xmath53 , is independent of the frequency .",
    "thus , for astrophysical tests the advantage of low frequency transitions with enhanced sensitivity is evident . for laboratory tests ,",
    "the motivation for choosing low frequency transitions is less obvious . due to the advances in frequency comb and optical clock techniques , the fractional precision of optical transitions",
    "has become superior to those in the microwave domain.@xcite it was therefore argued by zelevinsky  _ _ et al.__@xcite and others , that the best strategy for testing the time - variation of fundamental constants is to measure an as large as possible energy interval and accept the rather limited sensitivity coefficient that is associated with it .",
    "it may be true that optical clocks have a better fractional accuracy but microwave measurements still have a smaller absolute uncertainty .",
    "for instance , the most accurate optical clock based on a transition in al@xmath54 at 267  nm ( 1.12  phz ) has a fractional accuracy of @xmath55 , which corresponds to an absolute uncertainty of 27  mhz  @xcite , while the most accurate microwave clock , based on a transition in cesium at 9.2  ghz has a fractional accuracy of @xmath56 corresponding to an absolute uncertainty of 2  @xmath0hz  @xcite .",
    "it thus make sense to measure transitions in the microwave region , but only if favorable enhancement schemes are available .",
    "an additional advantage is that , in some well - chosen cases , transitions with opposite sensitivity coefficients can be used to eliminate systematic effects .",

    "<S> transitions in atoms and molecules provide an ideal test ground for constraining or detecting a possible variation of the fundamental constants of nature . in this perspective , we review molecular species that are of specific interest in the search for a drifting proton - to - electron mass ratio @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we outline the procedures that are used to calculate the sensitivity coefficients for transitions in these molecules and discuss current searches . </S>",
    "<S> these methods have led to a rate of change in @xmath0 bounded to @xmath1/yr from a laboratory experiment performed in the present epoch . on a cosmological time scale </S>",
    "<S> the variation is limited to @xmath2 for look - back times of 10 - 12 billion years and to @xmath3 for look - back times of 7 billion years . </S>",
    "<S> the last result , obtained from high - redshift observation of methanol , translates into @xmath4/yr if a linear rate of change is assumed . </S>"
