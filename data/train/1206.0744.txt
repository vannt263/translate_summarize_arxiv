    "at low frequencies ( mhz ) , millions of double white dwarf binaries in the galaxy are expected to dominate the gravitational wave ( gw ) sky . at the lowest frequencies they form an unresolved foreground , while at frequencies above several mhz , thousands of sources would be individually detectable for an instrument such as the laser interferometer space antenna , lisa ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) or elisa / ngo ( @xcite ) .",
    "these binaries come in two flavours : detached systems and semi - detached ( mass - transferring ) systems that are know as am cvn systems ( see @xcite , @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "several known binaries should be detected by lisa within the first weeks of operation and are known as verification binaries ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . by measuring their gravitational wave amplitude and frequency ( evolution ) , the type of astrophysical source and its parameters can be determined ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in all these calculations",
    "the gravitational wave signal was determined under the assumption that the binary white dwarf system can be represented by two point masses in orbit , even for the tidally deformed stars in semi - detached binaries .",
    "the goal of this study is to determine the accuracy of this assumption . in section [ section gravwaves ]",
    "we will discuss our method of calculating the gw signal . in section [ section baloons ] we will give an algebraic view on the assumption of using point masses and in section [ section sph ] we will calculate the gw signal from smoothed - particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of am cvn stars . in section [ section conclusions ]",
    "we discuss the conclusions of this study .",
    "we calculate the gw wave signal from a collection of point particles with arbitrary coordinates and masses , all rotating about a fixed point with the same angular speed @xmath0 .",
    "since the stars do not move at highly relativistic speeds we use linearised general relativity . in linearised general relativity the trace reversed metric for any non - relativistic , far away source is given by ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath1 where r is the distance from observer to the source taken as an average over the distance to all source points .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the mass and coordinates of points in the source .",
    "@xmath4 is the quadrupole moment of the source . in the transverse - traceless ( tt )",
    "gauge for a wave travelling in the z - direction , the wave has only two degrees of freedom left .",
    "they manifest themselves as so called @xmath5 and @xmath6 polarisations that can be measured by a detector .",
    "the wave metric then becomes @xcite @xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained by @xcite @xmath10 if we now take @xmath11 particles and assign them masses @xmath2 and positions in polar coordinated @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we can derive a general expression for @xmath8 and @xmath9 . also taking into account the inclination angle @xmath14 for the relative orientation of the source",
    ", we get : @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 these expressions depend only on the given initial coordinates and can easily be calculated numerically .",
    "because @xmath8 and @xmath9 have a cosine and a sine term with different amplitudes it is useful to define the average strain amplitude as : @xmath19 as we will later determine the accuracy of the point mass approximation , it is worth estimating the error we make by using the linearised theory for these systems .",
    "the first post - newtonian correction is proportional to @xmath20 ( e.g. @xcite,@xcite ) which for double white dwarf systems with orbital period of several minutes is of order @xmath21 .",
    "using equations ( [ h+ ] ) and ( [ hx ] ) we look at what we can say about the two point mass approximation algebraically .",
    "the parts of the equations that depend on the configuration of the system are @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for these expressions something very similar to the parallel axis theorem for moment of inertia can be expressed .",
    "consider a body in the @xmath24-plane with its centre of mass at the origin .",
    "its mass distribution can be described by point masses with coordinates @xmath25,@xmath26 and mass @xmath2 with respect to its own centre of mass .",
    "so @xmath22 and @xmath23 are obtained from eqs .",
    "[ s1],[s2 ] .",
    "we call these @xmath27 and @xmath28 , because these are the @xmath29 s that would arise if the body was spinning around its centre of mass .",
    "we now change the coordinates of our origin to another point in the plane such that all point masses get new coordinates @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "all coordinates denoted with subscript cm refer to the location of the body s centre of mass in the new frame and we assume the body is in circular motion around the new origin .    to do the translation we first transform to cartesian coordinates , translate and then transform back to polar coordinates .",
    "for the transform we use @xmath32 the mirror symmetry , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , relieves us from having to split the sum over particles into separate sums for positive and negative @xmath25 , allowing the new @xmath29 to be written as the old @xmath29 plus an additional term .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 s that determine the gw radiation are : @xmath35 @xmath36 i.e. a first term denoting the original @xmath27 and @xmath28 and a second displacement term that sums all mass in one point , so the change of coordinates has contributed only the effect of a point mass at the body s centre of mass .",
    "so far we have considered the case in which there is one body rotating around an arbitrary point . in the case of a binary system",
    ", the procedure can be repeated for the second star and the @xmath37 for each star now refer to the distance of the centres of the two stars to the system barycentre .",
    "we thus can conclude that , when determining @xmath38 , every body with @xmath39 can be considered as a point mass without implications to the result .",
    "these are bodies that do not radiate gw if they were only spinning around an axis through their own cm . in other words : bodies without a quadrupole moment , like axisymmetric spheres or disks .",
    "this result even holds when the body overlaps with the point it is rotating about , if that is physically possible .",
    "so only asymmetries in the stars that form a binary gw source may lead to deviations from the result as calculated using a source consisting only of two point masses .",
    "for semi - detached binaries , we know they do not consist of spherical stars . the contribution of the accretion disk will depend on if it is circular or not and on how the mass is distributed over the disk .",
    "the contribution of the donor will also depend on the mass distribution over its shape .",
    "we therefore need to look at the gw signals of more realistic mass distributions .",
    "roche lobe filling stars and accretion disks are not completely symmetric around their centres of mass . using equations ( [ h+ ] ) and",
    "( [ hx ] ) we can calculate the contribution this has to the gravitational wave signal if we know their mass distributions . for this study",
    "we use a set of sph simulations of double white dwarfs at the onset of mass transfer ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , hereafter referred to as rochesph .",
    "we sample the different mass combinations as shown in table   [ sphtable ] .",
    "an example of one star of an sph simulation is shown in fig .",
    "[ rocheplot ] in such a way that the non - axisymmetric sph particles are shown more prominently .",
    "in addition we have used an sph simulation of an accretion disc in an ultra - compact binary , kindly provided to us by prof .",
    "matt wood ( based on @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is a @xmath40 system with an accretion disk around the accretor formed by adding mass at the inner lagrange point of the roche potential with the two stars treated as point masses ( fig .",
    "[ diskplot ] ) , from here onwards referred to as the disksph .",
    "we assume the mass in the disk is @xmath21 of the mass of the accretor .",
    "all simulation results are snapshots at some point in the evolution of the binary .",
    "because of this , we can not take all movement of the system into account , so we assumed that these mass distributions rotate with fixed angular speeds around their centres of mass .",
    "now equations [ h+ ] , [ hx ] and [ strainamp ] can be used to calculate the gw strain amplitude .",
    "the differences of gw strain amplitude for the disksph and all rochesph systems compared to two point systems are listed in table [ sphtable ] .",
    "the disksph results shows a deviation at the @xmath21 level , while the rochesph results , depending on the mass of the deformed donor star and the mass ratio @xmath41 , range between 0.2 and 1.3 per cent .",
    "the results of the rochesph calculations as function of mass ratio @xmath41 and donor mass are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ rochevary ] .",
    "the deviations are largest for equal mass systems , but more interesting , our results clearly show the fact that lower donor masses are more deformed than more massive donors at the same mass ratio .",
    ".[sphtable]ratio of gw strain amplitude of sph systems and two point mass systems .",
    "the mass of the accretion disk in disksph was taken to be @xmath42 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to explore the influence of an accretion disk in somewhat more detail , we varied the mass of the accretion disk compared to the mass in the two stars ( fig .",
    "[ diskvary ] ) .",
    "as can be expected , the deviation from the point mass approximation scales linearly with the disk mass , which has to be unrealistically high ( 1 per cent of the total mass ) in order to get near the effect of the deformed donor star discussed above . the deviation for a system with roche - lobe filling donor plus",
    "an accretion disk is approximately the sum of the rochesph and disksph result ( see above ) and thus for realistic disk masses is dominated by the deformation of the donor .",
    "we have calculated the deviation of the gravitational wave signal of finite size and non - spherical white dwarfs to that of point masses , which is usually assumed . for any finite size , non - relativistic axisymmetric body in circular orbit ,",
    "the result is exactly the same . for semi - detached white dwarf binaries",
    ", we find that an accretion disk of reasonable mass changes the gravitational wave signal at the level of @xmath43 to @xmath44 , small but still significantly larger than errors due to the neglect of post - newtonian corrections in the calculation of the signal .",
    "deformations due to filling the roche lobe of semi - detached binaries increase for mass ratios closer to unity for fixed donor mass and are distinctly stronger at fixed mass ratio for lower mass donors and can in the most extreme cases be of order 1 per cent .",
    "this in principle will change the frequency evolution and the accuracy with which the parameters can be determined ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , so calculations in which accuracies of better than one per cent are needed should take the finite size into account . also , the different strength of the gravitational wave angular momentum losses will affect the mass transfer rate and stability of the mass transfer in semi - detached systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the level of deviation we found shows that the calculations presented in the literature on the expected signals of ( verification ) binaries for lisa , are essentially unaffected : for monochromatic sources , the amplitude of the signal will be slightly different , but indistinguishable from sources with slightly higher ( chirp ) masses and/or smaller distances , properties that are much more uncertain than one per cent . for systems with measurable period derivatives ,",
    "the degeneracy between ( chirp ) mass and distance is broken , but the deviations we found can still only be detected if there is independent extremely accurate measurement of the ( chirp ) mass of the binary . for a lisa - like detector such independent mass estimates , if available , are typically accurate at the 10 per cent level at best ( e.g. @xcite ) . the detailed evolution ( and possible merger of the system ) will be affected as well , but the calculations of this phase ( e.g. @xcite ) already take the finite size of the stars into account .",
    "we therefore conclude that in the majority of cases , the use of the point mass approximation is well justified .",
    "we thank matt wood for sharing the results of his sph simulations with us and the anonymous referee for comments that greatly improved the paper .",
