    "waves and wave behavior are ubiquitous .",
    "examples are acoustic waves in matter , electromagnetic waves , and physical particles in the quantum mechanical regime . thus understanding wave behavior is important in many different fields ; systems which are radically different physically can often be represented by the same mathematics .",
    "the simplest model of wave behavior is the helmholtz equation , @xmath0 which typically must be supplemented with boundary conditions .",
    "equation   describes many physical situations exactly ( such as acoustic waves within a homogeneous , linear , bulk medium or quantum particles in free space ) .",
    "inhomogeneous situations con often be modelled by eq .   with @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a function of position .",
    "if the system has loss or gain , @xmath3 can be allowed to become complex .",
    "driving terms can be added to represent transducers or ports . in this paper , we focus on scalar waves described by eq .   with constant @xmath3 ,",
    "but the results generalize well to many other wave problems .    unfortunately , for all but the simplest of geometries , eq .",
    "is analytically intractable .",
    "thus techniques , both numerical and theoretical , have been developed to solve eq .  .",
    "these techniques and their effectiveness vary depending on the regime and physical scenario one wishes to study . in this paper , we limit ourself to the semiclassical regime ; i.e. , the regime in which the wavelength of the waves excited in the system is much shorter than the scattering elements in the system . in this limit ,",
    "it is known ( via the correspondence principle from quantum mechanics ) that the resulting dynamics are closely related to the trajectories a classical particle would take through the system .",
    "this analogy applies even to purely classical waves , such as waves on the surface of water where the role of classical particle dynamics is now replaced by the dynamical evolution of ray trajectories . in this paper , we consider only those systems in which the corresponding classical dynamics is purely chaotic ( i.e. , all classical trajectories which start infinitesimally far apart diverge exponentially in time ) .",
    "in addition , we focus on the scattering properties of such systems , assuming that the system of interest is a closed cavity that couples to the outside world only via well - defined localized channels",
    ".    the scattering properties of such wave systems have been well studied , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , in a wide variety of contexts .",
    "much of the the theory has focused on the frequency domain , and sophisticated techniques exist to analyze and characterize the scattering process .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "similarly , the time domain response of typical wave systems to a delta - function impulse has also been considered @xcite , especially in relationship to fidelity decay(for an overview of fidelity decay , see the ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we consider an intermediate situation : we excite the wave system , through an external port with a pulse modulated sinusoidal signal , exciting a large but finite number of modes .",
    "the problem of scattering pulse - modulated sinusoidal waves arises in a host of diagnostic situations , such as radar , sonar , nuclear scattering , etc . in what follows , for specificity",
    ", we discuss our problem in the context of electromagnetic waves . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only lossless two - dimensional microwave cavities excited through a small antenna .",
    "we emphasize that the results we obtain can be generalized to higher - dimensional systems and to quantum mechanical or other wave - chaotic systems(e.g . , acoustic or elastic wave systems ) .    on a formal level ,",
    "the time domain dynamics of such a system is straightforward .",
    "the system is open and linear .",
    "an incident pulse with a small but finite width in the time domain excites a large number of modes in the cavity , which then radiate their energy back out through the port . because the system is linear , the reflected voltage can be expressed as a superposition of contributions from modes of the open system .",
    "the chaotic dynamics is expressed , not through the dynamics of the individual modes , but rather in the eigenvalue statistics @xcite and the statistics of the coupling between the port and the cavity .    as showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , the contribution from each mode decays exponentially in time . for short times compared with the heisenberg time",
    "( the inverse of the mean spacing of mode frequencies ) , the resulting dynamics will be determined primarily by the semiclassical dynamics within the cavity @xcite .",
    "however , for large times compared with the heisenberg time , the ensemble average of the reflected power decreases as a power law in time @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that there is a probability distribution of mode decay rates which extends to zero decay rate , and for long times the average is dominated by modes with very small decay rates . in the case of a single realization of the chaotic cavity , the incident pulse excites a large number of modes with very similar amplitudes , and consequently the reflected power initially behaves as though the sum of modes were an ensemble average , and the total power decays as a power law .",
    "we call this behavior self - averaging . in a single specific realization , however , there are only a finite number of modes excited .",
    "eventually the slowest - decaying mode in the realization will be much larger than the other modes , and the sum will be dominated by this slowest mode , which decays exponentially .",
    "thus for extremely long times we expect that the reflected power for any single realization will fall exponentially , eventually becoming much smaller than the ensemble average .    to test this hypothesis , we have created a program that models the time - domain behavior of generic chaotic systems .",
    "it does this by first generating the spectrum and coupling constants of a cavity using the previously published @xcite random coupling model ( rcm ) and then integrating the evolution equations for fields in the cavity , which are modelled in the rcm as a set of driven , damped coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "single realizations of the power reflected from these cavities , as well as the ensemble average of 50 different cavities , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single_realizations ] , where we show two very different realizations : one ( fig .",

    "[ fig : single_realizations](b ) ) in which self - averaging occurs early , but becomes dominated by solitary slowly decaying modes before the conclusion of the numerical simulation .",
