    "a lattice animal is a cluster of connected sites on a regular lattice .",
    "the enumeration of such objects  also called polyominoes  is a combinatorial problem of interest to mathematicians @xcite , while in physics , they are closely linked to the problems of percolation @xcite and clustering in spin models @xcite . in chemistry",
    "they form a basis for models of randomly branched polymers in good solvents @xcite .",
    "lattice animals linked by translations are considered as belonging to the same equivalence class , and as such are considered to be essentially the same . of interest",
    "is @xmath1 , the number of distinct animals containing @xmath2 sites .",
    "a related objective is the calculation of the radius of gyration @xmath3 , related to the average distance of occupied sites from the centre of mass of the lattice animal .",
    "a number of variants of the lattice animal are studied : bond lattice animals , which are clusters of connected bonds ; weakly embedded and strongly embedded trees .",
    "it is believed that all these different models belong to the same universality class @xcite .",
    "it is now established that the number of lattice animals and the radius of gyration behave , to leading order in @xmath2 , as @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is related to the rate of growth of @xmath1 and @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hausdorff ( fractal ) dimension of the lattice animals .",
    "it is useful to define the generating function ( or grand - canonical partition function ) for the model as @xmath8 the growth constant @xmath9 is related to the critical fugacity @xmath10 defining the radius of convergence of the generating function ( [ gen_func ] ) . to leading order , @xmath11 giving the identification @xmath12 .",
    "the growth constant @xmath9 is related to the critical fugacity of the corresponding field theory and depends on the lattice coordination number , while the entropic exponent @xmath5 and the correlation - length exponent @xmath13 are universal @xcite .",
    "lattice animals may be viewed as the graphs arising from high - temperature expansions of related magnetic models , in particular the high temperature expansion of ( the derivative of ) the free energy of the @xmath14 potts models , which in turn is related to the percolation problem .",
    "parisi and sourlas related the problem of branched polymers , and hence lattice animals , in @xmath15 dimension with the yang - lee edge problem in @xmath16 dimension , and predicted that @xmath5 and @xmath13 are related by @xcite @xmath17 this relation was re - derived in an interesting fashion @xcite : identifying @xmath18 as the high - temperature expansion of a magnetic model leads to the identification of @xmath19 with the magnetic and thermal scaling fields of the related magnetic model , indicating that the lattice animal is controlled by a single scaling field .",
    "this leads to the relations @xmath20 .",
    "the exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the usual critical indices related to the divergence of the specific heat and susceptibility of the related potts model .",
    "substituting the mean - field exponents into the usual hyperscaling relation @xmath23 would lead to an upper critical dimension of @xmath24 , whereas the correct upper critical dimension is @xmath25 , indicating that there is an anomalous scaling and that hyperscaling is modified , with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath16 : @xmath26 and eq.([ps ] ) is recovered .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the parisi - sourlas predictions for the leading behaviour for both eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) were verified in dimensions @xmath27 to @xmath28 using a high - statistics numerical study with lattice animals with up to several thousand sites in each case .",
    "the measured values of @xmath5 and @xmath13 were compatible with the parisi - sourlas scaling relation .",
    "although experimentally inaccessible , a complete understanding of the lattice - animal problem includes the upper critical dimension @xmath0 . at and above this dimension",
    ", the critical exponents take on the mean - field values @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite . in eight dimensions ,",
    "the scaling forms ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections .",
    "indeed , in the high - precision study of ref .",
    "@xcite , very large corrections to eqs.([1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) were reported in eight dimensions .",
    "while it was presumed that these corrections are logarithmic in nature , no attempt at a detailed fit to them was made because the authors were unaware of theoretical predictions beyond the leading order , and because of the notorious difficulty in fitting to such logarithms .",
    "it is expected that at the upper critical dimension @xmath31 , @xmath1 and @xmath3 scale as @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the values of the logarithmic correction exponents @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the subject of the present article .",
    "the mean - field exponents for the lattice animal model correspond to the exponents calculated from a @xmath37 theory with reduced temperature @xmath38 and where the reduced magnetic field @xmath39 is used as a temperature - like variable .",
    "this is consistent with the realisation , stated above , that in this model there is only one scaling field , linked to the magnetic field of the underlying magnetic model .",
    "the full set of mean - field exponents are @xmath40 these exponents are related by fisher renormalisation to the standard mean - field exponents obtained setting @xmath41 and varying @xmath42 .",
    "these fisher - renormalised exponents are @xmath43 whilst in the lattice animal model there is only a single scaling field ( @xmath39 ) , in the equivalent yang - lee model it is possible to vary both @xmath42 and @xmath39 independently .",
    "this pairing via fisher renormalisation and scaling relations have permitted new analytic predictions for the logarithmic corrections @xcite : @xmath44 , consistent with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath45 .",
    "the latter differs from a previous renormalisation - group based prediction : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we therefore considered it worthwhile to revisit the problem of lattice animals in @xmath0 dimensions in an attempt to discern whether the numerics support either of these analytic predictions for logarithmic corrections .    in",
    "what follows we find numerical support for logarithmically - corrected scaling behaviour in eight dimensions , with @xmath44 . although the numerics for the radius of gyration yield less convincing results , they appear more compatible with the value @xmath45 predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite than @xmath46 predicted in ref .",
    "while the leading exponents @xmath5 and @xmath13 in eqs.([3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) are not in doubt , there are two sets of predictions in the literature for their logarithmic - correction counterparts @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in ref .  @xcite ,",
    "ruiz - lorenzo analytically studied these and other logarithmic corrections for a generic @xmath37 scalar field theory at its upper critical dimension @xmath47 .",
    "this theory , with imaginary coupling , is known to describe the yang - lee problem @xcite .",
    "the latter originates from the study of the yang - lee edge singularity , which may be regarded as a critical or pseudo - critical point .",
    "parisi and sourlas advanced a relationship between the yang - lee singularity in @xmath48 dimensions and the lattice - animal problem in @xmath49 dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently , an exact mapping between the two problems established this relationship on a rigorous footing  @xcite . the renormalisation - group calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite for the yang - lee problem ( @xmath37 theory with imaginary coupling ) in @xmath47 dimensions yields a free energy as a function of the magnetic field , the singular part of which is of the form @xmath50 the grand canonical partition function for the lattice animals is @xmath51 where , with @xmath1 given by eq.([4 ] ) , scales as @xmath52 the parisi - sourlas mapping , then , identifies eq.([rlf ] ) for the yang - lee problem with eq.([zz ] ) for the lattice animals , with the magnetic field in the former case being replaced by the fugacity in the latter .",
    "this leads to the predictions @xmath30 and @xmath44 for the lattice - animal problem in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite , which are supported by previous direct calculations @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37-approach also leads to analytic predictions for the correlation length , @xmath53 which translates to @xmath54 and @xmath46 for lattice animals .",
    "the lattice animal and yang - lee problems can be considered either with the field or the order parameter held constant , with constant field being the more natural in field theory @xcite .",

    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , ruiz - lorenzo has also determined the constant - order - parameter critical exponents and , in particular , the constant - order - parameter logarithmic - correction exponent for the correlation - length is given as @xmath55 @xcite . applying the fisher - renormalization relations from ref .",
    "@xcite with this value yields the prediction @xmath56 , which is _ different _ to the constant - field estimate @xmath46 quoted above .    to summarize , the renormalization - group approach of ref .",
    "@xcite yields constant - field estimates for the leading entopic and flory critical exponents which agree with mean - field , have been checked numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite and which are not in doubt .",
    "the corresponding logarithmic exponents are @xmath44 and @xmath46 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , constant - order - parameter estimates are also given , which , when fisher renormalized also yield @xmath44 but @xmath45 . while all leading exponents and ruiz - lorenzo s rg calculations for the @xmath37 theory agree with mean - field predictions , and while calculations for the logarithmic - correction exponents agree with all previous estimates where they exist ( besides the yang - lee problem , these include for spin glasses and for percolation in six dimensions ) , the disparity between the estimates for @xmath36 requires further investigation and we chose a non - perturbative , numerical approach .",
    "it is also necessary to check if @xmath44 is supported numerically , as this has not been tested non - perturbatively before .",
    "the numerical data was obtained using the prune - enriched rosenbluth method ( perm ) which is a variant of the rosenbluth - rosenbluth monte carlo method for self - avoiding walks designed to avoid the ensembles being dominated by a few high weight clusters and to avoid undue time being used calculating clusters with small weights @xcite .",
    "this is avoided by reducing the width of the weights distribution by pruning low - weight configurations while cloning high - weight ones . to apply this approach to lattice animals",
