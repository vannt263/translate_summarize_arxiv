    "in spite of the exciting progresses carried out recently , the central engine that powers gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains unknown .",
    "following the detection of an absorption system in the optical spectrum of the optical transient ( ot ) related to the gamma - ray burst grb 970508 ( metzger et al .",
    "1997 ) , it is believed now that most grbs , if not all , arise at cosmological distances",
    ". however , the mechanism responsible for the emission is not yet known , and it could be still possible the existence of recurrent transient optical emission .",
    "if this is the case , archival searches are extremely important , because they will allow to search for the possible recurrent optical emission .",
    "the detection of optical transient emission for grb 970228 ( van paradijs et al .",
    "1997 , guarnieri et al . 1997 ) and grb 970508 ( bond 1997 , djorgovski et al .",
    "1997 , castro - tirado et al . 1998 ) confirms this fact .",
    "however , for some other bursts no optical emission was detected although prompt and deep follow up observations were carried out ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1997 , groot et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "several ots have been already found by means of archival searches . however , the confirmation of optical recurrent emission associated to grbs is still unclear . among them , ot 1901 , ot 1928 and ot 1944 ( schaefer 1981 , schaefer et al .",
    "1984 ) are located inside small grb error boxes .",
    "for instance ot 1928 is a prominent object 5.8 mag over the plate limit , within a  8 arcmin@xmath1 error box .",
    "but the reality of these objects has been under debate ( ytkow 1990 , hudec et al .",
    "other firm candidates are the three objects found by hudec et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , at the same position of the sky .",
    "they are well above the plate limit and the structure is compatible with a star - like object in all three cases .",
    "however , they are outside the grb 790325b error box .    moskalenko s object ( ot 1959 , moskalenko et al .",
    "1989 ) was found inside the grb 791101 error box as a 13 mag stellar image ( or 6.6 mag if a 1-s flash is assumed ) on two different plates ( b and v filters ) taken simultaneously .",
    "a double exposure can not be ruled out because both plates were taken with cameras on the same mount .",
    "moreover , the low quality and the steepness of the image profile cast doubts about the reality of the object ( greiner and moskalenko 1994 ) .",
    "the ot reported by greiner et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , represents one of the best candidates detected so far .",
    "it was found on three plates taken simultaneously in 1966 in the grb 781006b error box .",
    "the magnitudes of the objects are similar to moskalenko s one , at @xmath2 mag ( or 6.3 mag if a 1-s flash is assumed ) .",
    "although some preliminary explanations were given ( asteroids , satellite glints , head - on meteors , aircraft air lights or a dwarf nova ) , spectroscopic observations provided evidence that the ot was due to a large amplitude flaring dme star , probably unrelated to the grb ( greiner and motch 1995 ) .",
    "the only ot found near - simultaneous to a grb event , is the one reported by borovicka et al .",
    "they found a star - like object at the edge of the grb 790929 error box on a plate taken only 7.1 h after the high energy event .",
    "also , two additional objects were found at the same position on another plates .",
    "the objects are consistent with the star hde 249119 , but are relatively faint ( at the utmost 1 mag above the plate limit ) , so a plate fault or a grain cumulation can not be completely excluded .",
    "further optical studies detected additional optical eruptions of hde 249119 , reporting ten optical brightenings with amplitudes greater than 0.5 mag ( stpn and hudec 1996 ) .    besides the above - mentioned ot candidates , hudec et al .",
    "( 1994b ) reported the presence of a very bright ot ( 5 mag above the plate limit ) inside grb 910219 watch/_granat _ error box ( sazonov et al .",
    "1998 ) coincident with the position of a confirmed quasar with redshift z=1.78 ( vrba et al .",
    "however the position of the object is not consistent with the small error box derived by the third interplanetary network ( hereafter ipn , hurley 1997 ) .",
    "more recently hudec et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reported two ots that may be connected to grb 910522 and grb 920406 . in the former case",
    "the ot seems to be related to a dme flare star whereas a quiet counterpart with colours consistent with a quasar / agn was found in the second one .",
    "other ot candidates have been found ( scholz 1984 , greiner and flohrer 1985 , flohrer et al .",
    "1986 , greiner et al .",
    "1987 , hudec et al .",
    "1987 , hudec et al . 1988 ) but none of them can be conclusively proven as a real ot . therefore , despite strong efforts carried out during the last two decades there is no a convincing prove that ots found in plate archives and grbs are related to the same physical phenomenon .",
    "comprehensive reviews on ots found so far can be seen in hudec et al .",
    "( 1993a , 1993b , 1994c , 1995 ) .",
    "the most recent archival search has been performed by gorosabel and castro - tirado  ( 1998a ) .",
    "they have examined 8004 plates at the harvard college observatory plate collection searching for optical transient emission from the gamma - ray burst grb 970228 .",
    "this has been the first archival search carried out so far for a gamma - ray burst with known transient optical emission .",
    "the total exposure time amounted to @xmath3 yr .",
    "no convincing optical activity has been found above @xmath4 mag at the expected position of the grb 970228 optical counterpart .",

    "the content of the @xmath5 astrometrical error circle is shown in fig .",
    "4 . magnitudes and positions of all objects are displayed in table 6 .",
    "photometrical errors in the magnitudes are overestimated due to the presence of several bad ccd columns .",
    "object # 1 seems to be the most interesting object within the 1@xmath6 error circle , with u @xmath7 , b = @xmath8 , v = @xmath9 , r = @xmath10 , i = @xmath11 .",
    "the colours are consistent with that of a k7/m0 dwarf star or a k5/m1 giant , although they could be also consistent with a reddened galaxy ( see fig  5 ) .",
    "the object on plate am 24589 appears to be @xmath12 mag over the plate limit and is absent on plate am 24592 ( obtained 3 hours and 5 minutes after ) .",
    "therefore , the object should have declined at a rate of @xmath13 mag / hr , which is similar to same decline rates in flares stars . could object # 1 be classified as a flare star ? .    to estimate",
    "the probability of having a k7/m0 dwarf star or a k5/m1 giant coincident with the 1@xmath6 astrometrical error is difficult because of various statistical biases in star catalogues .",
    "taking into account the number of stars per square degree of magnitude b=22 at galactic latitude @xmath14 and the fraction of k7/m0 spectral - type main sequence and k5/m1 giant stars ( allen 1973 ) , we expect @xmath15 k7/m0 main sequence stars and @xmath16 k5/m1 giants within a @xmath17 error circle ( the size of the 1@xmath6 astrometrical error radius ) .",
    "therefore , in the absence of stronger constraints we can not prove that this star has caused the object detected on the plate am 24589 .",
    "considering that in the solar neighbourhood the fraction of m0-m1 type stars that can be considered as flare stars is  5% ( shakhovskaya 1994 , mirzoyan 1994 ) , the probability that a m0-m1 flare star is located by chance inside the 1@xmath6 astrometrical error would be @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , if object # 1 was a flare star , it is likely to be the responsible of the object found on the plate am 24589 . in this case",
    ", the flare amplitude would be @xmath19 mag which is slightly higher than the extreme flares of the cz cnc stars ( greiner and motch 1994 , toth et al .",
    "it should be noted that m flare stars have been found at ots position inside two grb error boxes ( greiner and motch 1995 , hudec et al .",
    "in any case an optical spectrum would be desirable in order to clarify its nature .",
    "ots have been found at the edge or slightly outside grb error boxes , like grb 910219 ( hudec et al .",
    "1994b ) , grb 790325b ( hudec et al .",
    "1990 ) or grb 791006b ( greiner et al .",
    "in fact several authors suggest a strong relationship between quasars and ots ( vrba et al .",
    "1994 , hudec et al .",
    "1997 ) , but statistical studies do not show a convincing correlation between quasars and grbs ( gorosabel et al .",
    "1995 , schartel et al .",
    "1997 , gorosabel and castro - tirado 1998b , gorosabel and castro tirado 1998c , hurley et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the object is inside the watch error circle ( sazonov et al . 1998 ) , but @xmath20 outside the improved ipn error box for grb 910122 ( hurley et al .",
    "1997 ) and not included in any of the three annuli determined by the _ granat _ , _ pvo _ and _ ulysses _ spacecraft .",
    "even if we assume an extended halo radius equal to 150  kpc and a high - velocity neutron star ( at 1000  km / s ) , its apparent motion on the sky would be only @xmath0 0.14  in 100 yr .",
    "therefore , theories based on high - speed neutron stars in the halo will not allow to place the optical source that far away the ipn error box ( li and dermer 1992 ) .",
    "the maximum allowable distance to detect such proper motion of @xmath20 in 46 yr ( from 1945 to 1991 ) would be 35 pc , but such a nearby neutron star would have been easily detected in previous all - sky x - ray surveys .",
    "therefore we can set a lower limit of 0.55 yr for any recurrent optical transient activity ( above 14.1 mag ) related to grb 910122 .",
    "this can be compared with the 2.1 yr in the case of grb 910219 ( hudec et al .",
    "further results on the optical content of the grb 910122 ipn error box will be published elsewhere ( gorosabel , castro - tirado and lund 1998 ) .",
    "we have examined @xmath0 3995 plates at hco for grb 910122 covering @xmath0 0.55 yr .",
    "no convincing evidence of optical transient emission was found within the grb 910122 error box .",
    "additional plates at roe did not show any suspicious object either .",
    "however , a possible ot was found at hco on the plate am 24589 , located @xmath20 outside the improved error box provided by the ipn .",
    "multicolour optical observations were carried out , finding 3 sources consistent , within the @xmath21 object astrometrical error box .",
    "one of them shows colours typical of a m dwarf star or a reddened galaxy . in any case",
    "it seems to be unrelated to the grb because of its location outside the ipn error box .",
