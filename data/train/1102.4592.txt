    "the inside edge of the _ ne radio ridge _ coincides with an optical spiral arm , but the @xmath2 cm  radio emission spreads significantly beyond the outer edge of this arm into the interarm and is brighter in the interarm .    a question is whether the _ ne radio ridge _ is located in the thin disk of ngc 2207 or in a thick disk or in the halo on the back side of ngc 2207 ( relative to us ) between the two galaxies .",
    "if the _ ne radio ridge _ lies in the disk of ngc 2207 , it makes sense to discuss the ridge contrast ( defined as the ridge - to - interarm radio disk at the inside edge of the ridge ) . at the 2.5  ( 425 pc ) resolution of our high resolution @xmath2 cm  radio continuum image , the shock width is somewhat resolved ; going to higher resolution would probably not increase the ridge contrast by a significant factor . along the inside edge of the _ ne radio ridge _ ,",
    "the interarm radio disk is detected at a level of about @xmath83 the rms noise in this image .",
    "along much of this radio ridge from pa = 102  clockwise to 32 , the ridge contrast in surface brightness is greater than 4 and reaches a maximum of 10 at h i  massive cloud n6 . in the case of a strong non - cooling shock transverse to the magnetic field , the shock would increase the magnetic field @xmath29 by a factor of 4 . if equipartition or minimum energy or pressure equilibrium of cosmic - ray electrons and magnetic @xmath29 field applies ( see , for example ,",

    "this is somewhat greater than the observed ridge contrast of 4 to 10 .",
    "this limiting case is more likely to apply in the halo than in the thin disk .",
    "we conclude that if the _ ne radio ridge _ is in the disk , it is a broad ridge of somewhat compressed magnetic field , not a strong mhd shock .",
    "however , if the _ ne radio ridge _ is high off the midplane , then taking the measured ratio of the radio surface brightness on the _ ne radio ridge _ to that of the interarm thin disk at its inside edge does not make sense , and thus a strong mhd shock may be allowed .",
    "the following comparison between the distributions of @xmath2 cm  radio continuum emission , neutral gas , and cool dust in this system provides information relevant to the question of whether the _ ne radio ridge _ is in the disk . in ngc 2207 , the distribution of 70  emission ( see figure[20cm-70micron ] ) and the distributions of 160  emission @xcite and @xmath11co @xmath12  emission measured at sest @xcite generally correspond with the spiral arms .",
    "this indicates that molecular gas and the cool dust are cool fluids in the thin disk .",

    "more importantly , unlike the radio continuum , the h i  emission from the _ ne radio ridge _ is no brighter than from the opposite side of ngc 2207 .",
    "this may be understood if a substantial fraction of the radio continuum emission in the _ ne radio ridge _ originates in the halo .    on scales greater than about 2 kpc in normal spiral galaxies ,",
    "@xcite find that the ratio of @xmath11co @xmath12   intensity to radio continuum surface brightness is fairly constant .",

    "if the compressed magnetic field is in the halo and there is little neutral gas in the halo , then it is easy to understand why the _ ne radio ridge _ is not a site of extended vigorous star formation .",

    "feature i_. at the _ feature i _ positions sampled by these two long slits , photoionization dominates , and these optical spectra show no components in _ feature i _ at supernova or jet velocities .",
    "since photoionization dominates the optical spectra whereas the radio emission is nonthermal , we interpret _ feature i _ as a mini - starburst and compare it with the central starburst in m82 .",
    "the central @xmath158 starburst in m82 has @xmath65(6 cm ) equal to @xmath159 jy @xcite , a radio spectral index @xmath4 of 0.5 , and outflow over a wide range of solid angle @xcite .",
    "if the m82 central starburst were at the 35 mpc distance of ngc 2207 instead of 3.6 mpc , it would have a major axis of @xmath160 ( a little smaller than _ feature i _ ) and @xmath65(6 cm ) = 36 mjy , which is 7.7 times the @xmath2 cm  flux density of _ feature i _ as a whole .",
    "except in the 1  core of _ feature i _ , the @xmath2 cm  radiation field in _ feature i _ is significantly less intense than the average value for the m82 starburst .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath65(24 ) /@xmath65(6",
    "cm ) of the central starburst in m82 for comparison with _ feature i_. with a 25  aperture centered on the m82 starburst ,",
    "@xcite measured @xmath65(22 ) = 120 jy . extrapolating to 24  by taking @xmath161 gives @xmath65(24 ) = 130 jy for a 25  aperture .",
    "for the 50  extent of the radio emission from the m82 starburst , @xmath65(24 ) should be somewhat greater than 130 jy , and thus @xmath65(24 ) /@xmath65(6",
    "cm ) should be somewhat greater than 130 jy/3.4 jy = 38 .",
    "it appears that the ratio @xmath65(24 ) /@xmath65(6",
    "cm ) = 53 for _ feature i _ is not unusual for a dusty starburst region .",
    "the upper left panel in figure[featuri_images ] displays contours of the x - ray emission from source x2 .",
    "the core of _ feature i _ is not detected as an x - ray source .",
    "the absence of soft x - rays could be the result of the high absorption seen from comparison of the @xmath1 and 8  images .",
    "the x - ray emission is generally south and sse of _ feature i _ , and the brightest x - ray knot is centered 2.4north of sn 1999ec .",
    "the upper right panel in this figure shows that the @xmath1 peak emission coincides with the supernova .",
    "as previously reported by @xcite from an archival search of type ib , c supernovae which used our _ xmm - newton _  observations of ngc 2207 , it seems likely that most of the x - ray emission from x2 is associated with the type ib supernova sn 1999ec .",
    "it is unusual for a type ib supernova to be seen as an x - ray source , and , interestingly , sn 1999ec is bright in x - rays 6 years after the optical sn was discovered",
    ". the x - ray emission may be from the supernova shock plowing into a circumstellar envelope .",
    "this makes it more plausible that the bright @xmath1 emission coinciding with sn 1999ec is due to shock excitation of circumstellar gas by the supernova .",
    "the x - ray spectral index of x2 is steeper than typical of an x - ray binary .",
    "we presented the x - ray and uv data observed by _ xmm - newton _  and new @xmath2 cm  radio continuum observations of the interacting galaxies ngc 2207/ic 2163 . when combined with our previous observations in h@xmath4 , _ hst _ @xmath29-band , _ spitzer _ infrared , h i , and _ sest _",
    "@xmath12 , these data allow us to see the effects of the grazing encounter in producing large scale shocks , to study star complexes , supernovae , and the galactic nuclei in this pair , and to identify possible ulx candidates .    in x - rays",
    "we detect the nucleus of ngc 2207 , nine possible ulx candidates , and extended x - ray emission , mainly from ngc 2207 .",
    "one of the discrete x - ray sources corresponds to sn 1999ec and another has brightened in the radio in recent years and could be a radio supernova or a background quasar .",
    "the bright @xmath1 and x - ray emission from sn 1999ec may be from shock excitation of circumstellar gas by the supernova .",
    "the strongest source in our _ xmm - newton _  x - ray observations of ngc 2207/ ic 2163 is the nucleus of ngc 2207 .",
    "it is the only hard x - ray source in the field .",
    "the preferred model for its x - ray spectrum is a power law with a partial covering absorber .",
    "most likely this is a strongly absorbed , low - luminosity , seyfert 2 agn . however , optical spectroscopy is needed to confirm this assumption .",
    "we measured values of the ratio of 8  to @xmath2 cm  radio continuum flux density for the prominent , kpc - sized , star - forming clumps in the galaxy pair and compared them with those for the m81 h ii  regions whose radio continuum is dominated by optically - thin free - free emission . for the bright clumps in ngc 2207 , the mean value of this ratio equals 18 , which is the same as for giant radio h ii  regions in m81 , within the uncertainties . for the bright clumps on the rim ( the _ eyelids _ ) of the eye - shaped oval in ic 2163 , the mean value is nearly a factor of two greater .",
    "there are two types of large - scale fronts in this galaxy pair : the _ eyelids _ of the eye - shaped oval in ic 2163 and the _ ne radio ridge _ on the companion side of ngc 2207 .",
    "the _ eyelid _",
    "shock front is produced by radial inflow and convergence of orbits and has vigorous star formation in a dusty environment .",
    "in the _ eyelids _ the ratio of 8  to @xmath2 cm  surface brightness is appreciably greater than in the m81 giant h ii  regions .",
    "this could be the result of heating mainly by @xmath29 stars instead of @xmath71 stars and/or fragmentation of dust grains by collisions in the shock region and formation of more pah molecules close to the @xmath74 stars .",
    "the _ eyelids _ are located behind the outer part of ngc 2207 ; this may explain why they are not bright in extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "the _ ne radio ridge _ in ngc 2207 is particularly bright in the radio continuum but not in any of the tracers of recent star formation .",
    "values of the ratios of 8  to @xmath2 cm  surface brightness and 24  to @xmath2 cm  surface brightness are low on the _ ne radio ridge _ compared to those of the m81 h ii  regions . unlike the bright radio ridge in the outer part of ngc 2276 , the _ ne radio ridge _",
    "is not enhanced in extended x - ray emission relative to the rest of galaxy ; this is probably because it is not a site of active star formation . the _ ne radio ridge _ ,",
    "which previous models attributed to disk or halo scraping , is simply due to compression of the magnetic field and may be mainly in the halo on the back side of ngc 2207 ( between the two galaxies ) .",
    "if the bright radio continuum emission from the _ ne radio ridge _ originates high off the disk of ngc 2207 in a region with little neutral gas , that would explain the lack of widespread vigorous star formation and the lack of unusually compressed h i  column density contours on the _ ne radio ridge_.    for ngc 2207/ic 2163 , the global values of the ratios of infrared to radio continuum flux density in the _ spitzer _ 8 , 24 , and 70  bands and the iras fir are significantly below the medians / means for large samples of galaxies .",
    "this is the result of excess radio continuum emission from large portions of ngc 2207 , not just the _ ne radio ridge_.    we find evidence that a radio supernova was present in the core of _ feature i _ in 2001 .",
    "if so , then ngc 2207 had two optical supernovae and one radio supernova in recent years .",
    "the @xmath2 cm  radio continuum luminosity of _ feature i _ on an outer arm of ngc 2207 is 13% of the central starburst in m82 . in linear size , _ feature i _ is a little larger than the m82 starburst . like the m82 starburst ,",
    "_ feature i _ is a dusty starburst region with radio continuum emission that is mainly nonthermal and with a 24  to @xmath2 cm  flux density ratio somewhat greater than the mean value for the m81 giant h ii  regions . whereas the m82 starburst has outflow perpendicular to the disk which is bright in x - rays , our only indication of outflow perpendicular to the disk in _ feature i _ is the peculiar morphology of the dust structures .",
