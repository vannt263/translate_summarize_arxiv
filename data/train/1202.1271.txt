    "the collision and merger of two black holes is presently considered to be an important astrophysical configuration where processes of generation and emission of gravitational waves take place ( cf.@xcite and references therein ) . the radiative transfer involved in these processes , evaluated in the full nonlinear regime of general relativity , shows that gravitational waves extract mass , momentum and angular momentum of the source , and may turn out to be fundamental for the astrophysics of the collapse of stars and the formation and population of black holes in galaxies@xcite .",
    "in this vein we have recently examined numerically the gravitational wave production and related radiative processes , as mass - energy and momentum extraction by gravitational waves , in a general collision of two schwarzschild black holes@xcite , described in the realm of non - axisymmetric robinson - trautman ( rt ) spacetimes@xcite .",
    "characteristic initial data that represent two instantaneously boosted black holes in non head - on collisions were constructed for the rt dynamics .",
    "the initial data already present a common apparent horizon so that the dynamics covers the post - merger phase of the system .",
    "the present paper focuses on the processes of momentum extraction by contemplating the time behavior of the momentum fluxes of the gravitational wave emitted and the associated total impulses imparted to the binary merged system .",
    "our treatment is based on the bondi - sachs energy momentum conservation laws@xcite .",
    "the use of the bondi - sachs formulation gives a clear and simple picture of the kick processes generated in the recoil of the the binary merged system which are related to the maximum impulse due to the gravitational wave flux in each regime characterized by the initial data .",
    "the kick processes and associated recoils in the merger of two black holes have been investigated within several approaches , all of them connected to binary black hole inspirals .",

    "is given in @xcite .",
    "the first fully numerical verification of the recoil in nonspinning black hole binaries was reported by baker et al.@xcite for a mass ratio @xmath11 of the two black holes .",

    "recently rezzola et al.@xcite obtained an important injective relation between the kick velocities and the effective curvature parameter of the global apparent horizon , in head - on collisions of two black holes in rt dynamics using initial data derived in refs .",
    "some features of a non head - on collision are distinct from those of a head - on collision@xcite or from the merger of inspiral nonspinning binaries , mainly for large values of the initial mass ratio parameter and of the incidence angle of collision of the two initial colliding black holes .",
    "one of them is the nonzero net momentum flux carried out by gravitational waves in the case of equal - mass initial colliding black holes .",
    "our results will be compared with previous estimates of black hole kicks from full numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole inspirals ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of kick processes and the magnitude of the associated recoil velocities can have important consequences for astrophysical scenarios , as the evolution and the population of massive black holes in galaxies or in the intergalactic medium@xcite . observational evidence of black hole recoils have been reported in @xcite and references therein .",

    "furthermore @xmath225 for all @xmath1 ( cf . table 1 ) , which is not physically satisfactory since the deceleration regime is dominant in the post - merger phase for all initial data parameters .",
    "the reason for these discrepancies is that the velocity variable @xmath226 does not satisfy any momentum balance , while the net kick velocity was evaluated from the momentum conservation law ( [ eq18 ] ) .",

    "our analysis is based on the bondi - sachs momentum conservation laws which give a clear picture of the processes that generate kicks in the binary merged system .",
    "the impulse imparted to the merged system by the net momentum fluxes carried out by gravitational waves are evaluated as a function of time , for a large domain of the initial data parameters . by numerically integrating the non - axisymmetric rt equation ( via a numerical code based on the galerkin spectral method )",
    "we evaluate the total net impulse at the final time @xmath90 , when the gravitational wave emission ceases .",
    "typically the total net impulse is negative what , in terms of the bondi - sachs momentum conservation law , corresponds to a dominant deceleration regime of the system due to the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "however , for relatively small values of the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath83 an initial positive impulse in the @xmath82 direction may be present , which will be responsible for an initial inspiral branch in the motion of the center - of - mass of the system .",
    "a novel feature of non - head - on collisions ( @xmath272 ) is the nonzero net gravitational wave fluxes for equal - mass colliding black holes , contrary to the cases of head - on collisions and black hole inspiral binaries .",
    "based on the total net impulse we evaluated the net kick velocity@xcite imparted to the system by the gravitational waves emitted .",

    "@xcite which treated the case of gravitational wave recoil in the merger of black hole binary inspirals .",
    "the larger values of the kick velocities obtained in these references is possibly due to the fact that we have restricted our numerical integration to a fixed initial data parameter @xmath42 ( or an initial infalling velocity @xmath2 ) .",

    "a complete and detailed analysis of the kick velocity distribution for a large domain of the initial data parameter space , with special focus on its dependence on the incidence angle @xmath83 , is currently under investigation . .",

    "the center - of - mass velocity ( i ) is proportional to the gravitational wave impulse vector @xmath130 ( or the integrated momentum flux vector @xmath279 ) ; and ( ii ) approaches the net kick velocity as @xmath266 .",
    "this inertial frame is actually the rest frame of the center - of - mass of the merged system at @xmath20 and the trajectory of the center - of - mass is an integral curve of the velocity field @xmath280 .",
    "this integral curve exhibits an initial inspiral branch in the positive @xmath82 semi - plane whenever an initial phase with @xmath114 is present .",
    "we must do a final comment on the connection between the simulations of the present paper ( post - common - horizon , head - on and non - head - on collisions in rt dynamics ) and generic black hole merger kicks .",
    "rt evolutions do not in general model the same physical situation as numerical relativity ( nr ) evolutions of merging binary inspirals , and do not in general cover the same computational domain . in fact , although the physical process that generates recoils in rt evolutions is the same as the one that generates recoils in nr evolutions , namely , the balance between the variation of the momentum of the system and the momentum flux of the gravitational wave emitted , the generation of the momentum flux of the wave may be completely distinct in each case , depending on the specification of the required initial data for the dynamics .",
    "however the generated recoils in both approaches , specifically head - on collision of two black holes ( rt ) and merging binary inspirals ( nr ) , have impressive similar features .",
    "this suggests that  once a common horizon is formed  the generation of the momentum flux of the wave ( which would determine the pattern of the recoils ) might present in this domain a generic behavior and that the characteristic approach can give complementary and reliable results on the momentum extraction of the system .",
    "also , as discussed in the present paper , characteristic initial data for non - head - on collisions@xcite satisfies a slightly modified fitchett @xmath1-scaling law ( [ eq24 ] ) , the modification being necessary to account for the nonzero net momentum flux for equal - mass initial colliding black holes ; the distribution approaches the original fitchett law as the incidence angle of collision approaches zero ( the case of a head - on collision ) . recently the resulting recoil velocity associated with a family of parametrized initial data ( corresponding to a combination of the head - on collision characteristic initial data ) was examined@xcite and was shown not to satisfy fitchett s @xmath1-scaling law , although leading to a zero final recoil for equal - mass black holes .",
