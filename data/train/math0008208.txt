    "physical systems are often described by ordinary differential equations ( odes ) of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the state of the system , @xmath7 a parameter , and @xmath8 denotes time .",
    "the model may however be too crude , since it neglects all kinds of perturbations acting on the system .",
    "we are interested here in the combined effect of two perturbations : a slow drift of the parameter , and an additive noise",
    ".    a slowly drifting parameter @xmath9 , ( with @xmath10 ) , may model the deterministic change in time of some exterior influence , such as the climate acting on an ecosystem or a magnetic field acting on a ferromagnet .",
    "obviously , nontrivial dynamics can only be expected when @xmath7 is allowed to vary by an amount of order @xmath11 , and thus the system has to be considered on the time scale @xmath12 .",
    "this is usually done by introducing the _ slow time _",
    "@xmath13 , which transforms into the singularly perturbed equation @xmath14 it is known that solutions of this system tend to stay close to stable equilibrium branches of @xmath15 @xcite , see a. new , and sometimes surprising phenomena occur when such an equilibrium branch undergoes a bifurcation .",
    "these phenomena are usually called @xcite . in the case of the hopf bifurcation , when the equilibrium gets unstable while expelling a stable periodic orbit , the bifurcation is substantially delayed : solutions of track the unstable equilibrium ( for a _ non - vanishing _ time interval in the limit @xmath16 ) before jumping to the limit cycle @xcite . a similar phenomenon exists for the dynamic pitchfork bifurcation of an equilibrium without drift , the simplest example being @xmath17 ( b ) .",
    "the delay has been observed experimentally , for instance , in lasers @xcite and in a damped rotating pendulum @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have the advantage of providing a genuinely dynamic point of view for the concept of a bifurcation .",
    "although one often says that a bifurcation diagram ( representing the asymptotic states of the system as a function of the parameter ) is obtained by varying the control parameter @xmath7 , the impatient experimentalist taking this literally may have the surprise to discover unstable stationary states of the system ( s)he investigates .",
    "the asymptotic state of the system with slowly varying parameter @xmath18 may depend not only on the initial condition @xmath19 , but also on the history of variation of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the perturbation of by an additive noise can be modeled by a stochastic differential equation ( sde ) of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the standard wiener process , and @xmath1 measures the noise intensity .",
    "a widespread approach is to analyse the probability density of @xmath23 , which satisfies the fokker ",
    "planck equation .",
    "in particular , if @xmath24 can be written as the gradient of a @xmath25 , then there is a unique stationary density @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the normalization .",
    "this formula shows that for small noise intensity , the stationary density is sharply peaked around stable equilibria of @xmath15 .",
    "that method has , however , two major limitations .",
    "the first one is that the fokker - planck equation is difficult to solve , except in the linear and in the gradient case .",
    "the second limitation is more serious : the density gives no information on correlations in time , and even when the density is strongly localized , individual paths can perform large excursions .",
    "this is why other approaches are important .",
    "a classical one is based on the computation of first exit times from the neighbourhood of stable equilibria @xcite .",
    "the effect of bifurcations has been studied more recently by methods based on the concept of random attractors @xcite . in particular , crauel and",
    "flandoli showed that according to their definition , additive noise destroys a pitchfork bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of random attractors is , however , not straightforward , and alternative characterizations of stochastic bifurcations are desirable . in the same way",
    "a slowly varying parameter helps our understanding of bifurcations in the deterministic case , it can provide a new point of view in the case of random dynamical systems .",
    "let us consider the combined effect of a slowly drifting parameter and an additive noise on the ode .",
    "we will focus on the case of a pitchfork bifurcation , where the questions _ how does the additive noise affect the bifurcation delay ? _ and _ where does the path go after crossing the bifurcation point ? _ are of major physical interest .",
    "the situation of the drift term @xmath15 in depending explicitly on time is considerably more difficult to solve than the autonomous case , and thus much less understood .",
    "one can expect , however , that a slow time dependence makes the problem accessible to perturbation theory , and that one may take advantage of techniques developed to study singularly perturbed equations such as . with @xmath9 , equation becomes @xmath28 if we introduce again the slow time @xmath13 , the brownian motion is rescaled , resulting in the sde @xmath29 our analysis of   is restricted to one - dimensional @xmath6 .",
    "the noise intensity @xmath1 should be considered as a function of @xmath0 . indeed ,",
    "since we now consider the equation on the time scale @xmath12 , a constant noise intensity would lead to an infinite spreading of trajectories as @xmath16 . in the case of the pitchfork bifurcation",
    ", we will need to assume that @xmath30 .",
    "various particular cases of equation have been studied before , from a non - rigorous point of view . in the linear case @xmath31 ,",
    "the distribution of first exit times was investigated and compared with experiments in @xcite , while @xcite derived a formula for the last crossing of zero . in the case",
    "@xmath32 , @xcite studied the dependence of the delay on @xmath0 and @xmath1 numerically , while @xcite considered the associated fokker - planck equation , the solution of which she approximated by a gaussian ansatz .    in the present work ,",
    "we analyse for a general class of odd functions @xmath33 undergoing a pitchfork bifurcation .",
    "we use a different approach , based on a precise control of the _ whole paths _",
    "@xmath34 of the process .",
    "the results thus contain much more information than the probability density .",
    "it also turns out that the technique we use allows to deal with nonlinearities in quite a natural way .",
    "our results can be summarized in the following way ( see ):    solutions of the deterministic equation starting near a stable equilibrium branch of @xmath15 are known to reach a neighbourhood of order @xmath0 of that branch in a time of order @xmath35 .",
    "we show that the paths of the sde with the same initial condition are typically concentrated in a neighbourhood of order @xmath1 of the deterministic solution ( theorem  [ t_stable ] ) .",
    "a particular solution of the deterministic equation is known to exist in a neighbourhood of order @xmath0 of each unstable equilibrium branch of @xmath15 .",
    "paths that start in a neighbourhood of order @xmath1 of this solution are likely to leave that neighbourhood in a time of order @xmath35 ( theorem  [ t_unstable ] ) .",
    "when a pitchfork bifurcation occurs at @xmath36 , @xmath37 , the typical paths are concentrated in a neighbourhood of order @xmath3 of the deterministic solution with the same initial condition up to time @xmath2 ( theorem  [ t_before ] ) .",
    "after the bifurcation point , the paths are likely to leave a neighbourhood of order @xmath38 of the unstable equilibrium before a time @xmath39 ( theorem  [ t_escape ] ) .",
    "once they have left this neighbourhood , the paths remain with high probability in a region of size @xmath40 around the corresponding deterministic solution , which approaches a stable equilibrium branch of @xmath15 like @xmath41 ( theorem  [ t_approach ] ) .",
    "these results show that the bifurcation delay , which is observed in the dynamical system  , is destroyed by additive noise as soon as the noise is not exponentially small .",
    "do they mean that the dynamic bifurcation itself is destroyed by additive noise ?",
    "this is mainly a matter of definition . on one hand",
    ", we will see that independently of the initial condition , the probability of reaching the upper , rather than the lower branch emerging from the bifurcation point , is close to @xmath42 . the asymptotic state is thus selected by the noise , and not by the initial condition .",
    "hence , the bifurcation is destroyed in the sense of @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , individual paths are concentrated near the stable equilibrium branches of @xmath15 , which means that the bifurcation diagram will be made visible by the noise , much more so than in the deterministic case .",
    "so we do observe a qualitative change in behaviour when @xmath7 changes its sign , which can be considered as a bifurcation .",
    "the precise statements and a discussion of their consequences are given in section [ sec_results ] . in section  [ ssec_rn ] ,",
    "we analyse the motion near equilibrium branches away from bifurcation points .",
    "the actual pitchfork bifurcation is discussed in section  [ ssec_rb ] .",
    "a few consequences are derived in section  [ ssec_rd ] .",
    "section  [ sec_nobif ] contains the proofs of the first two theorems on the motion near nonbifurcating equilibria , while the proofs of the last three theorems on the pitchfork bifurcation are given in section  [ sec_pitchfork ] .",

    "let us now examine some of the consequences of these results .",
    "first of all , they allow to characterize the influence of additive noise on the bifurcation delay . in the deterministic case ,",
    "this delay is defined as the first exit time from a strip of width @xmath0 around @xmath36 , see theorem [ t_bifdelay ] .",
    "a possible definition of the delay in the stochastic case is thus the first exit time @xmath313 from a similar strip .",
    "an appropriate choice for the width of the strip is @xmath314 , since such a strip will contain @xmath258 for every admissible @xmath194 , and the part of the strip with @xmath270 will be contained in @xmath271 .",
    "theorems [ t_before ] and [ t_escape ] then imply that if @xmath270 , @xmath315 if we choose @xmath91 in such a way that @xmath316 for some @xmath317 , the last expression reduces to @xmath318 which becomes small as soon as @xmath319 .",
    "the bifurcation delay will thus lie with overwhelming probability in the interval @xmath320 theorem [ t_approach ] implies that for times larger than @xmath321 , the paths are unlikely to return to zero in a time of order  @xmath11 .",
    "the wildest behaviour of the paths is to be expected in the interval  , because a region of instability is crossed , where @xmath322 .",
    "our results on the pitchfork bifurcation require @xmath30 , while the estimate is useful as long as @xmath1 is not exponentially small .",
    "we can thus distinguish three regimes , depending on the noise intensity :    @xmath323 : a modification of theorem  [ t_before ] shows that for @xmath324 , the typical spreading of paths is of order @xmath325 .",
    "near the bifurcation point , the process is dominated by noise , because the drift term @xmath326 is too weak to counteract the diffusion .",
    "depending on the global structure of @xmath15 , an appreciable fraction of the paths might escape quite early from a neighbourhood of the bifurcation point .",
    "in that situation , the notion of bifurcation delay becomes meaningless .",
    "@xmath327 for some @xmath328 : the bifurcation delay lies in the interval with high probability , where @xmath329 is still microscopic .",
    "@xmath330 for some @xmath77 : the noise is so small that the paths remain concentrated around the deterministic solution for a time interval of order @xmath11 .",
    "the typical spreading is of order @xmath331 , which behaves like @xmath332 for @xmath270 , see lemma  [ l_ps1 ] .",

    "if @xmath334 , they follow the deterministic solution which makes a quick transition to @xmath93 at @xmath335 .    the expression characterizing the delay is in accordance with experimental results @xcite , and with the approximate calculation of the last crossing of zero @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in @xcite , which are fitted , at @xmath336 , to @xmath337 for weak noise and @xmath338 for strong noise , seem rather mysterious .",
    "finally , the results in  @xcite , who approximates the probability density by a gaussian centered at the deterministic solution , can obviously only apply to the regime of exponentially small noise .",
