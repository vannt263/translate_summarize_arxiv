    "none of these scenarios alone is able to reproduce the observed properties of all the bulges along the hubble sequence since bulges are a class of diverse and heterogeneous objects .",
    "the large bulges of lenticulars and early - type spirals are similar to low - luminosity elliptical galaxies , whereas the small bulges of late - type spirals are reminiscent of disc components ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "we get a more reliable estimate of the galaxy s structural parameters with respect to @xcite since they folded the eastern side of their optical image around the galaxy major axis to deal with the strongest dust lanes of the main disc .",

    "a @xmath3band image of ngc  4698 is available in the first data release of the large area survey of ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss , @xcite ) .",
    "it was obtained on 23 january 2007 with a total exposure time of 40 s. the 3.8-m ukirt telescope is operated in mauna kea observatory ( hawaii , usa ) .",
    "it mounted the wide field camera ( wfcam ) with four rockwell hawaii - ii devices .",
    "each of them consists of @xmath4 hgcdte detectors of @xmath5 @xmath6m@xmath7 and covers a field of view of @xmath8 arcmin@xmath7 with an image scale of @xmath9 arcsec pixel@xmath10 .",
    "the gain and read - out noise were 4.5 @xmath11 count@xmath10 and 25 @xmath11 rms , respectively .",
    "the image was reduced , cleaned for cosmic rays , sky subtracted , and flux calibrated with the wfcam pipeline @xcite . a two - dimensional fit with a circular gaussian to the field stars in the resulting image yielded a @xmath12 arcsec .",
    "the photometric decomposition of the wfcam image of ngc  4698 was performed using the galaxy surface photometry two - dimensional decomposition ( gasp2d ) algorithm by ma+08 , which yields the structural parameters for a srsic bulge and an exponential main disc .",
    "the fitting algorithm relies on a @xmath13 minimisation of the intensities in counts , for which we must adopt initial trial parameters that are as close as possible to their final values .",
    "the trial values of the effective surface brightness , effective radius , shape parameter , position angle , and axial ratio of the bulge ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , pa@xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) and of the central surface brightness , scalelength , position angle , and axial ratio of the main disc ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , pa@xmath21 , and @xmath22 ) were estimated from the analysis of the ellipse - averaged radial profiles of surface brightness @xmath23 , ellipticity @xmath24 , and position angle pa .",
    "the latter were measured using the iraf task ellipse and analysed by following the prescriptions of ma+08 .",
    "starting from these initial trial parameters the different photometric models of the surface brightness were fitted iteratively to the galaxy image .",
    "each image pixel was weighted according to the variance of its total observed photon counts due to the contribution of both galaxy and sky , and determined assuming photon noise limitation and taking the detector read - out noise into account .",
    "seeing effects were also taken into account by convolving the model image with a circular gaussian point spread function ( psf ) with a fwhm matching the observed one .",
    "the convolution was performed as a product in fourier domain before the least - squares minimisation .",
    "only the image pixels with an intensity larger than 0.5 times the sky standard deviation were included in the fit .",
    "foreground stars were masked and excluded from the fit .",
    "the result of the photometric decomposition is shown in fig .",

    "the model surface brightness is consistent with the data within the error bars .",
    "the differences of ellipticity and position angle between the observed and model isophotes are smaller than 0.1 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the pa is scattered in the radial range between about 5 and 20 arcsec where the isophotes are nearly round .",
    "the errors on the fitted parameters were estimated through monte carlo simulations on images of artificial galaxies .",
    "a set of disc galaxies with a srsic bulge and an exponential main disc with @xmath26 mag to bracket the magnitude of ngc  4698 ( @xmath27 mag , @xcite ) was generated .",
    "the artificial galaxies were assumed to be observed at the distance of the virgo cluster taking into account resolution effects .",
    "the parameters of the artificial galaxies were randomly chosen in the ranges observed for nearby s0/a - sb galaxies by @xcite .",
    "finally , a background level and photon noise were added to the simulated images in order to mimic the instrumental setup and signal - to - noise of the wfcam image .",
    "the relative errors in the fitted parameters of the artificial galaxies were estimated by comparing the input and output values and were assumed to be normally distributed .",
    "the standard deviation was adopted as the @xmath28 error in the relevant parameter for the bulge - disc decomposition . the best - fitting values and",

    "systematic errors given by a wrong estimation of the psf fwhm and sky level are the most significant contributors to the error budget , since the spiral arms do not affect the result and no further component is observed .",
    "we estimated a @xmath29 error of 2 and 1 per cent for the sky level and psf fwhm , respectively .",
    "we analysed the artificial galaxies by adopting the correct sky level and a psf fwhm that was 2 per cent larger ( or smaller ) than the actual one or the correct psf fwhm and a sky level that was 1 per cent larger ( or smaller ) than the actual one .",

    "their @xmath29 errors including systematics are smaller than 15 per cent .",
    "the method developed by ma+10 was applied to derive the intrinsic shape of the bulge of ngc  4698 .",

    "the bulge shares the same centre and polar axis as its main disc , which is circular and lies on the equatorial plane of the bulge .",
    "the intrinsic shape of the bulge is recovered from the bulge ellipticity parameter @xmath43 , the twist angle @xmath44 between the major axes of the bulge and main disc ( i.e. , the line of nodes ) , and the main disc inclination @xmath45 .",
    "the relation between the intrinsic and projected parameters depends only on the spatial position of the bulge , i.e. , on the angle @xmath46 measured on the bulge equatorial plane between the principal axis corresponding to @xmath41 and the line of nodes .",

[ eqn : vartie ] has a probability @xmath55 .",
    "this allows to obtain the range of possible values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 for the bulge of ngc  4698 and to constrain its most probable intrinsic shape by adopting the probabilities @xmath56 and @xmath57 derived by following ma+10 .",

    "the galaxy nucleus clearly reveals the presence of a highly elongated structure in all the images .",
    "this is the nsd and its location , orientation , and size are the same in all the observed passbands .",
    "this nuclear structure is associated with a central increase in ellipticity , @xmath24 , and fourth cosine fourier coefficient , @xmath69 , as measured by performing an isophotal analysis using ellipse and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] .",

    "the photometric decomposition was performed independently for each band - pass .",
    "the sb95 method is based on the assumption that the isophotal disciness is the result of the superimposition of a host spheroidal component and an inclined exponential disc .",
    "both the components are assumed to have perfectly elliptical isophotes with constant but different ellipticity .",
    "the method consists of the iterative subtraction of an infinitesimally thin disc model characterised by an exponential surface - brightness profile with central surface brightness @xmath70 , scalelength @xmath71 , axial ratio @xmath72 , and position angle pa@xmath73 .",
    "the nsd parameters are adjusted until the departures from perfect ellipses are minimised ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) . to properly derive the photometric parameters of the nsd , it is important to account for the _ hst _ psf .",
    "for each nuclear disc model , the disc - free image of the galaxy was obtained from the galaxy image by subtracting the nuclear disc model after convolving with the _ hst _ psf .",
    "the adopted psf model was calculated with the tinytim package taking into account the instrumental setup and position of the nsd on the given image @xcite .",

    "f606w _ image with the sb95 method .",
    "they deconvolved the galaxy image from the effects of the psf using the richardson - lucy method .",
    "we decided to repeat the photometric decomposition since both an homogeneous photometric decomposition and an estimate of the errors on the fitted parameters are required to properly compare the structural parameters of the nsd in the different passbands .",
    "moreover , this allowed us to verify that the nsd parameters obtained by subtracting the psf - convolved disc model from the galaxy image are in agreement within the errors with those obtained by subtracting the unconvolved disc model from a deconvolved galaxy image .",
    "to this aim the conversion to johnson @xmath76 band has to be taken into account for a proper comparison of @xmath77 and was calculated with iraf task synphot ( @xmath78 for a spiral galaxy ) .",

    "was best fitted by a very old stellar population ( 10 gyr ) with no evidence for stars younger than 5 gyr in the galaxy nucleus , where the nsd light contamination is large ( @xmath82 per cent , fig .",
    "[ fig : hst ] ) . the light fraction from stars younger than 1 gyr rises to 2 per cent if supersolar - metallicity models are considered .",
    "this implies that the centre of the nsd is made mostly of old stars .",
    "models for chemical and spectro - photometric evolution of galaxy discs predict a strong evolution with age of their colour profiles as direct consequence of an inside - out formation @xcite . in this",
    "scenario colour gradients are produced early on in the disc centre and propagate outwards .",
    "the maximum colour gradient measured for the nsd ( @xmath83 mag kpc@xmath10 ) falls short of the model predictions and it is not consistent with a picture wherein the nuclear disc assembled inside out in the last 5 - 10 gyr .",
    "the structure of the nucleus and bulge of the virgo spiral galaxy ngc  4698 was investigated through a detailed analysis of _ hst _ optical and ukirt near - infrared images , respectively .",
    "the galaxy is known to host a nuclear disc of gas and stars which is rotating perpendicularly with respect to the galaxy main disc . moreover , the bulge and main disc appear on the sky elongated perpendicular to each other @xcite .",
    "the equatorial ellipticity and intrinsic flattening of the polar bulge were obtained following ma+10 from the apparent ellipticity of the bulge , twist angle between the bulge and main disc , and main disc inclination measured in the ukidss near - infrared image by adopting the photometric decomposition method by ma+08 .",
    "the bulge of ngc  4698 is remarkably elongated in a perpendicular direction with respect to the disc plane ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "although the consistency with axisymmetry was recognised ( @xmath59 ) , still the probability that it is significantly triaxial ( i.e. , with an equatorial elliptical section with @xmath61 ) is 50 per cent . the central surface brightness , scalelength , inclination , and position angle of the polar nsd in all the available _ hst _ images were measured by assuming it is an infinitesimally thin exponential disc and applying the photometric decomposition method of sb95 as implemented by @xcite .",
    "the size , orientation , and location of the polar nsd do not depend on the observed passband , as already observed for the few other nsds for which a detailed multi - band photometric analysis was performed ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of these new results about the complex structure of ngc  4698 gives us the opportunity to gain further insight on the formation of nsds with the goal of motivating numerical modelling to test and refine this scenario .",
    "the kinematical decoupling between two components of a galaxy suggests the occurrence of an accretion event or merging @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to explain the existence of the orthogonally - rotating dynamically - cold nuclear disc in ngc  4698 as the end result of the acquisition of external gas by the pre - existing galaxy .",
    "gas dissipation is indeed a necessary ingredient since purely stellar dynamical mergers can not form a nuclear disc @xcite . in ngc  4698 the accreted gas settled on the principal plane perpendicular to the shortest axis of the triaxial bulge ( i.e. , perpendicular to the galaxy main disc ) and formed stars .",
    "the major axis of the nsd is elongated in the same direction as the bulge .",
    "the link between the angular momentum transport from galactic to nuclear scales and formation of nsds has been recently investigated by @xcite .",
    "the stellar population in the centre of ngc  4698 is very old @xcite .",
    "the absence of colour gradients in the nsd is explained if either the star formation homogeneously occurred all over the extension of the disc or the nsd assembled through an inside - out process that ended more than 5 gyr ago .",
