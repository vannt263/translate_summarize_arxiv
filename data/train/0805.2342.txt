    "one of the most productive and perspective ideas in nuclear many - body theory is the concept of independent single - particle motion in the mutually generated mean field .",
    "it explains many nuclear observables qualitatively and provides a basis for quantative descriptions of nuclei within various versions of the shell model . over the last decade",
    ", the experimental study of single - particle motion has shifted towards nuclei near the edge of stability with the emphasis on the occupation probabilities of single - particle orbits as indicators of the evolution of nuclear shell structure near the drip line .",
    "these occupancies are usually determined by comparing the measured cross sections of one - nucleon transfer , breakup , knockout and coulomb dissociation reactions , to those predicted theoretically . in these calculations ,",
    "the single particle motion is represented by the overlap integral between the many - body wave functions of neighbouring mass @xmath3 and @xmath4 nuclei .",
    "most theoretical analyses assume these overlaps can be calculated using potential models that employ standard woods - saxon potentials . with these potentials , at radii outside the binding interaction ,",
    "the overlap integrals achieve their asymptotic form given by an exponential decrease with a decay constant @xmath5 determined by the nucleon separation energy @xmath6 , with @xmath7 is the @xmath8+@xmath9 reduced mass .",
    "this region gives important contribution to the amplitudes of one - nucleon removal reactions and is crucial to predict direct nucleon capture reactions relevant to nuclear astrophysics .",
    "it has been shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that there exist a class of nuclei for which one - nucleon overlaps can reach their asymptotics much later than usual .",
    "this class includes the nuclei at the limits of nuclear stability with very similar one- and two - nucleon separation energies , @xmath6 and @xmath10 , both of which are significantly smaller than for stable nuclei .",
    "such nuclei , for example @xmath0be , @xmath1c , @xmath2ne , can be considered as cluster systems of a core and two valence nucleons .",
    "the correlations of the two nucleons outside of the nuclear core can lead to non - standard behaviour of the overlap because even when one nucleon is removed far from the center - of - mass of the residual mass @xmath4 nucleus , it will still be affected by its interaction with the remaining loosely - bound nucleon in @xmath4 .",
    "the possibility for such an effect follows from the feynman diagram approach in which the asymptotics of the overlap integrals for many - body systems are represented by a sum of different feynman diagrams .",
    "it has been noticed by blokhintsev @xcite that , although in most cases the standard point diagram gives the exponential decrease with the smallest decay constant @xmath11 , sometimes other diagrams can give a much slower decrease than that governed by the differences in initial and final binding energies .",
    "the feynman diagram technique , applied in @xcite to one - neutron overlaps for core+2n cluster systems , suggests that although the standard term , @xmath12 , dominates at very large @xmath13 , the contribution @xmath14 from the generalised triangle diagram , corresponding to the @xmath15 virtual process , is determined by the decay constant @xmath16 that can be larger than @xmath11 by only 40@xmath17 .",
    "it means that if the strength of the generalised triangle diagram is large then its contribution can be noticeable for range of @xmath13 where the standard behaviour @xmath12 is traditionally assumed to be achieved .",
    "the abnormal asymptotic behaviour was modelled in @xcite for the @xmath18be@xmath19be@xmath20 overlap by adding a long - range potential to a local potential model .",
    "the resulting overlap was then used to predict longitudinal momentum distributions for one - neutron knockout from @xmath0be .",
    "comparison of the latter to available experimental data suggests such abnormalities would take place for @xmath21be distances between 5 and 10 fm .",
    "however , the contribution from the generalised triangle diagram can be calculated reliably only for @xmath22 , which for @xmath0be is @xmath23 fm , therefore , to understand the overlap behaviour at @xmath24 fm exact dynamical three - body calculations should be carried out .    here",
    ", we calculate one - nucleon overlaps using a three - body core+2n model and compare them to the predictions of the standard potential model ( sec .",
