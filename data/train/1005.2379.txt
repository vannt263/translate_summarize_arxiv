    "blazars , a class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) comprised of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl  lac objects , exhibit some of the most violent high - energy phenomena observed in agns to date .",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by non - thermal continuum spectra with a broad low - frequency component in the radio  uv or x - ray frequency range and a high - frequency component from x - rays to @xmath1-rays .",
    "they show rapid variability across the electromagnetic spectrum . in extreme cases ,",
    "the very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath1-ray emission of blazars has been observed to vary on time scales of just a few minutes @xcite .",
    "leptonic and hadronic models ( for a recent review see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can generally successfully account for the overall seds observed from the known vhe @xmath1-ray blazars , which are almost all bl lac objects .",
    "bl lac objects span a wide range of synchrotron peak frequencies , from ir to x - rays . according to the location of the synchrotron peak , they are classified as low frequency peaked bl lacs ( lbls : synchrotron peak in the ir ) , intermediate bl lac objects ( ibls : synchrotron peak in the optical / uv ) or high frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls : synchrotron peak in the x - rays ) . until very recently , all known vhe @xmath1-ray blazars were hbls .",
    "however , the recent detections of the ibls w  comae , 3c  66a , and pks  1424 + 240 by veritas @xcite , the lbls bl  lacertae and s5  0716 + 714 by magic @xcite , and even the flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) 3c  279 by magic @xcite and pks  1510 - 089 by hess @xcite suggest that most blazars are intrinsically emitters of vhe @xmath1-rays .",
    "the fact that most lbls and fsrqs have not been detected as vhe @xmath1-ray sources might be primarily a result of the absorption of vhe @xmath1-rays by lower - frequency ( ir  optical  uv ) radiation .",
    "as those objects tend to be located at greater cosmological distances ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath2 absorption on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) becomes substantial , suppressing any intrinsically produced @xmath4  gev emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", it seems plausible that most lbls and fsrqs and their misaligned parent population , radio galaxies , are producing vhe @xmath1-ray emission within their blazar zone .",
    "this view is also supported by the detection of vhe @xmath1-ray emission from two non - blazar agns , namely the radio galaxies m87 @xcite and cen  a @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of vhe @xmath1-rays from most lbls and fsrqs might then be due to the combined effects of local and intergalactic @xmath2 absorption . as a consequence of @xmath2 absorption in the local radiation field of the agn , gev  tev electron - positron pairs",
    "are injected into the agn environment , which , in the dense radiation field within the blr and the dust torus of quasars , may initiate inverse - compton supported pair cascades .",
    "the development of pair cascades induced by vhe @xmath1-ray emission from blazars has so far concentrated on the development of mpc - scale pair halos resulting from the interaction of ( @xmath6  tev ) @xmath1-rays with the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or of vhe ( @xmath6  gev ) @xmath1-rays by the ebl @xcite . due to the long compton cooling timescale of pairs on the cmb or the ebl",
    ", those authors could reasonably consider the produced cascades isotropic , leading to an extended pair halo around the agn .",
    "small - angle deflection of secondaries in weak intergalactic magnetic fields has been included in those considerations by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the development of pair cascades within the agn has been discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "depending on the magnetic field strength and orientation in the extended nuclear region , cascades developing within the high - radiation - energy - density environment within the blr of a quasar may be efficiently isotropized in the immediate vicinity of the agn .",
    "this will lead to distinct spectral features , which we will consider in this paper . in section",
    "[ estimates ] we present some general considerations and analytic estimates of the expected results , including an estimate of the required magnetic field strengths within @xmath7  a few pc from the central engine of a blazar ( or radio galaxy ) , for which secondary electrons and positrons in pair cascades initiated by primary vhe @xmath1-rays may be efficiently isotropized within the central region .",
    "the consequence would be quasi - isotropic radiation signatures from compton - supported pair cascades , potentially observable in the _ fermi _ energy range . in section [ setup ] we will describe a numerical code that treats the full three - dimensional development of these cascades , together with the general model setup and simplifying assumptions .",
    "numerical results for generic parameters will be presented in section [ parameterstudy ] . in section [ ngc ]",
    ", we will demonstrate that the recent _ fermi _ detection of the radio galaxy ngc  1275 @xcite can be plausibly explained by the cascade emission from a misaligned vhe @xmath1-ray emitting blazar .",
    "we summarize and present an outlook towards future work in section [ summary ] .",
    "in the limit of a vhe @xmath1-ray photon with energy @xmath8 interacting with an ir / optical / uv photon from the dust torus or the blr with energy @xmath9 , an electron - positron pair with particle energy @xmath10  tev will be produced , moving along the direction of the primary @xmath1-ray photon to within an accuracy of @xmath11 .",
    "depending on the strength of the magnetic field near the point of pair production , @xmath12 g , they will be deflected on a length scale of the order of the larmor radius , @xmath13 to investigate whether particles are efficiently isotropized before producing secondary synchrotron and/or inverse - compton ( ic ) emission , the isotropization length has to be compared with the radiative cooling length , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the synchrotron cooling length can be estimated to @xmath16 to estimate the ic cooling length on an external radiation field from the blr we calculate its energy density as @xmath17 , which we parameterize through the accretion disk luminosity @xmath18 erg  s@xmath19 and a blr with a reprocessing optical depth of @xmath20 at an average distance of @xmath21  pc from the central engine .",
    "hence , the total luminosity of the blr will be @xmath22 .",
    "if compton scattering occurs in the thomson regime , we find @xmath23 this illustrates that one may expect particles at energies substantially below 1  tev to be fully isotropized , while higher - energy particles might lose a substantial fraction of their energy while still traveling along the primary vhe @xmath1-ray beam .",
    "comparison of the synchrotron and ic cooling lengths suggests that the radiative output from the secondaries will be strongly dominated by ic emission , initiating an ic - supported cascade ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at low frequencies far below the pair production threshold , produced by secondaries which are fully isotropized ( i.e. , @xmath24 )",
    ", the cascade spectrum will obtain a @xmath25 shape .",
    "this is the consequence of the secondaries being injected at high energies and then being subject to compton cooling in the thomson regime , resulting in a @xmath26 pair spectrum .",
    "this low - energy spectral shape ( though not its total flux ) will be independent of the primary gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "two effects will produce a turnover towards higher frequencies .",
    "first , for any given viewing angle @xmath27 with respect to the direction of propagation of the primary @xmath1-ray ( being absorbed in the @xmath2 pair production process ) , we can find a critical electron energy for which the deflection angle over a compton length equals the observing angle , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "higher - energy particles will radiate preferentially at smaller viewing angles , while lower - energy particles can efficiently contribute to the emission at the given angle .",
    "this yields the characteristic electron energy @xmath29 corresponding to a given observing angle @xmath27 :    @xmath30    if these electrons can scatter the soft photon field in the thomson regime , a turnover should occur at photon energies of    @xmath31    we point out that , in this estimate , we assumed that the compton cooling length is a realistic measure of the distance travelled by the electron / positron since its production from annihilation of a primary @xmath1-ray .",
    "this approximation will break down if the particles require multiple compton scatterings to reach the break energy corresponding to eq .",
    "[ icbreak ] .",
    "this is due to both an increasing compton cooling length and a decreasing larmor radius as the electron energy is reduced by previous scatterings .",
