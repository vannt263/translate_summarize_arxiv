    "thus , let us consider a substance , placed into an electric field .",
    "interaction @xmath23 of an edm @xmath24 of a nucleus with an electric field @xmath25 is similar to interaction of magnetic moment of a nucleus with a magnetic field and can be expressed as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the nucleus spin .",
    "if the nucleus environment in the substance does not possess cubic symmetry , then the energy of interaction of nuclear quadrupole moment with a nonuniform electric field field produced nucleus environment should be added to ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "if an external magnetic field also presents , then the energy of interaction of nuclear magnetic moment with this field should be added to ( [ 1 ] ) , too .",
    "but here we will omit these contributions , assuming that there is no an external magnetic field and an elementary cell of the substance is cubic .",
    "the interaction of nucleus with the field @xmath25 ( [ 1 ] ) makes spins of nuclei at low temperature polarized similar to the polarization ( magnetization ) of nuclei by a magnetic field due to the interaction @xmath29 of a nucleus magnetic moment @xmath30 with a magnetic field @xmath31 : @xmath32    spins of nuclei polarized by an electic field induce the magnetic field @xmath33 and change in the magnetic flux @xmath34 at the surface of a flat sheet of material ( fig.1 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the sample area , @xmath37 is the magnetic susceptibility of nuclei subsystem .",
    "= 14.5 cm    for the temperature range above the temperature of nuclear magnetic ordering the susceptibility @xmath38 is described by langevin s formula as follows : @xmath39 @xmath40 is the number of nuclear spins in @xmath41 , @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the nucleus bohr magneton , @xmath44 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath45 is the effective electric field at the location of the nuclear spin .",
    "reasons providing interaction of an electric dipole moment with an electric field in spite of electrostatic shielding are specified in @xcite .",
    "let us compare ( [ 3 ] ) for @xmath46 with the similar expression in @xcite for the magnetic flux @xmath47 produced by electrons of atoms : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the magnetic susceptibility of a material caused by paramagnetic atoms , @xmath50 is the magnetic moment of the electron shell of the atom .",
    "as it has been already mentioned , the magnitude of the susceptibility @xmath11 grows with temperature @xmath51 tending to the temperature of magnetic ordering and appears equal to 1 at some temperature value @xmath52 .",
    "at this temperature ( note that for nuclei @xmath53 k , while for atom spins @xmath54 k ) the magnetic flux produced by nuclei is @xmath55 the magnetic flux produced by atoms @xmath56    let us consider temperature range close to the temperature of nuclear magnetic ordering .",
    "suppose nuclear edm is of the same order as edm of an electron ( atom ) @xmath57 .",
    "then , from ( [ 8],[9 ] ) we obtain the magnetic flux @xmath58 i.e. the magnetic flux produced by nuclei is @xmath59 times greater than the magnetic flux produced by atom spins !    according to estimations @xcite the sensitivity for atom edm measurement @xmath60 in 10 days of averaging ( and even @xmath61 ) can be obtained for the material temperature @xmath62 k.    cooling of nuclear system to the temperature @xmath63 k provides the magnetic flux @xmath64 .",
    "due to @xmath65 the sensitivity for measurement of nuclear edm appears the same as for electron ( atom ) edm i.e. @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the method for measurement of nuclear edm by means of measurement of the induced magnetic field gives hope to obtain considerably substantial limit for the nuclear edm .",
    "let us note that in ferroelectric materials there are very intense internal electric fields @xmath67 that are considerably more intense than external fields .",
    "this provides to advance to @xmath17 values less than @xmath61 .",
    "if an external magnetic field acts on a material , the nuclei spins become polarized due to nucleus magnetization .",
    "therefore , the nucleus electric dipole moments appears polarized , too .",
    "this results in the induction of an electric field @xmath68 ( fig.2 ) ( similar the electron case @xcite ) : @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the degree that the spins of nuclei are polarized in the sample .",
    "there are methods providing @xmath71 for nuclei at low temperatures .",
    "= 14.5 cm    according to the analysis @xcite the technique for electric fields measurement provides a sensitivity @xmath60 in 10 days of operation .",
    "the same sensitivity can be obtained for nuclear edm due to high polarization degree available for nuclear spins at low temperatures",
    ".    an electric field induced by a magnetic field in vacuum can be increased by the use of electrostatic shielding or by selection of target shape ( for example , a target having an edge ) .",
    "this gives hope for further improvement of the possibile limits for the edm measurement ( @xmath72 @xmath1 ) in such experiments .",
    "it is important to pay attention that carrying out the proposed experiment to measure nuclear edm one should consider additional effect of time - reversal violating generation of static magnetic and electric fields caused by the t - odd polarizability of atoms , molecules and other particles @xcite . according to the idea of @xcite ,",
    "an induced magnetic field appears on the particle due to the action of a field @xmath73 under conditions of violation of p- and t - invariance ( and similar , an induced electric field appears on the particle due to the action of a field @xmath74 ) .",
    "this new effect does not depend on temperature .",
    "an effect magnitude is determined by a p - odd t - odd tensor polarisability @xmath75 of a particle ( atom , molecule , nucleus , neutron , electron and so on ) . for an atom ( molecule )",
    ", @xmath75 arises due to p- and t - odd interaction of electrons with a nucleus @xcite .",
    "let us place an atom ( molecule ) into an electric field @xmath76 .",
    "the induced magnetic dipole moment @xmath77 appears in this case @xcite : @xmath78 the tensor @xmath75 ( like any tensor of rank two ) can be expanded into scalar , simmetric and antisimmetric parts .",
    "the antisymmetric part of the tensor @xmath75 is proportional to @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the totally antisymmetric tensor of rank three .",
    "the symmetric part of the tensor @xmath75 is proportional to the tensor of quadrupolarization @xmath81 $ ] . as a result @xmath82 where @xmath83 are the scalar , vector and tensor p- , t - odd polarizabilities of the particle , respectively . for a substance with the nonpolarized spins @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( here @xmath86 is the atom ( molecule ) spin density matrix ) . as a result for such a substance",
    ", @xmath75 appears to be a scalar @xmath87 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 8 ] ) that in a substance placed into electric field the magnetic field is induced @xcite : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the local electric field acting on an atom in the substance .",
    "vice versa , if an atom ( molecule , nucleus ) is placed into a magnetic field , the induced electric dipole moment @xmath90 appears @xcite , @xmath91 where the tensor polarizability @xmath92 is @xmath93 .",
    "the above dipole moment @xmath90 leads to the induction of an electric field in the substance : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the local magnetic field , acting on the considered particle in the substance .    polarized",
    "electron spins give one more contribution to the magnetic field    therefore , the magnetic field @xmath95 , which is going to be measured in the proposed experiment , should be written as : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the magnetic field produced by atom spins .",
    "let us consider now the experiment to detect the electric dipole moment of the nucleus by means of measurement of the electric field ( see ( [ 5 ] ) ) . in this case we also should take into consideration the effect of electric field induction by the magnetic field ( [ d_i ] ) and the electric field @xmath98 produced by polarized edm of atoms .",
    "thus , the electric field measured in the proposed experiment is as follows ( see ( 9),(10 ) ) : @xmath99    so , measurement of @xmath100 and @xmath101 provides knowledge about nuclear edm , electron edm and @xmath102 . to distinguish these contributions one should consider the fact that studying @xmath103 and @xmath104 dependence on temperature allows one to evaluate different contributions from @xcite",
    "it should be emphasized that atom edm does not contribute to the discussed phenomena if the substance is diamagnetic ( atom spin is equal to zero or spin atoms are nonpolarized ) @xcite .",
    "if the substance consists of several types of atoms ( nuclei ) , then their contribution to the induced field is expressed as a sum of contributions from different atoms : @xmath105",
    "analysis of experimental limits obtained for edm of atoms and nuclei was done in @xcite .",
    "the possible values for constants describing t - odd , p - odd interaction were found there on the basis of calculation shiff edm of nuclei @xcite .",
    "the structure of an electric field inside a nucleus was also analysed and it was shown that it leads to an additional contribution to nuclear edm , which was called ldm @xcite .",
    "the mentioned contributions to edm are finally caused by interference of strong , t-,p - odd and electrostatic interactions .",
    "attention should drawn to the fact that there is one more contribution to nuclear edm different from those , considered in @xcite .",
    "this addition is caused by electromagnetic currents @xcite .",
    "according to the above the induced magnetic moment @xmath106 of a particle appears due to action of a field @xmath25 under conditions of violation of p- and t - invarince ( and similar , induced electric dipole moment @xmath107 of a particle appears due to the action of a magnetic field @xmath31 ) : @xmath108 @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the t - odd polarizability tensor of the particle ( atom , nucleus , neutron , electron and so on ) .    as a result ,",
    "the induced electric @xmath111 and magnetic @xmath112 fields appear in space .",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleus ( multipoles of high orders ) interacts with the field @xmath112 .",
    "particularly , interaction of the magnetic moment density @xmath113 of a particle with the field @xmath112 can be expressed as : @xmath114    as the field @xmath112 is proportional to the electric field @xmath25 , then ( [ wind ] ) can be rewritten @xmath115 where constant @xmath116 is the t - odd susceptibility of a nucleus , @xmath117 is the magnetic moment of the nucleus .      as one can see",
    "( [ wind1 ] ) is similar to the interaction of an electric dipole moment @xmath120 with an electric field .",
    "one more contribution to the nuclear edm appears by the following way .",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleus @xmath117 creates the magnetic field @xmath121 inside the nucleus , here @xmath122 is the nucleus density per one nucleon . according to ( [ interaction ] ) this field induces an additional contribution to the edm @xmath123 .",
    "more rigorously the mentioned contributions to the edm can be calculated by including electromagnetic interactions between nucleons in hamiltonian along with strong and weak interactions and by considering of radiation corrections to the energy of interaction of a nucleus with an external field @xcite .    as a result",
    "the total energy of nucleus interaction with an external electric field can be written as follows : @xmath124 where @xmath4 is the contribution to edm considered in @xcite , @xmath125 is the contribution to edm due to magnetic field induced inside the nucleus ( let us call it pseudo - dipole moment @xmath125 ) , @xmath126 is nucleus edm .",
    "interaction of the magnetic moment @xmath128 of a particle with the field @xmath129 can be estimated as @xmath130 .",
    "the induced magnetic moment @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the transition matrix element of the operator of electric dipole moment , @xmath133 is the transition matrix element of the operator of magnetic dipole moment , @xmath134 is the typical distance between levels of opposite parity ( for neutron it is about 1 gev , for nuclei it is about hundreds kev @xmath135 mev ) , @xmath136 is the coefficient of mixing of the opposite parity states by t-,p - odd interaction , @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the matrix element of t-,p - odd interaction between states of opposite parity .        considering a  free  nucleus ( without electron shell )",
    "we can obtain from ( [ 20 ] ) the following estimation for the addition @xmath140 induced by magnetic interactions @xmath141@xmath142 is the nucleus radius , @xmath36 is the number of nucleons in the nucleus , for this estimation it is suposed that @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 is the compton wavelength of the nucleon , @xmath146 .",
    "suppose that typical difference between levels is about several mev we obtain for heavy nuclei @xmath147 this estimation is done in assumption that nucleons are unstructured .",
    "considering also a t - odd polarizability @xmath148 of nucleons we can see that an external electric field induces a nucleon magnetic moment @xmath149 and this magnetic moment creates a magnetic field inside the nucleus @xmath150the interaction of the magnetic moment of the nucleus with this field contributes to nucleus edm as follows : @xmath151where @xmath40 is the density of nucleons in the nucleus , for a nucleon @xmath152 .",
    "suppose that for a nucleon @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 .",
    "the same conclusion can be done from the following reasoning .",
    "the magnetic moment of a nucleus @xmath117 creates inside the nucleus a magnetic field @xmath163 , where @xmath122 is the nucleus density per one nucleon .",
    "the field @xmath164 induces an electric dipole moment of nucleon @xmath165      it should be mentioned that the spin structure of the nuclear interaction between nuclons is similar to the magnetic interaction .",
    "due to this reason the spin of the nucleus acts on the other nucleons by dint of the average nuclear field , depending on the spin orientation ( let us call this field a pseudo - magnetic nuclear field , similar to the field appearing in a polarized nuclear target ) .",
    "the action of this field ( similar to the action of an ordinary magnetic field ) induces the electric dipole moment of nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "this contribution is appreciably ( two orders ) greater than @xmath160 due to big value of the pseudo - magnetic nuclear field , but it is quite difficult to evaluate this contribution .    let us consider deuteron edm .",
    "deuteron edm was calculated in @xcite . according to",
    "@xcite deuteron edm arouses due to mixing of stationary states of a system  neutron+proton  ( interacting one with each other by strong interaction ) by the t - odd , p - odd interactions .       considering only strong interactions we can find a wavefunction of p - state of a system of two nucleons using an approximation of zero radius of nuclear forces , because strong interactions are short - range @xcite .",
    "but electromagnetic interactions makes the interaction between n and p far - ranging .",
    "thus , taking electromagnetic interaction into account we must consider for p - state a correcton to the wavefunction , caused by this interaction .",
    "a matrix element of the transition current for the n - p system can be expressed in conventional form : @xmath167 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term proportional to @xmath168 describes transitions between triplet states , while the term including @xmath169 corresponds to the transitions between triplet and singlet states .",
    "let us place deuteron into an external electric field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the n - p system is expressed as : @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the hamiltonian of the np system considering both the strong and electromagnetic interactions between nucleons , @xmath172 , @xmath173 is the operator of the electric dipole moment of the n - p system . according to @xcite the energy of t - odd interaction @xmath174      considering only strong and weak interactions for",
    "the deuteron edm @xcite one should take into account the first term proportional to @xmath168 .",
    "consideration of electromagnetic interactions leads to the conclusion that the term proportional to @xmath169 also contributes to the deuteron edm .",
    "so , due to electromagnetic interaction the deuteron edm is determined by both the constants @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "considering estimation ( 31 - 33 ) we obtain for deuteron @xmath180 @xmath181e ."
