    "magnetism in rare earth intermetallic compounds is interesting due to the competing interaction between ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) and kondo exchange interaction .",
    "such compounds exhibit various diverse ground states depending on the relative strength of rkky and kondo exchange interaction , for example , ceal@xmath5 , cecu@xmath6  @xcite are heavy - fermion kondo systems without long range magnetic ordering ; ceal@xmath7 , ceb@xmath6  @xcite are kondo lattice compounds with magnetic ordering at low temperature . in cein@xmath5 , pressure induced superconductivity is observed  @xcite . in view of these interesting properties , rare earth intermetallic compounds , especially ce - based compounds , where @xmath8 level lies close to the fermi energy ,",
    "have been studied extensively over last several decades .",
    "we have previously grown the single crystal of cemg@xmath5 , and studied its magnetic properties  @xcite .",
    "it was found that cemg@xmath5 is a heavy fermion kondo lattice compound with a nel temperature of 2.6  k. in continuation to our investigations on binary ce compounds , we report here on the magnetic properties of the equiatomic compound ceal . from the neutron scattering studies on polycrystalline ceal lawrence et al . ,  @xcite have reported that this compound orders antiferromagnetically at 10.2  k , without any suppression of the local moment in the ground state .",
    "they have estimated an ordered moment of 1.72  @xmath9/ce , which is very close to the free ion value of ce@xmath10 ( 2.14  @xmath9/ce ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] which is extracted from ref .",
    "it is obvious from the figure that the phase ceal melts incongruently and hence could not be grown directly from its stoichiometric melt .",
    "hence the single crystals of ceal have been grown from an off - stoichiometric ratio by the high temperature solution growth or the so called flux method .",
    "high purity starting elements of @xmath11 pure - ce and @xmath12",
    "pure - al were taken in the ratio @xmath13 in a high quality recrystallized alumina crucible and sealed inside a quartz ampoule under a vacuum of 10@xmath14  torr .",
    "the ampoule was heated to 1050  @xmath15c in a resistive heating box - type furnace and held at this temperature for 24  hrs for proper homogenization of the melt .",
    "the temperature profile of the crystal growth process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in order to avoid the ceal@xmath7 phase formation , we cooled the melt very rapidly to 850  @xmath15c and then employed a cooling rate of 2",

    "we have adopted similar procedure for the growth of laal single crystals as well .",
    "several needle like crystals were obtained with typical dimensions of length about 1 to 2  mm and 0.5  mm thickness .",
    "ceal single crystals were found to be stable in air while laal samples were found to be oxidizing when exposed in air for an extended period of time .",
    "the phase purity of the sample was determined from the powder x - ray diffraction measurement using panalytical x - ray diffractometer with the monochromatic cu@xmath16 radiation ( = 1.5406  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured down to 1.8  k by four probe method in a home made set - up .",
    "magnetization and magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "heat capacity was measured using a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "since the single crystals of ceal have been grown from an off - stoichiometric starting composition , in order to check the phase purity , we recorded the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern of the powdered single crystal which is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is evident from the xrd pattern that the grown crystals are of single phase and no traces of any flux impurity is observed . to estimate the lattice constant",

    "since the crystals were very tiny we measured the magnetic susceptibility parallel and perpendicular to the length of the crystal . from laue diffraction , we found that the length of the crystal corresponds to [ 001 ] direction . at high temperature",
    "the magnetic susceptibility follows curie - weiss behaviour .",

    "the negative value of @xmath28 is in conformity with the antiferromagnetic nature of magnetic ordering in ceal .",
    "figure  [ fig3](b ) shows the isothermal magnetization measured at 2  k. two metamagnetic transitions are observed due to the spin reorientation caused by the applied magnetic field .",
    "it is evident from the figure that for fields parallel to the length of the crystal , the magnetization is linear and much smaller and attains only a value of 0.34  @xmath9/ce . on the other hand ,",
    "when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the length of the crystal , the magnetization undergoes two spin - flop transitions due to the re - orientation of the spins .",
