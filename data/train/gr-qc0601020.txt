    "being unrelated to the renormalization of the amplitude with pole in @xmath25 , these diagrams should be considered in line with other ones .",

    "the diagram depicted in fig.[f1]c contributes to the classical correction to the minkowski metric @xmath52 however , this correction is actually induced by the tree diagram ( fig.[f2]a ) .",
    "the decomposition on the background field and its fluctuations ( [ e2 ] ) has no sense for such diagrams , because the integration momentum ( flowing through the `` legs with crosses ''  in fig.[f2]a ) is of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that the leading classical correction to the minkowski metric      is of the same order as the field @xmath8 ; consequently , it serves no purpose to distinguish them . since the correction ( [ e23a ] )",
    "is not the leading one , therefore it is possible to turn back to the initial variables ( [ e2 ] ) rather than ( [ e16 ] ) , i.e. @xmath55      it should be repeated once again that the quantum correction ( [ e23 ] ) is the leading one , therefore the trick ( [ e24 ] ) does not permit to turn back to the former variables , i.e , the correction must be invariant by itself .",
    "an important point is that @xmath57-dependent contributions to the potential vanish in the sum of the diagrams fig.[f2]a and fig.[f2]b only , i.e. , even on the level of classical gravity one can not introduce the physically meaningful `` one - particle - irreducible potential ''  ( contrary to the section viii of ref.@xcite ) ."
