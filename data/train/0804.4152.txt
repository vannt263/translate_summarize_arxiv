    "multi - agent systems often involve only simple ingredients and rules , yet can lead to `` complex '' dynamical behavior . in general the agents of such systems",
    "interact locally ( e.g. , only within nearest neighbors on a lattice ) or may interact with all other agents ( corresponding to a mean - field system ) . the network of interactions is then given a priori and is time independent , only the internal states of the agents change with time .",
    "however there are many situations where the network structure will be influenced by the agents actions : agents may move around and redefine their neighborhoods , or they may choose their interactions according to their internal states .",
    "for instance , in transportation networks , population increases will lead to the construction of new links , and inversely the introduction of new connections will affect the dynamics of the populations .",
    "analogous examples abound both in artificial networks ( communication , distribution , etc . ) and in natural networks ( biological , ecological , social , ... ) . having both dynamic agents and dynamic connections",
    "potentially allows for new phenomena , be - it at the level of the agents or at the level of their network of interactions .",
    "networks whose links change with time are often referred to as adaptive networks .",
    "there is a rich literature on such networks , reviewed in particular in refs .",
    "but as noted by these authors , in most such investigations , the dynamics of the network occur on a very different time scale from that of the variables ( or `` fields '' ) affecting these changes . only for consensus - forming networks",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) and variations thereof  @xcite do the links change at a rate comparable to the fields ( agent opinions in this case ) ; but because opinions are discrete or because of the nature of these models , one does not reach a critical state generically . for our work",
    "we seek systems which spontaneously lead to criticality ( without any parameter fine - tuning ) and for which the network and the fields driving the network have comparable time scales .",
    "this challenge is particularly relevant today because the last decade has revealed that many natural and artificial networks have strong topological heterogeneities and are often scale free .",
    "surprisingly , the modeling of such networks is almost always based on growth rules : attachment of a new link is preferentially done to hubs  @xcite , or it depends on fixed hidden variables on the nodes  @xcite .",
    "such frameworks are out of equilibrium and have no steady state ; in addition , they ignore the dynamics of the quantities implicitly associated with the nodes in most real world examples . in the work described here , the internal state of each agent can influence the link dynamics , and at the same time the set of existing links affects the dynamics of the agents .",
    "we present our model in the language of macro - economics where agents have wealth , perform transactions amongst themselves , and can see their wealth increase multiplicatively as in financial holdings .",
    "this choice is motivated by the overwhelming evidence that wealth dynamics in human societies spontaneously evolves to criticality .",
    "in particular , individual wealth follows a `` pareto '' law  @xcite with power law tails for the wealthy ; similar fat tails also arise in corporate wealth , e.g. , in the distribution of sizes of firms  @xcite .",
    "our framework extends a model proposed by bouchaud and mzard  @xcite to the case where the network of interactions is heterogenous and adaptive .",
    "we find that in the absence of regulatory mechanisms , the system naturally goes to a `` collapsed '' phase where the great majority of agents becomes marginalized ( poverty stricken ) and isolated . including a minimum support level to maintain agent connectivity ,",
    "the system is instead generically driven to a self - organised critical steady state ; in this steady state , the distribution of wealth of agents has a fat tail and the adaptive network is scale free .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is defined in sect .",
    "[ sect_model ] ; we also present different observables of interest and sketch our simulational methods . in sect .",
    "[ sect_quenched ] we exhibit the power laws arising in the quenched systems : that of the node degree distribution when the wealth is frozen and that of the wealth distribution when the network links are frozen , considering in particular the effects of network heterogeneity . in sect .",
    "[ sect_implementation ] the settings of the respective time scales for agent vs. network dynamics are presented .",
    "then we examine the full model where the network is adaptive ( the link dynamics is affected by the agents and vice - versa ) in sect .  [ sect_full ] .",
    "we conclude in sect .",
    "[ sect_conclusions ] .",
    "to specify a multi - agent system , one begins with the possible internal states of the agents .",
    "since our model builds on that of bouchaud and mzard  @xcite , each of our agents will have its internal state specified by a real positive variable , hereafter called its `` wealth '' .",
    "agents see their internal state change with time : their wealth will fluctuate because of returns on investments on the one hand and because of exchange of goods against currency on the other ; such exchanges or `` trades '' lead to outflux ( from purchases ) and influx ( from sales ) .",
    "trades are only performed between linked agents ; these links are either set a priori ( `` quenched '' or frozen network ) or are dynamic as in adaptive networks .",
    "we now explain in detail the dynamics of these two parts of our model .",
    "( similar ideas have been formulated independently in ref.@xcite , but , to our knowledge , have not been further developed . )      our system has a fixed number @xmath0 of agents , whose state at time @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 .",
    "the change in wealth of an agent takes into account trades and returns on investments . for computational simplicity",
    ", we consider a discrete time stochastic equation  @xcite : @xmath3 where the parameters @xmath4 describe the fraction of agent @xmath5 s wealth which flows to agent @xmath6 as a result of trading at time @xmath1 .",
    "the change in an agent s wealth is also affected by the return on investments in stock - markets , currency exchange rates , housing or commodity prices etc .",
    "these investments lead to gains or losses , providing multiplicative changes ; if for example a stock price changes by two percent , then the value of a portfolio allocated in that stock will change by two percent .",
    "we model the fluctuations by the term @xmath7 which is taken to be a stationary gaussian variable : @xmath8    without the random factors @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) , the total wealth of the system would be conserved ; their presence implies that the total wealth typically grows exponentially with time , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "note that wealth is a relative concept , i.e. , independent of the unit of currency used to measure the @xmath10 ; hence , the wealth dynamics must be invariant under the scale transformation @xmath11 it is evident that this requirement is satisfied by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) .",
    "let us denote by @xmath12 the adjacency matrix of the graph representing the linking of agents and let us assume , for simplicity , that this graph is undirected , i.e. @xmath13 . in ref .",
    "@xcite bouchaud and mzard have studied in detail the large time behavior in the class of models where @xmath14 , with a constant proportionality factor @xmath15 , where the graph is time independent .",
    "they limited their study to fully connected graphs ( the model is then analytically solvable ) and to sparse random ( erds - rnyi ) graphs . they have shown that in both cases the system tends to a steady state where wealth distribution has a power law tail at large ( relative ) wealth values .",
    "furthemore , for sparse random graphs and small enough @xmath15 the tail becomes sufficiently fat to lead to the `` wealth condensation '' phenomenon : a finite number of agents hold a finite fraction of the total wealth , even in the large @xmath0 limit .    in this paper we propose a two - fold generalization of the study summarized above .",
    "first , we will consider highly inhomogeneous graphs .",
    "this is motivated by the empirical observation that graphs encountered in nature are very often inhomogeneous .",
    "for example , scale - free fat tails of the degre distribution are ubiquitous .",
    "it is easy to see that for highly inhomogeneous graphs assuming a simple proportionality relation @xmath16 is untenable .",
    "indeed , the loss term in ( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) would then dominate over the income term when @xmath10 is large and the rich agents would therefore prefer to have as few trading partners as possible , contrary to common sense .",
    "we will assume that all agents trade with the same `` activity '' @xmath15 , which is constant in time .",
    "this means that the total outgoing flow of wealth from the agent @xmath5 equals @xmath17 ; in effect , each agent allocates a fixed _ fraction _",
    "@xmath15 of its wealth to trading , a reasonable hypothesis when considering life - styles in developped countries .    for each agent @xmath5",
    ", we shall assume that its outflow of trades ( purchases ) is equally distributed over all agents @xmath6 it trades with .",
    "thus , the matrix @xmath18 reduces to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of agents trading with @xmath5 .",
    "we have checked , keeping the topology of the graph quenched ( inhomogeneous by construction ) , that with eq.([ja ] ) the average wealth is a monotonically increasing function of the node degree : rich agents tend to have many trading partners .",
    "the second generalization we propose concerns the topology of the graph , which will no longer be assumed frozen . on the contrary",
    ", it will adapt itself to the demands of agents .",
    "we now discuss this point in detail .",
    "the `` interactions '' between agents are their connections , i.e. , the support for their mutual trades .",
    "the corresponding network depends on the internal state of the agents themselves , and thus the links between agents are dynamical : they can be added or removed over time . to specify these dynamics",
    ", we shall model the time evolution of the adjacency matrix @xmath21 , which is now assumed to be time dependent : @xmath22 if at time @xmath1 the agents @xmath5 and @xmath6 can trade with each other and @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "we have to define the dynamics for the graph evolution @xmath24 .",
    "to model its dependence on wealth distribution , we propose a preferential trading rule , according to which the probability of establishing a new trade connection between two agents is roughly proportional to the wealth of each agent .",
    "to turn this rule into a probabilistic recipe one has to define a quantity in the range @xmath25 $ ] which can be interpreted as a probability . instead of @xmath26 , we will use normalized quantities which express the wealth of agents in units of the current mean value of the wealth in the ensemble : @xmath27 clearly @xmath28 is invariant under the scale transformation eq .",
    "( [ scaletransf ] ) .",
    "the position , or solvency , of the agent in the system is better reflected by its normalized wealth than by its absolute wealth . in these units",
    "the mean value of wealth is by construction always equal to unity , @xmath29 . in our wealth",
    "preferential trading rule , the probability of establishing a new trading connection , @xmath30 , increases with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is some proportionality factor .",
    "the only problem is that even if @xmath32 is small , this quantity may exceed one for large @xmath33 and @xmath34 and thus loose a probabilistic interpretation . to avoid this pathology",
    "we set : @xmath35 of course trade connections between agents do not necessarily exist for ever .",
    "we allow in our model for the possibility of abandoning an existing trade connection , @xmath36 . for simplicity we shall assume that the probability of breaking the trade or equivalently of removing an existing link between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is constant in time and independent of the agents wealth : @xmath37 taken together , eqs .",
    "( [ add])-([rem ] ) along with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) define an adaptive network , preserving the property of invariance under eq .",
    "( [ scaletransf ] ) of the original bouchaud - mzard model .",
    "the model is now formulated . as will be seen",
    ", it displays a very interesting pattern of adaptation of the network topology to the wealth distribution and vice versa .",
    "before we discuss these properties , let us first consider the limiting cases in which only one sector is active while the other is quenched : ( a ) the network topology evolves according to the dynamics described above while the wealth distribution is quenched ; ( b ) the wealth distribution evolves according to the dynamics described above while the network topology is quenched .",
    "assume now that the distribution of wealth is constant during the evolution of the network .",
    "the process of adding and removing links between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be viewed as a two - state markov chain . since the weights are constant in time @xmath38 , the probability of adding the link @xmath39 ( cf .",
    ".  [ add ] ) is constant as well .",
    "similarly , the probability of removing the link @xmath39 is constant ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ rem ] )",
    ". one can then easily determine the stationary probability for this markov chain ; one finds that for this stationary distribution the probability that there is a link between nodes @xmath5 and @xmath6 equals @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "assume that the weights @xmath33 are independent identically distributed random numbers with some probability distribution @xmath42 such that the mean is 1 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "in this case one can easily see that the total expected number of links of the network can be bounded from above : @xmath44 we used the fact that the denominator of @xmath45 is by construction equal or larger than one and @xmath46 .",
    "additionally if the coefficient @xmath47 is inversely proportional to the number of nodes , i.e. , @xmath48 , the network will be sparse and the expected number of links will approach the upper bound given in ( [ upl ] ) in the limit @xmath49 because the denominator will tend to one .",
    "thus , the mean connectivity of the network is expected to be @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath52 the probability ( [ pij ] ) that there is a link between a pair of vertices @xmath5 and @xmath6 is for all practical purposes the same as in the park - newman model  @xcite , so we expect that the two models will behave similarly for small @xmath53 , and in fact we have checked that this is indeed the case .",
    "it is known from the considerations of park and newman @xcite that if @xmath33 are independent identically distributed random numbers with a probability distribution having for large @xmath54 a scale - free tail @xmath55 with @xmath56 then the node degree distribution also exhibits the scale - free behaviour @xmath57 ( in a range of values of @xmath58 ) provided the network is sparse .",
    "this is what we observe too .",
    "the original park - newman model used the concept of fitness , closer in spirit to the unnormalized weights @xmath10 rather than the normalized ones @xmath33 ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "the main difference between the two frameworks is that the average fitness @xmath59 for the ensemble of @xmath0 numbers @xmath10 , @xmath60 may differ from ensemble to ensemble while for the normalized weights by construction it is always constant @xmath61 . in effect , if one substitutes @xmath54 s by @xmath62 s and @xmath63 in ( [ pij ] ) and neglects @xmath53 to get the original park - newman model , one obtains a simple relation between the two definitions of @xmath47 : @xmath64 note that in the park - newman model , @xmath65 is constant ; then the above identification leads to a @xmath47 that fluctuates from event to event as a result of the fluctuations of the average @xmath59 .    for large @xmath0 , by virtue of the central limit theorem",

    ", @xmath59 is a lvy random number whose probable deviations from the mean are of order @xmath70 , finally , for @xmath71 , @xmath59 is a lvy random number of order @xmath72 , subject to enormous fluctuations . in other words ,",
    "as long as @xmath56 , the park - newman construction and ours differ for large @xmath0 by a trivial rescaling ( [ eff_beta ] ) , while for @xmath71 the mapping breaks down .",
    "our network evolution has been defined using `` computer '' time .",
    "hence , if @xmath73 denotes the unit of the physical time , the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath53 are both proportional to @xmath73 .",
    "however , as was shown above , as long as @xmath52 the relevant control parameter of the model , as far as the topology of the network is concerned , is the ratio @xmath41 , which is insensitive to the value of @xmath73 . however , the value of @xmath53 controls the rate of updates of the algorithm and , therefore , the autocorrelations during the history of a computer simulation .",
    "we set @xmath74 in our numerical work , considering @xmath32 as the relevant adjustable parameter .",
    "now assume that the network is fixed during the evolution of weights : @xmath75 . in this case",
    "@xcite ) eq .  ( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) has a continuous time limit under a proper scaling of the parameters of the model .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the physical time and set @xmath77 in the limit @xmath78 one gets from ( [ eq : wdynamics ] ) together with ( [ ja ] ) the following stochastic equations ( in the stratonovich sense ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a @xmath0-dimensional wiener process . dividing both sides by @xmath81 and rescaling the time variable @xmath82 one sees that at large time the only relevant parameter is @xmath83 .",
    "we simulate the model on a computer using its discrete formulation .",
    "however , we try to be close to the continuous time limit , setting @xmath73 very small ( in our runs we used @xmath84 ) .",

    "notice , that for @xmath91 the stationary solution does not exist , and therefore the limit @xmath92 is singular .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite have also shown , using numerical simulations , that for sparse random erds - rnyi graphs , one again gets a fat tail but with an exponent @xmath93 smaller than one if @xmath83 is smaller than a certain critical value .",
    "we have repeated these simulations in our version of the model for a sample of network topologies .",
    "we observe that the fat tail always emerges and that the corresponding exponent depends weakly on network topology ( see later ) .",
    "the occurence of such a fat tail with @xmath71 in the wealth distribution has consequences that we now discuss in detail .",
    "let us carefully study the consequences of using the normalized @xmath54 s instead of @xmath62 s ( our discussion is inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the sake of simplicity , but without any real loss of generality , assume that the probability distribution of @xmath62 is ( we omit the index @xmath5 for simplicity of writing ) : @xmath94 and zero otherwise .",
    "assume first that @xmath56 so that the mean @xmath67 is well defined .",
    "we want to calculate the probability distribution of the scaled variable defined in ( [ ww ] ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the sum of remaining terms . for large @xmath0 one can replace @xmath99 by its mean value @xmath100 , where @xmath101 . after trivial",

    "the above distribution has natural cut - offs , as expected .",
    "in addition to the behavior @xmath106 inherited from ( [ rho0 ] ) it involves a factor @xmath107 suppressing @xmath54 s of order @xmath0 .",
    "the lower cut - off @xmath108 is finite as long as @xmath56 . for @xmath109 ,",
    "one has to redo the analysis .",
    "let us observe that strictly speaking @xmath110 is not fixed but fluctuates .",
    "hovever , when @xmath56 its departures from the average can be neglected when @xmath0 is large enough .",

    ": instead @xmath99 scales as @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is some constant , which shall be calculated below .",
    "so in this case the lower cut - off @xmath115 in ( [ rho ] ) is @xmath116 as one can see by inserting @xmath117 on the right hand side of ( [ s ] ) .",
    "the cut - off goes to zero as @xmath118 , but for any finite @xmath0 it is finite .",
    "it is essential to keep it finite while calculating the integral @xmath119 since otherwise the singularity @xmath120 at zero would make the integral ( [ rho ] ) diverge . with @xmath121 ( for @xmath71 )",

    "this means if one makes a fixed - bin histogram of @xmath33 s for large @xmath0 , then almost all @xmath33 s will be in the first bin adjacent to zero .",
    "this phenomenon can be called a `` poverty condensation '' .",
    "another surprising feature of the wealth distribution when @xmath71 is that the factor @xmath107 does not introduce a suppression of @xmath54 of order @xmath0 , but an enhancement .",
    "the singularity at @xmath132 is integrable .",
    "intuitively this means that in a large sample of @xmath33 s , most values are concentrated at zero , but a few remaining ones are of order @xmath0 .",
    "this is also what one can infer from the calculation of the inverse participation ratio @xmath133  @xcite . for @xmath118 @xmath134",

    "this shows that in a large sample of @xmath33 s a finite fraction of them is of order @xmath0 .",
    "this is the `` wealth condensation '' signaled by bouchaud and mzard .",
    "notice , that poverty and wealth condensation occur simultaneously .",
    "the above discussion refers to simple sampling of @xmath33 s .",
    "now let the agent s wealth be dynamic ( but still keeping the geometry frozen ) .",

    "one example of this is the coupling of matter and geometry in theories of gravity .",
    "network nodes involve `` matter '' fields while the network links describe the curved geometry of interactions .",
    "the theory involves coupling constants which specify the dynamical time scales of matter and geometry degrees of freedom . comparing to our agent based model ,",
    "matter is analogous to wealth and geometry is described by the network topology .    for our adaptive network model of agents , how should one set the two time scales ? as pointed out in a recent review @xcite , in most models studied so far the wealth changes either much faster or much more slowly than the geometry .",
    "we wish to have the two time scales be comparable . once the value of @xmath73 has been chosen , the rate of wealth updates is fixed .",
    "as already mentioned , the rate of geometry updates is controlled by the parameter @xmath32 or equivalently @xmath53 . to compare the two rates , we have randomized the system and",
    "then let it evolve keeping the wealth or the geometry quenched .",
    "we found that ( with our choice of @xmath73 and @xmath53 ) the autocorrelation length for wealth is two orders of magnitude larger than for geometry .",
    "consequently , in the simulations of the coupled system we alternate 1 sweep of the geometry with 100 sweeps of the wealth ( and there are about ten updates of the whole system within one autocorelation time interval ) .",
    "the physical control parameters are @xmath137 and @xmath47 .",
    "actually , as will be seen , the choice of @xmath47 has little influence on the wealth distribution ; it controls the average degree of the network .",
    "the degree distribution itself turns out to have a smooth dependence on @xmath47 when it is plotted versus the scaled variable @xmath148 . on the other hand",
    "the value taken by @xmath137 is essential for the behavior of the system .",
    "the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ ja ] ) generates a positive correlation between the degree of a node and the wealth stored in this node .",
    "one can suspect that this leads to a breakdown of ergodicity for heterogeneous networks . and indeed , ergodicity is broken as long as the geometry is quenched : if at a certain moment a given agent is the poorest ( richest ) it never becomes the richest ( poorest ) during the run history .",
    "we have found , however , that the ergodicity is restored when wealth and links get coupled . in a sense , this coupling increases the `` social mobility '' .",
    "the poverty condensation has dramatic consequences when one couples wealth to geometry .",
    "as soon as one enters the regime where the wealth distribution develops a fat tail with @xmath111 , nearly all nodes become progressively isolated ( have zero degree ) and all wealth becomes the property of a tiny minority .",
    "a modification of the rules is called for , either for wealth ( welfare ) or for connectivity ( not considered here ) .",
    "we impose a lower cut - off on @xmath10 s viz . @xmath149 . since we work with scaled variables @xmath33 and",
    "since we recalculate them after each wealth update , the @xmath33 s inherit a similar cut - off , except that it somewhat smeared around @xmath150 . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : wealthfattailsquenched ] we show the wealth distribution for quenched networks when this cut - off is imposed ; no collapse is possible there .",
    "hence , a calculation with and without cut - off can be compared and one notices that the fat tail appears in both cases , although the exponent @xmath93 is a little larger when the cut - off is present . when the network is adaptive , the cut - off prevents the collapse .      before presenting more datailed data on the wealth and degree distributions and on the correlation between the two ,",
    "let us have a general view of the model s properties .    with an ongoing trading activity and link changes , the system evolves and empirically always seems to reach a steady state that is unique ( independent of the initial conditions ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a smooth large volume limit .",
    "it is most instructive to examine the dependence of the inverse participation ratio @xmath133 defined in eq .",
    "( [ invparticip ] ) versus @xmath83 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : y2w ] ) .",
    "the qualitative behavior is similar to that observed in the bouchaud - mzard model .",
    "( for completeness we show also in the figure the data corresponding to a calculation with quenched random network . )",
    "we find that @xmath133 is finite as long as @xmath83 is small enough , it falls progressively as @xmath83 increases and eventually settles at a value of order @xmath151 when @xmath83 is increases beyond a certain critical value .",
    "notice that an increase of @xmath47 from @xmath152 to @xmath153 has very little effect .",

    "furthermore , we find that @xmath165 does not go below @xmath166 so no node carries a finite fraction of all links .",
    "this can be referred to as lack of `` link condensation '' .",
    "one can define @xmath133 for the degree distribution by replacing @xmath167 in the defining equality in ( [ invparticip ] ) ( notice that @xmath168 ) .",
    "one finds that this @xmath133 is typically one order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding parameter for the wealth .",
    "now we focus on the properties of the agents wealth .",
    "we saw that when the network was quenched , a fat tail appeared generically so it will come as no surprise that in the adaptive network model the distribution of wealth @xmath169 again has power law tails .",

    "it turns out , however , that the system is actually subject to very large fluctuations , for instance for the total wealth , and that these fluctuations are much larger than those observed when the geometry is kept quenched .",
    "this can be traced back to the slow fall - off of the wealth distribution : with such @xmath33 s the link dynamics of sect .",
    "[ subsect_links ] necessarily generates networks with strongly fluctuating number of links .",

    "@xmath176 and @xmath155.,width=302 ]    what is even more interesting , one observes a strong ( anti)correlation between the wealth inverse participation ratio and the total number of links ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : y2vsl ] ) .",
    "the periods of relatively low participation ratio and large number of inter - node connections alternate with periods where participation ratio is large and the number of links small .",
    "increasing the number of trading links apparently reduces `` social disparities '' .",
    "of course , this remark should not be taken too seriously , the frequency of the regime changes is too rapid to be an image of the behavior of actual markets",
    ". however , the trend is of interest .",
    "we have introduced a class of models in which agents perform trades and influence the associated network of interactions .",
    "we find that these adaptive network systems spontaneously go to a unique steady state , and that several very distinct behaviors arise depending on the parameters defining the models .",
    "when no lower cut - off is imposed on agent wealth , the poor go into a spiral of poverty and disconnect from the network which `` collapses '' ; furthermore this is a cascading process so that rapidly nearly all individuals reach this situation . when instead a minimum wealth is enforced , the overall system reaches a critical state where wealth and connectivity distributions have power - law tails ; this critical behavior is generic , no fine tuning of parameters is necessary . in this critical steady state ,",
    "the heterogeneity or `` differences '' in agent wealth depends on the trade intensity , parametrized in our model by a coupling @xmath83 . for large @xmath83 ,",
    "the wealth circulates rapidly , and differences in wealth are small . on the contrary when @xmath83 is small , wealth differences are large , and in fact for @xmath83 small enough , one goes into a `` condensed '' phase where a finite fraction of the wealth is held by just a few agents .",
    "interestingly , we find this phase transition point to be the same as when the network is quenched according to any law for the degree distribution .",
    "not surprisingly , we have also found that the wealth and the network dynamics lead to large correlated fluctuations ; in particular , the total wealth tends to be lowest when the network is the densest .",
    "the occurence of power laws in wealth distributions , usually referred to as pareto s law  @xcite , has been empirically observed in many economic contexts . since such systems almost always involve adaptive networks , it would be of major interest to extend those observations to the properties of the underlying networks .",
    "our model suggests not only that these networks will be characterized by power laws , but that the wealth and network properties will be strongly correlated . in situations where",
    "regulation of such behavior is considered necessary , policies may focus on the network `` rules '' rather than attempting to regulate wealth directly ; these policies might involve introducing fees or subsidies for different kinds of trades .",
    "clearly in realistic situations , there may be other features to take into account such as geographic influences on the adaptive network dynamics .",
    "one may have to also consider social trends such as spontaneous assortativity formation in trading networks .",
    "it seems to us in particular that sufficient assortativity may prevent the spiral of poverty formation when no minimum wealth is imposed .",
    "more generally , many of these issues extend far beyond economic adaptive networks : food - webs , transportation networks , or social networks all lead to similar questions .",
