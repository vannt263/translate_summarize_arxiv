    "many efforts have gone into application of machine learning techniques on fmri derived brain network parameters for classification of schizophrenia with higher accuracy  @xcite .    in this study we investigated bfns constructed from fmri data of schizophrenia subjects and healthy subjects",
    "so as to identify higher order topological features that characterize the disease . starting with dataset provided by center for biomedical research excellence ( cobre ) , we constructed bfn models for their graph theoretical investigations . towards identification of key distinguishing network features of schizophrenia",
    ", we exhaustively investigated 17 and 28 first order derived network features of binary ( unweighted ) and weighted bfns , as well as their higher order tuples .",
    "we believe that features thus identified could be effectively used for semi - automated diagnosis of schizophrenia , and may further be used for early detection protocol .",
    "for investigating systems - level differences in brain activity of healthy subjects and pre - diagnosed schizophrenic patients we used the cobre dataset .",
    "this dataset , obtained from international neuroimaging data - sharing initiative under 1000 functional connectomes project , comprised of fmri data of 148 subjects . out of which 74 were healthy subjects ( controls ) and 72 were patients prediagnosed with schizophrenia and 2 subjects ( 0040070 and 0040083 ) were marked as disenrolled , with age groups ranging from 18 to 65 years in all classes . in initial steps of preprocessing , it was found that 2 subjects ( 0040075 and 0040126 ) had discrepancies in their data ( time points 67 - 149 were not available and the data was of high frequency nature respectively ) which led their removal from the subjects under study . with this , there were 70 patients and 74 healthy controls .",
    "the patients were pre - diagnosed with schizophrenia based on ` structured clinical interview ' used for dsm disorders .",
    "echo - planar imaging was used for resting state fmri data collection with ( repetition time ) tr=2s , ( echo time ) te=29ms , matrix size :  64@xmath164 , slices=32 , voxel size=3@xmath13@xmath14 mm@xmath2 .",
    "the fmri data is a 4-dimensional metadata comprising of information from spatial and temporal dimensions of blood oxygen - level dependent activities under resting state of the brain .",
    "we implemented a protocol to preprocess fmri data as described in 1000 functional connectome project  @xcite . to convert preprocessed raw fmri data we decomposed 4-d data into spatial and time series components using ica and creating functional graphs from the components by forming corelation matrix  @xcite .",

    "the corrected recording from each voxel was obtained by shifting images from each slice with respect to the reference image . to eliminate extra tissue around the brain skull stripping",
    "was performed , this is done by expanding spherical surface to envelop the brain and exclude rest of the tisues .",
    "this step was then followed by smoothing and filtering steps , which include spatial smoothing and temporal filtering to remove high frequencies enhancing low frequencies . to reduce the noisy signals we used grand - mean scaling for normalising the data and applying band - pass filtering .",
    "the lowpass and highpass cut - off frequency was set to 0.1 hz and 0.005 hz respectively using fast fourier transform of the data . to focus on fluctuations in the signal , removal of linear and quadratic trends",

    "this brain data had to be registered in accordance with standard brain for which we used linear registration process .",
    "segmenatation was performed over the data to acquire information about grey matter , white matter and cerebro spinal fluid in brain .",

    "spatial ica was employed to decompose fmri data into a set of maximally spatially independent maps and their corresponding time - courses .",
    "these time - courses show considerable amount of time - dependencies between distinct functional activities captured in various components , indicating their potential for use in functional network connectivity analysis .",
    "the time - courses , that measure time - varying activity of components , were used for further analysis .",
    "these components represent spatially independent functional activities of the brain under resting state .",
    "the ica of fmri data was implemented using fsl .",
    "brain functional network is a complex networks model of brain where a node represents ` spatially ' independent functional activity extracted with ica and an edge specifies the ` extent ' of temporal dependency between the nodes. temporal dependencies between functional activities were measured by finding correlations between them .",
    "dependencies were computed using a correlation based distance metric that is a transformation of the maximal absolute cross - correlation between two time - series .",
    "correlations were calculated for each pair of nodes using cross - correlation function ( ccf ) over a range of temporal lags ,    @xmath20}{\\sqrt{e[(x_{\\mu_i , t } - \\overline{x_{\\mu_i}})^2]e[(x_{\\mu_j , t } - \\overline{x_{\\mu_j}})^2]}}\\ ] ]     + where , @xmath21 , @xmath22 are time series of @xmath23 and @xmath24 components , @xmath25 is the temporal lag between them and varied from 0 to 3 points ( total 6 seconds with an interval of 2 seconds ) .",
    "the distance matrix dist(@xmath21 , @xmath22 ) was determined by subtracting maximal absolute ccf from 1 and is given by ,    @xmath26\\ ] ]    this distance signifies temporal similarity between two components ; the higher the distance lesser the correlation .",
    "the distance matrix , thus calculated , represents the weighted brain functional network of a subject .",
    "the weighted bfn was further pruned to remove weak connections on the basis of k - nearest neighbor approach where k was chosen as 10@xmath0 of total components of the subject or 2 , whichever was maximum .",
    "this pruned bfn was used for computation of graph theoretical parameters . while the graph creation was implemented by @xmath27 programming language  @xcite , computation of graph theoretical metric",
    "was done in matlab .",
    "[ fig_flowchart ] shows the strategy implemented to obtain bfn of each subject and for its graph theoretical characterization .",
    "binary bfns were obtained by thresholding the weighted bfns .",
    "the threshold was chosen on trial and error basis such that a single component network is maintained .",
    "following network parameters were computed on both the binary as well as weighted bfns for each subject : degree , edge density , node betweenness , edge betweenness , clustering coefficient , characteristic pathlength , efficiency , modularity , closeness , coreness , eccentricity and weak ties .",
    "this study was aimed at identification of network parameters that play crucial role in discriminating bfns of schizophrenia subjects from those of controls . towards this end",
    "we computed higher order statistics ( mean , median and standard deviation ) for the above mentioned network parameters .",
    "we obtained 28 and 17 such statistical features for weighted and binary bfns , respectively .",
    "table  s1 in supplementary material provides an exhaustive list of all network derived features .",
    "the bfns were classified into schizophrenic and control subjects on the basis of the network features derived from weighted as well as binary bfns .",
    "support vector machine ( svm ) was used as a classifier with radial basis function as its kernel function . when trained with features of bfns along with their predefined classes",
    ", svm can classify test cases of bfns .",
    "the performance of svm classification was assessed with 10-fold cross validation statistics .",
    "we investigated the feature set consisting of individual network features ( of weighted and binary bfns ) as well as their 2 - 8 and 2 - 6 combinations with a total of 144 subjects .",
    "combinations with more than 8 and 6 networks features were not only computationally challenging ( @xmath28 n is the number of features and c is the order of feature combination ) but were also found to be redundant towards identification of optimal feature set in binary and weighted bfns respectively . to identify topological features of bfns with potential for accurate classification between schizophrenia and healthy subjects by an exhaustive search of network features and their higher combinations",
    "we did not exclude any feature .",
    "investigation of each feature s contribution towards classification was carried out by enumerating the features appearance in best 100 accuracies within each feature combinations ( 2 - 8 in binary bfns and 2 - 6 weighted bfns ) .",
    "brain functional networks represent systems model of brain functional activities .",
    "[ fig_graphflow ] depicts detailed process used for creation of bfns starting from raw fmri data .",
    "the raw fmri data was pre - processed to obtain a filtered fmri signal which was further decomposed into spatially independent components to fetch time - series for each component using ica . using time - series data in components , correlation based normalized distance matrix was calculated .",
    "this matrix was transformed into weighted and binary adjacency matrices , which represent the network of independent components .",
    "these networks have @xmath29 average number of nodes and @xmath30 average number of edges between them , thus making graph theoratical properties comparable .",
    "various graph theoretical properties of bfns were further computed so as to generate a unique feature set to be used for classification ( table  s1 of supplementary material ) .",
    "these final features set comprised of combinations of one to eight features derived from binary and upto combinations of one to six features for weighted bfns . the classification between healthy and schizophrenic subjects was performed with the help of these feature sets .              towards identification of topological biomarkers of schizophrenia , we investigated network features derived from bfns of patients and healthy controls .",
    "[ mixed_networks ] illustrate differences between healthy and schizophrenic subjects with the help of distance matrices and weighted bfns created in synchronization with a topological property ( clustering coefficient ) .",
    "the differences that are almost indiscernible at the level of distance matrices , become more apparent when seen through the lens of topological features .",
    "first , a feature set using individual parameters was created .",
    "for weighted and binary bfns 28 and 17 such parameters were independently trained and tested in the classifier .",
    "motivated with the idea of creating a better feature set that could potentially enhance the ability to distinguish between correlations across the bfns , we created combinations ranging from 2 to 6 parameters for weighted and 2 to 8 parameters for binary bfns .",
    "interestingly , the classification performance for higher order feature combination was much better than that of individual features .",
    "we increased the order of combination until the accuracies were declining or the number of combinations become exponantially large . to identify the contribution of each feature in combinations ,",
    "top 100 accuracies were fetched from each set and their individual contributions were calculated over all combinations .      among the 17 binary and 28 weighted bfns features , the features whose combined contribution was more than 50@xmath0 in classifying healthy and schizophrenic subjects are shown in  [ binary_weighted ] for ( a ) binary and ( b ) weighted bfns . maximum matching index and",
    "maximum modularity were among the few topological features that contributed significantly to classification accuracy in binary and weighted networks respectively .",
    "matching index quantifies similarity between two nodes connectivity profiles , excluding their mutual connection .",
    "modularity quantifies the degree to which the network may be subdivided into delineated groups .",
    "the difference in networks belonging to two categories support the hypothesis that recognizes schizophrenia as a disorder of dysfunctional integration between distant brain regions  @xcite . while the ability to consistently classify schizophrenia bfns from that of healthy subject may be limited with single features , we anticipated better efficacy for higher order ( @xmath31 ) features .",
    "experiments of @xmath32-cross fold tests . ]",
    "it was observed that increasing the order of feature combinations yields improvement over individual or pairwise sets .",
    "this trend continues till combination of 8 and 6 for binary and weighted bfns respectively .",
    "[ fig_accuracy_trend ] summarizes the effectiveness of higher order combinations of network features .",
    "the figure shows the trend in highest average accuracy with increasing number of features in the feature set .",
    "improved classification accuracy was observed with increased order of features upto 8 combinations in binary bfns and 6 combinations in weighted bfns .",
    "interestingly , features extracted from weighted bfns yielded better classification accuracy than those from binary bfns . with increased complexity of features the accuracy , after initial increase , plateaued .",
    "increased redundancy was observed among the top features obtained .",
    "brain functional networks , graph theoretical models of brain activity data , provide macro - level understanding of complex functional connectivity in the brain  @xcite . functional networks of brains ink pathological conditions , such as schizophrenia , have been reported to have altered properties quantifiable in terms of topological features ( for eg . : low average clustering , long characteristic pathlength , lower degree of connectivity , lower strength of connectivity and reduced modularity )  @xcite .",
    "such disruptions of topological features are understood to be an indication of dysfunctionality in schizophrenic bfns as studied in fmri scans of dorsal and ventral prefrontal , anterior cingulate , and posterior cortical regions  @xcite .",
    "here , we performed an exhaustive investigation of graph theoretical features of binary and weighted bfns and their higher order combinations towards classification of bfns of schizophrenia and healthy subjects .",
    "one of the objectives of our study was to assess the utility of increased order of features on classification accuracy .",
    "other than that we also aimed to identify network metrics and their possible implication for altered brain functional patterns .",
    "our study provides some of the key features that can play an important role in characterizing schizophrenia .",
    "et al . _ had shown that small - world organization in brain networks of schizophrenic patients are significantly altered in many brain regions with decreased clustering and increased characteristic path length  @xcite .",
    "beyond disrupted small world nature , our study presents other properties that may be associated with bfns of dysfunctional schizophrenic phenotype . weighted bfns of schizophrenia subjects were distinct in terms of maximized modularity , sum of product of degrees across all edges , vertex eccentricity and betweenness . on the other hand , binary bfns presented matching index , edge overlap , edge betweenness , assortativity and global efficiency among the best features that could be used for classification of schizophrenia patients from healthy subjects .",
    "broadly these properties reflect on connectivity , modularity and hierarchical organization of the network .",
    "one of the highest accuracies reported with bfn - based models equals 65@xmath0 as reported by anderson and cohen  @xcite .",
    "although , the classification accuracies achieved in our study were not exemplary , our study highlights the role of topological features derived from weighted bfns for classification of schizophrenia fmri data .",
    "the study also underlines limits on higher order feature combinations indicating saturation of classification accuracy .",
    "specific network features obtained from our study could further be used for designing better disease classification algorithms as well as early detection systems .",
    "our study suggests that instead of exhaustive search for features through higher order combinations of features ( n - tuples ) appropriate use of feature selection methods could be the way forward .",
    "the insights gained from our study into network biomarkers and limitations of higher order features could be used for efficient design of computational protocols for diagnose of schizophrenia at an early stage .",
