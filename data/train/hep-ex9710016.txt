    "two key elements of @xmath5 physics measurement at the slac linear collider ( slc ) have made possible a set of unique precision electroweak tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "highly longitudinally polarized electron beams directly probe the parity - violating nature of electroweak physics , greatly enhancing the measurement of key parameters such as @xmath9 and @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , the inherent interaction point properties of linear @xmath10 colliders , namely a tiny and very stable interaction region and a low collision rate , have allowed the sld experiment to push the technique of precision vertexing to a new level .",
    "these assets have enabled sld to make a set of sm tests at comparable precision to those of lep , while using largely independent measurement techniques .",
    "-0.1 in the production and transport of longitudinally polarized electron beams at slc has been discussed in detail elsewhere@xcite .",
    "polarized electrons are photoproduced from a strained gaas cathode by means of circularly polarized laser light with @xmath11 nm .",
    "the sign of the laser polarization is controlled such that it follows a pseudo - random pulse - by - pulse sequence .",
    "before the electron beam enters its damping ring , the polarization is rotated into the vertical by means of a @xmath12 t - m solenoidal field .",
    "as it turns out , the wavelength of betatron oscillations of the collider arc is very nearly equal to the distance for electron spin - precession .",
    "hence , spin precession in a non - bend plane can accumulate during the normal arc focussing - defocussing beam transport .",
    "this allows the vertical polarization at the end of the linac to become longitudinal at the collision point by means of the beam `` launch '' in position and angle at the entrance to the arc .",
    "the launch can be carefully tuned at the same time that polarization measurements at sld are made .",
    "a thorough optimization is carried out in this way during initial running setup , and is subsequently checked and re - optimized periodically during the run .",
    "occasionally , changes of beam orbit in the arc due to normal accelerator tuning lead to small changes in polarization ( @xmath13 ) with timescales of hours .",
    "meanwhile , polarization measurements are performed every 3 minutes during normal data taking , with each measurement having statistical resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , any modulations in polarization are recorded and applied to the corresponding ( in time ) @xmath5 events .",
    "a summary of the polarization measurement and systematic effects is given below in the @xmath15 section .",
    "the electron and positron beams at slc are each focussed at the collision point to a typical size of @xmath16 m .",
    "this allows for a small - diameter beampipe and vertex detectors which can be placed close to the collision point , thus reducing extrapolation error .",
    "equally important is the fact that the collision point is very stable .",
    "its transverse movement is usually less than a few microns between measurements of the position , which requires a few tens of @xmath5 events . the resulting accuracy for determining the interaction point position is @xmath17 @xmath18 m in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xmath18 m in @xmath22 .",
    "not only does this significantly improve the precision for measuring decay lengths or impact parameters , it also means that particles which decay after short flight paths can be separated from the primary interaction point . besides improving the efficiency for tagging @xmath2-quark and @xmath23-quark flavored hadrons and @xmath24 leptons ,",
    "the @xmath5 decay modes involving these final states can be vetoed to allow studies of enhanced samples of @xmath5 decays to @xmath25 and @xmath26 quarks .",
    "the latter principle of light - flavor tagging has used at sld for qcd measurements , but is not discussed further here .",
    "the low 120 hz collision rate at slc opens a window of opportunity for exploiting an intrinsic 3-d pixel technology for the vertex detector .",
    "in particular , ccd - based detectors have been developed and utilized for sld , starting with vxd2 in 1992 .",
    "-0.1 in full realization of the physics potential of the ccd - based vxd2 vertex detector was achieved after a few years of experience .",
    "it soon became clear that an improved detector , exploiting the rapid improvement in commercially available ccds , could be made .",
    "the most obvious characteristic of the upgrade to vxd3 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vxd3-geom ] , namely the expanded coverage both transversly and longitudinally .",
    "this was made feasible because it had become possible to fabricate individual ccds of much larger size .",
    "the transverse geometry was improved in two major aspects : the layout of the ccd ladders was configured such that all tracks would have three good hits , one in each of the three layers .",
    "secondly , the expanded distance between layers provides an improved resolution for track extrapolation inward to the collision point and outward to match the tracks found in the central drift chamber . from the righthand diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : vxd3-geom ] it is clear that vxd3 also extends the coverage in @xmath27 significantly , with the 3-hit and 2-hit vertexing capability extending to @xmath28 of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "this is a substantial improvement relative to vxd2 and has important physics implications , particularly with regard to the polarized forward - backward @xmath2-quark asymmetry .",
    "the large forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath2 _ vs _ @xmath31 with polarized beam means that the forward coverage is very important not only for the measurement of @xmath3 , but also as an initial - state tag for @xmath32 mixing measurements .",
    "this is discussed later .",
