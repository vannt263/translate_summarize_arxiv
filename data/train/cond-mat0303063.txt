    "another example is a 2d isotropic dilute bose gas with constant particle interaction @xcite . in these cases",
    "the scaling transformation is exact , both for the condensate and the excitations . in the language of qft",
    "this amounts to the fact that there is no particle production in the scaling basis , since the scaling solution is constructed from eigenfunctions of the ( exactly conserved ) scaling transformation operator @xmath130 ( in other words the scaling vacuum is protected by an exact scaling invariance which forbids frequency mixing ) .",
    "the fact that no excitations are produced in the scaling basis does not mean that a lab detector does not detect quasiparticles .",

    "is equivalent to divergence of @xmath135 and is quite restrictive : for the frw analogy discussed above avoiding the divergence implies , according to ( [ ccond ] ) , that * @xmath105 * should not grow faster than linearly . the tp condition ( [ tps ] )",

    "we find that the marginal wkb case corresponds to a logarithmically divergent integral in eq.([tps ] ) .",
    "thus the marginal tp case corresponds to the marginal wkb case and vice versa .    the equation ( [ chin ] ) is formally equivalent to scattering of a non - relativistic particle with energy @xmath138 by a potential @xmath139 .",

    "interestingly , the evolution of the scaling parameters @xmath52 , and therefore the nontrivial line element ( [ blineelement ] ) , can be generated already in a non - expanding cloud with time - dependent interaction @xmath153 .",
    "a similar experiment has been suggested in @xcite , where time dependent interactions were used to simulate frw cosmologies and quantum quasiparticle production .",
    "the difference to our approach is due to the fact that the authors of @xcite consider a trap with very steep walls ( effectively a hard - walled container ) , so that the density of the cloud does not change , and the superfluid velocity vanishes everywhere at all times . in our setup , we are able to induce cosmological quasiparticle production in a harmonically trapped gas , by changing simultaneously the harmonic trapping and the interaction .",

    "the fact that the spectrum is thermal is obtained in @xcite for a specific example with a certain form of the time dependent interaction .",

    "this regularization procedure of course is not limited to density - density correlators only .",

    "the quasiparticle creation in a harmonically trapped superfluid gas , by changing interaction and trapping simultaneously in an appropriate manner , can therefore be described in a general framework , and be interpreted to be analogous to the particle creation occuring during rapid expansion of the cosmos . in particular , it was found that for a readily experimentally available case , the harmonically trapped , dilute superfluid bose gas , a frw type metric can be induced if trapping frequency @xmath187 and interaction coupling @xmath24 are changed such that @xmath188 , without expanding the gas .",
