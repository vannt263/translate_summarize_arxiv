    "scattering processes  photoionization , electron collision , etc .  have been important tools for studying physical systems since the early days of the development of atomic theories .",
    "autoionization , first observed by beutler  @xcite in the photoabsorption of rare gas atoms , is a phenomenon where the energy spectra is characterized by asymmetric resonance peaks , which were explained by fano in his seminal paper in 1961  @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "asymmetric resonance in photoabsorption occurs in the energy region where a discrete state is embedded in the continuum .",
    "photoabsorption populates both the discrete state and the continuum states .",
    "the interaction of the discrete state with the continuum results in the `` autoionization '' of the former , where the discrete state interferes with the directly populated continuum states to form asymmetric beutler - fano profile . today",
    "fano resonances have been used to describe a wealth of physical phenomena in atomic , molecular and optical systems , condensed matter systems@xcite , nanostructures@xcite as well as many other fields .",
    "essential to fano s theory is that each resonance can be characterized by three parameters , the `` unshifted '' resonance position @xmath3 , the shape parameter @xmath4 and the resonance width @xmath5 .",
    "the resonance width characterizes the decay time or the lifetime of the discrete state .",
    "since the typical resonance width of an atomic or molecular system is in the order of 10@xmath6  ev , which corresponds to the lifetime of as short as a few femtoseconds , almost all measurements on these resonances have been carried out in the energy domain , using high - resolution spectroscopy . today a large set of experimental and theoretical data of these resonances have been collected , and they provide important structural information of the systems .    in the past decade , with the advent of laser technology , single attosecond pulses ( sap ) are becoming available@xcite .",
    "such pulses opened up a new research platform for studying electronic dynamics , such as the autoionization dynamics .",
    "indeed , the first sap experiment in atomic system was to determine the lifetime of the auger decay of an @xmath7-shell hole in kr created by extreme vacuum ultraviolet ( xuv ) attosecond pulse by drescher _",
    "et al _  @xcite . for auger decay ,",
    "the resonance profile is mostly symmetric , and thus only the decay width or the lifetime of the inner - shell hole was determined . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the lifetime is determined by creating the inner - shell hole in the presence of an ir laser . by changing the time delay between the xuv pulse with the ir ,",
    "photoelectron spectra can be used to `` deduce '' the lifetime of the inner - shell hole ",
    "based on the approximate `` streaking '' theory@xcite .",
    "such streaking theory has been generalized to fano resonances by zhao and lin  @xcite as well as by others  @xcite .",
    "however , the photoelectron spectra from such xuv+ir setup are very complicated and only the lifetime of the fano resonance can be extracted .    due to the insufficient fluence of the sap s so far , existing measurements using attosecond pulses for auger decay or autoionization have all been carried out using the xuv+ir pump - probe setup where the two pulses actually overlap in time@xcite . rigorously speaking ,",
    "the ir is not probing the resonances created by the attosecond xuv pulse in these experiments since the photoelectron is created in the ir field . with improved technology in attosecond pulse generation and the recent advances in x - ray free - electron lasers ( xfel ) , we envision that intense attosecond pulses will become available in the near future , such that a true time - dependent investigation of the autoionization process will be possible . in this article",
    ", we analyze the time evolution a fano resonance , or the autoionization dynamics of the system in the field - free condition before the discrete state fully decays into the continuum .",
    "for example , if the discrete state has a lifetime of 20 fs while the pump pulse is only 1.5 fs , we ask what is the time evolution of the wave packet associated with the decay process after the pump pulse , and how the energy profile eventually evolves into what is characterized by the fano resonance shape .",
    "we comment that the time evolution of a fano resonance has been studied in several calculations by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation of helium or a model atom  @xcite , with or without the ir probe .",
    "these studies did not address how to retrieve the time evolution of the resonance profiles .",
    "similarly , autoionization of double rydberg states in the time scale of picoseconds has been studied@xcite . in the meanwhile",
    ", the interaction of a doubly excited state with a whole rydberg series also falls into the similar category@xcite .",
    "understanding the time evolution of the two - electron wave packets and the issue of how to probe their evolution lie at the heart of understanding and controlling two - electron dynamics .    in this article , we use two pulses that are separate in time .",
    "the probe is always placed strictly after the pump so that the field - free evolution between the pulses can be defined .",
    "the physical process is understood roughly as the decaying of the bound state to the continuum due to the interaction between them . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , starting with fano theory which is for stationary states , we construct the time - dependent wave function of the system which describes the time evolution of the electron wave packet after the pump pulse .",
    "the wave function is recasted in the basis set of the bound state and the continuum states , where it contains the time information for the bound and the continuum components .",
    "the wave packet for the continuum part is shown to evolve to the typical fano resonance profile at long time .",
    "we thus define the continuum wave packet at short time as the time - dependent fano profile of the autoionization .",
    "since the pump pulse is short , it inevitably spans a broad - band in the energy spectra . assuming that the background energy spectrum generated by the pump is described by a gaussian distribution",
