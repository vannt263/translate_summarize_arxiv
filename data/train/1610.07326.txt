    "interactions of adatoms are a subject of continuous interest , various different interaction mechanisms have been described in detail [ 1 ] .",
    "strain mediated adatom interactions with the basic distance proportionality and the strong influence of the substrates elastic anisotropy were discussed already in the 1970 decade based on elastic continuum theory [ 2,3,4 ] .",
    "also a cutoff method was proposed [ 3 ] to handle the singularity , leading to an attractive interaction at very short range .",
    "elastic interactions appear relevant since many adatom structures reflect the elastic anisotropy of the substrate .",
    "direct measurements of elastic interactions are difficult , so theoretical models seem attractive .",
    "lateral interactions of oxygen adatoms derived from first - principles calculations of the o - pd(100 ) system were claimed to include trio- and quattro terms beside pair interactions [ 5 ] which offers an attractive challenge for testing the reach of elastic models . in a parallel study",
    "the first - principles calculations are interpreted using long - range strain mediated interactions [ 6 ] .",
    "the current analysis is dedicated to extend the earlier model for substrate strain mediated interactions between adatoms [ 3 ] to include trio- and quattro terms .    in the pair model the interaction of adatoms is mediated by their strain fields generated by single adatoms exerting isotropic stress to their vicinity .",
    "isotropic stress is a consequence of adatom locations on sites with 3- or 4-fold symmetry , selected for simplicity . in a lattice description adatoms",
    "would exert forces to their immediate substrate neighbors creating a displacement field equivalent to a strain field .",
    "basic idea of the current model are adatom pairs stretching or compressing their bond due to their position on substrate sites .",
    "those pairs exert forces to their immediate substrate neighbors and thus create a displacement field to balance the forces .",
    "the strain fields of such pairs will mediate interactions between pairs and also between pairs and monomers .",
    "the interaction of a monomer with a pair is a trio interaction , the interaction of two pairs is a quattro interaction .",
    "lattice mismatch - known as source of substrate strain [ 7 ] - is the mesoscopic consequence of such pair interactions .",
    "if forces between pairs are central , the model can be kept simple and the resulting stress fields can ( with symmetry restrictions ) be described with one more free parameter than the previous monomer interaction model .",
    "the requirement of mechanical equilibrium allows to formulate the elastic energy as a sum of pair- , trio- and quattro terms and to solve them separately .",
    "calculations below are based on a plain wave expansion of the displacement field and an eigenvalue method , introduced in [ 8 ] , equivalent to a green function method used in other papers [ 7 ] . closely following [ 3 ] the elastic energy is diagonalized in a set of elastic modes and a generalized eigenvalue problem",
    "is established and solved .",
    "the elastic interaction will show up as a series of special functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : + after outlining the motivation in section 1 the elastic model and its proof are given in section 2 . in section 3",
    "the method for calculating interactions is detailed . in section 4 applicability and limitations of the model are discussed .",
    "section 5 closes with a summary of the results .",
    "in this section the overall energy is introduced and the elastic part is diagonalized in terms of eigenmodes .",
    "a set of linear equations for the equilibrium displacements in the bulk and at the surface is deduced with an eigenvalue @xmath0 to be used later for calculating the elastic interaction of adatoms and dimers .",
    "the tensor ( and tensor product ) notation used below ( bold letters ) tries to concentrate on the essentials , details of the indices are given in [ 3 ] .",
    "the text in the following follows close to [ 3 ] but needs extensions to handle the difference between adatom distributions , responsible for pair interactions , and the distributions of adatom pairs , responsible for trio- and quattro interactions .",
    "the subscripts _ _ _ k , l _ will be used to label different distributions .",
    "the subscript @xmath1 will be used to label eigenmodes .",
    "the adatom surface energy h is assumed to consist of an elastic part @xmath2 and part @xmath3 comprising other interactions    @xmath4    in the following sections the focus will be put on elastic interactions comprising also short range .",
    "adatoms exert forces on their substrate neighbors leading to a displacement of substrate atoms to balance those forces .",
    "such displacements will increase or decrease the energy of the system . in a continuum description adatoms exert stress parallel to the surface leading to substrate strain which in turn can lead to an attraction or a repulsion of neighboring adatoms .",
    "the strength of such strain mediated interaction will depend on the stress adatoms exert on the substrate and on the stiffness of the substrate .",
    "the elastic energy of a substrate with adatoms in a continuous description is given by the sum of two parts , the energy of the distorted substrate and the energy of adatoms exerting tangential forces on the substrate    @xmath5    here = [ @xmath6 denotes the strain tensor , = [ @xmath7 denotes the elastic constants tensor , and = [ @xmath8 denotes the stress tensor .",
    "the integrals comprise the bulk v or the surface s. the strain field is related to the displacement field by    @xmath9    if adatoms do not interact directly with their neighbors , the stress field depends only on the configuration of single adatoms . in case where adatoms do interact with their next neighbors directly",
