    "the most general mssm provides a rather big number of complex phases , most of which originate from the soft breaking terms .",
    "of course , the possible ranges of these phases are restricted by the current measurements of leptonic dipole operators such as @xmath0 @xcite or @xmath1 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "fortunately , theory can provide at least one scenario ( cancellation ) , in which the bounds for the dipole operators are respected without too small values for the phases @xcite,@xcite .",
    "once assumptions about the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking are made , most soft breaking parameters can be computed from their input parameter using the rge s for running them from the unification scale to the scale relevant at colliders , and the bounds on the phases can get rather strong . + nevertheless , since mass - spectra and couplings obviously depend on - besides several real parameters - the phases , they are a priori non - neglible in studies of possible signals at future colliders and should be considered as free parameters of the model .",
    "actually the situation is even worse : neglecting phases during the determination of real parameters from experimental data could lead to wrong inputs for theorists , who want to specify the underlying theory at the unification scale .",
    "+ despite the necessity to extract values for phases from experiment , the construction of sizable and comfortably accessible cp - violating observables is rather difficult in most of the production channels at an @xmath2-machine as at least one secondary decay has to be included . considering this problem we are introducing an object which quantifies the impact of non - vanishing phases on cp - even cross - sections and allows us to investigate this impact to some extent .",
    "the basic idea of this work @xcite is to take today s low energy data ( lower mass - bounds , @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) as a set of constraints for a parameter space scan and then to apply the resulting , low - energy compatible points to a set of high energy experiments @ nlc ( @xmath2 and @xmath3-option ) .",
    "this set of high energy - experiments is given by the total , unpolarized cross - sections for @xmath4- , @xmath5- , @xmath6 pair production and is completed by @xmath7 production @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "+ since we are are dominantly interested in the role of phases , the most stringent bounds on parameter space arise from the possible size of the susy - contributions to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are given by : @xmath8 recalling the diagrammatic structure of the susy - contribution to the leptonic dipol operators ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) and comparing with the several ( tree - level ) diagrams for the given production modes we notice a _ complementarity _ between low- and high - energy observables : both low - energy observables always depend on products of different vertices while each diagram contributing to the cross - sections depends only on bilinears of one supersymmetric vertex ( or a product of a supersymmetric one and a known sm - vertex ) .",
    "this implies that the low - energy observables connect different parts of susy - lagrangians and therefore only can give bounds on combinations of phases , whereas high - energy observables can be used to investigate the different parts separately .",
    "+ as framework for this project we are using the mssm with r - parity , neglect sflavour mixing and assume horizontal universality of the yukawa - like soft breaking @xmath11 terms .",
    "therefore the real parameters relevant for our analysis are : @xmath12 and the investigated phases are ( @xmath13 by convention ) : @xmath14",
    "as pointed out already , our aim is to find an object quantifying the impact of cp - odd phases on cp - even cross - sections and to understand the behaviour and meaning of this object . as underlying assumption for the definition of this object",
    "we assume that real parameters are already fixed .",
    "this assumption is indeed simplifying our analyses significantly , nevertherless we think it is a fair one , as most of the recent analysis do the same _ and _ neglect phases . the basic idea for the object we are introducing as _ significance of a cp - even cross section with respect to cp - phases _",
    "is to compare the deviation of counting rates between a cp - conserving ( cpc : real parameters , all phases @xmath15 ) and cp - violating point ( cpv : same real parameters , _ but _ phases @xmath16 and low - energy compatible ) to the statistical error of the cpc - point . in formulae",
    "this idea reads as : @xmath17 as there are two cp - conserving values ( 0 , @xmath18 ) for each phase , we have to deal with 8 cpc points for each set of real parameters , a priori the same number of ( different ) significances is available for each cross - section and we have to decide which one to use in further discussions .",
    "+ our selection rule is then take the minimum of s with respect to these 8 points , this corresponds to the most conservative estimate of the impact of phases on cross - sections , and @xmath19 finally reads : @xmath20 where the indices @xmath21 , @xmath22 refer a given out - mode with particles @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding cross - sections in a cpv- or cpc - point . +",
    "although it is rather clear that a high value of @xmath24 indicates a significant dependence of the mode on the phases , it is not clear where this dependence originates from .",
    "so the next step is to separate kinematical from coupling effects . for this purpose",
    "we define a variation of masses as : @xmath25 which is calculated in the cpv - point which minimizes @xmath24 . since slepton masses are phase independent we are investigating slepton production with respect to the lightest neutralino in the @xmath26-channel diagrams .",
    "the point about studying this mass - variation is that a small variation of masses correspondes to small variation of the kinematical functions ( @xmath27 ) and a large @xmath24 should therefore be induced by coupling effects .",
    "our complete numerical analysis is currently performed for different values of @xmath28 ( 3,6,9,12 ) and two values for @xmath29 ( 200 gev , 500 gev ) .",
    "the remaining real parameters are fixed as : @xmath30= 200 gev , @xmath31=100 gev , @xmath32=235 gev , @xmath33=180 gev and @xmath34=500 gev @xcite . for each of these 8 real parameter points",
    "we scan the phases @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 randomly in ( 0 , 2@xmath18 ) , after applying the low - energy constraints as cuts the typical survival rate is a few permille ( initially 500,000 points ) .",
    "+ by correlating low - energy compatible values of the phases , we always find rather small bands for @xmath35 ( @xmath38 ) located around 0 , while the bands for @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be rather large or even complete .",
    "the concrete pattern of correlations between them of course depends sensitively on the choice of real parameters .",
    "anyway , these results are no news , so we do nt present any of the low - energy correlations here.@xcite + although the number of correlations between low- and high - observables or between high - energy - observables is large , we can illustrate the basic results using two examples and a set of real parameters . as examples",
    "we show the correlations between @xmath0 and the significance and the correlation between mass - variation and significance for the @xmath39-mode ( left and right , upper panels in fig.[fig1 ] ) and the @xmath40-mode ( left and right , lower panels in fig.[fig1 ] ) in @xmath41-collisions .",
    "+ both modes illustrate that sizable significances are possible over the complete range of @xmath0 , indicating possible big deviations between cpc and cpv - points even for vanishing @xmath0 .",
    "the obvious no - correlation pattern between significances and @xmath0 is rather transparent as the significances are functions of 2 phases while @xmath0 depends on 3 phases .",
    "note that @xmath0 violates chirality and therefore always includes a factor of the electron yukawa coupling , so that contributions proportional to @xmath42 are _ not _ suppressed here .",
    "basically the same argumentation applied to the strong correlation patterns between mass - variations and significances , as masses and cross - sections both depend on the same phases . since the scale of mass - variation is of o(% ) for both modes the significance must originate dominantly from coupling effects .",
    "+    in fig.[fig2 ] we show the correlation between the significances of both modes , again we observe a correlation pattern as both cross - sections depend on the same phases .",
    "the triangle structure of the correlation is clear , as the significance of each mode reaches a maximum for a certain value of @xmath36 ( @xmath35 is a small band and can be considered as fixed ) and the maximizing values for different cross - sections do _ not _ coincide .",
    "after using low - energy data as constraints on parameter space we rediscover older bounds on phases , the allowed range for the phases can be rather big . we can give a quantity ( _ significance _ ) to estimate the impact of cp - odd phases on cp - even cross - sections .",
    "this significance can be rather big , implying a significant deviation of cp - violating scenarios from cp - conserving one already at the level of cross - sections .",
    "these significances are correlated with each other , _ but not _ with @xmath0 and @xmath1 and they are dominantly due to coupling effects . therefore phases should be taken into account in any discussion of how to extract model parameters from measured cross - sections .",
