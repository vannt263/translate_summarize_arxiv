    "let @xmath3 be an abelian surface over the complex numbers , and @xmath4 the sign involution .",
    "the quotient surface @xmath5 is a normal surface with 16 rational double points of type @xmath2 , whose minimal resolution @xmath6 is a k3 surface .",
    "one also says that @xmath6 is a kummer k3 surface ; they play a fairly central role in the theory of all complex k3 surfaces .",
    "it is easy to see that the kummer construction works in positive characteristics @xmath7 as well .",
    "in contrast , shioda @xcite and katsura @xcite observed that the kummer construction breaks down in characteristic @xmath8 for supersingular abelian surfaces @xmath3 . in this case",
    ", they showed that singularities on the quotient surface @xmath9 are elliptic singularities , and that the minimal resolution @xmath6 is a rational surface .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a new type of kummer construction in the supersingular situation at @xmath8 . to explain this construction ,",
    "let me discuss the case where @xmath3 is superspecial , that is , isomorphic to the selfproduct @xmath10 of supersingular elliptic curves .",
    "my idea is to replace the supersingular elliptic curve @xmath11 by a cuspidal rational curve @xmath12 , and the group action of @xmath13 by a suitable group scheme action of the infinitesimal group scheme @xmath14 . in particular , we start with the _ nonnormal _ surface @xmath15 . nevertheless , it turns out that the quotient @xmath16 is a normal surface , whose singularities are rational double points of type @xmath0 , @xmath17 , or @xmath1 , at least if the ground field is perfect .",
    "the first main result of this paper is the following :    the minimal resolution of singularities @xmath18 is a k3 surface .",
    "there are complications for nonperfect ground fields .",
    "it seems that the minimal resolution could be a regular surface with trivial canonical class that is not geometrically regular .",
    "this seems to be an interesting subject matter in its own right , but i do not pursue this topic in the present paper .",
    "the kummer construction also plays an important role in the theory of supersingular k3 surfaces in characteristic @xmath19 . recall that a k3 surface @xmath6 is called _ supersingular _ ( in the sense of shioda ) if its picard number equals the second betti number , that is , @xmath20 .",
    "artin @xcite introduced for such k3 surfaces an integer invariant @xmath21 called the _",
    "artin invariant _ , which can be defined in terms of discriminants of the intersection form .",
    "shioda @xcite proved for @xmath7 that the supersingular k3 surfaces with artin invariant @xmath22 are precisely the kummer k3 surfaces coming from supersingular abelian surfaces .",
    "the second main result of this paper is :    our k3 surfaces @xmath6 are supersingular with artin invariant @xmath23 .",
    "this depends on an analysis of the degenerate fibers in the quasielliptic fibrations @xmath24 induced from the projections on @xmath15 .",
    "drops in the artin invariants are due to confluence of a pair of @xmath0-singularities into a single @xmath1-singularity .",
    "oort @xcite showed that any supersingular abelian surface is an infinitesimal quotient of a superspecial abelian surface .",
    "this implies that supersingular abelian surfaces @xmath3 form a 1-dimensional family , in which the action of @xmath13 is constant . in our new kummer construction",
    ", it is the other way round : the nonnormal surface @xmath15 does not move , but the action of @xmath14 lies in a moving family .",
    "this is reminiscent of the moret - bailly construction @xcite .",
    "our construction gives a family @xmath25 of normal surfaces with rational double points over the punctured affine plane @xmath26 . according to the work of brieskorn @xcite and artin @xcite ,",
    "simultaneous resolutions exist rarely without base change .",
    "this is indeed the case in our situation :    the family of normal surface @xmath25 admits a simultaneous minimal resolution of singularities after certain purely inseparable base change .",
    "we achieve simultaneous resolution by successively blowing up weil divisors in multiple fibers on the quasielliptic fibrations @xmath27 .",
    "the purely inseparable base change enters the picture , because the original family contains integral fibers switching to multiple fibers over the perfect closure .",
    "it turns out that the resulting family of k3 surfaces @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the purely inseparable base change , is induced from a family of @xmath30 surfaces parameterized by the projective line @xmath31 .",
    "this is in accordance with results of rudakov and shafarevich @xcite and ogus @xcite on the moduli of marked supersingular k3 surfaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ generalities ] discusses the interplay between restricted lie algebras and infinitesimal group schemes of height @xmath32 , in particular @xmath33 .",
    "section [ quotients ] contains some results on the behavior of quotients with respect to base change and singularities . in section [ cuspidal ]",
    "we examine the rational cuspidal curve @xmath12 in characteristic two , determine its restricted lie algebra , and read off all possible @xmath14-actions . in section [ selfproduct ]",
    ", we consider the selfproduct @xmath15 , define @xmath14-actions on it , and establish some basic properties .",
    "this is refined in the following two sections , where we determine the structure of singularities on the quotient @xmath16 .",
    "i return to global properties of @xmath34 in section [ quasielliptic ] , where we analyse quasielliptic fibrations . in section [ k3 ]",
    "we turn to the the resolution of singularities @xmath6 , and establish that it is a supersingular k3 surface provided that the parameters do not vanish simultaneously . in section [ discriminants ] , we determine the artin invariant . here",

    "note that ogus works in his paper under the general assumption @xmath897 , which seems appropriate for several arguments involving quadratic forms .",
    "however , the result concerning the existence of @xmath896 holds true in all characteristics .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see that the cofibered groupoid @xmath898 of @xmath895-marked families of k3 surfaces is a stack , and indeed an algebraic stack (= artin stack ) .",
    "the latter involves grothendieck s algebraization theorem and openness of versality in the usual way . according to rudakov and shafarevich @xcite , section 8 , proposition 3 ,",
    "the automorphism group of any marked k3 surface is trivial .",
    "by @xcite , lemma 2.2 this carries over to families of marked k3 surfaces .",
    "it follows that the algebraic stack @xmath898 is equivalent to its coarse moduli space @xmath896 , which is a nonseparated algebraic space .",
    "the upshot is that the algebraic space @xmath896 is a fine moduli space .",
    "our @xmath895-marked flat family @xmath35 induces a morphism @xmath899 . according to proposition [ generic isomorphism ] , this morphism is constant along all pointed lines , that is , fibers of the canonical projection @xmath883 .",
    "the image @xmath900 is therefore a 1-dimensional algebraic space .",
    "any algebraic space is generically a scheme , whence we obtain a rational morphism @xmath901 that extends as a continuous map on the underlying topological spaces .",
    "a local computation then shows that the rational morphism extends to a morphism @xmath902 of algebraic spaces .",
    "pulling back the universal family from @xmath822 to @xmath31 , we obtain the desired family @xmath36 inducing our original family @xmath35 ."
