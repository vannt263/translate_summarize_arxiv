    "the value of the highest planet mass achieved in the presence of gap opening is somewhat controversial .",

    "the linear theory of lindblad resonances for disk - planet interactions demonstrates that the strongest contributing resonances have azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath73 .",
    "this estimate comes from considering the so - called torque cutoff effect that arises from lindblad resonances that lie close to the planet @xcite . as a consequence of the resonance condition",
    ", we expect the peak torque density to be at a distance of roughly @xmath37 from the planet .",
    "the torque cutoff is not sharp and there are torque contributions from resonances that lie closer than distance @xmath74 from the planet , although at a decreasing level as they get closer to the planet .",
    "as we will see , the numerical results show the torque density peak to be close to distance @xmath37 from the planet .",
    "however , the torque cutoff calculations assume that the orbits are such that the gas azimuthally passes by the planet , i.e , lies on circulating orbits . on the other hand , close to the planet s orbit , this assumption breaks down and the gas flows on librating streamlines of the horseshoe orbit region .",
    "this region _ generally _ extends in the radial direction to a distance of about @xmath75 from the planet s orbital radius , where @xmath54 is the planet s hill radius .",
    "but , close to the planet , the region becomes less extended radially , spanning only to approximately @xmath54 . that is , the noncoorbital ( circulating ) streamlines pass closest to the planet at a distance about equal to @xmath54 ( see streamline _ a _ in @xcite and figure  5 in @xcite ) . in the horseshoe orbit region , the corotational resonance can play a role .",
    "these two regions , the coorbital region ( extending up to about @xmath75 from the planet s orbital radius ) and lindblad torque region ( extending beyond about distance @xmath37 from the planet s orbital radius ) , overlap in a one - dimensional radial sense for planet - to - star mass ratios @xmath76 this condition does not necessarily imply a physical overlap in two or three dimensions .",
    "but it does affect our interpretation of the torque density reduced to one dimension , @xmath77 .",
    "the reason is that for a given radius @xmath21 such that @xmath78 , the gas lies in either the coorbital ( librating ) or noncoorbital ( circulating ) region , depending on the azimuth .    for the disk parameters considered in this section ,",
    "the one - dimensional overlap occurs for planet masses greater than about @xmath79 , which covers all , but one , of the planet masses considered . for a @xmath10 planet",
    ", this overlap occurs out to a radius of about @xmath80 or a radial distance of about @xmath81 from planet .",
    "the two regions physically overlap in a two- or three - dimensional sense , when the closest approach of all noncoorbital ( circulating ) streamlines , which occurs at a distance @xmath82 from the planet , is greater than the distance where there are maximum lindblad torques ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "this occurs when @xmath83 in this case , the usual torque cutoff condition for lindblad resonances is questionable .",
    "this argument suggests that the torque density maximum for lindblad resonances should occur at a radial distance from the planet @xmath84 when this condition is satisfied , the overall torque on the planet will be reduced , even if @xmath85 , since resonances that lie closer than distance @xmath37 from the planet are suppressed . for the disk parameters considered in this section ,",
    "this condition is satisfied for @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) .",
    "the flow in the coorbital region is trapped in horseshoe orbits . for a time - reversible system ( e.g. , no dissipation or migration ) ,",
    "the streamlines are exactly periodic and no net torque occurs on the planet due to the disk ( i.e. , the torque saturates ) , except for possible initial transients due to initial conditions .",
    "however , turbulent viscosity introduces irreversibility that can lead to a net torque .",
    "the condition for saturation within the framework of the @xmath88-disk model is that the libration timescale of the fluid in the coorbital region is shorter than the viscous radial diffusion timescale across this region .",
    "based on scaling arguments , the saturation condition is given by @xcite @xmath89 for the parameters in this section , this constraint implies that for planets of order @xmath8 or greater , the corotation torques should be saturated ( small ) .",
    "saturation effects should be important for the larger planet masses we consider .",
    "the torque per unit disk mass is defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the axisymmetric disk density ( i.e. , the surface density averaged over the azimuth @xmath38 ) and notation @xmath68 is defined below equation  ( [ eq : dtdr ] ) .    numerically , the torque distribution per unit disk mass is determined by dividing the ( three - dimensional ) disk into a series of concentric shells , of radius @xmath92 and thickness @xmath93 , centered at the origin and calculating the torque exerted by the shell and the mass of the shell .",
    "the torque per unit disk mass is obtain from the ratio of these two quantities in this procedure due to the difference between the spherical coordinate system used in the calculations and the cylindrical coordinates that apply to the definition of the torque in equation  ( [ eq : dtdr ] ) .",

    "we use the radial grid spacing on the base grid for the value of @xmath93 .",
    "the torques arising from within the hill sphere of the planet are ignored in this section , but are included in later sections of this paper .",
    "we ignore such considerations here in order to compare results with the standard theory of coorbital and lindblad torques , which does not include such contributions @xcite .",
    "the torque per unit disk mass for four planet mass cases is shown in figure  [ fig : dtdm ] .",
    "the plots are normalized such that the torque densities in the four cases would be the same , according to linear theory , if the axisymmetric disk density gradients and gas properties ( sound speeds and viscosities ) were the same .",
    "that is , the torque density per unit disk mass is scaled by the square of the star - to - planet mass ratio . the @xmath7 ( _ solid line _ ) and @xmath8 ( _ long - dashed line _ ) cases nearly exactly overlap as predicted , while the @xmath9 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) and @xmath10 ( _ short - dashed line _ ) cases have a smaller scaled torque density .",
    "the scaling in the plot masks the fact that the results span a large range of parameter space . in going from @xmath7 to @xmath10",
    "there is a change in torque density by a large factor , @xmath94 , while the discrepancy is about a factor of 2.5 .",
    "the deviations in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 cases could be due to the modified torque cutoff , pressure gradients , and nonlinearities . since @xmath95 in these cases ,",
    "lindblad resonance contributions are weakened by the modified torque cutoff , as discussed in section  [ sec : radoverlap ] .",

    "the shift would then cause the torques per unit disk mass to be weaker , as seen in the figure .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the case of stronger pressure gradients , as may occur for deep gaps , and the sign of the effect on the torque depends on the detailed shape of the density profile .",
    "nonlinearities may play a role in the @xmath10 case , since there are shocks in the disk in that case , due to the strong forcing .",
    "but the total torque is not expected to be substantially effected by nonlinearity . for a fixed smooth background disk density distribution ,",
    "resonant torques are quite insensitive to the level of nonlinearity @xcite . for a @xmath10 planet and a resonance with azimuthal wavenumber @xmath96 ,",
    "the nonlinearity is mild with nonlinearity parameter @xmath97 , as defined by @xcite .",
    "some broadening of the torque density profile is predicted , while the total torque is reduced by only about @xmath98% . for much stronger",
    "nonlinearity , @xmath99 , the torque reduction is only @xmath0% .",
    "this estimate is based on considering only a single resonance .",
    "many resonances overlap , increasing the level of nonlinearity .",
    "however , the theory does not describe overlapping resonances .",
    "so , although we can not be definite about the importance of nonlinearities , indications for a single resonance suggest that they are not important .",
    "the torque density per unit disk mass for the @xmath10 planet in figure[fig : dtdm ] ( _ short - dashed line _ ) shows indications of saturation for @xmath100 . as discussed above ,",
    "this effect is suggested by theoretical considerations .",
    "the torque density peak for the @xmath10 case is slightly displaced away from the planet relative to the smaller mass cases and lies close to a distance @xmath101 from the planet .",
    "this result is consistent with equation  ( [ eq : rtm ] ) in the @xmath10 case , @xmath102 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dtdr ] shows that the torque in the @xmath10 case is acquired close to the planet , well within the gap region .",
    "most of the torque is accumulated by material with intermediate / low density interacting with an intermediate magnitude torque per unit disk mass . about @xmath103% of the torque",
    "is due to material within a radial distance of @xmath104 from the planet .",
    "we investigate the orbital migration of a planet that is undergoing run - away gas accretion .",

    "prior to the phase of run - away gas accretion , the rate at which gas is accreted is largely determined by the ability of a planetary core s envelope to radiate away the energy delivered by gas and solids ( phase of slow gas accretion , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "but , the qualitative results ( approximately following the expectations of standard type  i and ii theory ) remain .",
    "we examine this issue further in appendix  [ sec : diskgrav ] .",
    "we have shown that if a low mass protoplanet is allowed to rapidly grow in mass while it migrates , the orbital radius evolution begins at the type  i rate ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : tanakadotai ] and [ eq : tanakadotaisat ] ) and approaches the type  ii migration rate as a clean gap develops . since the evolving planet gains mass at the fastest possible rate , the run - away accretion rate , the time available for gap clearing is relatively short .",
    "such conditions should be favorable for migration dominated by coorbital torques .",
    "but as we saw in figure  [ fig : a_xsn ] , such situations only reveal types  i and ii migration . in this section",
    ", we explore a more extreme situation for providing coorbital material .",
    "we consider the case that a planet of higher initial mass ( higher than the @xmath113 considered thus far ) is suddenly immersed in a smooth disk .",
    "gap clearing is then not initially present for the higher mass planets .",
    "more coorbital gas is available for affecting migration .",
    "we consider a planet with initial mass @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) that is allowed to grow and migrate in a three - dimensional disk with initial density @xmath252 at @xmath248 ( same as the lower initial density disk in fig .",

    "its orbital radius evolution is plotted as a dotted curve with solid circles in figure  [ fig : a_03sr ] , together with the migration track of the model that starts with @xmath260 at @xmath150 ( plotted as a _ solid curve _ ) . for purposes of comparison ,",
    "the initial orbital radius @xmath105 for the dotted curve case is chosen to be the @xmath25 value of the solid curve case when its planet mass is also @xmath9 .",
    "given the large initial mass of the planet for the dotted curve case , the mass growth is very rapid : the planet gains about @xmath261 over the first @xmath262 orbits of evolution .",
    "the figure shows that , with these disk conditions , migration rates differ only for a brief period of time , but they soon converge to values compatible with orbital migration in the more relaxed disk ( compare slopes of _ solid _ and _ dotted lines _ ) .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure show that the planet initially migrates at the type  i rate , it follows that @xmath263 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tanakadotai ] ) . ] .",
    "but it later slows to nearly the same rate as the solid curve case .",
    "again , there is no indication of type  iii migration .",
    "we consider the case of a nongrowing @xmath9 planet by removing gas mass near the planet without adding the mass of this material to the planet s mass .",
    "this situation may mimic the effects of an efficient disk wind .",
    "these models differ from those in mp03 and dbl05 , who considered nonaccreting planets , only with respect to the accretion boundary conditions near the planet and the time of planet release .    unlike the mass removal case",
    ", the nonaccreting case may introduce a complication because of the buildup of gas within the planet s hill sphere , which can become more massive than the planet .",
    "it has been argued that inertia effects from material close to the planet could introduce complications in self - consistently analyzing the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "appendix  [ sec : typeiii_app ] describes some effects of the nonaccreting boundary condition . to avoid this potential problem",
    ", we remove gas near the planet and ignore torques exerted by the gas on the planet within the inner half of the hill sphere ( by radius ) , where most of the bound gas resides ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : boundtracers ] ) .",
    "we are interested in seeing whether these situations could give rise to strong torques outside the hill sphere that can not be accounted for by type  i or type  ii theory in the case of a planet of fixed mass .",
    "as we show below , there are conditions under which such strong torques occur in the coorbital region .",
    "we consider a saturn mass ( @xmath9 ) planet in a disk having @xmath264 .",
    "the initial ( unperturbed ) disk surface density varies as @xmath265 , with @xmath266 , and kinematic viscosity @xmath267 .",
    "most of these calculations are carried out in two dimensions since @xmath268 .",
    "however , we checked that results from three - dimensional models are in general agreement with those from two - dimensional models ( see _ dotted curves _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_fast ] ) .",
    "simulations in three dimensions use the grid system outlined in section  [ sec : growingmigratingplanets ] . as in the three - dimensional case , the two - dimensional grid has a linear base resolution of @xmath269 . in the coorbital region around the planet ,",
    "the linear resolution is @xmath270 . since we intend to study some global properties of flow dynamics in the coorbital region , three grid levels extend @xmath271 in azimuth around the star .",
    "convergence tests at these grid resolutions are presented in appendix  [ sec : typeiii_app ] .    as anticipated above",
    ", here we assume that some process removes gas from the disk , according to the procedure detailed in section  [ sec : gasaccretion ] , but that the planet mass remains constant .",
    "the migration rate of the fixed mass planet is not substantially affected by the assumption that the gas is removed . in appendix",
    "[ sec : typeiii_app ] we show that configurations with a nonaccreting planet result in similar migration tracks .",
    "hence , our conclusions would apply to nonaccreting planets as well .    in mp03 and dbl05 ,",
    "the planet s orbital radius was initially fixed for over @xmath272 orbits , so that a time - steady disk gap would form before it underwent migration .",
    "here we reconsider that configuration , but examine cases where the planet s initial orbital radius is fixed for a shorter time , only @xmath64 orbits .",
    "this case is somewhat like that of section  [ sec : highplanetmass ] which has more gas in the coorbital region ( _ lower curve _ case in fig .",
    "[ fig : a_xsn ] ) , but instead has a fixed mass planet in a cooler disk .",
    "the following factors applied here should help increase the torques from the coorbital region : cooler disk , fixed planet mass , higher disk density , and reduced time on initially fixed orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_fast ] shows that the migration timescale of the planet is quite short and that it lengthens as the release time increases ( and the gap deepens ) .",
    "we focus on the case with @xmath273 ( _ solid line _ case in the figure ) , which has a migration timescale of order @xmath64 initial orbital periods .",
    "although short , this migration timescale is longer than the type  i migration timescale that would be predicted if the planet did not open a gap ( _ lower short - dashed curve _ of pair , it follows that @xmath274 is a constant ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tanakadotai ] ) . ] ) .",
    "the planet does open a partial gap , as seen in figure  [ fig : sig_fast ] . so it might appear that a weakened form of type  i migration , due to partial gap opening , could explain the simulated migration rate .",
    "however , we demonstrate below that the migration can not be explained by the usual type  i theory .",
    "figure  [ fig : dtdm_fast ] shows the torque distribution per unit disk mass exerted on the planet , as defined by equation  ( [ eq : dtdm ] ) .",
    "the torque density distribution at the time of release of the planet , @xmath64 orbits after the start of the simulation , reveals a curve characteristic of type  i torques .",
    "the distribution is similar to the cases plotted in figure  [ fig : dtdm ] , although it is somewhat larger in magnitude , as expected by the lower sound speed of the gas and the two ( rather than three ) dimensions of the simulation .",
    "however , at later times the torque distribution changes character , with much larger values in the coorbital zone , within radial distances of about @xmath275 from the orbit of the planet .",
    "in particular , there is substantial torque occurring in the radial band @xmath276 , where @xmath277 .",
    "we argued in section  [ sec : radoverlap ] that this region involves only coorbital torques ( not lindblad torques ) .",
    "we have verified that this torque is not originating from within the planet s hill sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a_fast_chk ] ) .",
    "the contribution from within the hill sphere is about @xmath3% of the net torque at release time and generally less than about @xmath35% at later times .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig_fast ] shows that the planet is migrating on a shorter timescale than that of gap opening . at release , the planet is fairly symmetrically positioned in the gap .",
    "later , the planet lies much closer to the inner edge of the gap than to the outer edge , and the gap is less deep . such a situation would be expected to lead to slower or even outward migration according to type  i theory of lindblad resonances , since the inner resonances ( which provide outward migration ) are more strongly activated than the outer resonances ( which provide inward migration ) due to the asymmetric density distribution near the planet . if fact , the slowing / stalling of inward migration due to the feedback from the inward disk density of a migrating planet was envisioned by @xcite and @xcite in their consideration of the inertial limit to planet migration . to quantify the effects of standard type  i torques ,",
    "we apply the type  i torque distribution taken at the time of planet release in figure  [ fig : dtdm_fast ] . in doing so",
    ", we are ignoring pressure effects on @xmath278 due to the changing gap shape .",
    "we determine the type  i torques at the later times by integrating this torque distribution ( appropriately shifted to the instantaneous position of the planet ) over the disk mass distributions in figure  [ fig : sig_fast ] .",
    "the torque is then given by @xmath279 where @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "we find that the resulting type  i migration rates at times of @xmath35 and @xmath3 orbits after release are _ outward _ and equal to @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively .",
    "clearly , results from the simulation are not consistent with the expectations of the usual type  i migration theory .",
    "instead , we claim the effects of the corotation resonances are critical for migration here .    in the model by ol06",
    ", fast migration is due to torques caused by a density asymmetry in the coorbital region between gas on the leading and trailing sides of the planet .",
    "the gas on the leading side of the planet is trapped and contains gas acquired at other radii , while the trailing side contains ambient gas near the planet .",
    "the contrast between the trapped and ambient gas is limited by viscous diffusion .",
    "the trapped gas is in a quasi - steady advective - diffusive equilibrium .",
    "the density asymmetry and thus the torque is caused by the motion of the planet .    to test this model",
    ", we analyzed streamlines in the coorbital region in the frame comoving with the planet .",
    "we determine the streamlines in the simulations by following the motion of tracer particles that move with the velocity of the gas ( see appendix  [ sec : boundgas ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : str - nonmig ] we plot coorbital streamlines near before the planet is released , i.e. , while the planet was on a fixed stationary orbit .",
    "the figure shows good agreement between the simulation and theory .",
    "the streamlines are symmetric between the leading ( @xmath284 ) and trailing ( @xmath285 ) sides of the planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : str - mig ] shows the streamlines after the planet is released , while the planet is migrating .",
    "strictly speaking , these are not streamlines in the simulation case but trajectories , since the flow is not in a strict steady state in the comoving frame of the planet because the planet is migrating at a variable rate .",
    "the theoretical streamlines depend on the planet - to - star mass ratio and the migration rate of the planet .",
    "they are calculated assuming a steady state and constant migration rate by means of the linear perturbation model of ol06 .",
    "the theoretical streamlines were calculated by using intermediate parameter values from the simulation during the interval of planet migration : @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the simulated and theoretical streamlines in figure  [ fig : str - mig ] are in approximate agreement .",
    "they show closed streamlines on the leading side of the planet s azimuthal motion .",
    "they contain the trapped gas described above .",
    "the open streamlines on the trailing side of the planet involve ambient gas that streams outward past the planet .",
    "the smaller closed streamlines are centered at about the same azimuth in the two plots , about @xmath288 ahead of the planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig_b_fast ] shows that the gas density asymmetry in the coorbital region between the leading and trailing sides of the planet increases with time .",
    "the unperturbed background density increases with time as the planet encounters higher density gas in its inward migration .",
    "notice that the density increase is higher on the trailing side of the planet than on the leading side .",
    "this result suggests that the trapped gas approximately retains its initial density as the planet migrates .",
    "the gas on the trailing side more fully reflects the local density .",
    "the density asymmetry then gives rise to the dominant torque on the planet .",
    "the ol06 model does not determine the value of coorbital corotational torque for a migrating planet .",
    "it does provide a detailed analysis for the noncoorbital corotational torque . in that case",
    ", the effect of migration is to amplify the standard coorbital torque for a nonmigrating planet @xcite . by analogy",
    ", one might expect similar behavior in the coorbital case .",
    "the standard torque is proportional to the radial derivative of @xmath289 , and hence of the disk vortensity @xmath290 , where @xmath291 is the disk axisymmetric surface density ( azimuthally averaged surface density ) and @xmath292 is the oort constant . in the unperturbed disk model considered here ,",
    "the vortensity is constant , and so the coorbital torque is predicted to be zero .",
    "however , the gap structure in the disk modifies the surface density @xmath291 near the planet ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sig_fast ] ) , thereby providing a vortensity gradient .",
    "the results in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] provide evidence for migration dominated by coorbital torques , or type  iii migration . within the framework of the ol06 model we generalize the results of the simulations and describe some conditions that are favorable for type  iii migration .    as in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] , we consider a planet of fixed mass . for a planet",
    "whose mass is large enough to open a gap , we apply the initial condition that the planet undergoes migration before steady gap formation completes , as was the case in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] .",
    "we require that the planet does not strongly deplete the gas in the coorbital region as it migrates .",
    "this requirement implies that the migration timescale across the coorbital region be shorter than the timescale to clear a gap over that region .",
    "figure  [ fig : sig_fast ] demonstrates that this condition holds for the model in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] .    to derive a crude estimate for this condition",
    ", we assume that the torques exerted by the planet lead to a local change in disk angular momentum over a region whose size is comparable to the coorbital region .",
    "each one - sided torque ( interior and exterior to the orbit of the planet ) on the gas is capable of clearing a gap , while the net effect of both interior and exterior torques results in migration .",
    "the condition that the gap clearing timescale is longer than the migration timescale becomes @xmath293 where @xmath294 is the mass of the coorbital region and @xmath295 is the dimensionless torque asymmetry @xmath296 where @xmath297 and @xmath298 denote the torques interior and exterior to the planet s orbit , respectively .",
    "another condition is that the migration rate be large enough that there a strong asymmetry in streamlines between the leading and trailing sides of the planet , as seen in figure  [ fig : str - mig ] . according to ol06 ,",
    "the asymmetry is strong for migration rates greater than @xmath299 . since the migration begins as type  i migration ( see _ short - dashed line _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : dtdm_fast ] ) , the condition is that @xmath300 .",
    "this condition is approximately @xmath301 notice that the condition is independent of planet mass , since both @xmath274 and @xmath302 are linear in the planet mass .",
    "we now apply these conditions to the model simulated in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] .",
    "the asymmetry parameter is estimated as @xmath303 , from the initial torque distribution in figure  [ fig : dtdm_fast ] .",
    "condition  ( [ eq : cond - gap ] ) is then satisfied for this model , since @xmath304 .",
    "condition  ( [ eq : cond - mig ] ) is also ( marginally ) satisfied , since the initial density is @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",
    "none of the other models discussed in this paper satisfy both conditions .",
    "it also appears that the condition that the planet mass is fixed ( or slowly increasing ) is important .",
    "the dashed curve on the right panel of figure  [ fig : a_fast_chk ] in appendix  [ sec : typeiii_app ] suggests that a planet that grows in mass at the run - away rate would not undergo rapid migration long enough to move very far .",
    "the slow - down is partly due to gap opening that reduces the torques .",
    "the picture is then that a fixed mass planet , initially undergoing sufficiently fast type  i migration , develops strong coorbital torques due to asymmetric trapped gas .",
    "the situation is not simple , however .",
    "we saw in section  [ sec : typeiii_results ] , that the disk s feedback to the planet s motion might slow or halt type  i migration , but the coorbital torques allow the inward migration to continue .",
    "we found that the rate of the resulting migration is actually slower than type  i migration for a smooth disk .",
    "so the conditions  ( [ eq : cond - gap ] ) and ( [ eq : cond - mig ] ) are suggestive only at this point and require further testing .",
    "we have analyzed the evolution of migrating planets that undergo run - away gas accretion by means of multi - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "the results agree with the predictions of type  i and type  ii migration ( see figures  [ fig : a_sn ] through [ fig : a_sn_nu ] ) for a planet of time - varying mass that we obtain from simulations .",
    "the set of simulations include cases with disk densities as low as the minimum mass solar nebula value and as high as @xmath0 times that value , viscosities @xmath307 and @xmath35 times that value ( also @xmath308 times that value , @xmath309 , in a test reported in appendix  [ sec : mvv ] ) , disk temperatures corresponding to @xmath310 and a colder case of @xmath220 .",
    "the mass accretion rates onto the planet ( see figures  [ fig : mp_sig ] and [ fig : mp_hnu ] ) are in general agreement with previous determinations based on fixed mass planets on fixed circular orbits , when comparing cases with the same planet mass and disk properties for which the growth timescale is longer than the gap opening timescale .",
    "planet mass growth rates can be understood in terms of accretion within the bondi radius at lower planet masses , accretion within the hill radius at intermediate masses , and accretion through the gap at higher planet mass ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : taug_sn_fr ] ) .",
    "mass growth rates typically peak at the intermediate planet masses , a few tenths of a jupiter mass .",
    "an important diagnostic for the nature of the disk - planet torques is the scaled torque density distribution per unit disk mass as a function of the scaled radial distance from the planet . in the linear regime of the standard theory of disk - planet resonances , for a fixed form of the disk density distribution @xmath311 and gas properties ( sound speed and viscosity )",
    ", this scaled torque distribution should be universal , independent of planet mass and disk density value .",
    "we verified this universality for low mass planets , although the distribution varies somewhat with planet mass for larger mass planets that open gaps ( compare low mass cases in figures  [ fig : dtdm ] , [ fig : dtdm_sn_mig ] , and [ fig : dtdm_xsn_mig ] ) .",
    "there is no fundamental distinction between the torques involved in type  i and type  ii migration .",
    "this follows from the near independence of the scaled torque density distribution with planet mass .",
    "previous concepts of type  ii suggested that a planet in a clean gap would migrate inward like a test particle that follows the disk accretion .",
    "here we describe a view for cases where the gap is not completely clear of material .",
    "the difference in type  i and type  ii rates is due to the mass density distribution of the gas that multiplies torque density in determining the torque on the planet . in type  ii migration ,",
    "the density distribution adjusts so that the net torque on the planet causes it to migrate at approximately the viscous evolution rate of the disk .",
    "the transition between the two forms of migration is quite smooth . to illustrate this point , we plot in figure  [ fig : a_snc ] the orbital evolution of the planet through the phase where gap formation sets in .",
    "the figure shows that the migration rate can be accounted for by standard type  i theory , corrected for the gas depletion in the gap region , although there is no unique prescription to do this . in the figure , the theoretical curves ( _ dashed lines",
    "are determined by type  i migration theory , equations  ( [ eq : tanakadotai ] ) and ( [ eq : tanakadotaisat ] ) , with the density @xmath312 taken to be the average value in a radial band of half - width @xmath313 ( a typical gap width ) centered on the planet .    for a given planet mass",
    ", the torque density diagnostic reveals that the distribution is not strongly affected by migration or accretion ( figure  [ fig : dtdm ] is quite similar to figures  [ fig : dtdm_sn_mig ] and [ fig : dtdm_xsn_mig ] for similar planet masses ) . in particular",
    ", there is no evidence for strong coorbital torques .",
    "however , in a certain case , we do find evidence for strong coorbital torques , or type  iii migration .",
    "this case has a planet of fixed mass , @xmath314 , that is immersed into a cold , smooth disk .",
    "the planet is held at a fixed orbit for relatively short time ( @xmath65 orbits ) before being released , so that gap clearing is incomplete .",
    "the torque distribution at the time the planet is released follows the expectations of the standard theory for nonmigrating planets .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the curve for the @xmath9 case in figure  [ fig : dtdm ] ( _ dot - dashed curve _ ) with the short - dashed curve ( time @xmath315 ) in figure  [ fig : dtdm_fast ] .",
    "( there are differences in the magnitude of the distributions because of differences in gas sound speeds and dimensionalities of the calculations , but the forms of the distributions are similar ) . at later times , figure  [ fig : dtdm_fast ] reveals a transition to a completely different torque distribution , where coorbital torques play a critical role .    the strong coorbital torque can be understood in terms of an asymmetry in the streamlines between the leading and trailing sides of the planet , in accord with the analytic model of ol06 ( see figures  [ fig : str - nonmig ] and [ fig : str - mig ] ) and also along the lines of @xcite .",
    "this asymmetry causes trapped material to persist on the leading side of the planet which has a different density from the ambient gas that flows on the trailing side ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sig_b_fast ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry gives rise to the coorbital torque .",
    "we suggest some criteria for this form of migration ( see section  [ sec : typeiii_conditions ] ) . more exploration is needed to test them .",
    "although we find evidence for type  iii migration , the conditions required appear somewhat artificial , i.e. , incomplete gap clearing ( nonequilibrium gap ) of a cool disk with a planet of fixed mass .",
    "it is not clear whether and/or how conditions for type  iii could arise in a more plausible evolution scenario .",
    "we have generally assumed that the planet is able to accrete almost all gas the disk is able to provide ( so - called run - away gas accretion ) . for a disk viscosity @xmath316 ,",
    "the mass accretion rates are large .",
    "the time to build a @xmath10 planet starting with a @xmath113 planet in a minimum mass solar nebula is shorter than @xmath317 years , substantially less than the observationally determined disk lifetimes of @xmath318 years @xcite . over this @xmath94 year time interval , the planet has radially migrated inward by only @xmath319% of its initial radius . in other words , for these models , the mass doubling timescale for a @xmath320 planet is short compared to the migration timescale and the disk lifetime .",
    "this situation stands in strong contrast to the earlier phases of planet formation where the migration timescales are shorter than the planet mass doubling timescales and disk lifetimes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

[ fig : mp_sig ] ) , the kinematic turbulent viscosity we typically adopt , @xmath323 , was chosen so that the accretion rate evaluates to about this same value , @xmath321 per year . in the case of a planet embedded in a disk , if there is a comparable accretion rate onto a planet of mass @xmath324 ( as found by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the mass doubling timescale for a jupiter - mass planet is about @xmath94 years , consistent with what we found in the simulations in this paper .",
    "but then it is not at all clear why planets would not almost always achieve masses higher than @xmath4 , in contradiction with the observed mass distribution of extra - solar planets and the case of saturn .",
    "special timing for disk dispersal could be invoked , but may be artificial .",

    "a colder disk ( @xmath325 ) would experience stronger tidal truncation effects from a jupiter - mass planet , as @xmath37 becomes significantly smaller than @xmath101 .",
    "this effect could certainly reduce the accretion rate by a large enough factor ( say @xmath35 ) , so that the mass doubling timescale for a @xmath326 planet would become of order @xmath327 years , consistent with the suggestion by @xcite .",
    "the issue then is how cold the disk would need to be .",
    "the model in this paper with @xmath328 ( fig .  [ fig : mp_hnu ] , _ long - dashed line _ ) has the same unperturbed overall disk accretion rate as the @xmath329 case ( figures  [ fig : mp_sig ] and [ fig : mp_hnu ] , _ solid line _ ) , since @xmath23 and the initial surface density @xmath291 are the same .",

    "this effect may set the upper limit to planet masses .",
    "another possibility is that there is a feedback effect that limits the gas accretion rate .",
    "perhaps the heating of the protoplanet envelope by impacting solids continues to later times than is assumed in the standard core accretion model .",

    ". for comparison purposes , also plotted in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid2 ] , as a dotted line with solid circles , are results shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : a_sn_nu ] ( _ dotted line with solid circles _ ) and obtained with the model discussed towards the end of section  [ sec : orbitalradiusevolution ] , which has a different disk density profile inside the planet s orbit and a different radial coverage of the disk .",
    "despite these differences , the two models produce consistent and very similar migration tracks , indicating that disk regions at radii much smaller and much larger than the planet s orbital radius are not playing a determinant role .",
    "the thick curve in the right panel of figure  [ fig : bid2 ] plots the cumulative torque ( in units of @xmath388 ) , i.e. , the torque per unit radius @xmath389 integrated outward over radius , at @xmath390 orbits . as also noted for the @xmath10 case in figure  [ fig : dtdr ] , almost all the torque is due to material within a radial distance of @xmath391 from the orbit of the planet .",
    "figure  [ fig : bid2 ] ( _ left panel _ ) indicates that the migration rate decreases over the course of the simulation .",
    "we find that this is not caused by a changing character of the torque per unit disk mass , @xmath278 , but rather by a changing ( azimuthally averaged ) surface density profile around @xmath392 .",
    "we calculate @xmath278 at release time and the averaged surface density @xmath216 orbits after release .",
    "we then use equation  ( [ eq : dtdr_i ] ) to obtain the _ expected _ cumulative torque , at time @xmath390 orbits , under the assumption that the intrinsic character of @xmath278 remains unchanged over time .",
    "this is plotted as a thin curve in the right panel of figure  [ fig : bid2 ] , along with the _ actual _ cumulative torque ( _ thick curve _ ) .",
    "the difference between the two curves is less than @xmath35% .",
    "we wish to examine here whether the migration trend observed in raising the viscosity from @xmath323 to @xmath361 persists at larger viscosity .",
    "as shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid1 ] ( _ solid line _ ) , when @xmath364 a jupiter - mass planet is able to open only a shallow gap along its orbit ( there is a drop in density of about a factor @xmath119 relative to the value just outside the gap ) .",
    "this is because gap opening conditions are not satisfied ( see section  [ sec : orbitalradiusevolution ] ) . at larger disk viscosity",
    "we therefore expect an even shallower gap .",
    "we perform two three - dimensional simulations with the same setup as that outlined above but with @xmath365 ( @xmath241 at @xmath240 ) and outer radial boundaries at @xmath373 and @xmath393 , respectively .",
    "the linear base resolution is @xmath394 while the resolution in the coorbital region around the planet is @xmath395 .",
    "the viscous diffusion timescale , @xmath368 , at @xmath240 is approximately @xmath396 ( initial ) orbital periods whereas @xmath368 at @xmath373 is over @xmath397 orbits ( and @xmath398 orbits at @xmath399 ) .",
    "we also consider a two - dimensional version of such models , having the same grid structure and resolution in the @xmath21-@xmath38 plane , and outer grid boundary located at @xmath400 ( nearly @xmath401 from the central star ) .",
    "the planet mass grows , at a prescribed rate , from @xmath402 to @xmath10 over about @xmath377 periods ( which is similar to @xmath368 at the planet position ) , while the planet s orbit is held fixed .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid3 ] shows the initial surface density ( _ thin solid line _ ) and the azimuthally averaged density profile when @xmath180 for the three - dimensional model with @xmath373 ( _ thick solid line _ ) and the two - dimensional model ( _ dotted line with solid circles _ ) . as reference ,",
    "the azimuthally averaged density for the case with viscosity @xmath364 and @xmath180 is also plotted as a dashed line ( same as the _ thick solid curve _ in the _ left panel _ of fig .  [",
    "fig : bid2 ] ) . in the overlapping disk region ,",
    "two- and three - dimensional calculations give consistent results .",
    "no significant deviations from the initial density distribution are observed at @xmath403 .",
    "the viscosity condition for gap opening requires that @xmath404 ( see section  [ sec : orbitalradiusevolution ] ) , or @xmath405 , in order for gravitational torques to overcome viscous torques .",
    "in fact , the density distribution in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid3 ] ( _ thick solid line _ and _ dotted line with solid circles _ ) shows a form of rather shallow gap . hence , type  ii migration should not be expected .",
    "the planet is released from its fixed orbit at time @xmath383 ( @xmath180 for @xmath406 ) and the orbit is integrated for @xmath407 viscous timescales at @xmath240 .",
    "figure  [ fig : bid3 ] , ( _ right panel _ ) displays the orbital radius evolution for the two - dimensional ( _ dotted line with solid circles _ ) and three - dimensional ( _ thick solid line _ ) simulations .",
    "the two migration tracks in the main panel closely follow one other .",
    "a comparison between the results obtained from the three - dimensional models , over @xmath408 at the initial orbital radius of the planet , is shown in the inset .",
    "again , there is no indication that disk s evolution at @xmath403 has a significant influence on planet s migration .",
    "as for the case discussed above , nearly all the torque is accumulated by material within a radial band @xmath409 centered on the planet s orbit .",
    "the rate of migration after release time is approximately @xmath410 , which is similar to that of the solid curve in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid2 ] .",
    "this near equality is expected for type  i migration , since it is independent of the level of disk viscosity .",
    "we use the torque per unit disk mass , @xmath278 , at @xmath315 from the model with @xmath364 discussed above in appendix  [ sec : nu1e-4 ] and the averaged surface density profile in the left panel of figure  [ fig : bid3 ] ( _ thick solid line _ ) . by applying equation  ( [ eq : dtdr_i ] )",
    ", we estimate the total torque expected under the assumption that @xmath278 has similar shapes in the two models .",
    "there will be some dependence of @xmath411 on viscosity , since viscosity affects the resonance widths .",
    "this estimate yields a migration rate that agrees within a factor of @xmath412 with the value stated above , indicating that the intrinsic character of the torque per unit disk mass is roughly similar in these two cases .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : highdiskmass ] , there is a possible artificial torque that can act on a planet surrounded by a massive disk , when the planet responds to the gravity of the disk but the disk self - gravity is not included @xcite .",
    "this torque is a consequence of the disk s axisymmetric gravitational force in changing the planet s orbital rotation rate , but not changing the disk s rotation rate ( since the disk is not self - gravitating ) .",
    "this artificial difference leads to a shift in disk resonances that in turn leads to an artificial increase in the planet s inward migration .",
    "it can largely be remedied by forcing the planet to rotate at the local keplerian rate , i.e. , at the same speed as the gas rotates apart from effects of gas pressure . in this prescription",
    ", the planet responds to the nonaxisymmetric forces of the disk that result in migration , while undergoing orbital motion at the keplerian rate .",
    "this scheme is in reasonable accord with simulations that include the full effects of disk self - gravity @xcite .",
    "the full effects of self - gravity cause a slightly faster migration rate than this approximation suggests . we have carried out three - dimensional simulations with such imposed keplerian planetary orbits for various disk mass cases discussed in sections  [ sec : growingmigratingplanets ] and [ sec : typeiii ] . for mass distributions and disk thicknesses , as those applied in section  [ sec : growingmigratingplanets ] , migration tracks show negligible differences , over the entire planet mass range .",
    "the only cases that produce changes beyond a few percent in migration rates are those in section  [ sec : typeiii ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : a_xsnk ] we plot the resulting migration for the same disk models as in figure  [ fig : a_xsn ] .",
    "the migration rates are slower , as found by @xcite .",
    "but , they are still in approximate agreement with the predictions of migration theory .",
    "simulations of the orbital evolution of a fixed saturn - mass planet ( @xmath257 ) in a cold ( @xmath264 ) and massive disk ( @xmath413 at the planet s initial orbital radius ) can lead to a buildup of gas within the planet s hill sphere , which is eventually halted when a sufficiently large pressure gradient is established .",
    "the mass of material that accumulates around the planet can exceed the planet s mass , with possible effects on migration rates . in order to prevent the accumulation of gas within the hill sphere , in the models presented in section  [ sec : nongrowingplanets ] , we applied accreting boundary conditions near the planet , without adding the gas mass to the planet mass . in this appendix",
    "we wish to reconsider the nonaccreting configuration ( as in mp03 and dbl05 ) .",
    "the nonaccreting approach may be considered to be crudely simulating a case where some process prevents the planet from gaining further mass .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig : a_fast_chk ] ,",
    "migration tracks from a two - dimensional model with an accreting planet ( _ solid curves _ ) are compared to those obtained from a two - dimensional model with a nonaccreting planet ( _ dotted curves _ ) .",
    "the gas masses within the hill spheres are drastically different : @xmath414 and @xmath415 in the accreting and nonaccreting planet cases , respectively . in the nonaccreting case , the mass of the gas ( @xmath416 ) within the bound region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : boundtracers ] , _ right panel _ ) should be added to the inertial mass of the planet , thereby slowing migration @xcite .",
    "this effect is indeed seen at early times ( less than @xmath35 orbits after release ) . the migration of the nonaccreting planet with bound gas ( _ dotted curve _ )",
    "is slowed by about a factor of @xmath254 relative to the accreting case ( _ solid curve _ ) . at later times , the migration rates are closer , although it is not clear why .",
    "the reason may be related to our determination that the mass of `` bound '' gas decreases at later times in the nonaccreting case ( see also right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : boundtracers ] ) .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : a_fast_chk ] also plots the orbital evolution when torques from within the hill sphere are not taken into account ( _ solid and dotted curves with solid circles _ ) .",
    "the similarity of these migration tracks to the other plotted in the figure indicates that torques from gas in this region do not dominate the migration rates in this particular case .    in the nonaccreting case , dense gas that accumulates around the planet",
    "could be thought of as forming an envelope , once it becomes bound to the planet . a massive envelope",
    "would then participate in both the gravitational and inertial mass of the planet .",
    "we set up a three - dimensional model , with the same disk properties mentioned above ( see section  [ sec : simulationssetup ] for details ) , and planet mass @xmath417 , where @xmath418 is a `` core '' mass and @xmath419 is the mass of the gas within @xmath356 of the planet . given the large initial mass in the coorbital region ( @xmath420 ) , the planet rapidly gains mass , growing beyond @xmath10 in less than @xmath421 initial orbits .",
    "the planet is released in a smooth disk after a few orbits .",
    "the orbital radius evolution is shown as a dashed line in the right panel of figure  [ fig : a_fast_chk ] , together with those from three - dimensional models with a fixed mass planet and accreting ( _ solid line _ ) and nonaccreting ( _ dotted line _ ) boundary conditions near the planet .",
    "the initial migration rates are similar in all three configurations but migration starts to rapidly slow down when the planet mass , in dashed - line case , grows beyond @xmath422 .",
    "this behavior resembles that seen in figure  [ fig : a_03sr ] ( _ dotted line with solid circles _ ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : a_fast_res ] displays numerical convergence tests for the accreting ( _ left _ ) and nonaccreting ( _ right _ ) planet models presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : a_fast_chk ] .",
    "the two simulations in the left panel have coarsest ( linear ) resolutions in the coorbital region that differ by a factor of @xmath423 , in both radial and azimuthal directions .",
    "calculations in the right panel have resolutions in the coorbital region around the planet that differ by a factor of @xmath254 in each direction .      in the calculations with an accreting planet ,",
    "torque contributions from within @xmath111 of the planet are ignored . by following fluid paths , here we show that most of this material is captured and eventually accreted by the planet .    in a nonstationary flow , streamlines can be used as a proxy for fluid trajectories only over short distances and periods of time .",
    "therefore , we track trajectories of fluid parcels by deploying tracer ( massless ) particles in the flow and then following their motion .",
    "this procedure allows us to obtain a reliable determination of fluid paths regardless of whether the flow is close or far from steady state .",
    "the equations of motion of each particle are integrated every hydro - dynamical time - step by interpolating the velocity field at the particle s location and by advancing its position in time via a second - order runge - kutta method .",
    "both spatial and temporal interpolations are performed by using the velocity field with the highest resolution available , i.e. , that belonging to the most refined grid level in which the particle resides .",
    "the spatial interpolation is based on a monotonized harmonic mean @xcite , which is second - order accurate and capable of handling discontinuities and shock conditions .",
    "hence , trajectories are formally second - order accurate in both space and time .    here",
    "we employ tracer particles to estimate the size to the region occupied by gas bound to nonmigrating planets .",
    "tracers are deployed in the disk within about @xmath424 of a saturn - mass planet ( = @xmath9 ) .",
    "we use both models with and without accreting boundary conditions near the planet discussed in this appendix ( fig.[fig : a_fast_chk ] , _ left panel _ ) and in section  [ sec : nongrowingplanets ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : boundtracers ] shows the distance from the planet , @xmath53 , of particles as a function of time .",
    "tracers are deployed at a time @xmath425 , when the mass within the hill sphere has reached a nearly steady value .",
    "the distance along the trajectories is normalized to the hill radius , @xmath54 .",
