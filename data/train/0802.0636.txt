    "dynamics of saturable absorbers is often well reproduced by using a two - level model with a coherence relaxation - time very short compared to the population relaxation - time .",
    "the propagation of laser pulses in the medium is then simply described by two equations coupling the light intensity and the difference of populations . as far back as 1965",
    ", gires and combaud @xcite used this model to analyze the transmission of laser pulses through dye solutions .",
    "they considered pulses of duration long compared to the population relaxation time , but this approximation is relaxed in subsequent works @xcite .",
    "calculations made by selden in this more general case enabled him to explain not only the narrowing of the transmitted pulse but also its skewing and the time - delay of its maximum @xcite .",
    "selden also studied the transmission of a laser beam when its intensity is slightly modulated by a low frequency sine - wave @xcite .",
    "he showed that the effect of the saturable absorber is to increase the modulation depth and to introduce a phase delay of this modulation .",
    "the experimental data obtained by hillman _",
    "et al_. on ruby @xcite are in full agreement with his predictions on the modulation depth .",
    "although often overlooked , the above mentioned theories @xcite are applicable to most of the recent experiments achieved on various saturable absorbers , including doped crystals @xcite , biological film and solution @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and doped optical fibers @xcite .",
    "developed to attain pulse velocities as slow as possible , these experiments are currently analyzed in terms of coherent population oscillations ( cpo ) , homogeneous hole - burning @xcite and group velocity . as extensively discussed in @xcite , such an analysis is questionable . in most cases",
    "@xcite , the population oscillations are not created in the medium under the combined action of two _ independent coherent _ beams @xcite but results from the _ intensity _ modulation of a single incident beam .",
    "the phenomenon is thus insensitive to phase and frequency fluctuations of the optical field .",
    "the group velocity , attached to a given optical frequency and obtained by expressing that the phase of the field is stationary near this frequency , looses then its relevance .",
    "we also remark that the identification of the group velocity to the ratio of the medium thickness over the time - delay of the pulse maximum , often made in the literature , is incorrect . as a matter of fact",
    ", the saturable absorption and the cpo approaches are based on the same approximations , namely that the coherence relaxation time is infinitely short compared to the population relaxation time , the rabi period and the inverse of the deviations of the laser frequency from the line frequency . in the cpo approach , analytical results have only been obtained in the particular case of a weak sine - wave modulation .",
    "the fact that the saturable absorption approach then gives exactly the same results @xcite shows that the two approaches are equivalent .",
    "however the saturable absorption approach is more straightforward ( it avoids the passage through the refractive index ) and , as shown in the following , is more efficient since it provides analytical results in much more general situations , in particular not only when the pulse acts as a probe but also when its interaction with the medium is fully nonlinear . finally the saturable absorption approach better corresponds to the experimental conditions where the inverse of the pulse duration is generally much smaller than the fluctuations of the optical carrier frequency .",
    "for the first time to our knowledge , we provide in the present paper explicit analytical expressions of the transmitted pulse with a special attention paid to its delay with respect to the incident pulse and to the optimization of this delay . in section [ sec :",
    "section2 ] , we recall the general equations describing the propagation of intensity - modulated light in a saturable absorber . the case of pulses superimposed to a continuous background with a small modulation index is examined in section [ sec : section3 ] .",
    "the nonlinear propagation of pulses in the absence of background and the general case ( pulses and background of arbitrary intensity ) are respectively studied in sections [ sec : section4 ] and [ sec : section5 ] .",
    "we finally compare in section [ sec : section6 ] the fractional delays attainable with saturable absorbers to those which have been actually demonstrated .",
    "we consider a resonant light beam propagating in the _ z_-direction through a saturable absorber modeled as a two level system .",
    "as indicated before , we assume that the coherence relaxation time is infinitely short compared to the population relaxation time , the rabi period and the inverse of the deviations of the laser frequency from the line frequency .",
    "it is then possible to adiabatically eliminate the polarization in the bloch - maxwell equations in order to obtain the two coupled equations @xcite :",
    "@xmath0    @xmath1    in these expressions , @xmath2 is the population relaxation time , @xmath3 is the population difference normalized to its value at equilibrium , @xmath4 is the time retarded by the propagation time in the host medium ( negligible compared to the delays considered in the following ) , @xmath5 is the beam intensity normalized to the saturation intensity @xcite and @xmath6 is the absorption coefficient in the linear regime . combining eq.[eq:1 ] and eq.[eq:2 ] we easily get the nonlinear wave equation : @xmath7 and the transmission equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the absorber thickness and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) is the normalized intensity of the output ( input ) wave . when the input intensity is constant or very slowly varying at the scale of @xmath2 , eq.[eq:4 ] is reduced to the well - known saturation equation @xcite : @xmath12 although established with a two level model , this equation fits very well the transmission curve of multilevel saturable absorbers .",
    "this result is illustrated fig.[fig1 ] where we compare the predicted transmission to that actually measured on a erbium - doped optical fiber @xcite .",
    "of a erbium - doped optical fiber as a function of the incident power . the parameters are @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",

    "a sine - wave does not contain any information and , e.g. , the previous delay @xmath44 may also be seen as an advance @xmath46 .",

    "ultraslow velocities @xmath47 can be achieved by using dense media with long relaxation times @xcite . however , in view of potential applications , the important issue is not merely to achieve ultraslow light but to produce delays as large as possible compared to the duration of _ both the input and the output pulses_. in the following we will thus characterize the slow light systems by their _ figure of merit _ or generalized fractional delay    @xmath48    where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the full width at half maximum of the input ( output ) pulse .",
    "our definition is identical to the usual one ( @xmath51 ) when @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",

    "the saturation power is low ( @xmath206 ) and normalized intensities @xmath26 and/or @xmath140 of @xmath155 can be easily achieved . a fractional delay of about @xmath207 ( fig.[fig3]c )",
    "would then be attained with an input pulse of duration @xmath208 and a linear optical thickness @xmath209 .",
    "the latter would be obtained in a fiber of reasonable length ( @xmath210 ) with an ion density @xmath211 @xcite for which the saturation model is valid .",
    "note that larger fractional delays ( up to @xmath212 with our definition ) have been demonstrated in undoped fibers by exploiting brillouin scattering @xcite but this result is obtained with much longer fibers .",
    "we finally remark that the pulse - delay mechanisms in a saturable absorber strongly differ from those involved in the pure slow - light experiments @xcite .",
    "the former are nonlinear and non coherent whereas the latter are linear and coherent .",
    "moreover the propagation phenomena are essential in the second case whereas they are absent in the first one .",
    "this point is illustrated by our calculations made for an input pulse of strictly finite duration ( sec .",

    "we have shown that the output pulse then stops at the same time that the input one .",
    "on the contrary the propagation effects are responsible of an important delay in the linear case .",
    "this explains in particular the very large fractional delays attained in media with an electromagnetically induced @xcite or a natural @xcite transparency window .",
