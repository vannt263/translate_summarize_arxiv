    "feshbach resonance ( fr ) is a powerful toolbox in the field of ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "it occurs when the energy of two scattering atoms becomes quasi - degenerate with their molecular state in a different spin configuration .",
    "experimentally , one can tune two atoms into a fr by changing magnetic field taking advantage of the differential magnetic dipole moment between the atomic state and the molecular state .",
    "magnetically - induced frs have found tremendous applications .",
    "they have been used , for instance , to control scattering and loss properties of cold atomic gases  @xcite , to study universal few - body physics such as efimov states  @xcite , to create feshbach or ro - vibrational ground state molecules  @xcite , and to study bec - bcs crossover and fermi gases in the unitarity limit  @xcite .    many of the aforementioned applications make use of  broad \" @xmath7-wave frs whose properties",
    "are dominated by the entrance ( open ) channel .",
    "these resonances acquire the universal behavior demonstrated by a single - channel resonance and therefore are useful for studying universal properties in few - body and many - body atomic systems .",
    "there exist a number of  broad \" @xmath7-wave frs in ultracold alkali - metal systems , for both intraspecies  @xcite and interspecies  @xcite mixtures .",
    "however , it is not clear if  broad \" frs also exist for higher partial waves .",
    "this is because the criterion for distinguishing  broad \" and  narrow \" non-@xmath7-wave frs was not established firmly until the multichannel quantum - defect theory ( mqdt ) is extended to neutral atom with van der waals interaction  @xcite .",
    "this theory enables a uniform approach to treat frs in higher partial waves as in the @xmath7-wave , it can therefore provide a rigorous definition of  broad \" frs for all partial waves  @xcite .",
    "the first application of this model to the mixture of @xmath8li and @xmath9k  @xcite found all resonances , both @xmath7-wave and higher partial waves , to be closed - channel dominated and therefore are all  narrow \" resonances .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the semi - analytic mqdt  @xcite to predict and characterize frs in different spin and partial - wave channels of the @xmath0rb-@xmath1rb mixtures .",
    "we find that this mixture exhibits a rich spectrum of  broad \" @xmath7-wave and @xmath6-wave frs .",
    "the predicted frs are observed and verified experimentally .",
    "in particular , a very broad entrance - channel dominated @xmath6-wave resonance we discovered in the lowest energy channel of the system suggests exciting opportunities for investigating universal few - body and many - body behaviors with strong coupling in nonzero partial waves  @xcite , including @xmath6-wave bosonic superfluid mixture , three - body recombination decay , and formation of @xmath6-wave heteronuclear molecules .",
    "besides theoretical curiosity , a main motivation for distinguishing whether a fr is intrinsically  broad \" or ",
    "narrow \" is to determine its usefulness for studying universal properties of strongly interacting few - body and many - body atomic systems at low temperatures . for cold neutral atoms in the ground states ,",
    "such universal properties arise from the common long - range @xmath10 type ( @xmath11 being the interatomic separation ) attractive van der waals potential between the atoms , and the fact that the low - temperature near - threshold scattering wave functions of these systems are predominantly shaped by the long - range potentials  @xcite . since collision of real atoms is intrinsically a multichannel process , systems near a fr ( which provides the required strong interactions ) might or might not exhibit universal behaviors expected for single - channel collisions .",
    "this explains the interest in identifying ",
    "broad \" frs .",
    "a  broad \" fr is technically defined as one that shows universal characteristics of a single - channel collision over a large fraction of its resonance width , where the overall wave function of the colliding atoms is dominated by that from the entrance channel over that from the quasi - degenerate closed channel .",
    "a nice and detailed discussion about the characteristics of  broad \" @xmath7-wave frs can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we extend the discussion to include higher partial waves from the perspective of the semi - analytic mqdt .    considering two - atom scattering with only one channel ,",
    "the physics of the system near the threshold energy is almost independent of the details of the short - range interactions .",
    "it can be fully determined by the long - range potential and a quantum - defect parameter which takes in the effect of the short - range interactions .",
    "this quantum defect depends weakly on the energy and the partial wave quantum number @xmath12 of the system under study . for the quantum - defect theory ( qdt ) based on the analytic solutions to the schrdinger equation with a @xmath10 potential  @xcite",
    ", the near - threshold physics of the system can be studied most efficiently by replacing the real molecular potential by a pure @xmath13 potential which is cut off by a sharp infinite repulsive wall at @xmath14 at a sufficiently small @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ broadornarrow ] for illustration ) . here",
    ", the @xmath15 term represents the centrifugal barrier of the @xmath12-th partial wave and @xmath16 is the actual van der waals interaction coefficient for the system .",
    "the infinite wall sets the boundary conditions and defines the relative phase between the incoming and outgoing wave functions at small @xmath11 , effectively replacing the short - range potential . in qdt",
    ", its effect is represented by the short - range @xmath17 matrix ( @xmath18 ) or its equivalent - the quantum defect @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "for a real atomic system with many scattering channels , if the collision energy lies between the ground channel and the threshold for the first higher energy channel , the scattering problem can be reduced to a single - channel using an effective short - range @xmath20 matrix which takes into account the influence of all channels  @xcite . in this scenario ( mqdt ) , the equivalent parameter @xmath21 becomes more dependent on the energy @xmath22 ( fig .",

    "[ pdoublet ] , provide motivation for better theories of atomic interactions .",
    "the differences between theoretical and experimental resonance positions are due to the energy and the partial wave dependences of the short range qdt parameters that are not included in the present calculation .",
