    "the t hooft s idea @xcite that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) simplifies in the limit of large number of colors , @xmath5 , had proven to be a valuable tool for exploring strong interaction@xcite . with the @xmath6 expansion of qcd",
    ", the qualitative explanations can be given for , for instance , the okubo - zweig - iizuka rule , the regge phenomenology , the soliton picture of baryon@xcite , the contracted @xmath7 spin - flavor symmetry@xcite of qcd , and the spin - flavor structure of many baryon propertiesluty , carone , dashenjenkinsm , pirjolyan , schat .",
    "the existences of the smooth limit of qcd at @xmath8 , with @xmath9 fixed(@xmath10 is the qcd coupling constant ) , has been studied and confirmed via lattice simulation of @xmath11 gauge theory@xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "it is hard , however , to say on theoretical grounds whether @xmath6 @xmath12 can be considered small in real world where @xmath13 without actually solving qcd for finite @xmath5 .",
    "this is so because the answer depends crucially on how large are the coefficients companying with the expanding parameter @xmath6 , the t hooft s coupling @xmath14 , which is assumed to be fixed to ensure the @xmath11 qcd(the one - loop gluon vacuum polarization , for instance ) to have a smooth limit as @xmath5 tends to infinity .",
    "as argued recently by weinberg@xcite , the t hooft s coupling @xmath0 may not be small at moderate energies such as the scale of @xmath15 since the masses of the @xmath16 mesons @xmath17is of order of @xmath18 in the chiral limit .",
    "combining the @xmath6 expansion of qcd with the early idea of the chiral theory weinberg79,manohargeorgi , weinberg proposed a large-@xmath5 chiral theory@xcite of quarks , gluons , and pions which is effectively renormalizable to leading order of @xmath6 .",
    "he suggests that such an effective field theory , with a small value of the ",
    "t hooft coupling @xmath0 at moderate energies , may explain why the naive quark model are so successful .",
    "it remains unknown how small @xmath0 could be in the effective theory .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to estimate the value of the t hooft coupling @xmath0 in the quark picture of baryons with pion included .",
    "we determine , in a large-@xmath5 chiral quark model that is inspired by the weinberg s large-@xmath19 effective theory , the t hooft coupling by computing the mass splittings of the ground - state octet and decuplet baryons with the help of witten s hartree picture and mapping them to the data of baryon masses .",
    "the t hooft coupling @xmath0 is found to be about @xmath0 @xmath20 .",
    "this infer that when pion enters in the quark picture @xmath0  can be considered small in the sense that @xmath21  @xmath4 .",
    "the model we utilized here is a potential version of the large-@xmath5 effective theory@xcite where the gluon interaction is effectively described by the hartree potentials with the form of the coulomb plus string potential .",
    "conceptually , it resembles the ( topological ) chiral bag model @xcite in the sense that the role of bag is played by the string - like confining potential , with the chiral symmetry implemented via the quark - pion interaction .",
    "inspired by the large-@xmath5 qcd and the chiral theories@xcite , we use a large-@xmath5 chiral model of baryon@xcite in which each of quark @xmath22 in baryon moves in the confining hartree potential of all @xmath23 others , coupling with the pion in an invariant way under chiral symmetry .",

    "the scalar and vector interactions , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , stand for the effective qcd gluon interaction , which can be approximated by the string potential and the one - gluon - exchange(oge ) interaction , while @xmath30is the chiral interaction that @xmath26 is involved , with @xmath31 the pion decay constant .",
    "the chiral dynamics @xmath32 of the pion mesons @xmath33 is chosen , for simplicity , be the skyrme lagrangianskyrme,@xmath34^{2 } ,   \\label{sk}\\]]with the chiral field @xmath35 being the nonlinear representation of the goldstone bosons , @xmath36 . here , @xmath31 and  the self - coupling @xmath37 of the chiral field scales like @xmath38 , while @xmath39(thereby @xmath40 ) @xmath41 in the @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we note that the addingdiakonov of the term @xmath42 in ( [ chqm ] ) is used to restore chiral symmetry @xmath43 under which @xmath44 .",
    "the model ( [ chqm ] ) is invariant under chiral symmetry and can be viewed , in a sense , as a potential version of the large-@xmath5 effective theoryweinberg10 in that instead of using gluon interaction , we use the hartree potentials @xmath28 and @xmath45 to effectively describe the flavor - independent part of the color confining interactions between the valence quarks in baryon , which are assumed to arise from the gluon interaction at long and short distance limit , respectively . for the explicit form of @xmath28 and @xmath45 in ( [ chqm ] )",

    "thus , the hartree potentials ( [ sv ] ) scale as @xmath58 , being consistent with the argument in @xcite .",

    "we describe our treatment of the strong coupling @xmath61 in ( [ sv ] ) as follows . with @xmath62 quark flavors and the quark masses much less than the momentum transfer @xmath63",
    ", the strong coupling @xmath61 is running with @xmath64 , in lowest - order qcd , like @xmath65since @xmath66 , @xmath67 is small for @xmath68 @xmath69 , but for any @xmath70 the above perturbative formula diverges as @xmath71 , which signals the onset of confinement . since in the soft regime we are working we can not avoid this divergence , we need to regularize @xmath67 , by assuming@xcite , for instance , that it saturates at some critical value @xmath72 as @xmath73 . in the work @xcite , the running behavior of @xmath67 has the form of @xmath74 in the coordinate space through the fourier transformation , with @xmath75 the error function .",
    "we parametrize this behavior in a simple form @xmath76with @xmath77 the infrared cutoff ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the potential @xmath45 in ( [ sv ] ) , with @xmath79 specified by ( running ) , is shown in .",
    "inclusion of the second ( skyrme ) term in ( [ sk ] ) may raise issues of double counting of baryons probed in the structure of skyrmions , and this contribution may invalidate the argument of baryon number double counting . ] , since the purely pionic part of the lagrangian [ chqm ] can have skyrmion solutions , with masses of order @xmath19@xcite , in addition to the @xmath5-quark states described above .",
    "here , the nontrivial solution of the skyrme lagrangian ( [ sk ] ) carries a topological charge@xcite @xmath80 known as baryon number , which may violate the baryon number @xmath81 .",
    "this is the case if one ignores the nontrivial vacuum effect that may arise from the spectral asymmetry of the quark states .",
    "however , as rho et .",
    "@xcite noted , the quark spectrum is not symmetric about zero energy and therefore that the quark vacuum can carry nonzero baryon number , @xmath82where the sum",
    "is taken over all positive- and negative energy single - particle eigenstates of quark with the level @xmath83 .    while no general proof is available , we argue , by analogy with the proofgoldstone in chiral bag model , that when applying ( [ chqm ] ) to a baryon the contribution @xmath84 to baryon number from the quark vacuum polarization ( spectrum asymmetry ) due to the nontrivial boundary conditions and the contribution @xmath85 from the skyrmion conceals exactly , @xmath86,@xmath51leaving a unity baryon number in total , @xmath87 . here , the baryon numbers carried by pion are defined@xcite as@xmath88 .",

    "the grounds for the analogy with the chiral bag comes from the observation that the numbers in ( [ bvac ] ) and ( [ bpion ] ) are topological in their nature in the sense that they are invariant upon smoothly varying of the solutions to the model ( [ chqm ] ) insofar as the boundary condition for @xmath90 and @xmath39 remain intact .",
