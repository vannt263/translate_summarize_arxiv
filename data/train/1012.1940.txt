    "the interplay of superconducting and magnetism , two competing orderings , has been long studied .",
    "a new superconducting state may arise , the so - called fflo state , where both the superconducting order parameters and the magnetic ordering are nonuniform @xcite .",
    "the interplay of superconductivity and magnetism can be naturally studied in s / f heterostructures ( s : superconductor , f : ferromagnet ) , where a spatial separation of the two competing orderings can enhance and somehow control the interaction between superconductivity and magnetism .",
    "the physics of s / f heterostructures has been deeply studied @xcite in recent years , and new , interesting aspects were theoretically predicted and in some cases experimentally confirmed . as an example , it has been predicted that the proximity - induced superconducting order parameter does not simply decay in the f layer as in nonmagnetic metals .",
    "instead , it oscillates in the depth of the f layer with a scale given by the coherence length in the f layer , @xmath0 .",
    "this behaviour gives rise to spectacular phenomena , such as the oscillations of @xmath1 with @xmath2 , the thickness of the f layer @xcite , instead of a monotonous depression of @xmath1 with @xmath2 itself . also , the vortex state and pinning properties in s / f structures , or in s films with f particles , dots , pillars , wires etc .",
    "@xcite received much attention .    among the many properties that can give important contributions to the understanding of the physical background of superconductors , and thus of s / f heterostructures , stand the microwave response",
    "indeed , the temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xmath3 , giving access to the temperature dependence of the superfluid density @xmath4 , has been measured in some s / f bilayers and s / f / s trilayers : measurements on nb / cumn bilayers @xcite revealed a temperature dependent superfluid fraction largely different from the case of superconducting / normal metal bilayers , suggesting a temperature - independent proximity induced correlation length .",
    "mn impurities in nb / cu bylayers did not affect the estimated zero - temperature @xmath3 @xcite . in nb / ni bilayers @xcite the temperature dependence of the superfluid density and the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath5 were found to be consistent with significant superfluid density inside the f layer .",
    "while there is certainly need for additional measurements of the penetration depth , it is surprising that there seem to be no measurements at all of the vortex state complex resistivity at radio and microwave frequencies , as opposed to conventional superconductors @xcite , diborides @xcite , cuprates @xcite , nanostructured high-@xmath1 superconductors @xcite .",
    "such measurements can be particularly useful since they give direct access to the pinning constant and the free - flux - flow resistivity ( see below ) .",
    "thus , we started an experimental investigation of the microwave properties of s / f / s heterostructures in the vortex state .",
    "microwave resonators are a well - established technique to measure with high resolution the complex resistivity of thin superconducting films in the vortex state @xcite .",
    "however , the resonators lack the capability to perform measurements in an extended ( and continuous ) frequency range .",
    "since no measurements exist of the vortex state microwave resistivity in s / f heterostructures , it would be hazardous to rely on single - frequency measurements to draw conclusions on the usually complicated response in the vortex state .",
    "thus , we applied to s / f / s trilayers the nonresonant , wideband corbino disk technique @xcite : the technique is able to reliably extract the resistivity in a rather wide frequency range , conservatively between 1 and 20 ghz .",
    "it is then possible to compare the measurements to a wide class of models to get the important vortex state parameters .    before describing with some detail the technique , we briefly recall the expectations of the frequency - dependent complex resistivity in the vortex state , @xmath6 , as calculated within mean field models with a static magnetic induction field @xmath7 perpendicular to the microwave currents . at microwave frequencies the vortex displacement due to the force exerted by the alternate currents @xmath8 is very small @xcite , and it is customary to write down the equation of forces ( per unit length ) acting on a single vortex line in the local limit as follows @xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the vortex velocity , @xmath11 is the unit vector along the vortex , @xmath12 is the flux quantum , @xmath13 is the lorentz force exerted on the flux line and the stochastic force @xmath14 takes into account thermal effects , responsible for fluxon jumps between pinning sites .",
    "the viscous drag coefficient @xmath15 , which is also commonly referred to as vortex viscosity , takes into account the power dissipated by moving vortices due to , e.g. , the relaxation processes of quasiparticles and scattering processes due to currents flowing in the vortex cores @xcite .",
    "as such , it bears informations related to the microscopic electronic state .",
    "the effects of pinning are represented by the force @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the spatial function describing the pinning potential .",
    "the appearance of a hall term in ( [ eq : forces ] ) can be neglected in superconductors in the dirty limit .    from the basic equation of motion ( [ eq",
    ": forces ] ) , many models can be derived , differing essentially for the impact of thermal effects and elasticity of the vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown @xcite that the seemingly large variety of models yield expressions for the vortex resistivity @xmath6 that can be cast in a single , very general expression : @xmath18 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath19 is a measure of the weight of creep phenomenon , @xmath20 is the measuring frequency and @xmath21 is the main characteristic frequency governing the vortex relaxation phenomena . with respect to the well - known depinning frequency @xcite @xmath22",
    ", one has @xmath23 when @xmath24 , that is when thermal effects can be neglected ( one should mention that this is the approximation under which most of microwave measurements in conventional superconductors have been interpreted in the past ) .",
    "the flux - flow resistivity @xmath25 represents the vortex resistivity in absence of any pinning and creep effect , that is the _ ideal _ vortex flow resistivity . as it can be seen , it is possible to obtain the true flux flow resistivity by simply increasing sufficiently the measuring frequency @xmath20 , without the need for ( a ) ultrapure samples and ( b ) high transport currents as in dc , with the related technical problems due to heating .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath6 as described by ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) is depicted in figure [ figteo ] as a function of the reduced frequencies @xmath26 in the range @xmath27 . as it can be seen , the real part of the vortex resistivity @xmath28 contains basically the entire information on the vortex parameters , @xmath29 .",
    "thus , measurements of @xmath28 over a sufficiently wide frequency range are of primary importance .",
    "aim of this paper is to show how the swept - frequency corbino disk technique can be a valuable tool in the study of the vortex state resistivity , in particular in s / f heterostructures : the little role played by the models in the analysis of the data , together with the power of swept - frequency data make the corbino disk an ideal probe of new materials where one can not rely on known properties .",
    "we also present the first measurements of the frequency - dependent vortex resistivity in two s / f / s trilayers , and we show that differences emerge with respect to simple nb even at extremely small @xmath2 .     as a function of the reduced frequency @xmath26 plotted on the basis of equation [ eq : rhovm ] .",
    "full line : @xmath28 , dashed line : @xmath30 .",
    "the direct determination of the vortex parameters @xmath29 is indicated in the figure.,width=377 ]    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the corbino disk technique , with the expressions linking the measured quantities and the complex resistivity of superconducting films in the vortex state . in section [ exp ]",
    "we briefly describe our samples , and we present the experimental data for the complex resistivity taken in a nb film and two nb / pdni / nb trilayers , with different thickness of the f layer .",
    "we summarize the results and suggest further developments in section [ conc ] .",
    "we have developed in the past the corbino disk technique @xcite , following the pioneering work ( in the context of superconductivity ) of the maryland group @xcite .",
    "the technique is conceptually elementary , consisting in the termination of a coaxial cable with the sample under study and the measurement of the complex reflection coefficient @xmath31 . in our particular case , we measured the complex reflection coefficient by means of a vector network analyser , or vna ( we performed most part of the measurements with an agilent - hp 8510c , and a smaller part of the measurements with an anritsu 37269 d ) , connected to a microwave line made up of commercial coaxial cables with physical cutoff frequency at 60 ghz . in principle , from the measured @xmath31 one can extract the real and imaginary part of the complex resistivity of a sample terminating the cable .",
    "the practical realization turns out to be far from being trivial .",
    "the technique is inherently nonresonant , and the reflection coefficient is heavily affected by losses in the cable , phase stability of the cable itself and standing wave in the necessarily long microwave line connecting the sample in the cryostat to the external vna .",
    "the achievable sensitivity of the measurement depends crucially on the calibration and on the characteristics of the vna employed . while very small signals can be in principle detected with a full calibration ( by using three known standard loads , typically an open , a short and a load of known impedance ) ,",
    "this is not feasible in the present case : since both temperature at sample position and temperature gradients along the cable affect the transmission line , the conventional calibration is almost impossible to achieve .",
    "thus , an approximate calibration , with the sample in - situ , has to be used , as detailed below .",
    "we remark that the approximate calibration is the limiting factor in assessing the sensitivity of the present measurements . as a rule of thumb , and with some conservative overestimates , in our present setup and with the chosen calibration procedure no signal below 1% of the normal state of the superconducting sample can be detected with sufficient reliability .",
    "however , the invaluable advantage of swept - frequency measurements compensates for the reduced sensitivity with respect to , e.g. , resonator - based microwave measurements .",
    "we described elsewhere @xcite both the measuring cell and the issues related to the measurement procedure , with particular attention to calibration issues .",
    "we here recall the basic aspects of the technique and the specific calibration method here employed .",
    "the reflection coefficient at the sample surface @xmath32 is related to the impedance of the sample @xmath33 through the relation @xcite    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the characteristic ( wave ) impedance of the dielectric which fills the cable .",
    "( vacuum impedance ) if the last section of the cable is not filled with the dielectric . in practice ,",
    "the device ( launcher ) actually placed at the terminal section of the cable to make the contact between the coaxial cable and the sample , does not include any dielectric but introduces an additional contribution which in general requires to experimentally determine @xmath35 . ] for thin films ( that is , for films whose thickness is lower than the penetration depth ) the sample complex resistivity @xmath36 is related to the sample impedance through the relation @xmath37 , so that @xcite @xmath38 unfortunately , a direct measure of @xmath32 is impossible .",
    "one measures instead ( see figure [ fig : corbinoline ] ) the reflection coefficient at the beginning of the microwave line @xmath39 , which is related to @xmath32 through cable coefficients that should be determined through some calibration procedure .",
    "since those coefficients depend on temperature and temperature gradients of the cable , a full calibration is in general not possible .",
    "this crucial problem can be partially overcome @xcite by making use of a calibration procedure which allows to obtain _ variations _ of @xmath40 with some external parameter ( e.g. , the temperature @xmath41 , the applied magnetic field @xmath42 ) . for instance , by measuring @xmath39 at two different temperatures , it is possible to obtain the sample impedance difference between the two measured temperatures .",
    "this procedure is based on the hypothesis that most of the cable parameters vary only smoothly with temperature .",
    "this hypothesis can be verified through the measured data @xcite . assuming this hypothesis is valid , it can be shown that the measured reflection coefficient @xmath39 can be related to the reflection coefficient @xmath32 at the film surface through the relation    @xmath43    the complex coefficient @xmath44 describes in a compact way the residual cable contribution to the measurement . in the present measurements of the vortex state response ,",
    "it is essential that this quantity is field independent : non - magnetic cables and connectors have to be used .    by focusing on field sweep measurements ( i.e. measures performed by varying the field at fixed @xmath45 ) ,",
    "it is possible to derive @xmath46 by considering data taken at the two distinct fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    at @xmath49",
    ", one has @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the reflection coefficient and surface impedance of the sample in the normal state . for superconducting samples in the thin film limit , @xmath53 is a frequency independent real quantity ( since the plasma frequency of the material is usually much higher than the measuring frequency ) lower than @xmath35 , which is also real . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath51 is frequency independent , real and negative .    at @xmath47",
    ", one has @xmath54 . at low frequencies and not too close to @xmath1 , @xmath55\\ll z_0",
    "$ ] so that @xmath56 . :",
    "the latter involves the additional requirement @xmath57\\ll z_0 $ ] .",
    "this is quite useful for the case of thin superconducting films , where usually @xmath58 . ]    therefore , at low frequencies the ratio @xmath59 , which is a frequency independent constant .",
    "an example based on the measurements on the nb sample is reported in figure [ fig : g0n ] .",
    "it can be seen that , apart a residual oscillation at high frequency , that remains within 3% , the frequency independence of @xmath51 holds .     at various temperatures for sample nb .",
    "@xmath51 can be estimated precisely in the low frequency range @xmath60 ghz , where the measured response is constant as expected . at higher frequencies residual oscillations , within 3% ,",
    "remains after the approximate calibration procedure.,width=377 ]    since @xmath51 is a frequency - independent quantity , it is possible to estimate it by using low frequency data only , @xmath60 ghz .",
    "it is then possible to determine @xmath46 , the important frequency - dependent cable coefficient , which contains @xmath51 as a proportionality constant , according to : @xmath61 and then used to extract @xmath62 for each set of measurements corresponding to a field sweep at fixed @xmath41 . finally , by using ( [ zs ] ) the frequency - dependent resistivity can be obtained . in the present measurements",
    "there is the additional advantage that the normal state resistivity @xmath63 at low temperature of our samples is not temperature dependent .",
    "thus , @xmath51 does not depend on temperature either and once obtained at one temperature the value can be used to derive @xmath64 at all @xmath41 .",
    "one should remark that this kind of calibration is feasible only on thin films , where @xmath51 is frequency - independent : the same procedure can not be applied to the study of bulk materials ( e.g. , single crystals ) , being in this case @xmath51 dependent on the frequency . in this case , one should develop an alternative , sample - in - situ , calibration . using ( [ zs ] ) and ( [ extalpha ] ) one finally obtains for the sample complex resistivity @xmath65 : @xmath66 @xmath67 where we have used the approximations @xmath68 and @xmath69 [ where @xmath70 , which hold true since @xmath71 is small .",
    "these expressions clearly show that the real part of the resistivity can be obtained solely by the modulus of the reflection coefficient , whereas the imaginary part strongly depends on the phase . on practical grounds ,",
    "this is a relevant remark : whenever thermal or other instabilities affect the cable response , they impact largely and mainly on the measurement of the phase rather than on the modulus : in these cases , the above expressions show that although the imaginary part of the resistivity would be largely affected , the real part would still remain reliably determined . in the measurements here presented we limit ourself to the extraction of the more reliable real part of the resistivity , @xmath72 .",
    "in this section we present experimental results for the frequency - dependent real part of the resistivity in the mixed state in three superconducting samples : a pure nb film of 20 nm nominal thickness and two nb / pd@xmath73ni@xmath74/nb trilayers .",
    "the samples were fabricated at university of salerno / cnr - spin .",
    "they were grown by ultra - high - vacuum , dc magnetron sputtering .",
    "the films and heterostructures were grown at room temperature , and the thickness was carefully calibrated against deposition rate , following the procedure described in more details elsewhere @xcite . since",
    "microwave measurements can be seriously distorted by the use of semiconducting substrates , as extensively discussed previously @xcite , samples were deposited on crystalline sapphire ( al@xmath75o@xmath76 ) instead of the more common choice of si .",
    "we focused the attention on samples with small @xmath2 , in order to assess whether ferromagnetic layers thinner than the coherence length in the ferromagnet , @xmath0 , can give rise to detectable features in the transport properties , apart the well - known drop in @xmath1 @xcite . since in nb / pdni / nb one estimates @xmath77 3 - 4 nm @xcite , we have considered here the following three samples : a nb thin films ( sample nb ) , with nominal thickness @xmath7820 nm , as a reference , and two trilayers with nominal nb thickness @xmath79 15 nm for upper and lower layers and pdni thickness @xmath80 1 nm and 2 nm ( samples t1 and t2 , respectively ) .",
    "the normal state dc resistivity was in all cases @xmath81 cm .",
    "the main characteristic parameters are reported in the table .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath1 and the upper critical fields @xmath82 were estimated from the disappearance of the microwave signal , and were found in good agreement with the dc data . the magnetic field @xmath42 was applied perpendicular to the film plane .    as described in section [ tech ] , by measuring the changes with the applied magnetic field @xmath42 of the frequency - dependent complex reflection coefficient of the samples we derived the field - increase of @xmath83 on the basis of the equation ( [ rho1finale ] ) .",
    "apart from a very narrow region in the @xmath84 phase diagram close to the transition line @xmath85 , we do not expect a detectable contribution of pairbreaking at our working frequency , so that we entirely ascribe the measured signal to the vortex resistivity .",
    "we anticipate that the frequency dependence of the measured real resistivity is well described by the general theoretical expression ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) , with no need for other contributions , thus adding confidence in the assumption .",
    "for this reason , when dealing with experimental quantity we will use the symbol @xmath28 for the experimental field increase of the real resistivity . in order to directly compare different samples",
    ", we report in the following the normalized resistivity , @xmath86 .",
    "measurements have been taken approximately at the same reduced temperature @xmath87 to compare similar thermal properties , and at the same magnetic fields @xmath880.6 and 0.8 t in order to have the same vortex density .",
    "sufficiently large magnetic fields have been chosen in order to examine also the creep factor in the three samples , which becomes negligibly small at lower fields .    in figure [ fignb ]",
    "we report @xmath28 in the nb sample taken at @xmath894.5 k. we first notice the appearance of steps in @xmath28 at the larger field .",
    "the resistivity switches toward a more dissipative ( larger @xmath28 ) state and then decays abruptly , then switches again .",
    "we remark that , to the best of our knowledge , such instabilities have not been reported before .",
    "in particular , a time - domain analysis reveals that the switching phenomena here reported have a very long typical time scale , @xmath901s @xcite .",
    "we will not focus further on this anomalous behaviour , that is presently under study .",
    "we mention that it is invariably present in our measurements , although somehow sample - dependent , it is generally more evident approaching the superconducting transition , taken close to @xmath82 , no switches are evident . ] and completely disappears in the normal state ( i.e. , for @xmath91 or @xmath45 ) .",
    "this behaviour has been verified with both vnas .",
    "further details and a characterization of the phenomenon have been given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we focus instead on the  conventional \" behaviour , indicated in figure [ fignb ] by full symbols , that we compare to the theoretical expression ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) .     as a function of the frequency @xmath20 in the nb sample , at two different magnetic fields and @xmath894.5 k. symbols : experimental data ; open symbols : data in the  switched \" state ( see text ) .",
    "continuous lines : fits with the general expression ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) , with parameters reported in the table.,width=377 ]    directly from the data it can be seen that the vortex characteristic frequency lies well within our measuring range of 1 - 22 ghz , as indicated by the steep rise in @xmath86 . as a consequence , we are able to observe the free - flux - flow plateau in @xmath28 at the high edge of our measuring range . a quantitative fit with ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) is reported in figure [ fignb ] .",
    "the fit is in good agreement with the data , and it gives the value for the vortex parameters reported in the table .",
    "we note the rather high value of the characteristic frequency , @xmath925 and 6 ghz at @xmath930.6 and 0.8 t , respectively .",
    "this result is consistent with the depinning frequency in nb thin films as measured with single - frequency resonators @xcite , and it indicates quite a strong pinning in our nb film .",
    "we also note that the normalized flux - flow resistivity @xmath94 by a significant factor .",
    "this remark is a direct demonstration that the simple bardeen - stephen model @xcite , where the flux flow resistivity @xmath95 with @xmath961 , does not describe well our data . while it should be mentioned that , when a full time - dependent ginzburg - landau calculation is performed , @xmath25 can be much smaller than the bs value @xcite",
    ", it seems that this result , which we recall is independent from a particular model for vortex motion , calls for further studies of the flux flow resistivity in conventional superconductors .",
    "measurements are presently in progress .",
    "finally , we remark that a significant creep exists at the higher measuring field , @xmath97t@xmath98 .",
    "this is an interesting feature , since the role of creep is often neglected in the analysis of high - frequency data in conventional superconductors @xcite , under the assumption that it is relevant only extremely close to the transition .",
    "we notice that recent low - temperature , multifrequency microwave measurements in conventional superconductors revealed some contribution from flux creep @xcite .",
    "it appears that multifrequency or , like in the present work , swept - frequency measurements are a particularly suitable tool to directly uncover features in the vortex state resistivity .",
    "we propose a framework in order to explain the pinning and creep features found in the present measurements .",
    "first , one should consider that at microwave frequencies the flux lines undergo very small displacements around their equilibrium position . in this sense ,",
    "the pinning probed by the microwave response concerns the curvature at the bottom of the potential well , and has ( as a first approximation ) nothing to do with the height of the pinning well itself .",
    "this is a significant difference with respect to conventional dc measurements and pinning , as measured by the critical current density @xmath99 , is essentially dictated by the height of the potential wells .",
    "by contrast , creep is determined by the height of the wells both at microwaves and in dc .",
    "the present measurements can then be explained in terms of rather steep , but not very deep pinning wells : the pinning - related parameter @xmath100 , being rather high , points to steep pinning wells , while the large creep factor indicates that the pinning wells themselves are not particularly deep .",
    "a check of this framework comes from the magnetic field dependence of the vortex parameters : increasing the field should first reduce the height of the pinning wells , and only as a further effect it should affect the shape of the bottom of the well .",
    "this behaviour should result in a quickly increasing creep factor with the field , and a weakly field dependent depinning frequency ( until @xmath82 is approached , where the pinning potential flattens and the characteristic frequency vanishes ) .",
    "in fact , it can be seen in the table that with increasing field @xmath100 does not drop quickly , while @xmath101 increases significantly ( anticipating the results obtained in the trilayers , we observe the same trend , even if @xmath82 and pinning are smaller in sample t2 ) .",
    "the physics at high driving frequency differs from the better known flux motion processes in dc : at low dc currents the motion of flux lines arises as flux bundles @xcite , which require quite a large activation energy .",
    "hence , the small creep factor as seen in dc unless the current is raised .",
    "by contrast , the motion at microwave frequencies is much closer to the single - fluxon motion , as shown by the study of the elastic force matrix for the flux lattice @xcite : with increasing frequency , the range of the transmitted forces between fluxons drops thus yielding the single - vortex regime . in this case , the activation energies related to single vortex creep are smaller @xcite .",
    "having determined the vortex parameters in nb , we turn to the analysis of the data in the trilayers .     as a function of the frequency @xmath20 in the trilayer t1 , with 1 nm pdni thickness , at two different magnetic fields and @xmath894.5 k. symbols : experimental data .",
    "continuous lines : fits with the general expression ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) , with parameters reported in the table .",
    "the frequency dependence of @xmath28 is very similar to analogous data for the reference nb sample ( figure [ fignb]).,width=377 ]    figure [ figt1 ] reports @xmath86 in sample t1 , together with the fits with ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) .",
    "it turns out that sample t1 , where the pdni thickness is limited to @xmath1021 nm , has a behaviour very close to the nb film for what concerns the vortex resistivity .",
    "the effect of the f layer seems limited to the reduction of @xmath1 by about 1.2 k with respect to a single nb film of thickness 30 nm @xcite .",
    "the vortex parameters are reported in the table .",
    "again , direct indications of strong pinning and significant creep is found , and @xmath94 .",
    "the same considerations already stated for nb are valid .",
    "it seems that @xmath1021 nm is not sufficient to affect the vortex state resistivity in our s / f / s trilayers .     as a function of the frequency @xmath20 in the trilayer t2 , with 2 nm pdni thickness , at two different magnetic fields and @xmath893.66 k. symbols : experimental data .",
    "continuous lines : fits with the general expression ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) , with parameters reported in the table .",
    "it can be directly seen from the data that the frequency dependence of @xmath28 is different with respect to the reference nb sample and to the trilayer with @xmath2= 1 nm ( figures [ fignb ] and [ figt1 ] , respectively).,width=377 ]    the data for sample t2 are presented in figure [ figt2 ] , again with the fits obtained using ( [ eq : rhovm ] ) . even if the thickness of the f layer is only 2 nm , significant differences with nb and trilayer t1 appear .",
    "first , pinning is significantly reduced , as evident from the much steeper raise in @xmath86 . performing the fits",
    ", one finds that the characteristic vortex frequency is reduced by an appreciable amount with respect to nb and trilayer t1 , while creep does not change much .",
    "however , the most remarkable feature is the value of the flux flow resistivity . in this case",
    "we find @xmath103 , which is _ above _ the bs value .",
    "this finding can not be easily explained , and clearly calls for further investigations .",

    "we have used a wideband technique , the corbino disk technique , capable to obtain reliable measurements in the frequency range 1 - 22 ghz . in nb , significant creep is detected and a previously unobserved  switching \" behaviour is found approaching the transition line . in trilayers",
    "the experimental data show that , even when the f thickness @xmath2 is as thin as half of the coherence length in the ferromagnet , @xmath0 , the superconducting state changes from the pure superconductor in a way that the vortex state resistivity is affected . by exploiting the wideband technique ,",
    "we have shown that changes in the free - flux - flow resistivity are the most relevant , since one obtains @xmath25 in excess of the bs limit @xmath112 .",
    "in addition , one observes a reduced pinning .",
    "by contrast , the trilayer with @xmath2 = 1 nm does not exhibit any qualitative difference with respect to the nb reference sample .",
    "our observations call for further study of the vortex state resistivity in s / f / s heterostructures , which are presently in progress .",
