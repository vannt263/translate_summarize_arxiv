    "in recent years , the study of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flow of blood through artery has gained considerable interest because of its physiological applications .",
    "investigations on mhd flow and heat transfer of non - newtonian fluids over a stretching sheet also find many important applications in engineering and industry .",
    "for example in the extrusion of a polymer sheet from a die , the sheet is sometimes stretched .",
    "the properties of the end product depend considerably on the rate of cooling . by drawing such a sheet in a visco - elastic electrically conducting",
    "fluid subjected to the action of a magnetic field , the rate of cooling can be controlled and the final product can be obtained with desired characteristics . crane@xcite",
    "investigated the problem of steady two - dimensional incompressible boundary layer flow engendered by the stretching of an elastic flat sheet which moves in its plane with a velocity varying linearly with distance from a fixed point due to application of a uniform stress .",
    "misra et al.@xcite studied the hall effect on the steady mhd boundary layer flow of an incompressible viscous and electrically conducting fluid past a stretching surface in the presence of a uniform transverse magnetic field .",
    "+   +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     it may be noted that for values of m @xmath0 200 , the points where the reverse flow set in are quite close to each other .",
    "the interesting observation of flow reversal owes to its origin to the stretching of the channel wall .",
    "it is also revealed that in the vicinity of the boundary layer , the axial velocity decreases with the increase in the magnetic field strength .",
    "this observation leads to a very important suggestion that one can avoid flow reversal ( studied here ) by applying a sufficient strong magnetic field .",
    "8 and 9 depict the spatial variation of velocity components for different values of the viscoelastic parameter @xmath1 . from these two figures",
    "one can a very important observation that for a purely hydrodynamic flow ( in the absence of any magnetic field ) the velocity of blood decreases with the increase in the value of the viscoelastic parameter , but under the action of a sufficient strong magnetic field , velocity is least affected by blood viscoelasticity",
    "10 - 11 give the spatial variation of temperature for different values of the magnetic parameter m and the different values of the viscoelastic parameter @xmath1 .",
    "from these figures we learn that the temperature increases with the increase in the magnetic field strength and the viscoelastic parameter .",
    "it thus turns out that under the action of a magnetic field , in an electrically conducting fluid ( e.g. blood ) , there develops a resistive force ( lorentz force ) which causes impedance of flow and enhancement of temperature .",
    "further , fig .",
    "12 shows that under the action of a sufficient strong magnetic field the temperature of blood decreases with the increase in prandtl number .",
    "the flow of a magnetohydrodynamic fluid in a channel with stretching walls and an associated problem of heat transfer have been the concern of this paper . the study is particularly motivated towards the flow and heat transfer of blood in a vessel having stretching wall .",
    "it bears the potential to examine the variation of blood velocity as the magnetic field strength ( m ) , fluid ( blood ) viscoelasticity ( measured by @xmath1 ) and thermal diffusivity ( which is related to the prandtl number @xmath2 ) .",
    "the study reveals that the flow reversal can be eliminated and the vessel wall temperature can be controlled by applying a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "+ the observation of the study that temperature increases as the strength of the magnetic field increases is likely to be useful in the development of new heating methods .",
    "it can also have significant clinical application of hyperthemia in cancer therapy .",
    "the objective of hyperthemia in cancer therapy is to raise the temperature of cancerous tissues above a therapeutic value @xmath3c while maintaining the surrounding normal tissue at sublethal temperature @xcite .",
    "the data reported here through different graphs should be of interest to medical persons in the treatment of various health problems , including arrest of cancerous tumor growths and to achieve the goal for monitoring of the tumor and normal tissue temperatures . .",
