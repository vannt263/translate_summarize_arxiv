    "a measurement of the statistics of the primordial perturbations can provide an even more discriminating test of models of the early universe : _ all _ canonical single - field slow - roll inflation models predict that the perturbations are observationally indistinguishable from gaussian @xcite .",

    "however , most models that predict a significant level of non - gaussianity also predict a non - zero connected trispectrum ( the non - gaussian part of the harmonic - space four - point function ) @xcite , and some efforts have been mounted to detect a primordial non - gaussian signature from the trispectrum @xcite . in this way",
    "a constraint on the trispectrum amplitude provides unique information on a broad range of early - universe processes such as multi - field inflation models @xcite , the curvaton senario @xcite , inflation models with non - standard kinetic terms @xcite , and the influence of primordial cosmic strings @xcite .",

''",
    "we will see below that something like this occurs with measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "a calculation of these pdfs is particularly important for measurements of non - gaussianity ( as opposed , for example , for the cmb power spectrum ) , because the estimator is a sum over products of three ( in the case of @xmath28 ) or four ( in the case of @xmath0 ) temperature measurements .",

    "<S> considerable recent attention has focussed on the prospects to use the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) trispectrum to probe the physics of the early universe . here </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the standard estimator @xmath0 for the amplitude @xmath1 of the cmb trispectrum both for the null - hypothesis ( i.e. , for gaussian maps with @xmath2 ) and for maps with a non - vanishing trispectrum ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find these pdfs to be _ highly _ non - gaussian in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the variance with which the trispectrum amplitude can be measured , @xmath4 , as a function of its underlying value , @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a strong dependence of this variance on @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the variance does not , given the highly non - gaussian nature of the pdf , effectively characterize the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> detailed knowledge of these pdfs will therefore be imperative in order to properly interpret the implications of any given trispectrum measurement . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if a cmb experiment with a maximum multipole of @xmath5 ( such as the planck satellite ) measures @xmath6 then at the 95% confidence our calculations show that we can conclude @xmath7 ; assuming a gaussian pdf but with the correct @xmath1-dependent variance we would incorrectly conclude @xmath8 ; further neglecting the @xmath1-dependence in the variance we would incorrectly conclude @xmath9 . </S>"
