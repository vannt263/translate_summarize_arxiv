    "impacts of network structures on the dynamical processes attract special attentions in recent years , to cite examples , the epidemic spreading on networks [ 1 - 3 ] , the response of complex networks to stimuli [ 4,5 ] and the synchronization of dynamical systems on networks [ 6 - 9].in this paper , we will consider the collective motions on complex networks , just like the phonon in regular lattices .    by means of the random matrix theory ( rmt ) ,",
    "we find that the nearest neighbor level spacing ( nnls ) distributions for spectra of complex networks generated with ws small - world , erdos - renyi and growing randomly network models can be described with brody distribution in a unified way .",
    "this unified description can be used as a new measurement to characterize complex networks .",
    "the results tell us that the topological structure of a complex network can induce a special kind of collective motions . under environmental perturbations",
    ", the collective motion modes can transition between each other abruptly . this kind of sensitivity to outside perturbations is called collective chaos in this paper .",
    "it is found that the properties of the collective chaos are determined only by the structures of the networks . without the aid of the dynamical model presented in references [ 4,5 ] ,",
    "we show for the first time that the dynamics on complex networks can be in collective order , soft chaotic or even hard chaotic states .",
    "wigner , dyson , mehta and others developed the random matrix theory ( rmt ) to understand the energy levels of complex nuclei and other kinds of complex quantum systems [ 10 - 13 ] . in recent literature , the spectral density function and the time series analysis methods are used to capture properties of complex networks [ 14 - 19 ] .",
    "one of the most important concepts in rmt is the nearest neighbor level spacing ( nnls ) distribution .",
    "a general picture emerging from experiments and theories is that if the classical motion of a dynamical system is regular , the nnls distribution of the corresponding quantum system behaves according to a poisson distribution .",
    "if the corresponding classical motion is chaotic , the nnls distribution will behave in accordance with the wigner  dyson ensembles .",
    "this is the content of the famous bohigas conjecture [ 20,21 ] .",
    "hence , the nnls distribution of a quantum system can tell us the dynamical properties of the corresponding classical system .",
    "consider an undirected network of @xmath0coupled identical oscillators .",
    "the hamiltonian reads ,    @xmath6    where , @xmath7 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath8th oscillator , @xmath9 the coupling potential between the @xmath10th and the @xmath8th oscillators and @xmath11 the adjacent matrix of the network .",
    "the hamiltonian of the corresponding quantum system can be represented as ,    @xmath12    assuming the site energy of each oscillator is @xmath13 and the eigenfunction is @xmath14 , we have @xmath15 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath16 reads ,    @xmath17    the pattern of the spectrum of @xmath16 does not dependent on the values of @xmath13 and @xmath18 . assigning @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", we have @xmath21 . by this way",
    ", the spectrum of the adjacent matrix @xmath11 can be used to calculate the nnls distribution of the quantum system . to make our discussion as self - contained as possible , we review briefly the procedure to obtain the nnls distribution from the spectrum of @xmath11 , denoted with @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath0 is the total number of the energy levels .    to ensure that the distances between the energy levels are expressed in units of local mean energy level spacing",
    ", we should first map the energy levels @xmath23 to new variables called `` unfolded energy levels '' @xmath24 .",
    "this procedure is called unfolding , which is generally a non - trivial task [ 22 ] .",
    "define the cumulative density function as ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the density function of the initial energy level spectrum .",
    "we have ,    @xmath27    preprocess the spectrum , @xmath28 , and the corresponding accumulative density function , @xmath29 , so that for each of them the mean is set to zero and the variance equals to @xmath30 , i.e. ,    @xmath31^{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1 $ } \\!\\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { 1 2}}\\right.\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace}\\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$2$}}},\\ ] ]    @xmath32^{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{$1 $ } \\!\\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { 1 2}}\\right.\\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace}\\!\\lower0.7ex\\hbox{$2$}}}.\\ ] ]    dividing the accumulative function @xmath33 into two components , i.e. , the smooth term @xmath34 and the fluctuation term @xmath35 , the unfolded energy levels can be obtained as ,    @xmath36    because we have not enough information on the accumulative density function at present time , a polynomial is employed to describe the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as follows ,    @xmath39    it is found that a large value of @xmath40 can lead to a considerable good fitting result . to guarantee the fitting results exact enough , we assign the value as @xmath41 .    defining the nearest neighbor level spacing ( nnls ) as ,    @xmath42    the brody distribution of the nnls reads ,    @xmath43,\\ ] ]    which is also called weibull distribution in the research field of life data analysis [ 23 ] . in the definition of nnls,@xmath44",

    ", we should divide the interval where the nnls distributes into many bins .",
    "the size of a bin can be chosen to be a fraction of the square root of the variance of the nnls , which reads , @xmath51 . if @xmath52 is unreasonable small , @xmath50 can not capture the exact features in actual probability distribution function ( pdf ) , while a much large @xmath52 will induce strong fluctuations .",
    "the value of the parameter @xmath52 is assigned 20 in this paper , because the fitting results are stable in a considerable wide range about this value .",
    "a brody distribution reveals that the corresponding classical complex system is in a soft chaotic state [ 10 ] .",
    "for the two extreme conditions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the brody distribution will reduce to the poisson and the wigner distributions . and the corresponding classical complex systems are in the hard chaotic and order states , respectively .    for the quantum system considered in this paper",
    ", it can be initially in a quantum state of @xmath55 , corresponding to the eigenvalue of @xmath56 . under a weak environmental perturbation",
    ", the state will display completely different behaviors [ 24 - 26 ] .",
    "if the system is in an order state , the transition probability of the initial state to a new state @xmath57 will decrease rapidly with the increase of @xmath58 , and the transition occurs mainly between the initial state and its neighboring states .",
    "if the system is in a chaotic state , the transitions between all the states in the chaotic regime the initial state belongs to can occur with almost same probabilities . in the classical dynamics , the corresponding states are the collective motion modes , just like phonon in regular lattices . under perturbations",
    "the state of a chaotic system can transition between the collective modes in the same chaotic regime abruptly , while the state of an order system can transition between the initial mode and its neighboring states only .",
    "consequently , the chaotic state of the @xmath0 identical oscillators is a kind of collective behavior rather than the individual properties of each oscillator .",
    "it is called collective chaos in this paper .",
    "the above discussions tell us that this collective chaos dependents only on the structure of the undirected network .",

    "the nnls distribution can capture directly the relation between the structure of a complex network and the dynamics on it .",
