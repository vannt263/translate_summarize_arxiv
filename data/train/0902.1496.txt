    "the question whether physical or biological systems can organize themselves without the intervention of an external factor , is a hot subject in the community of scientists interested in complexity . a practical way to answer such a question is to use a suitable definition of complexity and check if this quantity increases with the number of particles @xmath3 , implying the ability or inability to self - organize .",
    "there are several measures of complexity in the literature .",
    "one of them is the algorithmic complexity according to kolmogorov and chaitin @xcite defined as the length of the shortest possible program necessary to reproduce a given object .",
    "the fact that a given program is indeed the shortest one , is hard to prove . in this paper",
    "we employ the _ statistical _ measure of complexity @xmath8 , defined by l@xmath1pez - ruiz , mancini , and calbet ( lmc ) @xcite , which can be calculated easily , provided that the information content of a quantum system is known from previous work @xcite-@xcite . in the same spirit",
    ", we use the measure of complexity @xmath9 according to shiner , davison and landsberg ( sdl ) @xcite .",
    "we intend to calculate and compare @xmath0 with @xmath10 as functions of the number of particles @xmath3 in four quantum systems , namely atomic nuclei , atoms , atomic clusters , and correlated atoms in a trap  bosons . here",
    ", we use continuous probability density distributions of particles of quantum systems , while in @xcite we obtained @xmath7 using @xmath11 and @xmath12 , taking into account discrete probability distributions of electron configurations in atoms .",
    "it is noted that such complexity measures , based in a probabilistic description of a quantum system , have been calculated quantitatively ( as functions of @xmath13 ) for the first time in @xcite , using atoms as a test bed .",
    "a previous preliminary step was the finding that landsberg s order parameter @xcite is an increasing function of @xmath3 for fermions and bosonic systems @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is to find specific overall values of @xmath7 for each system , by requiring that approximately @xmath6 .",
    "we investigate the possibility whether the pair @xmath7 , chosen in such a way ( podi : pair of order - disorder indices ) is useful for the classification of quantum many - body systems according to the contribution of order and disorder to complexity .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : measures ] we define measures of information and complexity , in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we present our numerical results and sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "shannon s information entropy @xcite , is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are normalized to one density distributions in position and momentum spaces respectively .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 depend on the units used to measure @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while the important quantity is the sum @xmath21 , which is scale invariant i.e. independent of units .",
    "there is a delicate balance between conjugate spaces leading to the following results :    first , the entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) holds of the form @xmath22 for a 3-dimensional quantum system @xcite .",
    "the lower bound is attained for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the above inequality is stronger than the heisenberg uncertainty relation , because the right - hand side of eur does not depend on the state , while heisenberg s does depend .",
    "also heisenberg s inequality can be derived from eur , while the inverse is not true .",
    "@xmath23 represents the information content of the system in bits , if one uses logarithm with base 2 and in nats ( natural unit of information ) , if the logarithm is natural .",
    "second , the universal property @xmath24 was proposed and verified for various quantum systems ( nuclei , atoms , atomic clusters and correlated atoms in a trap ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 depend on the system under consideration .",
    "that property holds for systems of various sizes , obeying different statistics ( fermions or bosons ) with different numbers of particles and various interactions .",
    "specifically , the sizes of those systems range from the order of fermis ( @xmath27 cm ) in nuclei , to @xmath28 @xmath29 ( @xmath30 cm ) for bosonic systems , while the number of particles @xmath3 starts from a few to a hundred and goes up to millions ( bosons ) .",
    "the shiner , davison and landsberg ( sdl ) measure complexity @xmath31 is defined as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the normalized measures of disorder and order respectively , according to landsberg @xcite , obeying the inequalities @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 represents the strength of disorder , while @xmath5 the strength of order .",
    "we have a complexity measure @xmath31 of category i , if @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where complexity is an increasing function of disorder . in category",
    "ii ( @xmath37 ) @xmath31 is a convex function , while in category iii ( @xmath38 ) @xmath31 is a decreasing function of disorder @xmath39 .",
    "the lmc measure @xmath8 @xcite is defined as @xmath40 where @xmath23 denotes the information content stored in the system ( in our case shannon s information entropy sum @xmath21 @xcite ) and @xmath41 is the disequilibrium of the system .    for a discrete probability distribution @xmath42",
    ", the disequilibrium @xmath41 can be defined as the quadratic distance of @xmath42 to the equiprobable ( uniform ) state @xmath43 .",
    "while for a continuous probability distribution @xmath45 , it is extended in position - space as @xmath46 and in momentum - space @xmath47 the extension from the discrete to the continuous case is justified in @xcite .",
    "the proper combination of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , to be inserted into ( 1 ) is @xmath50 in fact @xmath48 has the dimension of inverse volume , while @xmath49 of volume , leading to the dimensionless quantity @xmath41 .",
    "we intend to calculate numerically the lmc measure of complexity @xmath51 and the sdl one , @xmath52 as functions of the number of particles @xmath3 ( electrons in atoms , nucleons in nuclei , valence electrons in atomic clusters , and alkali atoms in bosonic traps ) .",
    "our calculations are facilitated by our previous research in information entropy @xmath23 .",
    "the key quantities of our calculations are the density distributions in position - space @xmath15 and momentum - space @xmath16 , obtained as follows .",
    "for nuclei we performed microscopic mean - field calculations @xcite , using a density - dependent skyrme force , in particular the skiii force @xcite .",
    "for atoms we used the rhf ( roothaan - hartree - fock ) electron distributions @xcite , applied to calculations of atomic complexity @xcite , @xcite . for atomic clusters , we employed the jellium model ( ekcard model ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while for bosons in a trap we carried out a numerical calculation of densities in both position- and momentum - spaces , solving numerically the non - linear gross - pitaevski equation @xcite . in all of the above calculations",
    "special care has been devoted to an accurate treatment of the fourier transform of @xmath15 in order to obtain @xmath16 for each system .",
    "next , the distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 calculated as described above , are inserted into relations ( [ eq : sr ] ) and ( [ eq : sk ] ) giving @xmath53 and @xmath54 for each system , needed to find the sum @xmath55 .",
    "thus , @xmath56 can be obtained easily . however , in order to evaluate @xmath57 , we need in addition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .    for discrete probability distributions the value of @xmath60 , is attained for an equiprobable ( uniform ) density distribution i.e. @xmath61 , where @xmath3 is the number of states with probabilities @xmath62 .",
    "@xmath23 is minimum , @xmath63 , when only one probability is different from 0 , specifically @xmath64 for a fixed @xmath65 , while all the others vanish . for continuous probability distributions , calculations for @xmath66 and @xmath60",
    "are based to the following inequalities , introduced for the first time and verified for atoms by gadre and collaborators @xcite , @xcite , for atomic clusters and nuclei in @xcite and bosonic systems ( correlated alkali atoms in a trap ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath16 are normalized to 1 , i.e. @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the lower and upper limits for density distributions normalized to one , are : @xmath71 and @xmath72 thus @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the mean square radius of the system and @xmath75 its kinetic energy .",
    "we use , as an input in @xmath76 , the values of @xmath60 according to relation ( [ eq : smax ] ) .",
    "we repeated and verified the above inequalities for atoms in @xcite , @xcite and next , we checked their validity numerically for nuclei , atomic clusters and bosonic traps in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath77 and @xmath75 , can be calculated employing @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "thus , we obtain the function @xmath78 for each quantum system .    following the procedure described above ,",
    "we calculate and plot the functions @xmath79 , @xmath78 , @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( for various values @xmath7 ) , and @xmath80 , for all four quantum systems under consideration .",
    "our results are presented for atoms in fig .",
    "[ fig : resatoms ] , atomic clusters in fig . [",
    "fig : rescluster ] , nuclei in fig .",
    "[ fig : resnuclei ] and bosons in a trap in fig .",
    "[ fig : resboson ] .",
    "we note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : resatoms ] we present both the dependence of @xmath8 on all values of @xmath3 and separately the dependence of @xmath8 only on values of @xmath3 for closed shells atoms .",
    "the data of the latter figure is used in the fitting of @xmath81 to @xmath0 .",
    "we also plot linear fitted expressions for @xmath23 and @xmath60 of the form @xmath82 . in order to choose the specific values ( @xmath83 ) ,",
    "we employ a new prescription , described below .",
    "we begin with the requirement that the curves @xmath2 and @xmath0 should coincide ( approximately ) or show the same pattern , for a proper pair of values @xmath7 .",
    "we quantify the similarity between the two curves with a norm @xmath84 , which should be zero in the ideal case , where the two curves are exactly the same .",
    "a comparison of @xmath81 with @xmath0 has been suggested for the first time in @xcite , where we obtained by inspection of the figures that roughly @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) and has been observed that complexity increases with @xmath88 , based on the trend of closed shells .",
    "we limit our search for the optimal pair @xmath7 only for the regions of the @xmath89 plane , where the behavior of the complexity measure @xmath31 is the same with the corresponding behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , if for example , @xmath0 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 , then we search for the proper pair @xmath7 only in the region where @xmath31 is decreasing with @xmath3 .",
    "the trend of complexity is dictated by @xmath0 .",
    "the resulting pair of values @xmath7 is named _ pair of order - disorder indices ( podi)_. we hope that it will serve as a useful tool in order to classify quantum ( or classical ) many body systems , according to the contribution of order versus disorder contributions to complexity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : complexityclass ] , we present our results for all four quantum systems under consideration in the @xmath89 plane with @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , with mesh points @xmath92 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a decreasing behavior is denoted by white color , a convex behavior by grey and an increasing trend by black .",
    "qualitatively , the structure of the corresponding plots in @xmath89 plane and the shape of the complexity regions are the same for all considered quantum systems . a monotonically decreasing region is followed by a convex one and then we have a monotonically increasing area .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ tab : table ] , where in addition we present the approximate linear limits of the three respective complexity regions ( decreasing , convex , increasing ) .",
    ".analysis of results for the podi pair @xmath7 and complexity character of various quantum systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     of all four quantum systems , atoms and bosons are exceptional , in the following sense .",
    "* atoms : in atoms there are very hard oscillations of complexity measures with @xmath3 ( @xmath93 , atomic number ) .",
    "this is displayed in the corresponding ( fourth ) plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : resatoms ] , where we employ , just for the sake of comparison , the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 , originating from the fitting @xmath96 for closed shells ( fifth plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : resatoms ] ) .",
    "it is seen that the overall behavior can not be characterized with certainty as monotonically increasing , decreasing or convex .",
    "it is clear that our proposed two - step procedure to find @xmath7 and the complexity character i.e. first to observe the general trend of @xmath0 and then fit @xmath81 to @xmath0 is not straightforward for atoms , if we insist to employ the dependence of @xmath8 on all the values of the atomic number @xmath88 .",
    "is seems that details of our method should be adjusted , to some extent , to available data and/or the specific system under consideration . + on the other hand , one can find the complexity character based on specific characteristics of the system that may simplify the whole picture ( something that can be useful for further studies of complexity especially in classical chaotic systems ) . in the case of the atoms ,",
    "such a simplification should be the choice of the closed shells atoms .",
    "thus , we organize our results to define decreasing , convex and increasing behavior using the trend of the closed shells atoms ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this choice for atoms implies an increasing trend for @xmath0 and a optimal pair @xmath98 .",
    "the same trend has been observed in a series of papers employing various models and methods @xcite . *",
    "bosons : the increasing area dominates , while a very narrow decreasing area exists for very small values of @xmath5 .",
    "the optimal pair is @xmath99 . extending our calculations in the @xmath89 plane for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 ( we do not display this extension in fig .",
    "[ fig : resboson ] ) , we see that the best sdl - lmc fit is attained for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "regardless of the exact proper value of @xmath4 , which is certainly larger than 120 , we are sure that @xmath104 .",
    "this is a clear indication that a bosonic system is to a high degree disordered , as expected from the absence of the pauli principle .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : resatoms]-[fig : resboson ] and the norms of table [ tab : table ] , that the curves @xmath0 and @xmath105 almost coincide for the optimal @xmath7 in clusters and nuclei , while for atoms and bosons , they show a similar pattern .",
    "this is the best result we can obtain .",
    "it is concluded that three out of the four considered quantum systems ( atomic clusters , nuclei and bosons ) can not grow in complexity or organize themselves as the number of particles increases , because @xmath106 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "the case of atoms is different , as discussed above .",
    "the question is open whether those systems can show self - organization ( organized complexity ) , when they form more complicated structures . at the moment",
    ", our indicative result is that for atoms complexity increases with the atomic number .",
    "this is interesting and promising for future research , because nature employs atoms as the basic building blocks of molecules and macromolecules related to biology .",
    "the next step is obviously to change their environment by influencing them by an external factor . in @xcite",
    "it was found that increasing the magnetic field applied on excited electrons of atoms , the information content of electrons in specific states is exchanged , while there is simultaneously an energy level avoided crossing of the corresponding states .",
    "an other idea is to study the effect of confinement @xcite , simulating , in a way , the effect of the _",
    "environment_.    the most obvious objection to sdl and lmc measures of complexity @xmath9 and @xmath8 respectively , is that any function of @xmath23 e.g. @xmath107 , @xmath108 does not give anything new , compared with @xmath23 .",
    "it is still a function of @xmath23 .",
    "this might be true for some cases , but in our specific treatment of quantum many - body systems with @xmath3 particles , the function @xmath79 is different than @xmath78 , providing a non - trivial dependence of @xmath109 on @xmath3 .",
    "it is seen from table [ tab : table ] that for bosonic systems @xmath4 is very large and @xmath5 very small , @xmath110 , which implies that they are _ disordered _ , as expected intuitively , because of the absence of the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "atoms can be considered as _ ordered _ @xmath111 .",
    "this seems reasonable and might be expected for a system created by filling with electrons , one by one , well defined orbitals in the coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "complexity measures are oscillating hard in atoms , but our experience leads us to the realization that the proper way to assess complexity is to define the overall trend by observing the closed shells atoms .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn for atoms in @xcite and recently in @xcite , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 , obtained with discrete ( fractional ) occupation probabilities of atomic orbitals , indicating an ordered system . in the same spirit ,",
    "nuclei and atomic clusters are ( less ) _ disordered _ systems @xmath114 lying between atoms and bosons .",
    "thus , a character of order or disorder can be assigned to each system .    in other words ,",
    "a well specified podi categorization emerges naturally .",
    "specifically , the inequality @xmath115 implies a character of _ disorder _ , while if @xmath87 the system has the character of _ order _ and there is the possibility of gradual change of their character from order to disorder realized in the chain atoms - atomic clusters - nuclei - bosons ( from left to right ) , or equivalently from top to bottom in table [ tab : table ] .",
    "it is seen in fig.[fig : abtotal ] that nuclei and bosons lie very close to the @xmath4-axis ( disorder ) , atoms on the @xmath5-axis ( order ) , while for atomic clusters the disorder character is much stronger than that of order .",
    "the proper values of @xmath7 are obtained by an overall fitting of @xmath2 with two free parameters to a single curve @xmath0 ( no free parameters ) .",
    "hence our statement that a quantum system is ordered or disordered comes from an overall comparison of the corresponding values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , i.e. for a range of values of @xmath3 .",
    "this enables us to find the optimal pair @xmath7 .",
    "if one wishes to obtain values @xmath7 imposing the condition @xmath6 , for a fixed value of @xmath3 , then one has to fit a two parameter formula @xmath2 to just a single value @xmath0 , obtaining a dependence @xmath116 .",
    "we also observe that for all systems studied in this work the functional of disequilibrium @xmath80 is very similar to @xmath10 and @xmath0 .",
    "the same observation was made in @xcite .",
    "thus a new measure of complexity emerges .",
    "the usefulness of our approach may be validated pragmatically , by future applications of podi to several other quantum and classical systems .",
    "first , it should give reasonable results appealing to intuition .",
    "second and more important , it is interesting to investigate cases where , instead of varying just the number of particles @xmath3 , one might study the effect on complexity of other relevant quantities of the systems as well .",
    "for example , the next step may be to study explicitly the effect of correlations between particles and/or the influence of various theoretical models of the systems .",
    "it is noted that so far there is no single or perfect quantitative definition of complexity .",
    "it is quite natural that any effort to provide a specific definition will be met with criticism @xcite .",
    "comments on the validity of sdl and lmc measures can be found in sec .",
    "4 of @xcite , where welcome properties of any definition of complexity are described in detail .",
    "an answer to the question whether complexity shows an increasing or decreasing trend with @xmath3 , is dictated by the behavior of @xmath0 .",
    "it is seen , that , at least for the models employed in the present paper , the trend of complexity is clearly decreasing for atomic clusters , nuclei and bosons , while it is increasing for atoms .",
    "an additional merit of the present work is the proper choice of the strength of disorder parameter @xmath4 and the strength of order @xmath5 , by imposing the approximate condition @xmath117 for all values of @xmath3 .",
    "this is in accordance with a relativistic treatment of atoms , where @xmath0 shows an increasing behavior as well @xcite .",
    "however , in our opinion , the latter result is not conclusive , because the corresponding studies are taking into account only the density distribution in position - space @xmath15 .",
    "a proper , complete treatment of information entropy @xmath23 and disequilibrium @xmath41 should take into account both position- and momentum - spaces , indicated by relations @xmath68 and @xmath118 , employed in our present calculations .",
    "so far , @xmath7 indices have been found for quantum systems .",
    "the same podi procedure can be applied to quantify order versus disorder in classical systems , provided that they can be treated probabilistically .",
    "such an application might be the use of probability densities in chaotic mappings , enabling researchers to quantify and observe the change of strengths of disorder @xmath4 and order @xmath5 , while non - linear systems evolve through various phases of chaotic behavior and routes to chaos .",
    "finally , one may , in principle associate to any probability distribution depending at least on one or more parameters describing a system , a podi pair and a corresponding complexity character , under certain conditions .",
    "this case can be examined in a future work .",
    "the present study focuses on the dependence of complexity on just one parameter , i.e. the number of particles .",
    "the same method might be extended to assess the effect of other relevant quantities , which are of interest in the context of a specific level of description of a system .",
    "another point , related to the latter one , is that in order to answer a specific question about organized complexity and the interplay of order versus disorder , one might need a sophisticated model of the dynamics of the system , or , in some cases , a simplified one , describing only salient but necessary features .",
    "this might be sufficient for a special aim . from this point of view",
    ", the merit of a model describing a system will be assessed , not only by its ability to reproduce exactly experimental results or simulate its behavior accurately , but by being robust enough to uncertainties or errors in description .",
    "this is facilitated by the fact that an inequality between @xmath119 can be satisfied for a wider range of values , instead of an approximate equality @xmath120 .    in brief",
    ", we propose a recipe to find a pair of order - disorder indices @xmath7 ( podi ) in order to classify the order versus disorder contribution to complexity of any system ( in our case quantum ) described probabilistically .",
    "this enables us to assign to systems the category of order ( @xmath87 ) or disorder ( @xmath121 ) and classify them accordingly .",
    "we conclude that the atom is the only system out of four , studied here , which is _ ordered and growing in complexity with the number of particles ( electrons ) .",
    "_ we conjecture that this is an information - theoretic explanation , supporting the fact that atoms are used by nature , as suitable components to construct larger structures i.e. molecules and macromolecules .",
    "it is also a first step , with encouraging results , to fulfill quantitatively wheeler s plan as the fundamental theory of the cosmos ."
