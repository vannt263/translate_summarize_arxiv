    "there should be a constant flow of pulsars in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane from the region where they are born to the region where they die .",
    "this flow is referred to as the pulsar current @xcite , which is defined as the integral over @xmath2 of @xmath8 . in a standard model @xcite ,",
    "all pulsars are thought to be born in supernovae with short initial periods .",

    "the formal basis for the pulsar current technique can be understood in terms of an analogy between the evolution of pulsars and the evolution of a one dimensional ( 1d ) dynamical system @xcite .",
    "the period , @xmath0 , plays the role of a generalized coordinate , and the period derivative , @xmath16 , plays the role of a generalized velocity",
    ". the evolution of pulsars may be described by a force law , which can be written as @xmath17 , and the solution of this equation gives the trajectory ( the path of an individual pulsar in the @xmath0@xmath16 plane ) , which depends on the specific function @xmath18 , and on an arbitrary constant of integration that can be different for different pulsars .",
    "some examples were given by @xcite .",
    "here we choose a widely favoured ( `` constant-@xmath5 '' ) model , in which pulsars are assumed to evolve such that they have a constant braking index , @xmath5 , to illustrate our arguments .",
    "the conventional interpretation of the pulsar current relies on two assumptions .",
    "one assumption is that all pulsars evolve according to the same law , and that this law depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "the requirement that the evolution depend only on @xmath0 and @xmath16 implies that it must not depend on any additional pulsar variable , such as a changing magnetic field , @xmath19 , or a changing angle , @xmath20 , between the rotation and magnetic axes .",
    "this requires that pulsars with the same @xmath0 and @xmath16 must have the same @xmath21 and the same @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption seems inconsistent with glitching , involving discontinuous changes in @xmath16 , and other non - systematic changes observed in pulsar timing .",
    "the second assumption relates to the interpretation of @xmath0@xmath16 space as a phase space , which underlies the concept of a current in this space .",
    "this assumption is satisfied only for specific classes of force laws , which includes all `` potential '' force laws , in which the force @xmath18 does not depend on @xmath16 .",
    "this assumption is violated for the constant-@xmath5 model .",
    "this inconsistency can be corrected by introducing a pseudo source term , that mimics births or deaths , but actually corresponds to convergence or divergence of trajectories , due to the wrong phase space being used . in this sense , the interpretation of the pulsar current is definitely not model free : for the constant-@xmath5 model one needs to include the pseudo source term that depends on @xmath5 .",
    "one of our objectives in this paper is to show how this pseudo source term affects the interpretation of a specific set of pulsar data .    despite these seemingly serious and perhaps fatal flaws",
    ", it is generally accepted that the pulsar current analysis leads to results for pulsar birthrates that are not inconsistent with other data , suggesting that the pulsar current approach is rather robust .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that there is an average universal law for pulsar evolution , on which glitching and other random changes is superimposed .",
    "assuming there is a universal evolution law , its form is not known .",
    "a constant-@xmath5 model is one of many different models that one can choose , and it has the unsatisfactory feature that it requires one to introduce the pseudo source term .",
    "there are other choices , including `` potential '' models , for which this complication does not occur .",
    "this leads to an obviously unsatisfactory situation in that the interpretation of the pulsar current seems to depend on an almost arbitrary assumption concerning the mathematical form of a putative evolution law . after demonstrating the complications that a constant-@xmath5 law introduces",
    ", we argue that it should be abandoned .",
    "if there is an ( average ) evolution law for pulsars , the simplest assumption one can make about this law is that it has a potential form .    in section  [",
    "sect : kinetic ] the kinetic equation for the pulsar distribution is defined and discussed , and the pseudo source term is identified for a general class of evolution laws . in section  [",
    "sect : data ] we show how the inclusion of the pseudo source term affects results on the birthrate derived from a statistical analysis of pulsar data . in section  [",
    "sect : alternative ] we discuss existing mathematical models for the evolution , we extend the formal theory by introducing a lagrangian formalism , and we carry out an analysis for a general form that includes both the constant-@xmath5 and potential laws as special cases .",

    "the distribution function for pulsars ( number per unit area of the @xmath0@xmath2 plane ) , @xmath22 , regarded as a function of the variables @xmath0 , @xmath2 , obeys a kinetic equation obtained by differentiating with respect to time .",
    "however , the resulting kinetic equation is not in the form ( similar to liouville s equation in statistical mechanics ) that underlies the interpretation of the pulsar current . in this section",
    "we show that two forms of the kinetic equation differ by a pseudo source term .",
    "it was argued by @xcite that the motion of the observable pulsars in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) can be interpreted as a `` fluid '' flow , where the fluid density corresponds to the density , @xmath22 , of pulsars in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane .",
    "specifically , @xmath23 pulsars with @xmath0 between @xmath0 and @xmath24 , and with @xmath2 between @xmath2 and @xmath25 .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath22 with time is due to evolution of individual pulsars and to birth and death of pulsars .",
    "these are described by the three terms in @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the rates , per unit time and per unit area of the @xmath0@xmath2 plane , that pulsars are born and die , respectively .    according to the rules of partial differentiation ,",
    "the time derivative of @xmath29 on the left hand side of ( [ bmd ] ) is given by @xmath30 we are interested in a steady - state distribution of pulsars , @xmath31 , in which evolution and the birth and death rates are in balance .",
    "the flow of pulsars through a vertical line in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane is interpreted as the pulsar current .",
    "the pulsar current is conventionally identified based on the kinetic equation @xmath32}{\\partial p } + \\frac{\\partial[{\\ddot p } n_p(p,{\\dot p})]}{\\partial { \\dot p } } = s_b(p,{\\dot p})-s_d(p,{\\dot p } ) .",
    "\\label{kinetic2}\\ ] ] on integrating ( [ kinetic2 ] ) over @xmath16 , the integral over the term involving the @xmath2-derivate is assumed to integrate to zero .",
    "the integral over @xmath2 of @xmath33 is interpreted as the pulsar current .",
    "( @xmath34 is often referred to as the pulsar current , but it is actually the current density in a localized range of @xmath2 . ) the integral over @xmath2 of @xmath35 then expresses conservation of pulsars .",
    "this allows one to infer properties of the source term , @xmath27 describing birth of pulsars , and the sink term , @xmath28 describing death of pulsars , from the statistical distribution of pulsars on the @xmath0@xmath2 plane .",
    "the kinetic equation ( [ kinetic2 ] ) differs from that obtained by combining ( [ kinetic1 ] ) and ( [ bmd ] ) in that the factors @xmath16 and @xmath21 are inside the respective derivatives . to derive ( [ kinetic2 ] ) from ( [ kinetic1 ] )",
    "one needs to move @xmath16 and @xmath21 inside the respective derivatives . assuming that @xmath0 and @xmath16 are the independent variables , which is implicit in the use of the @xmath0@xmath2 plane , the first of these is trivial . for the evolution law @xmath17 assumed by @xcite ,",
    "the second introduces an extra term , which we move to the right hand side and interpret as a pseudo source term , @xmath36 the right hand side of ( [ kinetic3 ] ) is then replaced by @xmath37 . in order to interpret information on the birthrate of pulsars from statistical data , one needs to calculate the additional term ( [ pseudo ] ) .",
    "we discuss the effect of this term on the interpretation of the pulsar current for evolution at fixed @xmath5 in the next section .",
    "we then argue that there is little evidence for the actual form of the pulsar evolution equation , that any model involves an ad hoc assumption , and that a sensible criterion to adopt in choosing an evolution equation is that the pseudo force term is absent .",
    "the effect of the pseudo source term on the interpretation of the pulsar current is explored in this section for the widely favoured model of evolution at fixed @xmath5 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath38 in ( [ pseudo ] ) .",
    "the main qualitative point we make is that the use of the pulsar current is model - dependent , with the explicit dependence on the model appearing through the pseudo - source term .",
    "we revisited our standard pulsar current analysis @xcite by including the pseudo - source term in our calculation . in the following analysis we used 1438 non - recycled pulsars that were predominantly discovered by the parkes pulsar surveys ,",
    "of which all are obtained from public pulsar catalogue at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/pulsar/psrcat .",
    "we accurately modelled the sensitivity threshold of the multibeam survey and use this model to compute the pulsar birthrate . to simulate the uncertainties in the data , rather than choosing a fixed braking index , we chose @xmath5 randomly distributed about a mean , ranging from 1 to 5 , and then calculated the pulsar current , with the same radio luminosity threshold , galactic electron density and beaming models as for the conventional pulsar current approach @xcite , figure  [ fig2 ] . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we plot the standard pulsar current together with two revisited pulsar currents , denoting their corresponding pulsar birthrates .",
    "there are substantial differences in currents corresponding to different values in @xmath5 . for @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath40 is negative , which reduces the pulsar current , implying that the neglect of the pseudo source term leads to an overestimate of the current . for @xmath41 , @xmath40 is positive , implying that the neglect of the pseudo source term leads to an underestimate of the current .",
    "our simulations for different runs of braking index are shown on figures  [ fig4 ]  a ) , b ) & c ) .",
    "each plot displays two histograms , the revisited pulsar current on the left , and its corresponding histogram of randomly chosen braking indices on the right . matching birthrate and average braking index with its standard deviation",
    "are displayed on each histogram .",
    "the effect of the assumed value of @xmath5 on the estimated birthrate for given data can be seen from the plots : @xmath41 ( @xmath39 ) the inferred birthrate is higher ( lower ) than when the pseudo source term is neglected .",
    "@xcite and @xcite reported braking index measurements for six young pulsars ( crab , b0540 - 69 , vela , j1119 - 6127 , b1509 - 58 , and j1846 - 0258 ) .",
    "five have an unambiguous measurements of @xmath5 , via phase - coherent timing , and these are marked by a star in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we show their implied trajectories in the @xmath0@xmath2 plane by arrows in figure  [ fig1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there are only a few pulsars that are potential candidates for accurate measurement of @xmath5 , which requires that they satisfy the following .",
    "firstly they must spin down sufficiently quickly to allow a useful measurement of @xmath42 .",
    "secondly , the position of the pulsar should be accurately known at the @xmath431 arcsecond level .",
    "thirdly , the spin - down must not be seriously affected by glitches , sudden spin - ups of the pulsar , or timing noise .",
    "typically , glitches begin to seriously affect smooth spin down at characteristic ages of @xmath44kyr @xcite .",
    "thus many of the pulsars that may spin down fast enough for a measurement of @xmath5 are irretrievably contaminated by glitches @xcite .",
    "timing noise varies from object to object , is roughly correlated with spin - down rate @xcite and can prevent a measurement of @xmath5 in a finite data set in an unpredictable way .",
    "all six trajectories have @xmath45 , three of them have upward slopes ( @xmath41 ) , and none of them is directed towards the main body of pulsars .",

    "for the pulsar current to be a well - defined concept , there must be a universal law of the form @xmath17 obeyed by all pulsars .",
    "this is clearly not the case . for the pulsar current to be a useful concept ,",
    "such an evolution law must apply at least in some average sense for all pulsars .",
    "the constant-@xmath5 evolution law assumed in the previous section , although widely favoured , is essentially ad hoc . in this section",
    "we introduce a general ( lagrangian ) formalism , that assumes that there is a unique evolution law but makes no assumptions on its form .",
    "we use this formalism to identify a simpler class of evolution models that we refer to as potential models .      before introducing a general theory for a possible pulsar evolution model ,",
    "we summarize the models that underlie the discussion in the previous section .",
    "the vacuum dipole model has a contradictory status in pulsar physics .",
    "one the one hand , it is the basis of our interpretation of pulsars , notably @xmath46 , and it is the only model for which the evolution is well determined . on the other hand ,",
    "the model is clearly inapplicable to actual pulsars , and the actual evolution is inconsistent with observations .",
    "the constant @xmath47 model is often assumed to describe evolution in the vacuum dipole , but this is incorrect .",
    "the model is that a ( structureless , point ) rotating magnetic dipole in vacuo radiates electromagnetic radiation that escapes to infinity , carrying off energy and angular momentum .",
    "the loss of energy causes @xmath0 to increase on a characteristic spin - down timescale , and the torque causes @xmath48 to decrease , implying that the rotation and magnetic axes tend to align on the spin - down time scale @xcite .",
    "the braking index is @xmath49 @xcite , which is always greater than 3 , and which increases as @xmath48 decreases .",
    "this vacuum - dipole model , at least in its simplest form , is unacceptable for pulsars .",
    "the putative electromagnetic radiation has a frequency equal to the rotation frequency of the pulsar , well below the plasma frequency in the pulsar wind and in the ism , and it can not escape to infinity , as the model requires .",
    "the model predicts that the magnetic and rotation axes align on the spin - down time scale .",
    "there is a theoretical argument that the structure of the star may slow the alignment @xcite , and there is evidence for older pulsars having smaller of values of @xmath48 @xcite , but the prediction of the model itself is inconsistent with pulsar data .",
    "the constant @xmath47 model is often confused with the vacuum dipole model . in the @xmath47 model , it is assumed that the evolution of pulsars is at constant @xmath50 , and this is combined with the vacuum dipole model so that the assumption becomes evolution at constant @xmath51 .",
    "note that this is inconsistent with the actual vacuum dipole model , which implies systematically decreasing @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the basic assumption in the constant @xmath47 model is that the trajectory of pulsars in the @xmath0@xmath2 is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "the force law implied by this relation is @xmath53 and this implies a braking index @xmath54 equal to 3 .",
    "although a vacuum model modified by assuming @xmath50 remains constant is widely favoured it is not supported by any detailed theory for the evolution .",
    "another model that is used widely is based on the assumption that the braking index is constant but not necessarily equal to 3 ; we refer to this as the @xmath55 constant model . according to ( [ braking ] ) ,",
    "@xmath55 constant implies @xmath56 , and integrating this equation leads to the trajectory @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a constant .",
    "this is the model used for illustrative purposes in the previous section .",
    "however , the assumption @xmath55 constant on which it is based is also not supported by any detailed theory for the evolution , and should be regarded as ad hoc .",
    "granted that one needs to make an ad hoc assumption in choosing a possible universal law governing pulsar evolution in @xmath0@xmath2 , it is desirable to choose a law that does not introduce unnecessary complications .",
    "as shown in detail above , the @xmath55 constant model leads to the need to include a pseudo source term in the interpretation of the pulsar current . a model that avoids this complication is one in which @xmath21 depends only on @xmath0 .",
    "we refer to this as a potential model .",
    "the law is written in the form @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the potential in the theory developed below .",
    "this theory is also not supported by any detailed theory for the evolution , and is also ad hoc . however",
    ", a potential model has the advantage of being the simplest model , and the best justification for it is that one should explored the simplest model first .      in a lagrangian formulation of dynamics",
    "the independent variables are the generalized coordinates and generalized velocities . in the present case ,",
    "the generalized coordinate is identified as @xmath0 and the generalized velocity as @xmath16 .",
    "a lagrangian , @xmath59 may be identified by requiring that the euler - lagrange equation @xmath60 reproduce the equation of motion .",
    "consider the evolution law @xcite @xmath61 this has a lagrangian counterpart for @xmath62 .",
    "the relevant lagrangian is a particular case of @xmath63 for which ( [ euler ] ) implies @xmath64 where the prime denotes a derivative in @xmath0 .",

    "there is no pseudo source term in the kinetic equation for a lagrangian of the form ( [ lagrangian1 ] ) with @xmath73 .",
    "the generalized momentum , @xmath74 , is then equal to the generalized velocity , so that the @xmath0@xmath16 is a phase space in the sense required for liouville s theorem to apply . in this case ( [ lagrangian2 ] ) gives @xmath75 and ( [ lagrangian3 ] ) , ( [ lagrangian4 ] ) apply with @xmath73 .",

    "@xmath3 this constant is @xmath4 , and for the potential law ( [ lagrangian3 ] ) , the constant is @xmath69 . for any given law , the constant of integration",
    "is determined for a particular pulsar by the values of @xmath0 and @xmath2 at birth , and the subsequent evolution is determined by ( [ lagrangian3 ] ) with @xmath69 fixed , but different for different pulsars .",
    "the theory for the pulsar current is based on the assumption that there is a universal evolution law for pulsars , and that it depends only on @xmath0 and @xmath16 .",
    "this requirement is not satisfied , with glitching and other random changes implying that the trajectory of at least some pulsars on the @xmath0@xmath16 plane is influenced by other effects .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that the evolution of all pulsars does follow a universal law in some average sense , and this would suffice to justify the pulsar current technique .",
    "assuming there is an average universal evolution law that applies to all pulsar , it is clear that we have little information on what this law is .",
    "a constant-@xmath5 law has been used widely in the literature .",
