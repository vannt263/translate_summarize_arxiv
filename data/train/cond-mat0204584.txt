    "it is generally acknowledged that a specific choice of @xmath6 above is immaterial in the thermodynamic limit @xcite , for therein these expressions differ by terms increasingly small , but in the opposite limit of only a few degrees of freedom they lead to appreciably different observables , most notably the equilibrium temperature ( given by the thermodynamic relation @xmath17 ) @xcite .",

    "this fact is confirmed by bmwg through numerical simulations of a particle coupled to a chain of oscillators , in which the authors measure the average of twice the kinetic energy of the particle and compare it with the predicted value from their proposed temperature expression .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that an implicit assumption in the work of bmwg is the coincidence of their analytic temperature definition @xmath20 [ eq .",
    "( [ bmwg - temp ] ) ] with @xmath22 ( twice the average kinetic energy , where we temporarily set the mass and the boltzmann constant to unity ) , i.e. it is assumed that their temperature definition coincides with , or at least approximates the familiar equipartition one .",
    "since it was actually the latter quantity that was used to assess the quality of the former and not the other way around , one can say that the endeavor of bmwg was to find a dynamical method for evaluating @xmath22 in terms of the phase space structure of the system , and that the failure of eq .",

( [ vol - temp ] ) ] for any system size , establishing incidentally the equivalence between the equipartition and the volume temperatures .",

    "( [ bp - area ] ) is indeed inappropriate to predict the equipartition temperature of small systems @xcite , but also that the dynamical corrections to @xmath25 suggested in the work of ref .",
    "@xcite are unnecessary , since an alternate and equally legitimate form of the boltzmann principle [ eq .",
    "( [ bp - vol ] ) ] is sufficient for that purpose .",
    "this observation translates immediately into a negative answer to the question posed in the title of the present work , so long as one answers it in the context of the work of bmwg .",
    "the remaining of this paper is organized as follows . after reviewing the formalism of bmwg ( sec .",
    "[ fp - review ] ) , it will be shown that the temperature expression found in ref .",
    "@xcite is an approximation to the usual one defined through the equipartition theorem , and hence that the expression derived therein as a generalization of the boltzmann principle is but a particular approximation to the volume entropy ( sec .",
    "[ fp - connection ] ) . these findings will be illustrated by means of a hamiltonian model similar to that of bmwg ( sec .",
    "[ model ] ) , where in addition the distribution of momenta is computed and seen to depart from the canonical one .",
    "this provides , in turn , an alternate means of explaining the inability of the area temperature to predict the average of twice the kinetic energy of a particle , as seen in the numerical experiments of bianucci _",
    "in order to understand the origin of the dynamical generalization of the boltzmann principle mentioned above , it is worth reviewing the scope and results of bmwg . the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were concerned with problems whose degrees of freedom can be separated into `` system of interest '' and `` irrelevant , '' the latter playing the role of what is commonly known as heat bath or thermostat in the literature . however , in order to avoid confusion with the usual fokker - planck equation approach to their problem , in which the irrelevant degrees of freedom are assumed to be in a specific macroscopic state ( usually a canonical one , see e.g. @xcite ) , the word _ booster _ was adopted instead .",
    "therefore , the general goal of bmwg was to derive the thermostatistical properties of a system coupled to a ( finite or infinite ) bath whose thermal properties arise naturally from dynamics , bridging the gap between mechanics and thermodynamics much like the ideas of boltzmann .    notwithstanding",
    "the avoidance of macroscopic assumptions , two fundamental properties concerning the dynamics of the booster had to be assumed in order to make the problem amenable to their analytical approach , namely ( i ) it is chaotic enough so that its correlation functions decay in a finite time ( _ finite correlation time _ ) and ( ii ) the average response of the system to an external perturbation is linear ( _ linear response _ ) .",
    "in addition , the system of interest was taken to be a single particle with coordinates @xmath26 linearly coupled to the booster via a `` doorway '' variable @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 can be interpreted as an external force driving the particle ( or , vice versa , @xmath29 for the booster ) whose coupling strength @xmath30 has to be sufficiently small to justify their perturbative approach ( _ weak coupling _",
    "condition ) . condition ( i ) implies in particular that the unperturbed autocorrelation function of the doorway variable ( with @xmath31 indicating an equilibrium average in the absence of coupling ) , viz .",
    "@xmath32 vanishes for finite @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) , which in turn implies that the correlation time @xmath35 is finite .",
    "condition ( ii ) states that the average behavior of the doorway variable after the introduction of an external time - dependent perturbation @xmath36 to its equation of motion can be written as the following convolution ( recall the assumption @xmath34 above ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a function that dictates how the average of @xmath27 responds to the small perturbation @xmath36 ( response function ) .",
    "together with ( i ) , condition ( ii ) furnishes two other finite quantities , the asymptotic susceptibility @xmath39 and the response time @xmath40 where the convenient variable @xmath41 was introduced so that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    relying on the above assumptions ( and also on a few others concerning the separation of time - scales ) and equipped with a specific projection technique , bianucci and his collaborators embarked on the rather remarkable endeavor of `` integrating out '' the irrelevant degrees of freedom of the booster without the precise knowledge of its hamiltonian structure , ultimately in the search of a differential equation governing the time evolution of the reduced distribution function of the particle , which can be formally written as @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the distribution function of all the dynamical variables and @xmath46 denotes the remaining degrees of freedom of the booster . the resulting differential equation , eq . ( 47 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , is then identified with a general 2d fokker - planck equation of the type @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the effective time evolution operator ( liouvillian ) of the unperturbed particle . from a comparison between the coefficients of their equation and the structure of the above equation , they suggest ( despite the implicit dependence on the particle",

    "the subscript in @xmath20 stands for bmwg . to render the above equation independent of @xmath26 , bmwg consider the following three cases : ( a ) the particle is a harmonic oscillator with @xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath52 , and ( c ) a `` natural time scale '' ( nts ) condition exists separating the typical timescale of the system of interest from the relaxation ts of the booster ( the former being much greater than the latter ) . under condition ( a )",

    "<S> its exact form , however , is strictly related to the `` volume '' entropy @xmath3 via the thermodynamic relation above for systems of any number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath4 is the phase space volume enclosed by the constant - energy surface ) . this observation explains and clarifies the numerical results of bianucci et al . and shows that a dynamical correction for either the temperature or the entropy is unnecessary , at least within the class of systems considered by those authors . </S>",
    "<S> explicit analytical and numerical results for a particle coupled to a small chain ( @xmath5 ) of quartic oscillators are also provided to further illustrate these facts . </S>"
