    "they adopted a mosaic strategy consisting of 28 total pointings , with the seven pointings centered on the cdf - s ( and hence the southern goods field ) receiving deeper integrations and being somewhat more tightly spaced than the remainder of the mosaic .",

    "interestingly , the 24@xmath1 m _ spitzer _ data suggested that over half of the radio / x - ray agn exhibited evidence for concurrent star formation but that contrary to prior results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a set of four pointings at 4.86  ghz yielded about the same sensitivity and resolution , thereby providing spectral index information for many of the 266 sources detected at 1.4  ghz .",

    "* ) , they evaluated the composition of the fainter radio sources responsible for the flattening of the euclidean normalized radio source counts below about 300 @xmath1jy .",
    "although sources powered by star formation become greater contributers to the source counts at these levels , agn continue to be an important population .",
    "the x - ray spectral properties of the radio sources will be discussed in tozzi et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    however , each program has some limitations .",
    "the atca survey is hampered by its lower resolution ; for a source at @xmath9 , 1 equals 8 kpc ( for @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 = 0.3 , @xmath13 ) and hence the atca beam is about 135 kpc @xmath0 55 kpc .",
    "a 5@xmath14-detected radio source at this redshift would have a rest - frame @xmath15 w hz@xmath11 , assuming a spectral index of 0.7 ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "locally , this 1.4  ghz luminosity corresponds to only the brightest radio - emitting galaxies , the vast majority of which are powerful agn with radio jets and lobes ( e.g. , see the rlf of * ? ? ?",
    "the k2008 vla survey has very good resolution ( about 28 kpc at @xmath9 ) and is about twice as sensitive , but because it was performed using a single pointing its sensitivity declines radially from the cdf - s center .",
    "this means that outside the formal cdf - s area the atca survey is more sensitive .",
    "we report here on a new vla program that provides deep , high resolution 1.4  ghz imaging across the full e - cdf - s . recognizing the importance of this field to the astronomical community and the rapid rate at which new multiwavelength data are becoming available",
    ", we are following a tiered approach to the release of the data . in this paper",
    "we present the first data release , consisting of the survey description , methods , and a best `` first pass '' image and catalog .",
    "this covers a @xmath17 region including the full e - cdf - s at a typical rms sensitivity of 8 @xmath1jy per 28@xmath016 beam .",
    "we anticipate that with more refined imaging techniques the survey will ultimately achieve an rms sensitivity of around 7 @xmath1jy per beam",
    ". a second data release consisting of these improved images and a more complete catalog is intended for release in january 2009 .",
    "the end goal of 7 @xmath1jy rms sensitivity was determined based on the existing and soon - to - be completed multiwavelength surveys .",
    "the prior radio surveys indicate that this sensitivity will yield 3@xmath14 or greater detections of the majority of the 762 x - ray sources in the @xcite e - cdf - s catalog .",
    "in addition , a new _ spitzer _ legacy survey ( `` fidel , '' for far - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ) will produce the deepest 70@xmath1 m images obtained by _ spitzer _ ( 0.5 mjy rms ) across nearly the entire e - cdf - s coverage area . the target rms sensitivity of 7 @xmath1jy at 1.4  ghz for the vla data is a direct match to the fidel sensitivity for a @xmath9 star - forming galaxy should it lie on the locally - observed fir - radio correlation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "based on the extrapolation of an existing 70@xmath1 m program reaching the depth of fidel @xcite , about 100 star - forming galaxies with @xmath18 should be detected by fidel .",
    "should the fir - radio correlation hold at such redshifts , nearly all should be detected by these new radio observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - observations ]",
    "we detail the observational strategy and schedule .",
    "the data reduction is described in section [ sec - reductions ] , and the initial source catalog in section [ sec - catalog ] .",
    "each of these sections notes some of the considerations that should be kept in mind for users of the data in this first release .",
    "section [ sec - future ] provides a summary of the improvements that are planned for the second data release , and we summarize the key points of the current release in section [ sec - summary ] .",
    "the primary beam of the vla is about 31 full - width at half maximum , and smearing effects due to the observational bandwidth and integration time decrease this further .",
    "it is therefore impossible to provide near - uniform sensitivity across the full @xmath19 area of the e - cdf - s through a single pointing .",
    "we consequently adopted the standard practice of observing a hexagonal ring of six pointings with each one spaced 12 from its nearest neighbor .",
    "the center of the ring was the approximate center of the e - cdf - s , taken to be ( j2000 ) 3@xmath2032@xmath21280 @xmath2227@xmath2348300 .",
    "this is the field center used for the k2008 observations , but was not the field center for a pointing in the current program .",
    "however , because it is well within the half - power point of each of the six individual pointings it still corresponds to the most sensitive region of the final image .",
    "the coordinates for each of the six pointings are included in table [ tbl - obs ] and depicted in figures [ fig - msc ] and [ fig - rms ] .",
    "wide - field imaging with the vla at 1.4  ghz is subject to several challenges , which may generally be attributed to the large size of the primary beam and the high density of sources at 1.4  ghz .",
    "sources distant from the field center are distorted due to the observed bandwidth , causing them to smear in the radial direction .",
    "this limits the sensitivity of an image even at the field center , since more distant sources and their sidelobes are smeared and hence not easily cleaned .",
    "the problem is usually circumvented by dividing the full bandwidth into multiple smaller - sized channels , each of which may be imaged individually and then averaged . for 1.4  ghz observations with the vla this requires an exchange of the usual 50  mhz continuum band for a 25  mhz band which can be further divided into channels .",
    "the loss of net bandwidth reduces the sensitivity at the field center , but for deep observations this loss is more than offset by the reduced bandwidth smearing and hence better sensitivity distant from the field center .",
    "thus , the e - cdf - s observations were performed in this mode , consisting of seven 3.125  mhz channels at each of two center frequencies , 1.365  ghz and 1.435  ghz . left and right circular polarizations were collected for each set , resulting in a total of 28 channels .",
    "the 3.125  mhz channels limit the bandwidth smearing for an individual pointing to an amount approximately equal to the resolution for sources 15 from the field center of that pointing .",
    "however , with the current vla correlator limitations the use of channels a factor of two narrower would also decrease the net bandwidth by a factor of two .",
    "the program was awarded 240 hours of time as a result of the nrao `` large '' proposal solicitation .",
    "the program code , useful for obtaining the raw data through the vla archive , is am889 .",
    "the e - cdf - s is observable by the vla for only about seven hours a day on account of its southern declination , and this is compounded by the vla s increasing system temperature at 1.4  ghz as the elevation of the target decreases .",
    "consequently , the observations were scheduled in 5-hour blocks centered at 3:30 lst , meaning the e - cdf - s was observed at elevations ranging from about 20 to 28 degrees .",
    "thus , 48 individual days of observation were required to obtain the net allotment of 240 hours .",
    "the program ran from 03 june 2007 through 23 september 2007 , with most of the observations occurring between the middle of july and early september ( see table [ tbl - obs ] ) . with the exception of the final observation date the array was in its largest configuration , the a array . due to some time lost due to unforeseen events ( e.g. , power outages at the vla site , minor glitches related to the transition to evla ) and rescheduled later",
    ", observations were actually scheduled on a total of 52 days .",
    "we elected to devote each individual observation date ( hereafter often referred to as a `` track '' ) to a single pointing of the six - pointing mosaic .",
    "the main reason for this was pragmatic , in that it lessens the complexity of the data reduction ( see below ) .",
    "however , it should also prove useful to future studies of possible time variability of faint radio sources since observing a single pointing per track implies that a reasonably deep limit ( @xmath24 @xmath1jy rms ) is achieved on eight separate occasions .",
    "we sequentially cycled through the pointings , meaning each one was observed roughly once every ten days .    the same calibrators and general observing sequence were followed for each track .",
    "flux calibration was achieved through observations of 3c48 , with phase and bandpass calibration provided by the source j0340 - 213 .",
    "this calibrator lies less than @xmath25 from the e - cdf - s and has a position known to an accuracy of better than 0.002 arcseconds from the vlba calibrator survey @xcite .",
    "we alternated scans of j0340 - 213 and the target pointing with a roughly half hour cycle interval , with approximate time on source of 2.5 and 26.5 minutes , respectively .",
    "3c48 was usually observed twice per track .",
    "the integration time per visibility was set at 3.3s in order to minimize the effect of time - averaging on the visibilities while keeping the data volume reasonable .",
    "a standard procedure was followed for each observing track .",
    "we used the 31dec07 version of aips , updated regularly throughout the observing program .",
    "the raw ( u , v ) data were loaded , including back end system temperatures to be used for data weighting . we elected to perform our own flagging of all data since",
    "the new vla online control software was known to occasionally flag good data and not all the system flags had been implemented yet for the antennas that had been retrofitted for the evla . the ( u , v ) data for j0340 - 213 were inspected and obvious time periods of bad data were removed ( for example , the beginnings of scans where the array was not yet on source ) .",
    "the use of multiple channels requires proper calibration of the individual bandpass responses , so the j0340 - 213 data were used for this purpose . because this source has some extended structure , this calibration only included baselines larger than 15 k@xmath26 .",
    "the derived bandpass calibration was then applied for subsequent data editing , beginning with 3c48 .",
    "whenever possible we used the scan of 3c48 made at elevations comparable to the e - cdf - s and j0340 - 213 for flux density calibration , ignoring the other scan which was made at higher elevation .",
    "the flux density of 3c48 was taken to be 16.38 jy and 15.75 jy at 1.365  ghz and 1.435  ghz , respectively , calculated according to @xcite .",
    "this flux density scale was bootstrapped to j0340 - 213 , which was then used to calibrate the gains and phases of the e - cdf - s data through linear interpolation .",
    "j0340 - 213 did appear to vary over the three months of observations , with its derived flux density declining steadily from about 1 jy in june to 0.9 jy in early august , then rising back to 1 jy over the next two weeks where it remained until the observations concluded in september .",
    "we typically applied the derived calibrations and inspected all the 3c48 and j0340 - 213 data again , compiling additional flags as necessary and regenerating the calibrations if necessary .",
    "once good calibration was achieved , the target e - cdf - s data were edited .",
    "the beginnings of each scan were removed , using the same duration found for the beginnings of the j0340 - 213 scans .",
    "obviously bad data , usually restricted to a single antenna for fixed time ranges , were excised . in most cases",
    "these were directly corroborated by the observing logs for that date and included explanations such as an antenna receiving standard maintenance or suffering a known mechanical problem .",
    "editing of the e - cdf - s data sometimes also included excision of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) , as discussed further below ( [ sec - challenges ] ) .",
    "the target e - cdf - s data for that date s pointing were then imaged using the aips imagr task .",
    "first , we used the data to create a very large ( @xmath27 across ) image at low resolution . upon this",
    "was overlaid a grid of 91 overlapping @xmath28 fields , arranged in a `` flys - eye '' pattern ( see figure [ fig - flyseye ] ; a central field , surrounded by a ring of six fields , with this ring surrounded by a second ring of 12 fields , on out to a fifth ring , in total approximating a 22 radius circle ) .",
    "this flys - eye represents the fields to be imaged at the full resolution of the data , meaning the large low - resolution map could be used to identify sources outside this area",
    ". typically about 25 such `` flanking '' sources were noted , and their positions from the nvss @xcite were used as the field centers for subsequent imaging .",
    "the resulting @xmath29 fields were then imaged using the multi - facet imaging capability of imagr .",
    "a pixel size of 05 was used , and each field ( facet ) in the flys - eye was @xmath30 pixels ( hence the @xmath28 fields in the flys - eye ) .",
    "the flanking fields were usually smaller , at 128 pixels @xmath0 128 pixels , sufficient to image the bright source and hence prevent its sidelobes from adversely effecting the sensitivity within the flys - eye facets .",
    "the use of multiple facets greatly alleviates image distortions due to sky curvature ( the `` 3d effect '' ) by shifting the ( u , v ) data for that facet to the tangent point at its center .",
    "imagr properly handles sources that are present in multiple facets , with the full flux density associated with a given coordinate being restored to each facet which includes that coordinate .",
    "after preliminary images of the facets were generated , we proceeded to box all identifiable sources .",
    "these boxes represent the allowable regions for imagr to search for sources to clean , thereby speeding subsequent imaging runs and more importantly preventing clean bias .",
    "our imaging did apply a slight gaussian taper to the ( u , v ) data along with a data weighting intermediate between pure uniform and pure natural weighting .",
    "this produced a well - behaved ( nearly gaussian ) synthesized beam of 28 @xmath0 16 having a position angle near zero ( i.e. , north - south ) .",
    "finally , several of the brightest sources within the flys - eye coverage were given their own small facets for subsequent imaging .",
    "this improves their cleaning in the same manner as noted for imaging multiple facets .    additional calibration and editing of the data",
    "were then performed . the images themselves can serve as the model input for further improvement of calibrated gains and phases , a procedure known as self calibration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this helps to remove residual phase variation caused by variation in the troposphere and ionosphere above the telescopes in the array .",
    "for the data corresponding to an individual day s observations we used a four - minute interval for the self - calibration and did not alter the amplitudes .",
    "the self - calibrated data were again imaged , and further minor edits were performed by subtracting the clean components of the resulting images from the self - calibrated ( u , v ) data and inspecting the results .",
    "after removing obviously discrepant data the clean components were returned to the edited file , producing a near - final calibrated data set for that day s observation .",
    "the vla is currently undergoing the transition to the expanded vla ( evla ) , with upgrades to the receivers , electronics , and data transmission systems .",
    "along with a new state - of - the - art correlator , due to be commissioned in 2009 , the evla will provide near continuous frequency coverage from 1 to 50  ghz and much greater observed bandwidths .",
    "these will yield a continuum sensitivity improvement ranging from about 5 to over 20 times the current vla . observing in the midst of this transition to evla",
    "did produce some additional challenges .",
    "the e - cdf - s observations consisted of 15 to 17 `` classic '' vla antennas and six to 11 that had been retrofitted into evla antennas .",
    "in general , the two antenna types performed similarly . more significant than the upgrade of antennas to evla compatible ones was the retirement of the original vla control computers which occurred on 27 june 2007 .",
    "slight errors in how the new online system calculated the ( u , v , w ) coordinates were found , and these errors lead to the distortion of sources .",
    "these errors have now been fixed for all the am889 data residing in the vla archive , but we adopted the standard procedure of running uvfix on all our data as a first step .",
    "this task calculates the ( u , v , w ) data using the antenna positions that are also included in the loaded raw data .",
    "any small residual phase errors resulting from minor errors in the antenna positions are then corrected during the self calibration steps .",
    "another system glitch reversed the channel indexing for brief periods on three of the observe dates ( august 23 , september 6 , and september 12 ) .",
    "we wrote a code using existing aips tasks to split out the data with reversed channel indexing , correct its channel order , then return it to the uneffected data . as with the ( u , v , w ) calculation errors , this problem has now been fixed for all am889 data in the vla archive .",
    "there was also a somewhat mysterious error that has since been attributed to the `` self - test '' procedure within the correlator .",
    "this was seen for all vla observations using a 25  mhz bandwidth , which was the case for the e - cdf - s observations .",
    "it amounts to offsets to the raw data corresponding to a given baseline and correlator , which result in ripples around the phase center of the imaged data .",
    "these correlator offsets were relatively constant over a five - hour track , although they did vary from day to day .",
    "thus , the aips task uvmth was used to time average the visibilities in each day s ( u , v ) data set and subtract the averages from the raw data  thus removing the offsets .",
    "the procedure works best when there are no strong sources near the phase center of the affected data , which fortunately was true for the six e - cdf - s pointings ( although the second pointing does have a bright source about 4 from the center ) .",
    "although calibration does affect the correlator offsets , their magnitude was usually small and the gain and phase stability of the observations was very good .",
    "this means that the correlator offsets present in the raw ( u , v ) data remain essentially constant in the calibrated data and hence can safely be removed after calibration .",
    "we thereby applied uvmth in the final steps associated with each individual day s data .",
    "first , we took the self - calibrated ( u , v ) data and subtracted the clean components obtained during the imaging of such data .",
    "this produced a ( u , v ) data set consisting predominantly of the thermal noise and any correlator offsets .",
    "uvmth was run on these data , after which the clean components were added back in to produce the final ( u , v ) data for that date .",
    "this procedure generally resulted in an improvement to the rms noise at the phase center of around 2 @xmath1jy .",
    "a final challenge that was surmounted involved the data weights .",
    "system temperature values for each antenna are included with the data , and the weight assigned any baseline is inversely proportional to the product of the system temperatures for the two antennas that compose that baseline .",
    "these weights are calibrated in the same steps that calibrate the data in general .",
    "the data for some of the more - recently retrofitted evla antennas ( antenna 19 in particular ) had incorrect system temperature values , which inadvertantly caused aips to overweight these antennas by a factor of three during calibration .",
    "this can effectively be thought of as a change in array geometry ( packing three antennas into one position in the array ) which propagates into the synthesized beam and hence imaging results .",
    "we manually adjusted these incorrect weights by the noted factor of three at the conclusion of our reductions for each observing date .",
    "aips has subsequently been patched to appropriately handle the incorrect system temperature values and hence produce more accurate calibrated data weights .    finally ,",
    "as indicated in the previous section some of the data were affected by rfi .",
    "when present , this was almost always confined to the higher frequency channels of our observations ( around 1450  mhz ) and restricted in duration to about one hour .",
    "furthermore , the timing of the onset of the rfi was near daybreak . when editing data we usually excised the highest frequency channels during the effected time range , and attempted to keep the remaining data .",
    "additional removal of data compromised by rfi occurred after imaging and self calibration during the step where clean components of imaged sources were removed and the resulting ( u , v)-subtracted data were edited .      once the data for each individual observation date had been satisfactorily calibrated and edited , they were combined",
    "all eight ( in some cases , 9 ) data sets corresponding to a given pointing had their times converted to hour angles , at which point they were concatenated and then averaged by baseline . for the september 23 data , which were obtained after the vla had moved into its bna configuration , we only included those antenna locations which were present for the preceding observations .",
    "the bna array has the same antenna configuration for its north arm as the a array , with the east and west arms moved to a more compact arrangement of antennas .",
    "thus , for the september 23 data only 17 antennas were used ( the nine for the north arm , with four from each the east and west arms ) .",
    "the resulting concatenated and baseline averaged data were then imaged as in the procedure for individual observing tracks . for this imaging , we repeated the step of making a large low - resolution image to identify flanking fields since the combined data were deeper and hence revealed additional outlying sources .",
    "we also expanded the flys - eye by an additional ring making it consist of 127 facets thus approximating a 30 radius circle and hence the full vla primary beam . in total , about 165 facets were imaged at the full resolution for each pointing .",
    "these images were inspected and sources boxed , with many additional sources being identified relative to the individual days data on account of the @xmath31 improvement in sensitivity .    a subsequent round of imaging at the full resolution , using the more complete listing of boxed sources , was then used as the input source model for a final self calibration . in this case , the self calibration adjusted both amplitude and phase .",
    "this is particularly useful when combining data collected on different days , as it puts the individual gains onto a common system .",
    "the self - calibrated data were then imaged to produce the final maps corresponding to that pointing in the mosaic .",
    "the rms noise in the central facet of each pointing ranged from about 10.3 to 11.1 @xmath1jy beam@xmath11 . in each case , the source - subtracted residual images were well approximated by a gaussian noise distribution with maxima and minima usually in the @xmath32 @xmath1jy range .",
    "slightly larger values did appear in facets containing the brighter sources .",
    "the six pointings were then stitched together using the aips task flatn to produce the final mosaic image that comprises the first data release .",
    "flatn properly weights the data by the inverse square of the primary beam power pattern , with net weights resulting from the summed contributions of up to six separate pointings .",
    "note that regions within a given pointing that were included in multiple imaged facets of that pointing do not receive extra weight . for each pointing we included data up to the one - third power point of the primary beam ( about 19 ; refer to figure [ fig - flyseye ] ) , noting the tradeoff of sensitivity with bandwidth and time - averaging smearing .",
    "the output mosaic maintains the 05 pixel size but increases the overall image size to @xmath33 centered on 3@xmath2032@xmath21280 @xmath2227@xmath2348300 .",
    "thus , the final image is about 341 @xmath0 341 and extends to just beyond the edges of the formal e - cdf - s .",
    "it is available for download upon request from the author .",
    "the characteristics of the map were determined by evaluating the local rms noise at every location .",
    "this was achieved using a 2 box size , and contours of the resulting rms map are shown in figure [ fig - rms ] .",
    "it can be seen that the local noise is at its lowest in the center and increases roughly radially , with some variation caused by the slightly increased noise level around the brighter sources ( refer to figure [ fig - msc ] ) .",
    "the fraction of the area covered at a given rms sensitivity or better is shown graphically in figure [ fig - rmsfrac ] .",
    "this figure also shows that the most sensitive regions have local rms noise near 6.4 @xmath1jy beam@xmath11 while effectively all of the image has an rms of 12 @xmath1jy beam@xmath11 or better . within the central @xmath19 ( i.e. , the e - cdf - s region )",
    "the rms noise is 7.9 @xmath1jy beam@xmath11 . as for the individual pointings ,",
    "the noise in the mosaic image is fairly well described by a gaussian ( figure [ fig - noisehist ] ) .",
    "to generate the source catalog , we constructed a signal - to - noise ( @xmath34 ) image by dividing the final mosaic image by the computed local rms image .",
    "sources within the @xmath34 image were identified and fitted by gaussians using the aips task sad , with the task instructed to reject sources with peaks less than 5@xmath14 and produce an output list of all accepted sources .",
    "sad also created a residual image consisting of the input @xmath34 image minus the gaussian fits to accepted sources .",
    "the residual map was then inspected to identify missed sources as well as accepted sources which were poorly fit by sad . in some cases these included single sources which were split into two sources each with lower peak flux density .",
    "missed sources were added to the preliminary source list , and poorly fit sources were flagged for later follow - up .",
    "this modified source list was than used as input to produce the final source catalog .",
    "all sources with peak flux density greater than seven times the local rms noise were fit using the task jmfit , which like sad fits gaussians to sources individually specified by the user .",
    "the output coordinates , peak flux density and error , integrated flux density and error , and a resolution index were recorded .",
    "astrometric observations with the vla at 1.4  ghz indicate a relative positional accuracy of better than 01 , with additional errors in source coordinates arising from source fitting .",
    "this latter error implies that catalog sources near the detection threshhold will have positional errors of up to 02 .",
    "jmfit uses the rms noise of the overall image for determining the errors in the peak and integrated flux densities , so we adjusted these quantities using the local rms noise taken directly from the rms noise map at the coordinates of the source .",
    "this measurement was adopted as the error in the peak flux density , and the error in the integrated flux density was taken to be the jmfit value multiplied by the ratio of the local rms noise divided by the rms noise assumed by jmfit .",
    "we relied on the jmfit deconvolved major and minor axes of the sources in evaluating whether a source might be resolved .",
    "in addition to the nominal deconvolved size of each axis , jmfit provides a estimates of their maximum and minimum deconvolved sizes .",
    "sources for which the minima for both the deconvolved major and minor axes were zero , and hence consistent with being unresolved , were assigned a resolution index value of zero .",
    "sources which were apparently resolved received a one for each axis having a non - zero minimum .",
    "thus a source that jmfit indicated was resolved on both its major and minor axes was assigned a value of two . in this scheme ,",
    "all sources with non - zero resolution index are considered resolved .",
    "sources that were poorly fit by gaussians during the running of sad and subsequent inspection were evaluated using the task tvstat , which allows the user to interactively set an irregularly - shaped aperture around the source and then returns the number of pixels in the region , their mean value , the coordinates corresponding to the maximum flux density , and the integrated flux density . by definition",
    "these sources were resolved and were denoted by using a three for their resolution index in the catalog .",
    "the errors in their integrated flux densities were determined as the square - root of the number of beams contained by the aperture times the local rms .",
    "we note here and in the next section that some caution must be observed when considering whether a source is truly resolved , and subsequently whether to adopt the peak or integrated value for the flux density of that source .",
    "in addition to those considerations generic to gaussian source fitting of radio images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the present image is the mosaic of six individual pointings .",
    "this means that every individual source can have contributions from up to six separate pointings , each of which suffers some degree of bandwidth smearing .",
    "the total flux density of a source will be conserved , although the peak flux density is likely to be lower than its true value on account of bandwidth smearing .",
    "consequently , for each source that jmfit suggested was resolved in the mosaic image we have examined the six images corresponding to the individual pointings .",
    "although these will be of lower signal - to - noise than the final mosaic , the effect of bandwidth smearing on sources within these individual pointings can be assessed using jmfit .",
    "we thus noted which sources that appeared resolved in the mosaic image but were unresolved in the pointing that had its center nearest the source in question .",
    "for these sources , we maintained the resolution index obtained from the fit to the mosaic image but changed its sign .",
    "this preserved the resolution information determined from the mosaic image , but identified sources where effects such as bandwidth smearing might cause an intrinsically unresolved source to appear resolved .",
    "we have chosen to include a 7@xmath14 catalog with this release instead of a lower threshold catalog for several reasons .",
    "the primary one is that this is a first data release , and we will produce a deeper image and more carefully constructed source catalog for the next data release ( see section [ sec - future ] ) . providing a 7@xmath14 catalog provides some assurance that the parameters of identified sources will not change significantly in the next data release and that the incidence of spurious sources will be minimal .",
    "in addition , the 7@xmath14 catalog is a nice match to the source catalog of k2008 , as discussed in the next section ( [ sec - comparisons ] ) .",
    "finally , the fits image corresponding to this first data release is available along with the catalog , thereby allowing interested researchers the opportunity to determine their own source lists and properties .",
    "the catalog is presented in table [ tbl - catalog ] .",
    "it is organized by increasing right ascension , and includes the @xmath34 of each source ( defined as the fitted peak divided by the local rms ) , peak flux density and error , integrated flux density and error , an index evaluating whether the source is resolved ( see above ) , and cross referencing of the sources to other radio surveys of the e - cdf - s ( k2008 , a2006 , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , we have relied on the classifications of the k2008 survey for multiple component sources .",
    "thus , the individual components associated with features arising from a single source are grouped together ( for example , the core and lobes of a powerful radio galaxy ) .",
    "table [ tbl - catalog ] consists of 464 separate sources , 19 of which are broken down into multiple components .",
    "the position and integrated flux density of the multiple component sources are presented in the table , followed by entries for their individual components with positions indented for clarity .",
    "one source with @xmath35 was included in table [ tbl - catalog ] because it was clearly resolved and had an integrated flux density nearly six times greater than its associated error ( the coordinates for this source are 3@xmath2032@xmath213501 @xmath2227@xmath2355328 ) .",
    "this appears to be the only resolved source for which @xmath36 yet the integrated flux density is significant at greater than 5@xmath14 .",
    "the k2008 survey provides a check on the source list and parameters of table [ tbl - catalog ] .",
    "there are 266 sources in k2008 ( including some with multiple components ) , 240 of which are in table [ tbl - catalog ] ( including the one exception for which @xmath36 ) .",
    "the majority of the k2008 sources not included in table [ tbl - catalog ] ( 21/26 ) are detected in the first data release mosaic image with @xmath37 .",
    "four of the remaining five k2008 sources not included in table [ tbl - catalog ] also are present in the first data release mosaic image with @xmath38 , meaning source # 6 of k2008 is the only object which does not seem to be detected in our observations .",
    "this source is a 5.1@xmath14 detection in k2008 , with a flux density of @xmath39 @xmath1jy and a position of 3@xmath2031@xmath211487 @xmath2227@xmath2355434 .",
    "the maximum detected peak flux density within 5@xmath40 of this position in the e - cdf - s first data release mosaic is 16.5 @xmath1jy ( about 1.7@xmath14 ) .",
    "we have adopted the peak flux density for unresolved sources and the integrated flux density for resolved sources ( i.e. , those with resolution index greater than zero ) as the total flux density of that source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compared these values with the corresponding flux densities in k2008 . in the case of sources separated into multiple components , we compared only the total measured flux densities in the two surveys .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ fig - fluxcomp ] that the source flux densities in the two surveys are broadly consistent .",
    "sources that differ from a one - to - one correspondence may result from intrinsic differences in the flux density calibration of the two surveys , the slightly different resolutions of the surveys ( 28@xmath016 compared to the 35@xmath035 of k2008 ) , and real source variability .",
    "the top right panel of figure [ fig - fluxcomp ] depicts only those sources which are unresolved in both surveys , as these are the most direct comparison of derived flux densities .",
    "a slight scaling difference may exist in the sense that the table [ tbl - catalog ] flux densities for these unresolved sources are @xmath41 greater than the k2008 values , although the significance of this difference is only 1.6@xmath14 .",
    "this was determined after applying 3@xmath14 clipping to remove outliers such as variable sources and mis - matched sources , which in this case amounted to three sources .",
    "similarly , comparison of the flux densities for sources which were resolved in both surveys indicated the flux densities were consistent , with the measurements from the current survey being higher than the k2008 values at a significance of only 0.4@xmath14 .",
    "some unresolved sources of k2008 had gaussian fits in our data that suggested the sources were resolved , and these are shown in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig - fluxcomp ] .",
    "similarly , some resolved sources in k2008 were apparently unresolved in our data .",
    "this seemingly counter - intuitive characterization might result from sources consisting of an unresolved core plus diffuse and faint emission , for example .",
    "sources of this type are shown in the bottom right of figure [ fig - fluxcomp ] , and follow the same general pattern as those resolved in the current data but unresolved in k2008 : the measured flux density coming from the survey in which the source is apparently resolved exceeds that from the survey in which it appears unresolved .",
    "presumably this is the result of uncertainties in gaussian fitting to faint sources in the presence of noise @xcite , although it is also consistent with the expectations of source confusion ( one survey may separate nearby sources while the other combines them into a single extended source ) .    additionally , some of the possible slight differences in flux densities may result from different criteria used to assess whether a source is resolved .",
    "k2008 examined the difference between the peak and integrated flux density , and if this difference was less than twice the local rms noise the source was considered unresolved . for such sources",
    "the flux density was taken to be the average of the peak and integrated measurements from jmfit .",
    "we have applied this definition and repeated our tests comparing flux densities for sources in the present survey with those of k2008 . as with comparisons made using the resolution index included in table [ tbl - catalog ] , the flux densities for sources resolved in both surveys were consistent .",
    "sources which were unresolved in both surveys had a slight tendency for the present survey to have higher flux densities ( about @xmath42 , with a 2.6@xmath14 significance that the flux densities are greater than those in k2008 ) .",
    "other procedures commonly used in the literature to evaluate whether a source is resolved also compare peak and integrated flux densities .",
    "for example , @xcite applied such a scheme to deep 1.4  ghz observations of the hubble deep field - south .",
    "they noted that cases where the integrated flux density is less than the peak flux density can safely be assumed to be unresolved sources where the differing flux density measurements are the result of noise in the image and its effect on source fitting .",
    "since this noise can be expected to result in equal numbers of unresolved sources with peak flux density greater than integrated flux density to those with peak flux density less than integrated flux density , the former can be used to set a threshold ( usually as a function of signal - to - noise ) for defining a source as resolved .",
    "our inclusion of both peak and integrated flux densities in table [ tbl - catalog ] , along with making the first data release mosaic image publicly available , provides interested researchers with the information required to apply whichever definition of resolved and unresolved sources they see fit .",
    "we note here that using the resolution index as described in section [ sec - catalog ] and included in table [ tbl - catalog ] provides a good match to the k2008 results if one adopts peak flux densities for unresolved sources and integrated flux densities for resolved ones .",
    "table [ tbl - catalog ] also includes entries for 51 of the 64 sources in the a2006 atca survey data coincident with the goods field . as with the k2008 comparison ,",
    "many of the a2006 sources not present in table [ tbl - catalog ] are detected in the first data release mosaic image with @xmath36 .",
    "however , three of the fainter a2006 sources are not detected ( i.e. , the maximum in the @xmath34 image within 5 of the a2006 position is less than two ) : a2006 # 3 , # 39 , and # 40 .",
    "these are among the more uncertain detections in a2006 , with flux densities of @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 @xmath1jy , respectively .",
    "two further a2006 sources coincide with low significance detections in the first data release mosaic image , although with slight positional offsets ( a2006 # 45 and # 50 ) .",
    "comparison of the flux densities of sources in common again indicates a possible offset in the flux calibration of the present survey , with our flux densities being @xmath46 greater than the a2006 values .",
    "this is a 2.6@xmath14 result based on all common sources regardless of whether they are resolved , as such information is not present in a2006 .",
    "we confirm the result noted in the @xcite analysis of the atca data and discussed further in k2008 , in that the flux density scale of the @xcite catalog appears low by @xmath47 relative to other surveys .    in summary",
    ", there is good agreement between table [ tbl - catalog ] and prior 1.4  ghz data for the e - cdf - s .",
    "the majority of sources detected in k2008 and a2006 are also detected in the first data release mosaic image , with most of these having @xmath48 and hence being included in table [ tbl - catalog ] .",
    "we find slight evidence for an offset in the flux calibration scale , with the table [ tbl - catalog ] values on average appearing greater than those in k2008 .",
    "the magnitude of this scale factor depends on the adopted definition for a resolved source , and amounts to about 3% if one adopts the resolution index and peak flux densities from table [ tbl - catalog ] and compares sources that were unresolved by both studies .",
    "although this first data release achieves good rms sensitivity across the full e - cdf - s area , a number of improvements to the data reduction are possible . as indicated in section [ sec - challenges ] , there were several glitches with the raw ( u , v , w ) data which were overcome by various procedures .",
    "these have now been corrected for all data in the vla archive , meaning downloads of the raw data and reductions `` from scratch '' will avoid some of the forced fixes that were implemented in our reductions , along with any downstream effects thereof .",
    "re - doing the reductions on several individual days of data starting with corrected data from the vla archive suggest an improvement of @xmath49 in the achieved rms sensitivity .",
    "in addition , there are several well - known and time - intensive reduction procedures that we have not yet implemented but will implement for the next data release .",
    "most of these amount to imaging the data in segments rather than all together .",
    "first , the vla right circular polarization and left circular polarization beams are slightly separated , meaning they have slightly different pointings on the sky ( `` beam squint '' ) .",
    "imaging the two polarizations separately and then optimally combining the output maps can therefore improve the noise level and dynamic range of the final map . as with most imaging considerations at 1.4  ghz",
    "the effect is greatest for sources distant from the phase center , the sidelobes of which degrade the overall image .",
    "similarly , observing in two bands at separate intermediate frequencies straddling 1.4  ghz ( 1.365  ghz and 1.435  ghz ) results in slightly different resolutions and consequently slightly different instrumental gains .",
    "the solution is the same as for the separate polarizations , in that the two intermediate frequencies can be imaged separately , restored to the same resolution , and then combined .",
    "next , over the course of each five - hour observing track the shape of the primary beam rotates on the sky and sources away from the pointing center appear to vary .",
    "again , this can be alleviated by imaging the data in smaller portions set by fixed ranges of observed hour angle and combining the resulting images .",
    "finally , new functionality in aips provides improved self - calibration of bright interfering sources ( `` peelr '' ) .",
    "this will clean up much of the `` ripples '' around bright sources , noticeable in figure [ fig - rms ] as slight increases in the local rms sensitivity around such sources . from experience with other programs",
    ", we anticipate the net improvement resulting from the combination of these improved imaging steps to be on the order of 10% .",
    "the next data release will also include improvements to the source catalog .",
    "it will increase the total number of sources on account of improvements to the sensitivity and application of a less conservative detection limit . as implied in section",
    "[ sec - comparisons ] there are hundreds of likely real detected sources with peak flux densities in the @xmath50 range",
    ". the characteristics of all detected sources will also be more rigorously determined . in table",
    "[ tbl - catalog ] we have generally assumed that the gaussian fit parameters determined by jmfit were a good representation of any given source . it is known , however , that gaussian fits to faint sources in the presence of noise are biased and yield overestimates for peak flux densities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "comparison of flux densities measured through gaussian fits with ones derived through photometry performed in concentric apertures can be used to produce more accurate flux densities ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps the most glaring omission from the information in table [ tbl - catalog ] is the lack of information on source size other than a descriptive index on whether the source appeared to be resolved .",
    "better handling of the combined effects of bandwidth and time average smearing from six separate pointing centers is needed in order to ascertain whether sources are truly resolved or merely appear to be due to instrumental effects .",
    "this will also allow for the reporting of reasonable estimates and associated errors for source sizes .",
    "we have presented the survey strategy , observational details , data reduction procedure , and first data release for the vla 1.4  ghz survey of the extended _ chandra _ deep field south . the mosaic image corresponding to this first data release contains the full e - cdf - s area and is available by contacting the author .",
    "it reaches an rms sensitivity of 6.4 @xmath1jy per 28@xmath016 beam at its most sensitive point , with a typical rms sensitivity of 8 @xmath1jy across the full image .",
    "a 7@xmath14 catalog of 464 sources , 19 of which consist of multiple components , is provided in table [ tbl - catalog ] .",
    "comparison with existing surveys confirms that the relative flux density scale is accurate to within a few percent , although users are cautioned that source extraction for fainter sources leads to larger errors .",
    "the importance of the e - cdf - s to the astronomical community has driven us to provide this first data release in an expeditious manner .",
    "significant improvements in the achievable rms sensitivity and catalog construction are possible , and we anticipate a second data release including these improvements for january 2009 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the hard work of the nrao staff . that this program was successful in the midst of a very dynamic time in the transition to evla",
    "is a strong testament to their dedication .",
    "we also thank mark dickinson , anton koekemoer , rob ivison , and glenn morrison for valuable discussions about the motivations and planning of this program , and the anonymous referee for prompting additional testing to confirm the reliability of the reported flux densities .",

    "<S> we have observed the extended _ chandra _ deep field south ( e - cdf - s ) using a mosaic of six deep very large array ( vla ) pointings at 1.4  ghz . in this paper , we present the survey strategy , description of the observations , and the first data release . </S>",
    "<S> the observations were performed during june through september of 2007 and included from 15 to 17 `` classic '' vla antennas and 6 to 11 that had been retrofitted for the expanded vla ( evla ) . </S>",
    "<S> the first data release consists of a 341@xmath0341 image and the attendant source catalog . </S>",
    "<S> the image achieves an rms sensitivity of 6.4 @xmath1jy per 28@xmath016 beam in its deepest regions , with a typical sensitivity of 8 @xmath1jy . </S>",
    "<S> the catalog is conservative in that it only lists sources with peak flux densities greater than seven times the local rms noise , yet it still contains 464 sources . </S>",
    "<S> nineteen of these are complex sources consisting of multiple components . </S>",
    "<S> cross matching of the catalog to prior surveys of the e - cdf - s confirms the linearity of the flux density calibration , albeit with a slight possible offset ( a few percent ) in scale . </S>",
    "<S> improvements to the data reduction and source catalog are ongoing , and we intend to produce a second data release in january 2009 . </S>"
