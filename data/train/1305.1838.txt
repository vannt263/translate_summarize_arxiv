    "@xmath48 , if @xmath46 is known on any open subset of @xmath48 , it is known on @xmath48 by the analytic continuation .    the inverse problem that we shall consider is to recover the medium inclusion @xmath49 and/or the pec obstacle @xmath36 by the knowledge of @xmath50 . in the physical situation , the inhomogeneous em medium and the obstacle are the unknown / inaccessible target objects",

    "this inverse scattering problem is of critical importance in many areas of science and technology , such as radar and sonar , geophysical exploration , medical imaging and non - destructive testing , to name just a few ( cf.@xcite ) .",

    "there are many results in the literature and various imaging schemes have been developed ; see , e.g. @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it is remarked that most existing schemes involve inversions , and in order to tackle the ill - posedness , regularizations are always utilized . for the present study ,",

    ", we note that in , the unknown scatterer depends on a 3d parameter @xmath17 , whereas the far - field pattern depends on a 2d parameter @xmath53 , and hence , much less information is used for the proposed reconstruction scheme .",
    "the inverse electromagnetic scattering problem with minimum measurement data is extremely challenging with very limited theoretical and computational progress in the literature ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we shall conduct our study in a very general and complex environment .",
    "the target scatterer may consist of multiple components with an unknown number , and each component could be either an inhomogeneous medium inclusion or a pec obstacle .",
    "two imaging schemes using a single measurement were recently proposed in @xcite , namely schemes s and r , for locating multiple em scatterer components , respectively , of small size and regular size compared to the wavelength of the incident em plane waves .",
    "the schemes rely on certain new indicator functions , which can be directly calculated from the measured far - field data . in calculating the indicator functions ,",
    "there are no inversions or regularizations and hence the proposed schemes are shown to be very efficient and robust to noisy data .",
    "however , scheme r , the locating scheme for regular - size scatterers , requires the _ a priori _ knowledge of the possible shapes , orientations and sizes of the underlying scatterer components .",
    "it is our first goal to extend scheme r in @xcite to an improved scheme ar by relaxing the requirement on orientations and sizes .",
    "this is achieved in light of the idea that the admissible reference space can be augmented by more data carrying information about orientations and sizes .",
    "next , based on the newly developed scheme ar and scheme s in @xcite , in a certain generic practical setting , we develop a novel imaging procedure ( scheme m ) in locating multiple multi - scale em scatterers , which include both regular - size and small - size components .",
    "a novel local re - sampling technique is proposed and plays a key role in tackling the challenging multi - scale reconstruction in scheme m. furthermore , for the multi - scale locating scheme , if one additional set of far - field data is used , more robust and accurate reconstruction can be achieved . to our best knowledge , this is the first reconstruction scheme in the literature on recovering multi - scale em scatterers by using such less scattering information .",
    "for all the proposed imaging schemes , we provide rigorous mathematical justifications . we also conduct systematical numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and the promising features of the schemes .",
