    "[ sec1 ]    selective area growth ( sag ) of compound semiconductor thin films by ( metalorganic ) vapor phase epitaxy on patterned , masked substrates is a useful technique for fabricating semiconductor devices @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the masked substrates may also be used as a diagnostic tool ; the crystals grown in artificial geometries may indicate what would be successful or unsuccessful conditions for producing a desired product . the masked substrates may also be used simply for fundamental understanding of the crystal growth process @xcite-@xcite .    generally , the method consists of the deposition of an epitaxial layer on defined areas of the substrate , which are exposed to the vapor phase via windows lithographically etched through a masking layer . for semiconductor device processing",
    "the mask is usually a dielectric material such as sio@xmath0 or si@xmath1n@xmath2 . in some cases , crystal growth on the mask",
    "is not desirable but , in reality , growth is observed there more often than not @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the growth on the mask may occur via lateral overgrowth from the window in the mask or via nucleation on the mask ; the narrower the mask the less likely is nucleation .",
    "following @xcite , we will denote the lateral overgrowth phenomena as `` epitaxial lateral overgrowth '' ( elog ) in case of growth in narrow windows ( @xmath3 in width ) .",
    "we refer to the selective growth on larger areas ( hundreds of microns ) as sag .",
    "in sag and elog the overall growth rate and uniformity of the epitaxial deposit have been reported to be strongly dependent upon the geometry of masked regions @xcite as well as the total pressure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the deposits are characterized by an enhanced growth at the perimeter of the windows adjacent to the mask ( excellent photographs of the enhanced growth and the elog regions of gainas(p ) and inp can be found in @xcite , for example ) .",
    "this suggests that material is supplied to the unmasked areas by surface diffusion along the mask as well as through direct diffusion from the vapor phase .",
    "it is generally concluded that diffusion lengths on the mask and on the surface of the epitaxial material such as gaas , si or gan are very short ( of the order of @xmath4 ) . under these conditions , the dominant lateral mass transport mechanism from the mask regions , for distances greater than a few ( say @xmath5 ) microns ,",
    "is usually attributed to vapor - phase diffusion @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , surface diffusion usually dominates @xcite for the growth in narrow windows bounded by narrow mask regions ( @xmath6 microns ) and it is this case ( elog ) that we are interested in studying .    in our opinion , there exist two types of mathematical models for the selective - area growth .",
    "type 1 models operate by solving laplace s @xcite or the diffusion equation @xcite for the concentration of species in the vapor phase , subject to appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the solution yields the concentration profiles in the vapor .",
    "surface diffusion is ignored in these models .",
    "type 2 models attempt to account for surface diffusion in several ways . in @xcite , the steady - state diffusion equation for the concentration of species on the mask",
    "is added to the laplace s equation in the vapor , while the diffusion on the crystal surface is ignored . in @xcite , the time - dependent diffusion equation for the concentration of species on the crystal surface",
    "is considered , while the diffusion on the mask is ignored . in @xcite ,",
    "the steady - state diffusion equation describes diffusion on both the mask and crystal surfaces , again with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "neither type 1 nor type 2 models allow the overgrowth of the crystal on the mask ( except @xcite ) , nor do they account for the topography of the mask ( i.e. , the mask is considered to be of zero thickness ) .",
    "they also do not compute the crystal surface shape . as far",
    "as we know , the anisotropic selective - area growth has not been modeled .",
    "the goal of this paper is to give a physically and mathematically consistent description of epitaxial semiconductor crystal growth on a masked substrate in a surface diffusion - limited regime .",
    "the model is based on two partial differential equations ; one for the crystal surface dynamics and one for the surface concentration of atoms on the mask .",
    "the substrate is exposed in the periodic series of parallel long trenches etched in the mask .",
    "diffusion in the vapor phase is ignored since we consider elog in this study .",
    "other simplifying assumptions are :    * the perturbations caused by selective - area epitaxy are independent of the orientation of the trenches with respect to the crystallographic axes of the substrate . in other words , in this study we ignore the anisotropy of the crystal growth ( the results for the anisotropic growth will be reported elsewhere @xcite ) ; * the diffusion coefficients are constants .",
    "it means that we have also assumed that the temperature is constant over the calculation window .",
    "the assumption of the constant temperature seems reasonable since we consider the case of the growth on narrow regions of the substrate ( as explained above ) ; * the ( possible ) interaction between densely arrayed growth regions is ignored .",
    "the numerical methodology we make use of in this study is not suitable for the latter problem .",
    "other numerical methods ( such as the level set method @xcite ) should be employed to study the crystal surfaces originating from different growth regions beyond the point of their merging .",
    "the model is designed to allow the direct computation of the crystal surface shape .",
    "in addition , it allows to study effects due to mask regions of effectively nonzero thickness .    the equations and added physical boundary conditions and initial conditions are nondimensionalized using physical constants estimated for experiments on elog and sag of gaas - type materials @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a finite difference method is used to find approximate solutions to the nondimensionalized , fully nonlinear parametric evolution equations which govern the crystal surface dynamics .",
    "the numerical solutions exhibit the crystal overgrowth onto the mask and enhanced growth in the region adjacent to the contact point ( a contact line in three dimensions ) where the mask and the crystal surfaces meet .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we formulate the mathematical model , list physical constants , provide details of nondimensionalization and find an approximate solution to the problem for diffusion of the concentration on the mask . in section [ sec3 ] we describe the numerical method we use to solve the nonlinear initial / boundary value problem for the crystal / vapor interface . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we present the numerical results for the elog in the assumption of nonzero thickness of the mask . by setting mask thickness to zero we",
    "obtain more representative results in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] we provide the qualitative comparison of the results obtained to the existing results we found in the literature and give conclusions and future directions for research .",
    "in this section , we describe the mathematical model which is an initial / boundary value problem consisting of two partial differential equations , one describing the surface concentration of the atoms on the mask and the other involving the motion of the crystal / vapor interface originating from the exposed substrate .",
    "we also introduce physical constants and use them to nondimensionalize the problem .",
    "this model development was partly given in @xcite .",

    "one way to deal with this situation is to instantly readjust the angle the curve forms with the upper mask surface to the equilibrium value once the contact point reaches the step corner .",
    "however , such instant readjustment causes a short retraction into the unphysical domain @xmath155 . to avoid this retraction , we pin the contact point at the corner and allow the contact angle with respect to the upper mask surface to readjust to the equilibrium contact angle there . once the desired angle is reached , the contact point resumes motion along the mask .",

    "the value of @xmath157 depends on the relative tolerance chosen to measure the disappearence of the  bump \" ; for instance , with the relative tolerance 0.005 used to compute the curve in figure [ fig4](a ) and for @xmath143 ( case of figure [ fig2](b ) ) the value for @xmath157 is 73.3 .",

    "the normalized maximum growth rate decreases with the mask thickness because the  bump \" smooths out as the crystal grows vertically .",
    "the value of @xmath169 depends on the mask thickness ; for the case of figure [ fig2](b ) , @xmath170 .    the numerical experiments described in this section and in section [ sec5 ] were run on a single 300 mhz r12000 cpu on an sgi origin 2000 workstation .",

    ".    figure [ fig6 ] shows the dependence of the normalized position of the contact point on @xmath172 and @xmath14 . as in the case of the mask layer of nonvanishing thickness , the overgrowth onto the mask is larger for larger contact angles . for a given contact angle ,",
    "the overgrowth decreases with increasing @xmath172 and @xmath14 , with the dependence of the overgrowth in figure [ fig6](b ) on @xmath14 being approximately linear .",
    "note that the variation in @xmath172 has stronger impact on the overgrowth than the variation in @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig6](a ) suggests that wider mask regions will result in the saturation of the overgrowth .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the model .",
    "indeed , the surface diffusion flux from the mask onto the growing crystal is the driving force for elog , with another component of the driving force being the constant flux of atoms from the vapor on the crystal surface .",
    "the flux on the mask is given by ( [ 2.26 ] ) and it saturates as @xmath178 increases ( the close - to - linear dependence of the elog on @xmath14 ca nt be easily explained since all nondimensional parameters of the problem are functions of @xmath14 , ref .",

    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the similar dependence of the normalized maximum growth thickness on @xmath172 and @xmath14 and the same explanation applies to the curves in figure [ fig7](a ) .",
    "it is interesting that the characteristic time @xmath179 does not depend on the contact angle .",
    "that is , having @xmath14 fixed , the time needed for elog over the distance @xmath172 is independent on the ratio of the crystal to the mask surface energies ( for the case of figure [ fig5](a ) , @xmath180 ) .",
    "film thickness at the center of the substrate region ( @xmath62 ) as a function of @xmath172 and @xmath14 is shown in figure [ fig8 ] .",

    "film thickness at the center of the substrate region increases essentially linear in @xmath69 , with rate @xmath181 .",
    "there is no dependence of the growth at substrate center on the contact angle .",
    "we developed a model for the epitaxial semiconductor crystal growth on a masked substrate in a surface diffusion - limited growth regime .    in this model ,",
    "the overgrowth of the crystal on the mask ( as well as growth in vertical direction ) is a dynamic process which depends on many factors , such as the height of the mask above the substrate , the widths of masked and open regions , the ratio of mask to substrate surface tensions , etc . unlike type 1 and type 2 models cited in the introduction",
    ", our model does not assume the overgrowth or lack of the overgrowth _ a priori _ , while in these models the assumption is made based on results of specific experiment which the model aims to describe .",
    "despite the fact that numerical results presented in sections [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] always exhibit the overgrowth , the trial runs with anisotropy included in the model indicated that the overgrowth could be suppressed by selecting the degree of anisotropy and the fast growth directions @xcite .",
    "the predictions of the modeling compare favorably to the results obtained by other authors .",
    "the region of enhanced growth near the contact point (  bump \" ) shown in figure [ fig2 ] supports the experimental and theoretical evidence for the surface diffusion on the mask to contribute strongly to such enhanced growth @xcite , @xcite-@xcite . eventually , the  bump \" is smoothed out by the surface diffusion on the crystal surface .",
    "the profiles of the crystal surface we obtained show close resemblance to experimental profile in figure 5(b ) of @xcite and to experimental profiles in figures 4 and 5 of @xcite . to make such comparison , our computed profiles should be truncated , at some given time , with imaginary vertical line passing to the left of the  bump \" maxima .",
    "the right part of the profile is then shifted to the right so that the left endpoint stays on the vertical line at @xmath94 ( to account for the lack of the overgrowth in the works cited ) .",
    "the detailed comparison with these and other experimental works is , however , impossible since the natural anisotropy of the crystal growth is not accounted for in this study .",
    "the linear dependence of the normalized maximum growth thickness and of the film thickness at the center of the substrate region on the width of the substrate region @xmath14 ( ref . figures [ fig7](b ) , [ fig8](b ) ) was found experimentally in @xcite for the surface diffusion dominated growth .",
    "also , figure [ fig8](a ) shows that the film thickness at the center of the substrate region monotonically increases with the mask width @xmath172 due to the increase of the lateral source supply .",
    "this result is well known @xcite .",
    "again , similar dependence was found experimentally in @xcite for the surface diffusion dominated growth .",
    "note that the normalized maximum growth thickness in figure [ fig7](a ) decreases with @xmath172 despite that the film thickness at @xmath62 increases with @xmath172 .",
    "the reason is that surface diffusion along the crystal surface has a strong smoothing effect in the regions of the surface where the curvature is large .",
    "future directions for the research include considering anisotropic growth , the diffusion in the vapor and the application of external fields .",
