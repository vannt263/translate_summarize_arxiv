    "the combined method proposed here can be easily implemented in the experiment , and thus opens a way to the creation of 3d solitons in becs .",
    "another physical implication of the results is a stable 3d  light bullet \" in an optical medium with an alternating longitudinal self - focusing / defocusing structure , and periodic modulation of the refractive index in a transverse direction .",
    "the possibility to achieve the result was demonstrated within the framework of the variational approximation ( va ) and verified in direct simulations . in particular",
