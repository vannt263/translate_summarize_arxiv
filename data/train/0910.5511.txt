    "in 1957 , bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer published the well - known microscopic theory of superconductivity.@xcite since then most physicists have come to believe that the superconducting state involve electron pairs bound together by the exchange of phonons ( atomic lattice vibrations ) . in the bcs framework , it is the lattice vibrations that provides the binding energy of electrons in the cooper pairs .",
    "this great theory has been intensively challenged by the discovery of cuprate superconductors with a critical temperature as high as 164 k , @xcite some theoretical condensed matter physicists have started to doubt the reliability of the phonon - exchange - pairing superconducting mechanism.@xcite they consider that phonons should be effectively ruled - out as the underlying cause of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "consequently , many alternative quasiparticles with energies higher than the phonon frequencies have been proposed as the reason causes the loss of electrical resistance at the higher temperatures .",
    "in fact , these efforts have caused much more controversy about how can strongly repulsive electrons form a condensate that flows without resistance .    in the field of superconducting ,",
    "the phenomenon of superconductivity is normally interpreted in two physical spaces : the momentum space and the real space . in our opinion , it is more reliable to discuss physical problems in the real space where electron - electron and electron - ion interactions can be illustrated in a very direct and clear manner .",
    "however , researchers seem prefer to carry out all their study in the momentum - space ( dynamic screening ) . besides , in order to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the physical description , there should not be any essential difference between the real - space picture and momentum - space picture .",
    "as we know , the bcs formalism was established in the momentum - space where the superconducting electrons are paired in a coherent order quantum state , while in real - space these electrons are in a disorder phase .",
    "the fundamental differences between two physical pictures of superconducting electrons reveal that the momentum - space bcs theory is not the final theory of the superconductivity .",
    "more importantly , coulomb interaction is the elementary electrical force that causes two negative electrons to repel each other , furthermore , the random interactions between electrons and lattice ions can not be ignored .",
    "but , from the perspective of the real - space dynamics , any small differences in force applied to each electron of a cooper pair could lead to the breakdown of pairing correlations .",
    "so how can the real - space repulsion between electrons and the electron - ion interactions be eliminated to support the formation of the cooper pairs ?",
    "obviously , the bcs theory of momentum - space can not avoid this crucial challenge .    with the invention and the application of the modern experimental techniques , for example the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm )",
    ", @xcite researchers now can look inside  into the superconductors and see  the superconducting electrons .",
    "motivated by these new results , more and more researchers have tried replace the conventional superconducting picture ( dynamic screening ) with a real space picture where the superconducting electrons congregate in some quasi - one - dimensional rivers of charge ( or vortex lines , stripes ) separated by insulating domains .",
    "@xcite obviously , to construct a proper model and theory related to the formation of the one - dimensional charge rivers will be a major challenge for those devoting themselves to crack the mystery of high - temperature superconductivity . in recent years",
    ", we have proposed a real space superconducting mechanism which provide new insights into the nature of the charge stripes .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we provide a complete theoretical analysis of how can the coulomb repulsion between electrons be eliminated in favor of electron pairing and superconducting .",
    "moreover , the physical nature of pseudogap phenomenon and @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry are also naturally understood on the basis of the short - range real space coulomb confinement effect .",
    "in the momentum space ( dynamic screening ) , the superconducting electrons are randomly distributed in the real - space at the same time .",
    "this implies that there does nt exist two itinerant electrons ( the so - called pairing electrons ) with the exactly the same interaction environment .",
    "hence , the coulomb interaction between two electrons ( cooper pair ) of the dynamic screening can not be completely suppressed by the other electrons and ions .",
    "now , how can the repulsion between electrons be suppressed to support the occurrence of superconductivity ?",
    "the answer lies in the quasi - one - dimensional real - space stripes , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    in the previous paper , @xcite we proved theoretically that a static one - dimensional vortex line ( peierls chain , or charge stripe ) can be naturally formed inside the superconducting plane .",
    "the stable charge stripe is confined by the domain - walls of the positive ions ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . driven by an external electric field , there will occur a charge ordering phase transition from the stable peierls chain ( the superconducting ground state of @xmath1 ) to the periodic chain ( the superconducting excited state of @xmath2 ) in any superconductors , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for three - dimensional superconductors",
    ", the vortex lines can further self - organize into some thermodynamically stable vortex lattices with trigonal or tetragonal symmetry .    in any superconducting materials",
    ", to a very good approximation , there are mainly two kinds of coulomb interactions on superconducting electron : ( 1 ) electron - electron repulsive interactions , and ( 2)electron - ion attractive interactions . in our superconducting scenarios , to maintain the zero resistance property of the superconductors it is necessary that all superconducting electrons should be in the zero - force state , or electron is the inertial electrons .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the forces applied to one of the electrons in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . due to the crystal symmetry in @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions , all the forces ( electron - ion interactions ) in these two directions",
    "are canceled in opposite directions .",
    "this can be expressed mathematically as follows : @xmath5    in the @xmath6-direction of charge stripe , the forces on the electron come from the electron - electron interactions inside the charge stripe . in our scenarios ,",
    "when a superconductor enters into the superconducting state , all the superconducting electrons can be considered as the inertial electrons  and forces on any one of them should be balanced .",
    "hence we have @xmath7    according to the symmetry of the charge stripe , it is not difficult to find that the condition above can be satisfied naturally without depending on any glue . generally , for an infinite one - dimensional superconducting periodic chain with the electron - electron spacing @xmath8 and electron - transfer velocity @xmath2 ( as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "now , let us suppose one of the electrons ( marked by 0  in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) has a small displacement in @xmath3-direction ( @xmath9 ) , if the velocity @xmath1 , the other electrons inside the stripe will repel the electron 0  through the electrostatic field .",
    "the repulsive forces from the symmetry electron pair @xmath10 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] can be expressed as : @xmath11where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the electrostatic field generated by the electron @xmath14 and electron @xmath15 , respectively , and @xmath16 is the unit vector in @xmath3-direction .",
    "when the velocity @xmath17 , apart from the repulsive electrostatic force , the electron @xmath18 will experience an attractive magnetic force exerted by the other electrons . according to electromagnetic theory , we can find that the magnetic field generated by the electron @xmath14 around the by the electron @xmath18 can be expressed as : @xmath19 the above magnetic field will exert on the moving electron @xmath18 with the following lorentz force : @xmath20    similarly , we can define a pair of magnetic force on the electron @xmath18 as follow @xmath21 from eq .",
    "( [ force_e ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ force_m1 ] ) , we have the following representation : @xmath22 because @xmath23 , thus from eq .",
    "( [ force_em ] ) it follows that the magnetic attraction @xmath24 is always less than the electric repulsion @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath26 , then we have @xmath27 .",
    "now , combining eq .",
    "( [ force_e ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ force_m1 ] ) , we have the total electromagnetic force on the electron : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a zeta function .    it can be easily found from eq .",
    "( [ forcet ] ) , if the displacement @xmath30 , the @xmath31 is always positive . then from the view point of energy , this repulsive force will lead directly to an increase in the system energy , which in turn decrease the stability of the superconducting state .",
    "but , it is clear that if @xmath32 , we have @xmath33 according to eq .",
    "( [ forcet ] ) .",
    "this result indicates that a perfect one - dimensional charge - chain can not only reduce the energy of the superconducting state , but also eliminate completely the repulsion between the electrons inside the charge stripe .",
    "one of the highly controversial issues in the understanding of high - temperature superconductivity is the origin of the normal - state gap ( pseudogap ) .",
    "there are many theories and models attempt to describe the pseudogap phase , yet its nature remains a mystery . here",
    "we present a new interpretation of pseudogap based on the simple real - space coulomb confinement effect .    in the framework of the real - space approach ( as discussed in the above section ) ,",
    "the most important unit of the superconducting phase is the one - dimensional long - range correlated charge stripes that may form through long - range lattice confinement effect ( electron - electron and electron - ion interactions ) .",
    "however , we will show that the nearest - neighbor electron - ion correlation may be responsible for the mechanism of the pseudogap .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows two electrons ( a cooper pair ) inside a unit cell of different superconductors . for the cases of figs .",
    "[ fig4](a)-(c ) , it is not difficult to find that the cooper pair  will be split up due to electron - ion interactions , while the cooper pair can survive in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) in two special directions .    in",
    "what follows , we pay our attention to the case of fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) .",
    "we try to show how can two repulsive electrons stay together inside a single plaquette and discuss the pairing symmetry of the corresponding pseudogap phase . here",
    ", we consider only two specific situations where two electrons ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 of fig . [ fig5 ] ) arranged on a line in @xmath6 and @xmath36-direction , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , there are four nearest - neighbor ions ( marked by 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) with a negative charge ( @xmath37 ) and four next - nearest - neighbor ions ( marked by 5 , 6 , 7 , 8) with a positive charge ( @xmath38 ) around the electron pair . in these two cases , because of the structural symmetry , we can present the explicit analytical expressions of the confinement forces on the electrons . figures fig5(a ) and",
    "( b ) illustrate the eight coulomb forces ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) exerted on the electron @xmath34 by the ions and the repulsive force ( @xmath47 ) inside the pair . based on fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ( for the sake of simplicity , suppose @xmath48 ) , we can get a general formula of the total confinement force @xmath49 applied to the electron @xmath34 in @xmath6-direction as :    @xmath50    the well - known coulomb repulsion @xmath47 can be represented as @xmath51where @xmath52 is the electron - electron spacing which can be used to characterize the size of the cooper pair .",
    "@xmath53 is the total nearest - neighbor coulomb force which is defined as @xmath54and the total next - nearest - neighbor coulomb force @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath56the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by @xmath61 similarly , in @xmath36-direction , we have @xmath62and the corresponding functions are defined by @xmath63the four distance parameters above are given by @xmath64where @xmath65    in the framework of our theory , whether the two electrons become paired ( characterized by the pseudogap ) in figs .

[",
    "fig5](a ) [ or fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] . with the analytical expressions from ( [ force_y ] ) to ( [ d1_4 ] ) , we draw in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the total forces ( @xmath49 and @xmath66 ) on the electron @xmath34 ( a similar discussion may be expected to be valid for the electron @xmath35 ) versus @xmath74 for the cases of the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig6](a ) shows the relation between @xmath49 and @xmath75 under the nearest - neighbor condition . as can be seen from the figure ,",
    "there exist always one @xmath52 with the force @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , with the increasing of the charge of the ions @xmath70 from @xmath76 , @xmath77 to @xmath78 , the size of cooper pair @xmath52 will decrease eventually from @xmath79 , @xmath80 to @xmath81 , indicating a stronger confinement effect and a higher cooper - pair binding energy .",
    "when the two electrons arranged in @xmath36-direction , the forces @xmath66 are always positive for any given @xmath82 ( or @xmath70 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "this result implies that the pair along @xmath36-direction can be easily destroyed due to the coulomb interaction between the pair and ions .",
    "if we use the parameter @xmath52 as a measure of the binding energy ( @xmath83 ) of the cooper pair , it is not difficult to conclude that the pair parallel to @xmath3- and @xmath6-axis has a minimum @xmath52 that leads to a maximum binding energy in these four directions , while the binding energy may be zero when the pair in the four diagonal directions .",
    "hence , the nearest - neighbor electron - ion interactions can directly lead to the @xmath0-wave pseudogap observed in the cuprate superconductors . to make this argument more convincing",
    ", we will take into account the next - nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "when both the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions are present in the calculation of the force @xmath49 and @xmath66 , we find that the real - space electron pairing symmetry ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) does not change comparing to fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] of the nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "figure [ fig7](a ) shows that the adding of the next - nearest - neighbor interactions almost does not affect the electron pair in the @xmath6-direction , very little difference in the size of cooper pair @xmath52 can be observed ( see the insert figure ) . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , although significant changes were observed in the figure , but the force @xmath66 can be guaranteed to be positive when considering different next - nearest - neighbor interactions ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "furthermore , the larger @xmath66 indicates that the two electrons are much more difficult to be paired in the diagonal directions .",
    "these results confirm our argument that the nearest - neighbor electron - ion interactions play an important role in the origin of the pseudogap phenomenon .    from our study of the mechanism of the pseudogap based on the short - range real - space coulomb confinement effect ,",
    "the pair - pair interactions have been completely neglected .",
    "this approximation is reasonable to describe the underdoped cuprate superconductors with a small carrier concentration .",
    "whereas for the overdoped superconductors , the pseudogap phase will be destroyed by pair - pair interactions , as shown by the experimental results .",
    "besides , the characteristic of local nearest - neighbor interactions of our theory implies that the pseudogap phenomenon can be found from a wide variety of materials , especially those with low carrier concentrations , such as the semiconductors and some insulation materials .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the coulomb repulsion between electrons can be completely eliminated only if the charge carriers ( electrons ) self - organize into some quasi - one - dimensional charge stripes ( vortex lines ) .",
    "it has been argued that the superconducting ground states are guaranteed by the energy minimum quasi - one - dimensional peierls chains which are formed with the lattice confinement effect . in the framework of our theory ,",
    "all the superconducting electrons can be considered as the inertial electrons  at some stable zero - force positions .",
    "furthermore , we have proved analytically that two electrons , due to the nearest - neighbor electromagnetic interactions , can be in pairing inside a single plaquette with the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry .",
