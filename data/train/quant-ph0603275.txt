    "entanglement of separate systems certainly represents one of the most striking features of quantum physics , both for its fundamental nonlocal behavior @xcite and for its applications in quantum information processing @xcite . for these reasons , it is important to have implementable methods to generate entangled states between separate systems in various contexts .    in cavity",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) several schemes , exploiting typical atom - cavity interactions , have been proposed to obtain , in two separate single - mode cavities , entangled one - photon number states @xcite . in this context",
    ", it would be of interest to get entanglement between electromagnetic field states with mesoscopic characteristics and therefore having a maximum number of photons larger than one , so that the classical - quantum border may be investigated .    in this paper",
    "we propose a conditional scheme aimed at generating entangled two - photons generalized binomial states ( 2gbss ) inside two separate single - mode high-@xmath0 cavities .",
    "our scheme requires that the two cavities are initially prepared in entangled one - photon generalized binomial states @xcite . in order to reach our goal",
    ", we exploit the passage of two appropriately prepared atoms one in each cavity and measure the atomic state of both atoms when they exit the cavities .",
    "we will show that the probability of success is larger than or equal to @xmath1 , and depends on the degree of entanglement we wish establish between the two cavities .",
    "we also give a brief evaluation of the implementation of the scheme .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ gensch ] we recall the jaynes - cummings model that regulates the dynamics of the system and we illustrate the scheme to generate entangled 2gbss in two separate cavities , briefly discussing its implementation ; in sec .",
    "[ concl ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "the generation scheme here proposed exploits the resonant interaction of a two - level atoms with a single - mode high-@xmath0 cavity described by the usual jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the atom - field coupling constant , @xmath4 is the resonant cavity field mode , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the field annihilation and creation operators and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the pseudo - spin operators , @xmath10 and @xmath11 being respectively the excited and ground state of the two - level atom .",
    "it is well known that the hamiltonian @xmath12 generates the evolutions @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "the scheme we are going to discuss , illustrated for simplicity in fig.[scheme ] , follows standard procedures currently used for cqed experiments @xcite .",

    "( [ entbernoulli ] ) , @xmath21 denotes the single - mode state of the @xmath22-th cavity .",
    "the state @xmath23 can be deterministically obtained following , for example , the scheme reported in ref .",
    "consider now a couple of identical two - level rydberg atoms in the entangled state @xmath24 this state can be prepared using , for example , the scheme suggested by gerry @xcite . before entering the cavity  @xmath22 , the @xmath22-th atom crosses a ramsey zone @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) where it resonantly interacts with a classical field undergoing the transformations @xmath27 with the versor @xmath28 .",
    "as well known , by adjusting the amplitude of the classical ramsey field as well as the interaction time between this field and the atom , we have the possibility to control both the two quantities @xmath29 , the so - called `` ramsey pulse '' , and @xmath30 . stated another way , we can prepare an arbitrary superposition of the two atomic states @xmath31 .",
    "putting in particular @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the same parameters that appear in the entangled state @xmath23 of eq .",
    "( [ entbernoulli ] ) , the transformations of eqs .",

    "the dynamics of the two subsystems `` atom+cavity '' 1 and 2 are independent .",
    "so , starting from the total atom - cavity state of eq .",
    "( [ phi0 ] ) and using the explicit expressions of the cavity and atomic states given in eqs .",

    "( [ sincond ] ) can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "let us however observe that , solving the first condition of eq .",
    "( [ sincond ] ) , we get @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is a non - negative integer",
    ". thus we can look for suitable values of @xmath45 in correspondence of which the second condition of eq .",
    "( [ sincond ] ) is approximatively satisfied .",
    "the choice of @xmath45 however must be done coherently with the typical experimental values of the interaction times in cqed systems ( @xmath46 @xcite ) , thus confining the values of @xmath45 inside the range @xmath47 . fixing ,",
    "in particular , @xmath48 and therefore the same interaction time in the two cavities given by @xmath49 we find that @xmath50 within this approximation we can consider the second condition of eq .",
    "( [ sincond ] ) as satisfied , too .",
    "so , utilizing eq .",
    "( [ binevo ] ) with @xmath51 , we find that , if the condition @xmath52 is verified , the total atom - cavity state @xmath53 of eq .",

    "( [ entbin2 ] ) represents entangled orthogonal 2gbss in two separate single - mode high-@xmath0 cavities . from eq .",
    "( [ enttot ] ) , the probability of finding both atoms in the ground state after exiting the cavities , i.e. the probability of success to obtain our target state @xmath58 , is given by @xmath59 following ref .",
    "@xcite , the degree of entanglement of the state @xmath58 is given by @xmath60 and it is invariant with respect to the substitution @xmath61 , equal to zero for @xmath62 ( uncorrelated states ) and equal to one for @xmath63 ( maximally entangled states ) . in terms of @xmath64 , the probability of success @xmath65 given in eq .",
    "( [ psucc ] ) becomes @xmath66 . in fig.[probsucc",
    "] we plot the graph of @xmath65 versus the parameter of entanglement @xmath67 .",
    "plot of the probability @xmath65 to obtain entangled two - photons binomial states in function of the parameter of entanglement @xmath68.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the probability of success to obtain maximally entangled 2gbss , when @xmath69 , has its minimum value @xmath70 and it tends to one when @xmath71 , i.e. when the degree of entanglement @xmath64 tends to zero .",
    "the probability of success is equal to one for @xmath72 , but in this case , with @xmath73 , there is no entanglement at all .",
    "as remarked , the state @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( [ entbin2 ] ) represents entangled two - photons generalized binomial states .",
    "however , when the probabilities of a single photon occurrence @xmath74 ( @xmath26 ) take their limit values @xmath75 , the state @xmath58 reduces to entangled number states with zero or two photons inside the cavities .",
    "in fact , using the property that a binomial state with a maximum number of photons @xmath76 is equal to @xmath77 for @xmath78 and to @xmath79 for @xmath80 @xcite , from eq .",

    "a necessary condition required by this scheme is that the atoms cross the cavities for a predeterminate time @xmath82 .",
    "the experimental uncertainties on selected velocity and interaction time , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are such that @xmath85 . in current laboratory experiments we have @xmath86 or less @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to see that the error @xmath87 of eq .",
    "( [ sinap ] ) is much smaller than the error induced by these experimental values of @xmath88 on the condition @xmath89 .",
    "another aspect we have ignored is the atomic or photon decay during the atom - cavity interactions .",
    "this assumption is valid if @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are the atomic and photon mean lifetimes respectively and @xmath82 is the interaction time . for rydberg atomic levels and microwave superconducting cavities with quality factor @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 and @xmath94 . since typical atom - cavity field interaction times are @xmath95 , the required condition on the mean lifetimes can be satisfied @xcite .",
    "moreover , the typical mean lifetimes of the rydberg atomic levels @xmath96 must be such that the atoms do not decay during the entire sequence of the scheme and , since the proposed scheme requires that the cavities are initially prepared in entangled one - photon generalized binomial states @xcite , the photon mean lifetimes @xmath97 must be long enough to permit cavity fields not to decay before they interact with the successive atoms @xcite .",
    "finally , we should consider the fact that experimental detectors efficiencies are smaller than one , so we could have no `` click '' when an atom crosses the field ionization detector : in this case the generation scheme should be repeated from the beginning .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a conditional scheme for the generation of entangled two - photons generalized binomial states in two spatially separate single - mode high-@xmath0 cavities .",
    "this scheme exploits standard atom - cavity interactions and requires the final measurement of the atomic states .",
    "the probability of success to generate our target state is always larger than or equal to @xmath1 , depending on the value of the parameter of entanglement @xmath67 and therefore on the degree of entanglement @xmath64 . in particular",
    ", we have seen that the probability of success to obtain maximally entangled two - photons binomial states , i.e. when @xmath69 , takes its minimum value @xmath70 and it tends to one when @xmath64 tends to zero .",
    "finally , we have briefly estimated the typical experimental errors involved in such cqed systems , and we have seen that our generation scheme is not sensibly affected by these errors .",
    "this shows that the implementation of our generation scheme is within the current experimental technics @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , the scheme proposed here for the generation of entangled two - photons generalized binomial states in two separate cavities represents the first example , in the context of the cqed , of a scheme that permits to produce entanglement between non - classical states of the electromagnetic field having non zero mean fields and a number of photons greater than one . in conclusion , this kind of entangled state could be useful for fundamental investigations on nonlocal properties , for studying field correlations between the cavities or bell s inequality violations , and for applications in quantum computation and information processing",
