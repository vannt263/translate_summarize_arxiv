    "the interest in some types of supersinglets is not new .",
    "for instance , the two - particle @xmath2-level supersinglets @xmath21 attracted some attention in connection with violations of bell s inequalities for systems of two spin-@xmath22 particles @xcite .",

    "the scenario for the _ @xmath1 strangers problem _ ( nsp ) is an extension to a high number @xmath1 of players of the situation described in patricia highsmith s novel @xcite and alfred hitchcock s movie @xcite _ strangers on a train _ : @xmath1 complete strangers @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) meet on a train .",

    "if the distribution of victims is the result of a secret lottery , how could the murderers be assured that the lottery was not rigged and that nobody had contrived the result or could ascertain it ?    in more general , noncriminal , terms",
    "the @xmath1 strangers problem can be reformulated as follows : each of @xmath1 parties must perform one among @xmath1 different tasks which they do not want to perform themselves . however , each party volunteers to perform some other party s task .",
    "the problem is then how to distribute the victims / tasks @xmath56 among the murderers / volunteers @xmath57 , which share no previous secret information nor any secure classical channel , in a way that guarantees that each murderer / volunteer @xmath52 knows only the identity of his / her victim / task and that nobody else ( besides the murderers / volunteers ) knows anything about the victim / task assignments .",
    "the _ secret sharing problem _ ( ssp ) was already described , for @xmath58 , in @xcite .",
    "it could arise in the following context : @xmath59 wants to have a secret action taken on her behalf at a distant location .",
    "there she has @xmath60 agents , @xmath61 , @xmath62 ,  , @xmath63 who carry it out for her .",
    "@xmath59 knows that some of them are dishonest , but she does not know which ones .",
    "she can not simply send a secure message to all of them , because the dishonest ones will try to sabotage the action , but it is assumed ( as in @xcite ) that if all of them carry it out together , the honest ones will keep the dishonest ones from doing any damage .",
    "the problem is then that @xmath59 wishes to convey a cryptographic key to @xmath61 , @xmath62 , ",
    ", @xmath63 in such a way that none of them can read it on their own , only if all the @xmath52 ( @xmath64 ) collaborate .",
    "in addition , they wish to prevent any eavesdropper from acquiring information without being detected .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath59 shares no previous secret information nor any secure classical channel with her agents .",
    "different quantum solutions to this problem for @xmath58 has been proposed using either ghz @xcite or bell states @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "below we shall propose a different solution for any @xmath1 .",
    "the _ liar detection problem _ ( ldp ) occurs in the following scenario : three parties @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are connected by secure pairwise classical channels .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath65 sends a message @xmath68 to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and @xmath66 sends the same message to @xmath67 .",
    "if both @xmath65 and @xmath66 are honest , then @xmath67 should receive the same @xmath68 from @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , @xmath65 could be dishonest and send different messages to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath69 , or , alternatively , @xmath66 could be dishonest and send a message which is different from the one he receives , @xmath70 .",
    "for @xmath67 the problem is to ascertain without any doubt who is being dishonest .",
    "this problem is interesting for classical information distribution in pairwise connected networks .",
    "the message could be a database and the dishonest behavior a consequence of an error during the copying or distribution process .",
    "in this section i shall explain in which sense each of the three problems introduced in section  [ sec:2 ] have no classical solution .",
    "i will furthermore offer proofs of the impossibility of the existence of that kind of solutions .    in peres book @xcite ( p.  293 )",
    ", the _ key distribution problem _ ( kdp ) is defined as follows : `` the problem (  ) is how to distribute a cryptographic key ( a secret sequence of bits ) to several observers who initially share no secret information , by using an insecure communication channel subject to inspection by a hostile eavesdropper .",
    "if only classical means are used , this is an impossible task .",
    "quantum phenomena , on the other hand , provide various solutions .",
    "the reason for this difference is that information stored in classical form (  ) can be examined objectively without altering it in any detectable way , let alone destroying it , while it is impossible to do that with quantized information encoded in unknown non - orthogonal states . ''    in this definition , trusted couriers , clandestine meetings or private secure communication links between the parties are not allowed .",
    "it is in this scenario  namely , one in which previous secret information and secure communication channels between all parties ( in the nsp ) or between @xmath59 and her agents ( in the ssp ) are not allowed , but public classical channels which can not be altered are assumed  in which the first two problems ( nsp and ssp ) have no classical solution .",
    "a proof follows .",
    "the kdp between two parties has no classical solution .    _",
    "proof : _ information stored in classical form can be examined objectively without altering it in any detectable way , _",
    ". _    the nsp has no classical solution .    _",
    "proof : _ suppose the nsp had a classical solution for some @xmath71 . then , @xmath72 parties could publicly announce the names of their victims and then the remaining two parties would have a way to solve the kdp ( for instance , by publicly assigning 0 and 1 to the remaining two victims and agreeing to define the corresponding entry of the key as the bit value assigned to the victim of one of the two parties ) , _ q.e.d . _",
    "the ssp has no classical solution .    _",
    "proof : _ suppose the ssp had a classical solution for some @xmath73 ( if @xmath74 , then the ssp is the kdp ) .",
    "such a solution must work even when all of @xmath59 s agents are honest . in this case",
    ", @xmath72 agents could publicly collaborate and share the result of such a collaboration with the remaining agent .",
    "then @xmath59 and the remaining agent would have a way to solve the kdp , _",
    "q.e.d . _ + the scenario of the third problem , the ldp , is different .",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are now connected by pairwise classical channels .",
    "these channels must be secure . in this scenario ",
    "namely , one in which previous secret information is not allowed , but secure pairwise classical channels are assumed , the ldp has no classical solution . in order to prove this , we need some previous results .",
    "the _ byzantine generals problem _ ( bgp ) is defined @xcite as follows : a commanding general must send an order to his @xmath60 lieutenant generals such that : ( ic1 ) all loyal lieutenant generals obey the same order .",
    "( ic2 ) if the commanding general is loyal , then every loyal lieutenant general obeys the order he sends .",
    "( ic1 ) and ( ic2 ) are known as the interactive consistency conditions .",
    "note that if the commanding general is loyal , ( ic1 ) follows from ( ic2 ) .",
    "however , the commanding general may be a traitor .",
    "the bgp for @xmath58 generals and @xmath75 traitor has no classical solution .",
    "_ proof _ @xcite ( p.  384 ) : for simplicity , we consider the case in which the only possible orders are `` attack '' or `` retreat '' .",
    "let us first examine the scenario in which the commanding general is loyal and sends an `` attack '' order , but lieutenant general  2 is a traitor and reports to lieutenant general  1 that he received a `` retreat '' order .",
    "for ( ic2 ) to be satisfied , lieutenant general  1 must obey the order to attack . now",
    "consider another scenario in which the commanding general is a traitor and sends an `` attack '' order to lieutenant general  1 and a `` retreat '' order to lieutenant general  2 .",
    "lieutenant general  1 does not know who the traitor is , and he can not tell what message the commanding general actually sent to lieutenant general  2 . hence , the scenarios in these two cases appear exactly the same to lieutenant general  1 . if the traitor lies consistently , then there is no way for lieutenant general  1 to distinguish between these two situations , so he must obey the `` attack '' order in both of them .",
    "hence , whenever lieutenant general  1 receives an `` attack '' order from the commanding general , he must obey it , _",
    "q.e.d . _ + for a more rigorous proof , see @xcite .",
    "no solution for the bgp for @xmath76 generals can cope with @xmath77 traitors .    _ proof : _ the bgp for @xmath78 generals and @xmath77 traitors can be reduced to the bgp for @xmath58 generals and @xmath79 traitor , with each of the generals simulating at most @xmath77 lieutenants and taking the same decision as the loyal lieutenants they simulate , _",
    "q.e.d . _ + a solution for the bgp for @xmath80 and up to @xmath77 traitors",

    "the ldp described in section  [ sec:2 ] is simplification of the bgp for @xmath58 and @xmath79 .",
    "the ldp has no classical solution .    _",
    "proof : _ supposing that the ldp had a classical solution , then the bgp for @xmath58 and @xmath79 had classical solution , _",
    "in this section i will show that all three problems introduced in section  [ sec:2 ] can be solved if each of the @xmath1 participants are in possession of a sequence of numbers with the following properties :    * it is _ random _",

    "are described in the following subsections .",
    "each victim @xmath54 is assigned a label , taken from @xmath81 to @xmath60 .",

    "the remaining entries of the sequence can be used for subsequent rounds .",
    "the result tells every murderer who his / her victim is in such a way that prevents any murderer ( or even a small group of them ) from denouncing or blackmailing another .",
    "the only way to ascertain with certainty who murdered @xmath85 is that all the other murderers confess .",
    "@xmath52 has a probability of @xmath86 to have to kill his / her own desired victim @xmath54 . in case",
    "@xmath52 must kill @xmath54 , since the fact that @xmath52 wants @xmath54 dead is presumably known by others , the best thing @xmath52 could do is to participate in another round with a different set of strangers .",
    "the key is defined as @xmath59 s sequence . the only way to reveal it is to make the remaining @xmath60 parties share their respective sequences ;",
    "the key is then composed by the missing results .",
    "if a dishonest party @xmath87 declares a result which is different to his / her actual result , then there is a probability @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the number of honest parties which have not yet declared their results , that other honest party @xmath90 has obtained that result",
    ". then @xmath90 would stop the process , so alice s key ( and thus alice s action ) would remain safe ( dishonest parties can not sabotage alice s action if they do not know what it is ) .",
    "the order in which the agents declare their respective results must change from round to round to avoid any dishonest party being always the last to declare .      before entering into the details of the solution",

    "finally , @xmath66 must send @xmath67 a message @xmath97 and two lists : @xmath98 and @xmath91.,width=309 ]    let us suppose that the message @xmath68 is a trit value @xmath81 , @xmath75 , or @xmath99 .",
    "all three parties agree to use the following protocol :    * if the transmitted message is @xmath100 , then the sender @xmath82 must also send @xmath83 the list @xmath101 of positions in his / her sequence in which the number @xmath100 appears ( see figure  [ liard ] ) . note that if the sequences are random and long enough then any @xmath101 must contain about one third of the total length @xmath102 of the sequences .",
    "* the receiver @xmath83 would not accept any message if the intersection between the received list @xmath101 and his / her list @xmath103 is not null nor if @xmath104 elements .",
    "we will assume that requirements ( i ) and ( ii ) force the dishonest party to send correct but perhaps incomplete lists .",

    "however , the length of @xmath110 is about @xmath112 , while @xmath67 is expecting @xmath66 to send her two lists with a total length of @xmath113 ; then @xmath67 would conclude that @xmath66 was being dishonest .",
    "alternatively , if it is @xmath65 who is being dishonest , the length of the two lists that @xmath67 received from @xmath66 would total about @xmath113 ; @xmath67 would then conclude that @xmath65 was being dishonest .      a possible quantum method to generate sequences of numbers with properties ( i ) to ( iv ) among @xmath1 distant parties",
    "is by distributing among all @xmath1 parties an @xmath1-particle @xmath1-level supersinglet @xmath3 described in  ( [ snsn ] ) .",
    "once the particles have been distributed among the parties , a direction of measurement is randomly chosen and publicly announced . due to the @xmath1-lateral rotational invariance of the @xmath3 states ,",
    "whenever the @xmath1 parties measure the spin of the @xmath1 separated particles along this direction , each of them finds a different result in the set @xmath114 ; thus such results satisfy requirements  ( ii ) and  ( iii ) .    in order to accomplish requirements ( i ) ,",
    "( iv ) , and ( v ) , an essential property is _ nonseparability _ , that is , the quantum predictions for the @xmath3 states can not be reproduced by any local hidden variables model in which the results of the spin measurements are somehow determined before the measurement . to show the nonseparability of @xmath3 we have to study whether they violate bell s inequalities derived from the assumptions of local realism .",
    "most bell s inequalities require two alternative local dichotomic ( taking values @xmath115 or @xmath75 ) observables @xmath116 and @xmath85 on each particle @xmath83 . to test nonseparability",
    ", we will use the dichotomic local observables proposed by peres in @xcite .",
    "a peres observable @xmath117 can be operationally defined as follows : to measure @xmath117 , first measure the spin component of particle @xmath84 along direction @xmath65 , @xmath118 .",

    ", information is stored in the quantum state of quantum systems , usually qubits .",
    "preserving the desired states of the qubits and controlling their evolution is essential for most of the tasks .",
    "however , when the qubits interact with the environment , although the overall evolution of the state of the qubits - environment system is unitary ( according to quantum mechanics , the evolution of the state of any closed system is unitary ) , the evolution of the state of the qubits alone ( which do not form a closed system ) is not unitary .",
    "the state of the qubits rapidly evolves into a state which is entangled with the environment .",

    "such an assumption is justified as long as the qubits have very close positions with respect to the bath coherence length .",
    "then , it has been shown that , for @xmath1 even , the @xmath4 states are eigenstates of the whole hamiltonian of the qubits - bath system and also eigenstates of the interaction hamiltonian with eigenvalue zero ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath4 states are @xmath1-lateral unitary invariant .",
    "this means that , if we act on any of them with the tensor product of @xmath1 equal unitary operators , the result will be to reproduce the same state : @xmath154 @xmath155 being @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is an unitary operator @xcite .",
    "in addition , any ( coherent or incoherent ) superposition of @xmath1-lateral unitary invariant states is also @xmath1-lateral unitary invariant .",
    "therefore , for arbitrary @xmath1 ( even ) , the @xmath158 states with @xmath83 ranging from 2 to @xmath1 ( and tensor products thereof ) span a @xmath159-dimensional df subspace .",
    "let us call this subspace @xmath160 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath160 is given @xcite by @xmath161 the number of qubits encoded in @xmath160 is @xmath162 . for large @xmath1 , @xmath163 therefore , the encoding efficiency , defined as @xmath164 is asymptotically _",
