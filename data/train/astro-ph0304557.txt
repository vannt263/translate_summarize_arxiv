    "this paper has three main objectives .",
    "the first is to develop a framework of equations and boundary conditions with general validity for magnetic rotator winds and disks in hot stars .",
    "the second is to determine the conditions under which keplerian disk regions may be formed .",
    "the third is to develop models to explain the formation and properties of keplerian disk regions . in a future paper",
    "we intend to consider applications to wind compressed disk(wcd ) regions .",
    "earlier studies of magnetic rotator winds , such as the one due to @xcite , focussed on one - dimensional models involving equatorial winds mainly to consider magnetic braking .",
    "@xcite set up a system of equations for axially symmetric stars with dipole fields .",
    "his equations were based on the solutions obtained by @xcite for steady state magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) systems . @xcite developed a numerical method for two - dimensional magnetic rotator winds using the weber - davis approach .",
    "there have been several other studies of equatorial and non - equatorial winds and flows in the context of disk formation , and a review of such work is given in a recent paper by @xcite in which a magnetically torqued disk ( mtd ) model was proposed to explain the be star phenomenon .",
    "an important difference between the mtd model and our models is that we consider weaker magnetic fields that are sufficient to provide the torque required to sustain higher rotation rates in the flows towards the disk region , whereas the fields discussed in the mtd paper are strong fields required to spin up the disk .",
    "since the disk material is much denser than the the pre - shock flow material , the fields required in the mtd model are stronger than the fields required in our models .    over the past decade ,",
    "several models have been developed to explain the formation of disks and equatorial density enhancements around rapidly rotating stars .",
    "the idea of wind compressed disks in nonmagnetic stars was developed by @xcite and the concept of wind compressed zones ( wcz ) was presented by @xcite . in the wcd model , trajectories of supersonic flow material from a rotating star travel to the equatorial plane . after the matter enters the disk region to form a wcd it continues to flow outwards . however , the angular speed of this material is far below the keplerian orbital speed .",
    "an important similarity between the wcd model and the magnetically channeled model is that the flow passes through a compression shock which leads to a significant enhancement of the density in the equatorial region .",
    "the wcz model is a milder version of the wcd model and does not involve a magnetic field . because it applies to stars that are rotating too slowly to form wcd structures ,",
    "the wcz model does not have a shock - compressed disk region and the enhancement of density is less than in the wcd model .",
    "the wcz idea has been modified by @xcite to include the effects of a weak magnetic field .",
    "it is called the wcfields model . in this model ,",
    "the magnetic fields are unimportant in accelerating the flow but an enhancement of the field near the equatorial plane occurs through compression of field lines . the wcfields model may be relevant in discussing the flow in the equatorial region beyond and above the disk in magnetic rotator models .",
    "@xcite developed a magnetically confined wind - shock ( mcws ) model to explain properties of ap and bp stars . in this model , a strong dipole magnetic field channels",
    "the flow of wind from an early type star to form a disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have applied the mcws model to hot stars in which observational data have been interpreted to indicate the presence of dipole magnetic fields with strengths in the range from 300 to 400 g and with significant obliquity .",
    "unfortunately , these papers neglected the contribution of rapid rotation to the dynamics of the wind .",
    "the hot stars of interest to us , especially be - type , are known to be extremely fast rotators and the effect of rotation on the dynamics of the wind will be more significant than that of the magnetic field .",
    "the mtd model addressed the question of disks in fast rotators with strong magnetic fields .",
    "several phases in the development of disks around be stars have been revealed by long term observational studies of these objects .",
    "disks can form and disappear on time scales of about 30 years .",
    "when the disks of be stars achieve a certain mass , as estimated by the equivalent width of the @xmath10 emission line , the stars tend to develop the observational phenomenon of @xmath11 variations . during the @xmath11 variation phase the star displays a modification in which the @xmath12 component periodically changes so as to appear stronger and weaker relative to the @xmath9 component .",
    "the @xmath11 phenomenon has a typical time scale of about 7 years , which has been interpreted by @xcite and others as the orbital period of a one - armed spiral pattern and is typically much longer than the orbital time of matter in the disk region around the star .    in section [ wind - zones ] , we discuss the spatial features of flow regions or wind zones in our models . in sections",
    "[ equations ] and [ alfven - azimuthal ] we set up systems of equations that can be used to study properties of flows and winds in rotating stellar models with magnetic fields .",
    "the models have axial symmetry and are in a steady state . in a general study of",
    "magnetic rotator winds it would be necessary to consider details of the magnetic field over the entire stellar surface . if the objective is restricted to studying the formation of disks , we need to consider magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong only over a smaller localized sector of the stellar surface through which flux tubes emerge from the interior .",
    "in section [ jump - conditions ] we set up jump conditions that must be satisfied across the shock boundary between a flow region and a disk region .",
    "we establish an important theorem in section [ rotn - theorem ] connecting the angular velocity of a disk region in which there is no meridional motion with the angular velocity at the photosphere . in section [ condn - for - pre - kepl - disk ]",
    "we consider conditions that must be satisfied during the fill - up stage in a disk region with no meridional motion and we derive a necessary condition for the formation of a keplerian disk . in section [ disk - eqns ]",
    "we set up equations that govern the structure of a disk region in a steady state . in section",
    "[ rotation - of - disk - region ] we discuss the rotation of disk regions during the fill - up stage and , also , the extent of keplerian regions after a quasi - steady state has been reached .",
    "we consider two processes in the formation of keplerian disk regions .",
    "these are a fill - up process and a process of adjustment of disk material with super - keplerian rotation speeds into keplerian orbits .",
    "we use the term quasi - steady keplerian disk to describe a disk region that is formed after the processes of fill - up and adjustment into keplerian orbits . we study models in which it is reasonable to consider the processes separately and we discuss this in sections [ rotation - of - disk - region ] , [ results ] and [ discussion ] .",
    "several authors @xcite have suggested that viscous stresses play an important role in the structure and properties of disks .",
    "we assume that viscous forces are not important during the fill - up stage .",
    "in section [ mag - fld - constraints ] we discuss some constraints on the magnetic field and in section [ mag - fld - models ] we develop a prescription for a stream function and the corresponding dipole - type magnetic field configurations that enable us to study disk formation . we discuss further details of our models and develop a method of solution in section [ models ] .",
    "we present our results in section [ results ] .",
    "conclusions and possible interpretation of observations are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider the flow of matter away from the stellar surface caused by traditional wind driving processes . while most of the flow from higher latitudes will travel to large distances away from the star in the form of a wind ,",
    "material from lower latitudes can flow into equatorial disk regions or even flow back onto the star . in order to simplify terminology , we to refer to any flow region surrounding the star other than a disk region as a _",
    "wind zone_. this includes a region in which matter flows to a disk region or back towards the stellar surface .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a schematic drawing of a meridional cross - section of the different wind zones and , also , the disk region during the fill - up stage . in each hemisphere of our models",
    ", we consider three wind zones .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the wind zone in which the matter flows into the disk region .",
    "@xmath14 is the wind zone in which material actually leaves the stellar environment in the form of a wind .",
    "a third zone that may be present is @xmath15 where matter flows towards the equatorial plane and then back towards the stellar surface .",
    "when disks are present , we consider models with a single contiguous disk region @xmath16 .",
    "we denote the photosphere by @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 , which we call the _ initial surface _ , be a surface close to the the photosphere on which initial conditions for the flow in the wind zones are specified .",
    "we can take @xmath18 to be the sonic surface or some other appropriate surface .",
    "quantities associated with the photosphere and the initial surface are denoted by subscripts @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we identify different sectors of the photosphere and the initial surface that are linked to the different wind zones . at higher latitudes",
    ", we have the the sector @xmath21 of the initial surface from which material flows through the wind zone @xmath14 along open streamlines to a large distance from the star .",
    "the meridional speed of the flow in this zone reaches the meridional alfvn velocity at some distance from the star and exceeds this value at points beyond the alfvn distance so that the magnetic field lines are drawn out by the flow .",
    "the sector of the photosphere that is associated with @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 .",
    "the flow from the sector @xmath23 of the initial surface travels through the wind zone @xmath13 and passes through a shock surface @xmath24 to supply material to the disk region @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the sector of the photosphere that is linked to the sector @xmath26 by the magnetic field . if a third wind zone @xmath15 exists such that initially the flow is towards the equatorial plane and then back towards the surface , we take @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be the sectors of the initial surface and photosphere that are associated with @xmath15 . if the sector @xmath28 is present , it would be the closest to the equator .",
    "this zone does not play any significant role in our models .",
    "the meridional speed of the flow at all points in the regions @xmath15 and @xmath13 is less than the meridional alfvn speed so that the magnetic field is able to influence the flow in theses zones .",
    "although we separate the flow into different zones , the basic equations that we set up in sections [ equations ] and [ alfven - azimuthal ] of this paper are valid for all flow regions or wind zones .",
    "an important feature in our models is the meridional streamline between the wind zones @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "we use the term _ limiting streamline _ to refer to this streamline , which separates the flow entering the disk region from the wind flow to large distances from the star . during the fill - up stage , the shock boundary , @xmath24 , between the zone @xmath13 and the disk region @xmath16 does not extend outwards beyond the limiting streamline . after the fill - up stage ,",
    "the material in the disk region with super - keplerian rotation speed diffuses out until a quasi - steady region is formed .",
    "the outer boundary of the quasi - steady disk region may extend beyond the limiting streamline and , if this happens , we assume that the wind material in the region @xmath14 flows outside the extended disk region .",
    "we assume that , in addition to axial symmetry , streamlines of the flow and magnetic field lines have equatorial symmetry .",
    "therefore , we need to set up our equations only in the _ northern hemisphere _ , which is determined by the direction of the angular momentum vector .",
    "equatorial symmetry together with appropriate changes in sign , where necessary , will yield the values of quantities and flow patterns in the southern hemisphere . in models with surface magnetic fields that have predominantly dipole - type structure we may assume , without loss of generality , that the field and the flow in the northern hemisphere are in the same direction and in opposite directions in the southern hemisphere .",
    "in this section , we set up equations that are valid for the material in all flow regions , or wind zones .",
    "we assume that the flow is steady , which is reasonable when all other phenomena of interest in the wind zones have time scales that are longer than the characteristic time of the flow .",
    "we consider a rotating hot star with a magnetic field .",
    "the star has mass @xmath29 , luminosity @xmath30 , equatorial radius @xmath9 and effective temperature @xmath31 . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that the star is approximately spherical and that the system is axially and equatorially symmetric .",
    "we use a stationary , inertial frame of reference with spherical polar coordinates @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 be unit vectors in the @xmath36- , @xmath37- and @xmath38- directions .",
    "subscripts @xmath39 and @xmath38 denote meridional and azimuthal components of vectors .",
    "the velocity and magnetic field can be written in the form @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath42 and @xmath2 denote the magnitudes of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath2 are always positive because they are the magnitudes of vectors .",
    "however , @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be positive or negative because they are the @xmath38-components of the vectors .",
    "the density @xmath47 and the velocity @xmath48 of the flow material satisfy the continuity condition @xmath49 the divergence - free condition for the magnetic field is @xmath50 and the steady state mhd induction equation for material with extremely high electrical conductivity is @xmath51 @xcite and @xcite have obtained useful integrals of these differential equations . in an axially symmetric system",
    ", the azimuthal component of equation ( [ curl - vxb ] ) requires that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a scalar function of position .",
    "equation ( [ vm - bm ] ) shows that the meridional field lines coincide with the meridional streamlines .",
    "also , equations ( [ curl - vxb ] ) and ( [ vm - bm ] ) give us @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a constant along a meridional streamline line .",
    "we interpret @xmath55 to be the constant angular velocity of the magnetic field line passing through the point @xmath56 at the initial surface .",
    "thus , if we picture the magnetic field line as being anchored at the point @xmath1 of the photosphere , then @xmath55 is the angular velocity of the star at @xmath1 .",
    "equations ( [ vm - bm ] ) and ( [ v - phi-1 ] ) can be combined to give @xmath57 equations ( [ div - rho - v ] ) , ( [ div - b ] ) and ( [ vm - bm ] ) require that the quantity defined by @xmath58 must be constant along a meridional streamline in a hemisphere .",
    "this constant for a meridional streamline can be written @xmath59 note that @xmath60 when @xmath61 and @xmath62 are in the same direction and @xmath63 when they are in opposite directions . in section [ azimuthal - wind - props ]",
    "we discuss properties of @xmath45 and @xmath46 and show that the quantity @xmath64 is negative in both hemispheres .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ v - phi-1 ] ) implies that , relative to a stationary frame of reference , the rotational velocity @xmath45 of a flow particle moving along a field line is less than the co - rotation velocity @xmath65 .",
    "if we consider points on a streamline through the point @xmath66 on the initial surface , equation ( [ xi - eqn ] ) gives @xmath67 where subscript @xmath20 refers to values at @xmath56 .",
    "equation ( [ vm - bm ] ) has important consequences for modeling stellar winds and disks .",
    "first , consider a star in which the dominant component of the surface magnetic field is an odd spherical harmonic , such as a dipole - type field . in both hemispheres",
    ", material flows outwards from the stellar surface while the the magnetic field is directed outwards in one hemisphere and inwards in the other .",
    "thus , @xmath68 must have opposite signs in opposite hemispheres .",
    "this raises the question of continuity of field lines across the equatorial plane .",
    "we resolve this by noting that there are two possible scenarios for the flow of material close to the equatorial plane . in one of these",
    ", opposing flows from the different hemispheres will cross a shock surface and form a disk in which the radial velocity is zero or negligible . here , shock conditions will account for the discontinuity in @xmath68 . in this paper , we consider models where this condition prevails . in the other scenario with a dipole - type field at the surface , the flow near the equatorial plane is deflected parallel to the plane and we do not have to consider the continuity of @xmath68 across the plane . if the flow crosses a shock surface before moving parallel to the equatorial plane we expect a wcd region to be formed . in both scenarios , the flow near the equatorial plane in the region @xmath14 , outside the limiting streamline ,",
    "will be almost parallel to the plane so that corresponding streamlines in opposite hemispheres are not connected .",
    "part of this flow may form a wcz . in the case of a star with a magnetic field",
    "in which the dominant component at the initial surface is an even spherical harmonic , such as due to a quadrupole field , the field lines near the equatorial plane in the different hemispheres will be parallel to the plane and the question of the continuity of @xmath68 does not arise .",
    "the general form of the steady state equation of motion for the flow of matter is , in the usual notation , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the ratio of the stellar luminosity to the eddington luminosity and @xmath71 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the term involving @xmath72 gives the force due to continuum radiation written as a fraction of local gravity .",
    "the force due to line radiation is @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is given by the usual cak expression @xcite .",
    "we assume that the pressure is given by the isothermal equation of state @xmath75 which is a reasonable approximation for the wind zones and the disk . here",
    ", @xmath76 is the isothermal speed of sound .",
    "if we apply the continuity condition ( [ div - rho - v ] ) to the left hand side of the @xmath38-component of equation ( [ momentum - eqn1 ] ) , and then multiply both sides by @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 the right hand side of this equation represents the torque exerted by the magnetic force on the flow material .",
    "this equation gives the integral @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a constant along a meridional streamline .",
    "we interpret @xmath80 to be the total angular momentum per unit mass at points along the streamline .    in general",
    ", the line radiation force , @xmath81 , given by the cak expression is not conservative . in models where this force is important , in order to obtain an energy equation we would have to find a suitably defined potential function whose gradient will be approximately equal to @xmath81 . since our primary interest is in understanding the effects of magnetic fields , we consider models in which the line radiation force is negligible and we set @xmath82 .",
    "this is a valid approximation in the case of late be stars @xcite .",
    "we can write equation ( [ momentum - eqn1 ] ) in the form @xmath83 = \\rho \\ , \\mathbf{v}\\bcross \\left(\\bnabla \\bcross \\mathbf{v}\\right ) + \\frac{{\\rm curl } \\ , \\mathbf{b } \\bcross \\mathbf{b}}{4\\pi } \\,.\\ ] ] we take the scalar product of this equation with @xmath48 and use equations ( [ v - total ] ) and ( [ phi - eqn1 ] ) to obtain the bernoulli equation @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant along a meridional streamline and has dimension of energy per unit mass .",
    "the term @xmath86 expresses the work done by the magnetic torque on the flow material .",
    "if we move this term to the right hand side of the equation and compare the new equation with the corresponding equation for a nonmagnetic system , we see that the energy of the flow material is increased by the work done by the magnetic field . only the azimuthal component of the magnetic force does work on the material and supplies energy to it .",
    "this is because the flow velocity , given by equation ( [ v - total ] ) , is the sum of a vector parallel to @xmath87 and another in the azimuthal direction while the magnetic force is perpendicular to @xmath87 .",
    "our equations give us the set @xmath88 of streamline constants for the flow of material in the wind zones .",
    "here , @xmath89 is the ratio of the meridional mass flux density to the meridional magnetic flux density and @xmath55 is the angular velocity of a flux tube associated with a streamline .",
    "also , @xmath80 is the total angular momentum per unit mass and @xmath85 represents an energy per unit mass and is not the total energy per unit mass of the flow material .",
    "since the magnetic field plays an important role in determining the nature of the flow , it is useful to compare the flow velocity with the alfvn velocity of the magnetic field , which is given in vector form by @xmath90 .",
    "we introduce the quantities @xmath91 note that @xmath92 is always positive but @xmath93 can be positive or negative depending on the sign of @xmath46 .",
    "also , @xmath92 and @xmath94 are , respectively , the reciprocals of the meridional and azimuthal alfvn mach numbers .",
    "streamlines flowing through the wind zone @xmath14 are associated with the material flowing away to large distances and are characterized by the presence of an alfvn point , @xmath95 , at which @xmath42 equals the meridional component of the alfvn velocity .",
    "let subscript @xmath96 denote quantities at @xmath95 .",
    "then , we have @xmath97 which satisfies the condition that @xmath98 .",
    "equations ( [ vm - bm-1 ] ) and ( [ alfven - point ] ) combine to yield @xmath99 which is the density at the alfvn point on an open streamline and is determined by the conditions at the initial surface .    in the wind zones @xmath13 and @xmath15 , the magnetic field is strong enough such the condition @xmath100 is satisfied at all points in these zones .",
    "that is , the meridional component of the flow velocity is sub - alfvnic in these zones . on the other hand , for a streamline in the wind zone @xmath14 that emerges from the point @xmath56 on @xmath21 , we have @xmath101 at all points between @xmath56 and @xmath95 , and @xmath102 for all points beyond @xmath95 . the limiting streamline that separates the wind zones @xmath14 and",
    "@xmath13 is the first meridional streamline above the equator that contains an alfvn point .",
    "assuming that the system is equatorially symmetric , the alfvn point on the limiting streamline will be on the equatorial plane .    for streamlines in all wind zones ,",
    "we define two quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which are constants for a given streamline but can be different for different streamlines . the first is given by the equation @xmath105 this may be interpreted as the characteristic density associated with a streamline .",

    "if the sector @xmath268 of the photosphere rotates with approximately uniform angular velocity and is linked to a pre - keplerian disk region by a dipole - type magnetic field of sufficient strength , then during the fill - up stage the disk region will have the same uniform angular velocity . in section [ condn - for - pre - kepl - disk ]",
    "we derive a necessary condition for the formation of a keplerian disk .",
    "it requires that the normal component of the flow velocity near the shock boundary must be sufficiently large for keplerian disks to form when a magnetic field is present and when the rotation rate is high .",
    "this constraint results from the fact that magnetic pressure in the disk region plays a role in inhibiting keplerian disk formation even when the magnetic force is small compared with gravity or centrifugal force .",
    "our models require modest magnetic fields such that the meridional alfvn speeds are larger than the speeds of the outflow in the wind zone @xmath13 between the stellar surface and the shock surface .",
    "several authors @xcite have referred to observational evidence for the presence of surface magnetic fields in hot stars with strengths of several hundred gauss .",
    "we know that fossil fields can be present in radiative envelopes of early type stars . @xcite gives the ohmic decay time for a stellar field with length scale @xmath407 and appropriate resistivity to be @xmath408 s. if we take @xmath409 , we see that this time is much longer than the evolutionary time for all the stars except for the b9 star . for the b9 star they are of the same order . in the radiative envelopes of the stars , @xmath410 is much larger than @xmath31 and the decay time will be much longer for all the stars .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that magnetic fields may be generated through dynamo action at the core - envelope boundary of a hot star and @xcite have found that such a field can be transported to the surface region in a time shorter than an evolutionary time of the star . in view of the observational evidence and theoretical support it is reasonable for us to consider models with modest surface fields .",
    "our approach to modeling the formation of keplerian disks consists of a disk fill - up process and a process of adjustment of super - keplerian disk material into keplerian orbits .",
    "although the second process may begin during the later stages of the first process , it is reasonable to consider them separately because initially the density in the disk region is small and the magnetic field plays a role in the rotation of the disk material . towards the end of the fill - up stage",
    ", the density of the disk region increases to much larger values and the magnetic force in the disk becomes negligible when compared with centrifugal force or gravity .",
    "this allows the super - keplerian material in the pre - keplerian disk region to move into keplerian orbits while conserving angular momentum when there is no viscous force .",
    "although viscosity is negligible at the end of the fill - up stage , the onset of a weak viscous force during the process of diffusion of super - keplerian material into into keplerian orbits will be helpful .",
    "when the meridional field @xmath351 at the initial surface is only slightly larger than the minimum value @xmath360 that is required for disk formation , the keplerian region will be in the shape of a ring . for increasing values of @xmath351 the radial extent of the keplerian region increases and the region reaches its largest extent when @xmath351 equals the optimal value @xmath361 . for values of @xmath351 larger than @xmath411",
    "there is no increase in the radial extent of the quasi - steady keplerian region .",
    "when the sector @xmath268 of the photosphere has uniform rotation , the inner and outer radii of the maximal quasi - steady keplerian region of the disk are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , where @xmath9 is the stellar radius and @xmath6 is the ratio of the rotational speed to the keplerian speed at @xmath25 . while the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface determines the extent of a quasi - steady keplerian disk region , we see that both the inner and outer radii of a maximal disk are given in terms of @xmath6 .",
    "the inner radius is the distance at which there is corotation with keplerian rotation speed .",
    "the outer radius of the maximal disk is determined by the point where the escape velocity is reached in a pre - keplerian region and it is larger for smaller values of @xmath6 .",
    "our result for the maximal radial extent of a quasi - steady keplerian region of the disk is obtained without including the effect of viscous forces . as shown in table [ table - stars - fmag - fvisc ] , the viscous force in the disk region is negligible at the end of the fill - up stage . if a weak viscous force plays a role during the transition from a pre - keplerian to a quasi - steady kelperian disk region , the radial extent of the quasi - steady region will be slightly different .",
    "there are other situations that we do not discuss here in which quasi - steady keplerian disks of different radial extent can be formed .",
    "for example , if the magnetic field lines from the star to the disk region are confined to a sector @xmath25 such that the rotation speed at the innermost point of the pre - keplerian disk region is super - keplerian , then the inner radius will be larger than @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if the rotation rate and the extent of a keplerian disk region of a star can be obtained from observations , our models can be used to make some deductions about the magnetic field of the star .",
    "the minimum and optimal meridional magnetic fields required for the formation of keplerian disks in models of b - type stars are , respectively , of order 1 g to 10 g. these fields are weaker than @xmath302 , which is the lower bound derived by @xcite for the meridional field at the stellar surface to withstand the effects of meridional circulation . the fill - up times in models of all the different stars that we consider in this paper are shorter than the corresponding circulation times .",
    "thus , although meridional circulation may not affect the formation of disks in b - type stars , its effect on the stellar field can influence some observed properties of disks . on the other hand ,",
    "the situation in regard to o - type stars is different . in models of o6.5 stars , meridional magnetic fields required for keplerian disk formation",
    "are of the order of 100 g , which is of the same order as @xmath302 , and in o3 stars they are about 1000 g , which is much larger than @xmath412 .",
    "although the fill - up times in o - type stars are shorter than the meridional circulation times , if these stars posses the meridional fields with the strengths that are required for keplerian disk formation , circulation may not be involved in causing any observable changes in disks .",
    "our numerical results indicate that for reasonable values of the rotation rate and surface magnetic field strengths , b - type stars are likely to possess keplerian disks .",
    "this is consistent with the results for the distribution of be stars obtained by @xcite .",
    "our models do not require that the meridional field , @xmath351 , be uniformly strong across the stellar surface for the formation of a keplerian disk .",
    "the field must have the required strength on the sector @xmath26 and the rotation should be approximately uniform on the sector @xmath25",
    ". the entire star need not be in uniform rotation .",
    "for all reasonable locations of @xmath25 in all our models , we find that its spread in latitude needs to be only a few degrees .",
    "we should emphasize that the assumption of axial symmetry has been made only to simplify the mathematics .",
    "our model for disk formation does not depend on an aligned dipole field or even an axially symmetric field .",
    "our results will qualitatively apply to oblique rotator models or to stars with magnetic fields consisting of flux loops that emerge from lower latitudes and thread the disk region .",
    "the strengths of the meridional fields required for keplerian disk formation in our models suggest that a possible scenario for the variation with time of properties of keplerian disks in some b - type stars is the following .",
    "these stars possess magnetic fields that are mainly sub - photospheric and from time to time , due to magnetic buoyancy or other interior phenomena , meridional magnetic field lines emerge from the stellar surface . the strength of the meridional component of the field satisfies the condition @xmath413 so that it is able to assist in the formation of keplerian disks . after the formation of a disk",
    ", the meridional field lines are drawn below the stellar surface in a time scale of the order of the circulation time , which is longer than the disk fill - up time , @xmath147 .",
    "this shuts off the supply of magnetically torqued material to the disk from non - equatorial latitudes .",
    "the resurgence and submersion of meridional fields across the stellar surface could explain some of the variations of the disk region over different time scales .",
    "we should emphasize that the theory that we propose for keplerian disk formation does not depend on which theory of meridional circulation speeds is valid .",
    "we consider circulation only as a possible cause of variation of disks with time .",
    "thus , the be star phenomenon may be an interesting example where the effects of rotation , circulation and magnetic activity play a significant role .",
    "obviously , stars in which @xmath414 will not exhibit this aspect of time variation .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the present work to consider details of the time dependent behavior of the surface field caused by rotation , circulation and outflow or the depletion of flux due to instabilities .",
    "obviously , such a study will be greatly beneficial for a better understanding the role of magnetic fields in the formation , properties and variability of disks .    some of the basic goals of this paper are to understand how magnetic fields of rotating stars can influence the formation of keplerian disks and to explain the time variability observed in be stars .",
    "the mtd model of @xcite has the same objectives and the flow regions that we consider in our models are similar to those in the mtd model .",
    "one of the main differences between our models and the mtd model is that we are able to establish a result for the angular velocity distribution during the fill - up stage of a disk .",
    "the mtd model uses an empirical formula for the rotational velocity in the disk region , which may be appropriate in wcd models .",
    "a second difference is that the meridional fields in our models can be weaker than the critical strength , @xmath302 and yet be strong enough to provide the torque required by the flow material to reach rotational speeds that lead to the formation of keplerian disks .",
    "the mtd model requires stronger fields because the torque is applied to the disk and , therefore , their strengths are larger than @xmath302 . as we show in this paper ,",
    "a problem with stronger fields in the disk region is that they can inhibit the formation of a keplerian region .",
    "an important aspect of our models is that for the strengths of fields that we consider , the magnetic force in the disk region becomes negligible at the end of the fill - up stage .",
    "thus , the one - armed spiral pattern of the global disk oscillation model @xcite can be used to explain the v / r variability in disks of be stars .",

    "<S> we set up equations and boundary conditions for magnetic rotator winds and disks in axially symmetric hot stars in a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> we establish a theorem stating that if a disk region has no meridional motion but its magnetic field has a normal component at a point @xmath0 on its shock boundary , the angular velocity of the disk region at @xmath0 is the same as the angular velocity of the star at the point @xmath1 at which the magnetic field line through @xmath0 is anchored . </S>",
    "<S> when there is equatorial symmetry , all points of the disk along the field line through @xmath0 will have the same angular velocity as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> also , we show that for a given value of the magnetic field strength , if the rotation rate is too high or the flow velocity into the shock boundary is too low , a keplerian disk region will not be formed . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the formation of disks in magnetic rotators through the processes of fill - up and diffusion into keplerian orbits . at the end of the fill - up stage the density of the disk increases significantly and </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic force in the disk becomes negligible . </S>",
    "<S> if the meridional component @xmath2 of the field at the surface is larger than a minimum value @xmath3 , a keplerian disk can form . </S>",
    "<S> the radial extent of the keplerian region is larger for larger values of @xmath2 and is largest when @xmath2 equals an optimal value @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the extent does not increase when @xmath2 is larger than @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is the ratio of rotational speed to the critical rotation speed at the photosphere , the inner and outer radii of the maximal quasi - steady keplerian disk region are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , where @xmath9 is the stellar radius . for models with dipole - type fields , the values of @xmath3 in b - type stars are of order 1 g to 10 g and in o - type stars they are about 500 g. because the values of @xmath2 required for disk formation in b - type stars are relatively small and the fill - up time is short , we suggest that meridional circulation may play a role in some of the time - variation observed in disks of be stars through its effect on the magnetic field near the photosphere . </S>"
