    "the term vortex is commonly used to designate a region of concentrated rotation in a flow , such as an eddy , a whirlpool , or the depression at the center of a whirling body of air or water . naturally occurring vortices include hurricanes , tornadoes , waterspouts , and dust devils  @xcite .",
    "yet vortices can also be created in many different media : they manifest in plasmas  @xcite , superfluids  @xcite , ferromagnets  @xcite , acoustical waves  @xcite , quantum hall fluids  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates  @xcite , and electron wave packets  @xcite , to cite only a few relevant examples .",
    "this points to the ubiquity of this phenomenon and reveals a growing interest in these singularities .",
    "the case of optical vortices deserves a special mention  @xcite .",
    "an optical vortex is a beam of light exhibiting a pure screw phase dislocation along the propagation axis ; i.e. , an azimuthal phase dependence @xmath0 . the number @xmath1 plays the role of a topological charge : the phase changes its value in @xmath1 cycles of @xmath2 in any closed circuit about the axis , while the amplitude is zero there .",
    "one of the most interesting properties of vortices is that they carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) : the integer @xmath1 can be seen as the eigenvalue of the oam operator and its sign defines the helicity or direction of rotation .",
    "indeed , the oam of such a field can be easily manipulated and transferred , which opens many experimental perspectives , such as optical tweezers and spanners  @xcite , as well as potential astronomical  @xcite and communication applications  @xcite .",
    "the fact that individual photons also carry oam presents the most exciting possibilities for using this variable in the quantum domain , and a number of uses has already been demonstrated  @xcite .    in quantum theory , the operator representing the oam has an unbounded spectrum that includes positive and negative integers .",
    "accordingly , its conjugate variable , the azimuthal angle , might be expected to be represented by a _ bona fide _ operator .",
    "periodicity , however , brings out subtleties that have triggered long and heated discussions  @xcite .    here",
    ", we look at this issue from a phase - space perspective . such an approach was introduced in the very early days of quantum theory to avoid some of the troubles arising in the abstract hilbert - space formulation . the pioneering works of weyl  @xcite , wigner  @xcite , and moyal  @xcite paved thus the way to formally picturing the quantum world as a statistical theory on phase space  @xcite .    in few words ,",
    "the key idea is to look for a mapping relating operators ( in hilbert space ) to functions ( in phase space ) . for the conjugate pair angle - oam ,",
    "the phase space is the discrete cylinder @xmath3 ( @xmath4 denotes the unit circle associated with the angle , while @xmath5 are the integers labeling oam ) .",
    "it seems natural to work out a wigner function ( or any other quasiprobability ) therein .",
    "a pioneer attempt in that direction was made by mukunda  @xcite ; his work was subsequently reelaborated and developed in a variety of directions by other authors  @xcite .",
    "however , one might properly argue that in such a correct way of proceeding one is overlooking significant information about the transverse distribution .",
    "this means , for example , that , using cylindrical coordinates , all the states @xmath6 represent eigenstates of the angular momentum , irrespective of the form of the amplitudes @xmath7 .",
    "a similar problem arises in the description of spinlike systems over the bloch sphere : one disregards in this way fluctuations in the number of particles , because a sphere of fixed radius can not accommodate those fluctuations . to bypass this drawback",
    "one needs to include the whole bloch space that can be envisioned as foliated in a set of nested spheres with radii proportional to the different number of particules that contribute to the state .",
    "below , we propose an alternative road and derive phase - space distributions via suitable marginals of distributions for field quadratures , once we remove the degrees of freedom irrelevant for the specification of the problem .",
    "the same ideas have been used also to study quantum polarization properties  @xcite .",
    "perhaps , this provides the most down - to - earth approach to the problem at hand , since the quadrature distributions can be determined by very simple experimental procedures  @xcite .",
    "this widespread measurability does not hold for the wigner functions on the cylinder : the proposals for their practical reconstruction are rather cumbersome  @xcite and lack the simple and intuitive picture provided by schemes measuring quadrature distributions .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1dho ] we concisely sketch the phase - space fundamentals for a single harmonic oscillator . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2dho ] we start from two kinematical independent orthogonal oscillators and express the resulting wigner function in cylindrical coordinates . by eliminating an unessential variable ( the radial momentum ) , we get a well - behaved distribution that gives complete information , not only on the pair angle - oam , but also on the radial distribution .",
    "we apply the resulting wigner function to some relevant states in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex ] , and conclude that it constitues a most suitable tool to deal with this problem .",
    "to keep the discussion as self - contained as possible , we first boil down the rudiments of the phase - space formalism for a harmonic oscillator that we shall need later on .",
    "the relevant dynamical observables are the conjugate coordinate and momentum operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with canonical commutation relation ( with @xmath10 throughout ) @xmath11 = i \\ , { \\hat { \\openone } } \\ , , \\ ] ] so that they are the generators of the heisenberg - weyl algebra  @xcite .",
    "ubiquitous and profound , this algebra has become the hallmark of noncommutativity in quantum theory .",
    "the classical phase space is here the plane @xmath12 .",
    "sometimes , it is advantageous to use instead complex amplitudes represented by the annihilation and creation operators @xmath13 in terms of which the commutation relation ( [ eq : hwcom ] ) turns out to be @xmath14 = { \\hat { \\openone}}$ ] .    a pivotal role will be played in what follows by the unitary @xmath15 \\ , , \\ ] ] which is called the displacement operator for it displaces a localized state by @xmath16 .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath17 @xmath18 \\ , { \\hat { d } } ( x^\\prime , p^\\prime ) \\ ,     dx^\\prime dp^\\prime \\ , , \\",
    "] ] is an instance of a stratonovich - weyl quantizer  @xcite .",
    "one can check that the operators @xmath19 are a complete trace - orthonormal set that transforms properly under displacements @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the parity operator .",
    "let @xmath23 be an arbitrary operator acting on the hilbert space of the system . using the stratonovich - weyl quantizer we can associate to @xmath23 a function @xmath24 representing the action of the corresponding dynamical variable in phase space .",
    "in fact , this is known as the wigner - weyl map and is given by  @xcite @xmath25 \\ , .\\ ] ] the function @xmath26 is the symbol of the operator @xmath23 .",
    "conversely , we can reconstruct the operator from its symbol through @xmath27    in this context , the wigner function is nothing but the symbol of the density matrix @xmath28 , and therefore @xmath29    \\ , , &   \\nonumber \\\\     & &   \\label{eq : hwwignerdef } \\\\    & { \\hat { \\varrho } }    =    \\displaystyle     \\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{2 } } \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{2 } } { \\hat { w}}(x , p )    w_{{\\hat { \\varrho } } } ( x , p ) \\ , dx dp \\ , . &    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a pure state @xmath30 , it simplifies @xmath31 which is , perhaps , the most convenient form for actual calculations .",
    "the wigner function defined in ( [ eq : hwwignerdef ] ) fulfills all the basic properties required for any good probabilistic description .",
    "first , due to the hermiticity of @xmath32 , it is real for hermitian operators .",
    "second , the probability distributions for the canonical variables can be obtained as the marginals @xmath33 third , @xmath34 is translationally covariant , which means that for the displaced state @xmath35 @xmath36 , one has @xmath37 so that it follows displacements rigidly without changing its form , reflecting the fact that physics should not depend on a certain choice of the origin .    finally , the overlap of two density operators is proportional to the integral of the associated wigner functions : @xmath38 this property ( known as traciality ) offers practical advantages , since it allows one to predict the statistics of any outcome , once the wigner function of the measured state is known .",
    "the displacements constitute also a basic ingredient in the concept of coherent states . if we choose a fixed normalized reference state @xmath39 , we have  @xcite @xmath40 so they are parametrized by phase - space points .",
    "these states have a number of remarkable properties inherited from those of @xmath41 .",
    "in particular , @xmath17 transforms any coherent state in another coherent state : @xmath42 \\ ,    | x + x^{\\prime } , p + p^{\\prime } \\rangle \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : comcoh}\\ ] ] the standard choice for the fiducial vector @xmath43 is the vacuum @xmath44 ; which has quite a number of relevant properties .",
    "next , we analyze the superposition of two oscillators in orthogonal directions , say @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with momenta @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . the corresponding complex amplitudes @xmath49 and @xmath50 fulfill @xmath51 = \\delta_{jk } { \\hat { \\openone}}$ ] ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "since these oscillators are kinematically independent ( i.e. , they play the role of modes for the problem ) , the total system is represented by the product of the corresponding kernels @xmath53 the information is thus encoded in the four real variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the resulting wigner function @xmath56 is informationally complete , but it is hard to grasp any physical flavor from it . in particular , it can not be plotted ( which is always a major advantage when depicting complex phenomena ) and one must content oneself with sections of @xmath57 , which illustrate only partial aspects  @xcite .    because we are interested in elaborating on the behavior of oam , which mostly appears when cylindrical symmetry is present",
    ", we make the change from cartesian @xmath58 to polar @xmath59 coordinates : @xmath60 simultaneously , we change from @xmath61 to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial momentum and @xmath1 is the oam .",
    "this transition from cartesian to polar coordinates is not smooth at the origin and needs qualification because it takes from a contractible space to one which is not contractible .",
    "this lies at the root of the problems appearing when dealing with angle variables  @xcite . in quantum optics",
    "there are , however , a number of ways to bypass this drawback  @xcite . in the same vein ,",
    "the radial momentum @xmath63 is singular at the origin , which reflects a classical symptom of quantum illness  @xcite , for such an operator is not selfadjoint ( nor has selfadjoint extensions )  @xcite .",
    "precisely , the use of wigner - weyl kernels alleviate these problems arising in a direct quantization . however , we brush aside these mathematical subtleties and move on to find a suitable solution for our problem .    using the explicit form ( [ eq : hwkerneldisp ] ) for each orthogonal oscillator and after disentangling the exponentials ,",
    "we can rewrite ( [ eq : prodw1 ] ) in the equivalent way @xmath64    \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times & \\exp\\left[2i\\lambda_{r}\\sin\\varphi       ( \\hat{a}_{x}^{\\dagger } +   \\hat{a}_{x})\\right ]     \\nonumber \\\\    & \\times & \\exp\\left[-2\\sin\\varphi       ( \\alpha_{r}\\hat{a}_{y}^{\\dagger } - \\alpha_{r}^{*}\\hat{a}_{y})\\right ]    \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times & \\exp\\left[-2i\\lambda_{r}\\cos\\varphi       ( \\hat{a}_{y}^{\\dagger } +   \\hat{a}_{y})\\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the total number of excitations and we have denoted @xmath66 and @xmath67 .    the structure of this kernel suggests the use of the rotated operators @xmath68 in terms of which the oam operator reads as @xmath69 in this way , we can interpret @xmath1 as the difference of quanta with opposite chirality .",
    "note that the form of @xmath70 and @xmath71 suggests that the boson operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 furnish a jordan - schwinger representation for the problem at hand [ much in the same way as the original oscillator construction for su(2 ) ] , which can be justified on very general grounds  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such a representation should not come as a surprise , for it is well known that any three - dimensional lie algebra ( as the one we are dealing with here ) can be realized in terms of creation and annihilation operators of two orthogonal oscillators  @xcite .    by noticing that @xmath72",
    ", we can recast the wigner kernel as the displaced version @xmath73 with @xmath74   \\nonumber \\\\     & \\times & \\exp[-\\sqrt{2 } i   p_{r } ( { \\hat { x}}_{+}+{\\hat { x}}_{- } ) ] \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\exp[\\sqrt{2}i r({\\hat { p}}_{+}+{\\hat { p}}_{-})]e^{-2ip_{r}r } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we have introduced the corresponding quadratures for the rotated amplitudes @xmath75    the radial momentum @xmath63 plays no relevant role in the dynamics , so it seems entirely reasonable to integrate over this variable . to evaluate the resulting kernel we use an entangled state basis @xmath76 ( the properties of these states are briefly reviewed in appendix  [ epr ] ) , such that @xmath77 the calculations are lengthy and the details are sketched in appendix  [ wigker ] . the final result for the wigner function for a pure state",

    "@xmath90 , this reduces to @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a normalization constant .",

    "if we sum over @xmath94 , we get the state @xmath95 in fig .  1 we have plotted an isocontour surface corresponding to @xmath96 constant , for @xmath97 .",
    "we clearly appreciate quite a rich radial structure . at the top of the surface",
    ", we also include a density plot of a section by the plane @xmath98 , displaying the characteristic rings of the laguerre modes .",
    "we recall that the standard wigner function for the pair angle - oam simplifies in this case to @xmath99 which is flat in @xmath100 and the integral over the whole phase space gives the unity , reflecting the normalization of @xmath101 .",
    "we can recognize the amount of information lost in this approach when compared with @xmath102 .",
    "a similar procedure can be used for the case of the eigenstates of the angle @xmath103 .     from the maximum of the wigner function @xmath83 for the superposition state in eq .",

    "in summary , we have shown how to extend in a consistent way all the techniques developed for a continuous - variable phase space to the case of angle and angular momentum , including significant information about the radial variable .",
    "while we have not left aside the mathematical details , our main emphasis has been on presenting a simple and useful toolkit that any practitioner in the field should master . in our view , far from being an academic curiosity , the ideas expressed here have a wide range of potential applications in numerous hot topics in which oam plays a key role .",
