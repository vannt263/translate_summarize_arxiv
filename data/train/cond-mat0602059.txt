    "asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( asep ) play a critical role for understanding multiple non - equilibrium phenomena in chemistry , physics and biology @xcite .",
    "aseps have been extensively studied and applied for description of kinetics of biopolymerization @xcite , protein synthesis @xcite , transport of motor proteins in biological cells @xcite , polymer dynamics in dense medium @xcite , car traffic processes @xcite and modeling of ant trails @xcite .",
    "the majority of studied asymmetric exclusion models analyze the multi - particle dynamics along a single lane @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the more realistic description of many processes , such as car traffic and the biological transport of motor proteins @xcite , suggest that it is important to study multi - lane aseps .",
    "there have been several theoretical investigations of two - lane simple asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "we introduced earlier two - channel simple exclusion models where particles can move along the channels and between them @xcite . using a vertical cluster mean - field approach the stationary properties",
    "have been analyzed and compared with extensive computer monte carlo simulations .",
    "only the case of symmetric coupling , when the particles jump with equal rates between the lanes , has been considered .",
    "mitsudo and hayakawa @xcite extended these models to more general asymmetric rates of moving between the channels , and it was shown that kinks , or domain walls , in both channels synchronize their motion .",
    "however , the theoretical analysis has been based on the mean - field decoupling approximation that totally neglects all correlations in the system , and significant deviations from monte carlo computer simulations results have been observed , especially when the coupling is asymmetric .",
    "the effect of disorder in the transition rates and current - density relations for limited range of parameters have also been studied for two - lane exclusion processes with asymmetric coupling @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the general stationary - state properties of two - channel exclusion processes with asymmetric coupling for all possible sets of parameters .",
    "we consider the effect of asymmetry in the transition rates between the lanes by using the vertical cluster mean - field approach , that takes into account the correlations between the channels .",
    "in addition , extensive computer monte carlo simulations are performed in order to test the theoretical predictions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "theoretical description of the model and mean - field analysis are presented in section 2 .",
    "the results of monte carlo computer simulations and comparison with theoretical predictions are discussed in section 3 .",
    "summary and conclusions are presented in the final section 4 .",
    "we consider a system of two parallel one - dimensional lattices where identical particles can move along the channels and between them , as shown in fig .",
    "each lattice has @xmath0 sites , and every site can be occupied by no more than one particle or it can be empty . at every time",
    "step a site is randomly chosen from the lane 1 or 2 . in the bulk of the system",
    "the particle dynamics is described by the following rules .",
    "a particle can change the lane with the rate @xmath1 or @xmath2 from the channel 1 or 2 , correspondingly , if the vertical neighboring site is available - see fig .",
    "1 . the particle at site @xmath3 can also move from left to right along the same channel to site @xmath4 , if this site is empty .",
    "the rates for horizontal moves from the site @xmath5 depend on the occupancy state of the site @xmath5 on another lane . the particle on lane 1 moves to the right with the rate @xmath6 if the vertical neighboring site is not occupied , otherwise it jumps with the rate 1 .",
    "similarly , for the particle on lane 2 the horizontal transition rates are equal to @xmath7 ( the vertical neighbor is empty ) or 1 .",
    "these rules satisfy the condition that the total probability per unit time of leaving the site @xmath5 ( in any direction ) is always equal to 1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are special entrance and exit dynamic rules at the boundaries .",
    "particles can enter the system with the rate @xmath8 if any of the first sites at each lane is not occupied .",
    "when a particle reaches the exit site @xmath0 it can leave the system with the rate @xmath9 if the exit site on another lane is occupied . otherwise , the exit rates are @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the channel 1 and 2 , correspondingly",
    ".     and @xmath2 . the horizontal transition rates are @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the channel 1 and 2 , correspondingly , if the vertical neighboring sites are empty .",
    "otherwise , particle move with the rate 1 .",
    "entrance rates are equal to @xmath8 at both lanes .",
    "exit rates are equal to @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the lane 1 and 2 , respectively , if the exit vertical cluster is half - occupied . for the fully - occupied vertical cluster at the exit",
    "the rate of leaving is @xmath9 . ]    for simplicity , in the present work we consider only the case of full asymmetry in the vertical transition rates with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , our analysis can also be straightforwardly applied for more general asymmetric couplings in two - channel aseps .",
    "note also that there is a particle - hole symmetry in the system , and it can be mapped into itself by exchanging everywhere the labels 1 and 2 and the rates @xmath8 and @xmath9 . this symmetry is important for understanding the stationary - state properties of two - lanes exclusion processes",
    ".      theoretical study of two - channel asep with symmetric coupling @xcite indicates that correlations between the channels strongly influence the stationary - state properties of the system , however the horizontal correlations inside the lanes are relatively weak .",
    "the effect of inter - channel correlations is even larger for two - channel aseps with asymmetric coupling @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a cluster mean - field approach @xcite , that explicitly takes into account the correlations inside the vertical cluster of lattice sites , is the most appropriate and convenient theoretical tool for analyzing these systems .",
    "the basic quantities of the vertical cluster mean - field approach are the probabilities to find any vertical cluster in one of four possible states , as shown in fig .",
    "considering the lattice sites far away from the boundaries of the system , it is assumed that the occupation of vertical clusters is independent of the position along the channels .",
    "we define @xmath14 as a probability to find a vertical cluster with both lattice sites filled , @xmath15 and @xmath16 as probabilities to have a half - empty vertical cluster with a particle at the channel 1 or 2 , respectively , and @xmath17 as a probability to have no particles at both lattice sites .",
    "the conservation of probability requires that @xmath18 in addition , the bulk densities at each channel can be expressed in terms of the vertical cluster probabilities , @xmath19    , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding probabilities for each state . ]",
    "the dynamics of the system can be described via master equations for evolution of every vertical cluster state .",
    "specifically , for the fully occupied cluster we have @xmath20 in the limit of @xmath21 the system reaches a stationary state with @xmath22 , and this equation simplifies into @xmath23 similarly , for the half - filled vertical clusters it can be shown that @xmath24 that at the stationary - state limit ( @xmath25 ) reduces to @xmath26 from eqs .",
    "( [ prob_norm ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) it is possible to calculate the stationary - state probabilities of the different vertical cluster states , and consequently all properties of two - channel aseps with asymmetric coupling can be obtained .    in the bulk of the system",
    "the stationary currents are given by the following expressions , @xmath27 the particle currents at the boundaries are different form the bulk expressions .",
    "for entrance we obtain @xmath28 while at the exit it can be shown that @xmath29 although the currents on the individual lanes can differ from each other , the overall current of the system at the stationary state is always constant , @xmath30    solving together eqs .",
    "( [ prob_norm ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) leads to a conclusion that at large times there are three possible cases . in one region of phase space for all bulk lattice sites we have @xmath31 which means that the bulk density at the lane 1 is zero .",
    "in another region of the parameter s space @xmath32 that leads to @xmath33 , i.e. , the channel 2 is fully occupied by the particles .",
    "there is also a case when the two - channel system can be divided in two parts , with eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) valid in one part while eq .",
    "( [ case2 ] ) is satisfied in another part .",
    "let us consider first the region in the parameter s space when the system is described by eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) . in this case",
    "there are only two possible states for the vertical clusters , the cluster with both empty sites ( 00 ) and the cluster with the occupied site on lane 2 ( 01 ) .",
    "the expressions for the particle currents are significantly simplified , @xmath34 then the dynamics of the two - lane system can be viewed as an effective one - channel transport with `` particles '' given by ( 01 ) vertical clusters and `` holes '' being ( 00 ) vertical clusters .",
    "the particles are entering into the system with an effective rate @xmath35 , that can be calculated from eqs .",
    "( [ currents1 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are two entrance currents . at the same time",
    "the effective particles are exiting with the rate @xmath9 since there is only one exit current .",
    "it is known @xcite that the corresponding one - channel asep has low - density , high - density and maximal - current phases , and we conclude that there are also three phases , labeled as ( 0,ld ) , ( 0,hd ) and ( 0,mc ) , in this part of the phase space for the two - channel asep with asymmetric coupling .",
    "the indexes in these labels for the different phases reflect the fact that @xmath36 is always in the bulk of the system , while the state of the channel 2 depends on the entrance and exit rates .",
    "the phase boundaries and the effective entrance rate @xmath37 can be determined in the following way . in the low - density phase ( 0,ld )",
    "the entrance current determines the total current in the system , namely , @xmath38 from eqs .",
    "( [ currents1 ] ) we have @xmath39 with @xmath40 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath41 this phase exists for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , that leads to the following conditions , @xmath44 with the total current in this phase given by @xmath45.\\ ] ] in the phase ( 0,hd ) the exit processes determine the particle dynamics in the channel 2 , and this phase exists for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "it can be easily calculated that in this phase @xmath48 the conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 specify the phase ( 0,md ) with the maximal current at the channel 2 .",
    "the stationary - state properties of this phase are given by @xmath51 it is also important to note that because the total particle current through the system can not be larger than 1/4 all three phases that satisfy the eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) can not exist for @xmath52 .",
    "similar calculations can be performed for the region of the phase space where eq .",
    "( [ case2 ] ) is valid . since in this case",
    "only the fully filled ( 11 ) and half - filed ( 01 ) vertical clusters can exist in the bulk , that leads to @xmath33 and the system again can be mapped into effective one - channel asep",
    ". then there are three possible phases , called ( ld,1 ) , ( hd,1 ) and ( mc,1 ) , can be found for this range of parameters .",
    "the particle currents are given by @xmath53 the ( 11 ) vertical cluster play a role of new effective particles that enter the system with the rate @xmath8 and exit with an effective rate @xmath54 . from eqs .",
    "( [ currents2 ] ) it can be shown that @xmath55 the phase ( ld,1 ) exists for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "for this phase we obtain @xmath58 the conditions for the ( hd,1 ) phase are given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , that leads to @xmath61 in this phase the stationary - state current is equal to @xmath62,\\ ] ] while the densities are @xmath63 the third possible phase is ( mc,1 ) , defined for @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this phase the steady - state properties are given by @xmath66 using the same arguments as above , all three phases described by eq .",
    "( [ case2 ] ) can not be found for @xmath50 .",
    "note that these results can also be obtained by utilizing the particle - hole symmetry of the two - channel aseps with asymmetric coupling .",
    "the symmetry arguments also suggest that @xmath67 is a phase boundary between ( 0,hd ) and ( ld,1 ) phases .",
    "finally , for @xmath52 and @xmath68 we have a situation when in one part of the two - channel system eq .",
    "( [ case1 ] ) is valid , while in the other part eq . ( [ case2 ] ) determines the stationary behavior .",
    "we call this phase ( mc , mc ) , and the total current in the system is equal to 1/4 . because of the particle - hole symmetry the boundary between two different parts",
    "is expected to be found exactly at the middle of the lanes .",
    "thus , the vector cluster mean - field analysis suggests that there are seven stationary phases in two - channel exclusion processes with asymmetric coupling . the predicted phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "3 . there are two types of phase transitions can be observed in the system .",
    "the first - order phase transitions ( shown by solid lines in fig .",
    "3 ) involve a jump in the particle densities , while in the continuum phase transitions ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "3 ) there are smooth changes in the density profiles .     and @xmath13 ) .",
    "lines correspond to theoretical predictions , symbols are from the computer monte carlo simulations .",
    "solid lines describe the first - order phase transitions , while dashed lines represent the continuum phase transitions . ]",
    "although our calculations are performed only for the case of full asymmetry in inter - channel coupling , similar calculations can be made for systems with general asymmetry ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is expected to also find seven stationary phases in the phase diagram , although the phase boundaries , currents and the density profiles will depend explicitly on the vertical transition rates .",
    "our theoretical approach based on the vertical cluster mean - field description of two - channel asep with asymmetric coupling predicts a complex phase diagram with many non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "it also allows to calculate stationary currents and density profiles in both channels . in order to test our theoretical results , a series of extensive monte carlo computer simulations",
    "have been carried out .",
    "since the predictions of the mean - field treatment are valid only in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. , @xmath70 , our simulations has been performed for different lattice sizes with @xmath71 , 500 , 1000 and 5000 .",
    "most of our computer simulations results are obtained for @xmath72 for which it was found that finite - size effects can be neglected . for faster computations",
    "the so - called bkl algorithm @xcite has been used .",
    "this method skips uneventful monte - carlo steps and it makes a corresponding correction in the calculation of the effective monte carlo time . employing the bkl algorithm has been especially useful for the cases of phase coexistence and for slow dynamics for weak entrance and exit rates .",
    "the density profiles and currents in our simulations have been computed by averaging @xmath73 monte carlo steps per site , although at the phase boundaries to obtain more accurate description we used @xmath74 steps per site . in order to be confident that the system reached the steady state , typically first 3 - 5 @xmath75 of all monte carlo steps",
    "have been neglected .    the phase diagram computed from monte carlo simulations",
    "is presented in fig . 3 , and it can be seen that our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with computer simulations results .",
    "more information can be extracted from the density profiles that are shown in fig .",
    "4 . theoretically calculated",
    "density profiles in both channels also agree quite well with the results from computer simulations , although there are deviations near the boundaries of the channels .",
    "this is due to the fact that in our approximate theoretical treatment it was assumed that probabilities of vertical clusters are independent of the position along the lattice .",
    "obviously , this assumption is valid only in the bulk of the system far away from the boundaries .",
