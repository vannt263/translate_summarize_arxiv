    "the random multiplicative process ( rmp ) is a well - known mechanism leading to power - law behavior .",
    "it is a stochastic process where the stochastic variable is driven by a multiplicative noise .",
    "it has been extensively used as a model for a variety of systems such as on - off intermittency  @xcite , lasers  @xcite , economic activity  @xcite , variation of biological populations in fluctuating environment  @xcite , and passive scalar field advected by fluid  @xcite .    in real systems , the stochastic variable",
    "may often be driven not only by the multiplicative noise , but also by some weak additive noise .",
    "this weak additive noise becomes important when the amplitude of the stochastic variable @xmath0 takes small values , and introduces an effective lower bound of @xmath0 .",
    "actually , this lower bound may be crucial , because it guarantees the existence of a stationary probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "furthermore , the pdf here has a power - law form over a wide range of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "for example , venkataramani _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced a langevin equation with multiplicative and additive noise terms as a model for noisy on - off intermittency .",
    "they obtained a stationary pdf with a power - law tail .",
    "the same form of langevin equation was treated by takayasu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as a model for economic activity , and they also showed that the pdf obeys a power law .",
    "a similar model was introduced by levy _",

    "@xcite : it describes a discrete stochastic process driven by a multiplicative noise .",

    "_ treated the additive noise explicitly , while the lower bound introduced by levy _",
    "et al . _ plays a role similar to the additive noise . in this paper , we are concerned with this type of stochastic processes .",
    "recently , another type of asymptotic power law was found in the above type of stochastic processes . in previous papers",
    "@xcite , we introduced a stochastic process in order to explain the power law displayed by the spatial correlation function @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 for small enough @xmath3 , observed in the spatio - temporal chaotic regime of systems with non - locally coupled elements .",
    "our explanation was based on a rmp with weak additive noise such as described above .",
    "note , however , that the power - law correlation here is not a direct result of the power - law tail of the pdf itself , but it is a result of the asymptotic power law of moments @xmath4 of the stochastic variable @xmath0 as a function of the strength @xmath5 of the additive noise , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "this gives another mechanism leading to power - law behavior in such stochastic processes .",
    "the goal of this paper is to clarify this mechanism for the emergence of the power law of moments with respect to the strength of the additive noise .",

    "the crucial role of the additive noise in generating a power - law pdf is to save the stochastic variable from decaying completely by generating small fluctuations around the zero value where a normal diffusion process dominates .",

    "we use three different types of noise for @xmath9 : ( i ) gauss - markov noise produced by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process , ( ii ) dichotomous noise which takes values @xmath83 or @xmath171 with equal transition probabilities , and ( iii ) chaotic noise produced by the lorenz model .",
    "we normalize the average and variance of each noise to @xmath13 and @xmath83 respectively , and use it for @xmath9 .",

    "we also studied the case where the saturation of @xmath0 is not due to the reflective walls but a nonlinearity @xmath165 , and found that a power law with the same exponent still holds .",
    "we also confirmed that the pdf has a power - law tail for each type of noise .",
    "since the noise is colored , it would be difficult to predict the values of the exponents of the moments from the previous theory . in order to achieve this , some sort of renormalization procedure , like the one done in @xcite ,",
    "must be invoked to give effective @xmath14 and @xmath172 .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "since noisy on - off intermittency is a typical phenomenon with the mechanism of generating the power law of moments , we briefly discuss it here .    on - off intermittency is observed where a chaotic attractor becomes marginally stable with respect to disturbances transversal to the invariant manifold in which the chaotic attractor is embedded .",
    "this type of instability is called a blowout bifurcation .",
    "the system then alternates between two phases intermittently : a laminar phase where the system stays practically on the invariant manifold , and a burst phase where the deviation from the invariant manifold grows suddenly .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the on - off intermittency is that the distance between the orbit and the invariant manifold is governed by a multiplicative process with a chaotically changing multiplier .",

    ", we numerically calculate a pair of rssler oscillators coupled with each other , and with weak additive noise applied only to the first component of the state variables : @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath185 are gaussian - white noise of average @xmath13 and variance @xmath83 , and @xmath5 controls their strength .",
    "we set the coupling strength @xmath175 to the value slightly above @xmath176 , where the system shows noisy on - off intermittency .",
    "figure [ fig:9 ] shows second moments of the difference between the first components @xmath186 versus the noise strength @xmath5 , obtained for some values of the coupling strength @xmath175 .",
    "as expected , they show power - law dependence on @xmath5 , and their exponents vary with @xmath175 .",
    "we also observed the power law of moments in a system of coupled chaotic elements with a slight parameter mismatch  @xcite in place of a weak additive noise , where the parameter mismatch plays a role similar to the additive noise .",
    "the power law of moments is also observed in systems of coupled maps  @xcite .      the power - law spatial correlation which we studied in the previous papers  @xcite turns out to be the same as the power law described above , with a proper physical interpretation of some variables involved .",
    "the systems we treated previously are the populations of spatially distributed chaotic elements .",
    "the elements are driven by a field produced by non - local coupling , which is spatially long - waved and temporally irregular .",
    "if we consider the difference @xmath187 between the amplitude @xmath188 of two elements which are separated by a short distance @xmath3 , its moments @xmath189 are directly related to the spatial correlations of @xmath188 .",
    "they are similar to the structure functions in the context of fluid turbulence or the height - height correlations in the context of fractal surface growth .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath190 is given by a rmp with a weak additive noise , where the multiplier is the local lyapunov exponent fluctuating randomly due to the chaotic motion of the elements , and the weak additive noise comes from the small difference in the strength of the applied field between the two points under consideration .",
    "since the strength @xmath5 of the additive noise should be of the order of @xmath3 due to the assumed smooth spatial variation of the applied field , the power law of moments as a function of @xmath5 is now interpreted as a power law of moments of the amplitude difference @xmath0 as a function of the mutual distance @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath191 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath192 are constants .",
    "when the average lyapunov exponent is negative , @xmath88 vanishes and the exponent @xmath91 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : exp_neg ] ) .",
    "it shows a `` bifractality '' similar to that known for burgers equation , which implies an underlying intermittent structure .",
    "as in the models for noisy on - off intermittency and economic activity , a stochastic process driven by multiplicative and weak additive noise shows a power - law pdf .",
    "the pdf consists of a constant part and a power - law part , and their boundary moves with the strength @xmath5 of the additive noise in such a way that its distance from the origin is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "this systematic dependence on @xmath5 causes the power law of the moments with respect to the strength of the additive noise .    in order to study this phenomenon in further detail",
    ", we introduced a langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) with multiplicative and additive noise terms as a general model for a stochastic process of this type .",
    "we analyzed its stationary state theoretically and numerically , and found that this model actually reproduces the power law of moments .",
    "furthermore , by comparing the approximate and exact treatments of the effect of the additive noise , the usual approximation of the additive noise by introducing a lower bound of the amplitude was justified .",
    "although we restricted our study to the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) for the sake of precise argument , the power law itself is not sensitive to the details of the model employed , and can appear robustly in many stochastic processes driven by multiplicative and weak additive noise .",
    "we demonstrated such robustness numerically for some different models , where the system is driven by noises which are not gaussian - white .",
    "furthermore , as some typical realizations of this type of power law , we discussed the power law of moments in noisy on - off intermittency , and the power - law spatial correlation functions in the spatio - temporal chaotic regime of non - locally coupled systems , which gives some more insight into the power law of the spatial correlation function .    as we already noted , the power law of moments seems to be a general phenomenon appearing in various systems over a wide range of parameters .",
    "this mechanism of generating a power law seems to be quite universal , and some of the power laws observed in the real world may belong to this class ."
