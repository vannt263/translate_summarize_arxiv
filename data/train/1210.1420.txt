    "realizing an on demand source of entangled photon pairs is crucial for many innovative applications in quantum information science @xcite and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "related applications comprise quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , or quantum key distribution @xcite as well as tests of fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "a very promising scheme to generate polarization entangled photon pairs is to use the radiative decay of the biexciton state ( consisting of two electron - hole pairs ) in a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) @xcite .",
    "problems related to the fine structure splitting of the intermediate exciton states have largely been overcome @xcite and recently , impressive experiments reported the realization of ultrabright sources by coupling a photonic molecule to a single qd @xcite .",
    "a necessary precondition for an efficient use of the biexciton decay cascade is a robust preparation of the biexciton state . in principle , an inversion of the qd from the ground to the biexciton state is possible by driving the system with a transform limited laser pulse of constant frequency , that is resonant to half of the ground state biexciton transition frequency @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this rabi - flopping scheme is that it requires a very detailed knowledge of the system parameters like the transition dipole moments as well as a very precise control of the field intensity in order to ensure the desired inversion .",
    "recalling that these requirements are often only insufficiently fulfilled , it seems that a more practical way to realize a stable and high - quality preparation of the biexciton state is the use of optical driving schemes that rely on adiabatic rapid passage ( arp ) and use frequency - swept ( chirped ) pulses .",
    "the basic idea underlying such schemes , that are stable with respect to intensity changes of the laser field , is to drive the system adiabatically along an eigenstate of the coupled light - matter hamiltonian , whereby the character of the state changes during the pulse via a level anticrossing .",
    "recently , experimental studies by wu et al.@xcite and simon et al.@xcite that aimed to prepare the single exciton state by means of arp , have proven the applicability of an earlier proposed theoretical protocol @xcite and demonstrated a stable generation of the exciton state , that in the arp - regime did only slightly depend on the applied pulse area . however , the efficiency reported in these experiments stayed below the ideal case and most recent theoretical calculations gave compelling evidence that this reduction can be attributed to the coupling of the qd to acoustic phonons @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that acoustic phonons lead to a drastic deterioration of the exciton generation for negative values of the chirp , while an efficient preparation can be achieved for positive chirps , where the phonon influence is restricted to phonon absorption processes that become unlikely at low temperatures.@xcite the reported drastic changes compared to the ideal scheme in the absence of the carrier - phonon interaction @xcite emphasize the necessity to study the influence of the unavoidable coupling of carriers to acoustic phonons on other schemes relying on arp in order to fully characterize their true potential .    in this paper , we discuss two different arp based protocols aiming at an inversion of the qd to the biexciton state and give a comprehensive analysis of the phonon impact on these schemes . in the first protocol , the qd is driven by a single linearly polarized chirped pulse where the frequency at the pulse maximum is resonant to half of the ground state biexciton transition as first suggested by hui and liu @xcite . in the second scheme , the qd",
    "is driven by two circularly polarized chirped pulses , that at the pulse maxima are resonant to the ground state exciton and to the exciton biexciton transition , respectively . for both protocols , the evolution of the system along an adiabatic branch is more complex than for two - level schemes .",
    "for example , in contrast to the two - level case , arp is here sensitive to the sign of the chirp even without taking the carrier - phonon interaction into account .",
    "therefore , it is a priori unclear to what extent the efficiency is affected by the coupling to acoustic phonons .",
    "it turns out , however , that similar to the results reported in ref .   for the inversion to the exciton state , an efficient preparation of the biexciton",
    "is restricted to positive chirps and low temperatures .",
    "quite significant differences between both investigated protocols arise for moderate and large values of the biexciton binding energy @xmath1 , as the pulse area threshold that has to be exceeded in order to ensure a purely adiabatic evolution rises strongly with @xmath1 for the first scheme , whereas it is independent of @xmath1 for the second protocol .",

    "let us first concentrate on a two - photon resonance arp - scheme that uses one linearly polarized pulse .",

    "the biexciton occupation depends sensitively on the pulse intensity and performs rabi rotations between the ground and the biexciton state with a rabi period that strongly depends on the biexciton binding energy @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for large enough positive chirps , an ideal and robust biexciton preparation , which is insensitive to small variations of the pulse area , can be achieved provided that the applied pulse area exceeds the arp - threshold .",
    "the latter rises significantly with increasing @xmath1 and shows for finite @xmath1 also a considerable dependence on the strength of the chirp .",
    "interestingly , the situation is different for negative chirps : for @xmath55 , a stable biexciton preparation can be only achieved for almost vanishing or large enough biexciton binding energies [ cf .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and ( c ) ] , but fails for moderate values of @xmath1 , as it can be exemplarily seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for @xmath56  mev , where for @xmath55 a stripe - like pattern forms .",
    "this dependence of the dynamics on the sign of the chirp contrasts to the widely studied arp - protocols for the generation of the exciton state @xcite and has to be taken into account also in situations where one expects the influence of phonons to be negligible .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] as well as the phonon impact that will be studied below can be most easily understood by analyzing the system evolution in the dressed state picture , i.e. , by considering the instantaneous eigenstates and eigenenergies that are obtained by diagonalizing the combined light - matter hamiltonian @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as a function of time for @xmath57 and different values of the original pulse area @xmath24 as well as of the biexciton binding energy @xmath1 together with the corresponding pulse envelope functions ( shaded areas ) . long before and long after the pulse maximum , it is possible to identify the instantaneous eigenstates with the electronic ground state @xmath5 , the single exciton state @xmath58 , and the biexciton state @xmath7 , as it is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . during the pulse , the character of the eigenstates changes .",
    "for example , the lowest branch , that can initially be identified with @xmath5 , eventually transforms into @xmath7 .",
    "it is precisely this transformation that allows a stable biexciton preparation within the two - photon resonance arp - scheme for positive values of @xmath27 when the condition for adiabatic passage is fulfilled , i.e. , when the change in the frequency and the change in the amplitude of the pulse are slow compared to the rabi frequency @xcite . in this case",
    "the system evolves along a single branch and passes all anticrossings .",
    "obviously , both conditions are better fulfilled for higher pulse areas ( corresponding to higher rabi frequencies ) , which can be nicely seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by comparing the left and the right column , that show the branches for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively : the splitting of the anticrossings considerably increases with rising @xmath24 . by comparing the different rows of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it can also be seen that for a given pulse area , the anticrossings become narrower for larger biexciton binding energies , explaining the rising threshold for arp with increasing @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . while for @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ cf .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] the splitting of the central anticrossing at @xmath63 is large enough to ensure an adiabatic passage resulting in the preparation of the biexciton state [ cf .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ] , the situation is different for larger @xmath1 . when the anticrossing becomes too narrow [ cf .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( e ) ] , the chirp rate is no longer small compared to the spacing between the branches , the condition for arp is violated and the system does not evolve along a single branch .    considering negative chirps , the situation is slightly more complex .",
    "for @xmath64 the system evolution along the instantaneous eigenstates can easily be derived from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] by reading the plots from the right to the left ( i.e. , by replacing the time @xmath65 by @xmath66 ) . obviously , a transformation from @xmath5 into @xmath7 is here possible by following the uppermost branch . in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath67 , one passes two anticrossings along the upper branch and the system evolves completely adiabatically . for @xmath68 ,",
    "both anticrossings are very narrow and the system jumps two times from one branch to another branch instead of following the anticrossings . both crossings together result again in the preparation of the biexciton , as it can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) . for @xmath69 ,",
    "the anticrossings are narrow , but still considerably wider than for larger biexciton binding energies . in consequence ,",
    "the system does not evolve completely adiabatically ( via pure anticrossings ) nor purely non - adiabatically ( via pure crossings ) and a rabi - like behavior is realized instead of a stable and robust preparation of the biexciton giving rise to the stripe - like pattern as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) for @xmath70 .",
    "the details of this pattern can be explained as follows : the fringes which develop from the occupation maxima or minima of the usual rabi rotations that are realized at @xmath71 decline for rising chirps because of two reasons : first , with increasing chirp the effective pulse area exceeds more and more the original pulse area [ as it can be seen by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f0 ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) ] and second , the rabi period decreases with increasing detuning @xcite .",
    "this leads to an increased number of occupation maxima or minima compared to @xmath71 .",
    "the attenuation of the stripe pattern in the range of high pulse areas and large chirps is due to an increasing splitting between the adiabatic branches that leads to a more and more adiabatic evolution .",
    "next , we shall include the carrier - phonon interaction . shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) is the final biexciton occupation after the pulse as a function of the original pulse area a and the chirp coefficient @xmath27 at a temperature of @xmath72  k for the same biexciton binding energies as considered in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . compared to the ideal evolution in the absence of acoustic phonons",
    "there are similarities as well as obvious differences . as in the phonon - free case the arp - threshold in the pulse - area rises with increasing biexciton binding energies and for @xmath73 mev and negative chirps ,",
    "the stripe - like pattern discussed above is still visible .",
    "however , it is clearly seen that within the full model , the efficiency of the protocol does now strongly depend on the sign of the chirp , regardless of the size of the biexciton binding energy . while for positive chirps a rather stable biexciton generation is reached",
    ", negative chirps result in general in very low occupations of the biexciton state , in particular at high pulse areas .",
    "to understand this difference , one should recall that for a positive chirp , the adiabatic evolution follows the lowest adiabatic branch ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "phonon mediated transitions to one of the other two branches , that spoil the purely adiabatic evolution and hamper the preparation of the biexciton state , are for @xmath74 thus only possible via phonon absorption processes . at @xmath0",
    "k the latter are rather weak and hence , there is a perceivable but small deterioration of the protocol efficiency compared to the phonon - free case . for negative chirps , in contrast",
    ", the adiabatic evolution of the system follows the uppermost branch and transitions to one of the lower branches are possible by phonon emission processes , which at low temperatures dominate . in consequence ,",
    "the population of the upper branch is drastically reduced in the course of time and an efficient preparation of the biexciton via arp is no longer possible .",
    "the temperature - dependence of the efficiency of the two - photon arp scheme is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) , where the final biexciton occupation is shown as a function of @xmath24 for a chirped pulse with @xmath75 , a biexciton binding energy of @xmath76  mev and three different temperatures of @xmath77 , @xmath0 and @xmath78  k. while for @xmath0  k and pulse areas above the arp - threshold occupations of about @xmath79 are reached , the situation drastically deteriorates at elevated temperatures , where phonon absorption processes gain in importance due to a higher number of thermal phonons . already at @xmath78  k , the biexciton generation turns out to be very inefficient with typical biexciton occupations staying below @xmath80 . on the contrary",
    ", it is interesting to note that for temperatures well below @xmath0  k , an almost ideal biexciton preparation can be realized as exemplarily shown for @xmath81  k , where in the adiabatic regime a high - fidelity preparation of the biexciton with occupations higher than @xmath82 is achieved .",
    "this remarkably strong difference between @xmath83 and @xmath0  k contrasts to wide - spread expectations that for low temperatures the impact of phonons is not very sensitive to a variation of few kelvins and emphasizes the importance of realizing low temperatures",
    ".    a closer look on the curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) reveals further , that for pulse intensities above the threshold , the biexciton occupation depends nonmonotonically on the pulse area : an initial decrease is followed by a slight increase .",
    "this nonmonotonic behavior in the arp regime corresponds to the reappearance of rabi rotations in the usual rabi regime @xcite and can be traced back to the resonance character of the carrier - phonon coupling @xcite .",
    "the slow increase of the signal at high pulse areas as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) is mainly due to the gaussian pulse envelope , which in the rabi regime is known to lead to a rather weak reappearance because of an incomplete dynamical decoupling between lattice vibrations and electronic dynamics .",
    "@xcite          let us next turn to an alternative arp - scheme .",
    "the qd is now driven by two simultaneously applied frequency swept pulses of equal chirp , where the first pulse is circularly @xmath3 polarized and at the pulse maximum resonant to the ground state exciton transition , i.e. , @xmath84 , while the second pulse is circularly @xmath4 polarized and at its maximum in resonance to the exciton biexciton transition , i.e. , @xmath85 .",
    "a schematic sketch of this two - color protocol is drawn as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) . neglecting the exciton - phonon coupling ,",
    "also the two - color scheme allows for an ideal and stable preparation of the biexciton . as an example , fig .  [ fig4](a ) shows the final biexciton occupation as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath27 for @xmath86  mev , where @xmath24 now denotes the original pulse area of each circularly polarized pulse .",
    "we checked that even considerable deviations between both pulses with regard to the pulse intensity or the frequency sweep do not reduce the efficiency of the scheme provided that both components fulfill the condition for arp . also a finite delay between both pulses",
    "has no significant effect on the efficiency as long as the pulse that drives the ground state exciton transition precedes the pulse driving the exciton biexciton transition .",
    "thus , the protocol is robust with respect to these changes and therefore , it is justified to concentrate on the case of equal pulse parameters and zero delay for reasons of simplicity .",
    "an analysis of the adiabatic spectral branches for the two - color protocol shares many similarities with that given in sec .",
    "[ results : gbt ] for the two - photon resonance scheme and shall therefore not be presented at length .",
    "for positive chirps , the ground state transforms into the biexciton state via the lowest branch , whereas for negative chirps , the same transformation can be achieved by following the uppermost branch [ cf .",
    "[ fig4](c ) ] .",
    "therefore , in the presence of the carrier - phonon coupling , a stable preparation is again only possible for positive chirps , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) for @xmath87  k. a further similarity to the first protocol is that the two - color scheme is even in the phonon - free case sensitive to the sign of the chirp and that for negative chirps and small biexciton binding energies , a rabi - like behavior is realized due to a neither purely adiabatic nor purely non - adiabatic evolution .",
    "the resulting pattern seen in the occupation when recorded as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath27 ( not shown ) resembles that discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . here , these patterns are most pronounced for @xmath88  mev , which is half of the value of @xmath89  mev , where the rabi - like behavior is strongest in the two - photon resonance scheme . for these values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the detuning of the respective off - resonant levels is identical for both protocols .     for @xmath90 and @xmath75 at different temperatures .",
    "crosses and squares represent results for @xmath91 , @xmath75 and @xmath92  k for the two - color pulse arp - protocol and the two - photon resonance arp - protocol , respectively .",
    ", width=321 ]    despite these similarities , one can also note significant and interesting differences between both considered protocols . unlike for the two - photon resonance scheme , for the two - color protocol the pulse area threshold that must be exceeded in order to ensure an adiabatic dynamics is independent of the biexciton binding energy , as the transition to the biexciton does never involve excitation paths via strongly detuned intermediate levels .",
    "independent of the chirp , the threshold is roughly given by @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , the two - color protocol is particularly advantageous for qds with large biexciton binding energies .",
    "for example , for a high but still realistic value of @xmath93  mev and a chirp of @xmath94 , the two - photon resonance scheme would require pulse areas above @xmath95 to reach the adiabatic limit and thus sixteen times as intense pulses as within the two - color protocol .",
    "this is exemplarily shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath92  k.    besides the threshold characteristics , the detailed temperature and pulse area dependencies in the respective arp - regime differ .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the biexciton occupation is plotted for both protocols as a function of the pulse area for a chirp of @xmath94 and at temperatures of @xmath83 , @xmath0 , and @xmath78  k. solid lines represent the results within the two - color scheme and dashed lines the results of the two - photon resonance protocol that have already been discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) . while for @xmath92  k",
    "the two - color scheme is for pulse areas around @xmath96 much more efficient than the two - photon resonance protocol , the situation is reversed at high pulse areas , where the efficiency is worse for the two - color scheme . for low temperatures ,",
    "the two - color protocol performs slightly better , in particular at high pulse areas , where for @xmath77  k an almost perfect inversion to the biexciton state is achieved .",
    "common to the two - photon resonance scheme is the pronounced difference in the protocol efficiency between @xmath77 and @xmath0  k as well as the nonmonotonic pulse area dependence .",
    "however , for the two - color scheme , the latter is slightly stronger and shows minima at smaller pulse areas .",
    "this finding is in line with recent calculations for transform limited pulses , that have revealed that the reappearance of rabi rotations sets in at smaller pulse areas , when the polarization of the excitation is changed from linear to circular.@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the impact of acoustic phonons on two protocols aiming at a robust preparation of the biexciton state in a semiconductor qd . in the absence of the carrier - phonon interaction either driving the system with a single linearly polarized chirped pulse tuned at its maximum to the two - photon resonance of the ground state biexciton transition or using a two - color scheme where two circularly polarized chirped pulses are at their maxima in resonance with the ground state exciton and the exciton biexciton transition , respectively , enables a perfect preparation of the biexciton state provided that the conditions for adiabatic rapid passage are fulfilled .",
    "the most remarkable difference between both schemes , which is seen already without phonons , is the finding that the threshold for arp rises drastically for the first protocol with rising biexciton binding energies , while in the second protocol there is essentially no such dependence on the threshold .",
    "different from related investigations of the preparation of the exciton state we here find a strong asymmetry with respect to the sign of the frequency sweep already in the idealized phonon - free case .",
    "in particular , we observe for finite negative chirps and intermediate biexciton binding energies a rabi - like behavior , indicating a regime where the system neither evolves fully adiabatically along the adiabatic spectral branches nor does it switch between different branches without interference as it would be the case in the extreme non - adiabatic limit .",
    "accounting for phonons in general reduces the fidelity of both protocols and introduces an additional asymmetry with respect to the sign of the chirp that , as also known from earlier studies of the exciton preparation , results from the fact that for positive chirp the phonon emission is suppressed .",
    "a robust biexciton preparation is thus restricted to positive chirps and low temperatures .",
    "it is interesting to note that already at 4 k the efficiency is reduced to about 90 % while at 1 k an almost perfect biexciton preparation is possible in spite of the phonons .    taking the efficiency of the biexciton preparation as the only criterion it turns out that the two - color scheme performs slightly better for low temperatures .",
    "moreover , for all temperatures the threshold is lower .",
    "nevertheless , evaluating both schemes for practical usability these advantages should be weighted against some obvious drawbacks : the need of two pulses with different colors and ( when thinking of using the biexciton decay cascade ) the problem of laser stray light at the detection wavelength .",
    "the latter problem can be overcome by using up - conversion techniques @xcite or non - resonant emitter - cavity coupling @xcite .",
    "thus , by paying the price of an increased effort one can indeed benefit from the better performance of the two color scheme .",
    "we expect that our analysis shall be a helpful guidance for making an adequate decision between performance and effort in upcoming experiments .",
