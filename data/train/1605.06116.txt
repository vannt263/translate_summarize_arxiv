    "the presence of hydrogen in the spectrum primarily splits sne into type i ( hydrogen - poor ) and type ii ( hydrogen - rich ) . focusing on type ii sne",
    ", the amount of hydrogen that the progenitor stars retained at the time of the explosion strongly affects the evolution of the sn and in particular the shape of the light curve ( lc ) .",
    "it can show a plateau ( type ii - p sne ) or a linear decline after peak ( type ii - l sne ) .",
    "type ii - p sne are supposed to arise from progenitor stars in the mass range of @xmath7 m@xmath6 @xcite that reach the evolution state at which the collapse of the iron core occurs .",
    "it has also been suggested that the progenitors of type ii - l sne could have larger masses at zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) than type ii - p @xcite .",
    "in particular , type ii - l sne are thought to originate from progenitor stars with less hydrogen ( @xmath8 m@xmath6 ) and larger radii ( few 1000 r@xmath6 ) with respect to those that give birth to type ii - p sne @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed a physical continuity from type",
    "ii - l to type iib sne , which show even less amount of hydrogen in the spectra at early phases , and then to type i - b sne , where there is no sign of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "whether type ii - p and ii - l sne are two clearly separated subclasses , and thus originated from two different types of progenitors , or a continuum exists between the two is still debated @xcite .",
    "the lack of significant spectroscopic differences between the two classes leaves just the lc shape as the discriminating factor ( or more quantitatively , the luminosity decline rate ) . in the literature , there are several parameters proposed for a quantitative discrimination between the type ii - p and ii - l sne , based on different phase intervals for measuring the average decline rate in different optical bands , e.g. , 3.5 mag  100  d@xmath9 in @xmath10-band ( @xmath11 ) by @xcite , 0.5 mag  50  d@xmath9 in @xmath12-band ( @xmath13 ) by @xcite , again 0.5 mag  50  d@xmath9 but in @xmath14-band ( @xmath15 ) by @xcite .",
    "in addition to these sub - classes , type iin sne are distinguished due to their evolution being significantly affected by the presence of circumstellar material ( csm ) in the proximity of the star .",
    "this csm gets shocked by the ejecta , producing narrow emission lines superimposed on the sn spectrum .",
    "these narrow lines are the traits that typically identify this subclass .",
    "thus the type iin sne are classified as such purely based on their spectroscopic features .",
    "the lcs of type iin sne are usually quite heterogeneous , and depending on the masses , density and geometry of the csm , they can fall linearly or they can stay bright even for many years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed csm can be generated by pre - sn mass loss events , typical of massive progenitors @xcite or binary systems @xcite , or it can also be the result of almost static , photoionisation - confined shells created by the stellar wind of lower - mass red supergiants ( rsgs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the progenitors of type iin sne could conceivably be spread over a wide range of masses and environments . for a more thorough description on the sne classes and subclasses , including the hydrogen - poor events ,",

    ", it was discovered in the nearby galaxy ngc 3448 independently by two amateur astronomers , p. wiggins and k. itagaki , with the first detection on 2014 january 14.32 ut @xcite , and was initially reported in cbat transient object followup reports as psn j10543413 + 5417569 .",
    "a useful constraint on the explosion epoch was given by the master collaboration @xcite which reported an unfiltered limit magnitude of 19.4 in a combination of 6 exposures of the host galaxy taken on january @xmath16 ut , during routine survey mode .",
    "we then set the explosion epoch on january 12.6 ut ( mjd 56669.6 ) , with an uncertainty of @xmath171.7  d. the epoch of explosion will be taken as reference throughout the paper .",
    "our group took a classification spectrum less than a day after discovery @xcite .",
    "this showed several narrow features superimposed on a blue continuum and a comparison made with gelato @xcite gave the best match with a type iin sn . in the following days these narrow lines disappeared and the spectra started to resemble a more normal type ii sn .",
    "the photometric evolution , on the other hand , showed a monotonic decline , which led to revise the classification to a type ii - l @xcite .    at the time of writing , another paper on sn 2014 g was published ( * ? ? ?",

    "their work will be used as a useful comparison with our data and conclusions .",
    "although of minimum relevance , we point out that they set the explosion epoch on 2014 january 12.2 ut , so a minor 0.4  d discrepancy arises between our and their phase reference .    in the following , we will first briefly describe the host galaxy in section [ ngc ] . in section [ observations ] we describe the instrumentation and the reduction techniques used .",
    "we will then present the photometric and the spectroscopic evolution in sections [ photometry ] and [ spectroscopy ] respectively . finally we will discuss the results in section [ discussion ] , focusing on the physical interpretation of the data for this transient .",
    "ngc 3448 is the host galaxy of sn 2014 g and together with the dwarf companion ugc 6016 ( visible in the left panel of figure [ fig : rgb ] ) they make the system arp 205 @xcite .",

    "two higher - velocity clumps departing from the `` rigid '' component were also identified and interpreted as foreground gas clouds of tidal origins and now infalling towards the galaxy .",
    "several knots and unresolved radio sources can also be seen which are probably associated with a complex of sn remnants @xcite .",
    "ultraviolet ( uv ) and radio analyses showed that ngc 3448 is indeed a starburst galaxy . by a comparison with the nearby starburst galaxy m82 , a sn rate of one event",
    "every @xmath18 years was estimated .",
    "more recent works produced drastically lower star formation rate of 1.4 m@xmath6  yr@xmath9 @xcite , which translates to just 0.01 sn per year .",

    "this value is in good agreement with the value we measured from the narrow lines visible in the early spectra .",
    "however as the host is edge - on , and being the sn in the external part of the galaxy , its proper motion could lead to a miscalculation of the distance .",

    "_ swift _ uv observations ( bottom left panel ) started one day after discovery ( @xmath26  d after explosion ) and lasted 23  d , during which the uv bands experienced a very steep and linear decline without showing any clear initial rise .",
    "the first nir epoch , instead , was taken over one month after explosion and thus did not cover the rise time . in total , the nir observations covered @xmath27  d , but with only 5 epochs ( bottom right panel ) .",
    "focusing on the optical bands , a more complex behaviour than in uv and nir bands is evident . the early dense coverage in _ ubvrigri _ ( with first epoch being around @xmath28  d after discovery ) allowed us to accurately track the rise to maximum .",
    "fitting the curve with an order 3 polynomial , we inferred the peak epoch in different filters .",

    "in particular , the rise - time to maximum in @xmath14-band is 14.4@xmath170.4  d ( m@xmath33  mag ) , which , compared to the sample of @xcite , supports the scenario of type ii - l sne having longer rise - time and higher peak magnitudes than type ii - p .",
    "the lcs then declined linearly for @xmath34  d. measuring the decline rates following the different prescriptions used in the literature , we found , and , thus confirming that sn 2014 g comfortably matches the definitions used for type ii - l sne ( see slope limits reported in ) .",

    "the shape of the lc of sn 2014 g resembles those of sne 2009kr and 2013ej . with respect to both of these",

    "instead is striking , both in shape and luminosity , with the lcs of the two sne matching almost perfectly .",
    "the only small difference is in the radioactive tail , which is more luminous in sn 2014 g , indicating a greater amount of @xmath0ni synthesised .",
    "we notice however that sn 2014 g declines faster with respect to the @xmath0co decay ( dashed magenta line in figure [ fig : bol ] ) .",
    "one can argue that the missing flux could come from the nir contribution , which is not optimally sampled by our data at these phases .",
    "however @xcite showed that at late phases the nir contribution in type ii sne is constant in time . thus underestimating the nir contribution in sn 2014 g would translate into a solid shift of the tail but not into a change of the slope .",
    "we favour the idea that the steeper decline is due to a non - complete trapping of the @xmath1-rays from radioactive decay ( see section [ sec : ni_mass ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : col ] we show the colour evolution @xmath22 and @xmath39 of sn 2014 g , together with those of the other type ii sne considered so far , all corrected for reddening .",
    "the behaviour of all sne presented is quite similar , with a rapid increase of both colours , consistent with expectation from an expanding sn envelope . only sn",
    "1998s differs from the others , likely due to the contribution of csm - ejecta interaction that characterised this transient @xcite .",
    "the excellent match of the colour evolution of sn 2014 g with other type ii sne supports the value of reddening adopted that was derived from the na@xmath3i d ( see section [ ngc ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sp_ev ] shows the complete optical spectral evolution of sn 2014 g from the classification spectrum to the nebular phase .",

    "the lines are emissions from highly ionised carbon and nitrogen , along with hydrogen and helium , and similar features are present also in the spectra of wolf - rayet ( wr ) winds . indeed because of this coincidence , a wr progenitor star was originally proposed for sn 2013cu by @xcite",
    ". however , this interpretation was disputed by @xcite who modelled the emission lines and identified their origin in a slow dense wind or csm surrounding the precursor star when it exploded .",
    "the wind velocity was estimated as @xmath41  kms@xmath9 together with a mass loss rate of @xmath42m@xmath6yr@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite proposed that this ruled out a wr - star progenitor , and favoured a luminous blue variable ( lbv ) or yellow hypergiant ( yhg ) progenitor with a wind that was enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon ( see section [ subsec : progenitor ] ) .",

    "all the narrow emission lines disappear in the spectrum at 9.3  d and more typical type ii features start to appear since the spectrum at 16  d. after this phase , a broad dominates the spectrum , with a p - cygni profile characterised by an asymmetric emission and a shallow absorption . a couple of other balmer lines ( h@xmath45 and h@xmath1 )",

    "2014 g is somewhat reminiscent of the so - called bochum event @xcite : the emergence of a blue and a red peak in the profile of sn 1987a after 20  d. the origin of the two peaks is independent , thus the absence of the red one in sn 2014 g is not an issue .",
    "@xcite suggested that the blue peak is indeed an `` absorption deficit '' rather than an emission .",
    "this would be the result of a stratification of the hydrogen in the ejecta in 3 layers , the top and the bottom one being excited hydrogen , while the middle one would be constituted by ground state hydrogen with a low optical depth for h@xmath2 .",
    "this peculiar geometry would give rise to an emission - like feature at the velocity corresponding to the middle layer .",

    "the elapsed time between the + 187  d and the last + 342  d spectra is too long to assert , with confidence , any direct evolution of the narrow emission at @xmath54    to this `` bridge '' .",

    "we modelled the line emissions using gaussian profiles , and subtracting their contribution to the data , we obtain a flat - top feature corresponding to the `` bridge '' and also a noticeable excess of flux in the red wing of h@xmath55 .",

    "flat - top profiles are usually interpreted as the ejecta interacting with a spherical shell of csm @xcite , but it is quite unique to see two separate boxy profiles which are ( roughly ) symmetric with respect to the main emission .",

    "nevertheless , the presence of incomplete trapping is unusual for a type ii sn .",
    "it is clear from equation [ eq : c ] that the factors which can cause the incomplete trapping are essentially three : a low mass of the ejecta , a high kinetic energies or peculiar density profiles .",
    "@xcite already found a significant number of type ii sne with a @xmath12-band declining faster than the @xmath0co decay ( with full trapping ) .",
    "they attributed this behaviour to low - mass and highly - diluted ejecta , which would be unable to completely trap the @xmath1-rays .",
    "since type ii - l sne are supposed to arise from progenitors with rarefied envelopes @xcite , this could be a plausible scenario for sn 2014 g .",
    "in addition to this , from figure [ fig : lin_temp ] , sn 2014 g appears to have faster ejecta than the other sne considered , possibly suggesting a particularly energetic event.equation [ eq : trapping ] is appropriate if the ni is in the centre of the ejecta .",
    "however , if there is strong mixing , and a considerable amount of ni is spread out in the outer layers of the ejecta , then the @xmath1-rays of the decay would have higher escape probability , and would then heat the surrounding material less efficiently , decreasing the luminosity .",

    "the feature could also be simply the result of asymmetries in the ejecta , such as we argued for h@xmath2 .",
    "however , in this case the excess is in the red , in contrast to where the stronger asymmetric component was shifted bluewards .",
    "nevertheless , we see that the line has also an asymmetric red shoulder .",
    "so we attempted to fit the [ ca@xmath3ii ] feature using a doublet composed of two lines with the same velocity profile as observed in the single line .",
    "alternatively , we fitted the whole feature with multiple gaussian profiles , including specifically lines at @xmath437378 and @xmath437412 representing [ ni@xmath3ii].the first method did not give a satisfactory fit and we then conclude that the red shoulder of the [ ca ] doublet is better fit with an additional feature of [ ni@xmath3ii ] ( cfr .",

    "a similar interpretation was given by @xcite , and they conclude that the early - time wr - like spectrum has little to do with the spectral type of the progenitor before explosion .",
    "in fact n - rich nebulae can also be found around evolved massive stars occupying the upper hertzsprung - russell diagram @xcite .",
    "a sample of spectroscopy from young type ii sne by @xcite has recently been published showing that about 14 per cent of all type ii sne which have spectra available within 10 days of explosion have these high ionisation features present .",
    "they also suggest that the sne with these features tend to have brighter peak magnitudes than average for type ii sne and sn 2014 g would fit well with that picture .",
    "although we present one object , in comparison to the sample of 12 of @xcite , our comprehensive dataset allows us to track this sn into its latest stages to probe the nucleosynthesis within the progenitor and estimate its mass . from the modelling of the lc ,",
    "b16 inferred a progenitor radius of 630  r@xmath6 .",
    "therefore the progenitor of sn 2014 g was likely to be an extended supergiant star , with at least part of its h - rich envelope left at the time of explosion .",
    "current theories for the progenitors of type ii - l involve a more extended less - massive hydrogen envelope with respect to type ii - p sne progenitors @xcite , and many aspects of sn 2014 g favour this scenario .",
    "first of all , the lc in the photospheric phase points towards a more diluted envelope , unable to sustain a flat luminosity plateau .",
    "secondly , the faster decline of the radioactive tail with respect to complete trapping of @xmath1-rays from @xmath0co decay suggests less - dense ejecta .",
    "this is also consistent with the blue - shift of the emission of sn 2014 g , which shows a blue - shifted emission up to 5000 km  s@xmath9 at 25  d and settles close to zero velocity already around 65  d. in fact @xcite showed that the blue - shift should be higher in the early spectra for objects with more extended envelopes , and it should also evolve towards rest frame zero velocity much faster than for more compact objects .",

    "the @xmath107m@xmath6 estimated by us might indicate a mass loss between 5 and 11  m@xmath6 , from zams to the explosion .",
    "the `` classical '' empirical mass loss rate for rsgs given by @xcite predicts that progenitors up to @xmath108m@xmath6 should retain enough mass to produce a type ii - p sn .",
    "more recent works , however , showed how rsg stars could have experience much higher mass loss in their main sequence phase than previously thought , with several observations supporting this statement @xcite .",
    "the mechanism at the origin of this enhanced mass loss is not clear , with pulsation - driven superwinds @xcite or super - eddington luminosities in the outer layers of the star @xcite as two possible physical reasons . in the former scenario ,",
    "@xcite find pulsations to occur from a m@xmath104 of 17  m@xmath6 , and they also infer that a 20  m@xmath6 zams progenitor would end its life as a yellow supergiant ( ysg ) of 6.1  m@xmath6 , 0.5  m@xmath6 of which is hydrogen .",
    "@xcite instead worked on models with enhanced mass loss due to the luminosity in the external layers exceeding the eddington limit . from their rotating models of zams stars of 15 and 20  m@xmath6 they inferred a mass of @xmath109 and 7  m@xmath6 respectively at the end of carbon burning phase . according to these simulations then , the 17  m@xmath6 m@xmath104 progenitor of sn 2014 g inferred in this work could have reasonably led to a pre - explosion progenitor of only 9  m@xmath6 , as the one inferred by b16 . without direct observations of the progenitor we can not discriminate between a rsg or a ysg .",
    "several type ii sne have observational evidence for ysg progenitors @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed how these ysg progenitors could actually be the end of the evolution of rsg stars with enhanced mass loss , which may qualitatively match our observations for sn 2014 g .",
    "we also have to take into consideration that a companion star in a close - binary system could also have been the culprit for the mass loss , through a roche lobe overflow .",
    "@xcite showed how the mass loss in close binary for a zams star of 17  m@xmath6 could have been much more extreme , leaving a star of only @xmath110  m@xmath6 .",
    "a fine tuning of distance@xmath111mass ratio between the two stars could easily be able to reproduce the inferred mass loss @xcite . in section [ sec : halfa ]",
    "we suggest that an highly asymmetric csm was the origin of the atypical profile , which could be consistent with mass loss events in binary systems .",
    "both of these scenarios put strong constraints on current explosion theories , and the growing number of sne with measured explosive burning products from nebular spectra gives hope for progress in understanding how ccsne explode .",
    "we presented _ uvoir _ photometry and optical spectroscopy for the type ii - l sn 2014 g up to 342  d after explosion .",
    "our detailed dataset allowed us to investigate many different aspects of its evolution from very early after explosion to observations deep into the nebular phase .",
    "the early spectra show narrow emission lines that disappear by day 9 .",
    "these high ionisation lines have been seen in other sne of types ii - p / l and iib and suggest that the csm surrounding the star is photo - ionised by uv emission at shock breakout .",
    "this study shows one example in which they exist in type ii - l sne , and persist to at least 3  d after explosion and disappear by about 10 days .",
    "one should be careful with classifications that are based on such early spectra , as a iin classification would typically result .",
    "the lc then evolved like a canonical type ii - l , with a linear decay of the lc lasting until @xmath46  d after explosion .",
    "the radioactive tail appeared to fall more rapidly than the @xmath0co decay with full trapping .",
    "we interpreted this as a leakage of @xmath1-rays , possibly due to more diluted external layers of the ejecta and high levels of mixing .",
    "taking into account the missing flux , we were able to infer a @xmath0ni mass of @xmath73  m@xmath6 .",
    "we further presented extensive late - time spectral coverage of sn 2014 g offering further insights into the progenitor and explosion . became optically thin already at 100  d",
    ", the spectra showed an early [ o@xmath3i ] doublet and an intriguing narrow emission between these two lines , which evolved later into a wider and flat - topped boxy profile .",
    "we interpreted this feature as the interaction of the outer hydrogen rich ejecta with a strongly asymmetric csm .",
    "we computed a combined line profile of h@xmath2 in the 342  d spectrum with the sums of multiple individual velocity components .",
    "we showed some evidence that there are two broad , boxy features roughly symmetrically distributed at either side of zero velocity that would explain the complex region .",
    "this symmetry led us to infer a strongly bipolar csm geometry , with one of the lobes oriented toward us , at angle of @xmath61 with the observer line of sight . in the last spectrum the [ ca@xmath3ii ]",
    "@xmath57291,7323 doublet shows a distinct flux excess on the red side .",
    "we found this flux excess consistent with the presence of emission lines , which we identified as [ ni@xmath3ii ] . applying a semi - analytical line formation method",
    ", we were able to infer a ni / fe production ratio , obtaining a value of 0.18 , 3 times higher than the solar ratio .",
    "finally we investigated and discussed the nature of the progenitor .",
    "we compared the nebular spectra with the models of j14 , focusing on the flux of the [ o@xmath3i ] @xmath112 doublet . from this comparison",
    ", we inferred a progenitor with a zams mass of 17  m@xmath6 . from the lc modelling , b16 inferred a progenitor with an ejecta mass of 9  m@xmath6 , thus our result implies an extensive mass loss of the progenitor during its life .",
    "therefore , the progenitor of sn 2014 g was likely to be a rsg or ysg which experienced extensive mass loss .",
    "traces of the mass loss are the photo - ionised metal - rich csm inferable from the early spectra and the hints of interaction visible in the late ones .",
    "such extensive mass loss left the progenitor with a low - mass and highly diluted envelope .",
    "overall , sn 2014 g is supporting the current theories of type ii - l sne arising from massive hydrogen - depleted stars .",

    "then the escape probability are equal to 1 and thus we can write @xmath127 measuring the luminosity of the two ni lines , then , we could have another estimate of the temperature .",
    "so we untied the bond on the two ni lines luminosity ratios fixed in the previous analysis and redid the fit ( note that doing this we added a parameter to the fit ) .",
    "we inferred a ratio of @xmath128 ( compare to the previous fixed 0.31 ) which gives the extremely high value of @xmath129  k. this happens because equation [ eq : ni / ni ] has the shape of an hyperbola with an horizontal asymptote at @xmath130 ; then when this ratio is above 0.4 ( which happens roughly at ) the temperature starts to raise exponentially .",
    "moreover for values the temperatures become negative .",
    "sn 2012ec had a very weak [ ca@xmath3ii ] which made the [ ni@xmath3ii ] @xmath437378 line the most prominent feature of this spectral region . in our case the [ ca@xmath3ii ] doublet was much more intense , and the whole structure was still too blended in order to easily detach every single feature , despite the low number of free parameters in the fit .",
    "this resulted in an unreliable measurement of the flux of the ni lines and therefore in an unreliable estimate of the temperature @xmath96 with this method .",
    "here we report the complete dataset of our measurements .",
