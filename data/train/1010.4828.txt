    "both the van der waals and casimir forces are quantum phenomena originating from the interaction of electromagnetic fluctuations with matter .",
    "one difference between them is that the van der waals force is nonrelativistic , whereas the casimir force takes full account of the relativistic retardation effects .",
    "thus , in fact there exists just one force of a fluctuation nature . at shortest sepatations up to a few nanometers between the interacting bodies , where retardation is negligibly small , it is referred to as the _ van der waals _ force . at larger separations",
    "it is called the _ casimir _",
    "force @xcite .",
    "the casimir force becomes significantly large if measured at separations below one micrometer . at separations below 100",
    "nm it competes with characteristic electric forces acting between the constituting elements of microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical devices .",
    "the attractive casimir force leads to pull - in and stiction @xcite which may result in the collapse of a microdevice .",
    "that is why the casimir force has attracted much recent attention in nanotechnology . on the one hand",
    ", it can be used as an actuating force @xcite in place of electric forces . on the other hand",
    ", it plays the role of some kind friction in micrometer scales which can not be diminished by means of lubrication . in this respect ,",
    "the possibility of repulsive casimir force attracts much public attention as the mean to cancel this friction .",
    "it is commonly known that the unified description of both the van der waals and casimir forces is given by the lifshitz theory @xcite . during more than fourty years after",
    "this theory was created it was lacking detailed experimental confirmation due to the absence of sufficiently precise measurements . during the last decade ,",
    "however , many experiments measuring the casimir force have been performed ( see the recent review @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison between the measurement data of the most precise experiments and computational results on the basis of the lifshitz theory has led to a puzzle .",
    "it turned out that the lifshitz theory is in agreement with the data only under a condition that for metallic test bodies the relaxation properties of conduction electrons are not accounted for , whereas for dielectrics charge carriers are completely discarded ( controversial discussions concerning these results are reflected in ref .",
    "modern overview of both experimental and theoretical aspects of the casimir force can be found in the monograph @xcite .",
    "the present paper reviews several recent experimental and theoretical results in the casimir effect which are of much importance for understanding of delicate physical mechanisms of fluctuation - induced forces and for their technological application in new generations of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems . in sec .  2 we briefly discuss the standard formalism of the lifshitz theory , its generalization for the case of nonplanar geometries , and modifications aimed to resolve the above - mentioned puzzle .",

    "calculation of the casimir force between real material bodies using the lifshitz theory requires the availability of the respective @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we reserve the discussion of @xmath24 for sec .  4 and briefly consider here the dielectric permittivity for dielectrics and metals .",
    "it is common knowledge that all condensed bodies are either dielectrics or metals depending on the behavior of their dc conductivity @xmath40 when temperature vanishes @xcite . for dielectrics @xmath41",
    "whereas for metals @xmath42 . in this regard semiconductors are also either dielectrics or metals ( specifically , intrinsic semiconductors are dielectrics , whereas doped semiconductors with dopant concentration above the critical value are metals ) . in the application of the lifshitz theory to dielectric materials the small dc conductivity arising at @xmath43",
    "is usually neglected . in so doing the dielectric permittivities of dielectric plates",
    "are determined by the core electrons @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the oscillator frequencies , @xmath46 are the oscillator strengths , @xmath47 are the damping parameters , and @xmath48 is the number of oscillators .",
    "note that the parameters of oscillators in eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) can be temperature - dependent .",
    "thus , in addition to the explicit dependence on the temperature in eqs .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) through the multiple @xmath1 and through the matsubara frequencies , there is an implicit dependence through the dielectric permittivity .",

    "the casimir entropy jumps abruptly to zero at @xmath63k starting from a negative value ( [ eq14a ] ) , so that the nernst theorem is formully satisfied @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not solve the problem .",
    "the point is that a perfect crystal lattice is a truly equilibrium system with a nondegenerate dynamical state of the lowest energy .",
    "thus , according to quantum statistical physics , the casimir entropy calculated for a perfect crystal lattice must be equal to zero @xcite .",
    "it is quite another matter when the nondissipative plasma model @xmath64 is used instead of ( [ eq13 ] ) to describe metallic plates . in this case",
    "the nernst heat theorem is satisfied @xcite , i.e. @xmath65 when @xmath51 .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that the inclusion of relaxation properties of free charge carriers in the model of dielectric response violates thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory .",
    "this is because the drift electric current leads to a violation of time - reversal symmetry and requires the introduction of the unidirectional flux of heat from the casimir plates to the heat reservoir to preserve the temperature constant .",
    "consensus on the problem of why the lifshitz theory is thermodynamically inconsistent in the presence of free charge carriers is not yet achieved .    to complete a brief survey of the lifshitz theory , we mention recent attempts to modify the tm reflection coefficients by taking into account the effect of screening @xcite .",
    "this approach includes both the drift and diffusion currents of free charge carriers .",
    "eventually the modified tm reflection coefficient is obtained through the use of boltzmann transport equation and takes the form @xcite @xmath66 here , the dielectric permittivities of the plates are given by @xmath67 where permittivities of the bound core electrons @xmath68 are defined in eq .",

    "the te reflection coefficient in the proposed approach remains unchanged .",
    "it was shown @xcite , however , that the modification of the tm reflection coefficient in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ eq16 ] ) also leads to the violation of the nernst theorem for all dielectric materials whose charge carrier density does not vanish when @xmath51 and @xmath40 vanishes due to the vanishing mobility ( for instance , for glasses with ionic conductivity @xcite or doped semiconductors with dopant concentration below the critical value @xcite ) . for metals with perfect crystal lattices",
    "the lifshitz theory with the modified tm reflection coefficient violates the nernst theorem in the same way as when the standard drude model approach is used @xcite .",
    "these conclusions were disputed in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the argumentation used was shown to be inadequate in refs .",
    "therefore , the problem of consistency of the lifshitz theory with thermodynamics for real materials remains unsolved .",
    "there are about 25 experiments on measuring the casimir force in the modern stage of the work on the subject ( see the review @xcite for more details ) . in almost all experiments",
    "at least an attempt of comparing the measurement data with theory was undertaken . in this section ,",
    "we consider only three experiments each of which , when carefully compared with the lifshitz theory , leads to unexpected conclusions .",
    "the first of this landmark experiments was performed by r.  s.  decca and his co - workers .",
    "it was repeated three times , in 2003 @xcite , 2005 @xcite , and in 2007 @xcite with major improvements in sample preparation and in the experimental precision in each repetition .",
    "the discussion below is related to the most precise experiment of 2007 @xcite , where the gradient of the casimir force between an au - coated sphere of @xmath72 m radius and a plate of micromachined oscillator was measured at @xmath73k in the dynamic regime ( see fig .  1 for the schematic diagram of a setup ) .",
    "in fact it was the shift of the resonant frequency of a micromachined oscillator that was measured .",
    "this shift is proportional to the gradient of the casimir force between a sphere and a plate . considering the negative derivative with respect to @xmath0 of both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , one obtains @xmath74 thus , the use of the pfa allows interpretation of the experiment by decca et al . as an indirect measurement of the casimir pressure between two parallel plates . in this experiment",
    "all errors were determined at a 95% confidence level , and the random errors were made much less than the systematic errors , so that only the latter determined the total experimental error . as a result , the total relative experimental error of the casimir pressure varied from 0.19% at @xmath75 nm to 0.9% at @xmath76 nm and to 9.0% at the largest separation @xmath77 nm .",
    "this includes the error of the pfa which was used to recalculate the experimental data for the gradient of the casimir force into the casimir pressure . in the most conservative way the error of the pfa was taken to be equal to @xmath32 ( specially performed experiment @xcite and theoretical computations @xcite for a sphere and a plate made of real metals described by the plasma and drude models",

    "the period of corrugations was equal to @xmath202 nm , i.e. , much larger than the separation between the sphere and the plate .",

    "besides fundamental interest in the phenomenon of lateral casimir force as one more manifestation of the zero - point oscillations of electromagnetic field , it is pertinent to note that this version of the casimir force gives the possibility to actuate lateral translations of corrugated surfaces in micromachines .",
    "the lateral casimir force might be used to solve the tribological problems plaguing the microdevice industry .",
    "specifically , it was proposed to use this effect for the frictionless transmission of lateral motion by means of a nanoscale rack and pinion without intermeshing cogs @xcite or in a ratchet with asymmetric corrugations driven by the casimir force @xcite .",
    "such devices could be used for transfering motion between two microelectromechanical systems without mechanical contact .",
    "the experimental and theoretical results on the lateral casimir force discussed above bring us closer to the realization of micromachines driven by the zero - point fluctuations of quantum vacuum .",
    "in the foregoing , we have listed several experiments and theoretical advances in the casimir effect which has come to the center of public attention very recently .",
    "the casimir effect deals with quantum vacuum , which is the most fundamental and puzzling type of physical reality .",
    "this is a possible reason why the research area in this field is so wide . on the one hand , it is closely connected with foundations of quantum statistical physics and even calls for reconsideration of some of its basic concepts . on the other hand , the casimir effect quickly turns into a practical tool of nanotechnology which is expected to find numerous applications in the next generation of microdevices .    as was discussed in sec .  2 , the fundamental lifshitz theory of the van der waals and casimir forces comes into conflict with basics of thermodynamics when the relaxation properties of free charge carriers are taken into account . in sec .  3 ,",
    "the three landmark recently performed experiments are described demonstrating that in a literal sense , the lifshitz theory is in a deep contradiction with the measurement data .",
    "only if we accept the phenomenological prescription that for dielectrics charge carriers are disregarded and for metals they are described by the plasma model , the theoretical predictions of the lifshitz theory come in agreement with the data .",
    "this situation can not be considered as satisfactory .",
    "in fact we deal with some kind of a paradox .",
    "the mathematical formalism of the lifshitz theory during the last few years has undergone far reaching generalization discussed in secs .  2 and 5 .",
    "it is presently possible to write the lifshitz - type formulas for compact objects of arbitrary shape in terms of reflection amplitudes of electromagnetic oscillations on their surfaces .",
    "based on this it was even believed that at the present time computation of the casimir force between any bodies is only a problem of sufficient computer facilities . as was argued in secs .  2 and 3",
    ", the problem is , however , much deeper .",
    "in fact the reflection amplitudes suggested by our knowledge of physical processes with real ( not fluctuating ) electromagnetic fields lead to computational results in contradiction with the experimental data making powerful mathematical formalism at least insufficient .",
    "this is a fundamental problem to be solved in the future .    from the point of view of applications in nanotechnology , large progress on the control the magnitude of the casimir force",
    "was achieved .",
    "this was done by means of a modification of dielectric properties by using different materials and different influential factors such as irradiation with laser light . in several experiments considered in sec .",
    "4.1 it was possible to modify the magnitude of the casimir force from a few percent to about 50% .",
    "there were several proposals on how to achieve the casimir repulsion through the vacuum gap , but to the present day the casimir repulsion was realized only in the familiar three - layer system .",
    "one more opportunity to control the magnitude of the casimir force is suggested by phase transitions . in sec .",
    "4.1 we have discussed the phase transition from dielectric to the metallic state .",
    "a few tens of percent variation in the magnitude of the casimir force is achievable under a phase transition of the plate material .",
    "quick progress in the application of the casimir force in nanotechnology might be caused by the use of ferromagnetic materials .",
    "for real material properties this subject was investigated only recently ( see sec .",
    "what is most striking , according to the lifshitz theory the casimir interaction of a nonmagnetic metallic plate described by the plasma model with a ferromagnetic dielectric plate through the vacuum gap becomes repulsive under some conditions .",
    "this effect , if exists in nature , opens up the way for the developments of various microdevices .",
    "we should notice , however , that the influence of magnetic properties on the casimir interaction is not yet confirmed experimentally .",
    "the confirmation or exclusion of such an influence is expected in the near future .",
    "one more opportunity for applications in nanotechnology is suggested by the lateral casimir force discussed in sec .",
    "5 . together with the normal casimir force",
    ", it gives the possibility to actuate both normal and lateral translations of corrugated surfaces in micromachines by means of the electromagnetic zero - point oscillations .",
    "with respect to tribological problems , the lateral casimir force allows frictionless transition of lateral motion .",
    "all the above allows to conclude that the casimir effect promises important breakthroughs in both fundamental physics and its applications in nanotechnology .",

    "<S> we discuss recent experimental and theoretical results on the casimir force between real material bodies made of different materials . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to calculations of the normal casimir force acting perpendicular to the surface with the help of the lifshitz theory taking into account the role of free charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical results for the thermal casimir force acting between metallic , dielectric and semiconductor materials are presented and compared with available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> main attention is concentrated on the possibility to control the magnitude and sign of the casimir force for applications in nanotechnology . in this respect </S>",
    "<S> we consider experiments on the optical modulation of the casimir force between metal and semiconductor test bodies with laser light . </S>",
    "<S> another option is the use of ferromagnetic materials , specifically , ferromagnetic dielectrics . under some conditions this allows to get casimir repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the lateral casimir force acting between sinusoidally corrugated surfaces can be considered as some kind of noncontact friction caused by zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments and computations using the exact theory have demonstrated the role of diffraction - type effects in this phenomenon and the possibility to get asymmetric force profiles . </S>",
    "<S> conclusion is made that the casimir force may play important role in the operation of different devices on the nanoscale . </S>"
