    "computing distances between shapes of open or closed curves is of interest in many applications , from medical imaging to radar signal processing , as soon as one wants to compare , classify or statistically analyze trajectories or contours of objects .",
    "while the shape of an organ or the trajectory of an object on a short distance can be modeled by a curve in the plane @xmath7 or in the ambient space @xmath8 , some applications provide curves in an intrinsically non - flat space .",
    "simple examples in positive curvature include trajectories on the sphere where points represent positions on the earth , and a space of interest in negative curvature is the hyperbolic half plane , which as we will explain later coincides with the statistical manifold of gaussian densities .",
    "we are motivated by the study of curves in the latter for signal processing purposes , however our framework is more general .",

    "a property that is usually required of this metric is reparametrization invariance , that is that the metric be the same at all points of @xmath5 representing curves that are identical modulo reparametrization .",
    "two curves are identical modulo reparametrization when they pass through the same points of @xmath0 but at different speeds .",

    "this motivates the choice of a reparametrization invariant metric on @xmath5 .",
    "riemannian metrics on the space of curves lying in the euclidean space @xmath43 , and especially closed curves @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the circle ) , have been widely studied ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the most natural candidate for a reparametrization invariant metric is the @xmath4-metric with integration over arc length @xmath46 @xmath47 but michor and mumford have shown in @xcite that the induced metric on the shape space always vanishes . this has motivated the study of sobolev - type metrics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , where higher order derivatives are introduced .",
    "local existence and uniqueness of geodesics for first and second - order sobolev metrics on the space of closed plane curves were shown in @xcite and completion results were given in @xcite .",
    "one first - order sobolev metric where different weights are given to the tangential and normal parts of the derivative has proved particularly interesting for the applications ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath48 in that case @xmath17 is a curve in @xmath43 , @xmath49 denotes the euclidean metric on @xmath50 , @xmath51 is the derivation of @xmath52 according to arc length , @xmath53 is the projection of @xmath54 on the unit speed vector field @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",
    "this metric belongs to the class of so - called elastic metrics , defined for any weights @xmath57 as @xmath58 the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively control the degree of bending and stretching of the curve .",
    "srivastava et al .",
    "introduced in @xcite a convenient framework to study the case where @xmath61 and @xmath62 by showing that metric could be obtained by pullback of the @xmath4-metric via a simple transformation @xmath63 called the square root velocity function ( srvf ) , which associates to each curve its velocity renormalized by the square root of its norm .",
    "a similar idea had been previously introduced in @xcite and then used in @xcite , where a sobolev metric is also mapped to an @xmath4-metric .",
    "the general elastic metric @xmath64 with weights @xmath59 and @xmath60 satisfying @xmath65 can also be studied using a generalization of the srvf @xcite , however the formulas get rather involved .",
    "the srv framework can be extended to curves in a general manifold by using parallel transport , in a way which allows us to move the computations to the tangent space to the origin of one of the two curves under comparison @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in @xcite",
    "this is done for the general elastic metric @xmath64 , but no riemannian framework is given . in @xcite ,",
    "a riemannian framework is given for the case @xmath61 , @xmath66 , and the geodesic equations are derived . in this paper",
    "we also restrict to this particular choice of coefficients @xmath59 and @xmath60 for simplicity , but we propose another generalization of the srv framework to manifold - valued curves . instead of encoding the information of each curve within a tangent space at a single point as in @xcite and @xcite , the distance is computed in the manifold itself which enables us to be more directly dependent on its geometry .",
    "intuitively , the data of each curve is no longer concentrated at any one point , and so the energy of the deformation between two curves takes into account the curvature of the manifold along the entire `` deformation surface '' , not just along the path traversed by the starting point of the curve .    in the following section ,",
    "we introduce our metric as the pullback of a quite natural metric on the tangent bundle @xmath12 , and show that it induces a fiber bundle structure over the manifold @xmath0 seen as the set of starting points of the curves . in section @xmath67 ,",
    "we give the induced geodesic distance and highlight the difference with respect to the distance introduced in @xcite . in section 4 , we give the geodesic equations associated to our metric and exploit them to build the exponential map .",
    "geodesics of the space of curves can then be computed using geodesic shooting . to this end",
    ", we describe the jacobi fields on @xmath5 .",
    "we test these algorithms on curves lying in the hyperbolic half - plane , a choice that we motivate in section 5 .",
    "finally , in the setting of spectral analysis of locally stationary radar signals , we compute the mean of curves in that space constructed from radar data .",
    "let @xmath9 \\rightarrow m$ ] be a curve in @xmath0 and @xmath15 two infinitesimal deformations .",
    "we consider the following first - order sobolev metric on @xmath5 @xmath68 where we integrate according to arc length @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively denote the riemannian metric and the associated levi - civita connection of the manifold @xmath0 , @xmath72 is the covariant derivative of @xmath52 according to arc length , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are its tangential and normal components respectively , with the notation @xmath75 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a flat euclidean space , we obtain the metric studied in @xcite , with an added term involving the origins . without this extra term , the bilinear form @xmath11 is not definite since it vanishes if @xmath52 or @xmath76 is covariantly constant along @xmath17 .",
    "here we show that @xmath11 can be obtained as the pullback of a very natural metric @xmath77 on the tangent bundle @xmath12 .",
    "we consider the square root velocity function ( srvf , introduced in @xcite ) on the space of curves in @xmath0 , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the norm associated to the riemannian metric on @xmath0 . in order to define @xmath77 , we introduce the following projections from @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83 be a curve in @xmath81 that passes through @xmath84 at time @xmath85 at speed @xmath86 .",
    "then we define the vertical and horizontal projections @xmath87 the horizontal and vertical projections live in the tangent bundle @xmath88 and are not to be confused with the horizontal and vertical parts which live in the double tangent bundle @xmath80 and will be denoted by @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , let us point out that the horizontal projection is simply the differential of the natural projection @xmath91 , and that according to these definitions , a very natural metric on the tangent bundle @xmath88 , the sasaki metric ( @xcite , @xcite ) , can be written @xmath92 where @xmath49 denotes the riemannian metric on @xmath0 .",

    "in all the paper we use the notations @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as well as @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "then @xmath112 where in the last step we use again the inversion @xmath113 .",
    "this choice of metric induces two fiber bundle structures .",
    "while the second one is an actual fiber bundle structure between two manifolds , the first structure is over the shape space which , as discussed in the introduction , is not a manifold , and so it should be understood formally .",
    "note that we could obtain a manifold structure by restricting ourselves to so - called `` free '' immersions , that is elements of @xmath5 on which the diffeomorphism group acts freely , see @xcite .",
    "just as in the planar case , the fact that the square root velocity function @xmath63 satisfies @xmath114 for all @xmath115 , @xmath20 and @xmath21)$ ] , guarantees that the integral part of @xmath11 is reparametrization invariant .",
    "remembering that the reparametrizations @xmath116)$ ] preserve the origins of the curves , we notice that @xmath11 is constant along the fibers and verifies the equivariance property .",
    "we then have a formal principal bundle structure over the shape space @xmath117,m ) \\rightarrow \\mathcal{s}=\\mathcal{m}/ \\text{diff}^+([0,1]).\\ ] ] which induces a decomposition @xmath118 .",
    "there exists a riemannian metric @xmath34 on the shape space @xmath31 such that @xmath119 is ( formally ) a riemannian submersion from @xmath120 to @xmath121 @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the horizontal parts of @xmath52 and @xmath76 , as well as the horizontal lifts of @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively .",

    "the special role played by the starting point in the metric @xmath11 induces another fiber bundle structure , where the base space is the manifold @xmath0 , seen as the set of starting points of the curves , and the fibers are composed of the curves which have the same origin .",

    "let @xmath52 be a tangent vector .",
    "consider @xmath133 the parallel vector field along @xmath17 with initial value @xmath134 .",
    "it is a horizontal vector , since its vanishing covariant derivative along @xmath17 assures that for any vertical vector @xmath135 we have @xmath136 .",
    "the difference @xmath137 between those two vectors has initial value @xmath85 and so it is a vertical vector , which gives a decomposition of @xmath52 into a horizontal vector and a vertical vector . the definition of @xmath138 as the orthogonal complement of @xmath139 guaranties that their sum is direct . now",
    "if @xmath76 is another tangent vector , then the scalar product between their horizontal parts is @xmath140 and this completes the proof .",
    "here we give an expression of the geodesic distance induced by the metric @xmath11 .",
    "we show that it can be written similarly to the product distance given in @xcite and @xcite , with an added curvature term .",

    "if instead we equip the tangent bundle @xmath2 with the metric @xmath170 for @xmath171 and @xmath172 , then the curvature term @xmath166 vanishes and the geodesic distance on @xmath3 becomes @xmath173 which corresponds exactly to the geodesic distance introduced by zhang et al . in @xcite on the space @xmath174,t_pm)$ ] .",
    "the difference between the two distances and resides in the curvature term @xmath166 , which measures the holonomy along the rectangle of infinitesimal width shown in figure [ fig : dist ] , and arises from the fact that in the first one , we compute the distance in the manifold , whereas in the second , it is computed in the tangent space to one of the origins of the curves .",
    "therefore , the first one takes more directly into account the `` relief '' of the manifold between the two curves under comparison .",
    "for example , if there is a `` bump '' between two curves in an otherwise relatively flat space , the second distance might not see it , whereas the first one should thanks to the curvature term .",

    "if two @xmath43-valued curves differ only by a translation , then the distance is simply the distance between their origins .",
    "note that this distance is only local in general .    since @xmath11 is defined by pullback of @xmath77 by the srvf @xmath63 , we know that the lengths of @xmath17 in @xmath3 and of @xmath179 in @xmath2 are equal and so that @xmath180 with @xmath181 to obtain the second expression of this distance we need to express @xmath182 as a function of the derivative @xmath183 .",

    "<S> this paper focuses on the study of open curves in a riemannian manifold @xmath0 , and proposes a reparametrization invariant metric on the space of such paths . </S>",
    "<S> we use the square root velocity function ( srvf ) introduced by srivastava et al . in @xcite to define a riemannian metric on the space of immersions @xmath1,m)$ ] by pullback of a natural metric on the tangent bundle @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this induces a first - order sobolev metric on @xmath3 and leads to a distance which takes into account the distance between the origins in @xmath0 and the @xmath4-distance between the srv representations of the curves . </S>",
    "<S> the geodesic equations for this metric are given and exploited to define an exponential map on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal deformation of one curve into another can then be constructed using geodesic shooting , which requires to characterize the jacobi fields of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the particular case of curves lying in the hyperbolic half - plane @xmath6 is considered as an example , in the setting of radar signal processing . </S>"
