    "the dynamics of an incompressible fluid in an homogeneous and isotropic porous media is modeled by the following system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the density , @xmath3 is the incompressible velocity field , @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 is the viscosity , @xmath6 is the permeability of the media and @xmath7 is the gravity .",
    "the first equation represents the mass conservation law , equation the incompressibility of the fluid and equation is darcy s law , which relates the velocity of the fluid with the forces acting on it . in this paper",
    "we will consider @xmath8 .",
    "as usual , we will refer to the system , and as the ipm system .",
    "the muskat problem deals with two incompressible and immiscible fluids in a porous media with different constant densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 and different constant viscosities . in this work",
    "we will focus on the case in which both fluids have the same viscosity .",
    "then one can obtain the following system of equations from ipm @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the restriction of the velocity to the interface , @xmath13 , between both fluids , @xmath14 is the normal unit vector to @xmath15 pointing out of @xmath16 , @xmath17 is a unit tangential vector to @xmath15 , @xmath18 is the domain occupied by the fluid with density @xmath19 and therefore @xmath20 . without any lost of generality we will take from now on @xmath21 .",
    "the same system of equations governs an interface separating two fluids trapped between two closely spaced parallel vertical plates ( a `` helle shaw cell '' ) .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we also assume that @xmath22 is open and simple connected , that there exist a constant @xmath23 such that @xmath24 ( the fluid with density @xmath9 is below ) and that the interface @xmath25 is asymptotically flat at infinity with @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "this type of initial data will be called _ of muskat type_.    in this situation one can find an equation for the interface between the two fluids . indeed ,",
    "if we take the parametrization @xmath28 the curve @xmath29 must satisfy ( see @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the principal value integral .",
    "in addition , by solving these equations yields a solution to the muskat problem . at the same time the solutions of the muskat problem",
    "are weak solutions of the ipm system .",
    "the behaviour of the equation strongly depend on the order of the densities @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the problem is locally well possed in sobolev spaces , @xmath32 ( see @xcite ) , if the interface is a graph and @xmath33 , i.e. stable regime ( see also @xcite and @xcite for improvements of the regularity ) .",
    "otherwise , we are in the unstable regime and the problem is ill - possed in @xmath34 .",
    "this is a consequence of the instant analyticity proved in @xcite in the stable case ( see also @xcite for ill - possedness in @xmath32 for an small initial data ) .",
    "this behaviour is easy to believe since @xmath35 satisfies that @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are lower order terms and the rayleigh - taylor function @xmath40 reads @xmath41 a quick analogy with the heat equation indicates that for @xmath40 positive everywhere the problem is well - possed ( we are in the stable case ) .",
    "if @xmath40 is negative the equation resembles a backwards heat equation in this region and therefore instabilities arise .",
    "however , in the present paper , we show that there exists weak solutions to the ipm system starting with an initial data of muskat type in the fully unstable regime , i.e. , @xmath42 and @xmath43 everywhere .",
    "the initial interface will have sobobev regularity and in addition these solutions will have the following structure : there will exist domains @xmath44 where the density will be equal to @xmath19 and a mixing domain @xmath45 such that for every space - time ball contained in the mixing area the density will take both values @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will call these solutions mixing solutions ( see the forthcoming definition  [ mixing ] ) . in figures [ figuresin ] and [ mixingsolution ] we present the main features of this kind of solutions .",
    "[ figuresin ]      starting in the configuration of fig .",
    "[ figuresin],width=377,height=302 ]    .",
    "[ mixingsolution ]    [ thmmain]let @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath25 is run from left to right and that @xmath48 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath42",
    ". then there exist infinitely many `` mixing solutions '' starting with the inital data of muskat type given by @xmath25 ( in the fully unstable regime ) for the ipm system .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the initial interface has sobolev regularity , thus the muskat problem is ill - possed in the hadamard sense ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the creation of a mixing zone provides a mechanism to solve the ipm system in a situation where solutions of muskat are not known .",
    "notice that these `` mixing solutions '' do not change the values that the density initially takes and that in any space - time ball @xmath49 , @xmath2 takes both values , i.e there is total mixing .",
    "the method of the proof is based on the adaptation of the method of convex integration for the incompressible euler equation in the tartar framework developed recently by delellis and szkelyhidi ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the incompressible euler and for another equations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "very briefly , the version of convex integration used initially by de lellis and szkelyhidi understands a nonlinear pde , @xmath50 as a combination of a linear system @xmath51 and a pointwise constraint @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a convenient set of states and @xmath54 is an artificial new variable",
    ". then @xmath55 gives rises to a wave cone @xmath56 and the geometry of the @xmath56 hull of @xmath53 , @xmath57 , rules whether the convex integration method will yield solutions .",
    "an h - principle holds in this context : if for a given initial data there exists an evolution which belongs to @xmath57 , called a subsolution , then one find infinitely many weak solutions .    for the case of the ipm system , in @xcite , the authors initiated this analysis and used version of the convex integration method which avoids the computation of @xmath56 hulls based on t4 configurations , key in other applications of convex integration , e.g to the ( lack of ) regularity of elliptic systems @xcite . keeping the discussion inprecise , their criteria amounts to say that @xmath58 must be in the convex hull of @xmath59 in a stable way .",
    "shvydkoy extended this approach to a general family of active scalars , where the velocity is an even singular integral operator , in @xcite .",
    "recently , in @xcite , isett and vicol using more subtle versions of convex integration show the existence of weak solution for ipm with @xmath60regularity .",
    "all of these solutions , increase the modulus of the density .",
    "we remark that the solutions in theorem  [ thmmain ] do not change the values of the density .",
    "szkelyhidi refined the result of @xcite in @xcite computing explicitly the @xmath56-hull for the case of ipm .",
    "notice that this increase the number of subsolutions ( and thus the solutions available ) .",
    "in fact , szkelyhidi showed that for the case of a flat interface in the unstable regime there exist a subsolution and thus proved theorem [ thmmain ] in this case .",
    "the main contribution of this work is a new way to construct such subsolutions , inspired by previous studies in contour dynamics , which we believe of interest in related problems .",
    "let us describe it briefly .",
    "the mixing zone ( that is where the subsolution is not a solution ) will be a neighborhood of size @xmath61 of a suitable curve @xmath29 evolving in time according to a suitable evolution equation .",
    "namely , if @xmath62 we will declare the mixing zone @xmath63 to be    @xmath64 and inside the mixing zone , the density of the subsolution will be simply @xmath65 .",
    "let us observe , that at the boundary of the mixing zone , the subsolution must become a solution ( @xmath66 ) . in order to construct a subsolution we will need to impose the following equations for @xmath29 and @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    where    @xmath69    here @xmath70 can be understood as a suitable double average of the velocity in the muskat case .",
    "it turns out that it is possible but rather difficult to obtain uniform estimates for the operator @xmath70 in order to obtain existence for this system .",
    "the situation reminds that of the muskat problem but it is different as , on one hand , the kernel is not so singular but , on the other hand , we need to obtain estimates which are independent of @xmath71 since for @xmath72 the problem is ill - posed .",
    "in fact , after regularizing the equation in various ways , the needed a priori estimate bold down to understanding the evolution of the following equation for @xmath73    @xmath74    for a suitable kernel @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are low order functions .    if we freeze coefficients , taking @xmath78 constant , the relevant multiplier is    @xmath79    it turns out that independently of @xmath80 , @xmath81 is comparable with the fourier multiplier @xmath82 . thus denoting @xmath83 we can only aim to control    @xmath84    the main goal in the proof of theorem [ thmmain ] is to bound the above quantity also in the case of . in section 4 we show how the theory of pseudo - differential operators reduced the problem to estimate two commutators @xmath85 for the @xmath86 term and @xmath87 for the transport term . to estimate these commutators",
    "is in fact the most technical part of the paper ( together with section [ coercivity ] ) and we deal with them by brute force in combination with pseudo - differential operator theory in section 5 . in the end",
    "we get an estimate of the type @xmath88 for some pseudo - differential operator @xmath89 .    furthermore ,",
    "in order to conclude the proof , we need also to show ( see section [ coercivity ] ) that @xmath90    rather pleasantly it turns out that once @xmath91 and @xmath71 are shown to exist we can find the corresponding density @xmath2 and velocity @xmath3 and show that they belong to the suitable @xmath56 hull for small time .",
    "once a subsolution is created then , by now standard machinery , convex integration applies to create a wek solution though an additional observation is needed to obtain the mixing property ( see section [ hprinciple ] ) .",
    "the method of the proof seems robust to prove existence of weak solutions in a number of free boundary problems in an unstable regime .",
    "as it was remarked by otto and szkelyhidi ( @xcite and @xcite ) the underlying subsolution seems to capture the relevant properties of the solution as it is the growing rate of the mixing zone or the volume proportion of the mixing .",
    "it seem to us that the creation of a mixing zone in the lines of this work , might end up in to a canonical way of turning ill - posed problems into well posed ones , at the price of loosing uniqueness at least at the microscopic level ( this line of thought has been already expressed in @xcite and @xcite ) . at the end of the paper",
    "we add a remark showing that surprisingly the mixing solutions are also present in the stable regime in the case of straight interfaces except in the horizontal case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce the rigorous definition of mixing solutions and subsolution . in section 3",
    "we explain how the convex integration theory allow us to obtain a mixing solution from a subsolution .",
    "section 4 is divided in two parts . in the first part , section 4.1 ,",
    "we construct a subsolution for the ipm system assuming the existence of solution for the system , . in the second part , section 4.2",
    ", we will show the existence of solutions for the system , .",
    "this proof will need some estimates that we will prove in the following sections . in section [ commutator ]",
    "we deal with the two main commutators that arise in the equation . in section [ coercivity ]",
    "we show the coercivity of a pseudo - differential operator that arises in section 4.2 . in section 7",
    "we show how to construct mixing solutions in the stable regime .",
    "finally in the appendix we prove some lemmas that will be use along the paper including , estimations of the low order term and estimations on the kernel of the main velocity @xmath70 .",
    "following @xcite we rigorously defined the concept of `` mixing solution '' in the statement of theorem  [ thmmain ] .",
    "we would like our solutions to mix in every ball of the domain and thus we incorporate this into the definition .",
    "firstly , since we are working in unbounded domains , we give a definition of weak solution in which we prescribed the behaviour of the density at @xmath92 . in the following @xmath93 , with @xmath94",
    "are the riesz - transform and @xmath95 is the biot - savart convolution .",
    "recall that for a smooth function @xmath96 these operators admit the kernel representations , @xmath97    [ weaksolution ] let @xmath98 and @xmath99 the density @xmath100)$ ] and the velocity @xmath101)$ ] are a weak solution of the ipm system with initial data @xmath102 and if and only if the weak equation @xmath103 holds for all @xmath104 , and @xmath105    notice that we have interpreted the incompressibility of the velocity field and darcy s law with .",
    "in fact , for @xmath106 the equations @xmath107 together with the condition that @xmath3 vanishes at infinity ( the boundary condition ) are equivalent to @xmath108 thus , they are consistent with definition [ weaksolution ] . definition [ weaksolution ] extends the concept of solution of the system plus vanishing boundary condition for densities which do not necessarily vanish at infinity .",
    "notice that incompressibility and darcy s law are automatically satisfied by our solution in the weak sense .",
    "that is , @xmath109 for all @xmath110 .",

    "the linear constraint is given by    @xmath121    as observed by szkelyhidi the set @xmath53 contains unbounded velocities which is slightly pleasant .",
    "thus for a given @xmath122 we define    @xmath123    subsolutions raised a relaxation of the nonlinear constraint . in the framework of the ipm system",

    "we are using same notation that @xcite in section 4 , but with @xmath129 there replace by @xmath3 here .",

    "as we saw in the previous section we can take the constant @xmath377 in ( the speed of growth of the mixing zone ) between @xmath387 and @xmath388 , but from now on we will take @xmath389 , i.e. @xmath390 , to alleviate the notation ( small changes yields the same result for different a @xmath377 ) .",
    "let us sketch the strategy of the proof :    the mean velocity @xmath391 loses a derivative with respect to the variable @xmath287 . if we want to obtain bounds independent of the smallness of @xmath392 we have to deal with two different problems , a derivative we lose in a transport term and a derivative that we lose in an operator which might resemble the @xmath56 operator as in the muskat case ( with the bad sign ) .",
    "however a more detailed analysis shows that the main term of our velocity can be described in terms of a pseudodifferential operator @xmath393 which will be shown to be comparable with @xmath82 .",
    "let us explain our strategy .",
    "we first consider the equation    @xmath394    where @xmath395 . if we just try to bound the @xmath396norm of the function @xmath96 by using a standard energy estimate we find that @xmath397 since @xmath398    thus this energy estimate fails to bound the @xmath396norm of @xmath96",

    "we add a transport term with constant coefficient and a term of order 0 @xmath401 we will look to the quantity @xmath402    taking a time derivative in the previous functions yields @xmath403 therefore , for a fixed time @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",

    "in fact we can not work directly with the equation but we need to regularize the system by introducing two parameters , @xmath409 and @xmath6 . with the parameter @xmath409 we will regularize the transport term and with the parameter @xmath6 the @xmath56 operator . by using a picard s theorem we will be able to show local existence of solutions in some sobolev s space @xmath410 , but the time of existence of these solutions will depend on @xmath409 and @xmath6 .",
    "then we will perform energy estimates to obtain bounds in @xmath410 independent of @xmath409 and we will pass to the limit in this parameter .",

    "obtaining these estimates is the main part of this section .",
    "the theorem , concerning the existence of local solutions , for the system and , is stated .",
    "the proof will be divided in several steps : 1 ) a more detailed study of the mean velocity @xmath70 , 2 ) a priori energy estimates on the equation , 3 ) we will regularize the system and , using two parameters @xmath6 and @xmath409 , apply a pircard s theorem to obtain existence of solution for the regularized problem and use the a priori energy estimates to pass to the limit .",
    "some of the computations are rather heavy so we prove them in a suitable appendix .",

    "has many steps we subdivided in subsections .",
    "the manipulation of the commutators is rather long and it includes some ideas which might be of independent interest in the study of pseudodifferential operators .",

    "we can parameterize @xmath412 as the graph of a function @xmath413 and we will prove existence of solutions of the equation of the form @xmath414 . by introducing this ansatz in we",
