    "the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap_)@xmath11 mission was designed to make precise , accurate , and reliable measurements of the microwave sky to allow the extraction of cosmological information from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite .",
    "use of the cmb for cosmology is limited , however , by microwave foreground contamination from our milky way galaxy and from extragalactic sources .",
    "the separation of the cmb and foreground signal components fundamentally relies on their differing spectral and spatial distributions . to facilitate the separation of signal components , _ wmap _",
    "was designed to map the full sky at five widely separated frequencies , from 23 ghz to 94 ghz ( see table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "a similar approach was taken by the _",
    "mission @xcite , although with only three frequency bands . while _ cobe _ resulted in a 6144 pixel map , the _ wmap _  map has 3,145,728 sky pixels , with @xmath12 sr per pixel .",
    "the _ wmap _  mission is described by @xcite , the optical design by @xcite , the feed horns by @xcite , and the radiometers and their frequency coverage by @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we follow the notation convention that flux density is @xmath13 and antenna temperature is @xmath14 , where the spectral indices are related by @xmath15 . in general , the cmb is expressed in terms of thermodynamic temperature , while galactic and extragalactic foregrounds are expressed in antenna temperature .",

    "microwave and other measurements show that , at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath28 ) , cmb anisotropy dominates the galactic signals in the frequency range @xmath29 ghz @xcite .",
    "this fact makes the use of the masks discussed in ",
    "[ mask ] attractive .",
    "in  [ mechanisms ] we address physical emission mechanisms that contribute to galactic emission : synchrotron , free - free , thermal dust , and nonthermal ( spinning or thermally fluctuating magnetic ) dust emission . in  [ ilc ]",
    "we demonstrate a method that combines the _ wmap _  maps in such a way as to isolate the cmb . in ",
    "[ fitting ] we separate the signals by emission type to better understand the foregrounds . through a better understanding of the foregrounds we are able to demonstrate the degree of residual contamination for cmb analyses after masks are applied .",
    "we also improve our understanding of the astrophysics of the foreground emission . in  [ templatefits ]",
    "we prepare a set of maps for cosmological analysis : we apply the masks from  [ mask ] to remove the brightest regions of emission , and then remove residual foreground emission using the templates introduced in  [ mechanisms ] . in  [ pointsources ] we estimate the level of extragalactic point source contamination and provide a list of the strongest sources . in  [ sz ]",
    "we assess the degree to which the wmap maps are affected by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "we conclude in  [ conclusions ] by summarizing the major results of the paper .",
    "the purpose of a foreground mask is to exclude map pixels that contain `` too much '' foreground signal from use in cmb analyses .",
    "some pixels often need to be masked even after a foreground reduction technique has been applied to a map .",
    "what constitutes `` too much '' foreground signal depends on the particular analysis .",
    "it is therefore useful to have masks available with different flux cut - off levels . for example , these masks can be used to demonstrate ( in)sensitivity of scientific results to the level of foreground sky cut .",
    "the mask cut - off level is always a compromise between eliminating foregrounds and preserving maximal usable sky area in analyses .",
    "the majority of excluded sky area in any mask is the galactic plane region .",
    "the mask has the same pixel format as the map , where each mask pixel indicates whether or not the corresponding map pixel is to be used in analyses .",
    "a successful mask should exclude those broad sky areas that are dominated by foregrounds , while leaving unexpunged the sky areas dominated by the cmb .",
    "further , a useful recipe should be based on an unbiased process .",
    "_ wmap _  has adopted a small set of standard masks of varying severity but with a common recipe .",
    "all masks are based on the k - band map since the foreground contamination is most severe in this lowest frequency band .",
    "the histogram distribution of all the pixel brightnesses in this map is strongly asymmetric in favor of positive pixel values because of the foreground contamination , as seen in figure [ hist ] .",
    "we reflect the ( relatively uncontaminated ) left side of the observed histogram about the mode .",
    "this symmetrized distribution is subtracted from the observed distribution , leaving a remainder , which is interpreted as contamination .",
    "the remainder histogram defines cutoff brightnesses .",
    "the cutoff is applied to a low - resolution version of the k - band map in order to avoid excluding an archipelago of isolated pixels .",
    "_ wmap _  images are generally pixelized with a healpix @xmath30 parameter of 512 , whereas the masks are generated at @xmath31 .",
    "however , this procedure gives the mask a peculiar boundary inherited from the diamond - shaped pixels .",
    "accordingly , the boundary is softened by filtering the mask , which consists of ones and zeros , with a gaussian of @xmath32 full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) , and taking the 0.5 contour of the result as the new mask boundary .    as explained above",
    ", a range of cutoff levels is desirable .",
    "a convenient step size in cut - off temperature is derived from the sky histogram , shown in figure [ hist ] , by using the root - mean - square ( rms ) half - width of this histogram for values less than the mode .",
    "a series of masks are made using multiples of these step sizes .",
    "a cut at the peak value of the remainder histogram is referred to as `` p0 '' .",
    "the sky cut used in any analysis is described by a symbolic name .",
    "for example , the mask defined by the peak of the remainder histogram using the k - band map is `` kp0 '' .",
    "a mask with a temperature cut - off two steps smaller in temperature ( more severe ) is called `` km2 '' , where `` m '' means `` minus '' and ( for a less severe cut ) `` p '' means `` plus '' .",
    "figure [ maskmap ] shows selected masks based on the definitions in figure [ hist ] . a separate set of masks based on bands other than k - band is not necessary since they correspond closely with specific k - band defined masks .",
    "in addition to diffuse galactic emission , point sources also contaminate the _ wmap _  maps .",
    "we have constructed a point source source mask that includes : ( 1 ) all of the sources from @xcite ( which is the updated @xcite 5 ghz 1 jy compilation with attached optical source identifications ) ; ( 2 ) sources with 22 ghz fluxes @xmath33 jy from the @xcite comprehensive compilation of flat spectrum agn ; ( 3 ) additional flat spectrum objects from @xcite ; and ( 4 ) sources from the x - ray / radio blazar survey of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mask excludes a radius of @xmath34 about each of almost 700 source positions .",

    "we have two objectives .",
    "one is to fit and remove the foregrounds to derive cmb maps with well - specified levels of contamination .",

    "this can be done , for example , when comparing the _ wmap _  free - free measurements in the galactic plane to the @xcite 408 mhz observations .",

    "h@xmath6 is in r - band where the extinction is 0.75 times visible , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 , so @xmath74 .",
    "@xcite assembled a full sky h@xmath6 map using data from several surveys : the wisconsin h - alpha mapper ( wham ) , the virginia tech spectral - line survey ( vtss ) , and the southern h - alpha sky survey atlas ( shassa ) .",
    "this map , with the @xcite ( hereafter referred to as sfd ) extinction map of the sky , are used together to compute a best guess map of free - free emission in regions where @xmath75 , under the assumption of co - extensive dust and ionized gas .",
    "the resulting template is shown in figure [ ion](a ) .",
    "we note that this template only approximates the free - free emission .",
    "there are several sources of uncertainty and error .",
    "for example : ( a ) h@xmath6 light scatters from dust grains in a manner unlike free - free ; ( b ) there is uncertainty in the calibration of the h@xmath6 measurements , both within and between the observational groups ; ( c ) there is some error in separating the geocoronal emission from the h@xmath6 line emission ; ( d ) any inaccuracy in the assumed balmer atomic rates will also introduce error ; ( e ) the h@xmath6 intensity depends on @xmath45 , and it is not known precisely how @xmath45 changes across the galaxy ; ( f ) there is uncertainty in ionization state of helium ; ( g ) any gas that has a sufficient bulk velocity could emit outside the bandwidth of the h@xmath6 observations ; and ( h ) the extinction correction assumes that the h@xmath6 emission is co - extensive with the dust along the line of sight .",
    "it would be difficult to assess and propagate all of the above sources of error .",
    "a comparison with a _ wmap _  free - free map will be discussed in  [ mem ] .",
    "synchrotron emission arises from the acceleration of cosmic ray electrons in magnetic fields .",
    "the acceleration occurs in type ib and type ii supernova remnants .",
    "the same @xmath76 stars that form these remnants also emit uv radiation that heats dust grains and ionizes hydrogen in the interstellar medium .",
    "thus synchrotron emission is associated with the star - formation cycle .",
    "the energy spectrum of cosmic ray electrons is expressed as a relativistic electron number density distribution @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 varies across the galaxy , as does the magnetic field , @xmath79 , the resulting synchrotron emission can be characterized by a wide range of spectral behaviors , and hence _ the observed morphology of synchrotron sky maps will change substantially with frequency_. the synchrotron flux density spectral index , @xmath6 , is related to the electron power law index , @xmath80 , by @xmath81 at frequencies greater than a few ghz , where self - absorption is negligible .",
    "the synchrotron emission spectrum is further affected by cosmic ray propagation , energy loss , and degree of confinement .",
    "cosmic ray electrons can propagate via diffusion and/or convection .",
    "diffusion involves the random scattering of cosmic ray electrons from varying magnetic fields , while convection implies the systematic outward movement of the sources of scattering .",
    "cosmic rays lose energy via synchrotron loss , inverse compton scattering , adiabatic loss , and free - free loss .",
    "cosmic ray electrons may be largely confined to their host galaxies , or may freely leave their halos .",
    "highly confined cosmic ray electrons lose their energy before they escape from the halo of the galaxy , while poorly confined electrons escape the galaxy before they lose a substantial portion of their energy . a steep spectral index ( e.g. , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) indicates a high rate of energy loss and a low escape rate .",
    "a flatter spectral index ( e.g. , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) indicates that electrons can escape their host galaxy before losing a significant fraction of their energy .",
    "this can imply strong convection .",
    "synchrotron emission can be categorized as arising from two types of sources : electrons trapped in the magnetic fields of discrete supernova remnants and diffuse emission from cosmic ray electrons spread throughout the galaxy . in a discrete supernova",
    "the magnetic field ( typically @xmath86 g ) is enhanced because it is frozen into the shocked compressed gas .",
    "the diffuse magnetic field in the galaxy is typically only @xmath87 g .    discrete supernova remnants typically have a spectral index of @xmath88 ( i.e. @xmath89 ) in the few ghz radio range @xcite ( see also http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/snrs.info.html ) and contribute only @xmath90 of the total synchrotron emission of the galaxy at 1.5 ghz @xcite , despite the enhanced magnetic field strength . more than 90% of the observed synchrotron emission arises from a diffuse component with a direction - dependent spectral index that generally lies in the range @xmath91 ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "the cosmic ray electrons in the galaxy substantially outlive their original supernova remnants and slowly lose energy while traveling large distances across the galaxy .",
    "the nonthermal spectral index is seen to steepen off the disk in our galaxy and the same effect is seen in external galaxies .",
    "the observed steepening implies that energy loss is important @xcite .",
    "the low - frequency cut - off of synchrotron emission arises both from the single - electron synchrotron spectrum ( @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the modified bessel function ) low - frequency cut - off , and from self - absorption and free - free absorption , both of which become increasingly efficient at lower frequencies .",
    "the rise in the low - frequency synchrotron spectrum in the optically thick regime goes as @xmath96 .",
    "synchrotron emission is also cut - off by the razin - tsytovich effect , which describes a strong suppression of the synchrotron radiation when the phase velocity of the light in the plasma is greater than @xmath97 .",
    "the synchrotron cut - off occurs at frequencies below where the kinetic temperature is equal to the brightness temperature .",
    "this often occurs at a frequencies of a few mhz , but can also play a role in ghz - peaked sources .",
    "synchrotron emission can be highly polarized , with the degree of linear polarization as high as @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 polarized .",
    "this is almost never observed , however , due to faraday rotation ( @xmath100 ) and non - uniform magnetic field directions along a line of sight , which generally reduce the degree of observed polarization to @xmath101 .",
    "figure [ haslamk](a ) shows the radio emission mapped over the full sky with moderate sensitivity at 408 mhz by @xcite .",
    "this map is dominated by synchrotron emission .",
    "low frequency ( @xmath102 ghz ) spectral studies of the synchrotron emission indicate that @xmath103 , although substantial variations from this mean occur across the sky @xcite .",
    "higher energy cosmic ray electrons lose their energy faster than lower energy electrons , so the synchrotron spectral index steepens with time .",
    "sometimes a `` break '' is seen in synchrotron spectra , which is useful for determining the age of the source . at frequencies above the break the spectral index steepens to @xmath104 due to synchrotron losses .",
    "this corresponds to an antenna temperature steepening of @xmath105 .",
    "@xcite predicts a break in the synchrotron spectrum of the milky way at 22 ghz , arising from a break in the relativistic electron spectrum at 20 gev .",
    "synchrotron steepening breaks with @xmath106 have been observed in a few discrete sources @xcite , indicating additional processes beyond synchrotron losses .",
    "physical steepening effects compete against an observational measurement bias towards flat spectrum components .",
    "steep spectral index synchrotron components seen at low radio frequencies become weak relative to flat spectral index components when observed at higher microwave frequencies .",
    "thus it should be expected that flatter spectrum components will increasingly dominate in observations at higher microwave frequencies , even as all components may steepen .",
    "the study of external galaxies can inform our picture of the milky way .",
    "for example , @xcite present maps of the 610 mhz and 1.49 ghz emission from the edge - on spiral galaxy ngc891 .",
    "they find that the synchrotron spectral index varies from @xmath107 in most of the galactic plane to @xmath108 in the halo .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to expect similar spectral index variations in the milky way at @xmath109 ghz .",
    "as one maps any such galaxy at increasingly higher frequencies the overall appearance will change considerably , with the flatter @xmath107 plane emission increasingly dominating over the steeper spectral index halo .    in summary , _",
    "the synchrotron signal is complex .",
    "a large range of spectral indices are both expected and observed .",
    "thus , any synchrotron template map of the sky will be frequency - dependent_. for many years cmb researchers have evaluated the synchrotron contamination level of their cmb data by examination of the haslam - correlated amplitude scaled by @xmath110 . given the expected and observed spectral index variability , this",
    "not necessarily sound .",
    "thermal dust emission has been mapped over the full sky in several infrared bands , most notably by the _",
    "cobe _ and _ iras _ missions .",
    "a full sky template is provided by @xcite ( sfd ) , and is extrapolated in frequency by @xcite , hereafter referred to as fds .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fds](a ) .",
    "measurements of the thermal dust spectral index generally lie in the range @xmath111 . for _ wmap",
    "_  wavelengths , the fds extrapolation predicts @xmath112 .",
    "@xcite showed that there is an inverse relationship between the dust temperature and its spectral index .",
    "more recently , @xcite have observed this inverse relation , in detail , in sources observed with the pronaos ( programme national dobservations submillimetriques ) 2-m balloon telescope at effective wavelengths of 200 , 260 , 360 and 580 @xmath24 m . for dust temperatures below 20 k ,",
    "@xcite observe values in the range @xmath113 in m17 .",
    "these steep values have implications for the grain material .",
    "they suggest emission from silicate grains such as mgo@xmath114sio@xmath115 with @xmath116 at @xmath117 k @xcite or natural olivines such as fayalite ( mg@xmath118fe@xmath119sio@xmath120 with @xmath121 ) @xcite .    a remarkably tight correlation exists between the far - infrared and synchrotron emission of galaxies .",
    "this relation has been extensively studied and modeled @xcite .",
    "@xcite comment that the synchrotron emission appears spatially smeared relative to the far - infrared distribution in galaxies .",
    "they suggest that this likely arises from the diffusion and/or convection of the cosmic ray electrons from their original site of star formation activity .",
    "if this is true , then one would expect higher frequency radio observations to become increasingly tightly correlated with the far - infrared distribution since the higher microwave frequencies preferentially sample the flatter spectrum , younger component .",
    "commenting on the synchrotron - dust correlation , @xcite predicts that , `` ... whether integral or local , the correlation should also become better for smaller wavelengths of observation .",
    "the reason is that a decreasing wavelength implies higher energies of the radiating electrons .",
    "these electrons lose energy faster and therefore are more localized around their sources . ''",
    "in addition to the thermal emission from dust , above , there are various other ways in which dust can radiate at microwave wavelengths .",
    "these include electric dipole emission from spinning dust grains and magnetic dipole emission from thermally fluctuating dust grains @xcite .",
    "emission from spinning dust can produce @xmath122 from 20 - 40 ghz .",
    "the high - frequency cut - off of spinning dust emission is due to the limited speed at which a dust grain can spin .",
    "all theories to explain the amazingly tight correlation between radio and far - infrared emission from galaxy to galaxy relate to the level of the star formation activity .",
    "the star formation cycle forms and destroys dust grains , heats the grains , creates magnetic fields and relativistic electrons , and creates the o- and b - stars that ionize the gas .",
    "the tight correlation persists down to very low radio frequencies , yet the radio emission can not be due to spinning dust gains since they do not radiate strongly at such long wavelengths .",
    "this suggests that radio / microwave emission and thermal dust emission are tightly correlated , not because of a common dust emission source , but rather as a result of the fact that both trace star - formation activity .",
    "while spinning dust emission is not a dominant source of @xmath123 ghz radio emission in the galaxy , it may be significant at higher microwave frequencies ( @xmath124 ghz ) .",
    "@xcite searched for spinning dust emission in ten discrete galactic sources at 5 , 8 , and 10 ghz .",
    "no detection was reported for 8 of the 10 sources , implying that spinning dust emission is not a ubiquitous and dominant emission mechanism in our galaxy .",
    "two of the ten sources were reported `` tentative '' detections .",
    "they caution that a solid detection would require observations of the predicted spectral roll off both at high and low frequencies .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the milky way should be like other spiral galaxies and , in particular , the microwave properties of external galaxies should help elucidate the global properties of the milky way . @xcite",
    "report the spectra of 16 spiral galaxies to frequencies up to 10.7 ghz .",
    "they find that the spectral index , averaged over the 16 galaxies , is well described by a single synchrotron power law spectral index of @xmath125 .",
    "@xcite report that the mean spectrum of 56 bright spiral galaxies is dominated by synchrotron emission , with a small additional free - free emission component .",
    "they report that a free - free plus single power - law synchrotron fit fully explains their observations . @xcite",
    "examine 74 shapley - ames galaxies and they also find their spectra dominated by a power - law synchrotron index with some free - free emission .",
    "these extragalactic studies report no suggestion of anomalous sources of emission .",
    "the main impediment to stronger statements about spinning dust emission in external galaxies is the ( perhaps surprising ) sparsity of microwave observations of normal galaxies at microwave frequencies greater than @xmath126 ghz .",
    "linear combinations of the multi - frequency _ wmap _  sky maps can be formed using constraints so that the response to galactic signals is approximately canceled while maintaining unit response to the cmb .",
    "linear combinations of multi - frequency data need not rely on assumptions about the foreground signal strengths of the various emission mechanisms .",
    "an advantage of this method is that it is `` internal '' , that is , it relies only on _ wmap _  data , so the calibration and systematic errors of other experiments do not enter .",
    "we create a cmb map by computing a weighted combination of the maps that have been band - averaged within each of the five _ wmap _  frequency bands , all smoothed to @xmath127 resolution .",
    "weights can be determined by minimizing the variance of the measured temperatures subject to the constraint that the weights add to one , thus preserving unit response to the thermal cmb spectrum .    when the entire sky is treated with a single set of weights ,",
    "imperfections are apparent due to the fact that the foreground properties ( i.e. , spectral indices ) have significant spatial variation , especially within the inner galactic plane .",
    "thus , to improve the result , the inner galactic plane is divided into 11 separate regions , within which weights are determined independently .",
    "all but one of the @xmath128 total regions are thus in the inner galactic plane , within the kp2 cut .",
    "the temperature ( in cmb thermodynamic units ) of each pixel , @xmath129 , in each region @xmath130 is @xmath131    where the sum is over the five _ wmap _  bands .",
    "the weights , @xmath132 , for each region are determined by carrying out a nonlinear search for the minimum of @xmath133 within each of the @xmath134 regions of the sky , subject to the constraint that @xmath135 thus preserving only signals with a cmb spectrum . for the region that covers the full sky outside of the inner galactic plane ,",
    "the weights are @xmath136 for k , ka , q , v , and w bands , respectively .",
    "this process creates a map with slight discontinuities at the region boundaries since each region , @xmath137 , is treated independently . to smooth these discontinuities , we create a set of @xmath134 maps , with weights @xmath138 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 for all other @xmath129 .",
    "we then smooth these @xmath128 maps of @xmath141 ( containing only ones and zeros ) using a @xmath142 smoothing kernel .",
    "the final map is then given by the weighted combination @xmath143 which greatly reduces boundary effects .",
    "the resulting cmb map is shown in figure [ bs](a ) .",
    "in  [ ilc ] the objective was to cancel the galactic signal , regardless of its nature . in this section",
    "we attempt to distinguish and understand the different emission sources .",
    "it is a coincidence of nature that there are three known emission mechanisms that are each capable of generating similar spectra in the microwave spectral regime .",
    "free - free , synchrotron , and spinning dust emission can all have a spectral index of @xmath144 at the _ wmap _  frequencies .",
    "the key to separating these is to use data from outside the microwave spectral regime .",
    "recent observations of h@xmath6 emission over large regions of the sky can help trace free - free emission .",
    "this is especially useful in regions where the extinction of h@xmath6 is small , largely at high galactic latitudes .",
    "the 408 mhz radio map @xcite is at a sufficiently low frequency that spinning dust emission is negligible .",
    "we formulate a model temperature solution at each frequency band and each pixel , @xmath129 , as @xmath145    where @xmath146 and @xmath147 represent the cmb , synchrotron ( plus spinning dust ) , free - free , and thermal dust components , respectively .",

    "to stabilize the mem computations at frequencies where individual components are weak , and thus poorly determined , we extend the synchrotron power law spectral index between q - band and v - band to w - band .",
    "likewise , we extend the dust index between w- and v - bands to q- , ka- , and k - bands .",
    "the extension is re - applied at every iterative step .",

    "after some trial - and - error , we arrive at a map of @xmath177 values that implement this , @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the k - band antenna temperature in mk .",

    "figure [ memsync ] shows that there is a fairly close spatial correlation between synchrotron and thermal dust emission at microwave wavelengths .",
    "figure [ synchist ] is a histogram of the synchrotron and/or spinning dust component .",
    "the spectral index looks very much like synchrotron emission with a 0.5 steepening of the index from synchrotron losses , as predicted by @xcite based on the observed break in the relativistic electron spectrum in the solar neighborhood .    to limit the fraction of the low frequency non - thermal component that can be attributed to spinning dust",
    ", we construct a spinning dust emission model whose spectrum is characterized by the cold neutral medium spectrum of @xcite , and whose spatial distribution is that of the mem - derived thermal dust emission .",
    "the overall normalization of the model is a free parameter .",
    "for a given normalization factor , we subtract this map from the non - thermal component model maps at each of the five wmap bands and at the haslam frequency ; the remainder is assumed to be a series of synchrotron maps .",

    "the result is that the spinning dust fraction is less than about 5% of the total ka - band emission .",
    "we conclude that any spinning dust emission component is subdominant .",
    "the thermal dust spectral index histogram , shown in figure [ dusthist ] , indicates @xmath189 .    the mem method is a bayesian approach to model fitting that incorporates prior knowledge of the galactic model .",
    "the results are driven by a combination of the data and the priors .",
    "the cmb internal linear combination map is based on 5 numbers over the majority of the sky , therefore subtracting it from each band removes only a small fraction of a degree of freedom per pixel .",
    "then we fit 7 parameters for free - free , synchrotron ( + spinning dust ) , and thermal dust : 3 amplitudes , and 4 spectral indices ( 0 free - free , 3 synchrotron , 1 thermal dust ) .",
    "we fit these 7 parameters with 5 bands of data plus 3 amplitude priors ( which incorporate positivity on each amplitude ) , for a total of 7 parameters with 8 independent constraints per pixel .",
    "the degree to which the prior information constrains the model is set by the regularizing parameter @xmath151 , thus one can not count the number of degrees of freedom as in a pure @xmath190 fit .",
    "a demonstration that there is sufficient power in the data to guide the fit is that the result is relatively insensitive to variations in the priors or the gain and that the results are physically reasonable .",
    "we freeze the spectral models @xmath170 , @xmath191 , and @xmath171 once small residuals are achieved , and the improvement in the residuals is not significant .",
    "we then introduce the cmb as a model component with a known spectral index , @xmath192 for a planck function @xmath156 with @xmath21 k , and iterate again to solve for a cmb map and modified component amplitude maps .",
    "the mem - derived cmb map is shown in figure [ memcmb]b and a binned pixel - by - pixel comparison with the internal combination cmb map is shown in figure [ ttmemcmb]c .",
    "it is not surprising that the mem cmb map agrees well with the linear combination map since the foreground components were derived based on low residuals with respect to the subtracted linear combination cmb map . yet , by giving the component amplitudes an opportunity to re - adjust with the cmb amplitudes as a new degree of freedom , it is a reassuring cross - check that the solutions are generally unaffected .",
    "small ( @xmath109% ) errors seen in the galactic plane of the mem cmb map relative to the combination cmb map illustrate the residual uncertainty of the mem solution .",
    "low residual solutions are highly constrained , but not necessarily unique or correct .",
    "loosely speaking , the model must account for a considerable signal amplitude in k - band and very little total amplitude in v - band .",
    "this constrains the synchrotron spectral index to be steep .",
    "likewise , the model must match the dust signal in w - band , but the dust spectral index must be steep enough to stay under the total signal level in v - band",
    ". the free - free level can be thought of as making up the remainder of the v - band signal after the synchrotron and dust have been fit .",
    "any additional emission components are strongly disfavored due to the already low total v - band signal .",
    "limitations in the precision and accuracy of the h@xmath6 measurements , uncertainty in the degree of h@xmath6 extinction , and the uncertainty in the conversion factor between h@xmath6 and free - free , combine so as to not allow the free - free to be fixed with sufficient precision to achieve a uniquely `` correct '' mem solution .",
    "figure [ ttmemff]c shows a ( bin - averaged ) pixel - by - pixel comparison of the mem free - free result with the h@xmath6 prior .",
    "the slope is within @xmath193% ( depending on the method of fit ) of the expected value from  [ ff ] and table [ tbl-1 ] , meaning that the model can not be far off what is physically reasonable",
    ".    the total observed galactic emission matches the mem model to @xmath187% while emission is separated into the individual components with a few percent accuracy .",
    "an overview of the galactic spectra and spatial power is shown in figure [ overview ] .",
    "the total flux of our galaxy ( @xmath194 ) in the five _ wmap _  bands is 45 , 38 , 35 , 32 , and 48 kjy , from k - band to w - band .",
    "thus , we present a `` reasonable '' model that conveys far more information about the microwave foregrounds than was previously known .",
    "while the mem method , discussed above in  [ mem ] , produces a cmb map , it is not straightforward to use that map for cosmological analyses since its noise properties are complicated .",

    "we are only concerned with reducing the foreground level .    to further investigate past results on dust - correlated radio emission we fit the fds thermal dust template to the total mem galactic model ( synchrotron plus free - free plus thermal dust emission ) for each _ wmap _  band , using the kp2 cut .",

    "this combined index gets much steeper at lower frequencies ( where the dust emission is weak ) and is much flatter at higher frequencies where the synchrotron and free - free become weak relative to thermal dust emission .",

    "the units of the coefficients are the same as in table [ tbl - templates ] , with the free - free and synchrotron amplitudes referred to q - band .",
    "although this template method is not particularly physical , it does remove the galactic foreground outside the kp2 cut sufficiently for cmb analyses , as shown in figure [ templatein ] .",
    "we estimate the residual contamination in two ways . by examining deviations from a gaussian distribution",
    ", we estimate that the template subtraction reduces the galactic signal rms ( after the sky cut ) by 86% in q - band , 81% in v - band , and 84% in w - band .",
    "this agrees well with a power spectrum estimate in the range @xmath207 before and after the template subtraction .",
    "we estimate that the galactic contamination has gone from 32% of the cmb power to 2.2% of the power in q - band , from 7.2% to 0.8% in v - band , and from 11% to @xmath208% in w - band .",
    "see @xcite for the power spectra before and after the template subtraction .",
    "this method was adopted before the mem solutions were available to allow the cmb work to proceed in parallel with the galaxy work and thus to enable a timely release of data products to the scientific community .",
    "future analyses will likely use a modified approach , but _ we caution that the mem results can not be applied directly to cmb analyses because of their complicated noise and signal correlations . _    we conclude that _ template fits are a valuable method for reducing foreground contamination from cmb maps , but are a poor way to distinguish individual physical emission components due to their correlated morphological structures . _",
    "in addition to the galactic foregrounds , extragalactic point sources will contaminate the _ wmap _  anisotropy data .",
    "estimates of the level of point source contamination expected at the _ wmap _  frequencies have been made based on extrapolations from measured counts at higher and lower frequencies @xcite .",
    "direct 15 ghz source count measurements by @xcite indicate that these extrapolated source counts underestimate the true counts by a factor of two .",

    "<S> the _ wmap _  mission has mapped the full sky to determine the geometry , content , and evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> full sky maps are made in five microwave frequency bands to separate the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) from foreground emission , including diffuse galactic emission and galactic and extragalactic point sources . </S>",
    "<S> we define masks that excise regions of high foreground emission , so cmb analyses can be carried out with minimal foreground contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we also present maps and spectra of the individual emission components , leading to an improved understanding of galactic astrophysical processes . </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of template fits to remove foreground emission from the _ wmap _  data is also examined . </S>",
    "<S> these efforts result in a cmb map with minimal contamination and a demonstration that the _ wmap _  cmb power spectrum is insensitive to residual foreground emission .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a maximum entropy method to construct a model of the galactic emission components . </S>",
    "<S> the observed total galactic emission matches the model to @xmath0 and the individual model components are accurate to a few percent . we find that the milky way resembles other normal spiral galaxies between 408 mhz and 23 ghz , with a synchrotron spectral index that is flattest ( @xmath1 ) near star - forming regions , especially in the plane , and steepest ( @xmath2 in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with a picture of relativistic cosmic ray electron generation in star - forming regions and diffusion and convection within the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the significant synchrotron index steepening out of the plane suggests a diffusion process in which the halo electrons are trapped in the galactic potential long enough to suffer synchrotron and inverse compton energy losses and hence a spectral steepening . the synchrotron index is steeper in the _ wmap _  bands than in lower frequency radio surveys , with a spectral break near 20 ghz to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the modeled thermal dust spectral index is also steep in the _ wmap _  bands , with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our model is driven to these conclusions by the low level of total foreground contamination at @xmath5 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> microwave and h@xmath6 measurements of the ionized gas agree well with one another at about the expected levels . </S>",
    "<S> spinning dust emission is limited to @xmath75% of the ka - band foreground emission , assuming a thermal dust distribution with a cold neutral medium spectrum and a monotonically decreasing synchrotron spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> a catalog of 208 point sources is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of the catalog is 98% , i.e. , we expect five of the 208 sources to be statistically spurious . </S>",
    "<S> the mean spectral index of the point sources is @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> derived source counts suggest a contribution to the anisotropy power from unresolved sources of @xmath10sr at q - band and negligible levels at v - band and w - band . </S>",
    "<S> the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is shown to be a negligible `` contamination '' to the maps . </S>"
