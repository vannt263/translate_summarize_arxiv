    "research of hadrons with charm and bottom flavors is one of the most interesting subjects in the present hadron and nuclear physics . as motivated by discoveries of new exotic hadrons with charm and bottom ( x , y , z etc . ) in experiments , new types of hadrons , such as multi - quark or hadronic molecules , are investigated by many researchers @xcite . among them , hadrons including @xmath0 or @xmath2 meson are interesting objects not only in vacuum but also in nuclear medium .",
    "because a @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) meson is composed with anti - charm quark @xmath6 ( anti - bottom quark @xmath7 ) and a light quark @xmath8 , there is no annihilation process of quark and antiquark pair in nuclear medium .",
    "the decay modes are only electromagnetic or weak processes .",
    "therefore , we expect to obtain precise information about the dynamics of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) meson in nuclear matter , such as their energy levels in atomic nuclei , without being disturbed by the strong decay processes and absorption processes @xcite",
    ". this nice property of @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons may be in contrast with their antiparticle states , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons . because @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons in nuclear medium include light quark annihilation processes , the nonnegligible widths by the decays and absorptions make it difficult to study the dynamics of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons in nuclear medium .",
    "study of @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons in nuclear matter will provide us with important information about ( i ) hadron - nucleon interaction , ( ii ) modification of hadrons in nuclear matter , and ( iii ) changes of nuclear medium caused by hadron as impurity . as known in the light flavor mesons in nuclear medium ,",
    "the mass shifts of vector mesons @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 give information of partial restoration of chiral symmetry breaking in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "it is also the case for @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons , because each of them contains a single light quark .",
    "the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons are also concerned with the modifications of quarkonia in nuclear medium @xcite . in early works @xcite ,",
    "it was discussed that @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons are bound in atomic nuclei , such as @xmath14 .",
    "the properties of @xmath0 mesons have been studied by several researchers with various theoretical approaches , such as qcd sum rule @xcite , hadronic dynamics @xcite and so on . in the literature ,",
    "the binding energy of a @xmath0 meson in normal nuclear matter is estimated to be around a few ten mev . in the present paper",
    ", we discuss the hadron dynamics by focusing on two important symmetries for heavy - light mesons ; the heavy quark symmetry for a heavy quark and chiral symmetry for a light quark .    for the heavy quark symmetry , as a general property of qcd , the magnetic gluon couples to the heavy quark with a suppression factor @xmath15 with the heavy quark mass @xmath16 .",
    "it means that the spin of the heavy quark changes with a suppression by order of @xmath15 , and hence it leads to the approximate mass degeneracy of pseudoscalar meson and vector meson in hadron mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is around 140 mev .",
    "the mass splitting between @xmath2 and @xmath10 meson is around 45 mev , hence the heavy quark symmetry becomes better for bottom flavor .",
    "indeed , these mass splittings are smaller than those in light flavor mesons ; about 400 mev between @xmath17 and @xmath18 mesons , and 630 mev between @xmath19 and @xmath12 mesons . therefore , due to the mass degeneracy in heavy - light mesons",
    ", we need to take int account both pseudoscalar mesons and vector mesons simultaneously as effective degrees of freedom .",
    "the importance of the approximate degeneracy of @xmath0 and @xmath20 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) mesons was already emphasized in studies of several exotic charm and bottom hadrons , such as two - body @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) systems @xcite , @xmath23 mesons @xcite , @xmath24 states @xcite can be compact multi - quark states rather than extended hadronic molecular states .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite and the references therein . ] and so on .",
    "it will be shown in the text that the approximate mass degeneracy is important also for the dynamics of @xmath0 and @xmath20 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) mesons in nuclear medium .",
    "another important symmetry is chiral symmetry .",
    "the pion dynamics induced from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum provides us with a key to understand the low energy hadron and nuclear physics @xcite . in recent studies",
    ", it is discussed that the nuclear systems are almost governed by the pion dynamics following to the strong tensor force .",
    "for example , the binding energies of nuclei are given about 80 % by the pion exchange as shown in the few - body calculations @xcite .",
    "the nuclear matter with infinite volume can also be described almost by the pion exchange between nucleons @xcite .",
    "not only the normal nuclei , but also neutron - rich nuclei @xcite and hypernuclei with strangeness @xcite , are important objects in which the pion dynamics plays a dominant role .",
    "the importance of the pion exchange was also emphasized for exotic charm and bottom hadrons in refs .",
    "@xcite as above mentioned .",
    "especially , the various bound or resonant states of the two - body @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) systems can be formed by the strong tensor force induced from the pion exchange between @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is quite essential to consider the pion dynamics in order to discuss the properties of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) mesons in nuclear medium .    in the present work , with respecting the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry , we focus on the pion dynamics for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) mesons in nuclear medium",

    "we find that @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons have negative mass shifts at the normal nuclear matter density , and hence they can be bound in nuclear matter . in sec .  3",
    ", we apply the results in the uniform nuclear matter to the study of the energy levels of @xmath0 meson in atomic nuclei .",
    "we consider @xmath4 and @xmath5 nuclei , in which a @xmath0 meson is embedded in @xmath30 and @xmath14 nuclei .",
    "we also discuss isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and find the upper and lower components of the isospin doublet of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) meson behave differently .",
    "we discuss the possible phenomena about the distribution of isospin density around @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) meson in nuclear medium . in sec .  4 , we summarize our discussion and give some perspectives .",

    "we obtain the self - energies @xmath104 mev for @xmath0 meson and @xmath105 mev for @xmath2 meson in isospin symmetric nuclear medium at the normal nuclear matter density @xmath176 @xmath101 . thus",
    ", both @xmath0 and @xmath2 mesons can be bound in nuclear matter . as an application to atomic nuclei",

    "it will be also necessary to consider the modification of the qcd vacuum at finite density . in experiments the nuclei with @xmath0 or @xmath2 meson may be produced in collisions of hadron ( antiproton , @xmath19 ) to nucleus @xcite , in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xcite and in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
