    "the strong coupling constant and quark masses constitute the fundamental parameters of the standard model .",
    "it is an important task of lattice qcd to determine these parameters using inputs at low energy scales such as hadron masses , meson decay constants and quark potential quantities .",
    "the results can be compared with independent determinations from high energy experiments , which should provide a firm evidence of the single scale nature of qcd .",
    "in the course of evaluating these fundamental parameters we need the process of renormalization in some scheme .",
    "the @xmath1 scheme is one of the most popular schemes , and hence one would like to evaluate the running coupling constant through input of low energy quantities on the lattice and convert it to the @xmath1 scheme .",
    "a difficulty in this process is that the conversion is given only in a perturbative expansion , and should be performed at high energy scales much larger than the qcd scale . at the same time",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath6 should be kept much less than the lattice spacing to reduce lattice artifacts , namely we require @xmath7 a practical difficulty of satisfying these inequalities in numerical simulations is called the window problem .",
    "one of the widely used definitions of the renormalized coupling on the lattice is to employ quantities related to the heavy quark potential @xcite , which are easy to measure accurately .",
    "choosing small size wilson loops , the running coupling constant is extracted from their perturbative expansion with the renormalization scale set to @xmath8 .",
    "this conflicts with the window , and as a consequence lattice artifacts are intrinsically included in the perturbative expansion coefficient in terms of the @xmath9 coupling .",
    "the coefficients tend to explode , which is partly cured by the tadpole improvement @xcite and by combining with @xmath10 improved actions like the staggered fermion action .",
    "this definition of the coupling constant has been employed for @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath0 @xcite flavor cases ( for a review see ref .",
    "recently developed methods using moments of charm quark current - current correlator @xcite or vacuum polarization function @xcite are also not free from the window problem when applying the perturbative expansion while reducing the lattice artifact .    the schrdinger functional ( sf ) scheme @xcite is designed to resolve the window problem .",
    "it has an advantage that systematic errors can be unambiguously controlled .",
    "a unique renormalization scale is introduced through the box size @xmath13",
    ". a wide range of renormalization scales can be covered by the step scaling function ( ssf ) technique , which exempts us of the requirement to satisfy the condition ( [ eqn : window ] ) in a single simulation .",
    "this matches our goal to obtain the coupling constant in the @xmath9 scheme and make comparisons with high energy inputs .",
    "the sf scheme has been applied for evaluation of the qcd coupling for @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite .    in the sf scheme",
    "we start with the evaluation of the running coupling constant for a variety of the bare coupling constant @xmath2 and box sizes , which covers the strong coupling region corresponding to the energy scale @xmath14 mev and the weak coupling region around @xmath15 gev . at low energy scales",
    "we expect the strange quark contribution to be important in addition to those of the up and down quarks .",
    "thus the aim of the present paper is to go one step further than those of refs .",
    "@xcite and evaluate the strong coupling constant in @xmath0 qcd . for setting the physical scale",
    "we employ a recent large - scale @xmath0 lattice qcd simulation employing non - perturbatively o(a ) improved wilson quark action ; the work of cp - pacs / jl - qcd collaboration with relatively heavy pion mass with @xmath3  mev @xcite .",
    "the schrdinger functional is defined on a finite box of size @xmath16 with the dirichlet boundary condition at the temporal boundary .",
    "for qcd the dirichlet boundary condition is set for the spatial component of the gauge link @xmath17 and for the quark fields @xmath18 under a mild assumption it is proven that the tree level gauge effective action has a global minimum around a background field @xcite @xmath19 which is uniquely given by the boundary fields ( [ eqn : boundary ] ) . the fermionic mode is shown to have a mass gap @xcite , so that we are able to define a mass independent scheme directly in the chiral limit .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the same set up ( scheme ) as the alpha collaboration @xcite for the boundary link ( [ eqn : boundary ] ) @xmath20 the parameter @xmath21 is used to define the renormalized coupling constant from the derivative of the effective action and is set to zero in the action after taking derivative with respect to it .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 may be used to define another renormalized quantity , but we set it to zero when evaluating the coupling constant .",

    "we take sufficient number of values for the coupling @xmath57 to cover low to high energy scales .",
    "taking the continuum limit at each scale @xmath57 @xmath58 and performing a polynomial fit we obtain a non - perturbative running of the coupling constant in the sf scheme for the scale change of 2 . 2 .   in the second step",
    "we define a reference scale @xmath59 through a fixed value of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath60 . the value of @xmath60 is arbitrary as long as it is well in low energy region to suppress lattice artifacts with @xmath61 .",
    "we then start from @xmath59 and follow the non - perturbative rg flow in the sf scheme into the high energy region .",
    "a typical scale turns out to be @xmath62 gev in this paper so that after @xmath63 iterations the scale @xmath64 gev is already in the perturbative region where the difference between perturbative and non - perturbative rg runnings is negligible .",
