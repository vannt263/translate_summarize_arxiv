    "pulsating stars in clusters are important targets for investigating stellar internal structure and evolution ( so - called asteroseismology ) because physical parameters such as age and absolute magnitude which impose constraints on the stellar pulsation model can be determined independently from the properties of the clusters ( see a recent excellent review by * ? ? ?",
    "one can get high - precision photometric results for open clusters because stars in open clusters are less crowded than those in globular clusters .",

    "most of them have amplitudes less than 0.1 mag @xcite .",
    "many @xmath1 scuti  type stars are discovered in intermediate - age open clusters because the main - sequence turn - off point of the clusters overlaps the @xmath1 scuti instability strip .",

    "therefore , eclipsing binaries in open clusters can be used as distance indicator and to check stellar evolution theory @xcite .",

    "pulsating periods of the four variables hv1 , hv2 , hv3 , and hv6 are coincident with those of hsb .",
    "but our periods for hv4 and hv5 are different from hsb s results , probably due to the low amplitudes and multiple periodicities ; our data show a weak signal near 24 c / d for hv5 which corresponds to the period of 0.04154 days by hsb .",
    "low frequencies less than 5 c / d with low amplitudes about 5@xmath48 mmag ( @xmath19 for hv4 and @xmath18 for hv5 ) may be originated from the slow variations of our observation system and/or atmospheric conditions .",
    "hsb has classified hv7 ( their i d 220 ) as an irregular variable to have both long and short timescale light variations . as shown in figure 3",
    ", we confirmed the long timescale variations of about 0.633 days but failed to detect the very short timescale variations of about 10 minutes . comparing with the other variables with similar brightness such as hv8 , phase diagram of hv7 shows rather large scatter over the whole phase , implying existence of multiple frequencies .",
    "hsb also noted that hv7 showed different light variations from night to night .",
    "on the basis of the variable period , multiple periodicities , light curve shape , and the position on a color - magnitude diagram located within the @xmath1 scuti instability strip ( see figure 9 ) , we suggest that hv7 is a @xmath2 doradus  type pulsating star . in order to make a confirmation of the @xmath2 doradus  type pulsation and rule out the possibility of the binary or rotation effect , high - resolution time - series spectroscopic observations of hv7 would be required .",
    "we confirmed all the 17 w uma  type binary stars detected by hsb .",
    "orbital periods obtained in our study are in good agreement with hsb s results , except for hv21 .",
    "period difference of hv21 may be resulted from the well - known 1.0 c / d alias effect for the data obtained at single observatory .",
    "in addition to these binaries , our data showed very clearly that hv9 ( their i d 708 ) is a w uma  type binary .",
    "hsb could not classify the variable type of hv9 because it was near the edge of ccd frame and then they had obtained data on only two nights .",

    "hsb identified 14 detached eclipsing binary stars . among these binaries , they detected multiple eclipses for six systems ( hv26 , hv27 , hv28 , hv29 , hv31 , and hv32 ) and then could determine their orbital periods .",

    "in the case of hv29 , hsb determined the orbital period of 5.62050 days .",
    "however , based on our complete light curve , we obtained a half orbital period ( 2.8060 days ) for this system .",
    "hsb detected only one or two eclipses for remaining eight systems ( hv30 , hv33 , hv34 , hv35 , hv36 , hv37 , hv38 , and hv39 ) and so could not determine their orbital periods . among these eight systems",

    "only one or two eclipsing features were detected in our data .",
    "we tried to determine their orbital periods combining with hsb s epochs and ours , but failed due to large separation of epochs . for two systems of hv36 and hv39",

    "we discovered six new pulsating variable stars in our observing field .",
    "on the basis of pulsating periods and positions on the color - magnitude diagram of the cluster , we classified five @xmath1 scuti  type stars ( kv1@xmath4kv5 ) and one @xmath2 doradus  type star ( kv6 ) .",

    "we detected two frequencies for kv3 and only one frequency for kv4 .",
    "kv6 has a long period of 0.9079 days which is comparable with that of @xmath2 doradus  type pulsating stars @xcite .",
    "on the color - magnitude diagram ( figure 9 ) , it is located outside the red edge of @xmath1 scuti - instability strip and near the red edge of @xmath2 doradus - instability strip @xcite . therefore , we suggest that kv6 is a @xmath2 doradus  type pulsating star . the phase diagram of kv6 displays in the right panel of figure 3 .",
    "we discovered new 22 w uma  type binary stars ( kv7@xmath4kv28 ) .",
    "we obtained complete phase coverage for these binary systems , except for kv21 which shows incomplete secondary minimum due to its orbital period of about 0.5 days .",
    "figure 5 shows various shapes of the light curves of these systems with different amplitudes .",

    "all of the 13 pulsating stars , except for two fainter ones kv5 and hv6 , are located inside or near the @xmath1 scuti instability strip , suggesting that they may be probable member stars in the cluster .",

    ", @xcite found a zero membership probability for two @xmath1 scuti  type stars ( hv1 and kv2 ) and a @xmath2 doradus  type star ( hv7 ) . in the case of two faint variables kv5 and hv6 , although membership probabilities are not available from @xcite , their faintness implies that they are field @xmath1 scuti  type variable stars .",
    "according to the membership information of @xcite , three bright ( @xmath37 14.0 mag ) binary stars ( kv29 , kv35 , and kv37 ) show high ( @xmath38 @xmath39 97% ) membership probabilities .",
    "however , some other bright binary stars have low membership probabilities ; 0% for hv8 and 5% for kv36 . although many fainter ( @xmath40 15.0 mag ) binary stars are located in the region between empirical zams and equal - mass binary sequence , it is difficult to say with certainty whether these stars are cluster members due to the large contamination of the field star population .",
    "binary stars fainter than the main - sequence or brighter than the equal - mass binary sequence are likely non - members of the cluster .",
    "futhermore , as displayed in figure 1 , most of contact binaries are located outside of the cluster half - mass radius ( @xmath41=4.5@xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",

    "several detached binaries are located between the zams and the equal - mass binary sequence on the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "four of them ( hv33 , kv29 , kv35 , and kv37 ) have high membership probability of @xmath42 80% .",
    "we found two w uma  type contact binaries ( hv10 and hv16 ) to be possible cluster members , i.e. , they are inside the cluster half - mass radius and are located between the zams and the binary sequence . however , since the membership information of hv10 and hv16 is not available , we could not ensure whether the open cluster m11 with intermediate - age ( @xmath4200 myr ) can contain contact binaries .",
    "it is of importance to find out the existence of contact binaries in intermediate - age open clusters regarding the understanding of the dynamical evolution of binary systems .",
    "therefore , further proper motion and/or radial velocity survey for contact binaries in the field of m11 should be required to secure their cluster memberships .    in conclusion , because many pulsating stars and eclipsing binaries in the region of m11 are probable members of the cluster , we believe that the cluster m11 is one of the best observing targets for asteroseismology studies as well as for investigating dynamical evolution of binary systems .",
