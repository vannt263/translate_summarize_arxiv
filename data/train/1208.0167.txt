    "structure of monolayers formed during adsorption process is strongly related to properties of underlying substrate , environmental conditions and adsorbate molecules themselves .",
    "earlier works on structured protein coverages indicate a high potential of such layers for material , medical and food sciences as well as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries . in the present study we assumed that strongly anisotropic fibrinogen molecules tend to align along specific axis .",
    "experiments performed earlier show that ordering can have considerable impact on covering layers , e.g. @xcite .",
    "our aim is to find out how the ordering affect maximal random coverage ratio , coverage structure , and adsorption kinetics . to achieve that , we performed extensive numerical simulations on fibrinogen adsorption using rsa algorithm",
    "fibrinogen molecule is modeled as a component of three spheres of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 in diameter , connected by two chains of ten small @xmath3 spheres ; see fig.[fig : fibrynogenmodel ] .     whereas the middle one is a little smaller @xmath4 .",
    "each of the small spheres between them is of @xmath3 diameter.,width=226 ]    such a model was used earlier in @xcite and it turned out to be the most effective in reproducing maximal coverages and adsorption kinetics obtained in experiments .",
    "fibrinogen molecules are placed on a at homogeneous collector surface according to random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) algorithm @xcite , which iteratively repeats the following steps :    1 .",
    ": :    a virtual fibrinogen molecule is created with its centre position on a    collector is chosen randomly according to the uniform probability    distribution ; 2 . : :    the molecule orientation is chosen randomly according to normal    probability distribution having specific expected value    @xmath5 and variance @xmath6 ; 3 . : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbours of the virtual molecule .",
    "the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between each of the spheres is greater    than zero ; 4 . : :    if there is no overlap the virtual molecule is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer .",
    "its position does not change    during further calculations ; 5 .",
    ": :    if there is an overlap the virtual fibrinogen molecule is removed and    abandoned .",
    "the number of rsa iterations @xmath7 is typically expressed in dimensionless time units : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an area covered by single fibrinogen molecule and @xmath10 is a collector size . in case of our simulations algorithm",
    "was stopped after @xmath11 .",
    "example coverages obtained this way are presented in fig.[fig : examples ] .    .",
    "from left to right @xmath12 and @xmath13 which according to ( [ eq : order ] ) corresponds to order parameter @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "the expected direction was @xmath16 for round collectors and @xmath17 for square ones.,width=226 ]    to check the importance of boundaries shape , simulations were performed using both round and square collectors .",
    "obtained results do not show any significant dependence on collector shape .",
    "for further analysis , coverages generated using round collector of @xmath18 diameter were chosen .",
    "as mentioned above , the orientational order inside a layer is controlled by a parameter @xmath6 bound up with the width of gaussian probability density function used during simulations .",
    "however in possible experiments , ordering can be evoked by many different factors , e.g. collector structure , electrostatic interactions or flows .",
    "each of them will generally produce different orientation probability distributions with variance being typically a nonlinear function of experimentally controlled parameters . on the other hand , this study focuses on properties of ordered layers regardless of how they were created .",
    "therefore , it is worth to introduce separate parameter describing orientational order , irrespectively of underlying phenomenons promoting parallel alignment of molecules .",
    "the order parameter can be expressed as follows @xcite : @xmath19 , \\label{eq : order}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is a number of molecules in a layer , @xmath21 $ ] describes a unit vector parallel to orientation of @xmath22-th fibrinogen , and @xmath23 denotes a mean direction .",
    "parameter @xmath24 defined as above is @xmath25 for totally disordered layer and rises up to @xmath26 with growing orientational order .",
    "the maximum value is reached when all molecules inside a coverage are parallely aligned .",
    "the maximal random coverage @xmath27 was estimated by measuring the number of adsorbed molecules @xmath20 : @xmath28 determining its dependence on orientational order was the main aim of this paper .",
    "values obtained from simulations were averaged over at least @xmath29 different collectors .",
    "results are presented in fig.[fig : theta_q ] .    ) .",
    "dots are simulation data whereas the solid line corresponds to square fit : @xmath30 . , width=226 ]",
    "as expected the maximal random coverage grows with orientational order , although the overall impact is only 10% .",
    "the trend of the growth can be successfully fitted with a parabola in which the free term is in concordance with the maximal random coverage for fibrinogen layers determined in @xcite .",
    "to study the structure of obtained fibrinogen layers in more detail we analysed density autocorrelations and distribution of uncovered places.the density autocorrelation function is defined here as : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a probability of finding two molecules in distance @xmath33 and @xmath34 is mean density of molecules inside a covering layer .",
    "fig.[fig : g ] shows @xmath35 function graph for three different values of the order parameter .",
    "it is noteworthy that in case of fibrinogen lack of global order does not mean lack of order at all .",
    "it can be noticed even on snapshots presented in fig.[fig : examples ] ; however , presented @xmath35 proves that .",
    "apart from the statistical noise , all plots look similar . in all the cases",
    "local maxima and minima are in the same positions and correspond only to geometrical properties of the fibrinogen molecule .",
    "another interesting characteristic of a coverage structure is distribution of uncovered places .",
    "it can be of particular importance when the layer undergoes further adsorption of different molecules . to measure this property ,",
    "the uncovered places were filled with balls of a different size giving the higher priority to larger spheres .",
    "it occurs that the size distribution of balls for all values of the order parameter @xmath24 is well approximated by an exponential law : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of balls having radius @xmath33 and @xmath38 is a normalisation constant .",
    "the decay constant @xmath39 depends on orientational order inside a layer as shown in fig.[fig : g_o ] .",
    "defined by ( [ gamma ] ) dependence on orientational ordering .",
    "dots are simulation data whereas the solid line is a quadratic fit : @xmath40.,width=226 ]    lower values of @xmath39 for disordered layers mean more large uncovered spots , which is in line with the expectations .",
    "there are two factors affecting the adsorption kinetics measured in experiments .",
    "the first one is transport process shifting molecules to a surface proximity .",
    "it depends on a given experiment s environmental conditions and therefore hardly enters the general theoretical analysis .",
    "the second factor is varying probability of adsorption .",
    "it decreases in time due to diminishing area of uncovered collector surface .",
    "the dependence between adsorption probability and temporary coverage ratio is commonly known as available surface function ( asf ) and it can be easily measured in rsa simulations .",
    "results are shown in fig.[fig : asf ] .    .",
    "inset shows coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 used in low coverage approximation ( [ asffit ] ) and their dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "squares and triangles represents data obtained from simulations",
    "whereas lines are exponential fits : @xmath43 and @xmath44.,width=226 ]    to compare data for different @xmath24 , the coverage ratios were normalised : @xmath45 . at the limit of low coverage ,",
    "the @xmath46 is commonly approximated by a quadratic fit @xcite : @xmath47 coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be calculated using the least squares method .",
    "their values for different order parameter @xmath24 are presented on the inset in fig.[fig : asf ] .",
    "both plots in this figure shows that the asf decays slower for highly ordered layers which is in agreement with the expectations and previous results for maximal coverage ratio .    at the jamming limit ,",
    "adsorption practically does not depend on transport process because its speed is restricted by amount of uncovered spots .",
    "therefore , due to it s universality , this case has been extensively studied .",
    "for example , for spherical molecules it was shown analytically that the coverage s growth obeys the so called feder s law @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a dimension of a space ( collector and adsorbate ) . relation ( [ fl ] ) has been proved numerically for a number of dimensions @xcite and different adsorbates @xcite . since @xmath50 , equation ( [ fl ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 values can be obtained from plot [ fig : asf ] usind the least squares approximation method .",
    "relation ( [ asffit ] ) is valid within @xmath54 limit , therefore only data for @xmath55 were used for estimation .",
    "results are shown in fig.[fig : a ]     and orientational order @xmath24.,width=226 ]    the statistical errors are quite large due to poor statistics ; however the correlation coefficient in all cases exceeded @xmath56 which means quite good agreement with ( [ asffit ] ) .",
    "as @xmath57 the feder s law is never valid for fibrinogen adsorption in 2d .",
    "parameter @xmath53 fluctuates around @xmath58 to rise up to @xmath59 for the most ordered layer .",
    "it suggests that ordered fibrinogen adsorption kinetics is similar to one dimensional adsorption .",
    "smaller values of @xmath53 for disordered phase are unexpected and do not agree with commonly used fit for elongated molecules : @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the global orientational ordering inside a fibrinogen layer affects the maximal random coverage ratio , however the overall increase is smaller than 10% . the density autocorrelation does not change as the local orientational ordering is present also for globally disordered layers .",
    "the analysis of remaining uncovered spots shows that larger areas are more common in disordered coverages .",
    "adsorption kinetics depends on adsorbate alignment and is faster for parallely oriented molecules .",
    "rsa of fibrinogen does not obey the feder s law in its original form .",
    "for ordered layers the reaction speed is similar to one dimensional systems .",
