    "according to the recent astronomical data , the most part of energy density in the universe ( up to 75% ) is in the ` dark ' form ( such as the so - called ` quintessence ' , inflaton potential , polarization of vacuum and so on ) , which is effectively described by @xmath0-term in the einstein equations ( e.g.  reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "all arguments in favor of the dark energy were obtained so far from the observational data related to very large ( intergalactic ) scales , such as a distribution of supernovae ia as function of their redshift , the spectrum of fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation , the spectra of absorption lines from distant sources , or ly@xmath6 forest , and so on .",
    "is it possible to find a manifestation of the dark energy at much less scales ( e.g.  inside the solar system ) ?",
    "in general , such effects can be expected from the solution of the equations of general relativity for a point - like mass  @xmath7 in the @xmath0-dominated ( de  sitter ) universe , which was obtained by  @xcite a very short time after the original schwarzschild solution .",
    "( more details are given in appendix  [ sec : kottmet ] . )",
    "the presence of @xmath0-term should change , particularly , the standard relativistic shift of mercury s perihelion , predicted by general relativity .",
    "this was the idea by  @xcite , who proposed using the measure of the uncertainty in our knowledge of mercury s perihelion shift to impose the upper bound on  @xmath0 .",
    "the result obtained was not so good as other cosmological estimates but , surprisingly , the accuracy was worse by only @xmath8  orders of magnitude .",
    "so , according to the above - cited authors , improvement of the value of the shift by one or two decimal digits should make such method of determination of  @xmath0 competitive with the observations at large scales .",
    "a more skeptical viewpoint on the same subject was presented recently by @xcite .    in any case , since accuracy of the above method is still insufficient , it was proposed in our previous papers @xcite to utilize the data of radial ( rather than angular ) measurements of the moon to reveal anomalous increase in its orbit produced by the @xmath0-term in metric  ( [ eq : metric_cosm_coord])([eq : g_angl ] ) , under assumption that the central mass  @xmath7 belongs to the earth .",
    "this looks formally as ` local ' hubble expansion .",
    "unfortunately , the result of the earlier works was quite strange : the ` local ' hubble constant was found to be approximately in the middle between zero and the standard intergalactic value , which did not allow a reasonable quantitative interpretation .",
    "the aim of the present work is to describe a much improved analysis of the available observations and to show that its results are in reasonable theoretical agreement with the large - scale data .",
    "the secular increase in planetary radii due to the @xmath0-term , discussed in appendix  [ sec : kottmet ] , formally looks like a kind of the hubble expansion .",
    "so , let us briefly discuss why is it necessary to reexamine the problem of local hubble expansion just in the context of ` dark - energy'-dominated cosmological models ?    in general , hubble dynamics at the small scales is studied for a long time , starting from the pioneering work by  @xcite . although the results by various authors obtained by now were quite contradictory ( e.g.  review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , the most popular point of view was that the hubble expansion manifests itself only at the sufficiently large distances ( from a few mpc ) and is absent at the less scales at all ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there were a few arguments in favor of such conclusion .",
    ", width=257 ]    the first of them is based on the so - called einstein ",
    "straus theorem @xcite .",
    "let us consider the friedmann ",
    "walker ( frw ) cosmological model , uniformly filled with some kind of matter .",
    "next , let us assume that the background matter inside a specified sphere is cut off and concentrated in the point in its centre , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : es_theorem ] .",
    "then , using equations of general relativity , it can be shown that gravitational field inside the empty cavity is described by the purely static schwarzschild metric and begins to experience the cosmological expansion only outside its contact boundary with the background matter distribution ; this boundary moving just with the hubble velocity .",
    "therefore , there is no any hubble expansion in the vicinity of the mass  @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , despite a mathematical elegance of this result , it is absolutely unclear how can the above - mentioned cavities be identified for the real astronomical objects .",
    "moreover , this theorem becomes evidently inapplicable at all in the case of `",
    "dark - energy'-dominated cosmology , because it is meaningless to consider an empty cavity in the vacuum energy distribution .",
    "the second argument against the hubble expansion at small scales is based on a quasi - newtonian treatment of hubble effect in a small volume as a tidal - like action by distant matter ( e.g.  the recent work by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the final conclusion usually derived by this way is that there should be no hubble expansion in the gravitationally - bound systems ( i.e.  the ones whose kinetic energy is less than potential energy ) , such as the planetary systems or stars in galaxies . according to this criterion ,",
    "the hubble expansion should manifest itself only from @xmath9  mpc , as was actually observed for a long time .",
    "unfortunately , the tidal treatment of hubble effect is not well justified from the theoretical point of view . besides , more accurate astronomical measurements in the recent few years revealed a well - formed hubble flow down to the distances of about 1  mpc , which are considerably less than the scale of gravitational unbinding @xcite . moreover , in the @xmath0-dominated cosmology the tidal effects can not be of primary significance just because of the perfectly uniform distribution of the dark energy and , therefore , may be expected only from minor constituents of the universe .    at last ,",
    "one more approach for treating the influence of cosmic expansion on the dynamics of small - scale systems is based on the einstein ",
    "infeld  hoffmann ( eih ) surface integral method , which enables to derive the equations of motion of the particles immediately from the field equations .",
    "this method is based on the integration of field equations over the small closed surfaces surrounding the point - like sources of the field and subsequent use of independence of these integrals on the particular surfaces .",
    "such approach is widely employed to obtain the post - newtonian equations of motion against the background of flat ( minkowski ) space  time and was applied also to the problem of local hubble expansion by @xcite .",
    "it was found that planetary systems should really expand but with a rate much less than for the entire universe .",
    "unfortunately , the eih method also becomes inappropriate if the space is filled everywhere with the dark energy , because the surface integrals are no longer invariant when the integration surfaces are moved .    finally ,",
    "a frequent experimental argument against hubble expansion within the solar system is based on the available constraint on time variation in the gravitational constant derived from the planetary dynamics , which is now as strong as @xmath10  yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "so , as was concluded by these authors , `` the @xmath11 uncertainty is 83  times smaller than the inverse age of the universe , @xmath12  gyr   any isotropic expansion of the earth s orbit which conserves angular momentum will mimic the effect of @xmath13 on the earth s semimajor axis , @xmath14   there is no evidence for such local ( @xmath15  au ) scale expansion of the solar system . ''    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     unfortunately , the above - stated equivalence between the effect of variable @xmath16 and the cosmological expansion is based solely on the newtonian arguments .",
    "a more accurate treatment of this problem in the framework of general relativity for a general case of the multi - component universe is very difficult .",
    "nevertheless , it can be performed in analytic form for the particular case of a point - like mass in the universe filled only with dark energy ( the @xmath0-term ) , and the corresponding results are outlined in appendix  [ sec : kottmet ] . as follows from expressions  ( [ eq : g_tt_approx])([eq : g_angl_approx ] ) , the @xmath0-dependence of a few terms of the resulting metric tensor can really be reinterpreted as the effect of variable @xmath16 , but this is not true in general : there are some terms whose @xmath0-dependence is radically different from any variations in @xmath16 .",
    "since all the commonly - used arguments against the small - scale hubble expansion fail in the case of dark energy , it becomes reasonable to seek for the corresponding effect ; and the most sensitive tool seems to be the lunar laser ranging ( llr ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , if we assume that planetary systems experience the hubble expansion with the same rate as everywhere in the universe ( @xmath17  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) , then average radius of the lunar orbit @xmath18 should increase by approximately 50  cm for the period of 20  years . on the other hand ,",
    "the accuracy of llr measurements during the last 20  years was maintained at the level of @xmath19  cm @xcite ; so the perspective of revealing the local hubble effect looks very good .    the main obstacle that needs to be got around is to exclude the effect of geophysical tides , which also contributes to the secular increase in the earth  moon distance . as is known ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because of dissipative effects , the earth s tidal bulge , formed by the lunar attraction , is not perfectly aligned in the direction to the moon but slightly shifted towards the earth s proper rotation .",
    "therefore , there is a torque moment , which decreases the proper angular momentum of the earth and increases the orbital momentum of the moon . as a result , the average earth ",
    "moon distance  @xmath18 gradually increases in the course of time .    according to the law of conservation of angular momentum , the secular variation in @xmath18",
    "is related to the change in the earth s diurnal period @xmath20 by the simple formula : @xmath21 where @xmath22  cms@xmath2 ( a more detailed discussion can be found , for example , in our previous work , * ? ? ?",
    "so , if @xmath23 is known from independent astrometric measurements of the earth s rotation deceleration with respect to distant objects , then relation  ( [ eq : tidal_effect ] ) can be used to exclude the influence of geophysical tides and , thereby , to reveal a probable presence of local hubble expansion .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath23 is not a well - defined quantity : its values derived from the observations in telescopic era and from the various sets of pre - telescopic data appreciably differ from each other ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is not so important for us now what is the reason for these discrepancies : this may be the systematic errors in the earliest data or , for example , the tectonic processes appreciably changed the earth s moment of inertia just before the period of telescopic observations .",
    "since llr data refer to the last decades , they should be confronted with the most recent values of the earth s rotation deceleration .",
    "the corresponding telescopic data , starting from the middle of the 17th century , were processed by a few researches ; and one of the most detailed compilations was presented recently by @xcite .    of course , the value of secular trend derived from the quite short time series can suffer from the considerable periodic and quasi - periodic variations in @xmath20 .",
    "so , the main aim of our statistical analysis outlined in appendix  [ sec : statan ] was to estimate as carefully as possible the ` mimic ' effect of such variations . taking into account the corresponding uncertainty , the resulting value can be written as @xmath24    the results of the entire analysis of llr vs.  the astrometric data are summarized in table  [ tab : compar ]",
    ". the excessive rate of increase of the lunar orbit @xmath25",
    "cmyr@xmath2 can be attributed to the local hubble expansion with rate @xmath26 this value is appreciably greater than in our earlier work @xcite , where it was found to be only @xmath27  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 .",
    "this was because of using a substantially different rate of the earth s deceleration , @xmath28  syr@xmath2 .",
    "the last - mentioned value was obtained for the first time by @xcite , who used the telescopic observations supplemented by a much longer series of medieval arabian data ; and their result was inaccurately cited in a number of subsequent reviews and monographs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as derived from the telescopic observations alone .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that the basic relation  ( [ eq : tidal_effect ] ) was written under assumption of constant moment of inertia of the earth , which is a questionable item .",
    "for example , over 20  years ago @xcite found that earth s oblateness , commonly characterized by the gravitational harmonic coefficient @xmath29 , was decreasing .",
    "this was interpreted as viscous rebound of the solid earth from the decrease in load due to the last deglaciation .",
    "the observed secular effect @xmath30  yr@xmath2 resulted in the earth s spin - up due to decreasing moment of inertia and , thereby , enabled the above - cited authors to get a reasonable agreement between the various sets of data on the earth s rotation .",
    "therefore , following this approach , it would be unnecessary to take into consideration any other influences , such as the cosmological hubble expansion .",
    "unfortunately , the early results by @xcite were not confirmed by the most recent studies .",
    "for example , as follows from the analysis by @xcite performed over a sufficiently long time interval ( 19852002 ) , the coefficient  @xmath29 has a much smaller secular trend but a considerable oscillatory component with a period of two decades .",
    "an even more striking disagreement with the earlier data was obtained by @xcite , who found that since 1997 or 1998 the secular trend in  @xmath29 has approximately the same absolute value as reported by @xcite but the opposite sign ( namely , @xmath31",
    "yr@xmath2 ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that ( 1 )  a considerable disagreement between the llr and astrometric data still exists and ( 2 )  the coefficient  @xmath29 experiences most probably a quasi - periodic variation with a typical time scale of a few decades .",
    "the last - mentioned property justifies usage of formula  ( [ eq : tidal_effect ] ) , because the temporal variations in the earth s moment of inertia should be averaged out when data on the earth s rotation are taken for the period of @xmath32  years .",
    "how can the value  ( [ eq : h_0^loc ] ) be interpreted ?",
    "it is reasonable to assume that local hubble expansion is formed only by the uniformly - distributed dark energy ( @xmath0-term ) , while the irregularly - distributed ( aggregated ) forms of matter begin to affect the hubble flow at the larger distances , thereby increasing its rate up to the standard intergalactic value .",
    "if the universe is spatially flat and filled only with vacuum and a dust - like ( ` cold ' ) matter , with densities @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , then @xmath35 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "so , if @xmath36 is formed locally only by @xmath37 , while globally by both these terms , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( or , in terms of the relative densities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) , then @xmath41}^{-1/2 } .\\ ] ]    at the commonly - accepted values @xmath42 and @xmath43 , we get @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , @xmath45 which is in reasonable agreement both with the well - known wmap result , @xmath46  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , and with the most recent hubble diagram for a complete sample of type ia supernovae @xcite , whose interpretation requires a slightly reduced value of @xmath36 .",
    "on the other hand , at the given ratio @xmath47 we have @xmath48 so , using the most popular value of the total hubble constant @xmath49  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 and our value of the local hubble constant @xmath50  kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , we get @xmath51 , i.e.  a much less fraction of the dark energy than the commonly - accepted one . therefore , a slightly reduced value of @xmath36 seems to be a preferable option .",
    "as follows from the above analysis , the presence @xmath0-term can give us a reasonable explanation of the anomalous increase in the lunar orbit , consistent with the large - scale astronomical data .",
    "thereby , this is one more argument in favor of the dark energy .    besides , if the local hubble expansion really exists , it should result in profound consequences not only for cosmological evolution but also for the dynamics of planetary systems and other ` small - scale ' astronomical phenomena , which have to be studied in more detail",
