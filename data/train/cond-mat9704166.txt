    "in the last ten years mode coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite has led to a strong interest in the phenomenon of the glass transition , since this theory makes detailed predictions on the dynamics of glass formers in the vicinity of the glass transition and thus challenges the experimentalists to test these predictions .",
    "starting from the microscopic equations of motion , mct derives , by using certain approximations which are believed to be quite reliable for _ simple _ liquids , an equation of motion for the density correlator .",
    "one of the main results of mct is the existence of a dynamical transition at a temperature @xmath3 , at which , in the so - called idealized version of the theory , the dynamics of the system undergoes a transition from an ergodic ( @xmath9 ) to a nonergodic behavior ( @xmath10 ) , and which can be interpreted as a glass transition . due to the presence of ergodicity - restoring processes ,",
    "commonly called `` hopping processes '' , most glass formers show to a certain extent deviations from the predictions of the idealized theory , since this version of mct does not take into account these sort of processes . in the extended version of the theory hopping processes",
    "are taken care of and one finds that in the vicinity of @xmath3 a crossover in the behavior of the dynamics can still be observed  @xcite .",
    "many of the predictions of mct were confirmed by experiments and in numerical simulations on various glass forming systems . for reviews",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the real world",
    "most of the good glass formers are molecular systems .",
    "one of the important differences between molecular systems and simple liquids is that the former have orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) .",
    "the dynamics of these odof can be measured , e.g. , by dielectric spectroscopy , light scattering , and nmr . for the molecular glass formers",
    "salol , e.g. , it has been shown that mct gives a satisfactory description of the relaxation behavior of these systems  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion seems to contradict the outcome of experiments in which the dielectric response of this system was probed  @xcite because of the following fact : mct predicts that for all observables that couple to the density fluctuations the imaginary part of the corresponding susceptibility exhibits a minimum at the same frequency @xmath11 , if one is very close to @xmath3 .",
    "light scattering experiments have shown that in salol this minimum occurs at a frequency of about 2ghz if @xmath12 k  @xcite .",
    "however , dixon _ et al .",
    "_ showed that no such minimum is observed in the dielectric function @xmath13 for frequencies up to 18ghz for @xmath14 k  @xcite thus seemingly contradicting the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite that mct gives a correct description of the dynamics of this system .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn for glycerol . however , in recent extensive dielectric measurements on glycerol this minimum was found and it was shown that the data can be described by the @xmath15-correlator of mct for simple liquids  @xcite , although in this experiment the location of the minimum is indeed different from the one in the light scattering experiment .",
    "this could be due to at least two reasons : first , the mct - equations for _ molecular _ liquids might be different from those for _",
    "simple _ liquids , hence leading to different predictions .",
    "second , the predictions of mct for simple liquids can be used , but corrections to the asymptotic laws of mct have to be taken into account .",
    "these corrections make the reduction theorem invalid and therefore the location of the minimum depends on the observable  @xcite",
    ". we also note that very recently evidence has been given that a minimum exists in @xmath16 for salol also  @xcite .",
    "however , its location remains still undetermined    the above discussion shows that the role of the odof for the glassy dynamics in the supercooled regime is certainly not settled and thus remains an interesting field of research .",
    "one possibility to gain some insight into the dynamics of supercooled liquids is to perform molecular dynamics computer simulations of such systems  @xcite .",
    "simulations of _ simple _ liquids have shown that this method can indeed be very useful to understand the dynamics down to temperatures close to @xmath3  @xcite . for _ supercooled _ molecular liquids , however , only few numerical simulation have been done so far .",
    "_ investigated the dynamics of the ionic glass former @xmath17_{0.4 } [ kno_3]_{0.6}$ ] ( ckn ) , where the @xmath18 unit was treated as a rigid molecule  @xcite and sindzingre and klein studied methanol  @xcite .",
    "otp was investigated by lewis and wahnstrm  @xcite , who modelled the molecule with a rigid isoscale triangle of lennard - jones particles , and by kudchadkar and wiest  @xcite who used a 18-site , three - ring model .",
    "very recently sciortino _",
    "_ presented their results on supercooled h@xmath19o ( also taken as a rigid molecule )  @xcite . in these papers a two - step relaxation process , as predicted by mct , was observed for both , the translational and rotational degrees of freedom . but",
    "a more quantitative analysis in the framework of mct was essentially restricted to the translational degrees of freedom ( tdof ) .",
    "in particular it does not become clear from these studies whether the odof freeze at the same temperature as the tdof do since no detailed analysis with respect to this point was made ( although very recently evidence was given , that for water the freezing temperatures of the odof and the tdof are very close together  @xcite ) .",
    "the investigation of this point is one of the major objectives of the present work . for this",
    "we will focus on the time scale of the @xmath20-relaxation and discuss our findings regarding the @xmath15-relaxation elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that in a very recent paper ma and lai investigated the dynamics of the translational degrees of freedom for a dumb - bell shaped molecule and argued that the molecular character leads to a decrease of the mct parameter @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the molecular system we consider consists of molecules in which two different atoms are connected rigidly .",
    "apart from diatomic molecules with head - tail symmetry , this is the _",
    "simplest _ molecular system one can choose .",
    "although the choice of a linear molecule is of course somewhat special , it is nevertheless interesting to study the dynamics of such a molecular system in the supercooled regime in order to check whether even such a simple system shows the phenomenon of a glass transition .",
    "furthermore the continuous rotational symmetry around the long axis of the molecules simplifies also the theoretical description of this system , as compared to the molecules studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and thus allows to make a more stringent test of the theory .",
    "although the mct equations for a diatomic molecule in a simple liquid  @xcite and for molecular liquids have recently been derived  @xcite , they have not been analyzed in great detail so far .",
    "since the structure of these equations is not identical to that for simple liquids , it is not obvious whether the predictions derived by gtze  @xcite for mct equations which apply to simple liquids are still valid .",
    "thus one of the main motivation of the present work is to test whether these predictions hold also for the molecular system investigated here .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the various correlators and diffusion constants that we will study .",
    "in addition we also summarize those results of mct whose validity we will check for the present system . in section  [ sec3 ] the model as well as the details of the computer simulation are presented .",
    "the results are given in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] and are discussed in the final section in which we also offer our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we define the correlation functions that are studied in this work and recapitulate some of the predictions of mct .    to study the static and dynamical properties of macroscopic systems with @xmath22 particles it is convenient to use correlation functions .",
    "for the translational degrees of freedom it is customary to characterize the dynamics with the help of the van hove correlation function , or its space fourier transform , the intermediate scattering function . for the rotational degrees of freedom",
    "convenient correlation functions are the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 which are defined as follows :    @xmath25    and its self part @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the legendre polynomial of order @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the normalized orientational vector of the @xmath30-th molecule .",
    "these orientational correlation functions are straightforward generalizations of the intermediate scattering function to the case where also odof are present .",
    "more details on this point are given in ref .",
    "the experimental relevance of the functions @xmath23 is given by the fact that for @xmath31 and @xmath32 they can be measured in dielectric and light scattering experiments , respectively .",
    "we also note that it is often assumed ( cf . , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the cross terms in @xmath23 can be neglected . in that case the experiments",
    "would also yield information on @xmath33 .",
    "we will discuss this point below .    besides the intermediate scattering function or the correlators given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) and  ( [ eq1 ] ) , the dynamics of the system can also be studied by means of the auto - correlation functions of the velocities @xmath34 of the particles    @xmath35    or the corresponding one of the angular velocities @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the angle between @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "it was recently shown that @xmath40 is particularly useful to study the freezing of the odof  @xcite . since the translational and rotational diffusion constants , @xmath6 and @xmath5 , respectively , can be obtained by means of a green - kubo relation from eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) , respectively , the significance of these time correlation functions is obvious .    in the strongly supercooled regime @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "exhibit a negative , slowly decaying long time tail .",
    "this makes the numerical calculation of @xmath6 and @xmath5 from the green - kubo relation a difficult task , if the temperatures are low .",
    "therefore it is customary to use the corresponding einstein relations , which are mathematically equivalent to the green - kubo identity . for the tdof @xmath6",
    "is then determined from the mean squared displacement :    @xmath43    to obtain the analogon to this equation for the odof we replace @xmath44 by the corresponding variable @xmath45 , which is defined as    @xmath46    in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) we thus obtain the following einstein relation for the odof :    @xmath47    note that @xmath45 is not bounded , in contrast to @xmath48 , which is restricted to the surface of a unit sphere .",
    "this is the reason , why a replacement of @xmath44 by @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) would yield @xmath49 .",
    "let us now recapitulate those predictions of the idealized version of mct which are relevant for the present work .",
    "more detail can be found in refs .",
    "the theory predicts that , in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 , all time correlation functions @xmath50 which couple to the density correlation function should show a two - step relaxation behavior , i.e. exhibit a plateau - like region when plotted versus the logarithm of time .",
    "the time window in which @xmath51 is in the vicinity of this plateau is called the @xmath15-relaxation regime . the time window",
    "in which the correlator falls below this plateau is called the @xmath20-relaxation regime .    mct predicts that upon approaching @xmath3 from above , the @xmath20-relaxation time @xmath52 diverges with a power - law , i.e.    @xmath53    with a critical exponent @xmath54 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 are predicted to be independent of the correlator .",
    "furthermore the theory predicts that also the translational diffusion constant @xmath6 shows in the vicinity of @xmath3 a power - law behavior , i.e.    @xmath55    with the same @xmath4 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "finally the theory makes the prediction that the correlators should obey the so - called time - temperature superposition principle ( ttsp ) .",
    "this means that if a correlator @xmath56 is plotted versus the reduced time @xmath57 , the curves corresponding to the different temperatures fall , in the @xmath20-relaxation regime , on a master curve @xmath58 , i.e.    @xmath59    the shape of which is approximated well by a kohlrausch - williams - watts function , i.e. @xmath60 , where the amplitude @xmath61 and the exponent @xmath15 are _ not _ universal , i.e. will depend on @xmath51 .",
    "the model we investigate is a one - component system of rigid , diatomic molecules .",
    "each molecule is composed of two different lennard - jones particles , in the following denoted by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which are separated by a distance @xmath63 and each of which has the same mass @xmath64 .",
    "the interaction between two molecules is given by the sum of the interaction between the four particles which is given by the lennard - jones potential @xmath65 were @xmath66 .",
    "the lennard - jones parameters are given by @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 and were chosen such that the system did not show any sign of crystallization even at the lowest temperatures investigated here . in the following",
    "we will use reduced units and use @xmath71 as the unit of length , @xmath72 as the unit of energy ( setting @xmath73 ) and @xmath74 as the unit of time .",
    "if the atoms are argon - like this time unit corresponds to approximately 0.3ps .",
    "the choice of the intramolecular distance @xmath63 between the @xmath61 and @xmath62 particles requires some consideration . on the one hand @xmath63",
    "has to be large enough to allow for a sufficiently strong coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom . on the other hand it has to be so small that firstly the formation of liquid crystalline structures is unlikely  @xcite and that secondly the energy barrier involved in the intersection of two molecules is so large , that at the temperatures and on the time scale of the simulation such a crossing does not occur .",
    "we found that a value of 0.5 is a good compromise .    in order to make the simulation more realistic we did it at constant external pressure @xmath75=1.0 .",
    "for this we equilibrated the system in the ( @xmath76 ) ensemble , using the algorithm proposed by andersen  @xcite and by setting the mass of the piston to 0.05 .",
    "the length of these equilibration runs always exceeded the typical relaxation time of the system at the temperature considered , which allows us to conclude that in the subsequent production runs we were investigating the equilibrium dynamics of the system .",
    "after having determined from this equilibration run the appropriate density of the system for the temperature of interest , we fixed the total density to the so obtained density and started a production run in the microcanonical ensemble using the rattle algorithm  @xcite .",
    "note that it is advisable to make the production run in the microcanonical ensemble if one wants to investigate the dynamics of the system , since the algorithms used for constant pressure simulations introduce an artificial dynamics which might lead to unphysical results .",
    "the step size we chose was 0.01 for the higher and 0.016 or 0.02 for the lower temperatures . for runs shorter or equal than 1.4@xmath77 time units these step sizes are sufficiently small to allow to neglect the drift in the total energy during the runs .",
    "this is not the case for the long runs at the two lowest temperatures which had a length of 3.0@xmath77 and @xmath78 time units , respectively , ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 time steps ) . during",
    "these runs the value of the total energy was reseted periodically ( about 30 times during the whole run ) to its value at the start of the run by rescaling the velocities of all the particles appropriately .",
    "since this interference with the dynamics is only very weak it can be expected that the final result will essentially be independent of it .",
    "the temperatures we investigated are @xmath81 , 3.0 , 2.0 , 1.4 , 1.1 , 0.85 , 0.70 , 0.632 , 0.588 , 0.549 , 0.520 , 0.500 , 0.489 , and 0.477 .",
    "the total number of molecules was 500 and in order to improve the statistics of the results we averaged at each temperature over at least eight independent runs .",
    "before we start to present the results on how the odof freezes , it is useful to investigate the dynamics of the tdof , since this allows us to estimate the temperature range in which the system is supercooled . therefore we computed from the mean square displacement of the center of the molecules the translational diffusion constant @xmath6 .",
    "mct predicts that , in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xmath3 , the diffusion constant will show a power - law [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) ] .",
    "thus we fitted our data for @xmath6 with such a law , using @xmath3 as a fit parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the diffusion constant versus @xmath82 in a double logarithmic plot .",
    "also included is the fit with the power - law of eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "we recognize that this fit is very good for a surprisingly large range in @xmath83 and @xmath6 . in particular",
    "this range is significantly larger than the one found for the atomic lennard - jones system  @xcite . since no analogous analysis was done for the molecular systems studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , and the range in @xmath6 explored in ref .",
    "@xcite was significantly smaller than the one considered here , it is at the moment not clear whether the fact that the power - law can be observed over such an extended range in @xmath6 is a peculiarity of the present system or whether it is a general feature of molecular systems .    from the figure we also note that at the two lowest temperatures the diffusion constant is significantly higher than it would be estimated from the power - law which fits the data well at higher temperatures .",
    "the reason for this are likely the so - called `` hopping processes ''  @xcite , the contributions to the relaxation that are not accounted for in the _ idealized _ version of the mct .",
    "thus it can be expected that for such low temperatures the predictions of this idealized version of the theory are no longer valid .",
    "the value of the critical temperature @xmath3 is @xmath84 which allows us to conclude that the tdof of the system become very slow in the vicinity of this temperature .",
    "this is also corroborated by our investigation of the intermediate scattering function ( coherent as well as incoherent ) for which we found that their @xmath20-relaxation time shows also a power - law with a critical temperature at 0.475  @xcite .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath4 of the power - law for @xmath6 is 2.20 , which is in the range of values found for @xmath4 in simple supercooled systems . in passing we",
    "mention that for this molecular system the dynamics of the tdof is qualitatively similar to the one of simple liquids  @xcite and that therefore the molecular character of the particles does not seem to affect the dynamics of the tdof significantly .",
    "we now focus our attention to the odof .",
    "the first quantity we investigate is the correlation function @xmath0 which was defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a we show this time correlation function for all temperatures investigated . from this figure",
    "we recognize that for high temperatures @xmath0 decays quickly to zero . at intermediate temperatures",
    "it starts to show a weak shoulder which , on lowering the temperature further , becomes more pronounced .",
    "the time range for which this shoulder is observed coincides with the one in which a plateau is observed in the intermediate scattering function  @xcite and thus can be identified with the @xmath15-relaxation regime .    from this figure",
    "we also recognize that for intermediate and low temperatures the shape of the curves in the @xmath20-relaxation regime seems to be almost independent of temperature , i.e. that the so - called time temperature superposition principle ( ttsp ) holds [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) ] . in order to investigate this point",
    "closer we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b the same curves versus the rescaled time @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the @xmath20-relaxation time .",
    "we define @xmath86 to be the time it takes the correlation function to decay to @xmath87 of its initial value . from this figure",
    "we recognize that the ttsp does not hold very well , in that the slope of the curves at @xmath88 changes significantly even at low temperatures .",
    "thus we conclude that for this type of correlation function of the odof the ttsp does not hold very well , which is in contrast with the behavior of the tdof of simple liquids  @xcite and of the present system  @xcite as well as for @xmath0 for the otp model studied by wahnstm and lewis  @xcite .",
    "we also note that defining the @xmath20-relaxation time @xmath86 in a different way , namely by the time it takes the correlation function to decay to 10% of its initial value , does not change this conclusion , since the ttsp does not hold with this second definition of @xmath89 either .",
    "next we investigate the time and temperature dependence of @xmath1 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . from the upper panel of the figure",
    "we see that @xmath1 decays qualitatively similar to @xmath0 ( fig .  [ fig2]a ) . for the former , however , the height of the shoulder is lower than the one in @xmath0 , which is reasonable , since to a first approximation this height is given by the value of the second legendre polynomial evaluated at the height of the shoulder in @xmath90 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] .",
    "note that this height is a measure for the corresponding nonergodicity parameter @xmath91 at @xmath3 .    since the area under the @xmath20-peak and under the remaining part of the spectrum @xmath92 ( i.e. the critical decay and the microscopic peak )",
    "are related to @xmath93 and to @xmath94 , respectively , our result suggests that the minimum between the two peaks is less pronounced for @xmath95 than for @xmath96 , provided that the width of the microscopic peak is about the same for @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this could be the reason why the detection of this minimum is so difficult in dielectric measurements , i.e. @xmath31 , whereas it was readily found in light scattering experiments .    from fig .",
    "[ fig3]b we recognize that for this correlation function the ttsp holds well for times larger than @xmath97 , the @xmath20-relaxation time for @xmath1 , but that for shorter times quite significant discrepancies are observed , as it was the case for @xmath90 .",
    "thus we come to the conclusion that the relaxation behavior of @xmath90 and @xmath98 are qualitatively different .",
    "since the time dependence of @xmath90 seems to differ from the one of @xmath98 , we have also studied the one of @xmath33 for @xmath99 , which , for the lowest temperature investigated , are show in fig .",
    "[ fig3_new]b . from this figure",
    "we recognize that i ) the height of the plateau decreases with increasing @xmath28 , which can be rationalized by the same reasoning given above , ii ) that with increasing @xmath28 the correlators seem to show more and more a logarithmic time dependence in the @xmath15-relaxation regime , and iii ) that the correlators for odd values of @xmath28 decay faster than the ones for even values of @xmath28 .",
    "this effect can be understood by taking into account that at low temperatures the molecules make jump - like orientational flips of @xmath8 , described in more detail below , which lead to a relaxation in @xmath33 if @xmath28 is odd , but do not affect the correlators with even values of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore we have found that with increasing value of @xmath28 the ttsp holds better and better  @xcite thus showing that from a qualitative point of view the correlators for the odof become more similar to the ones of the tdof .",
    "in addition to the self parts , @xmath33 we have also determined the time dependence of @xmath100 , one of the collective correlation functions of the odof [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ] .",
    "this correlation function is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3_n_n ] for all temperatures investigated .",
    "although the noise in the data is significantly larger than the one in @xmath90 , as it is often the case for collective quantities , we can clearly recognize that the time dependence of @xmath101 is qualitatively similar to the one of @xmath90 and that the ttsp , cf .",
    "[ fig3_n_n ] , does not seem to hold .",
    "furthermore we note that , e.g. , at the lowest temperature and for @xmath102 time units , @xmath0 is about 25% larger than @xmath100 , which demonstrates that the cross terms in @xmath100 should not be neglected , at least not in the strongly supercooled regime .    from figs .",
    "[ fig2]a ,  [ fig3]a and [ fig3_n_n]a we recognize that with decreasing temperature the relaxation of the odof slows down dramatically .",
    "thus it is interesting to investigate the temperature dependence of the relaxation times . since we have found that the diffusion constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) as well as the @xmath20-relaxation times of the tdof  @xcite show a power - law dependence on temperature , with the same critical temperature @xmath3 , we checked whether also the @xmath20-relaxation times @xmath86 , @xmath97 and @xmath103 can be fitted with such a power - law ( with the same @xmath104 ) . that this is indeed possible for about two orders of magnitude in @xmath105 ,",
    "is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] where we show these quantities versus @xmath82 in a double logarithmic plot . as it was the case for the diffusion constant @xmath6 ,",
    "the values of @xmath105 for the two lowest temperatures deviate from the power - laws , since also here the relaxation is too fast , which is likely to be related to hopping processes .",
    "thus we conclude that these processes affect the odof also .    from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we also note that the fitted power - laws do not extend to such high temperatures as they did in the case of the diffusion constant .",
    "this is evidence that , similar to _ simple _ liquids , the presence of a large temperature range for which such a power - law is observed is rather the exception than the rule .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath4 of the three power - laws [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) ] , are 1.66 , 2.42 and 1.52 for @xmath89 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 . since the critical exponent for the diffusion constant is 2.20 , we thus find that the four critical exponents are all different from each other , which disagrees with the prediction of mct for simple liquids .",
    "however , if we determine the critical exponents for @xmath33 for @xmath108 we find the values 2.25 , 2.78 , 2.55 and 2.80 .",
    "these values have to be compared with the critical exponent for the tdof , which is around 2.6  @xcite , and thus quite close to the one of @xmath33 for the larger values of @xmath28 .",
    "thus this is more evidence that the latter correlators behave qualitatively similar to the ones for the tdof .",
    "we also mention that a power - law fit to @xmath109 and @xmath107 , with the critical temperature @xmath3 as a free parameter , leads to a slightly improved fit .",
    "the optimal values of the critical temperature were to within 2% equal to 0.475 , the value of @xmath3 from the diffusion constant .",
    "thus we find that the odof , measured by @xmath33 and @xmath101 , would indeed freeze very close to @xmath104 , if the hopping processes were absent .",
    "furthermore we note that a fit of @xmath89 and @xmath106 with the popular vogel - fulcher law , @xmath110 , also works remarkably well .",
    "in particular we find that this functional form is able to fit the data well at _ all _ lower temperatures , i.e. also the data points at the two lowest temperatures , for which the power - law failed to fit the data .",
    "thus we conclude that if seen as a mere fitting function the vogel - fulcher law gives the better fit than the power - law .",
    "however , the vogel - fulcher temperature @xmath111 was determined to be 0.328 and 0.386 for @xmath89 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "thus we find that the two temperatures differ by about 20% , hence indicating that according to the vogel - fulcher fits there is no unique temperature at which the system ceases to relax .",
    "therefore this sort of fit is , from a physical point of view , less appealing .    the @xmath20-relaxation times @xmath112 and @xmath103 are analogous quantities to the @xmath20-relaxation time @xmath52 of the intermediate scattering function . since in supercooled liquids the temperature dependence of @xmath105 and of the diffusion constant can be different ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) it is interesting to investigate also the _ rotational _ diffusion constant @xmath5 , and compare it with the temperature dependence of the relaxation times @xmath89 and @xmath106 .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the calculation of @xmath5 is numerically difficult when one uses a green - kubo relation .",
    "instead it is much simpler to compute @xmath5 from the einstein relation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) . in fig .",

    "we recognize that , analogous to the mean square displacement  @xcite , @xmath115 shows at short times a power - law with exponent 2.0 , which corresponds to the free rotational motion of the molecules . for high temperature",
    "this type of motion crosses over directly into a diffusional behavior , i.e. @xmath116 is given by a power - law with exponent 1.0 .",
    "this is not the case for the low temperatures , where the time regimes of the free rotation and the one of the diffusive behavior are separated by a time regime where the increase of @xmath117 is slower than diffusive .",
    "the time at which this subdiffusive behavior _ starts _ is essentially the same as the one in which also the mean squared displacement of the particles ( msd ) starts to show a subdiffusive behavior  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this the time where @xmath118 starts to show the diffusive behavior is , at the lowest temperatures , significantly less ( by about 1 - 2 decades ) than the times where the msd starts to show the diffusive behavior .",
    "thus , despite the qualitative similarity of the time dependence of @xmath116 and the msd there are some distinct differences between the two quantities and thus we conclude that the plateau - like region in @xmath119 should _ not _ be identified with the @xmath15-relaxation regime .",
    "we will come back to this point later .    from the time dependence of @xmath118 it is simple to compute @xmath5",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) ] .",
    "note that , because @xmath120 reaches its diffusive limit at shorter times than the msd does , the rotational diffusion constant can be calculated reliably from a relatively short run , an observation of which we will make use of below .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we show the temperature dependence of @xmath5 in an arrhenius plot . in order to facilitate the comparison between the rotational and translational diffusion constant",
    ", we have included the latter in the figure as well .",
    "( note that we have multiplied @xmath6 by 15 in order to make @xmath6 and @xmath5 to coincide at high temperatures .",
    "also it should be remembered that @xmath6 and @xmath5 have different units . ) we see that for temperatures less than 2.0 the data ( diamonds ) can be fitted well with an arrhenius law ( solid straight line ) .",
    "furthermore we recognize that the temperature dependence of @xmath5 follows the one of @xmath6 for high temperatures but that when the system starts to become supercooled , the curve for @xmath6 drops significantly below the one for @xmath5 .",
    "thus we find that at high enough temperatures the odof and the tdof couple strongly enough to show the same temperature dependence of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , which is in agreement with the well - known stokes - einstein- and stokes - einstein - debye - relations . for lower temperatures",
    "@xmath6 shows the power - law discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the reason for which are likely the mode coupling effects .",
    "in contrast to this , @xmath5 shows an arrhenius law from which we can conclude that the rotational motion of the molecule is an activated process . we will study this process in more detail below .",
    "we have also checked whether at low temperatures , i.e. @xmath121 the temperature dependence of @xmath5 can be fitted well by a power - law and found that this is indeed possible with a critical temperature around 0.38 ( dashed line in fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this temperature is significantly lower than the critical temperature @xmath3 we found for the diffusion constant , the intermediate scattering function and the relaxation times of @xmath33 and @xmath101 , which was 0.475 . in order to discriminate between the two functional forms we made use of the observation described above that the rotational diffusion constant can be determined from a relatively short run ( compared to the @xmath20-relaxation times of the tdof ) ,",
    "see fig .",
    "thus we used the temperature dependence of the density ( obtained from our equilibrated runs at temperatures @xmath122 ) to estimate the volume of the system at @xmath123 .",
    "we then set up the volume of the system such that its density corresponded to this extrapolated value and quenched the system to @xmath123 .",
    "after allowing the system to relax for @xmath124 time units we started to measure the time dependence of @xmath125 for three independent runs .",
    "note that this time is clearly not sufficient to equilibrate the system with respect to its tdof , but it should at least allow the system to get reasonably close to its equilibrium state at this temperature . the so obtained @xmath126 is included in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as well ( bottom curve ) .",
    "we see that even at this low temperature the diffusive rotational behavior can be observed on the time scale of our simulation .",
    "thus we could extract the corresponding value of @xmath5 and have included it in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as well .",
    "this data point lies reasonably close to an extrapolation for the previously fitted arrhenius law and is completely off the curve for the power - law .",
    "( the fact that this point lies slightly above this arrhenius law can be understood by taking into account that at this temperature the tdof are not quite relaxed .",
    "hence it can be expected that all the relaxation times are smaller than they would be in an equilibrated sample and that therefore the measured diffusion constant is too large  @xcite . )",
    "thus we conclude that the rotational diffusion constant , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , follows an arrhenius law even at very low temperatures and that it is very unlikely that its temperature dependence is given by a power - law .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have seen that the relaxation times of the orientational correlation functions show a power - law dependence on temperature and that the critical temperature @xmath3 is very close to the one of the translational diffusion constant or the one of the intermediate scattering function . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] it is recognized , however , that the rotational diffusion constant @xmath5 does _ not _ show any exceptional temperature dependence in the vicinity of @xmath3 . at first view",
    "these two facts seem to contradict each other , but as we will show now , this is not the case at all . in order for the time correlation functions @xmath90 and @xmath98 to decay to zero it is necessary that the orientation of the molecules changes by an angle on the order of @xmath8 and @xmath127 in the case of @xmath90 and @xmath98 , respectively . in order to undergo such a large change of orientation",
    ", a molecule has to wait until the cage formed by the surrounding molecules breaks up .",
    "the time for this to happen is related to the relaxation time of the translational degrees of freedom and thus we find that the relaxation times of @xmath90 and @xmath98 become very large when the temperature approaches @xmath3 .    for the rotational diffusion constant",
    "the situation is different . as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath5 remains finite as long as there is a possibility that @xmath128 increases ( linearly ) with time . at low temperatures",
    "a molecule will not be able to make large changes of its orientation but a small librational ( tumbling ) motion is still possible ( for the tdof this corresponds to the rattling of the particles in their cage ) , which was nicely demonstrated by renner _",
    "for a system of infinitely thin rods on a cubic lattice  @xcite .",
    "it is not hard to see that this librational motion gives rise to a diffusive movement of the @xmath129-component of the vector @xmath130 and hence to a finite value of @xmath5 ( here the @xmath129-axis is defined by the molecular axis of the molecule at time zero ) .    in order to see this effect clearer",
    "we have investigated the orientational dynamics of the molecules at @xmath123 in more detail . at this low temperature",
    "the orientation of most of the molecules stays for a long time in the vicinity of the direction it was at time @xmath131 .",
    "thus we determined the mean orientation of the @xmath129-axis of each molecule by averaging its direction over a period of @xmath132 time units .",
    "note that such a mean direction makes only sense if the orientation of the molecule does not change significantly .",
    "hence we will restrict the following analysis to only those molecules for which the maximum deviation from this mean axis was less than @xmath133 . in the considered time window",
    "this is the case for 74% of the molecules .",
    "having determined the mean @xmath129-axis , we chose a @xmath134 and @xmath135 axis perpendicular to the @xmath129 axis and computed the time dependence of @xmath136 .",
    "the time dependence of these three functions are shown in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath137 is indeed significantly larger than @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "this is in accordance with the picture put forward above that the orientational diffusion of the molecules in the @xmath129 direction is much larger than the one in the @xmath134 and @xmath135 direction .",
    "we also recognize that the latter ones are not _ completely _ suppressed which is likely to be due to the fact that the cage in which the molecule sits is still slowly changing with time .",
    "it is important to notice that similar arguments do not hold for the tdof .",
    "the rattling of the center of mass within a cage is isotropic an the average .",
    "it is the direction of the molecular axis that breaks this isotropy on a `` mesoscopic '' time scale .",
    "the fact that at low temperatures the molecules perform for a long time a librational motion can also be demonstrated nicely by considering the auto - correlation function @xmath40 of the angular velocity @xmath140 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) . as was illustrated by renner _",
    ", @xmath40 is expected to show a plateau with a height equal or less than 0.25 if the motion of the molecule is of a librational type  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig7_n ] we show the time dependence of @xmath141 for all temperatures investigated . from this figure",
    "we recognize that the _ short _ time relaxation time of @xmath141 _ decreases _ with decreasing temperature and that at low temperatures the correlation function shows indeed a plateau .",
    "a different way to study the orientational motion of the molecules is to investigate the time dependence of the distribution function @xmath142 , which is defined analogously to the self part of the van hove correlation function , i.e. @xmath143\\rangle \\quad , \\label{eq18}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 is the unit vector parallel to the axis of molecule @xmath145 at time @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we show @xmath142 for different temperatures . note that @xmath142 is defined such that for long times it approaches 1.0 for all values of @xmath147 . from fig .",
    "[ fig8]a we recognize that for @xmath148 this function decays monotonically in @xmath147 for all times .",
    "this changes when the temperature is decreased to @xmath149 , fig .",
    "[ fig8]b , since then , e.g. , the curve for @xmath150 ( bold dashed curve ) shows a small additional peak at @xmath8 which is separated from the main peak at @xmath151 by a shallow minimum around @xmath152 .",
    "this additional peak stems from molecules which underwent a rotation of @xmath8 .",
    "this feature becomes much more pronounced when the temperature is decreased further to @xmath153 ( fig .",
    "[ fig8]c ) .",
    "the mentioned minimum now exists for a large time range before it starts to disappear on the time scale of the @xmath20-relaxation . at even lower temperature , @xmath123 ( fig .  [ fig8]d )",
    ", the minimum does not show any sign to fill up at all on the time scale of our simulation .",
    "however , we see that the peak at @xmath8 is still observable , which means that a significant fraction of the molecules made a flip of @xmath8 .    to study these @xmath8 jumps on a more microscopic level , we have also investigated the time dependence of the angle @xmath147 of _ individual _ molecules . from such studies we found that at low temperatures , i.e. @xmath123 , the @xmath129-axis of the molecules stays for a long time in the vicinity of its orientation at @xmath131 and then undergoes _ relatively _ quickly a flip of @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for three representative trajectories ) .",
    "the typical time for this flip is around 50 time units , but also faster ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig9]b ) as well as slower transitions can be observed .",
    "this transition time is relatively long compared to the time scale of a ( translational ) vibration of a molecule in its cage which is on the order of two time units .",
    "therefore we conclude that such a @xmath8 flip is not a fast process in which the molecule overcomes one barrier in a quasi - ballistic way , but rather the sum of a quick succession of smaller jumps .",
    "finally we mention that the molecules do not show these sort of little jumps neither before nor after they undergo a @xmath8 flip which shows that these little jumps are associated with the flips .",
    "the main motivation of this paper has been to investigate the dynamics of the orientational degrees of freedom in a supercooled molecular liquid .",
    "this was done by means of a md - simulation for a very simple molecular system , a liquid of diatomic , rigid molecules .",
    "the first question we addressed was how the translational and the orientational degrees of freedom ( tdof and odof , respectively ) slow down if the temperature is decreased and the system becomes strongly supercooled . since the mode coupling theory ( mct ) is presently the only microscopic theory which predicts , in its idealized version , a glass transition at a temperature @xmath3 , we have checked the consistency of our results with the predictions of the theory .    in the @xmath20-relaxation regime mct",
    "predicts in the vicinity of @xmath3 a power - law behavior for the temperature dependence of the corresponding relaxation times and the diffusion constants [ cf .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) ] .",
    "we find that the translational diffusion constant @xmath6 as well as the relaxation times @xmath105 for the orientational correlators @xmath33 and @xmath101 can indeed be fitted by a power - law and that the transition temperature @xmath3 is @xmath154 .",
    "this fit describes the data for @xmath6 and @xmath105 very well for about four and two decades , respectively .",
    "the corresponding exponents are not universal , but vary between 1.52 and 2.45 .",
    "the next interesting result is that the rotational diffusion constant @xmath5 , as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , shows a significantly different temperature dependence than the quantities just discussed . for high temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath6 are proportional to each other , in accordance with the hydrodynamic stokes - einstein and stokes - einstein - debye relations .",
    "however , below a temperature @xmath155 , which is far above @xmath3 , @xmath6 is described well by the mentioned power - law , whereas @xmath5 shows an arrhenius dependence .",
    "we find that @xmath156 is the temperature at which the cage - effect starts to become important , i.e. the system begins to be supercooled .",
    "this can be inferred from the fact that at @xmath156 @xmath157 as well as @xmath125 start to show anomalous diffusion behavior at intermediate times .",
    "thus we conclude that the breakdown of this aspect of the hydrodynamic equations and the onset of the cage - effect in supercooled liquids occur at the same temperature .",
    "we stress , however , that the different temperature dependence of @xmath6 and @xmath5 below @xmath156 is _ not _ related to the similar phenomenon observed in experiments  @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the relaxation of the orientational vector @xmath158 of the @xmath30-th molecule is studied .",
    "the measured quantity corresponds to the correlator @xmath24 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] . in most theoretical approaches the rotational dynamics",
    "is described by a smoluchowski equation in which it is assumed that the angular velocities can be eliminated adiabatically .",
    "this crucial assumption , and the subsequent linearization , leads to an _ exponential _ relaxation with a @xmath20-relaxation time @xmath109 which is proportional to @xmath159  @xcite . using this relationship , @xmath5",
    "can then be deduced .",
    "our results at lower temperatures are not consistent with this theoretical result , because i ) @xmath160 is _ not _ proportional to @xmath161^{-1 } $ ] and ii ) @xmath162 .",
    "the reason for this is the nonexponential relaxation we have found for which the proportionality of @xmath5 and @xmath163 and the relation @xmath164 is not granted .    in the vicinity of @xmath3",
    "the data for @xmath6 and @xmath109 deviate from the power - law observed at intermediate temperatures .",
    "( the same deviations are found for the @xmath20-relaxation times of the coherent and incoherent intermediate scattering function of the center of the molecules  @xcite ) .",
    "this is likely due to the hopping processes which restore ergodicity even at low temperatures .",
    "if hopping of the center of mass of the molecules becomes important at lower temperatures , this should be seen in the self part of the van hove correlation function @xmath165  ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "surprisingly , even at the lowest temperature , @xmath153 , @xmath165 does not show any sign of a second ( smaller ) peak at a distance @xmath166 , which corresponds to the mean distance between two neighboring molecules  @xcite . that @xmath167 nevertheless deviates from a power - law at low @xmath83",
    "may be explained by the jump - like reorientations of the odof which we have identified in the distribution function @xmath142 as @xmath8-flips .",
    "these jumps , which were also observed in earlier md - simulations  @xcite , may lead to a local `` melting '' of the neighborhood of a molecule which just jumped , whereby allowing a translational diffusion without the molecule having to jump over the walls of its cage .",
    "the rotational diffusion measured by @xmath5 is an activated process , at least for lower temperatures .",
    "its @xmath83-dependence can be described by an arrhenius law even for a temperature @xmath123 which is far below @xmath3 .",
    "this arrhenius dependence is somewhat reminiscent to the temperature dependence of the johari - goldstein @xmath15-peak in the dynamic susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "since we have shown that the arrhenius dependence of @xmath5 is related to the librational motion of the molecules , one thus might speculate whether the dynamics leading to the @xmath15-peak is indeed related to such librations .",
    "however , in order to decide this one would have to investigate the equilibrium dynamics of the systems at significantly lower temperatures than it is presently possible .    regarding the time dependence of the various correlators at low temperatures we have found a two - step relaxation process , with a strongly nonexponential behavior , for all of them .",
    "this is in agreement with the results in refs .",
    "@xcite and also with mct",
    ". however , in contrast to the prediction of mct , the time - temperature superposition principle does not seem to work very well for the orientational correlators investigated here , although it does so for @xmath33 with @xmath168 and for the correlators of the tdof .",
    "this shows that , despite the fact that the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the tdof and the one of the odof are very similar , the relaxation dynamics of the two types of correlation functions is , if @xmath31 or @xmath32 , qualitatively different .",
    "finally we mention that at low temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath100 differ from each other in the @xmath20-relaxation regime by about 25% , which demonstrates that the cross - terms in @xmath100 should not be neglected .      electronic mail : kob@moses.physik.uni-mainz.de + http://www.cond-mat.physik.uni-mainz.de/ kob / home_kob.html electronic mail : schillin@einstein.physik.uni-mainz.de w. gtze in _ liquids , freezing and the glass transition _ , eds .",
