    "the most commonly used microscopic approach for the study of collective vibrational states in many - fermion systems is the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . in this theory",
    "the lowest collective excitations result from the action of phonon operators @xmath0 on a state @xmath1 which is defined by the condition that @xmath2 .",
    "this state represents the ground state of the system .",
    "it is a distinctive feature of rpa that multiphonon states , i.e. states obtained by repeated actions of phonon operators on the ground state , are eigenstates of the hamiltonian with energies forming a harmonic spectrum .",
    "the existence of states which can be approximately described as corresponding to the multiple excitation of low - lying and/or high - lying phonons is well established in atomic nuclei .",
    "however , deviations from the harmonic picture are also observed and their influence on several processes has been analysed@xcite .    in a standard derivation of the rpa equations , a crucial point",
    "is represented by the so - called quasi - boson approximation ( qba ) .",
    "this is a rather crude approximation which causes the @xmath0 operators to behave as boson operators in spite of their ( composite ) fermionic structure . overcoming this approximation",
    "has represented the starting point of many attempts aiming at improving rpa .",
    "one of the line of research in such a context has been based on a reformulation of the whole theory in a boson formalism@xcite .",
    "in other words , the @xmath0 operators have been defined from the beginning in terms of true boson operators and all the fermion operators of interest have been replaced , via a mapping procedure , by their boson images .",
    "the rpa - type equations that one constructs in this formalism depend , of course , on the degree of expansion of the boson hamiltonian . truncating this expansion at the lowest order , i.e. at two - boson terms only , gives the boson counterpart of rpa . including higher - order terms in the boson image of the hamiltonian",
    "provides a natural way to reach a higher level of approximation . besides that",
    ", the inclusion of these terms has another important effect : it leads to a coupling among multiphonon states .",
    "states which result from a diagonalization in a m - phonon space are therefore superpositions of zero- , one- , ... , m - phonon states . such a diagonalization is expected to lead to a further improved degree of approximation as well as to cause anharmonicities in the spectrum .",
    "calculations in this boson formalism have been performed in the recent past for atomic nuclei@xcite considering a hamiltonian truncated at four - boson terms and diagonalizing it in the space of one- and two - phonon states .",
    "the resulting anharmonicities have not been found large , especially in @xmath3pb . in particular , the anharmonicity associated with states whose main component is a double giant resonance has been found of the order of a few hundred @xmath4 .",
    "this is certainly related to the fact that rpa gives a good description of giant resonances , especially in heavy closed shell nuclei .    in metallic clusters , a strongly collective state",
    "is known to exist , the dipole plasmon , which corresponds to the oscillation of the delocalized electrons of the cluster against the positively charged ions . the experimental evidence for states corresponding to the double excitation of the plasmon has not been confirmed @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the situation is also quite unclear . from one hand , in @xcite",
    "a purely harmonic spectrum for the multiple excitation of the plasmon has been predicted . on the other hand , by using the same approach as in @xcite huge anharmonicities in the two - plasmon states have been found @xcite .",
    "an important difference with respect to the case of atomic nuclei is that in metallic clusters the two - body interaction is very long ranged .",
    "this is probably the main reason why the rpa ground state is very different from the hartree - fock one and the rpa backward amplitudes are quite large . of course",
    ", this may cause that the same level of truncation in the boson expansion is not adequate both in the case of nuclei and of metal clusters .    in principle",
    ", configuration mixing calculations can give a clear , model independent , indication on the existence of such two - phonon states and on their degree of anharmonicity .",
    "unfortunately , since the states one looks for are quite high in energy , the number of configurations required to get stable results is huge . in @xcite",
    "such a study has been performed for a very simple case : two interacting electrons moving in a uniform positive charge distribution .",
    "this is a kind of precursor of a metal cluster in the jellium approximation and allows for a numerically exact calculation .",
    "important deviations from the harmonic limit have been found .",
    "more specifically , in addition to an almost perfectly harmonic vibrational band based on the ground state , the other states can be classified in other bands with a much less degree of harmonicity .",
    "aim of this paper is to shed some light on the limits of the approach adopted in @xcite and @xcite by applying it to a 3-level solvable model@xcite .",
    "the analysis we are going to present is very similar to that in @xcite where a 2-level model was considered and the parameters were adjusted in such a way to mimick the multiple excitation of a giant resonance .",
    "the 3-level model is , of course , richer . in particular , since there are two single particle states above the fermi surface ( particle states ) and one below ( hole ) , two different elementary p - h configurations and , correspondingly , two different phonons can be excited .",
    "therefore , one can better simulate the situation encountered in nuclei which generally present one high - lying and one low - lying collective modes for each multipolarity .",
    "also , matrix elements of the interaction connecting a particle - hole state with a two - particle one can be included in a natural way .",
    "these terms are present in a generic two - body interaction and are very important since they couple states having numbers of phonons differing by one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will describe the model and the formalism . in sec .",
    "iii , we will analyse the results . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we will review the content of the paper and draw some conclusions .",
    "the model@xcite consists of three @xmath5-fold degenerate single - particle shells which are occupied by @xmath5 particles . in the absence of interaction , then , the lowest level is completely filled while the others are empty .",
    "this state , the  hartree - fock \" ( hf ) state of the system , is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "a single - particle state is specified by a set of quantum numbers ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 stands for the shell ( @xmath8=0,1,2 ) and @xmath9 specifies the @xmath5 substates within the shell .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion in a state ( @xmath7 ) are defined by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "let us consider the operators @xmath12 these operators satisfy the lie algebra of the group su(3 ) @xmath13=\\delta_{jk}k_{il}-\\delta_{il}k_{kj}. \\label{2}\\ ] ] the hamiltonian of the model is written in terms of the generators @xmath14 only and contains up to two - body interactions .",
    "its form is @xmath15 with real coefficients .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath16 can be constructed either by using the properties of the su(3 ) algebra or by diagonalizing it in the space @xmath17 where @xmath18 are normalization factors .",
    "the mapping procedure to construct boson images of fermion operators is the same discussed in previous works ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , due to the orthonormality of both sets of states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , it is simply based on the requirement that corresponding matrix elements in @xmath24 and @xmath25 be equal",
    ". the procedure is , therefore , of marumori - type .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for more details . here",
    ", we simply say that , in correspondence with the hamiltonian @xmath16 ( [ 3 ] ) , we introduce a hermitian boson hamiltonian @xmath29 which , in the most extended version , has the form @xmath30 with the coefficients depending on the parameters @xmath31 of eq.([3 ] ) .",
    "let us now introduce the operators @xmath32 and let the state @xmath33 satisfy the condition @xmath34 by using the equations of motion method @xcite one finds that the amplitudes x and y are solutions of @xmath35 where @xmath36|\\psi_0 ) , \\label{11}\\ ] ] @xmath37|\\psi_0 ) \\label{12}\\ ] ] and @xmath38 are the energies of the excited states @xmath39 as anticipated in the introduction , the form of eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) is strictly related to the degree of truncation of the boson hamiltonian . in the hypothesis that @xmath29 contains up to two - boson terms , the double commutators in eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) are just numbers which , therefore , are also the values of the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath25 .",
    "this is the simplest case which can be realized in this formalism and represents the boson counterpart of the standard rpa .",
    "this degree of approximation can be improved by introducing a hamiltonian with higher - order terms like , for instance , ( [ 7 ] ) . in this case",
    "the double commutators are operators . in order to calculate their expectation values in @xmath33 , as required in eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 12 ] ) , one can express the @xmath41 and @xmath42 operators in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath44 by reversing eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) ( and its conjugate ) and use the fact that the ground state @xmath33 is defined as the vacuum of the q s",
    ". this procedure gives , however , matrices @xmath40 and @xmath25 which depend on the x and y amplitudes and , consequently , equations of motion ( [ 10 ] ) which are non linear . in what follows this non linear extension of rpa will be called erpa .",
    "having determined the x and y amplitudes within rpa or erpa , one can express the hamiltonian @xmath29 in terms of the operators q and @xmath44 . in the case of rpa , namely when the boson hamiltonian ( [ 7 ] ) is truncated at two - boson terms only , @xmath29 can be rewritten simply as @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the energies solutions of the rpa equations ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "this hamiltonian obviously does nt mix states with different phonon numbers and so its eigenstates are pure zero- , one- , ... , m - phonon states . for a higher - level truncation in the boson hamiltonian , like for instance that of eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath29 acquires instead the more general form @xmath47 ( for simplicity , we have dropped all the indices ) where the @xmath48 coefficients are functions of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "also in this case , as in rpa , the term @xmath51 as well as the non - diagonal terms @xmath52 vanish , as can be easily shown using the fact that the @xmath49 and @xmath50 amplitudes are solutions of the erpa equations ( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "the remaining terms of ( [ 15 ] ) , however , mix states with different phonon numbers so that the eigenstates of the full hamiltonian become combinations of these states .",
    "this fact introduces an evident difference with rpa since the energies which result from the erpa equations are not eigenvalues of the boson hamiltonian in the phonon space as it is in the case of rpa ( where they provide the excitation energies of the one - phonon eigenstates ) . in the next section",
    ", we will show the results obtained by diagonalizing ( [ 15 ] ) in different bases , containing up to two- , three- and four - phonon states , and compare them with the rpa and the exact ones .",
    "let us first of all fix the parameters entering in the hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the energies @xmath53 and @xmath54 have been chosen equal to @xmath55 and 2.5@xmath55 , respectively . in order to simplify the analysis , the coefficients @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 have been assumed independent of the indices @xmath59 and proportional to one parameter , @xmath60 .",
    "more precisely , we have fixed @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 as in ref . @xcite .",
    "both @xmath55 and @xmath60 are parameter expressed in units of energy .",
    "all calculations have been performed for a system of @xmath64 particles .",
    "we begin our analysis by examining the limits of validity of the truncation in the boson hamiltonian ( [ 7 ] ) . to do that we compare the exact spectrum of the fermion hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) with that obtained by diagonalizing @xmath29 ( [ 7 ] ) in the full boson space .",
    "the results are shown in fig",
    ". 1 where we report , as functions of the strength @xmath65 , the energies of those states which , at zero strength , are pure 1p-1h or 2p-2h states . for later use we also label these states with the symbols @xmath66 and @xmath67 meaning by that the states which , in the limit @xmath68 , are the one - phonon @xmath69 and two - phonon @xmath70 states of the rpa formalism .",
    "the eigenvalues of the boson hamiltonian ( dashed lines ) are found in good agreement with the exact ones in the whole range of variation of @xmath71 . in the following",
    "we will take the spectrum of the truncated hamiltonian as the reference one .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the energies resulting from the rpa and erpa equations together with the reference spectrum . for small values of the strength ,",
    "rpa and erpa give almost identical results , in good agreement with the reference ones .",
    "differences become really visible around @xmath72 , where rpa undergoes a collapse . in this region",
    "erpa solutions remain instead stable and close to the reference ones . on the basis of the comments at the end of sec .",
    "ii , however , we notice that these erpa energies can be considered excitation energies of one - phonon states only in the hypothesis that all the terms of ( [ 15 ] ) but @xmath73 and @xmath52 play a minor role .",
    "although not clearly visible at a first glance , the spectrum of fig . 1 shows marked anharmonicities . in order to quantify these , in fig",
    "3 we plot the ratios @xmath74 where by @xmath75 and @xmath76 we mean the exact energies of the states @xmath66 and @xmath77 defined in fig . 1 .",
    "one notices a well different behaviour of the three ratios plotted . in the case of the state",
    "@xmath78 the ratio is seen to grow rapidly for increasing @xmath71 . in the case of the state @xmath79 , @xmath80 remains instead almost exactly zero therefore showing that the corresponding exact state can be fairly well described as a pure two - phonon state .",
    "the remaining `` mixed '' state @xmath81 exhibits only a moderate anharmonicity .",
    "these results resembles that of ref .",
    "@xcite where a realistic two - electron system was examined .",
    "indeed , in both cases , the spectrum is found to exhibit some levels with a clear harmonic nature mixed , however , to other levels which do not display at all this nature .",
    "this mix of states makes of course complicate to provide a clear cut answer to the question of how much harmonic is the spectrum of these many - body systems , the answer strongly depending on which levels one is looking at .    the existence of the anharmonicites evidenced in fig .",
    "3 represents an evident limit to the harmonic picture of rpa and points to the need of diagonalizing the full hamiltonian ( [ 15 ] ) in a multiphonon space in order to reproduce the exact spectrum properly .",
    "we have performed three separate calculations by diagonalizing @xmath29 in spaces including up to two- , three- and four - phonon configurations .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 together with the reference ones .",
    "the internal structure of the collective phonons entering in the basis states is the one obtained in erpa , i.e. the @xmath49 and @xmath50 amplitudes are solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) where the full hamiltonian ( [ 7 ] ) has been used . keeping for simplicity the same labelling of states used in fig . 1",
    ", we can say that , as expected from the previous discussion , for the states @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath79 the results are almost independent of the basis and in very good agreement with the exact ones .",
    "for the state @xmath78 we find instead a marked dependence on the basis , the results approaching more and more the reference ones when the space is enlarged .",
    "going from the smaller space to that including up to three phonons the agreement is quite good for @xmath84 . for a higher strength the space needs to be further enlarged up to four phonons . a somewhat similar behaviour , although less pronounced , is seen for the state @xmath81 .    as a final result , in fig .",
    "5 we show the ground state energies calculated within rpa and as they result by diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( [ 15 ] ) in multiphonon spaces .",
    "all these results are compared with the exact ones and with those obtained by diagonalizing the boson hamiltonian ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to see that the good agreement between fermion and boson results already found in fig . 1 for the excitation energies",
    "is confirmed also in this case .",
    "as expected , rpa overestimates the exact values .",
    "all the diagonalizations in multiphonon spaces lead instead to an underestimation of these values showing , however , a rapid convergence to the exact values with increasing the size of the spaces .",
    "in this paper we have analysed some of the lowest excited states of the spectrum of a solvable 3-level model , namely those that in rpa would be described as one and two - phonon states .",
    "we have worked in a boson formalism . as a preliminary step , then , we have constructed a boson image of the fermion hamiltonian whose expansion has been truncated at four - boson terms .",
    "the procedure followed in such a derivation has been of marumori - type .",
    "the quality of the boson hamiltonian has been tested by comparing its eigenvalues with the exact ones . within the considered range of variation of the interaction strength the agreement between fermion and boson energies has always been found quite good .    by making use of this boson hamiltonian",
    "we have constructed rpa - type equations and solved them iteratively .",
    "the new solutions have gained in stability with respect to the rpa ones and , in particular , around the rpa collapse point the new energies have exhibited a good agreement with the exact ones .",
    "this extension of rpa , while introducing corrections to the pauli principle violations present in rpa , naturally leads to a hamiltonian which mixes states with a different number of phonons .",
    "we have performed diagonalizations in spaces containing up to two- , three- and four - phonon states and observed an improved quality of the approximate spectra with increasing the size of the spaces .",
    "special attention has also been addressed to the problem of the anharmonicity of the spectrum .",
    "this has been found relevant for the state which , in rpa , is described as the double excitation of the lowest one - phonon state . on the contrary , for the other states , a less pronounced anharmonicity has been found .",
    "these findings agree with those of ref .",
    "@xcite and point to the necessity of considering together all the possible elementary excitations of a many - body system when discussing the anharmonicity of its spectrum .",
