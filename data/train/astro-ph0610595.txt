    "in our ongoing araucaria project , we are improving the accuracy of several of the most important stellar distance indicators with the aim to measure the distances to nearby galaxies , out to about 10 mpc , with an accuracy of 3 percent with respect to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "the feasibility to reach this accuracy using a combination of optical and near - infrared photometry of _ cepheid variables _ has already been demonstrated for the local group irregular galaxies ic 1613 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006a ) , ngc 6822",
    "( gieren et al . 2006 ; pietrzyski et al . 2004 ) and ngc 3109 ( pietrzyski et al . 2006b , soszyski et al .",
    "our list of targets also includes four of the five principal late - type galaxies in the loose neighboring group of galaxies in sculptor . for ngc 300 , a near face - on spiral member of the sculptor group at a distance of 1.88 mpc",
    ", we were able to achieve the same 3 percent accuracy for its distance determination from the cepheid approach ( gieren et al .",
    "for all these galaxies so far studied in the araucaria project , we found clear evidence for the existence of substantial intrinsic dust absorption , in addition to the foreground absorption produced inside the milky way .",
    "this result underlines the importance to use infrared data to obtain the most reliable distance estimates , eliminating intrinsic reddening as the dominating source of systematic error in optical photometric studies .",
    "our previous studies also show that in the case of cepheids , the reddening - independent _ wesenheit index _ is able to provide a distance result which is much less affected by reddening than the distance estimates in the v and i bands , provided excellent optical light curves of the variables are available . a cepheid distance derived from the ( v -",
    "i ) wesenheit index ( for a definition see our previous papers cited above ) is therefore a good approximation to the more accurate distance which can be obtained from near - infrared data , and allows an important consistency check on the distance result for a given galaxy from infrared photometry of its cepheid variables .",
    "ngc 55 , our target galaxy studied in this paper , is a highly inclined late - type galaxy classified as sb(s)m in the nasa extragalactic database .",
    "although its high inclination makes it difficult to study its morphology , ngc 55 resembles to some extent the lmc but is more massive . from color images as the one shown in gieren et al .",
    "( 2005b ) , it is evident that ngc 55 contains an abundant population of young blue stars and should therefore contain a sizable population of cepheids , which have so far not been searched for in this galaxy .",
    "the few previous distance determinations which have been attempted for ngc 55 have yielded an unsatisfactorily large range , from 1.34 mpc from carbon stars ( pritchet et al .",
    "1987 ) to 2.3 mpc from planetary nebulae ( van de steene et al .",
    "2006 ) . in between",
    "falls the determination of 1.8 mpc obtained by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who used the tully - fisher relation , tied to distances of other dwarf galaxies in the sculptor group measured with the tip of the red giant branch method .",
    "all these distance determinations are likely to be plagued by rather large systematic uncertainties . for instance , the recent determination of van de steene et al .",
    "( 2006 ) from the pnlf method depends rather sensitively on the assumed oxygen abundance of the planetary nebulae in ngc 55 used in the construction of the luminosity function , which is quite uncertain at the present time ( e.g. tuellmann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the detection of a sizable population of cepheid variables in ngc 55 has therefore a strong potential to improve the situation and provide a more accurate distance determination for this galaxy which we need in the context of the principal science goal of the araucaria project , viz . to determine the effect of metallicity on the physical parameters used as a distance indicator for the different stellar standard candles we study .",
    "we remark here that we are obtaining , in a parallel effort , chemical abundances for oxygen and some other elements from the spectra of a large number of blue supergiant stars in ngc 55 which we have obtained with the eso vlt . these abundances will not only provide a mean metallicity for ngc 55 but also allow to determine the abundance _",
    "gradient _ in its disk if existent , as we were able to do in the case of ngc 300 ( urbaneja et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the results of an extensive wide - field imaging survey for cepheid variables in ngc 55 which we conducted in 2002 and 2003 at the warsaw 1.3-m telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "as we will show in the following sections , we have discovered a surprisingly large population of long - period cepheids in this galaxy .",
    "we will describe our observations , data reductions and calibrations in section 2 , and will present the catalog of photometric properties of the cepheid variables in ngc 55 in section 3 . in section 4 we will determine the period - luminosity relations in the v , i and wesenheit bands from our data and provide a new distance determination to ngc 55 .",
    "we will discuss our results in section 5 , and summarize our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "all the data presented in this paper were collected with the warsaw 1.3-m telescope at las campanas observatory .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a mosaic 8k @xmath1 8k detector , with a field of view of about 35 @xmath1 35 arcmin and a scale of about 0.25 arcsec / pix . for more instrumental details on this camera ,",
    "the reader is referred to the ogle website : _",
    "http://ogle.astrouw.edu.pl/~ogle / index.html_. v and i band images of ngc 55 were secured during 77 different nights .",
    "the exposure time was set to 900 seconds in both filters .",
    "most of the observations were obtained in 2002 between july 3 and november 21 .",
    "additional observations were made during three photometric nights in may 2003 in order to accurately calibrate the data and improve the periods of the detected variable stars .",
    "preliminary reductions ( i.e. debiasing and flatfielding ) were done with the iraf package .",
    "then , the psf photometry was obtained for all stars in the same manner as in pietrzyski , gieren and udalski ( 2002 ) .",
    "independently , the data were reduced with the ogle iii pipeline based on the image subtraction technique ( udalski 2003 ; woniak 2000 ) .    in order to calibrate our photometry onto the standard system",
    "our target was monitored during three photometric nights ( 2003 may 11 , 17 and 28 ) together with some 25 standard stars from the landolt fields spanning a wide range of colors ( -0.14 @xmath2 v - i @xmath2 1.43 ) , and observed at very different airmasses . since in principle",
    "the transformation equations for each of the eight chips may have different color coefficients and zero points , the selected sample of standard stars was observed on each of the individuial chips , and transformation coefficients were derived independently for each chip , on each night .",
    "comparison of the photometry obtained on the different nights revealed that the internal accuracy of zero points in both v and i bands is better than 0.02 mag .    to correct the variation of the zero points in v and i over the mosaic , the `` correction maps '' established by pietrzyski et al .",
    "( 2004 ) were used .",
    "these maps were already applied to correct photometry obtained in the field of ngc 6822 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2004 ) and ngc 3109 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2006b ) with the same camera . comparison with other studies revealed that these maps allow to correct for the zero point variations across the mosaic field in a way that the residuals do not exceed 0.02 - 0.03 mag .",
    "two fields in the smc which contain a huge number of uniformly distributed stars with very accurate photometry established by the ogle team ( udalski et al .",
    "1999 ) were monitored on all three nights together with our target and standard fields , and were calibrated in the same manner as the ngc 55 observations .",
    "comparison of ogle ii and our photometry shows that on average the difference in the zero points between these two photometric sets is smaller than 0.02 mag on each chip .",
    "alcaino and liller ( 1983 ) established a sequence of secondary standards in the field of ngc 55 . in our database 7 stars",
    "were found to be common to this sequence ( e.g. the remaining ones were either saturated or located outside our field of view ) .",
    "the comparison of our v band photometry for these objects with that of alcaino and liller , which is presented in table 1 , demonstrates that the zero points of the two datasets agree to within 0.02 mag .    summarizing the previous discussion",
    ", we may conclude that all internal and external checks we made indicate that the zero points of our data are accurate to 0.02 mag in both v and i , and that their possible variations over the mosaic fields are smaller than 0.02 mag .",
    "all stars with photometry in ngc 55 were searched for photometric variations with periods between 0.2 and 200 days , using the analysis of variance algorithm ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) . in order to distinguish cepheids from other types of variable stars",
    ", we used the same criteria given in our initial paper reporting on the discovery of cepheids in ngc 300 ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "the light curves of all cepheid candidates were approximated by fourier series of order 4 .",
    "we then rejected those objects with v amplitudes smaller than 0.4 mag , the approximate lower limit amplitude for classical cepheids .",
    "this procedure also helps in screening our cepheid sample from the inclusion of strongly blended objects . for",
    "the variable stars passing our selection criteria , mean v and i magnitudes were derived by integrating their light curves which had been previously converted onto an intensity scale , and converting the results back to the magnitude scale . because of the very good quality and phase coverage of the light curves , the statistical accuracy of the derived mean magnitudes was typically 0.01 mag for the brighter variables , increasing to about 0.03 mag for the faintest cepheids in our catalog .",
    "we ended up with a list of 143 bona fide classical cepheids with periods between 175.9 and 5.6 days .",
    "the number of long - period cepheids in ngc 55 is surprisingly large , with 133 of the detected cepheids having periods longer than 10 days .",
    "this makes ngc 55 even richer in its long - period cepheid population than ngc 300 , the other sculptor galaxy we had previously surveyed for cepheids ( gieren et al . 2004 ) .",
    "there is certainly a note of caution as to the true cepheid nature of the 3 objects with periods in excess of 100 days ; the time baseline of our photometry is possibly too short to establish their cepheid character beyond any doubt .",
    "future observations will clarify this question .",
    "for this reason , we will exclude these variables in our distance determination in the next section , as we did in the case of the local group galaxy ngc 6822 in which we had also found a number of very long - period cepheid - like variables ( gieren et al .",
    "2006 ; mennickent et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "table 2 gives the individual photometric v and i observations for all cepheid variables we found in ngc 55 .",
    "the full table 2 is available in electronic form . in table 3",
    ", we present their identifications , equatorial coordinates , periods , times of maximum brightness in v , and their mean intensity magnitudes in the v , i and w bands .",
    "the accuracy of the periods is typically about @xmath3 days , good enough to be no significant source of error in the construction of the period - luminosity relations discussed in the next section .    in fig . 1",
    ", we show a mosaic image of ngc 55 from our data with the positions of the detected cepheids overplotted .",
    "2 presents light curves for some of the cepheids which are representative in quality for other variables in our catalog of similar periods , showing that the mean magnitudes of the cepheids can indeed be derived quite accurately from our data even for the shortest - period and faintest cepheids in our sample . in fig .",
    "3 we show the locations of the cepheids in the v , v - i color - magnitude diagram for ngc 55 which we have constructed from our data .",
    "the diagram shows that the cepheids indeed do fill the expected zone in the cmd delineating the cepheid instability strip , presenting supporting evidence that our classification of the objects in table 3 as cepheids seems correct in all cases .",
    "although a more accurate distance to ngc 55 will be derived once near - infrared follow - up photometry will become available for a substantial subsample of the cepheids in our catalog , we can already clearly improve on the existing distance determinations for ngc 55 with the optical cepheid photometric data we have provided in this paper . in figs . 4 - 6 , we show the period - luminosity ( pl ) diagrams obtained from the data in our cepheid catalog for the 130 stars with periods in the range from 10 - 100 days .",
    "pl relations are plotted for the v , i and w magnitudes , where the ( v - i ) wesenheit magnitude is defined in its usual way ( see previous papers in the araucaria project ) .",
    "the pl relation in v is well defined although with somewhat larger scatter than in the case of ngc 300 at a similar distance ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "2002 ; gieren et al . 2004 ) .",
    "this is likely due to an increased size of differential reddening in ngc 55 due to its high inclination with respect to the line of sight , as compared to ngc 300 which is oriented almost face - on . as expected if differential reddening indeed causes much of the scatter in fig .",
    "4 , the i - band pl relation in fig . 5",
    "has a clearly smaller dispersion . while it should be expected that the w - band pl relation has an even smaller dispersion due to its expected insensitivity to reddening , fig .",
    "6 shows that this is not the case and that the dispersion is instead rather similar to the one in the v - band pl relation .",
    "this is probably because the photometric accuracy of the data especially for the shorter - period cepheids is not quite as high as needed for the w - band technique to show its full power .",
    "it is also possible that crowding and blending of the cepheids with bright unresolved companion stars in this high - inclination galaxy is a more significant problem than in the other galaxies we have studied so far , invalidating the power of the wesenheit approach to some extent .",
    "this has to be kept in mind when discussing the accuracy of our present distance determination .    in order to obtain the distance to ngc 55 ,",
    "we have carried out least - squares fits to a line to the various pl diagrams .",
    "these free fits yield the following slopes for the pl relations : -2.31 @xmath0 0.18 , -2.56 @xmath0 0.12 and -2.85 @xmath0 0.20 in v , i and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these slope values are somewhat shallower than the corresponding slopes for the lmc cepheid sample studied by the ogle project , but they are still consistent with the ogle lmc pl relation slopes of -2.775 in v , -2.977 in i and -3.300 in @xmath4 ( udalski 2000 ) at the level of 2 @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore keep our standard procedure adopted in our previous papers in this series to use the ogle lmc slopes to derive the distance of our target galaxies relative to the lmc . forcing the slopes to the respective ogle values",
    "leads to the following equations for the ngc 55 cepheid pl relations : + v = -2.775 log p + ( 25.401 @xmath0 0.038 ) mag + i = -2.977 log p + ( 24.778 @xmath0 0.026 ) mag + @xmath6 = -3.300 log p + ( 23.765 @xmath0 0.045 ) mag + adopting 18.50 mag for the lmc distance modulus as we did in our previous papers , and using e(b - v ) = 0.014 mag as the foreground reddening towards ngc 55 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) together with the reddening law of the same authors ( @xmath7 = 3.24 e(b - v ) , @xmath8 = 1.96 e(b - v ) ) , we obtain the following distance moduli for ngc 55 from the three different bands : + @xmath9 ( @xmath6 ) = 26.40 @xmath0 0.05 mag + @xmath9 ( i ) = 26.66 @xmath0 0.03",
    "mag + @xmath9 ( v ) = 26.79 @xmath0 0.04 mag + these values show the same tendency of increasing distance moduli towards the bands with the higher reddening sensitivity that we have seen for the other galaxies previously studied in this series , suggesting the existence of significant internal reddening in ngc 55 in addition to the foreground reddening produced in the milky way .",
    "this is of course no surprise because high - resolution images of ngc 55 clearly reveal the existence of significant dust absorption in the regions where the young , blue stars are concentrated . since the difference of the distance moduli in v and i above is identical to the reddening e(v - i ) , we obtain from our data e(v - i ) = 26.79 - 26.66 = 0.13 mag .",
    "with e(b - v ) = e(v - i)/1.28 , this translates in a ( b - v ) color excess of e(b - v ) = 0.102 mag , which then leads to an extinction - corrected true distance modulus of @xmath9 = 26.46 mag .",
    "this value agrees within the combined 1 @xmath5 uncertainty with the true distance modulus derived from the wesenheit index .",
    "unless follow - up near - infrared data for the cepheids in ngc 55 become available which will allow a more accurate determination of the mean reddening of the cepheids due to the longer wavelength baseline , we will adopt , as our current best value from optical vi photometry , 26.40 mag as the true distance modulus of ngc 55 .",
    "our adopted distance to ngc 55 from optical photometry in the v and i bands of 130 long - period cepheid variables discovered in the present survey is 26.40 mag , corresponding to 1.91 mpc .",
    "this value is practically identical to the distance of ngc 300 of ( 1.88 @xmath0 0.06 ) mpc ( gieren et al .",
    "2005a ) , strongly supporting the idea that ngc 300 and ngc 55 form a gravitationally bound system as previously suggested by whiting ( 1999 ) , and others . the intrinsic uncertainty of the distance modulus of ngc 55 derived from the ( v - i ) wesenheit index is @xmath0 0.05 mag , and is basically determined by the accuracy of our photometry .",
    "there are additional sources of systematic error which may affect this result .",
    "one of them is the effect of blending of some cepheids in our sample with relatively bright stars , too close to the cepheids to be resolved in our images . in a previous study of ngc 300 in which we could compare ground - based photometry of a large number of cepheids to bvi photometry of the same variables obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( bresolin et al . 2005 ) , we were able to show that the effect blending with unresolved bright stars has on the distance modulus derived from the ground - based images is less than 0.04 mag .",
    "we think that the effect of blending on our present distance result for ngc 55 should be of the same order given that the galaxy has the same distance as ngc 300 , and the resolution of our ngc 55 images is very similar to the one of the images we used in our distance work for ngc 300 .",
    "the higher inclination of ngc 55 with respect to the line of sight however might render the effect due to blending somewhat more severe , as possibly indicated by the slightly enhanced dispersion of the v - band pl relation for ngc 55 ( fig .",
    "4 ) as compared to ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "we estimate that blending with unresolved bright companion stars might introduce a systematic uncertainty of @xmath0 0.07 mag , in the case of ngc 55 .",
    "another possible source of systematic uncertainty on our distance result is the slopes of the fiducial lmc cepheid pl relations which we have adopted from the extensive work of the ogle project ( udalski 2000 ) .",
    "recent work by ngeow and kanbur ( 2006 ; see also references given therein ) suggest that the lmc cepheid pl relations in v and i are likely to show significant breaks at a period close to 10 days , leading to slightly different slopes of the pl relations valid for periods shorter , and longer than 10 days .",
    "the effect is very subtle and according to ngeow and kanbur ( 2006 ) affects distance moduli determined from the v and i pl relations by less than 0.03 mag .",
    "we will assume here that the systematic uncertainty of our ngc 55 distance modulus due to the uncertain slope of the fiducial pl relation in the lmc is @xmath0 0.03 mag .",
    "another effect which might systematically affect our distance result is the possible metallicity dependence of the cepheid pl relation .",
    "if such an effect is significant , the use of a pl relation calibrated for lmc metallicity for a cepheid population whose metallicity is quite different from the lmc cepheids would systematically affect the distance result .",
    "a number of recent theoretical and empirical studies have tried to trace down the effect of cepheid metal abundances on their absolute magnitudes in different wavelength ranges ( e.g. storm et al .",
    "2004 ; saha et al .",
    "2006 ) , but unfortunately so far no clear - cut and accurate results have been obtained .",
    "a thorough discussion of the metallicity effect on the cepheid pl relation has very recently been given by mottini et al .",
    "their own results obtained from relating the pl relation residuals for individual cepheids to their metallicities measured from high - resolution spectra are consistent with a null effect of cepheid iron abundance on the pl relation zero points in both the optical v and the near - infrared k band .",
    "it is clear , however , that further work on this very important question is needed which will eventually provide more accurate results than all previous work published over the past years .",
    "this is one of the principal goals of our araucaria project .",
    "what can be said at the present time is that from the results published over the past 8 years ( see mottini et al .",
    "2006 ) it appears that the metallicity effect is small , not exceeding a few percent in any of the standard optical and near - ir photometric bands .",
    "this seems true both for the pl relation zero points ( pietrzynski and gieren 2006 ) , and for their slopes in different bands ( e.g. gieren et al .",
    "we adopt @xmath0 0.04 mag as an additional systematic uncertainty on our present distance modulus for ngc 55 from the metallicity effect .    probably the largest systematic uncertainty on our present distance result for ngc 55",
    "is the size of the reddening intrinsic ngc 55 which affects our cepheid sample . the use of the wesenheit index in this paper , and the consistency of the distance moduli from v , i and w using the reddening value derived from our data makes us expect that the effect of the uncertain intrinsic reddening on our adopted distance modulus is not larger than a few percent , however .",
    "it is clear that our planned follow - up distance determination for ngc 55 from accurate near - infrared photometry of a significant subsample of the cepheids in our catalog will eliminate reddening as a significant source of error , as we could demonstrate in our previous cepheid near - infrared studies in the araucaria project , and allow us to reduce the total systematic uncertainty on the distance of ngc 55 to a figure close to 3% . moving our distance work to the near - infrared",
    "will also reduce the effect of blending because most stars which are bright enough to contaminate the fluxes of cepheid variables at a significant level , including the secondary components in cepheid binary systems , are expected to be blue stars which affect the cepheid fluxes in optical bands more strongly than in the near - infrared ( e.g. gieren 1982 ; szabados 1996 ) .    summarizing this discussion",
    ", we estimate that the total systematic uncertainty on our current distance modulus for ngc 55 from the various factors we have discussed is in the order of @xmath0 0.09 mag .",
    "our adopted true distance modulus to ngc 55 is therefore 26.40 mag @xmath0 0.05 mag ( internal error ) @xmath0 0.09 mag ( systematic error ) .",
    "we note that this result is tied to an _ assumed _ distance modulus of 18.50 of the lmc and does not include the current uncertainty on the lmc distance , which is probably in the order of @xmath0 0.10 mag as well .",
    "since all the distances we are obtaining in the araucaria project are tied to the same assumed lmc distance of 18.50 mag , however , the _ relative _ distances between our target galaxies are not affected .",
    "we have carried out an extensive search for cepheid variables in ngc 55 which has resulted in the discovery of 143 bona fide cepheids .",
    "we provide the periods of these objects and their mean magnitudes in the optical v and i bands , as well as their accurate positions . from 130 of these variables with periods between 10 and 100",
    "days we obtain the period - luminosity relations in v and i , and for the reddening - independent ( v - i ) wesenheit index .",
    "the distance moduli derived from these data demonstrate that apart from the very small foreground reddening , there is significant additional reddening which is produced inside ngc 55 , which we determine as e(b - v ) = 0.102 mag from our data .",
    "our best adopted value for the distance modulus of ngc 55 from optical photometry of its large population of cepheid variables is 26.40 mag @xmath0 0.05 mag ( intrinsic ) @xmath0 0.09 mag ( systematic ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty includes the estimated contributions from the effect of metallicity on the pl relation , the current uncertainty on the slope of the fiducial lmc cepheid pl relation we have used in our distance determination , the effect of blending of the cepheids in our sample with bright companion stars which are not resolved in our images , accuracy of the photometric zero points , and of dust absorption internal to ngc 55 affecting the optical cepheid magnitudes . as in the previous papers of the araucaria project ,",
    "our adopted distance modulus of our present target galaxy is tied to an assumed lmc true distance modulus of 18.50 .",
    "our estimated 0.09 mag systematic uncertainty of the distance modulus of ngc 55 does not contain the additional systematic uncertainty of the adopted value of the lmc distance .    the cepheid distance derived in this paper for ngc 55 is more accurate than the other distance determinations for this nearby galaxy available in the literature which we discussed in the introduction of this paper . in the near future , we expect to improve the accuracy of the distance determination to ngc 55 even further through near - ir photometry of a subsample of the cepheids in our catalog , which will reduce the current uncertainties in our optical study due to reddening and blending .    within the errors , the distance to ngc 55 from its cepheid variables is _ identical _ to the cepheid distance of 1.88 mpc to ngc 300 ( gieren et al .",
    "2005a ) which is located close to ngc 55 in the sky .",
    "this strengthens the case for a physical association of ngc 55 and ngc 300 , as previously suggested by a number of authors .",
