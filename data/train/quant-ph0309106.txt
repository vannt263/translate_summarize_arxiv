    "recent progress in quantum control of atoms , ions , and photons has spurred interest in developing architectures for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "an intriguing question is whether similar techniques can be extended to control quantum properties of `` artificial atoms '' in a condensed matter environment .",
    "these tiny solid state devices , e.g. flux lines threading a superconducting loop , charges in cooper pair boxes , and single electron spins , exhibit quantum mechanical properties which can be manipulated by external currents and voltages @xcite . to realize their potential as highly tunable qubits",
    ", they must interact at a rate faster than the decoherence caused by the complex and noisy environment they inhabit .",
    "strong coupling between qubits is therefore essential to achieve a high degree of control over quantum dynamics . for most systems",
    "a mechanism achieving the required coupling strength has only been proposed for nearby qubits @xcite , thus limiting the spatial extent of controllable interactions .",
    "we describe a technique for coupling mesoscopic systems that can be millimeters apart . in our proposal ,",
    "a strong interaction is obtained by linking charge qubits to quantized voltage oscillations in a transmission line resonator .",
    "we show that the capacitive coupling between charge degrees of freedom of the mesoscopic system and the superconducting resonator is formally analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "such an interaction may be used for controllable coupling of distant mesoscopic qubits , thereby facilitating scalable quantum computing architectures .",
    "furthermore , we have recently shown @xcite that by combining the present approach with atom trapping above the resonator , these techniques may allow coupling between solid state and atomic qubits , thus opening a new avenue for quantum information research .",
    "these new opportunities for qubit manipulation using microwave photons are made possible by the excellent coherence properties of high quality factor superconducting microstrip resonators originally developed for photon detection @xcite .",
    "with observed q - factors exceeding @xmath0 at 10 ghz , such resonators could permit on - chip storage of a microwave photon for more than @xmath1s .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the microwave cavities used in atomic cavity qed @xcite , these 1d transmission line resonators have mode volumes far smaller than a cubic wavelength , allowing a significantly stronger coupling to resonator modes . this combination of long coherence time and strong coupling makes microstrip resonators a promising technology for quantum manipulation .",
    "in this paper we outline several intriguing avenues for applications of these resonators in the context of quantum dot research .",
    "we first discuss a mechanism for strong coupling between spacially separated charge states in a mesoscopic system .",
    "we show in particular that the use of quantum dots may allow construction of novel quantum devices such as an on - chip double - dot microscopic maser @xcite .",
    "our discussion pertains to lithographically defined lateral double quantum dots @xcite , although the resonator coupling mechanism would apply equally to other mesoscopic systems .",
    "indeed , similar ideas for resonator mediated interactions have been developed in the context of superconducting qubits @xcite .",
    "specifically , the strong - coupling mechanism analogous to that presented here has been proposed independently in @xcite .",
    "although coherence properties of charge states in quantum dots are likely worse than those of superconducting systems , quantum dots have two potential advantages : they are highly tunable , and the electrons they confine are not paired , allowing access to the electron spin . we show that the more stable spin degree of freedom may be accessed using techniques for quantum coherent manipulation initially developed in atomic physics @xcite . in analogy to the use of raman transitions in cavity quantum electrodynamics ,",
    "the electron spin states can be coupled via a virtual charge state transition .",
    "since the spin decoherence rate is far slower than the charge decoherence rate , the losses can thereby be greatly reduced .",
    "finally , we explicitly address the effect of the resonator on radiative contributions to qubit decoherence , and demonstrate that the latter can be greatly suppressed .    before proceeding",
    ", we also note important earlier work on cavity quantum electrodynamics with quantum dots in the optical regime @xcite , which differs qualitatively from the ideas discussed here .",
    "we consider a single electron shared between two adjacent quantum dots whose energy eigenstates are tuned close to resonance with the fundamental mode of a nearby superconducting transmission line segment .",
    "the electron can occupy the left or right dot , states @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively , and it tunnels between the dots at rate @xmath4 ( see figure  [ interdot ] ) . a capacitive coupling @xmath5 between the right dot and the resonator causes the electron charge state to interact with excitations in the transmission line .",
    "we assume that the dot is much smaller than the wavelength of the resonator excitation , so the interaction strength may be derived from the electrostatic potential energy of the system , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the voltage on the resonator near the right dot , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the capacitance to ground of the right dot .",
    "a more useful form of the interaction hamiltonian is found by rewriting this energy in a different basis .",
    "first , we express the left and right dot states @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the double dot eigenstates .",
    "if the two dots are tunnel coupled with matrix element @xmath4 and have a potential energy difference of @xmath11 , then the double dot eigenstates are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the splitting in frequency between the eigenstates @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for notational simplicity",
    ", we represent the electron charge state in terms of pauli spin matrices by defining raising and lowering operators @xmath16 , so that @xmath17 , and so on .",
    "next , we express the voltage as an operator . a transmission line segment of length @xmath18 , capacitance per unit length @xmath19 and characteristic impedance @xmath20 has allowed wavevectors @xmath21 and frequencies @xmath22 .",
    "canonical quantization of the transmission line hamiltonian allows the voltage to be written in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath23 for the modes @xmath24 of the resonator .",
    "these excitations may be interpreted as microwave photons . with substitution of the quantized voltage at the end of the resonator ,",
    "@xmath25 the full hamiltonian becomes @xmath26 the coupling constants , @xmath27 and @xmath28 scale as an overall coupling strength @xmath29 where @xmath30 kohm is the resistance quantum .",
    "for @xmath31 ( which is guaranteed for low - impedance resonators @xmath32 ) the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ sb ] ) may be further simplified by neglecting all terms which do not conserve energy : if the dot is near resonance with the fundamental frequency , @xmath33 , we may neglect all other modes , and in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath34    the jaynes - cummings interaction described by eq .",
    "( [ jc ] ) furnishes a direct analogy to a two - level atom coupled to a single mode field .",
    "a novel feature of the double dot system is that the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be adjusted on fast time scales by varying the voltage applied to the metallic gates defining the quantum dots .",
    "consequently the detuning @xmath37 and the effective coupling constants @xmath38 may be controlled independently for double dots on either end of the resonator , each of which interacts with the resonator via the coupling described by eq .",
    "( [ jc ] ) .    to illustrate the strength of the resonator mediated interaction rate @xmath39",
    ", we compare it with a static interaction achieved by capacitively coupling spatially separated double dots through a conductor . by calculating the change in electrostatic energy of an electron in one double dot due to shifting the electron between dots in the second double dot ,",
    "we find that the electrostatic interaction energy is @xmath40 .",
    "if the nonresonant conductor and the transmission line have the same length @xmath18 and capacitance to ground @xmath19 , the two interaction rates may be compared directly : @xmath41 typically , @xmath42 and careful fabrication permits a strong coupling capacitance , with @xmath43 @xcite , so that @xmath44 . hence a much stronger coupling can be achieved using the resonant interaction .",
    "for example , a wavelength @xmath45 mm in gaas corresponds to a frequency of @xmath46 ghz , yielding an extremely large coupling constant @xmath47 .    in atomic systems ,",
    "the photon decay rate @xmath48 often limits coherent control . in the solid state",
    ", superconducting transmission line resonators developed for high speed circuitry and photon detection have been produced with q - factors up to @xmath0 @xcite ; the photon decay rate @xmath49 can thus be very small .",
    "the limiting factor is the charge state dephasing rate @xmath50 .",
    "inelastic transition rates @xcite set a lower bound of a few hundred mhz , and initial observations of coherent charge oscillations reveal a dephasing time near 1 ns , limited by relatively hot ( 100 mk ) electron temperatures @xcite . for our calculations , we make the conservative estimate @xmath51 ns , noting that the zero temperature value could be an order of magnitude slower .",
    "regardless of the precise dephasing rate , quantum dot charge states would make rather poor qubits .",
    "consequently for application to quantum information we must extend the strong charge state coupling to the spin degree of freedom , which decoheres on much longer timescales .",
    "nevertheless , initial demonstrations of cavity quantum electrodynamics may be possible using only the charge states . stimulated emission of photons by a double quantum dot",
    "has previously been observed using external microwave radiation to enhance tunneling rates @xcite .",
    "if the external source is replaced by the intracavity field of a microwave resonator , stimulated emission can exponentially amplify the field .",
    "for large enough coupling @xmath52 , the double dot can potentially act as an on - chip maser .",
    "a double dot operated in the high - bias regime ( see figure  [ setup ] ) can convert electronic potential energy to microwave photons . by pumping electrons through the double dot , one might hope to induce a population inversion to amplify an applied microwave excitation .",
    "note that such a device is based on a single emitter , and thus may have properties that differ significantly from those of conventional masers .",
    "in fact , the double dot device corresponds to a direct analogue of the microscopic maser ( micro - maser ) that has been extensively studied in atomic physics @xcite .",
    "the micro - maser can be used for unique studies of quantum phenomena including generation of non - classical radiation fields and their non - trivial dynamics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will be interested only in the general feasibility of the on - chip micro - maser , and thus we analyze it semiclassically within a rate equation approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "effects associated with quantum statistics of the generated field are disregarded .",
    "such analysis does however provide a reasonable estimate for the threshold condition and general power .",
    "the double dot system under consideration has left and right barriers which allow tunneling from the source and to the drain with strength @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively , and one of the dots is capacitively coupled to a resonator as in figure  [ interdot ] . by maintaining a potential energy difference between the two leads",
    ", a current is driven through the double dot , and each electron passing through the dot can stimulate emission of a photon into the resonator . to operate as a maser , however , the double dot must exhibit population inversion , which can only be achieved if electrons preferentially flow in through the excited state and leave via the ground state .",
    "since finite tunnel coupling @xmath55 is required in order to emit photons into the resonator , both the excited and ground states @xmath56 must be partially delocalized .",
    "this allows electrons to tunnel directly from the source to the ground state and vice versa .",
    "moreover inelastic decay processes limit how effectively the double dot can convert population inversion into photons . a careful treatment of pumping and decay rates is therefore needed to demonstrate maser action .    .",
    "electrons tunnel from the source into the left dot at rate @xmath53 and from the right dot to the drain at rate @xmath54 . for a finite detuning @xmath11",
    ", this pumping can lead to a population inversion .",
    "decay from the excited @xmath14 state to the ground @xmath15 state occurs via photon emission into the resonator and also via phonon - mediated inelastic decay processes.__,width=336 ]    our semiclassical analysis treats the double dot quantum mechanically , but assumes that the resonator excitations can be described by a coherent state .",
    "we use the density matrix formalism in the rotating wave approximation to derive equations governing the behavior of a double dot coupled to a coherent state of the resonator @xmath57 . from eq .",
    "( [ jc ] ) , one can show that the slowly varying components of the density matrix @xmath58 in the eigenbasis @xmath59 evolve as @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "in addition to this coherent evolution , the density matrix components are affected by dephasing , decay , and coupling to the leads .",
    "in particular , the excited state population @xmath64 increases at a rate @xmath65 due to pumping from the source , while it decays at rate @xmath66 due to relaxation to the ground state at rate @xmath67 and loss to the drain .",
    "similarly , the ground state population @xmath68 increases at a rate @xmath69 , while losing population at rate @xmath70 .",
    "note that our density matrix no longer satisfies @xmath71 ( since the electron can leave the double dot ) , and we have accounted for the large charging energy by allowing at most one electron to inhabit the double dot @xcite .",
    "the pumping and decay rates also contribute to reduction of the off - diagonal terms @xmath72 .",
    "inelastic decay contributes @xmath73 to the charge dephasing rate @xmath50 .",
    "the coupling to the leads , however , enters in an asymmetric fashion because @xmath54 causes direct lifetime broadening , whereas @xmath53 only affects dephasing through virtual processes which allow the confined electron to scatter off electrons in the source .",
    "we consider the regime @xmath74 , where these higher order processes can be neglected in comparison to lifetime broadening , and thereby find that the off - diagonal terms decay at a rate @xmath75 .",
    "taking all terms into account , the density matrix equations of motion are : @xmath76 where @xmath63 . in the steady state , the time derivatives vanish , and one may easily obtain the polarization @xmath77 $ ] and population inversion @xmath78 .",
    "simulated emission processes increase the intracavity field .",
    "the amplitude of the coherent state , @xmath79 , grows as @xmath80 $ ] while decaying at rate @xmath81 due to the finite linewidth of the resonator .",
    "expressed in terms of the effective emission rate , @xmath82 , the field growth rate is @xmath83 . substituting the steady state population inversion , we find the evolution equation for the microwave field : @xmath84 this expression allows derivation of the threshold condition for maser operation , which corresponds to the requirement that the initial growth rate be greater than zero @xmath85 .",
    "due to saturation effects from the @xmath86 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ alph ] ) , the field @xmath79 grows until @xmath87 .",
    "this steady state solution @xmath88 determines the number of generated photons , @xmath89 , which we identify as the double dot maser figure of merit because it quantifies the amplitude of the microwave field attained in the resonator .",
    "required for maser operation is shown as a function of dot - resonator coupling strength for three values of @xmath48 , the rate at which photons leak out of the resonator .",
    "b ) the maximum number of photons produced in the resonator as a function of the pumping current @xmath90 shows saturation due to @xmath91-induced dephasing . note that the required coupling strength is low : @xmath92 mhz .",
    "the relevant parameters for these calculations are : @xmath93 , @xmath94 ns , @xmath95 ns , and in part b ) @xmath96s.__,width=3 ]    the double dot maser can not be made arbitrarily powerful by increasing the pumping power .",
    "although increasing @xmath97 pumps more electrons through the double dot , opening up conduction to the leads speeds up the dephasing rate , which decreases the effective emission rate @xmath98 . consequently there is an optimal pumping rate which maximizes the steady state intracavity field .    to demonstrate the feasibility of building a double dot maser",
    ", we calculate the threshold current and maximum field @xmath89 for a realistic set of parameters ( see figure  [ maser ] ) .",
    "the threshold condition @xmath99 can be satisfied even for a dot - resonator coupling rate of only @xmath100 mhz . for the calculations shown in figure  [ maser ] ,",
    "we take @xmath93 , and moderate values of @xmath91 and @xmath52 yield typical resonator excitations of @xmath101 photons . a weak coupling to a nearby transmission line can leak these excitations at a rate @xmath102s without significantly affecting the q of the resonator , allowing emission of around @xmath103 photons per second .",
    "the resulting power at @xmath104 ghz is around 20 fw .",
    "although these fields are small , they could be detected by photon - assisted tunneling in another mesoscopic two - level system .",
    "for example , recent experiments on a superconductor - insulator - superconductor junction have shown a sub - fw sensitivity to microwave excitations at 25 ghz @xcite . in conjunction with such sensitive microwave detectors ,",
    "this on - chip coherent microwave source could provide a useful tool for high frequency spectroscopy of mesoscopic systems .",
    "the spin state of an electron in a quantum dot has been suggested as a potential solid state qubit because it possesses good coherence properties @xcite . while a quantitative value for the spin dephasing rate @xmath105 is unknown , a number of experiments",
    "indicate that it is significantly smaller than the charge dephasing rate .",
    "experiments in bulk 2deg find @xmath106ns @xcite , though the situation will be different for confined electrons .",
    "spin relaxation times of over 50 @xmath107s @xcite indicate that the spin of an electron in a quantum dot can be well protected from its environment",
    ".    the spin does not couple directly to electromagnetic excitations in a resonator , but an indirect interaction is possible by entangling spin with charge .",
    "this technique is similar to raman transitions in atomic systems , where long - lived hyperfine states interact via an intermediate short - lived excited state . in particular , by employing the analogue of a raman transition , which only virtually populates charge state superpositions , we show below that quantum information can be transferred between the stable spin and photon states .",
    "a technique based on raman transitions requires a closed three level system incorporating both the charge and spin degrees of freedom ( see figure  [ spin ] ) .",
    "we define the spin states @xmath108 and @xmath109 by applying a static in - plane magnetic field @xmath110 , which splits them in energy by @xmath111 ( @xmath112 for gaas ) . the electron state is then represented by its charge and spin states @xmath113 which we abbreviate to @xmath114 . since an electron in the orbital ground state",
    "@xmath15 maintains its spin coherence over long times @xmath115 , we choose @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the two metastable states .",
    "the resonator couples @xmath118 to @xmath119 ; to complete the raman transition , we need a mechanism which simultaneously flips the charge and spin state between @xmath119 and @xmath116 .",

    "since auxiliary adjacent spin qubits can accomplish conditional dynamics @xcite , long - distance state transfer is sufficient to attain this objective . in this section",
    "we present an analysis of the coupling rates and the loss of coherence associated with state transfer using a far - off - resonant raman transition .",

    "this g - factor shift could be applied to a single dot . although working near @xmath168 will vastly reduce the heat load associated with esr , the system will be more sensitive to low frequency fluctuations in the electromagnetic environment .",

    "operation at such large fields , however , would necessitate using a type ii superconductor to construct the resonator . since the flux - pinning mechanisms which allow high - field superconductivity also contribute to residual surface impedance , resonators constructed of type ii materials would likely have lower quality factors .",

    "<S> we describe an electrodynamic mechanism for coherent , quantum mechanical coupling between spacially separated quantum dots on a microchip . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is based on capacitive interactions between the electron charge and a superconducting transmission line resonator , and is closely related to atomic cavity quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate several potential applications of this technique which have varying degrees of complexity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that this mechanism allows design and investigation of an on - chip double - dot microscopic maser . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the interaction may be extended to couple spatially separated electron spin states while only virtually populating fast - decaying superpositions of charge states . </S>",
    "<S> this represents an effective , controllable long - range interaction , which may facilitate implementation of quantum information processing with electron spin qubits and potentially allow coupling to other quantum systems such as atomic or superconducting qubits . </S>"
