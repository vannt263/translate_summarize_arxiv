    "the discovery of flavour mixing of atmospheric and solar neutrinos in the golden years of neutrino oscillations ( 1998 - 2004 ) has led to extensive theoretical and experimental effort in neutrino physics , worldwide .",
    "precision measurements of flavour mixing parameters in the lepton sector opens up yet another window in our quest for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "neutrino oscillation phenomena are described in terms of six independent parameters namely , three mixing angles  ( @xmath7 ) , two mass squared differences  ( @xmath8 ) and a cp - violating phase  ( @xmath2 ) . in the last decade , data from solar and reactor neutrino experiments have resulted in information on the sign and magnitude of @xmath9 and a precise value of @xmath10  @xcite . the atmospheric parameters @xmath11 and @xmath3 have been measured and their precision will be increased by t2k  @xcite and no@xmath12a  @xcite .",
    "recent measurements of @xmath0 from t2k  @xcite , minos  @xcite , and double chooz  @xcite indicated a non zero value of @xmath0 .",
    "this year , a moderately large value of @xmath0 has been established by the reactor experiments .",
    "daya bay  @xcite claimed that @xmath0 is non vanishing with a significance of 5.2 standard deviations while reno  @xcite measured a larger central value but with a slightly lower significance of 4.9@xmath13 coming from their higher systematic error .",
    "in fact , the global fits  @xcite of neutrino oscillation parameters including these recent measurements exclude @xmath14 at 10.2@xmath13 .",
    "large @xmath0 enables a wide range of possibilities for determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy , the value of @xmath2 and the octant of @xmath3  the remaining unknown neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "in fact , a non zero value of @xmath0 is a prerequisite to probe these unknowns .",
    "neutrino mass hierarchy or the neutrino mass ordering has profound theoretical implications .",
    "till now we have been unable to resolve the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e , whether the hierarchy is normal  ( nh , @xmath15 ) or inverted  ( ih , @xmath16 ) . for neutrinos passing through long baselines , the effect on oscillation parameters in presence of earth matter  @xcite is dependent on the sign of @xmath1 , hence such long baseline experiments can resolve the question of mass hierarchy .",
    "moreover , the effect of the matter potential ( enhancement or suppression ) for each hierarchy is different for neutrinos versus antineutrinos , requiring charge identification of the final lepton produced in the interaction of the neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) with the detector material .",
    "these earth matter effects are enhanced if @xmath0 is sufficiently large , improving the chances of discovery of mass hierarchy .    with the favourable large @xmath0",
    ", future atmospheric neutrino experiments will play a crucial role in determination of mass hierarchy through disappearance channels ( muon and electron ) .",
    "preliminary studies of the india - based neutrino observatory ( ino )  @xcite indicate that , ino with its charge identification capability of muons , will be able to make a measurement at @xmath17 statistical significance , with @xmath18-year exposure  @xcite .",
    "similar sensitivity will be possible at hyperkamiokande  @xcite ( with electron events ) and with pingu at icecube  @xcite , while better sensitivity will be achievable with a rather futuristic magnetized liquid argon detector  @xcite with visibility of both muon and electron events .",
    "accelerator long baseline experiments like t2k and no@xmath12a will have good sensitivity but only for some fraction of the @xmath2 range .",
    "in fact , recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , a combined analysis of t2k and no@xmath12a has been performed and it is found that mass hierarchy can only be determined for @xmath19 if the true hierarchy is nh and @xmath20 if it is ih , indicating the difficulty in achieving this without knowlege of the true @xmath2 , unless statistics is sufficiently high  @xcite . however , a detailed study of neutrino mass hierarchy performed in ref .",
    "@xcite has demonstrated that the use of atmospheric data from the proposed ino in conjunction with accelerator beam experiments t2k and no@xmath12a results in a 3@xmath13 determination of hierarchy with a high resolution @xmath21 detector for @xmath22 . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have shown that mass hierarchy can be determined for any value of @xmath2 from the near resonant matter effect in the @xmath23 oscillation channel at 5@xmath13 with a superbeam with an average neutrino energy of @xmath24 at super - kamiokande that is at a distance of @xmath25 from the proposed superbeam facility at cern .    in this paper",
    "we wish to focus on the proposed low energy neutrino factory ( lenf ) for the mass hierarchy determination . in a neutrino factory",
    "both @xmath26 and @xmath27 beams are produced from the decay of muon  ( @xmath28 ) in the long straight sections of a storage ring .",
    "a @xmath29 decay produces @xmath30 and @xmath4 whereas a @xmath31 decays to @xmath32 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence a detailed study of various oscillation channels such as @xmath23 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and all the corresponding antineutrino oscillations are possible using a neutrino factory .",
    "in addition there are the tau appearance channels , however , these can be utilized only in the presence of a far detector with tau lepton identification capability .",
    "apart from the availability of large number of channels , this facility is preferred due to the feasibility of high beam intensity and accurate knowledge of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "the so called ` golden ' channel , i.e , the @xmath34 oscillation , contains information on all the oscillation parameters and hence in principle can be used to determine all the unknown parameters .",
    "however , degenerate solutions in the parameter space make this task difficult . till",
    "recently , since the unknowns were : @xmath0 , cp violating phase @xmath2 , the octant of @xmath3 ( if nonmaximal ) and the mass hierarchy , this resulted in an eight fold parameter degeneracy  @xcite , making it hard to extract unique values of the parameters .",
    "the solution to this problem was first provided in ref .",
    "they found that at the ` magic ' baseline of around @xmath36 , the @xmath34 oscillation probability does not depend on the cp phase @xmath2 irrespective of the beam energy .",
    "indeed it would be possible to determine the mass hierarchy at the magic baseline and the high energy neutrino factory ( henf ) would be the suitable facility for this long baseline study .",
    "the physics potential of a henf has been studied by various authors  @xcite and a detail analysis of optimization of the neutrino factory baseline by the ids - nf group suggests two baselines : one at the magic baseline @xmath37 and the other at @xmath38 with a muon beam energy of @xmath39  @xcite .",
    "recent studies however suggested that a lenf with a baseline of @xmath40  ( fnal to dusel ) with a muon beam energy of @xmath41 could achieve the desired precision if @xmath0 is large enough  @xcite .",
    "a re - optimization of the neutrino factory resulted in the proposal for a staged approach  @xcite , which may have the option of much lower  ( @xmath42 ) muon beam energies and shorter baselines  ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the lenf has already been shown to have excellent sensitivity to the mass hierarchy from the golden and the platinum , @xmath23 channels  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been shown that only if @xmath44 , mass hierarchy can be determined at 5@xmath13 independently of @xmath2 at muon beam energies more than @xmath45 and baselines longer than @xmath46 , using the golden channel .    in this study , we show that , with the knowledge of @xmath0 from the recent reactor experiments , determination of mass hierarchy can be made completely free of degeneracies by exploiting the electron disappearance channel . for electron disappearance ( @xmath47 ) , the oscillation probability @xmath48 for neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) of energy @xmath49 traveling over a baseline of length @xmath50 in the presence of matter potential @xmath51 , can be expressed as a perturbative expansion in the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 as  @xcite : @xmath54 where , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the fermi constant and @xmath58 is the electron density .",
    "the sign of the potential @xmath59 is positive for neutrinos and negative for antineutrinos . from eq .",
    "[ eq : pee ] , one can see that since this oscillation channel is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it is free from the degeneracies arising from the unkown octant of @xmath3 and from the lack of knowledge of the cp violating phase . hence , at least in principle , it is possible to use this channel to determine the hierarchy independently of both these parameter values .",
    "previous studies of the neutrino factories performance had ignored this channel .",
    "the reason being that one assumed that @xmath0 is perhaps very small .",
    "mass hierarchy sensitivity of a setup was then judged by the smallest value of @xmath60 above which the wrong hierarchy could be excluded . in @xmath48 , since the mass hierarchy sensitive term is quadratic in @xmath53 , therefore one did not expect much sensitivity for small reactor angles .",
    "on the other hand in the golden channel while there is one atmospheric ( mass hierarchy sensitive ) term appearing with @xmath61 dependence and could dominate only for large @xmath62 mixing angle , but in addition , there is also an interference term which is linear in @xmath63 which allows mass hierarchy sensitivity for intermediate values also .",
    "for very small @xmath0 , sensitivity was expected only with very high intensity neutrino beams and long baselines to enhance the matter effect and hence henfs of @xmath64 beam energies and rather long baselines were considered .",
    "feasibility of mass hierarchy determination with these facilities was shown even for as small values as @xmath65 . in case of muon disappearance",
    ", there are many terms which are sensitive to mass hierarchy , with coefficients independent of @xmath0 but quadratic in solar mass squared difference , ones that depend on @xmath66 as well as those which are linear in @xmath53 and the solar mass squared difference . with many terms of differing signs , for a small value of the reactor angle , sensitivity was possible again only by going to long baselines and high energy intense beams , while with large values it is feasible even with atmospheric neutrinos as described earlier . apart from the dependence on the @xmath62 mixing angle",
    ", the sensitivity to systematics for the electron disappearance channel also had a role to play .",
    "any experiment that measures events coming from @xmath48 , a disappearance channel , has to detect a small deficit in the expected number of neutrino events .",
    "the extent of the deficit depends of course on the value of @xmath0 . in the light of recent measurements indicating a large value of @xmath0 , we claim that it is possible to extract information about the hierarchy from this channel .",
    "focussing in this paper on the electron disappearance channel at lenf , we demonstrate that for a large value of @xmath0  ( daya bay range ) it is possible to exclude the wrong hierachy at a @xmath67 for all values of @xmath2 and any octant of @xmath3 , irrespective of the choice of the true hierarchy .",
    "hence unlike all other oscillation channels , this channel can be used for a clean determination of the mass hierarchy not just at some magic baselines , but rather for all baselines greater than about @xmath68 corresponding to muon beam energies about @xmath69 or larger . moreover",
    ", this channel can give us an independent confirmation of hierarchy measurement from the golden channel .",
    "the possibility of using electron disappearance channel to study mass hierarchy has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of a @xmath70-beam as a @xmath4 source , however , this requires rather high boost power .",
    "after the recent measurement of a large @xmath0 value , the possibilty of determining mass hierarchy with electron disappearance with reactor neutrinos has also been investigated again by several authors .",
    "authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have concluded that such a measurement will be difficult due to the finite detector energy resolution , while ref .",
    "@xcite have described the challenges and possible solutions . in ref .  @xcite it is pointed out that with rather large exposures , @xmath71 mass hierarchy discrimination seems feasible .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ det ] , we start with a brief description of our experimental setup and then provide a detail description of the numerical simulations .",
    "the results are reported in section  [ res ] with a conclusion in section  [ con ] .",
    "with the large value of @xmath0 confirmed independently by daya bay and reno reactor experiments , the lenf is a good facility to determine the mass hierarchy .",
    "a lenf with a baseline of @xmath40 ( fnal to dusel ) and a muon beam energy of @xmath41 was first proposed in ref .",
    "it was shown that for sufficiently high statistics and detection efficiency , an optimized lenf can be an excellent set up for precision measurements of oscillation parameters for a large value of @xmath0 . in the context of lenf ,",
    "two types of detector technologies have been discussed in the literature : a @xmath72 magnetized totally active scintillator detector  ( tasd ) and a @xmath21 liquid argon detector  ( lar ) with charge identification capabilities of both electrons and muons .    in our study , we consider an lenf setup of ref .",
    "@xcite with a magnetized @xmath72 tasd with an energy resolution of @xmath73 for all channels and a lower energy threshold of @xmath74 .",
    "the detection efficiency of the tasd is @xmath75 below and @xmath76 above @xmath77 for electron events with a background at the @xmath78 level .",
    "we use a lenf with @xmath79 useful muons per year per polarity and a running time of @xmath80 years . in our initial analysis",
    "we use a baseline of @xmath81 and muon beam energy @xmath82 . for more details on low energy neutrino factory",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our goal is to investigate the performance of the above lenf setup in determining the neutrino mass hierarchy using electron disappearance channel , as this channel has the advantage of being independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "earlier , with @xmath0 unknown ( and hence possibly very tiny ) , most studies used to look for the hierarchy reach in @xmath60 , defining it as the limiting value of @xmath60 above which the wrong hierarchy could be excluded at a chosen confidence level . now that @xmath83 has been measured to be fairly large with good precision",
    ", there is no point in trying to find the minimum @xmath83 for which the wrong heirarchy can be distinguished . instead , for most of our analysis",
    ", we use the central value of @xmath60 from reno , as well as the value corresponding to 2@xmath13 lower limit of @xmath84 coming from the global fit  @xcite and see if the electron disappearance channel alone can achieve the desired precision .    for our numerical simulations , we use the following true values of the oscillation parameters : for the leading atmospheric parameters , we use @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for the solar parameters , we use @xmath87 and @xmath88 . for the third mixing angle @xmath0",
    ", we use the central value of @xmath89 from reno . the unknown cp violating phase @xmath2 is varied over its full range @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath92 , an effective mass - squared difference measured in @xmath32 survival probability , is related to @xmath1 via  @xcite @xmath93 to evaluate the event rates for production of electrons in the detector , we use the differential neutrino factory flux , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 corresponds to flavour of neutrinos , double differential cross - section @xmath96 for cc interactions ( quasi - elastic , resonance and deep inelastic processes ) producing an electron ( positron ) in the detector and the kinematic constraints that have been described in detail in ref .",
    "the event rates for production of electrons ( positrons ) in the detector are defined as @xmath97 where @xmath98 accounts for the exposure ( size of detector and years of running ) , @xmath99 are the detection efficiencies and the oscillation probability @xmath100 is a function of the energy @xmath49 of the neutrino and the length of the baseline traveled by the neutrino , before reaching the detector . the integration is over all the relevant variables , including resolution function , corresponding to bins in the observed lepton energy , @xmath101 .    for our statistical analysis",
    ", we use a gaussian @xmath102 with the events coming from both @xmath4 and @xmath5 disappearance channels .",
    "we generate our experimental data for a fixed or true hierarchy keeping all other parameters fixed .",
    "the theoretical data is then generated using the other , wrong hierarchy .",
    "the resulting @xmath102 thus determines the confidence level at which the wrong hierarchy can be excluded .",
    "however , for realistic analysis one needs to marginalize over all the parameters in order to include the uncertainties coming from them . thus the minimum @xmath102 is determined after taking all the variations into account . for our analysis ,",
    "priors are used for the measured oscillation parameters .",
    "an error of @xmath73 is taken for the atmospheric parameters @xmath103 and @xmath104 and @xmath105 on the solar parameters @xmath106 and @xmath9 .",
    "the error on the value of @xmath107 is taken to be @xmath108 .",
    "note that these priors are very conservative .",
    "daya bay is expected to reduce the error on @xmath60 to 0.005 by 2016 .",
    "more data from borexino  @xcite , t2k  @xcite and no@xmath12a  @xcite will make more precise measurements of solar and atmospheric parameters , before the lenf can be constructed . for the systematics , we have used normalization error of @xmath109 for the signal and @xmath110 for the background .",
    "we also include a small tilt of @xmath111 for the signal as well as for the background .",
    "we have included only the charge mis - identification background , at a level of @xmath78 for the @xmath27 disappearance channels .",
    "we now proceed to analyse the hierarchy determination ability of electron disappearance channel using a low energy neutrino factory .",
    "first we fix all the oscillation parameters at their central values reported in section  [ det ] and set @xmath112 and @xmath113 . using the standard lenf setup of muon beam energy of @xmath41 and a baseline of @xmath81 , described in the last section and considering running time of @xmath80 years",
    ", we evaluate the number of electron ( positron ) events that would be observed in the detector . the number of these events resulting from @xmath114 interactions as a function of the observed lepton energy , corresponding to each of the hierarchies are displayed in fig .",
    "[ events ] . in our entire study",
    "we continue to use the same tasd detector mass , energy resolution , electron detection efficiency , background level and number of useful muons per polarity , mentioned in section  [ det ] and are as specified in ref .",
    "@xcite , even when the muon beam energy and baseline length are varied .",
    "the role of systematics and relative value of @xmath60 in the electron disappearance channel had been discussed in section  [ intro ] .",
    "we now substantiate our claim , that for the current value of @xmath60 , one can distinguish between the two hierarchies in spite of systematic uncertainties . in fig .",
    "[ events_syst ] , we have plotted the @xmath115 and @xmath116 events for nh and ih for @xmath117 ( @xmath118 current value ) and for @xmath119 ( a much smaller value ) .",
    "bands around the event rates denote the combination of errors , statistical and systematic added in quadrature .",
    "one can see that for @xmath120 , the errors are larger than the difference between the event rates for the two hierarchies .",
    "even if the exposure and hence statistics is increased by say a factor of 10 , reducing the relative statistical error , systematic effects will still result in an overlap between nh and ih .",
    "therefore hierarchy discrimination is not possible .",
    "however , for @xmath121 , we see that there is enough separation between the events corresponding to the two hierarchies . hence , with large enough @xmath62 mixing angle , it is possible to go beyond the regime where electron disappearance had been a systematics - riddled channel .         for this lenf setup ,",
    "we determine the exclusion region in the true value of @xmath0 and true value of @xmath2 plane , for which the wrong hierarchy can be excluded at @xmath71 and @xmath67 . fig .",
    "[ hier ] exhibits this region and is to be interpreted as being on the right of the contours .",
    "these results have been obtained after marginalization over all the oscillation parameters and shown for both normal and inverted hierarchies .",
    "we find that hierarchy can be determined at all values of @xmath2 , leading to the contours being vertical lines .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ hier ] that if the true hierarchy is nh , then above @xmath122 the wrong hierarchy , i.e , ih can be excluded at @xmath67 . if ih is the true hierarchy , then nh can be eliminated at @xmath67 for @xmath123 and beyond . also , above @xmath124",
    ", the wrong hierarchy can be excluded at @xmath71 , irrespective of the true hierarchy .        to investigate the hierarchy sensitivity to baselines  ( @xmath50 ) , muon beam energy  ( @xmath125 ) , and different detector characteristics such as energy resolution , efficiency etc , requires a complex numerical optimization . in order to find the optimal baseline and the muon beam energy in determining the mass hierarchy , we assume nh to be the true hierarchy",
    ". we fix our @xmath60 in the @xmath71 range of the current best fit value .",
    "we have analysed the @xmath102 for different values of baselines in the range  @xmath126 and for different values of @xmath125 .",
    "we have performed this analysis for the lenf setup with a running time of @xmath80 and @xmath127 years for the parent muon beam energy @xmath125 starting at @xmath128 and going up to @xmath129 .",
    "we keep all oscillation parameters fixed at their central values , while @xmath113 .",
    "we have included the charge mis - identification background at the level of @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - chisq ] , we use the central value of @xmath112 measured by reno as our true value .",
    "the two horizontal lines in the plot indicate the @xmath102 corresponding to @xmath71 and @xmath67 . from this figure one",
    "notices that with only 2 years of data , the minimum baselines required for exclusion of the wrong hierarchy at @xmath67 , vary from @xmath130 to @xmath131 , corresponding to @xmath132 muon beams and that with increased data from 5 years , the spread in the minimum baselines required reduces appreciably , particularly for higher energies , resulting in baselines in the range @xmath133 being sufficient for a mass hierarchy discrimination for the same @xmath134 range .",
    "thus as long as we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 , hierarchy determination is possible at about @xmath67 using the electron disappearance channel alone .",
    "we next plot the contours correponding to 3@xmath13 and 5@xmath13 mass hierarchy dicrimination in the @xmath137 plane and these are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - emu ] . for these plots",
    "we marginalize over all the oscillation parameters .",
    "the true value of @xmath138 have been used in the left panel . while the first value is the best fit value from reno , the second smaller value is 2@xmath13 lower limit of the global fit of the neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "the left figure shows the variation of the contours with change in the magnitude of @xmath60 , whereas the right figure shows the variation for a fixed value with change in exposure .",
    "again , higher exposure is more effective in reducing the minimum baseline than the minimum energy , required for a @xmath139 mass hierarchy discrimination . with 5 years data , beyond @xmath140 gev , there is negligible change in the minimum baseline needed for a @xmath67 mass hierarchy determination .",
    "moreover , the marginalization of parameters seems to slightly further reduce the spread in minimum baselines for the @xmath141 muon beam energies , at which this measurement is feasible .",
    "while we have shown the contours corresponding only to the normal hierarchy being the true one , however , similar results also hold for the case of inverted hierarchy being true , with minor changes in the values of minimum baseline and muon beam energy at which a @xmath139 mass hierarchy discrimination is achieved .",
    "we would like to mention that since our studies indicate that even with muon beam energies as low as @xmath142 , electron disappearance can be used for mass hierarchy determination , hence in principle , this could also be done at the proposed very low energy neutrino factory ( vlenf )  @xcite , in conjunction with an additional far detector .",
    "the vlenf is being proposed as a setup for a short baseline experiment to resolve the several observed anomalies which could possibly arise from ev - scale sterile neutrinos  @xcite . in practise",
    "however , for measurements at a detector @xmath68 away , as the neutrino beam will have to be pointed towards it , this would require that the decay ring for nustorm be built on a slope and the near detector located underground , leading to huge additional construction costs  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the flux at vlenf will be few orders of magnitude smaller than that achievable at a lenf and hence this option does not seem feasible .",
    "precision measurement of all the oscillation parameters is the main goal of future neutrino factories . although some parameters are measured to a very good accuracy , there are still some unknowns such as the dirac cp phase @xmath2 , neutrino mass hierarchy and the octant of the atmospheric angle @xmath3 .",
    "recent measurements by daya bay , double chooz , and reno have confirmed a large value of @xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a rather optimistic scenario for determination of all these unknown parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the possibility of using the electron disappearance channel , i.e , the @xmath143 oscillation , at a low energy neutrino factory ( lenf ) to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "while the @xmath144 golden channel , has been extensively studied for determination of parameters at lenf , the electron disappearance channel has the advantage of being independent of the other unknowns : cp violating phase @xmath2 and octant of @xmath3 .",
    "we find that for muon beam energies @xmath135 and baselines @xmath145 , the electron disappearance channel has the capability of neutrino mass hierarchy determination at @xmath67 , for an exposure of a @xmath72 totally active scintillating detector to two years of each muon polarity , with @xmath79 useful muons decays per year .",

    "<S> recent measurements of large @xmath0 by daya bay and reno reactor experiments have opened up the possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. the sign of the mass squared splitting @xmath1 , the cp - violating phase @xmath2 and the octant of @xmath3 . in the light of this result </S>",
    "<S> , we study the performance of a low energy neutrino factory ( lenf ) for determination of the mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explore the potential of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 disappearance channels at lenf to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , that is free from the uncertainties arising from the unknown @xmath2 phase and the @xmath3 octant . </S>",
    "<S> we find that using these electron neutrino ( antineutrino ) disappearance channels with a standard lenf , it is possible to exclude the wrong hierarchy at @xmath6 with only 2 years of running . </S>"
