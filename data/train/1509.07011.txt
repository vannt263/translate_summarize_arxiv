    "to be convinced , one just has to note that simulated near - field @xmath15 components oscillate on distances shorter than 130 nm whereas tpl maps have a diffraction - limited resolution of 270 nm since they are far - field images related to @xmath16 .",
    "the resonance lengths ( 100 and 380 nm ) correspond to the first ( @xmath17=1 ) and third ( @xmath17=3 ) order plasmonic modes since @xmath15 presents respectively one and three field maxima inside the nanorods ( the m index is the ratio between the nanorod length and the effective wavelength as described below in the fabry perot description of resonances ) .",

    "[ hg00-fig](a ) . indeed , as previously mentioned , confocal maps result from the convolution of the spatial intensity distributions of the sp modes and of the excitation beam which is here modified by the spatial phase shaping .",

    "fig.[hg01-fig](b ) shows that the confocal tpl map of 96 nm long nanorod is mainly composed of two lobes as expected for a focused @xmath5 beam . note that the asymmetric lobe intensities result from imperfections of the home - made @xmath6/4-step gold mirror .",
    "enlarged confocal map of the resonant 250 nm long nanorod exhibits three tpl maxima .",

    "the dark nature of these modes is confirmed by the presence of a @xmath7-phase change at the center of the nanorods which also ensures a good match with the @xmath5 phase profile .",
    "here , we unambiguously demonstrate the selective excitation of dark plasmonic modes by phase - shaping the excitation beam .",
    "one has to note that dark modes do not radiate by essence .",
    "nevertheless , tpl which does not depend of the mode dipolar nature is still exalted at resonances ( even if dark ) since it is only sensitive to the local field intensity .",
    "tpl is then powerful to probe both bright and dark resonances of sps .",
    "finally , we anticipate that more complex phase - shaped beams ( eventually produced by spatial light modulators ) could be used to efficiently excite higher - order bright or dark modes .",
    "lsp resonances can be described by the commonly accepted fabry perot resonator description of localized surface plasmon resonances  @xcite . here , the fundamental propagating mode of a gold nanowire ( not shown here ) with a cross - section of 55  nm@xmath135  nm has a calculated effective index @xmath21 of 3.03 .",

    "bright and dark lsps differ by their near - field distributions , and also by their far field scattering properties which are also dictated by the order of the modes  @xcite . in fig .",

    "these fourier - plane images show that the bright modes principally radiate in a direction orthogonal to the nanorod long axis as expected from a dipolar emission .",
    "in particular , shortest nanorods have a dipolar - like pattern whereas the longest one exhibit fringes due to interferences originating from light scattered from different nanorod positions .",
    "it results from these interferences that the central fringe is narrower for longer nanorods and the directivity is then increased .",
    "following the same approach , the images of fig .",
    "[ fourier - fig ] ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) concern the @xmath5 excitation of the @xmath17=2 and @xmath17=4 dark lsp resonances and from the non resonant nanorod .",
    "it is worth to note that dark modes poorly scatter in far - field , and the experimental signal from these modes is at least ten times lower than bright modes .",

    "the fourier images of fig .",
    "[ fourier - fig ] ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) clearly differ from those of bright modes .",

    "the orthogonality of the local field distribution between these modes appears here : in this plane orthogonal to the nanorod axis , bright modes constructively interfere whereas dark modes destructively interfere .",
    "indeed , the @xmath5 excitation generates out - of - phase plasmon in both nanorod sides .",
    "furthermore , it is especially interesting to note that the directivity of the emission from 250 nm long resonant nanorod is tilted by 90 degrees from the directivity of brights modes .",
    "et al_. reported similar emission patterns resulting from a near - field excitation of single nanorods with a quantum dot placed in the vicinity of plasmonic elements @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "the radiation patterns are obtained by scattering the laser field onto the antennas .",
    "since the same modes are excited , the angular symmetry of the scattered radiation is the same as in @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the signal is fundamentally different . with our approach",
    ", we demonstrate that the control of the spatial phase - profile of the optical excitation is a powerful tool to engineer the directivity of an optical antenna .",
    "furthermore , from our measurements it seems that in the fourier images do not conserve information on the mode orders and are only governed by the nanorod diffraction figures .",
    "more precisely , resonant nanorods have emission patterns similar to off - resonance nanorods of similar lengths ( not shown ) and only the intensity is modified . here , the fourier images are only sensitive to the parity of the excited mode .",
    "experimental emission patterns are also confronted to th ose calculated using the green s dyad technique . to this aim",
    ", we first calculate the electric field inside the nanostructure as described in @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we use a plane wave excitation to simulate the @xmath2 excitation and a plane wave excitation but with a @xmath7-phase shift for negative x to compare to the @xmath5 excitation .",
    "then the intensity scattered in the fourier plane is calculated using the asymptotic expansion of the green s dyad @xcite .",
    "calculated fourier - plane images are reported in fig .",
    "[ fourier - fig ] ( g - l ) .",
    "the main features of experimental images : 1 ) the increase in directivity for longest nanorods , 2 ) the change in orientation of emission from bright to dark modes and 3 ) the zero emission in the nanorod perpendicular plane for dark modes are well described by the calculations .",
    "this technique also describes the fine structure of the emission patterns of the @xmath2 excited longest nanorods for which two lobes appear on both sides of the main fringe .",
    "if this technique is in good agreement with experimental measurements and allows to anticipate the emission properties of plasmonic nano - antenna , it is highly time consuming especially for multi - element and large scale antenna like yagi - uda",
    ".    then we propose a simple model to describe the nanorod emission pattern which is only based on the emission of two dipoles . in this basic model only two dipoles are considered . depending on the dark or bright mode , they oscillate in phase or they are @xmath7-dephased as depicted at the left of figure  [ fourier - fig](m ) and ( p ) .",

    "the accurate comparison with experimental emission patterns of bright and dark modes of short antenna is quite surprising and gives us a better understanding on the origin of the angular emission patterns .",
    "indeed , the physical meaning of this two - dipole based model corresponds to a fourier - plane pattern essentially governed by radiations from the nanorod extremities .",
    "it indicates that the radiative losses along the nanorods can be neglected for antenna shorter than 700 nm and only extremities emissions can be considered .",
    "then , bright or dark modes only differ from the phase between extremities emissions . for longer antenna ,",
    "the radiations all along the nanorod start to take an important role in the scattering patterns and have to be taken into account .",
    "the resulting patterns are then governed by diffraction figures as reported by sersic @xmath26 @xcite . however , we anticipate that the simplicity of this two - dipoles model can help to estimate the emission patterns of complex multi - element structures interacting through bright and/or dark modes .",
    "furthermore , it has the advantage to propose analytical solutions and is poorly time - consuming compared to full-3d method like green or fem methods .",
    "to summarize , we used tightly focused hermit - gaussian modes to selectively excite bright and dark plasmonic eigenmodes sustained by individual gold nanorods .",
    "non - linear photoluminescence was used as probe of the local field maxima generated by the even or odd natures of the modes . in particular",
    ", we were able to unambiguously demonstrate the excitation of dark modes by introducing a @xmath7-shift in the excitation beam .",
    "we further showed that the emission pattern features the symmetry of the mode and can be qualitatively understood by considering two dipoles oscillating in phase or out of phase at the nanorod extremities .",
