    "one of the fundamental distinctions of the quantum world from the classical world is expressed by the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",

    "it is clear , eve will want to make the process output as near to the ideal output as possible .",
    "how well eve can do ?",
    "this question was originally considered by hillery and buek in @xcite .",
    "they examined approximate cloning machines destined for copying of prescribed two non - orthogonal states . in paper",
    "@xcite such devices were called state - dependent cloners. writers of @xcite introduced the notion of global fidelity and constructed the optimal symmetric state - dependent cloner which optimizes the global fidelity . of course ,",
    "the evaluation of quality for one or another of potential cloners is dependent on the used measure of closeness to the ideality .",
    "as is readily seen from the text , papers @xcite and @xcite are based on the distinct optimality criteria .",
    "measure used by hillery and buek can be named absolute error of copying of two - state set . in work",
    "@xcite the global fidelity was maximized .",
    "however , a degree of similarity for states those are subject to cloning is taken into account neither by the absolute error nor by the global fidelity .",
    "it is small wonder , because these measures are simply related .",
    "meanwhile , the consideration of similarity for states to be copied may have practical sense . in general , it would be useful to have some set of optimality criteria every of those elucidates one or another of facets of the state - dependent cloning . in this work",
    "we propose the new criterion for estimation of quality for the state - dependent cloning .",
    "we call this criterion the relative error because the one compares the errors in the copies with contiguous size that is not independent of degree of similarity for states to be copied .",
    "the lower bound on the relative error is obtained . in our analysis",
    "we do not specify the dimension of particle state space , although with applied viewpoint the two - dimensional case is most interesting .",
    "we also supplement and reinforce the results obtained by hillery and buek @xcite .",
    "in particular , the relationship between the size of error and the absolute value of the deviation of the resulting probability distribution from the desired probability distribution is shown , as well as stronger bound is obtained .    in the examination",

    "the notion of the relative error can be motived in the following way .",
    "let us take that we want distinguishing the input state by measurement made on the copying output .",
    "if the modulus @xmath122 is close to 1 then the lower bound on the absolute error is close to 0 and the upper bound on the global fidelity is close to 1 . in this case",

    "it would be a rashness to think so .",

    "but if so , are we able to decide that given output should be related to this ideal output and not to that one ? to express this in quantitative form we should use some measure of closeness for states @xmath123 and @xmath124 . since according to ( [ prob4 ] ) @xmath125 the quantity",

    "the closeness of @xmath127 to @xmath123 and the closeness of @xmath128 to @xmath124 are described by the sizes @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively .",
    "it is not without significance that @xmath126 is size of the same kind .",
    "therefore , it is advisable to compare the absolute error with pointed quantity .",

    "( [ abs1 ] ) and ( [ condit ] ) , for the case ( i ) we have @xmath144 the last relation , @xmath145 and the trigonometric formula for sine of difference give @xmath146 it must be stressed that the equality @xmath147 is necessary for the equality in eq .",
    "( [ cot ] ) .",
    "we want minimizing the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cot ] ) in the interval @xmath148 established by eq .",
    "( [ keyunit ] ) and the case ( i ) condition . since the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cot ] ) increases as the cotangent decreases and the cotangent is a decreasing function of one s argument , the required minimum is reached at the left boundary point of the interval stated above .",
    "therefore , in the case ( i ) @xmath149 moreover , we can see that in the case ( i ) the inequality @xmath150 holds .",
    "in the case ( ii ) we have @xmath151 , because @xmath152 according to the definition of the angle .",
    "next , the case ( ii ) condition can be separated into two alternatives , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the first alternative contains @xmath155 in the second alternative the conditions @xmath156 and @xmath154 provide @xmath157 , that can be easily verified by elementary methods .",
    "thus , in the case ( ii ) @xmath158 and @xmath159 . to sum up , we see that the lower bound on the relative error is given by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ icasmin ] ) . designating @xmath160 ,",
    "hence @xmath161 , the right - hand side of ( [ icasmin ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath162 .",
    "thus , the relative error of copying of two - state set @xmath119 must be at least as large as the right - hand side of ( [ theore1 ] ) that is plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "we can see that in the greater part of interval @xmath163 $ ] the function increases and only in the vicinity of the right boundary point the one becomes decreasing . in general , the obtained result is clear .",
    "the more states @xmath121 and @xmath4 are close to each other , the less chances eve has for the information extraction .",
    "thus , the lower bound on the relative error advises that alice and bob should make encoding states @xmath121 and @xmath4 as close as possible up to the vicinity in which the one slightly decreases .",
    "however , the characteristics of a communication system can rather limit a closeness for encoding states .",
    "in addition , if two values @xmath164 and @xmath165 ( where @xmath166 ) give the same lower bound on the absolute error , value @xmath165 is more preffered , since for @xmath165 the lower bound on the relative error is larger than for @xmath167 .",
    "as it is shown , in this case the distinction between the bounds on the relative error can be significant .",
    "next , the reasons used for proof of theorem 1 have established the inequality @xmath168 that can be rewritten in the following way .    * theorem 2 * _ the absolute error of cloning for set @xmath0 has the lower bound : _",
    "@xmath169    thus , the absolute error of copying of two - state set @xmath119 must be at least as large as the right - hand side of ( [ theore2 ] ) . for small @xmath170",
    "this function behaves as @xmath170 , for small positive @xmath171 one behaves as @xmath172 .",
    "the maximal value of the lower bound ( [ theore1 ] ) is equal to @xmath173 and occurs for @xmath174 .",
    "the general bound @xmath175 was obtained in paper @xcite .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ theoremhb ] ) takes its maximal value @xmath176 , when @xmath177 . for @xmath177 our bound",

    "@xmath170 the right - hand side of ( [ theoremhb ] ) behaves as @xmath170 , for small positive @xmath171 one behaves as @xmath179 .",
    "thus , we see that the lower bound given by ( [ theore1 ] ) is stronger than the lower bound ( [ theoremhb ] ) .",
    "the distinction is perceptable in the intermediate range of values of @xmath170 and for values of @xmath170 close to 1 .",
    "for example , at @xmath180 our bound is approximatelly @xmath181 of the bound given by ( [ theoremhb ] ) .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ theore1 ] ) and the right - hand side of ( [ theoremhb ] ) are plotted as functions of @xmath170 in fig .  2 by the solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "as fig .  2 shows , the bound ( [ theoremhb ] ) is symmetric with respect to point @xmath177 , whereas the bound ( [ theore1 ] ) is asymmetric .",
    "thus , the presented approach has allowed to reinforce the lower bound derived by hillery and buek @xcite .    in principle , both lower bounds given by theorems 1 and 2 can be reached without auxiliary device .",
    "then a unitary operator @xmath65 acts on the hilbert space of @xmath182 qubits : @xmath183 for @xmath114 , and there is @xmath184 .",
    "it is clear that the necessary condition for minimization of the errors is the equality in eq .",

    "( [ keyunit ] ) holds only if both final states @xmath127 and @xmath128 lie in plane @xmath185 .",

    "( [ symclo2 ] ) is equal to zero ) .",

    "note that for any symmetric state - dependent cloner the relative error must be at least as large as @xmath195 .",
    "we shall now propose an asymmetric cloner for which the relative error of copying for set @xmath196 is rigorously equal to the right - hand side of eq .",
