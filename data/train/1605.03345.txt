    "the pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas ) has mapped the stellar populations of our nearest neighbour , m31 , from its central regions out to 150 kpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to this impressive imaging database , we have also obtained spectroscopic observations for tens of thousands of red giant branch stars ( rgbs ) throughout m31 s disk , halo , satellites , and streams using keck ii deimos .",
    "this follow - up survey - named z - pandas - has been used to measure the masses of m31 s vast satellite system ( e.g. @xcite ) , uncover an extended and thick disk population in the system ( @xcite ) , map the m31 halo ( @xcite ) and analyse a number of its streams and substructures ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in these proceedings , we focus on recent work comparing the properties of dwarf galaxies found on and off the vast plane of satellites in m31 ; as well as presenting kinematics for a possible extension to m31 s most significant recent merger , the giant southern stream .",
    "to date , 31 dwarf spheroidal companions have been discovered around m31 .",
    "interestingly , @xmath0 of these reside in a vast , thin plane .",
    "this plane is 400 kpc in diameter , has a scale height of only 14 kpc , and shows evidence for co - rotation ( @xcite ) .",
    "such thin and extended planes are not common in nature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading some to suggest that these dwarf galaxies have not formed within their own dark matter halos , but instead have formed tidally , out of dense streams of gas produced by a gas rich merger in m31 @xmath1   gyrs ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "if this were the case , one might expect to observe significant differences in the properties of the on- and off - plane dwarf galaxies , as the on - plane dsphs would form much later than their off - plane counterparts , from pre - enriched gas , and without a dark matter component .    in @xcite , we investigated the observable properties of all m31 dsphs using imaging and kinematic data taken for their individual stars .",
    "we compared the sizes , luminosities , chemistries and masses of the on- and off - plane dsphs with well established relations in these parameter spaces derived for milky way dsphs , including the size - luminosity relation ( @xcite ) , the luminosity - metallicity relation ( @xcite ) , and the mass - luminosity relation ( @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show the results of these comparisons . in all cases , we found no statistical evidence for any differences between the on- and off - plane dsphs , nor from their milky way counterparts .",
    "as such there is _ no evidence _ that the dsphs within the m31 plane experienced a dramatically different evolutionary history from those that formed within their own dark matter halos off the plane .",
    "this finding is further bolstered by the measured star formation histories for m31 dsphs from @xcite , where dsphs on and off the plane are found to host significant old stellar populations , and have similarly extended star formation histories .",
    "scatter about this relationship .",
    "both independent fits to the on- and off - plane dwarf galaxies , and ks tests show no statistical difference in how the on - plane , off - plane and milky way dsphs populate this parameter space . * centre : * the luminosity - metallicity relationship for milky way dsphs ( dashed line and cyan band ) as measured by @xcite .",
    "again , there is no statistical difference between how on - plane , off - plane and milky way dsphs populate this parameter space , implying they have all evolved under similar conditions . *",
