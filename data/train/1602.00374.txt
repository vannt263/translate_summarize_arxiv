    "medicine is a new healthcare paradigm that aims to move beyond the current  one - size - fits - all \" approach to medicine and , instead , takes into account the features and traits of individual patients : their genes , micro - biomes , environments , and lifestyles @xcite-@xcite .",
    "vast attention has been recently dedicated to research in personalized medicine that builds on data science and machine learning techniques in order to customize healthcare policies .",
    "for instance , the white house has led the  precision medicine initiative \" @xcite , which is scheduled for discussion in the american association for the advancement of science annual meeting for the year 2016 @xcite .",
    "breast cancer screening is one example for a healthcare process that can potentially benefit from personalization .",
    "screening is carried out in order to diagnose a woman with no apparent symptoms in a timely manner @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the screening process entails both benefits and costs that can differ from one patient to another @xcite , which signals the need for personalized screening policies that balance such benefits and costs in a customized manner .    in this paper",
    ", we present confidentcare : a clinical decision support system ( cdss ) that is capable of learning and implementing a personalized screening policy for breast cancer .",
    "the personalized screening policy is learned from data in the electronic health record ( ehr ) , and is aimed to issue recommendations for different women with different features on which when should they take screening tests , which specific tests to take , and in what sequence .",
    "confidentcare discovers subgroups of  similar \" patients from the ehr data , and learns how to construct a screening policy that will work well for each subgroup with a high level of confidence",
    ". our approach can provide significant gains in terms of both the cost - efficiency , and the accuracy of the screening process as compared to other ",
    "one - size - fits - all \" approaches adopted by current clinical practice guidelines ( cpgs ) that apply the same policy on all patients .",
    "while breast cancer screening is believed to reduce mortality rates @xcite , it is associated with the risks of  overscreening \" , which leads to unnecessary costs , and  overdiagnosis \" , which corresponds to false positive diagnoses that lead the patients to receive unnecessary treatments @xcite .",
    "while different patients have different levels of risks for developing breast cancer @xcite-@xcite ; different tests have different monetary costs , and different levels of accuracy that depend on the features of the patient @xcite ; common cpgs are aimed at populations , and are not typically tailored to specific individuals or significant subgroups @xcite-@xcite .",
    "being designed to work well on  average \" for a population of patients , following cpgs may lead to overscreening or overdiagnosis for specific subgroups of patients , such as young women at a high risk of developing breast cancer , or healthy older women who may have a relatively longer expected lifespan @xcite .",
    "moreover , some screening tests may work well for some patients , but not for others ( e.g. a mammogram test will exhibit low accuracy for patients with high breast density @xcite ) , which can either lead to  overdiagnosis \" or poor tumor detection performance . migrating from the  one - size - fits - all \" screening and diagnosis policies adopted by cpgs to more individualized policies that recognizes and approaches different subgroups of patients is the essence of applying the personalized medicine paradigm to the breast cancer clinical environment @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "confidentcare is a computer - aided clinical decision support system that assists clinicians in making decisions on which ( sequence of ) screening tests a woman should take given her features .",
    "confidentcare resorts to the realm of supervised learning in order to learn a personalized screening policy that is tailored to subgroups of patients .",
    "in particular , the system recognizes different subgroups of patients , learns the policy that fits each subgroup , and prompts recommendations for screening tests and clinical decisions that if followed will lead to a desired accuracy requirement with a desired level of confidence .",
    "[ figu2 ] offers a system - level illustration for confidentcare .",
    "the system operates in two stages : an offline stage in which it learns from the ehr data how to cluster patients , and what policy to follow for every cluster , and an execution stage in which it applies learned policy to every woman by first matching her with the closest cluster of patients in the ehr , and then approach her with the policy associated with that cluster .",
    "the main features of confidentcare are :    * confidentcare discovers a set of patients subgroups .",
    "given certain accuracy requirements and confidence levels set by the clinicians , confidentcare ensures that every subgroup of patients would experience a diagnostic accuracy , and a confidence level on that accuracy , that meets these requirements .",
    "thus , unlike cpgs that perform well only on average , confidentcare ensures that performance is reasonable for every discovered subgroups of patients . *",
    "confidentcare ensures cost - efficiency , i.e. patients are not overscreened , and the sequence of recommended screening tests minimizes the screening costs .",
    "we show that confidentcare can improve the screening cost - efficiency when compared with cpgs , can offer performance guarantees for individual subgroups of patients with a desired level of confidence , and outperforms the  one - size - fits - all \" approaches in terms of the accuracy of clinical decisions .",
    "moreover , we show that confidentcare can achieve a finer granularity in its learned policy with respect to the patients feature space when it is provided with more training data .",
    "our results emphasize the value of personalization in breast cancer clinical environments , and represent a first step towards individualizing breast cancer screening , diagnosis and treatment .",
    "while medical studies investigated the feasibility , potential and impact of applying the concepts of personalized medicine in the breast cancer clinical environments @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite@xcite , none of these works provided specific tools or methods for building a personalized healthcare environment .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , it has been shown that cpgs , which recommend screening tests only based on the age ranges , such as the european society for medical oncology ( esmo ) cpg and the american cancer society ( acs ) cpg , are not cost - efficient for many subgroups of patients , where cost - efficiency was measured in terms of  costs per quality - adjusted life - year \" , and the authors recommended that screening should be personalized on the basis of a patient s age , breast density , history of breast biopsy , and the family history of breast cancer .",
    "similar results were portrayed in other medical studies @xcite-@xcite , all suggesting that personalization using dimensions other than the age can yield more cost efficiency .",
    "personalizing breast cancer screening is envisioned to not only improve the cost - efficiency of the process , but also to improve the diagnostic accuracy .",
    "this is because current cpgs do not consider the individual features of a woman when recommending screening tests ; thus decisions on which a woman needs to take an additional screening tests , or proceed to a diagnostic test ( biopsies ) are not tailored to the woman s individual features .",
    "therefore , false negative diagnoses rates reported by clinicians who follow cpgs reflect the average accuracy over all the population of patients , but cpgs give no guarantee that the diagnostic accuracy and the associated confidence levels of their guidelines are reasonable for every subgroup of  similar \" patients @xcite@xcite ; such subgroups can be significantly different in their traits and hence may require being dealt with via different screening and diagnosis policies .",
    "+      perhaps the work that relates most to this paper is that on dynamic treatment regimes ( dtrs ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a dtr is typically a sequence of decision rules , with one rule per stage of clinical intervention , where each rule maps up - to - date patient information to a recommended treatment @xcite .",
    "dtrs are constructed via reinforcement learning techniques , such as q - learning , where the goal is to find an  optimal treatment policy \" : a sequential mapping of the patient s information to recommended treatments that would maximize the patient s long term reward .",
    "however , these works profoundly differ from the setting we consider in the following aspects : dtrs are only focused on recommending treatments and do not consider screening and diagnoses ; cost - efficiency is not considered in the design of dtr policies since they only consider the  value of information \" in recommending treatments ; and finally , while confidence measures can be computed for policies in dtrs @xcite , the policies themselves are not designed in a way that guarantees to the clinician a certain level of reliability for every subgroup of patients .",
    "+      screening and diagnostic clinical decisions typically involve  purchasing costly information \" for the patients , which relates to the paradigm of active learning @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we note that in our setting , clinicians  purchase \" costly features of the patients rather than purchasing unobserved labels , which makes our setting profoundly different from the conventional active learning framework @xcite-@xcite .",
    "classification problems in which some features are costly are referred to as  active classification \" @xcite , or  active sensing \" @xcite .",
    "such problems have been addressed in the context of medical diagnosis in @xcite-@xcite , but all these works correspond to solving an unconstrained optimization problem that targets the whole population , for which no personalized accuracy or confidence guarantees can be claimed .",

    "next , in section iii , we propose the confidentcare algorithm . in section iv , we carry out various experiments using a dataset collected at the ucla medical center in order to highlight the advantages of confidentcare .",
    "finally , in section v , we draw our conclusions .",
    "confidentcare is a computer - aided clinical decision support system that learns a personalized screening policy from the ehr data . by a",
    " personalized screening policy \" we mean : a procedure for recommending an action for the clinician to take based on the individual features of the patient , and the outcomes of the screening tests taken by that patient .",
    "an action can be : letting the patient take an additional screening test , proceed to a diagnostic test ( e.g. biopsy ) , or just recommend a regular follow - up .",
    "the tasks that confidentcare carries out can be summarized as follows :    * * discover the granularity of the patient s population * : the system is provided with training data from the ehr that summarizes previous experiences of patients in terms of the screening tests they took , their test results , and their diagnoses . from such data",
    ", confidentcare recognizes different _ subgroups _ or _ clusters _ of patients who are similar in their features and can be approached using the same screening policy . * * learn the best policy for each subgroup of patients * : having discovered the distinct subgroups of patients from the training data , confidentcare finds the best screening policy for each of these subgroups ; by a ",
    "best \" policy we mean : a policy that minimizes the screening costs while maintaining a desired level of diagnostic accuracy , with a high level of confidence that is set by the clinicians .",
    "the more training data provided to confidentcare , the more  granular \" is the learned policy in the sense that more subgroups of patients can be discovered , and thus the extent of personalization and precision would increase consequently . * * identify the incoming patients subgroups and execute their personalized policies * : after being trained , confidentcare handles an incoming patient by observing her features , identifying the subgroup to which she belongs , and decides the appropriate screening policy that needs to be followed for her .",
    "confidentcare can be thought of as an algorithm that stratifies the pool of patients into clusters , and automatically generates multiple cpgs , one for each cluster , in order to issue the best customized guidelines to follow for each cluster .",
    "the algorithm ensures that the accuracy of clinical decisions for each cluster satisfy a certain requirement with a certain confidence level .",
    "patients features fall into two categories : _ personal features _ , and _ screening features_. personal features are observable at no cost , and are accessible without the need for taking any screening tests , for that they are provided by the patient herself via a questionnaire , etc .",
    "the personal features include numerical and categorical features such as : age , age at menarche , number of previous biopsies , breast density , age at first child birth , and the family history @xcite .",
    "screening tests reveal another set of costly features for the patient , which we call : the screening features .",
    "the screening features comprise the radiological assessment of breast images , usually encoded in the form of bi - rads ( breast imaging report and data system ) scores @xcite .",
    "the bi - rads scores take values from the set @xmath1 the interpretation of which is given in table ii .",
    "bi - rads scores of 3 or above are usually associated with followup tests or biopsy .",
    "the descriptions of all the personal and screening features are shown in table iii .",
    "confidentcare considers three possible multimedia - based screening tests in the screening stage , which represent three different imaging modalities : mammogram ( mg ) , ultrasound ( us ) , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .",
    "every screening test is associated with different costs and risks , which are functions of the patients personal features .",
    "we consider a generic cost function that incorporates both the misclassification costs in addition to the monetary costs ( the detailed cost model is provided in the next subsection ) @xcite .",
    "other screening features can also include genetic ones , yet we do not consider these in this paper since such features are not revealed by the screening tests under consideration .",
    "however , confidentcare algorithm together with the theoretical framework tackled in this section can handle any generic class of features and tests , including genetic tests .",
    "confidentcare recommends an action upon observing the outcome of a specific screening test",
    ". the actions can either be : recommend a regular ( 1 year ) followup , recommend a diagnostic test ( biopsy ) , or an intermediate recommendation for an additional ( costly ) screening test ( short - ter followup ) .",
    "the final action recommended by the screening policy is either to proceed to a diagnostic test , or to take a regular followup ( screening ) test after 1 or 2 years .",
    "the accuracy measures that we adopt in this paper are : the false positive rate ( fpr ) and the false negative rate ( fnr ) , which are defined as follows : the fpr is the probability that a patient with a negative true diagnosis ( benign or no tumor ) is recommended to proceed to a diagnostic test , whereas the fnr is the probability that a patient with a positive true diagnosis ( malignant tumor ) is recommended to take a regular followup screening test @xcite .",

    "we describe the confidentcare algorithm , which implements those tasks using supervised learning .",
    "the algorithm requires the following inputs from the clinician :    * a training set comprising a set of patients with their associated features , screening tests taken , and their true diagnoses . * a restrictions on the maximum tolerable fnr . * a desired confidence level on the fnr in the diagnoses issued by the system .",
    "provided by the inputs above , confidentcare operates through two basic stages :    * * offline policy construction stage : * given the training data and all the system inputs , confidentcare implements an iterative algorithm to cluster the patients personal feature space , and then learns a separate _ active classifier _ for each cluster of patients .",
    "each active classifier associated with a cluster of patients is designed such that it minimizes the overall screening costs , and meets the fnr and confidence requirements .",
    "the algorithm runs iteratively until it maximizes the number of patient clusters for which there exist active classifiers that can guarantee the performance and confidence requirements set by the clinician , thereby ensuring the maximum level of personalization , i.e. ensure that the space of all patients personal features is segmented into the finer possible set of partitions , where the performance requirements hold for each of such partitions .",
    "+ * * policy execution stage : * having learned a policy based on the training data , confidentcare executes the policy by observing the personal features of an incoming patient , associate her with a cluster ( and consequently , an already learned active classifier ) , and then the classifier handles the patient by recommending screening tests and observing the test outcomes , until a final action is recommended .",
    "[ figu2 ] illustrates the components and operation of confidentcare .",
    "in the _ offline policy construction stage _ , confidentcare is provided with training data from the ehr , the maximum tolerable fnr , and the desired level of confidence .",
    "confidentcare runs an iterative algorithm that clusters the patients personal feature space , and learns the best active classifier ( the most cost - efficient classifier that meets the fnr accuracy and confidence requirements ) for each cluster . in the _ policy execution stage _ , confidentcare observes the personal features of the incoming patient , associates her with a patients cluster , and then recommends a sequence of screening tests to that patient until it issues a final recommendation .",
    "for instance , assume that the set of personal features are given by a tuple _",
    "( age , breast density , number of first degree relatives with breast cancer)_. a patient with a personal features vector ( 55 , 40@xmath4,0 ) is approached by confidentcare .",
    "the system associates the patient with a certain cluster of patients that it has learned from the ehr data .",
    "let the best policy for screening patients in that cluster , as computed by confidentcare , is to start with mammogram .",

    "if the bi - rads score was higher , say a score of 4a , then the system recommends an additional imaging test , e.g. an mri , and then observes the bi - rads score of the mri before issuing further recommendations .",

    "we denote the space of all possible screening test observations as @xmath31 .",
    "confidentcare issues recommendations and decisions based on both the fully observed personal features @xmath32 , and a partially observed version of @xmath29 , which we denote as @xmath33 the screening feature vector @xmath29 can indeed be fully observed , but this would be the case only if all the screening tests were carried out for a specific patient .    in order to clarify the different types of features and their observability , consider the following illustrative example .",
    "assume that we only have two personal features : the age and the number of first degree relatives who developed breast cancer , whereas we have three screening tests @xmath34 .",
    "that is , we have that @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "initially , confidentcare only observes the personal features , e.g. observing a feature vector @xmath37 means that the patient s age is 42 years , she has one first degree relative with breast cancer , and she took no screening tests . based on the learned policy , confidentcare then decides which test should the patient take .",
    "for instance , if the policy decides that the patient should take a mammogram test , then the feature vector can then be updated to be @xmath38 , which means that the bi - rads score of the mammogram is 2 .",
    "confidentcare can then decide what action should be recommended given that the bi - rads score of the mammogram is 2 : classify the patient as one who needs to proceed to a diagnostic test , or classify the patient as one who just needs to take a regular followup test in a 1 year period , or request an additional screening test result in order to be able to issue a confident classification for the patient .      the process described in the previous subsection is a typical active classification process : a classifier aims to issue either a positive or a negative diagnosis ( biopsy or regular followup ) for patients based on their costly features ( test outcomes ) .",
    "such a classifier is active in the sense that it can query the clinician for costly feature information rather than passively dealing with a given chunk of data @xcite .",
    "this setting should not be confused with conventional _ active learning _ , where labels ( and not features ) are the costly piece of information which the classifier may need to purchase @xcite@xcite .",
    "in the following , we formally define an _",
    "active classifier_.    * ( active classifier ) * an active classifier is a hypothesis ( function ) @xmath39    thus , the active classifier either recommends a test in @xmath27 , or issues a final recommendation @xmath24 , where @xmath40 corresponds to recommending a biopsy ( positive screening test result ) and @xmath41 is recommending a regular followup ( negative screening test result ) , given the current , partially observed screening feature vector @xmath42 . whenever a test is taken , the screening feature vector is updated , based upon which the classifier either issues a new recommendation .",
    "for instance , the range of the function @xmath43 in our setting can be @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 . if @xmath47 ( or @xmath17 ) , then the classifier issues -with high confidence on the accuracy- a final recommendation for a biopsy or a regular followup for the patient with a screening feature vector @xmath42 , whereas if @xmath48 then the classifier recommends the patient with a screening feature vector @xmath49 to take a mammogram test . note that if @xmath50 then the classifier recommends no tests for any patient .          designing an active classifier for the breast cancer screening and diagnosis problem under consideration can not rely on conventional loss functions , such as the @xmath51 loss function .",
    "this is because the classification problem involves costly decision making under uncertainty , and different types of diagnostic errors ( false negatives and false positives ) have very different consequences .",
    "hence , our notion of learning needs to be _ decision - theoretic _ , and new objective functions and learning algorithms need to be defined and formulated .",
    "we use an _ inductive bias _ approach for designing the active classifier ; we restrict our learning algorithm to pick one hypothesis @xmath43 from a specific hypothesis class @xmath52 .",
    "that is , we compensate our lack of knowledge of the stationary distribution @xmath21 by inducing a prior knowledge on the set of possible hypothesis that the learning algorithm can output : a common approach for designing _ agnostic _",
    "learners @xcite .",
    "unlike the conventional supervised learning paradigm which picks a hypothesis that minimizes a loss function , we will design a learning algorithm that picks a hypothesis from @xmath52 , such that the overall cost of screening is minimized , while maintaining the fnr to be below a predefined threshold , with a desired level of confidence ; a common design objective for breast cancer clinical systems @xcite .",
    "the screening cost involves both the monetary costs of the screening tests , as well as the _ misclassification cost _ reflected by the fpr .",
    "the fnr experienced by the patients when using an active classifier @xmath43 is given by @xmath53 whereas the fpr is given by @xmath54 that is , the fnr is the probability that classifier @xmath43 recommends a regular followup ( outputs a @xmath16 ) for a screening feature vector @xmath29 , when the patient takes all the recommended tests , given that the true diagnosis was @xmath17 , whereas the fpr is the probability that the classifier recommends a biopsy ( outputs a @xmath17 ) when the true diagnosis is @xmath16",
    ". both types of error are very different in terms of their implications , and one can easily see that the fnr is more crucial , since it corresponds to misdiagnosing a patient with breast cancer as being healthy @xcite .",
    "thus , the system must impose restrictions on the maximum tolerable fnr . on the other hand ,",
    "the fpr is considered as a misclassification cost that we aim at minimizing given a constraint on the fnr @xcite .",

    "[ sm4 ] represents just a single realization of confidentcare , and thus it does not reveal the amount of confidence we have in the algorithm being satisfying the fnr constraint with a high probability . in order to verify the confidence level in the policy constructed by confidentcare , we run the algorithm for 100 runs and see the fraction of time where the fnr in the testing set for any partition exceeds the threshold @xmath102 .",
    "it can be seen that this is bounded by the specified confidence level @xmath103 .",
    "we compare the performance of confidentcare with that of the current clinical guidelines in order to assess the value of personalization in terms of cost - efficiency .",
    "we compare the monetary cost of confidentcare with that of the american cancer society ( acs ) screening guidelines issued in 2015 @xcite .",
    "the reason for selecting this specific cpg is that it already applies a coarse form of risk stratification : low , average and high risk women are recommended to take different sets of tests . in fig .",
    "[ sm7 ] , we plot the distribution of the normalized monetary cost of confidentcare together with that of the acs over different levels of risk . it is clear that confidentcare can save a significant amount of screening costs since it supports a finer stratification of the patients , and thus recommends screening tests only to patients who need them based on both their features the outcomes of the previous tests that they may have taken .",
    "the comparison in fig .",
    "[ sm7 ] is indeed subject to the selection of @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the more we relax the fnr and confidence constraints , the more savings we attain for the monetary costs .",
    "the cost - efficiency of confidentcare depends on the selection of @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which can be set by clinicians or institutions , and based on which the added value of a personalized system can be assessed .    finally , we compare the accuracy of confidentcare with that of a single decision tree of tests that is designed in a ",
    "one - size - fits - all \" fashion .",
    "in particular , we build a tree of tests using the conventional c4.5 algorithm @xcite , and then compare its performance with that of confidentcare with respect to every partition found by confidentcare . from fig .",
    "[ sm8 ] , we can see that for the same realization illustrated in fig .",
    "[ sm4 ] and [ sm6 ] , both approaches have a comparable fnr , but confidentcare outperforms a single decision tree in terms of the fpr for all the 4 partitions .",
    "this is because confidentcare deals differently with women belonging to different subgroups as shown in fig .",
    "[ sm6 ] , i.e. for instance women in partition 2 are not recommended to take any tests . in other words ,",
    "confidentcare avoids recommending unnecessary tests , which reduces the rate of false positives .",
    "the average values of the fnr and fpr for 50 runs of confidentcare and a single decision tree are reported in table [ perftable ] , where a gain of @xmath214 with respect to the fpr is reported .",
    "single c4.5 decision tree & 0.0501 & 0.0488 .",
    "+ confidentcare & 0.0512 & 0.037 .",
    "+    [ perftable ]          the screening policy considered in this paper was concerned with managing the short - term screening procedure , i.e. the policy was recommending a sequence of screening tests for the patient based on the outcomes of those tests , and such tests are expected to be taken in a relatively short time interval .",
    "our framework can be extended to design policies that are concerned with the long - term patient outcomes , and are capable of not only recommend tests to the patient , but also recommend the frequency with which screening should be carried out for different subgroups of patients . to see how our framework can be extended to handle such a setting , we plot the risk of developing breast cancer over time for the representative agents ( centroids ) of 4 clusters constructed in one realization of the algorithm in fig .",
    "each cluster exhibits a different rate of risk growth over time , i.e. for instance while clusters 3 and 4 in fig . [ sm9 ] comprise women of almost the same age , patients in cluster 3 develop a risk for breast cancer more quickly than patients in cluster 4 due to other factors ( e.g. family history ) .",
    "thus , confidentcare can be modified to not only recommend a sequence of tests to patients in different clusters , but also to compute the optimal frequency of screening ( steps over time for which the patient need to be regularly screened ) that would maximize a long - term objective function .",
    "intuitively , the frequency of screening would depend on the slope of the risk assessment over time , i.e. clusters with steeper slopes would demand more frequent screening .",
    "our framework is well suited to capture such a setting , and the confidentcare algorithm can be modified to construct a screening policy that maximizes long - term outcomes with high levels of confidence .",
    "in this paper , we presented confidentcare : a clinical decision support system that learns a personalized screening policy from the electronic health data record",
    ". confidentcare operates by stratifying the space of a woman ? features and learning cost - effective , and accurate screening policy that is tailored to those features and are accurate with a high - level of confidence .",
    "confidentcare algorithm iteratively stratifies the patients feature space into disjoint clusters and learns active classifiers associated with each cluster .",
    "we have shown that the proposed algorithm has the potential of improving the cost efficiency and accuracy of the screening process compared to current clinical practice guidelines , and state - of - the - art algorithms that do not consider personalization .",
