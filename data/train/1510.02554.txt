    "the virtual knots @xcite and welded knots @xcite are two extensions of classical knots in the euclidian @xmath0-space . in classical knot theory , invariants and local moves play important roles from the algebraic and geometric viewpoints .",
    "several algebraic invariants of classical knots are extended to those of virtual or welded knots .",
    "for example , the jones polynomial is an invariant of a virtual knot but not that of a welded knot , and the knot group and knot quandle are invariants of a virtual knot and a welded knot both . as for local moves on virtual knots , there are many results in relation to finite type invariants . in particular ,",
    "a replacement of a classical crossing with a virtual crossing is used in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider three kinds of classical local moves called the _ crossing change _ ,",
    "the _ delta move _ , and the _ sharp move _ as shown in figure  [ fig001 ] .",
    "these local moves are known as unknotting operations for classical knots @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the crossing change on a virtual knot is not an unknotting operation ; for example , the value of the miyazawa ( or arrow ) polynomial @xcite at @xmath1 detects the non - triviality of a virtual knot up to crossing changes . since a delta move and a sharp move",
    "are presented by crossing changes , neither of the moves is an unknotting operation for virtual knots ( cf .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that the three local moves are unknotting operations for welded knots in the following sense .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we prove that any descending diagram presents a trivial welded knot , which induces theorem  [ thm11 ] . in sections  [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , we prove that a replacement of a classical crossing with a welded crossing is accomplished by delta moves and sharp moves , respectively , which induces theorems  [ thm12 ] and [ thm13 ] .",
    "a _ welded knot diagram _ is a circle immersed in the plane @xmath10 with transverse double points which are divided into two classes called _ classical crossings _ and _ welded crossings_. a classical crossing has over / under - information such that a small segment is removed from one of the paths intersecting at the crossing , and a welded crossing is indicated by putting a small circle on it .",
