    "historically reserved to the engineering community  @xcite , granular materials recently emerged as a new field of study for physicists  @xcite : a state of matter that is not classifiable according to the traditional ternary  solid , liquid or gas and requires scientists to rethink the foundations of statistical physics and thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the first theories of granular materials were motivated primarily by the need to predict the creep motion of soils and their stability properties .",
    "inspired by continuum theories of plasticity , these approaches were restricted to quasi - static deformation and incipient failure  @xcite . in physics ,",
    "initial progress came in understanding dilute granular materials with the development of kinetic theory  @xcite .",
    "but kinetic theory is based on the assumption that interactions between grains occur during instantaneous binary collisions , a condition that is realized by very few `` rapid '' flows outside the laboratory .",
    "traditional approaches thus leave us with little understanding of the elementary mechanisms of deformation in granular materials .",
    "it is no wonder that the elaboration of physically inspired constitutive equations for granular materials is currently facing a collection of controversial issues which challenge its most fundamental aspects .",
    "common points of contention include : ( i ) the relevant features of the grain - grain interaction_e.g . _ hertzian versus hard - sphere repulsion  @xcite ; ( ii ) the domain of applicability of kinetic theories ,  @xcite ; ( iii ) the observation and micromechanical origin of bagnold scaling in dense flows  @xcite ; ( iv ) the plausible need to formulate `` non - local '' constitutive equations  @xcite due to the existence of chain forces  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties about these questions have fueled a wealth of theoretical models .",
    "some models posit that frustrated rotation plays a preeminent role in jamming  @xcite .",
    "many models propose extensions of kinetic theory by using either granular temperature  @xcite , introducing strongly density - dependent viscosities  @xcite , or incorporating a quasi - static stress at the internal friction angle of the material  @xcite .",
    "other models are based on the introduction of chain - forces  @xcite , activated processes  @xcite , `` granular eddies ''  @xcite , coexisting liquid and solid microphases in a ginzburg - landau formulation  @xcite , or spots of free - volume associated to cooperative diffusion  @xcite .",
    "several of the above - mentioned models conjecture jamming mechanisms  frustrated rotations , chain forces , granular eddies  which are so specific to granular materials that they do not allow for connection with jamming in other materials .",
    "our approach rests on the viewpoint that , since jamming is observed in many amorphous systems , it is likely that it has a common origin .",
    "it was thus proposed  @xcite that a rescaling of the dynamics of perfectly hard granular materials would make it possible to map their properties onto more typical glass formers .",
    "building on the analogy between granular materials and metallic glasses then provides a local mechanism of jamming on the basis of the shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory of plasticity  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present paper is both to discuss some of the microscopic assumptions underlying the construction of constitutive equations for granular materials and test the specific predictions of the stz theory formulation of such equations  @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the following expectations concerning the four points of contention identified above : ( i ) major properties of dense granular flows can be captured by perfectly hard grains ; ( ii ) jamming involves variations of the frictional stress in regimes where the collisional contributions those predicted by kinetic theory are negligible ; ( iii ) for flows of perfectly hard grains , bagnold s scaling is relevant at all densities and arises from an invariance in the equations of motion ; and ( iv ) the rheology of dense granular materials is local in a sense to be defined further .",
    "indeed , ( i ) a recent work by campbell has shown  convincingly to us  that most natural and experimental flows occur in a regime of strain rates where",
    "grains can be considered as hard - spheres  @xcite .",
    "although this question may still be debated , we will take this for granted and restrict our study to a material composed of perfectly hard grains .",
    "( ii ) the breakdown of kinetic theory in dense flows has now been characterized in several numerical and experimental studies  @xcite and indicates that jamming is associated with changes in the contribution of long - lasting contacts to the stress tensor , not the collisional contribution .",
    "we will take this idea for granted in the present work , but we do believe that a quantitative analysis of this statement is needed and will devote a future paper to this question .",
    "( iii ) we will show , following  @xcite that in the case of perfectly hard grains , bagnold s scaling holds for any density .",
    "assumption ( iv ) is strongly inspired by the works by aranson , tsimring and coworkers , who have shown that a ginzburg - landau formulation of a fluid - solid mixture  @xcite could account for important properties of granular flows .",
    "this suggests that a local formulation of granular rheology , coupled to hydrodynamic equations , can be sufficient to account for a large part of the phenomena observed in dense granular flows .",
    "however , no numerical study has been specifically devoted to this question .",
    "therefore , we will first study whether dense granular flows can be described as a local phenomenon , governed by local hydrodynamic equations , or whether granular flows must be treated non - locally , relying on the emergence of long - range correlations through mechanisms such as force chains .",
    "for this purpose we have implemented contact dynamics simulations of sheared granular materials in two different configurations : ( i ) simple shear in a periodic cell and ( ii ) thick flows of granular material down an incline plane .",
    "we will show that the measurements obtained in either configuration can be extrapolated to the other .",
    "next we follow falk and langer  @xcite and test for the consistency of the stz picture of material deformation advocated by these authors .",
    "our observation provides further grounding for the analogy between granular materials and common glass - formers and direct support for the relevance of stz theory to granular materials . a review of the stz constitutive equations for granular flows will follow and finally a fit of the theory with our numerical data .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present equations of motion in the mathematical limit of perfectly hard grains .",
    "we discuss the invariance properties of the equations of motion and how these properties are related to bagnold s scaling .",
    "we also discuss why the results for perfectly hard grains are applicable to natural and experimental granular materials . in section",
    "iii we construct our numerical test , provide algorithmic details on the contact dynamics method , and compare the rheology of a dense granular materials in a periodic cell and down an incline plane .",
    "finally , in section  iv , we present falk and langer s stz theory , show how it adapts to granular materials , and conclude with fits of our data .",
    "when grains are dry  so that no water bridges induce attraction  and of size larger than the micrometer scale  so that no electrostatic interaction intervenes  their interaction is purely repulsive . the interaction results from the elastic deformation of grains at contact and the dissipation of energy via friction and collisions .",
    "the complexity of this interaction motivates our first question : which properties of the grain - grain interaction contribute to any particular macroscopic observation ? in some instances , details of the grain - grain interaction seem critical : for example , the hertzian repulsion  @xcite is essential to understand the acoustic properties of granular materials  @xcite .",
    "numerical implementations of granular materials have thus relied on more or less elaborate models of the grain - grain interaction  @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with dense flows of granular materials and , in particular , flows down inclines as found in the experiments by pouliquen  @xcite and numerics by silbert and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "for these dense granular flows a recent study by campbell helps us assess the importance of the elastic ( soft ) part of the repulsive potential  @xcite versus the limit in which grains appear as perfectly hard spheres .",
    "campbell presented a detailed analysis of the different flow regimes obtained in a three dimensional simple shear simulation of dense granular flows when varying the stiffness @xmath0 of the repulsion , the shear rate @xmath1 , and the mass density @xmath2 .",
    "he found that the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the grain size , dictates the character of the flow .",
    "this quantity is directly related to a mach number which involves the ratio of the shear velocity @xmath5 over the sound speed @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "the hard - sphere limit corresponds to the situation where sound waves travel very fast compared to the motion induced by the shear flow .",
    "this is the limit of very small mach number , or small shear rates .",
    "specifically , in the numerics by campbell , this limit is reached for mach numbers below @xmath8 . since the sound speed in granular materials is of order 100 m/s ,",
    "if we assume a grain size of order 1 mm , the mach number is expressible as @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , in order to be in the limit where grains behave as if they are perfectly stiff , it suffices to restrain oneself to shear rates below 1000s@xmath10 .",
    "most experimental and natural situations occur at shear rates far below this limiting value and we can conclude that most flows of granulates are in the limit where the soft part of the repulsion is entirely masked by the steric exclusion . to study these flows",
    "it is sufficient to consider properties of perfectly hard grains . in the following sections we explore how the mathematical limit of perfectly hard spheres gives insight into fundamental processes which relate to most all experimental shear flows .",
    "the motion of @xmath11 spherical grains in a @xmath12-dimensional granular material is determined by newton s equations for the positions @xmath13 , angular orientations @xmath14 , momenta @xmath15 and angular velocities @xmath16 : @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents an external force such as gravity , @xmath20 represents a contact force on grain @xmath21 by grain @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the unit normal vector pointing from grain @xmath21 to grain @xmath22 , @xmath24 is the radius of grain @xmath21 , and @xmath25 is the moment of inertia .",
    "these equations must be complemented with a prescription for the contact forces . in the hard sphere",
    "limit these contact forces are determined self - consistently by the conditions that ( i ) there is no penetration between grain  a force is instantaneously created upon contact to impede penetration and remains non - zero until the contact is broken  and ( ii ) by the friction law which couples to rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "important properties of granular materials arise directly from an invariance of the equations of motion  ( [ newtonseqns ] ,  [ rotnewtonseqns ] ) .",
    "we now spend some time studying these properties and assessing their consequences for macroscopic observations , in particular bagnold s scaling .",
    "the success of kinetic theory came in a large part from its ability to account for the scaling between stress @xmath26 and strain rate @xmath1 ( @xmath27 ) first observed by bagnold in dense granular materials  @xcite . in bagnold",
    "s experiment , the strain rate was set and the stress measured .",
    "bagnold justified this behavior by assuming that the stress measured in his experiments resulted solely from binary collisions : the frequency of collisions and momentum change per collision are each proportional to the shear rate , therefore the stress is proportional to the square of the shear rate .",
    "recent observations have complicated bagnold s original assessment . on the one hand , the observations by bagnold have been criticized : they may have arisen from a secondary instability of the granular flow in his shear cell  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "bagnold s scaling has been directly observed by measuring shear stress and strain rate profiles in numerical simulations of granular flows down inclines  @xcite , and is found to be consistent with experimental observations of the average flow rate in the same geometry  @xcite .",
    "although kinetic theory predicts an exponent which agrees with the power law dependence of bagnold s scaling , the derivation relies on the assumption that all interactions between grains occur through binary collisions .",
    "this assumption is applicable to dilute flows but is not upheld for dense flows , such as those originally studied by bagnold .",
    "a new argument must be formulated for the dense flow regime .",
    "we contend that in both the dense and `` rapid '' flow regimes , bagnold s scaling arises from a very fundamental invariance of newton s equations in the hard sphere limit .",
    "this invariance does not require any of the assumptions of kinetic theory to hold .",
    "namely , for a granular material free from external forces , the time evolution will obey equations  ( [ newtonseqns ] , [ rotnewtonseqns ] ) with @xmath28 .",
    "if we now rescale the contact forces by a scalar value @xmath29 and simultaneously rescale the time @xmath30 , then newton s equations are transformed to read : @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this form for newton s equations is identical to  ( [ newtonseqns ] ) and  ( [ rotnewtonseqns ] ) with new values for the momenta and angular velocities .    under the rescaling of contact forces and time ,",
    "the positions and angular orientations remain unchanged , while the velocities are changed in accordance with the time rescaling .",
    "if we were to watch a movie of one granular flow where the grains have initial velocities @xmath15 , @xmath16 and watch another movie at half the speed where the initial velocities are doubled @xmath35 , @xmath36 , the two movies would look exactly the same in the hard sphere limit .",
    "the difference in the dynamics is that the contact forces measured in the second movie would be @xmath37 times larger than those in the first .",
    "this invariance is a property of _ perfectly hard grains _ which must hold in the inertial regime .",
    "this includes the regime infinitely close to jamming , where multi - body interactions dominate collisional terms and the basic assumptions of kinetic theory fail . in an experiment ,",
    "this scaling breaks down only when it is no longer appropriate to model the experimental system by perfectly hard grains .",
    "relying on the arguments of campbell introduced earlier  @xcite , we can conclude that most experimental granular flows are in the regime where it is appropriate to model the system by hard grains .",
    "this invariance also holds for any value of the restitution and friction coefficients .",
    "the separation of time scales for dissipation and shear is not a necessary condition for the invariance to be upheld .",
    "the reason is that dissipation occurs at contacts between grains : dissipative processes are correlated to the motion of grains , hence the rate of dissipative processes scales with @xmath1 .      because the positions and angular orientations of grains are invariant to a simultaneous change in time and force scales ,",
    "the path that a granular material takes in configuration space is also invariant : only the speed along this path is altered .",
    "therefore , the path that a granular material takes in configuration space can be separated from the rate at which events occur along that path .",
    "this observation leads to a natural definition of granular temperature @xmath38 : the rate at which microscopic events occur on the configuration space path is defined as @xmath39 ( the average grain size @xmath40 is inserted so that @xmath38 has units of velocity squared ) .",
    "these microscopic events are not necessarily collisions , but can also be understood as force fluctuations or minute displacement of grains allowing for propagation of `` hard - sphere '' noise .",
    "the invariance is directly related to the structure of newton s equations and the existence of inertial terms  or accordingly , to the fact that kinetic energy , no matter how small , is well defined .",
    "the granular temperature defined above as a `` velocity '' along phase space trajectories is thus naturally proportional to kinetic energy : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass , @xmath43 the velocity , @xmath44 the moment of inertia , @xmath45 the angular velocity , and brackets denote an average over grains .",
    "since the granular and kinetic temperatures are defined up to a constant factor , we will equate them .",
    "this means that at any time , the kinetic energy provides an estimate of the frequency of elementary events in a multicontact system .",
    "consider a uniform granular material in simple shear flow .",
    "if we imagine simultaneously changing the force and time scales then the invariance in newton s equations guarantees that the dynamics will remain unaltered , resulting only in new velocities that are determined from the time rescaling . however , under the rescaling , quantities such as the pressure and strain rate will take different values .",
    "the quantities of interest are those that are invariant to the transformation .",
    "these quantities must be formed of ratios of force scales , ratios of time scales , or ratios of force to time scales .",
    "denote @xmath46 as the pressure , @xmath26 the shear stress , @xmath1 the strain rate , @xmath2 the mass density , and @xmath4 the average diameter of grains . some important invariant ( and dimensionless )",
    "quantities are : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52",
    ". these must be single valued functions of _ density _ only ( independent of the strain rate ) .",
    "this observation , established by the invariance in newton s equations which holds for granular flows in the dense and collisional regimes , automatically predicts bagnold s scaling : since @xmath53 is a function of density only , it follows that @xmath54 .",
    "this leads to a simple yet remarkable property : _ at a given density _ , changing the strain rate does not lead the system toward any different regime or `` phase '' . the material does not go closer to jamming because the strain rate is scaled down .",
    "the system is always exploring the same trajectories in phase space , but at a slower speed . in short",
    ", there is no quasi - static limit for perfectly hard grains .",
    "this is apparent in the jamming phase diagram of granular materials  @xcite where changing the density allows the granular material to jam , while changing the strain rate does not .",
    "this property is also directly related to the observation by campbell that `` there is no path between inertial ( rapid ) flow and quasi - static flow by varying the shear rate at fixed concentration ''  @xcite .",
    "this is no surprise once we understand the invariance of newton s equations for perfectly hard grains : only two regimes are accessible , jammed or inertial , and density is the only parameter which controls the statistical properties of a flow of perfectly hard grains .",
    "in constructing a numerical test our goals are to measure stress - strain relations when granular temperature and stresses are appropriately scaled , show that they compare well with the standard response of yield stress liquids , and show that the local rheology measured in simple shear flow matches the bulk rheology of a granular flow down an incline .    in order to address these issues ,",
    "we implement numerical simulations of granular materials in two different geometries :    * we implement simple shear flow in a cell with lees - edwards ( le ) boundary conditions . in this configuration ,",
    "the density and the shear rate is prescribed and the simulation cell is , by construction , translationally invariant .",
    "this grants direct access to averaged quantities of the granular temperature and stress tensor . using this configuration",
    "we can characterize the steady state relation between stresses , granular temperature and strain - rate and extract numerically the parameters of a constitutive law for granular materials .",
    "a screenshot of this shearing geometry is shown in figure  [ lepic ] .",
    "* we implement granular flow down an inclined plane made of stationary grains .",
    "the simulation cell is periodic in the direction ( @xmath55 ) parallel to the plane and the flow is inhomogeneous in the perpendicular ( @xmath56 ) direction . in this configuration ,",
    "the stresses are prescribed by the angle of the incline .",
    "we perform @xmath55-averaged , @xmath56-dependent measurements of granular temperature , velocity profiles and strain - rate .",
    "large heights of the granular layer grant access to the bulk rheology of the flow .",
    "this permits us to check the existence of a well - define bulk rheology in the large height limit , and to compare it with the measurements in simple shear .",
    "a picture of this shearing geometry is shown in figure  [ toruspic ] .    in order to make a quantitative comparison of the two simulations , we use the same material : a two - dimensional polydisperse mixture of constant density grains with the radii drawn from a flat distribution with average radius @xmath40 and width @xmath26 .",
    "for all of the simulations in this paper we set @xmath57 , using @xmath58 .",
    "this distribution prevents crystallization and produces an amorphous granular material , as can be seen from measurement of the pair correlation function in figure  [ paircorr ] .",
    "the horizontal axis ( @xmath12 ) in this figure corresponds to the distance between a pair of grains , divided by the sum of their radii .",
    "this normalizes the figure so that @xmath59 corresponds to contacting grains .",
    "other than this peak , the function has some small variation ( which implies a correlation ) between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "however , there is no correlation beyond @xmath60 .",
    "because there is no large scale correlation , this implies that the granular material is amorphous .",
    "in this paper we present data for normal and tangential coefficients of restitution given by @xmath61 .",
    "it was shown by chevoir et al  @xcite that the regimes reached by granular materials are almost independent of the restitution coefficients below some threshold around @xmath62 .",
    "different friction coefficient have been used : frictionless grains and @xmath63 .",
    "our simulations of granular materials rely on the contact dynamics algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we refer to the literature for technical details and present below a brief overview of the method , supplemented by a single addition we made in order to construct a lees - edwards simulation cell for frictional granular materials .",
    "a contact dynamics algorithm was constructed to carry out numerical simulation of spheres interacting through the enforcement of hard sphere conditions  @xcite .",
    "when a contact occurs there is an non - continuous force created that prevents the contacting grains from penetrating .",
    "the magnitude of this force is chosen to ensure that the final relative velocity @xmath64 of the grains is related to the initial relative velocity @xmath65 via the equations @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 are constant restitution coefficients that will depend on the shape and consistency of the grains , and the @xmath69 , @xmath70 subscripts represent the normal and tangential parts of the relative velocity with respect to the contact . at each time step",
    ", the algorithm computes the contact forces by first ensuring that these relations hold at each contact . to include friction , the contact dynamics algorithm ensures that the resulting tangential force @xmath71 is less than or equal to @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the friction coefficient between grains and @xmath74 is the normal force .",
    "if this constraint does not hold , then the algorithm sets @xmath75 in order to comply with coulomb friction .    in this way",
    "the contact dynamics algorithm calculates , at each time step , contact forces that are consistent with newton s equations and the hard sphere contact law .",
    "lees - edwards ( le ) boundary conditions permit us to prescribe the deformation of a material by controlling the positions of the image cells  @xcite . in all of the simulations presented here , we impose a constant strain rate @xmath76 so that a grain at position @xmath56 has an average velocity of @xmath77 in the @xmath55-direction ( see figure  [ lepic ] ) .",
    "it was recognized in early implementations of le boundary conditions that when deformation is applied through the image cells , the information needs time to propagate from the cell boundaries to its center . in order to ensure rapid propagation of this information and prevent the boundaries between cells from making unphysical contributions to the motion",
    ", it is necessary to modify newton s equations by introducing so - called sllod terms .",
    "these terms can be understood as a sort of `` shear bath '' , with all particles in the cell being directly coupled to the overall deformation  @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the sllod terms introduce a mechanical perturbation to the equations of motion that gives each grain an average velocity consistent with simple shear flow .",
    "if we separate the momentum @xmath15 of each grain @xmath21 into the average part @xmath78 and fluctuating part @xmath79 , so that @xmath80 , then the sllod equations read : @xmath81 the equation for the position @xmath13 is simply the result of writing the momentum in terms of an average and fluctuating part .",
    "the equation for @xmath79 contains a new term @xmath82 which forces the shear flow . since every grain in the primitive cell",
    "is acted upon by this mechanical force , the constant strain rate is imposed on all of the grains simultaneously at the beginning of the simulation .",
    "furthermore it can be proven that , in the le geometry , the sllod equations give an exact representation of simple shear flow arbitrarily far from equilibrium  @xcite .    for a granular material with non - zero friction coefficient @xmath73",
    ", the equations of motions should incorporate rotations of the grains ( for @xmath83 the tangential contact force is always zero and there is no rotation ) .",
    "it is expected that a sllod term should arise in the equations of motion for the angular velocity since , in the linear velocity profile indicative of simple shear flow , the top and bottom of every grain should be moving with slightly different velocities .",
    "this will give each grain an average rotation of @xmath84 which must be incorporated in equation  ( [ rotnewtonseqns ] ) just as the average velocity @xmath85 was incorporated in equation  ( [ sllodpos ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following equations : @xmath86 where @xmath87 denotes the fluctuating part of the angular velocity and we have inserted the moment of inertia of constant density disks in two dimensions .",
    "equations  ( [ sllodpos ] ) and ( [ sllodrot ] ) now give an exact representation of simple shear flow for a frictional granular material arbitrarily far from equilibrium .",
    "the primary interest of this procedure is that it permits us to simulate a sheared granular material with a homogeneous shear rate .",
    "experimental procedures , _",
    "e.g. _ in a couette cell , do not guarantee that the strain rate is homogeneous : the existence of walls induce a non - uniformity of the flow and possibly localization of the deformation .",
    "our protocol grants direct access to the rheology of the granular material in a self - averaging situation .",
    "we define the stress tensor @xmath88 via cauchy s equation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the average velocity in the @xmath91 direction ( averaged over all grains ) , @xmath2 is the mass density , and @xmath92 is the external force per volume .",
    "this equation simply states that the total time derivative of the average velocity ( left hand side ) is proportional to the divergence of the stress tensor , plus any external forces .",
    "cauchy s equation gives a definition of the stress tensor from which there exists a procedure to derive the functional form of the stress tensor .",
    "this is called the irving - kirkwood derivation  @xcite and it yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the fluctuating velocity of grain @xmath21 determined by @xmath95 , and v is the volume of the granular material ( or area in two dimensions ) .",
    "this symmetric stress tensor can be written in terms of three variables : the pressure @xmath46 , shear stress @xmath26 , and first normal stress difference @xmath96 defined as @xmath97 where the signs are chosen so that shear stress and pressure are positive in our conventions .",
    "the granular temperature @xmath38 is measured as @xmath98 which is proportional to the kinetic temperature from equation  ( [ kinetictemperature ] ) , with the factor of @xmath99 coming from the moment of inertia calculated for constant density discs .",
    "lastly , for all of the numerical data that will be presented , we quantify the density of the system by its packing fraction @xmath100 .",
    "the packing fraction is defined as the area occupied by grains divided by the total area of the system . in our simulations , packing fraction is proportional to both the mass density @xmath2 ( @xmath101 ) and the number density @xmath69 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "we first study the average relation between pressure @xmath46 , shear stress @xmath26 , shear rate @xmath76 , and granular temperature @xmath38 in simple shear , using the periodic and translationally invariant le cell .",
    "next we compare these results with data obtained for the granular flow down an inclined plane .        in all of the simple shear simulations presented here we have simulated @xmath103 grains in a square primitive cell ,",
    "although we have conducted a limited number of simulations with up to @xmath104 grains to ensure the accuracy of our observations . because the contact dynamics algorithm induces some amount of numerical noise , the motion of a collection of grains driven at different shear rates",
    "is not expected to reproduce exactly the same phase space trajectory . in figure  [ scaledledata ]",
    "we show raw data of the normalized pressure @xmath105 as function of shear strain ( strain rate multiplied by time ) , at a packing fraction of @xmath106 with no friction and at two different values of the shear rate .    according to the invariance in newton s equations",
    "@xmath105 should be independent of @xmath1 , and this behavior is confirmed by the measurements in figure  [ scaledledata ] . although the shear rates in the two plots differ by a factor of @xmath107 , the normalized pressure is virtually identical for both systems .",
    "interestingly , not only do the steady state values show no shear rate dependence , but the initial transient is virtually identical for both values of @xmath1 .",
    "the invariance in newton s equations also predicts that @xmath108 and @xmath109 are independent of @xmath1 . for all of the simulations we have carried out these predictions from the invariance",
    "are upheld although numerical noise often disrupts the perfect invariance for large values of shear strain , we see no change in the steady state values of normalized pressure , shear stress , or granular temperature as the shear rate is varied at constant density .",
    "these tests ensure that the simulations we conduct respect the invariance in newton s equations for hard spheres .    for a granular material characterized by its pressure @xmath46 , shear stress @xmath26 , temperature @xmath38 , and strain rate @xmath1",
    ", we can construct three independent invariant quantities : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 . in figure  [ soverpandeoversqrttvsshear ]",
    "we show values of these three independent invariant quantities as a function of shear strain for a frictionless granular material at packing fraction of @xmath106 . for all quantities",
    ", steady flow is reached by a shear of approximately @xmath113 , and we will subsequently provide stationary data by time - averaging our measurements between strains of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the values of @xmath110 and @xmath112 fluctuate much more than @xmath116 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath26 and @xmath46 depend on the forces between grains , which are highly fluctuating in the hard sphere limit . in our simulations with @xmath104 grains",
    "we observe that the fluctuations decrease while the average value remains constant .",
    "this suggests that in the limit of large system size , the fluctuations would disappear .      in figure  [ scaledlevspacking ]",
    "we present the steady state values of @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath110 in simple shear for a range of high packing fraction systems that we have studied , at zero friction .",
    "although there is relatively little change in these quantities for small packing fraction , for packing fractions larger that @xmath120 there is a large increase in the values of the stresses and granular temperature .",
    "additionally , the functional form of the stresses and granular temperature changes from approximately exponential to a function that grows faster than an exponential at @xmath121 .",
    "alam and luding  @xcite have measured the steady state values of the first normal stress difference @xmath96 , defined via equation  ( [ stressbasis ] ) , in simple shear flow using a monodisperse collection of grains . in dilute flows , a non - vanishing value for @xmath96 results from collisional terms and the anisotropy in the distribution of velocities at burnett order  @xcite .",
    "alam and luding reported that @xmath96 becomes negative at the onset of crystallization .",
    "we have thus measured the first normal stress difference in our system in order to ensure the absence of crystallization and as a signature of the breakdown of kinetic effects .",
    "the observation in figure  [ firstnormalstress ] that @xmath122 for all packing fractions in our system is consistent with the observation that our system remains amorphous .",
    "the decay of @xmath96 over all packing fractions is consistent with the idea that kinetic effects become less important as the packing fraction increases , especially after @xmath121 when @xmath96 begins to quickly decay .    in our numerical simulations",
    ", we expect the collisional contributions to the stress tensor to be negligible",
    ". a detailed study of the crossover between collisional and non - collisional regimes will be the topic of a future work  @xcite .",
    "for now we rely on the observation that the kinetic effects , as probed by the first normal stress difference , decay close to jamming .",
    "we also refer to prior works which support the same conclusion  @xcite .      in the simple shear cell",
    "the density and strain rate were specified , while stresses and granular temperature were measured .",
    "we now focus on flow down an inclined plane which provides a complementary situation . for incline flow , stresses are specified by the choice of an angle of inclination and by the gravitational field . then the profiles of velocity and velocity fluctuations are measured and grant access to profiles of strain rate and granular temperature .",
    "we report in figure  [ inclineprofs ] the packing fraction , granular temperature , and @xmath123 as a function of height for the steady flow of a non - frictional granular material at an angle of @xmath124 , with a total height of approximately @xmath125 grains .",
    "we have conducted simulations with heights ranging between @xmath126 and @xmath127 grain diameters to ensure that our results do not depend on the size of the system .",
    "we observe that , in the bulk central region of the flow , the packing fraction profile is uniform , the granular temperature is linear , and @xmath123 is constant .",
    "these observations hold in our simulations for all angles where the granular flow reaches a steady state .",
    "we only use data from these steady state flows in this paper .",
    "these observations are consistent with previous observations by silbert et al  @xcite .",
    "there are four quantities of interest for incline flows @xmath46 , @xmath26 , @xmath76 , and @xmath38 and these lead to three independent invariant quantities @xmath123 , @xmath110 , and @xmath112 .",
    "we observe in our simulations that all of these invariants are constant in the bulk of the incline flow .",
    "therefore it is legitimate to compare these constant values with the constant values obtained from simple shear simulations . in figure  [ matchincdensity ]",
    "we present how the constant values of @xmath110 , @xmath112 , and @xmath123 in the bulk of the flow depend on packing fraction and compare with our results from the simple shear cell .",
    "the fact that data from different shear flows fall on the same curves is remarkable and suggests that one theory should be able to describe simple shear and bulk incline granular flow .",
    "interestingly , the data from different flows do not overlap over a large interval of packing fraction : the flow down an inclined plane provides values at higher values of packing fraction than the simple shear cell .",
    "this is due to ( i ) steady flows down an incline plane are more easily reached for lower inclinations , hence higher densities ; and ( ii ) the simple shear deformation is more difficult to integrate numerically at higher densities , because the periodic cell induces additional constraints that the contact dynamics algorithm manages with difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , our use of two different configurations grants access to a broad range of @xmath123 , @xmath110 , and @xmath112 ; and the sets of data are consistent with the existence of a unique , local relation between them as apparent in figure  [ matchincdensity ] .      the excellent agreement between the two sets of data challenges the belief that non - local effects arise in dense granular flow .",
    "the data in figure  [ matchincdensity ] supports a very conservative opinion : the motion of the grains decorrelates beyond some finite length scale , in accord with the fast decay of the pair correlation function ( see figure  [ paircorr ] ) .    as a consequence , in the bulk of the flow down an incline , it is possible to view layers of granular materials as effective simple shear cells .",
    "such a layer of granular material at height @xmath56 responds essentially as if it was confined in a simple shear cell , in the absence of body forces , with sustained external stresses @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "of course the invariance in newton s equations , which holds exactly for the simple shear cell , is slightly broken by the gravitational force field .",
    "however , deep in the bulk of the flow , large confining stresses eventually dominate over the gravitational field .",
    "this approximate invariance suffices to predict that bagnold s scaling must hold for the bulk regions of incline flows and explains the numerical data of silbert and coworkers  @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamic equations are expected to arise when the gradients of macroscopic variables become small compared to the macroscopic variables themselves . what is surprising , however , is that the locality of the rheology is observable for the moderate heights that we can access in our numerical simulations .",
    "we believe that the reason why the hydrodynamic regime seems to be observed at accessible scales is the following : ( i ) the relevance of hydrodynamics limit depends on how a macroscopic quantity @xmath130 compares with @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is a length - scale ; ( ii ) @xmath132 is not the size of the grain or a cluster of grains it is the size of the region sampled by a given grain per strain unit , which is on the order of the mean - free path . since for a dense granular material @xmath133 , the validity of the hydrodynamic limit should hold over moderate heights .",
    "as we will see , our theory provides constitutive equations which relate the static friction coefficient @xmath110 to the ratio @xmath123 . anticipating the following sections , we present in figure  [ lemoney ] a plot of @xmath110 versus @xmath123 , with data from both the simple shear and incline flow geometries .",
    "as we will argue , such a plot is expected to be the granular counterpart of a stress versus strain rate plot for a glassy material  @xcite , with the shear stress normalized by the pressure and the strain rate normalized by the granular temperature .",
    "we see here that the analogy is striking : when rescaled properly the granular material presents typical features of normal yield stress fluids  @xcite . for large values of normalized strain rate ,",
    "the normalized stress is proportional to the normalized strain rate . for small values of the normalized strain rate ,",
    "the linear relationship no longer holds and there is a yield ( normalized ) stress at zero ( normalized ) strain rate .",
    "several interesting results stem from the preceding observations : ( i ) for a given density , only invariant quantities are relevant to describe the state of a granular flow ; ( ii ) when invariant quantities are considered , the granular material displays a `` normal '' rheology of a yield stress liquid ; and ( iii ) the rheology measured in the lees - edward cell extrapolates to the rheology measured from bulk data of incline flow .",
    "these observations foster our hope to construct local constitutive equations for dense granular materials . before addressing the specificities of the stz formulation of constitutive equations ,",
    "we wish to argue that the scaling invariance of newton s equations calls for a parallel scaling form of the constitutive equations",
    ".      in general , constitutive equations should provide a relation between stresses and strain - rate , and a set of state variables @xmath134 which characterize the internal structure of the granular material . for granular materials the granular temperature @xmath38 plays a quite specific role as a state variable .",
    "other state variables are expected to account only for geometric properties of the granular packing .",
    "ogawa  @xcite was the first to recognize that in granular materials the temperature can not be prescribed by a thermal bath , but is set by energy balance .",
    "kinetic theory provides estimates for the energy dissipation rate in dilute systems , hence providing approximations for the equation of motion which governs granular temperature . as a result",
    ", the notion of granular temperature has been tied to kinetic theory .",
    "granular temperature , however , is not reserved for the description of dilute flows .",
    "it is relevant in all inertial flows since , as discussed previously , there is no quasi - static limit for hard - spheres , even infinitely close to jamming . in particular",
    "the dense flows of our simulations do not verify the assumptions of kinetic theory , yet in these inertial regimes kinetic energy is a perfectly relevant physical observable and is set by energy balance .    at any time , the variation of kinetic energy results from the balance between external work done on the system and dissipative mechanisms .",
    "because the system explores phase - space trajectories at a velocity proportional to @xmath135 , the rate of energy dissipation should scale as @xmath136 .",
    "the square root gives the frequency of dissipative events and each event dissipates an energy proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "energy is introduced to the system via the external forcing with a rate of @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the energy balance equation should be of the form @xmath138 with @xmath2 being the mass density .",
    "the factor @xmath139 is a geometric factor which depends on the relative positions of grains , but should not incorporate any further dependence on @xmath38 or the stress tensor . in particular , it should depend on the mass density @xmath2 and possibly on other state variables @xmath134 which characterize the geometrical structure of the granular packing . by scaling invariance ,",
    "the steady state value of @xmath139 should depend of @xmath2 only .",
    "this equation has a similar form to the energy conservation equation derived in kinetic theory @xcite .",
    "this is no surprise since kinetic theory must uphold the invariance of newton s equations .",
    "kinetic theory provides an estimate for @xmath140 and it is possible that even in dense flows this estimate remains reasonable for non - frictional grains .",
    "however , multibody collisions may induce departure of this relation from the predictions of kinetic theory .",
    "in figure  [ alphavsshear ] we present a plot of @xmath139 as a function of shear strain for a non - frictional granular material in simple shear flow , calculated via equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) .",
    "we observe a dynamic in @xmath139 at the start of the simulation which quickly disappears .",
    "the dynamic is likely due to the effects of an unknown state variable @xmath141 .",
    "since granular temperature is defined as the frequency of elementary events along phase - space trajectories , the strain rate should scale as @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes an unknown function and , once again , the state variables @xmath134 are purely geometric .",
    "if we combine equation  ( [ fconst ] ) with equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) in steady state where @xmath144 , then we see that @xmath145 \\dot{\\gamma}^2     \\label{bagnoldcouette}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is equal to the function @xmath143 , with @xmath112 evaluated using equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) .",
    "this equation implies that if constitutive relations are written in the form of equations  ( [ tempeqn ] )  and  ( [ fconst ] ) , then bagnold s scaling is upheld .",
    "in the rest of this section we study the stz formulation of constitutive equations and apply it to dense granular materials .",
    "we will see that the stz theory , when applied to granular materials , makes a prediction for the function @xmath143 in equation  ( [ fconst ] ) .",
    "the shear transformation zone ( stz ) theory of amorphous solids was proposed in  @xcite to account for the behavior of dense amorphous materials at low temperature .",
    "the theory is motivated by observations from simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite which suggest that plastic deformation in amorphous materials results from non - affine rearrangements of small clusters of particles  @xcite .",
    "additionally , falk and langer were able to show that there exist different types of zones which present a preferential response to different orientations of shear forces .",
    "they introduced the densities of these zones as state variables to characterize the internal structure of the molecular packing .",
    "central to the theory is the assumption that once an stz undergoes an elementary rearrangement in a given direction it is unlikely that it can shear again in the same direction , although it can easily shear in the reverse direction .",
    "thus zones appear as two state systems , the states corresponding to the zone orientation being aligned ( denoted @xmath147 ) or anti - aligned ( denoted @xmath148 ) with the shear stress . a rearrangement corresponds to a transition of a zone from a @xmath149-state into a @xmath150-state and vice - versa .",
    "the plastic shear rate is given by the rate at which stzs respond to external stresses : @xmath151 where @xmath152 are the stress - dependent probabilities that zones of @xmath149 types are transformed into one another .",
    "this constitutive relation must be complemented with an equation of motion for the densities @xmath153 , which is postulated to be of the form : @xmath154 the first two terms correspond to the transformation of stzs into their two possible states .",
    "the last term accounts for the fact that stzs are renewed by the overall macroscopic deformation : it contains a creation and destruction rate , both proportional to the plastic work @xmath155 of external forces per time unit .      before applying stz theory to granular materials",
    ", we check that the same qualitative observations as in  @xcite can be performed in these systems .",
    "namely that non - affine motion occurs in localized regions and that the positions of the localized regions depends sensitively on the orientation of the shear .",
    "the first observation motivates the choice of density of stzs as a state variable , and the second observation shows that each stz has an orientation and therefore only responds to a certain orientation of shear stress .",
    "these observations are based on a measure of the non - affinity of the deformation of a cluster of a few molecules or grains . following  @xcite ,",
    "the grains undergoing non - affine rearrangement can be determined by calculating , for each grain , the local strain rate at time @xmath156 .",
    "then , by measuring the difference @xmath4 between the actual position at a later time @xmath70 and the position predicted from the local strain rate at time @xmath156 , we can determine which grains have moved non - affinely in the time period @xmath157 . in practice , @xmath4 is determined by minimizing    @xmath158 \\big ) ^2     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with respect to the shear rate @xmath159 , where the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 are spatial coordinates and the index @xmath69 runs over all grains within two diameters of the reference grain , labeled by the index @xmath160 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath161 , denoted @xmath4 , is an approximation of the local deviation from affine displacement for the reference grain in the time interval @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "if there is no non - affine motion , then the motion of each individual grain should be completely determined by a local shear rate and @xmath163 . if there is non - affine motion then @xmath164 .",
    "we have applied this test for non - affine motion to granular materials in simple shear to produce figure  [ stzfs ] .",
    "this figure is the counterpart of figure  3 in  @xcite and figure  7 in  @xcite , which were created from simulations of an amorphous lennard - jones solid .",
    "each picture has been created by shearing an identical initial arrangement of particles in a certain direction .",
    "@xmath4 is the local measure of non - affinity obtained by comparison between the initial and final states .",
    "if @xmath4 is larger than a reference value , the particle is said to have moved non - affinely and colored black .",
    "in figure  [ stzfs ] part ( a ) the system is sheared from strains of @xmath165 to @xmath166 , and in ( b ) the system is sheared to from strains of @xmath167 to @xmath168 .",
    "we notice that there is a tendency for the regions of non - affine displacement to form clusters , and the size of the resulting non - affine regions is about the same in both ( a ) and ( b ) . in ( c )",
    "the system is sheared from strains of @xmath165 to @xmath168 and now the size of the non - affine regions increases , suggesting many more fundamental rearrangements of stzs in the larger time period . in",
    "( d ) the system is sheared from strains of @xmath165 to @xmath169 ( in the _ opposite _ direction ) , starting from the same initial configuration as in ( a ) .",
    "once again we observe that the non - affine regions tend to form clusters .",
    "however , in comparing ( a ) and ( d ) , we notice that the size of the non - affine regions is about the same in the two figures , but the locations are different .",
    "if the regions undergoing non - affine displacement did not have an orientation we would expect non - affine motion to occur in the same location , regardless of the orientation of the stress .",
    "however this is not the case and the data in figure  [ stzfs ] suggests that the regions that move non - affinely have an orientation .",
    "this is qualitative evidence that the core assumptions of stz theory are upheld in granular materials .",
    "the stz densities @xmath153 account for structural properties of a molecular or granular packing .",
    "they are thus expected to depend on the positions of grains , orientations and distribution of forces , orientations of velocities , but not on the overall amplitude of the forces or amplitude of velocities . following  @xcite ,",
    "these functions are determined using the invariance in newton s equations .",
    "since @xmath155 represents the plastic work done on the system per unit time it should be proportional to @xmath170 . in order to make @xmath155 invariant ,",
    "we normalize by pressure so that @xmath171 . as for @xmath152 , because of the invariance in newton s equations we can separate the rate at which an stz attempts to rearrange from the probability that an attempt leads to a successful rearrangement . the attempt rate must be proportional to @xmath135 which sets the microscopic event rate and the probability to rearrange is written as an exponential activation factor of the invariant form @xmath172 .",
    "this yields @xmath173 .    combining the expressions for @xmath152 and @xmath155 with equations  ( [ firststz ] ) and ( [ secondstz ] ) ,",
    "while making a change of variables from @xmath174 to @xmath175 and @xmath176 , yields the following stz equations for granular materials : @xmath177 @xmath178 denotes the total density of zones and @xmath179 measures the mismatch between zones of different orientations and therefore is related to the anisotropy of the granular packing . @xmath180 and @xmath181 are constants that do not depend on the macroscopic variables @xmath76 , @xmath38 , @xmath26 , or @xmath46 .",
    "however we would expect these constants to depend on properties of the grains such as shape , distributions of radii , restitution coefficients , friction coefficients , or other local static variables , including density .",
    "these equations present two types of steady state solutions  @xcite .",
    "one branch of solutions represents a jammed state @xmath182 , and occurs when @xmath183 .",
    "the other branch of solution represents the steady flow and occurs when @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "an elementary analysis of the phase diagram of this dynamical system indicates that the jammed state is stable if and only if @xmath186 and the flowing state is stable otherwise .",
    "the limit of stability occurs at a critical angle @xmath187 , which is the solution of @xmath188 @xmath187 is identified as the repose angle of our granular material .    in the steady flowing regime",
    "@xmath189 , stz theory yields the following relation : @xmath190 in particular , in the limit when the ratio @xmath191 vanishes , @xmath110 converges towards @xmath192",
    ". therefore the stz theory accommodates cases where there is a residual pressure and shear stress at zero shear rate , and predicts that in this case the shear stress will be proportional to the pressure .",
    "the constitutive equations for granular materials introduced in this paper are entirely specified by equations  ( [ tempeqn ] ) and  ( [ stzequations ] ) .",
    "we now compare the steady state relations predicted by these equations with our numerical data , which provides independent access to @xmath26 , @xmath46 , @xmath38 , and @xmath76 in different shearing geometries .",
    "we first test equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) in simple shear flow .",
    "we find that for all densities investigated , much like figure  [ alphavsshear ] , @xmath139 is constant as a function of shear strain . additionally we find that the steady state value only depends on the density and friction coefficient .",
    "we present the measured steady state values of @xmath139 in figure  [ alphavspacking ] as a function of packing fraction , for frictionless ( @xmath83 ) and frictional ( @xmath63 ) granular materials . for frictionless granular materials @xmath139",
    "appears to vary exponentially as a function of packing fraction , whereas for frictional granular materials @xmath139 does not take on an obvious functional form .",
    "next , we test the steady state stz prediction from equation  ( [ stzconstitutive ] ) . in figure",
    "[ money ] we have plotted numerical data of @xmath110 as a function of @xmath116 for frictional and non - frictional granular materials in both simple shear flow and incline flow . the line drawn through the data is a fit to equation  ( [ stzconstitutive ] ) .",
    "the fit matches the data from both flowing geometries very well .    to construct the fit , we have used the data from _ the simple shear cell only_. this fit permits us to extrapolate the rheology for the flow down an incline plane , even at the approach of the repose angle",
    "this shows that an accurate determination of the coefficients from the stz equation  ( [ stzconstitutive ] ) in one shearing geometry allows for prediction in a different shearing geometry .",
    "we have implemented numerical simulations of dense granular flows in order to clarify the microscopic origin of jamming and the specific assumptions needed to construct the stz formulation of constitutive equations for dense granular flows .",
    "our first goal was to obtain detailed information on dense granular flows , in particular on the locality of the constitutive relation .",
    "for this purpose we implemented two different simulation configurations : a simple shear cell with lees - edwards periodic boundary conditions and sllod equations of motion , and the flow of a granular material down a rough incline . in both configurations we measured the components of the stress tensor , packing fraction , strain rate , and granular temperature .",
    "we have also observed the normal stress difference and shown that it vanishes in dense flows so that , in this regime , shear stress and pressure completely characterize the stress tensor . in each configuration we studied ,",
    "the rheology of dense granular materials is entirely specified by five quantities : shear stress @xmath26 , pressure @xmath46 , packing fraction @xmath100 , strain rate @xmath1 and granular temperature @xmath38 . in the shear cell @xmath100 and @xmath1 are prescribed , and in the flow down an incline @xmath26 and @xmath46 are prescribed .",
    "the rheology of the granular material requires us to specify three relations which determine the remaining unknowns .",
    "there are many equivalent ways these relations can be formulated , but we wished to formulate them in a way that emphasized the invariance of newton s equations and the expected scaling form of constitutive equations .",
    "we found , as anticipated in  @xcite , that the relation between quantities @xmath116 and @xmath110 is remarkably similar to the stress - strain rate relation in a normal elasto - plastic transition .",
    "we were surprised to observe the quality of the fit to the data of figure  [ money ] with expression  ( [ stzconstitutive ] ) without any density dependence of the parameters of the theory .",
    "we would have expected that these parameters might involve strong density dependence .",
    "this observation strengthens the hypothesis that the distinguishing feature of granular materials is the way energy balance is prescribed and otherwise , once the variables are appropriately rescaled , they behave like `` normal '' materials .",
    "another relation emerges naturally from the expectation that energy balance in granular materials should take the form in equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) .",
    "the density - dependent parameter @xmath139 accounts for the rate of dissipation of energy and we would expect it to be reasonably captured by collisional integrals of the type used in kinetic theory ( at least for non - frictional materials ) .",
    "a proper derivation of energy dissipation in dense flows now appears as an accessible yet challenging issue that we wish to examine in future works .",
    "finally , a third relation remains to be specified .",
    "this relation can be , for example , a prescription for @xmath110 or @xmath116 as a function of packing fraction .",
    "we observed this relation in figure  [ matchincdensity ] , but did not attempt to model it .",
    "this missing relation should arise from some understanding of how the rheology depends on the local density .",
    "such a property might arise from studies of free - volume formulations of the rheology of dense granular materials .",
    "@xcite we did not wish to elaborate this aspect in order to focus on the stress - strain rate relation , which is the most immediate prediction of stz theory .",
    "as we see , the stz theory correctly predicts one among three relations which are necessary for a complete description of dense granular flows .",
    "this relation , coupled to bagnold s scaling , suffices to account for the shape of the velocity profile down an incline .",
    "however it does not account for the overall amplitude of the velocity profile or the uniform value of the density as a function of @xmath193 .",
    "note that we have compared here data from a lees - edward cell with the rheology of a flow down an inclined plane in the limit where the height of the granular material is large .",
    "the agreement between the two sets of data indicates that there is no long - range structure which governs the flow .",
    "this does not mean , however , that no gradient or diffusive terms should ever appear in the final form of the rheology of granular flows .",
    "in particular , we expect that a diffusive term should arise in equation  ( [ tempeqn ] ) , but in the large height limit this diffusive term does not appear in the bulk rheology .",
    "this brings us to the observations by pouliquen  @xcite of a relation @xmath194 which governs jamming .",
    "these observations have led to the idea that non - local constitutive equations might be required to capture the rheology of granular materials .",
    "however , we expect these observations to be `` normal '' finite size effects . for example",
    ", it was observed in  @xcite that an exponentially decaying kernel in place of @xmath155 in equation  ( [ secondstz ] ) was sufficient to account for large values of @xmath194 when @xmath195 .",
    "the analytical form of the kernel used in this work was consistent with an exponential decay of correlation in the system , again consistent with the notion that short - range correlations suffice to understand these effects .",
    "but other theories also successfully introduce finite length scales to account for macroscopic phenomena .",
    "for example , bazant s spot model  @xcite relates such a length scale to the size of diffusive regions of high free - volume .",
    "such concepts are very interesting as they provide routes to understanding non - trivial phenomena in granular physics , relying on very plausible forms of finite size corrections to hydrodynamics .",
    "another puzzling observation by pouliquen was that the amplitude of the velocity profile seemed to scale as @xmath196 .",
    "as we saw previously , this amplitude is governed by @xmath197 and a missing relation between _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath110 and @xmath100 .",
    "we thus can not provide an interpretation for these observations .",
    "our observations on a model system strongly suggest that the definition of a local rheology for granular materials is , in principle , possible .",
    "moreover , we see emerging from our analysis some state variables and their equations of motion . this now opens a very exciting route toward a set of local hydrodynamic equations for dense granular materials : such equations will offer a predictive tool to further address fundamental and practical questions in numerous situations where flow equations for granular materials are much needed .",
