    "this fact is amazing because the madelung energy and the c.m .",
    "energy are both very different ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "this difference is compensated almost completely by the relative energy of the paired phase .",
    "fig.4 shows the phase diagram for the single electron versus the paired wc phase in the @xmath1 @xmath78 plane . in shaded regions ,",
    "the electron pairs are in singlet state and in triplet states elsewhere .",
    "the spin configuration of the paired phase has been determined irrespective of the question , if the single electron phase is below both paired ( singlet or triplet ) phases .",
    "the thin full lines separate regions with different relative ( internal ) angular momentum @xmath105 of the pairs , which has the lowest energy .",
    "the value of @xmath105 is indicated in each region as well .",
    "( even @xmath105 belongs to the state and odd @xmath105 to the triplet state . )",
    "the thick full line separates the regions where the single electron wc is the ground state from regions , where the paired wc has the lower energy .",
    "we want to emphasize that this figure does not say anything about the issue if any other ( e.g. liquid ) phase is lower in energy than the phases considered here .",
    "the kinks in the phase boundary are connected with changes of the total spin of the paired phase .",
    "first , we discuss the case @xmath73 . for @xmath1 above 19",
    ", the energetically lower state is the single electron wc and below it is the paired phase . clearly , in the limit of high densities ( small @xmath1 ) any liquid state should win .",
    "it is physically imaginable , that in increasing the density , the state starts with the single electron wc , then adopts the paired state before it goes over to the liquid .",
    "if there are states with 3 , 4 , ... electrons involved , will be the focus of further investigations .",
    "+ for a certain finite @xmath78 , the density , where the transition to the paired ground state occurs , becomes higher .",
    "in other words , for higher @xmath78 one needs less dilute electron systems to produce a single electron wc .",
    "this is physically obvious , because the magnetic field helps to localize the electrons . in other words , lowering the density cases pair breaking .",
    "now we discuss the pair breaking process as a function of @xmath78 for fixed @xmath1 , say @xmath106 .",
    "if we start with @xmath73 and increase @xmath78 , the paired state undergoes first some spin transitions from singlet to triplet and vice versa before the pairs break in the triplet state .",
    "it should be mentioned that pair breaking and spin transition are not coupled together .",
    "the reason is that the zeeman energy is too small to play a decisive role .",
    "fig.5 shows the the phase diagram again , but the magnetic field axis is replaced by the filling factor @xmath107 \\ ; r_s^2[a.u.^*])$ ] ( using the parameters of gaas ) .",
    "this plot has the advantage of showing the physically important parameter @xmath0 directly , but does not allow the discussion of the limit @xmath73 , because it is transformed to @xmath108 . ) again , thin lines separate regions with different @xmath105 ( and therefore total spin ) of the paired phase and the thick line separates the single electron wc ground state from the paired wc . as to be expected , the single electron wc is restricted to the low density small filling factor region . it is clear that in a complete phase diagram , the region , which is here attributed to the paired phase , can be further restricted by the inclusion of all kinds of liquid phases ( and possibly wc phases with n=2,3 , ... electrons per cell ) .",
    "because the laughlin liquid is restricted to discrete filling factors , we compare in fig.6 the energy ( or , more conveniently , @xmath109 ) of different phases for fixed @xmath110 as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the zeeman energy is omitted in this figure because the paired phase is triplet over the whole @xmath1 range .",
    "therefore it would have contributed for a given @xmath1 the same amount to all phases , but introduce an unpleasant pole at @xmath111 into the curves .",
    "( in all calculations , however , the zeeman energy has to be taken into account because of the different spin configurations in the paired wc . )",
    "the curve for the laughlin liquid from ref .",
    "includes landau level mixing ( as our results do ) by adding a variational correlation factor to the laughlin function .",
    "( the value at @xmath111 corresponds to the result of the original laughlin function . ) as seen in fig.6 , the laughlin liquid and the single electron wc are the ground state for @xmath1 below and above 15 , respectively .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with experiment . in our result for @xmath112 ( not shown ) ,",
    "the single electron wc is the ground state over the whole range of densities .",
    "this is not quite correct , because experiments suggest that the domain of the wc begins at @xmath113 .",
    "inclusion of a variational correlation factor to the wc wave - function fixes the phase boundary between the laughlin liquid and the wc @xcite .",
    "this amendment could not be added here , because it would have become too complicated for the paired wc and in comparing both wc phases we needed a description on the same footing .",
    "we have shown that the paired wc is energetically more favorable than the single electron wc for higher densities and lower magnetic fields .",
    "if we start with the paired wc , lowering the density and increasing the magnetic field will break the pairs .",
    "at least in gaas , the zeeman energy plays a less important role than the angular momentum dependence of the internal ( relative coordinate ) energy .",
    "observe that changing the internal angular momentum ( from even to odd ) is coupled with a change of the total spin of each cluster due to the pauli principle .",
    "therefore , the paired phase undergoes first some singlet triplet transitions before the pairs break and the single electron wc is reached .",
    "the singlet triplet transitions have the same physical origin as the corresponding transitions in quantum dots , because they are driven by the internal energy , which is similar in either system . + in our approach , the interaction within each cluster is exactly accounted for ( including exchange and correlations ) . in both cases ,",
    "inter_cell interaction is considered in second order van der waals approximation ( no exchange , coulomb interaction in dipole approximation ) .",
    "the validity of the second order approximation has been checked in ref . by estimating the third order contribution , which amounts to a few % .",
    "we did not include higher order contributions from two reasons .",
    "first , they spoil the exact decoupling and make the paired wc intractable .",
    "second , these corrections have most likely the same sign in the single electron and the paired phase and they cancel partly in comparison of both energies .",
    "the neglect of inter - cell exchange ( but keeping the coulomb correlations ) is justified in the low density and high magnetic field limit , because the exchange energy drops off exponentially , but the correlation energy like @xmath114 .",
    "it seems to be worthwhile to elaborate on the differences of this work and ref .. they targeted on high lls ( low magnetic fields ) , and high electron densities ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "ll mixing and incomplete spin polarization are ruled out and the completely filled lls are frozen out and influence the upper ll only through a screening in the e e interaction .",
    "therefore we called both treatments in the abstract complementary. what seems to be interesting is that despite approaching reality with different assumptions and virtually from opposite sides , the effect of clusterization of the liquids is found in both treatments .",
