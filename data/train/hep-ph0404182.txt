    "<S> in the effective field theory of quantum gravitation coupled to @xmath0 scalars , @xmath1 fermions , and @xmath2 vectors , tree unitarity is violated at an energy squared of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is newton s constant . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to radiative corrections proportional to @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the typical energy ) , due to loops of such particles . </S>",
    "<S> new physics must enter before @xmath8 gev in the standard model , and @xmath9 gev in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .    to    shortly after discovering the fundamental constant of quantum mechanics that now bears his name </S>",
    "<S> , planck noticed that it may be combined with the fundamental constants of relativity and gravitation to make a constant with the units of mass . </S>",
    "<S> this mass also bears his name , @xmath10 gev / c@xmath11 . while he could not know the physical significance of this extremely large mass , he did remark that it could be considered as the fundamental unit of mass .    </S>",
    "<S> a century later , we still do not know the true physical significance of the planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we regard the planck mass in the context of an effective quantum field theory of gravitation @xcite . at leading order , this theory is simply einstein s theory of general relativity . beyond leading order , there are corrections to the predictions of einstein s theory proportional to powers of @xmath12 , where @xmath7 is the typical energy of the process under consideration ( here and henceforth we work with units where @xmath13 , for convenience ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus the expansion parameter of this effective theory is proportional to @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion , and hence the usefulness of the effective theory , breaks down at energies of order the planck mass .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we endeavor to make this statement more precise . </S>",
    "<S> we use tree unitarity to determine the energy at which the effective theory of quantum gravity breaks down . while dimensional analysis dictates that the theory breaks down at energies of order @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , it does not reveal the presence of dimensionless constants . </S>",
    "<S> does the expansion break down at an energy close to the planck mass , @xmath16 gev , the reduced planck mass , @xmath17 gev ( which appears naturally in einstein s theory @xcite ) , or perhaps some altogether different energy ?    </S>",
    "<S> when the effective theory breaks down , a new description of the physics becomes appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> this new description may become relevant before the energy at which the effective theory breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> thus the energy at which the effective theory breaks down places an upper bound on the energy at which new physics must enter . </S>",
    "<S> unitarity has been used to determine the energy at which other effective field theories break down , such as the fermi theory of the weak interaction @xcite , the spontaneously - broken electroweak theory ( with no higgs boson ) @xcite , and the standard model in higher dimensions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the partial - wave amplitude for a @xmath18 elastic scattering amplitude satisfies the unitarity condition @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> if the leading - order contribution to the amplitude violates this condition , then the expansion can not converge and the effective theory is useless . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is thus to calculate all @xmath18 scattering amplitudes in quantum gravity and to ask at what energy they violate unitarity .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard model contains scalar , fermion , and vector fields , with couplings to gravity that depend only on the particles masses and momenta . at energies of order the planck mass , the particles masses are negligible . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the scattering amplitudes in the symmetric phase of the electroweak theory , where all particle masses vanish .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin with the scattering of scalar particles , @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> there are two such ( complex ) scalar particles in the standard model , corresponding to the two components of the higgs doublet field . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the case @xmath22 , in which there is only an @xmath23-channel diagram , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree ] . </S>",
    "<S> there are two reasons for doing so . </S>",
    "<S> first , amplitudes which include a @xmath24- or @xmath25-channel diagram do not yield a well - defined partial - wave amplitude , since the integration over the scattering angle diverges at @xmath26 or @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to an infrared singularity due to the exchange of an on - shell graviton , and is an irrelevant complication which we choose to avoid . </S>",
    "<S> second , the fraction of processes in which @xmath28 diminishes as the number of particles increases . </S>",
    "<S> there are many fields in the standard model , so neglecting this small subset of processes is a good approximation . </S>",
    "<S> it is for these same reasons that we neglect processes of the type @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> the scattering of scalar particles is actually the most subtle case , since their coupling to gravitons is not fixed uniquely by their mass and momenta at leading order . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of a scalar field to gravity is given at leading order by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath32 is the cosmological constant , @xmath33 is the ricci scalar , @xmath34 is the scalar mass , and @xmath35 is a free parameter . we do not know the value of @xmath35 in the standard model , so we leave it as a free parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it is only for a scalar field that such an ambiguity exists . </S>",
    "<S> the case @xmath36 , @xmath37 corresponds to the conformal limit of the theory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude for @xmath23-channel scalar - scalar scattering , at energies much greater than the scalar mass , is @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the total center - of - momentum energy and @xmath40 is the wigner @xmath41 function , where @xmath20 is the total angular momentum , @xmath42 is the difference of the helicities of the initial - state particles , and @xmath43 is the difference of the helicities of the final - state particles . </S>",
    "<S> the first term corresponds to @xmath44 exchange , while the second corresponds to @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath45 component of a virtual graviton couples to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor , which explains why the @xmath45 term vanishes in the conformal limit ( @xmath37 ) , where @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a @xmath45 component of a virtual graviton does not violate any physical principles . while a real graviton must contain only helicity @xmath47 components @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> a virtual graviton can contain a @xmath45 component . </S>",
    "<S> there is no violation of angular - momentum selection rules in quantum gravity , as recently claimed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this claimed was based on the assumption that a virtual graviton can not have a @xmath45 component .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     unitarity demands that the eigenvalues of the matrix of partial - wave amplitudes satisfy @xmath48 which implies that @xmath49 . the matrix in table  [ tab : partial ] has only one nonzero eigenvalue , @xmath50 corresponding to the ( unnormalized ) eigenvector @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> tree unitarity is therefore violated at an energy squared of @xmath52 in the standard model with one higgs doublet and three generations of fermions , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> thus tree unitarity is violated at an energy @xmath56 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is about one half of the planck mass .    if nature is supersymmetric , then there are many more particles to consider , since every standard - model particle has a superpartner . in the scattering amplitudes . </S>",

    "<S> ] in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with two higgs doublets , @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> unitarity is violated at an energy @xmath59 gev . </S>",
    "<S> this is about one third of the planck mass .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could consider the @xmath45 partial - wave amplitude , which only receives a contribution from scalars . </S>",
    "<S> one finds that tree unitarity is violated at an energy squared of @xmath60 we do not know the value of @xmath35 , so let us choose @xmath61 for illustrative purposes . with this choice , tree unitarity is violated in the standard model at @xmath62 , while in the minimal supersymmetric standard model it is violated at @xmath63 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to understand the origin of the factor @xmath64 that appears in the partial - wave amplitude , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> consider the @xmath23-channel elastic scattering of the state given by the eigenvector @xmath51 , represented by the tree diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ tree ] . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop correction to the amplitude due to particles other than gravitons is given by the diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ loop ] , where the loop contains scalars , fermions , and vector bosons . </S>",
    "<S> elastic unitarity , via eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : unitarity ] ) ( with the inequality saturated ) , tells us that the imaginary part of the @xmath44 partial wave of this one - loop diagram equals the square of the @xmath44 partial wave of the tree diagram . </S>",
    "<S> thus the factor @xmath65 is simply the weighted sum over all the particles that circulate in the loop .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath44 partial - wave amplitude to one - loop order is @xmath66 where the superscript in parentheses indicates the order in @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used @xmath67 in the above equation , as well as the fact that @xmath68 , given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : eigenvalue ] ) , is real . </S>",
    "<S> the unitarity condition @xmath69 implies @xmath70 at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> we see that this corresponds to the imaginary part of the one - loop correction being less than half of the tree - level amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> this is a reasonable criterion for the convergence of the perturbative expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the real part of the one - loop correction , @xmath71 , is ultraviolet divergent . </S>",
    "<S> this divergence is absorbed into the coefficients of the @xmath72 and @xmath73 terms in the lagrangian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the coefficients of these terms , relative to the coefficient of the @xmath33 term in the lagrangian of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) , are of order @xmath74 , rather than simply @xmath5 .    since @xmath65 is large , it is interesting to consider the large-@xmath65 limit of the scattering amplitude , defined as @xmath75 while keeping @xmath76 fixed . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the leading correction to the scattering amplitude at @xmath77 order arises from the @xmath78 iteration of the one - loop diagram , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ multi ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can sum the geometric series generated by these leading corrections , to obtain @xmath79 this expression for the @xmath44 partial wave satisfies elastic unitarity , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : unitarity ] ) ( with the inequality saturated ) , exactly , regardless of the size of @xmath68 . thus , at leading order in @xmath80 , unitarity is respected at arbitrary energies , despite the violation of tree unitarity at the energy given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bound ] ) .    the amplitude in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : largen ] ) holds on the positive , real @xmath23 axis above the branch cut . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the amplitude in the complex @xmath23 plane , in the large-@xmath65 limit , may be obtained from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : largen ] ) by analytic continuation : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an arbitrary renormalization scale . </S>",
    "<S> this amplitude is unitary , but a pair of complex - conjugate poles on the physical sheet violate the usual analyticity properties . </S>",
    "<S> these poles yield acausal effects which become appreciable at energies near @xmath83 @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> we showed that this is related to radiative corrections , proportional to @xmath6 , due to loops of such particles in the graviton propagator . </S>",
