    "deep surveys in the extragalactic universe give the most fundamental information to understand when and how galaxies formed and evolved , as well as the large - scale structure and geometry of our universe .",
    "the best image in the optical wavelengths has been obtained by the hubble space telescope ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ; williams et al . 2000 ; gardner et al .",
    "2000 ) , and it provides us with valuable information for the distant universe . on the other hand , deep surveys in the near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths such as the @xmath0 band are also very important because the uncertainties in the evolutionary effect of galaxies and extinction by dust are less significant for galaxies observed in the nir than in optical .",
    "one of the deepest images in the nir has been obtained recently by the 8.2 m subaru telescope : the subaru deep field ( sdf , maihara et al .",
    "the field of view is @xmath14 with the total integration time of 12 hours for the @xmath15 band and 10 hours for the @xmath16 bands , with the average seeing of about 0.4 arcsec .",
    "the 5-sigma limiting magnitude is @xmath0=23.5 ( in total magnitude ) , and 350 objects are detected down to this magnitude . in this paper",
    "we report a detailed comparison of the counts , colors , and size distributions of the faint galaxies observed in the sdf with a standard theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution , to obtain implications for overall galaxy evolution on the cosmological scale .",
    "a number of observational studies on the faint galaxy number counts in the @xmath0 band have been published ( e.g. , mobasher et al .",
    "1986 ; gardner et al . 1993 ; glazebrook et al . 1994",
    "; mcleod et al . 1995 ; djorgovski et al . 1995 ; gardner et al . 1996 ; moustakas et al . 1997",
    "; huang et al . 1997 ; bershady et al .",
    "1998 ; minezaki et al .",
    "1998 , szokoly , et al . 1998 ; saracco et al . 1999 ; visnen et al .",
    "2000 ) , and compilation of these counts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts - allobs ] .",
    "however the present status of the faint - end @xmath0 counts is rather controversial .",
    "indeed , the counts of bershady et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are larger by a factor of more than 3 than those of moustakas et al .",
    "( 1997 ) at @xmath17 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts - allobs ] .",
    "one of the possible origins of this discrepancy is the systematic uncertainty in deriving the observational galaxy counts .",
    "generally the detection of galaxies at the faintest magnitudes is not complete and the completeness depends heavily on the detection criterion , seeing , and galaxy size , surface brightness , and luminosity profile ( either exponential or de vaucouleurs law ) .",
    "the published faint nir counts are generally corrected for incompleteness of detection probability , but the procedure of the incompleteness correction is different from one author to another , and model - dependent .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is especially significant for high - redshift galaxies at the faintest magnitudes , because there is a well - known physical selection effect against high - redshift galaxies : the geometrical effect of the expanding universe makes the surface brightness of galaxies rapidly dimmer with increasing redshift as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the angular diameter distance and luminosity distance , respectively .",
    "in fact , totani & yoshii ( 2000 , hereafter ty00 ) has shown that this effect of the cosmological dimming is significant for the hdf galaxies .",
    "the scheme to estimate photometric magnitude , such as aperture , isophotal , or corrected total magnitudes , is also important .",
    "the isophotal magnitude measures only the photons within the detection isophote determined by the threshold surface brightness of galaxy detection , and this scheme tends to underestimate the flux of the faintest galaxies near the detection limit . on the other hand",
    ", aperture magnitude tends to underestimate the flux of brightest objects when a fixed aperture is adopted .",
    "the low counts of saracco et al .",
    "( 1999 ) at @xmath21 may be due to this effect .",
    "the total magnitude is generally model - dependent , and one must be careful in a comparison between the counts as a function of corrected total magnitude and general theoretical prediction .",
    "the above consideration suggests that there is an inconsistency in comparing theoretical models with published counts already corrected in a model - dependent way .",
    "therefore , the best way to derive implications on galaxy formation and cosmology is that observed raw data are compared _ consistently _ with realistic theoretical predictions which take into account the completeness and selection effects under the observational conditions ( yoshii 1993 ; yoshii & peterson 1995 ; ty00 ) .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to perform such analyses and derive the most reliable results from the faint nir galaxies in the sdf .",
    "generally there are many parameters and systematic uncertainties in the theoretical prediction of galaxy counts , and this has also been one of the origins of the controversy in this field . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive survey of systematic uncertainties in the model used here , by which the readers can check how our results could be affected by model uncertainties .",
    "we try to make our conclusions unbiased as far as possible after careful examination of such uncertainties .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical model of galaxy formation and evolution used in this paper is described in  [ section : model ] .",
    "the procedure to compare the model and sdf data taking into account the selection effects and completeness is described in ",
    "[ section : confronting ] in detail .",
    "the results of comparison of various models versus observed counts , colors and size distributions are given in ",
    "[ section : results ] .",
    "the summary of this paper will be given in ",
    "[ section : summary ] .",
    "the theoretical model used here is based on the present - day properties of galaxies and their observed luminosity function ( lf ) , and it probes the evolution backward in time ( tinsley 1980 ; yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1990 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; yoshii & peterson 1991 , 1995 ; pozzetti et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "we use the same model as that used in ty00 to analyze the hdf galaxies , and here we summarize important properties of the model .",
    "galaxies are classified into five morphological types of e / s0 , sab , sbc , scd , and sdm , and their evolution of luminosity and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is described by a standard galaxy evolution model in which the star formation history is determined to reproduce the present - day colors and chemical properties of galaxies ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 ) .",
    "we will also try a similar but independent evolution model by kobayashi , tsujimoto , & nomoto ( 2000 ) based on a different stellar population database ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) , to see a typical uncertainty concerning stellar population synthesis models .",
    "type mix is determined by the type - dependent present - day lf as described below .",
    "all galaxies are simply assumed to be formed at a single redshift , @xmath22 , and the sensitivity of our conclusion to this uncertain parameter will be checked by changing this parameter in a range of @xmath22 = 310 .    the number density of galaxies is normalized at @xmath23 by the @xmath24-band local lf of galaxies , and @xmath24-band magnitude is translated into any band of interest by using the colors of model galaxies which are dependent on galaxy types .",
    "this treatment makes it possible to predict multiband galaxy counts with a consistent normalization .",
    "therefore the local @xmath0-band lf is an output of our model , and it will be compared with the observations of the local @xmath0-band lf .",
    "we use several published b - band lfs ( the ssrs2 survey , marzke et al .",
    "1998 ; the apm survey , loveday et al .",
    "1992 ; the cfa survey , huchra et al . 1983 ) which are either type - dependent or type - independent .",
    "it should be noted that we will try considerably different morphological type mixes by this treatment , and hence we can estimate the sensitivity of the model prediction to the adopted morphological type mix , as well as to the lf .",
    "their schechter parameters are tabulated in table 1 of ty00 . in all these lfs ,",
    "the e / s0 galaxies , whose relative proportion is more significant in the nir than in the optical , is treated as a single population . however , in this paper we will find that the model with such lfs does not fit well to the faintest @xmath0 counts , and we will investigate a lf in which the giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies are treated as distinct populations .",
    "this treatment is motivated by local observations for giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies in groups and clusters of galaxies ( see  [ section : gde ] ) .",
    "we should examine whether our model is consistent with the local @xmath0-band luminosity function , because the normalization of galaxy number density of our model is set by the @xmath24-band luminosity function as mentioned above .",
    "this can be done easily by translating the @xmath24-band luminosity function used in ty00 by the colors of model galaxies at @xmath23 which is dependent on the galaxy types .",
    "figure [ fig : k - lf ] shows the comparison of the model @xmath0-band lf obtained in such a way with the observed @xmath0-band luminosity function in the literature .",
    "the figure shows that our model is well consistent with the @xmath0-band lf data , and there is no problem in the normalization of galaxy number density at @xmath23 , although the normalization is set by the @xmath24-band lf rather than the @xmath0 band .",
    "absorptions by interstellar dust and intergalactic hi clouds are taken into account .",
    "the dust opacity is assumed to be proportional to the gas column density and metallicity , and we adopt two models of spatial distribution of dust such as the intervening screen model and the slab ( i.e. , the same distribution for stars and dust ) model . the observed correlation between the power - law index of uv spectra and the balmer line ratio of starburst galaxies indicates that the observed reddening of starburst galaxies is larger than expected from the slab model , and at least some fraction of dust should behave like a screen ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) .",
    "we then use the screen model as a standard , and use the slab model to check the uncertainties . finally , we use the optical depth calculated by yoshii & peterson ( 1994 ) for intergalactic absorption by hi clouds . however , the absorption of intergalactic hi clouds is almost negligible at the @xmath0 band for galaxies with @xmath25 .",
    "the size and surface brightness profile of galaxies are very important for the detectability of faint galaxies , and it must be modeled when the selection effects are taken into consideration .",
    "the exponential and de vaucouleurs law are assumed for the surface brightness profiles of spiral and elliptical galaxies , respectively .",
    "we then assume that the effective radius , @xmath26 , which is the scale in the exponents , is independent of observed wavelength .",
    "we use the relation between the @xmath24-band luminosity and @xmath26 estimated by fitting to observed @xmath24-band luminostiy profile of local galaxies , to calculate @xmath26 as a function of the present - day @xmath24-band luminosity .",
    "it should be noted that , although the effective radius is the same , the observed size of high-@xmath27 or faint galaxies can be considerably different in different observation bands , because of different sensitivities for surface brightness . indeed , these effects ( the so - called morphological k - correction ) are taken into account in our analysis ( see the next section ) .",
    "the relation of the present @xmath24 luminosity @xmath28 and effective radius @xmath26 is assumed to be a power - law as @xmath29 for each galaxy type , and the normalization and @xmath30 are determined by fits to the empirical relation observed for local galaxies .",
    "there is a considerable scatter in the empirical @xmath26-@xmath28 relation ( about 0.22 in @xmath31 ) , and the systematic uncertainty due to this scatter will be checked ( see ty00 and  [ section : uncertainty ] ) . in most of our calculations ( except in  [ section : size ] ) , we assume that the size evolution of galaxies occurs only when there is number evolution of galaxies .",
    "the size evolution which may happen even when there is no merging of galaxies , which we call ` intrinsic ' size evolution , will be tested in  [ section : size ] .    there may be systematic biases in the estimate of effective radius by the @xmath24-band luminosity profile .",
    "one possible origin of bias is dust extinction .",
    "the dust opacity is larger in the central region of galaxies , and then the optical scale length , which is more severely affected by extinction , tends to be larger than that estimated by the near - infrared luminosity profile . for elliptical galaxies , pahre , de carvalho , & djorgovski ( 1998 ) found @xmath32 .",
    "difference of @xmath26 between @xmath24 and @xmath33 bands can be inferred from the mean color gradient @xmath34 ( sparks & jrgensen 1993 ) , and then we obtain @xmath35 . for spiral galaxies , the difference in @xmath26",
    "is found as @xmath36 ( for face - on spiral galaxies , de jong 1996 ) and @xmath37 ( for edge - on spiral galaxies , de grijs 1998 ) .",
    "these biases are within the range of the scatter in @xmath26-@xmath28 relation mentioned above , and hence the systematic uncertainty in galaxy counts by these biases is also checked in  [ section : uncertainty ] .",
    "a simple picture for galaxy evolution is a so - called pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) model in which there is no number evolution of galaxies to high redshifts ( tinsley 1980 ; yoshii & takahara 1988 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1990 ; rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; yoshii & peterson 1991 , 1995 ; pozzetti et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "however , some number evolution is naturally expected in the hierarchically clustering universe dominated by cold dark matter , which is the standard theory of structure formation ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1984 ; kauffmann , white , guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al . 1994 ) . in order to investigate the possible number evolution of galaxies we introduce a simple merger model characterized by the evolution of the schechter parameters of lfs , in which the total luminosity density is conserved , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; yoshii 1993 ) .",
    "for the simplicity , we assume that all types of galaxies have the same number evolution . indeed ,",
    "later in this paper (  [ section : cosmology ] ) we will find that this seems not the case in reality .",
    "this model is clearly a simplified picture of galaxy merging ignoring the possible starbursts induced by mergers , and this point should be kept in mind in the following analysis .",
    "the size evolution induced by the number evolution is modeled by a parameter @xmath38 , in which the characteristic luminosity and size of individual galaxies satisfy a scaling relation @xmath39 during the merger process . if the surface brightness or stellar luminosity density within a galaxy is not changed in mergers , this parameter becomes @xmath40 or 3 , respectively .",
    "conversion of merging kinetic energy into random stellar motions would make @xmath38 smaller , while dissipation of gas would have an inverse effect .",
    "we assume @xmath41 in this paper as a reference value , but the prediction of galaxy counts is actually almost insensitive to @xmath38 in a reasonable range of @xmath42 24 , unless extremely strong number evolution ( @xmath43 ) is invoked .",
    "here we describe in detail the procedure used to compare the observed data in the sdf and the theoretical model .",
    "the systematic selection effects taken into account are as follows : ( 1 ) apparent size and surface brightness profiles of galaxies where the cosmological dimming is taken into account , ( 2 ) dimming of an image by seeing , ( 3 ) detection criteria of galaxies under the observational conditions of sdf , ( 4 ) completeness of galaxy detection , and ( 5 ) photometric scheme and its measurement error . in this paper",
    "we use isophotal magnitudes consistently for the data and the theoretical model , unless otherwise stated , to avoid uncertainties in extending the photometry beyond the detection isophote .",
    "the detection criteria of the sdf is briefly summarized below .",
    "see maihara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the observations and detail of data reduction .",
    "the reduced sdf frames are first smoothed out by a gaussian filter with the image resolution of @xmath44 in fwhm",
    ". then the detection thresholds are defined at the 1.50 @xmath45 level of surface brightness fluctuation in the sky , which corresponds to the threshold surface brightness ( detection isophote ) of @xmath46 = 25.59 mag arcsec@xmath47 in the @xmath15 band and 24.10 mag arcsec@xmath47 in the @xmath16 band .",
    "objects with isophotal area of 18 pixels ( @xmath48 = 0.24 arcsec@xmath49 ) or more above the detection isophote are registered as sources detected . therefore , the faintest isophotal magnitude of objects detected by the sdf is @xmath50 . for reference",
    ", we plot the total and isophotal @xmath16 magnitudes estimated by maihara et al .",
    "( 2000 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag - mag ] , for galaxies detected not only in the @xmath16 band but also in the @xmath15 band , to remove spurious noise objects .",
    "this plot shows that our analysis will probe galaxies with total magnitudes of @xmath51 , which corresponds to @xmath52 sigma level .",
    "since we have modeled the galaxy size and the profile of surface brightness profiles , we can calculate the isophotal area and isophotal magnitude of a given galaxy at arbitrary redshift , by using @xmath46 of sdf .",
    "therefore the above detection criteria can be incorporated in the theoretical prediction of raw galaxy counts .",
    "the cosmological dimming of surface brightness and morphological k - corrections are included here .",
    "see ty00 for technical details .",
    "now we present the raw galaxy counts observed in the sdf as a function of isophotal @xmath16 magnitude , which will be compared with theoretical prediction taking into account selection effects .",
    "table [ table : counts ] shows the number of detected objects @xmath53 , the number of noise objects estimated by the mean of noise frames @xmath54 , the expected number of detected galaxies @xmath55 ) , the galaxy counts @xmath56 [",
    "/mag / deg@xmath49 ] estimated from @xmath58 , and its error estimated by @xmath59 . in this paper we translate the @xmath16 magnitudes into @xmath0 by the formula @xmath60 based on the typical colors of sdf galaxies .",
    "this translation generally depends on colors of galaxies as @xmath61 , but dispersion of @xmath1 color is less than 2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : color ] ) , and hence ignoring the color dependence would generate systematic error of at most 0.1 mag , which hardly affects the analysis in this paper .",
    "in addition , the magnitude referred here and throughout the paper is not the ab magnitude , but the conventional @xmath0 magnitude ( e.g. , johnson 1966 ) .",
    "here we discuss the effect of angular correlation of galaxies which could lead to the systematic uncertainty in the count estimates .",
    "considering an angular area of @xmath62 , with a mean count of @xmath63 galaxies , the variance of number of detected galaxies is increased to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the angular correlation function of galaxies and @xmath66 is the angle between the points @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the angular correlation function for faint galaxies has been measured in the @xmath0 band by a number of papers ( e.g. , baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; carlberg et al . 1997 ; roche et al .",
    "1999 ) , and it is described in a form of @xmath69 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath70 at fixed @xmath71 is a decreasing function of @xmath0 magnitude , while there is some evidence that the amplitude becomes relatively flat at @xmath72 with a value of @xmath73 when @xmath71 is measured in degree ( roche et al .",
    "1999 ) . here",
    "we assume the amplitude - magnitude relation does not turn over at @xmath72 , which is theoretically reasonable ( e.g. , roche & eales 1999 ) , to set the upper limit on the uncertainty of galaxy counts coming from clustering of galaxies . for the @xmath74 area of the sdf ,",
    "the variance becomes @xmath75 .",
    "the number of detected sdf galaxies per each magnitude bin of table [ table : counts ] is larger than @xmath76 30 at @xmath77 and , with the above value of @xmath70 , the standard deviation for @xmath78 is @xmath79 . in table",
    "[ table : sensitivity ] , we show the combined error coming from poisson statistics and clustering , at representative three magnitudes of @xmath80 , 23.25 , and 24.75 , along with other model uncertainties which will be discussed later in detail .      because of the noise and statistical fluctuations , the source detection is not complete even if true magnitude and size of a source meet the criteria described in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath16 band detection completeness of sdf estimated by simulations is shown as a function of total magnitude , for a source having a gaussian profile with several values of fwhm by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp - k ] .",
    "the incompleteness is caused by the fluctuation of isophotal area by noise , that often leads to the observed isophotal area smaller than the threshold isophotal area , even if the true isophotal area is larger than the threshold .",
    "we model this incompleteness as follows , in the theoretical prediction of raw galaxy counts .",
    "we found that the dispersion of observed isophotal area from the true value can be fitted by the following empirical formula : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the total magnitude and fwhm size of an object , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 the isophotal area corresponding to the isophotal level 0.8 and 1.2 times brighter than @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath86 is determined to reproduce the result of simulations . assuming a gaussian distribution of observed isophotal area with the above dispersion",
    ", we can calculate the probability that the observed isophotal area is larger than the threshold value @xmath48 .",
    "we plotted this probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp - k ] by dashed lines , and this result shows that the above empirical formula gives a reasonable estimate of the completeness .    for each model galaxy , we calculate the isophotal size and isophotal magnitude , and then the detection probability from the above formula .",

    "the practical method to calculate the isophotal area of the image of a model galaxy with given redshift and isophotal magnitude , after gaussian smoothing ( @xmath44 in fwhm for sdf ) of either an exponential or de vaucouleurs s profile , has been given in ty00 .",
    "the photometric error in the estimate of magnitudes in the faint end may be significant , and may modify the slope of @xmath87-@xmath82 relation . here",

    "now we can calculate the observed raw counts @xmath96 in which all the observational selection effects mentioned above are taken into account using a realistic model of galaxy evolution , and we will compare the counts as well as size and color distributions with the sdf data in the following of this paper .",

    "we conclude from these results that the prediction of galaxy counts depends mostly on cosmology and number evolution with @xmath113 . the total systematic uncertainty in count prediction except for cosmology and number evolution is smaller than the difference between @xmath4 and open universes , and less than one third of the difference between @xmath4 and eds universes .",
    "although our survey of model uncertainties may not be perfect , it does not seem so easy to change the count prediction as large as the effect of cosmological models or number evolution by choosing different values for other parameters in galaxy evolution .      the low - density , @xmath4-dominated flat universe is currently the most favored from various observational constraints , such as the fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( de bernardis et al . 2000 ) or high-@xmath27 type ia supernova data ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "although some systematic uncertainties may still remain in these results ( see , e.g. , aguirre 1999 ; totani & kobayashi 1999 ) , the @xmath4-dominated flat universe is becoming a standard cosmological model .",
    "in fact , ty00 has performed the first comprehensive comparison between hdf galaxies and realistic theoretical models taking into account various selection effects , and shown that the galaxy counts and photometric redshift distributions in the hdf are simultaneously reproduced best in the @xmath4-dominated flat universe .",
    "the ple model in an open universe or the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe underpredicts the observed counts , and even a strong number evolution , if invoked to match the observed counts in a way that luminosity density is conserved , is still seriously inconsistent with the slope of optical counts ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) and photometric redshift distributions .",
    "a similar result has recently been obtained by he et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "then we discuss here implications of the sdf counts assuming this popular @xmath4-dominated flat universe . in this universe ,",
    "the observed sdf counts are in reasonable agreement with the ple model prediction at @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that there is almost no room for a number evolution of galaxies with @xmath113 , otherwise the galaxy counts would be seriously overproduced as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts - lam - merge ] .",
    "this constraint especially applies to relatively giant galaxies with @xmath116 , since the flattening of the @xmath117 slope beyond @xmath118 , where this constraint is obtained , is caused by @xmath119 galaxies at @xmath120 .",
    "it is in sharp contrast to the case of hdf counts which rather favor a modest number evolution with @xmath10 ( ty00 ) .",
    "this discrepancy may come from a clearly too simple assumption in the modeling of the number evolution , i.e. , the same number evolution for all types of galaxies .",
    "we suggest that this apparent discrepancy is due to type - dependent number evolution of galaxies , because the dominant population consists of late - type galaxies in the optical bands whereas early - type galaxies in the near - infrared bands .",
    "therefore , the optical hdf and near - infrared sdf data could be consistently explained if there is some number evolution in late - type galaxies , while almost no number evolution in early - type or elliptical galaxies .",
    "to verify this hypothesis , we plot the model predictions where early type galaxies ( e / s0 and/or sab ) have no number evolution , while ohter types have number evolution with @xmath10 , in fig . [",
    "fig : counts - lam - merge2 ] . as shown in the figure , number evolution of galaxies later than sbc hardly changes the count prediction in the @xmath0 band from the ple model for all types .    on the other hand , it is also worth considering what degree of number evolution is necessary to match other cosmological models to the data .",
    "figure [ fig : counts - eds - merge ] is the same as figure [ fig : counts - lam - merge ] , but for the case of the eds universe .",
    "a number evolution driven by mergers with @xmath6 can reconcile the observed @xmath0 counts and the eds universe , provided @xmath121 .",
    "we also found that this number evolution model is consistent also with the @xmath1-color and size distributions which will be discussed in the next section , and hence the sdf data alone can not discriminate between the ple model in the @xmath4-dominated universe and the number evolution model in the eds universe . however , as described above , the @xmath4-dominated universe is now becoming a standard cosmological model .",
    "in fact , ty00 has shown that a strong number evolution of @xmath122 4 is required to match the eds universe with the hdf counts .",
    "such a strong number evolution does not seem to be favored by observations .",
    "le fvre et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that typical l * galaxies have experienced about 1 major merger from @xmath123 to 0 , from the hst images of the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ) galaxies .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath10 which is consistent with the result of ty00 , and disfavors too large @xmath112 . we will consider the @xmath4-ple model as the standard in the following of this paper .      here",
    "we discuss some possible interpretations of the excess of @xmath0 counts beyond that predicted by the @xmath4-ple model at @xmath11 .",
    "a simple interpretation for this is number evolution which can not simply be expressed by the phenomenological form used in this paper .",
    "the number evolution investigated in this paper assumes the same number evolution in all luminosity range , and such evolution would overproduce the relatively bright counts at @xmath124 , even if it may fit to the faintest counts of @xmath125 , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : counts - lam - merge ] .",
    "a possible scenario is then that number evolution is especially stronger for dwarf galaxies with no or weaker number evolution for giant early - type galaxies , in order not to violate the counts at @xmath124 .",
    "but here we give another possibility , in which an evidence for dwarf elliptical galaxies observed at the local universe gives a natural explanation for the excess . in the above ple model",
    "the elliptical galaxies are treated as a single population having a single lf .",
    "however , it is known that the present - day giant elliptical galaxies with @xmath126 and dwarf elliptical galaxies with @xmath127 are distinct populations showing different luminosity profiles ( the @xmath128 law for giants , while exponential for dwarfs ) and different luminosity - size relations ( see , e.g. , ferguson & binggeli 1994 for a review ) . in the k - band , this critical magnitude corresponds to @xmath129 from the typical color of elliptical galaxies ( see fig . [",
    "fig : k - lf ] ) .",
    "since the contribution of early - type galaxies is more significant in the near - infrared than in the optical , it is important to take into account such distinct populations of elliptical galaxies in predicting the @xmath0 counts in the sdf .",
    "we then model the giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies separately .",
    "it is known that the present - day lf of giant elliptical galaxies is well described by a gaussian - like shape rather than the schechter function , while the lf of dwarf elliptical galaxies can be fitted by the schechter function with @xmath130 ( e.g. , ferguson & sandage 1991 ; thompson & gregory 1993 ) .",
    "the normalizations of these two populations are roughly the same in poor groups , while the ratio @xmath131 seems to increase monotonically with the richness of galaxy groups up to the rich clusters . here , following chiba & yoshii ( 1999 ) , we adopt the lfs of these two populations with @xmath132 for giants and @xmath133 for dwarfs ( @xmath134 ) . the normalization of @xmath135 is used in common for both giants and dwarfs , while a factor @xmath136 with @xmath137 is multiplied to the faint end of giants lf to match their observed gaussian - like lf .",

    "[ fig : k - lf ] .",
    "this lf is again consistent with the observed @xmath0-band lf , and difference from the other lf models can be seen only in the faint end of @xmath138 .",
    "thus , this model of lf should be considered as one of possible lfs within the observational constraints .",
    "the uncertainty of the present - day lf has the most significant effect in the faintest magnitudes of galaxy counts .",
    "the evidence of the two distinct populations can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : l - size - e ] , where the luminosity - size relation of local elliptical / spheroidal galaxies is shown .",

    "the de vaucouleurs law ( @xmath128 law ) is adopted as the surface brightness profile for giants while the exponential law for dwarfs , as observed .",
    "finally , the galaxy evolution model of arimoto & yoshii ( 1987 ) with smaller mass of @xmath139 is used for dwarfs , while the @xmath140 model for giants which is the same as that used in the previous sections where elliptical galaxies have been treated as a single population .",
    "figure [ fig : counts - gde ] shows the prediction of @xmath0 counts by the @xmath4-ple model with distinct giant and dwarf elliptical populations described above .",
    "as can be seen , the transition of giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies occurs at @xmath141 2122 , which corresponds to @xmath129 at the local universe .",
    "this two - population model is in excellent agreement with the observed counts over the entire range of @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "therefore , the excess of the observed counts at @xmath11 beyond the ple - model prediction with a single elliptical population can naturally be interpreted as the emergence of a distinct population of dwarf elliptical galaxies that have been observed in the local universe .",
    "the count around @xmath142 20 is also better reproduced by this model , than the previous model whose counts were systematically higher than the sdf data . in that case number evolution",
    "is not necessary to explain the faintest sdf counts .",
    "it is difficult to discriminate the two interpretations ( i.e. , number evolution or distinct elliptical populations ) from the current data because of the uncertainty in the faint - end slope of the present - day lf . in the rest of this paper",

    "the theoretically expected redshift extends to @xmath8 12 , and the implications obtained by this paper , such as the constraint on the number evolution in the @xmath4-dominated universe , should apply galaxies in this redshift range . as expected , the redshift distribution from the eds merger model has a peak at lower redshifts when compared with the standard @xmath4-ple model .",
    "this difference , though not sufficiently large , may be used to discriminate between the two models .",
    "the dashed line is the redshift distribution from the standard @xmath4-ple model , which is the same as shown by the solid line , but for total @xmath0 magnitudes with the selection effects not taken into account in the model .",
    "it should be noted that the selection effects are only weakly dependent on redshift , in contrast to the case of the hdf , as demonstrated in ty00 and in the analysis of extragalactic background light by totani et al .",
    "the difference from the hdf is due to the fact that image sizes of the sdf galaxies are about 5 times larger than the hdf galaxies .",
    "when the surface brightness is made fainter by larger image size , this non - cosmological dimming becomes dominant compared with the cosmological surface brightness dimming , and the redshift dependence of the selection effects should become weaker . in other words , the cosmological dimming is especially serious when a good sensitivity is achieved by good image resolution rather than large telescope diameter as in the case of the hst .",
    "in this paper we presented a detailed study for the comparison between the near - infrared galaxy counts , colors , and size distributions observed in the subaru deep field ( sdf ) which is one of the deepest nir images of the universe , and theoretical models probing galaxy formation / evolution backward in time based on the present - day properties and number density of galaxies observed at @xmath23 .",
    "we have paid special attention in taking into account various selection effects consistently in the models , to avoid systematic biases which may have been a possible origin of controversial previous results .",
    "the selection effects considered here are ( 1 ) apparent size and surface brightness profiles of galaxies where the cosmological dimming is taken into account , ( 2 ) dimming of an image by seeing , ( 3 ) detection criteria of galaxies under the observational conditions of sdf , ( 4 ) completeness of galaxy detection estimated by simulations of sdf , and ( 5 ) photometric scheme and its measurement error .",
    "( the isophotal or aperture magnitudes are used in a self - consistent way . )",
    "the selection effects are found to be negligible at @xmath151 21 in the conditions of the sdf , and the conclusion in this paper is not affected by uncertainty coming from these effects down to this magnitude limit .",
    "careful treatment of the selection effects described above enabled us to investigate much fainter galaxies down to isophotal @xmath152 or total @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , it is statistically unlikely that the angular clustering of galaxies affects the following results",
    ".    we also examined as far as possible the systematic uncertainties in the galaxy evolution models used here , and have shown that the galaxy count prediction mostly depends on cosmology and number evolution , and other examined dependence on model parameters or uncertainties are smaller than the two .",
    "therefore , though our survey of systematic uncertainties may not be perfect , we consider that it is not easy to change the conclusions derived below by choosing other model parameters of galaxy evolution or taking into account the uncertainties .",
    "we have found that the conventional pure - luminosity - evolution model ( ple ) in a @xmath4-dominated flat universe ( @xmath4-ple model ) is well consistent with the observed sdf counts , color , and size distributions down to isophotal @xmath3 , without any signature of number evolution ( @xmath153 ) , where the number evolution is parametrized as @xmath6 and @xmath7 for all types of galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "a number evolution of @xmath5 is necessary to explain the data in the einstein - de sitter universe .    the @xmath4-dominated universe is now favored by various cosmological observations , and here we discuss several implications from our results , assuming that this universe is the true model .",

    "the sdf data also suggest a possibility of some number evolution of dwarf galaxies . we have already found some evidence for number evolution of galaxies observed in the optical bands in the hubble deep field ( hdf ) ( ty00 ) .",
    "since late - type spiral galaxies become a dominant population at optical wavelengths , such a discrepant view of number evolution from the near - infrared sdf and optical hdf data likely reflects the type - dependence of merger history of galaxies , i.e. , stronger number evolution for later type galaxies .",
    "these conclusions place interesting constraints on the merger history of galaxies in the framework of hierarchically clustering scenario in the cdm universe ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1984 ; kauffmann , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "recently phillipps et al .",
    "( 2000 ) analyzed the number counts of e / s0 galaxies which are selected thanks to the good resolution of hst , and they derived a considerably different conclusion from ours : the eds universe with simple passive evolution gives an excellent fit to the e / s0 counts .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy with our study is not clear , but here we mention several possible origins .",
    "first , morphological selection of galaxies sometimes leads to serious systematic bias especially when it is used to study number evolution of a selected galaxy type .",
    "galaxies may have different morphology when observed at different wavelength ( i.e. , morphological @xmath157-correction ) , and there may also be physical transition of morphological type .",
    "even if elliptical galaxies have formed at high redshift and then evolved passively , morphology of a galaxy which is observed as an elliptical galaxy at @xmath23 may not be recognized as an elliptical galaxy at high redshifts because younger stellar population still exists at young age of the galaxy and it may not reach dynamical relaxation .",
    "such possible systematic effect is difficult to check , but could lead to systematic bias when we study number evolution or cosmology by number counts of a selected galaxy type .",
    "second , it seems that the selection effects against high-@xmath27 galaxies are not included in phillipps et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and this may have resulted in loss of high-@xmath27 galaxies extended by the cosmological dimming effect .",
    "in fact , the selection effects are already becoming important at @xmath158 ( see fig .",
    "6 of ty00 ) .",
    "note that the selection effects against extended sources are more serious in hdf than sdf , because the good sensitivity of hst is achieved by good resolution rather than the telescope diameter .",
    "third , the luminosity evolution is assumed in a simple form of @xmath159 in phillipps et al .",
    "it may be a good approximation at low redshift , but a clearly too simple modeling at high redshifts .",
    "our model is based on a more realistic luminosity and sed evolution model and especially , it includes dust absorption .",
    "as shown by ty00 , it is naturally expected that elliptical galaxies at starburst phase are very dusty and hard to detect in optical wavelengths .",
    "we have found a slight excess of observed counts compared with the ple prediction at @xmath11 , which may be a signature of some number evolution for dwarf galaxies .",
    "however we have also shown that this excess can naturally be resolved within the @xmath4-ple model , if we treat giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies separately as distinct populations having different luminosity functions and surface brightness profiles , as suggested by observations of elliptical galaxies in local groups and clusters ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ; ferguson & sandage 1991 ; thompson & gregory 1993 ) .",
    "the faintest counts are sensitive to the faint - end of the local lf which is poorly constrained by observation , and it does not allow us to derive strong conclusions at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "the @xmath1-color and size distributions of the sdf galaxies are also well explained by both of the two models which can explain the sdf counts , i.e. , the ple model in @xmath4-dominated flat universe and the merging model ( @xmath5 ) in the eds universe , and there is no evidence for intrinsic size evolution not caused by number evolution .",
