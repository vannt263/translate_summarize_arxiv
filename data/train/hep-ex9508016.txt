    "leading order ( lo ) qcd predicts photon interactions to have a two - component nature . in direct",
    "photon processes the whole of the photon takes part in the hard subprocess with a parton from the proton whereas in resolved photon processes , the photon acts as a source of partons and one of these enters the hard subprocess ( see figure [ fig : diresfig ] ) .",
    "both lo processes are characterized by having two outgoing partons of large transverse energy .",
    "previous studies of dijet photoproduction at hera have shown that both classes of process are evident for the case of quasi - real photons ( those of negligible virtuality @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "the parton content of photons is neither well constrained theoretically nor well known experimentally , particularly for photons with small but non - zero virtualities .",
    "various theoretical predictions exist for the behaviour of the photon structure as a function of the photon virtuality @xcite .",
    "the general expectation is that the contribution to the dijet cross section of resolved photon processes should decrease relative to the contribution from direct photon processes ( _ i.e. _ that the partonic content of the photon is suppressed ) as the virtuality of the photon increases .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected during the 1994 run when hera collided 27.5 gev positrons with 820 gev protons .",
    "the zeus detector is described elsewhere@xcite .",
    "a tungsten - silicon sampling calorimeter was installed for the 1994 running period .",
    "this beampipe calorimeter tagged positrons scattered through small angles ( 17 - 35 mrad ) and gave a sample of events with photon virtualities in the range @xmath7 gev@xmath2 .",
    "a sample of events with quasi - real photons ( @xmath3 gev@xmath2 with a median of @xmath8 gev@xmath2 ) was obtained by requiring that the scattered positron be detected in the downstream luminosity calorimeter@xcite .",
    "jets were found in the main uranium - scintillator@xcite calorimeter using a cone algorithm @xcite in @xmath9 - @xmath10 space , where @xmath11 is azimuth and the pseudo rapidity @xmath12 , @xmath13 being defined with respect to the proton direction . only those events with two or more jets of transverse energy @xmath4 gev in the range @xmath14 were selected as dijet events . to reduce contamination from beam gas and deep inelastic scattering events , a cut of @xmath15 was applied , where the sum is over calorimeter cells with deposits of total and longitudinal energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively and where @xmath18 is the positron beam energy . in photoproduction , @xmath19 is the fraction of the positron energy carried by the photon .",
    "these cuts left a sample of 375 events with virtual photons and a sample of 14181 events with quasi - real photons , corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 2.07 pb@xmath20 and 2.19 pb@xmath20 .",
    "for each dijet event the fraction of the photon momentum manifest in the two highest @xmath6 jets , @xmath5 was calculated .",
    "@xmath5 is defined by    @xmath21 we measure @xmath22 and @xmath23 using the raw calorimeter energies and use the jaquet - blondel method , @xmath24 above , to measure @xmath19 .",
    "no corrections are made for detector effects .",
    "uncorrected distributions of @xmath5 are shown in figure [ fig : xgfig ] a ) for events with virtual photons and figure [ fig : xgfig ] b ) for events with quasi - real photons .",
    "events at high @xmath5 are associated with direct photon processes while those at low @xmath5 are associated with resolved photon processes .",
    "it is clear that both classes of event are present in both @xmath0 ranges . to quantify the relative contributions of these classes of event",
    ", we have calculated the ratio @xmath25 , defined as the number of events at low @xmath5 ( @xmath26 ) divided by the number of events at high @xmath5 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : resdirfig ] shows @xmath25 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath25 is independent of @xmath24 for the sample of events with quasi - real photons passing all the cuts applied .",
    "this implies that the difference in the @xmath5 distributions for the two samples is not due to the differing @xmath24 acceptances of the two positron detectors .",
    "the acceptance corrections that will eventually be applied to these data are only weakly dependent on @xmath5 and we therefore expect the corrections to @xmath25 to be small .",
    "more work is required to understand fully these corrections however . in conclusion",
    "we find the preliminary result that for events with photons of virtuality @xmath28 gev@xmath2 there is a contribution from resolved photon processes .",
    "the size of this contribution relative to that from direct photon processes seems to decrease with increasing photon virtuality .",
