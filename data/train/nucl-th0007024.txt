    "halo nuclei are the most intriguing objects among recent nuclear physics discoveries .",
    "their small binding energies and large spatial extensions had no precedent and were totally unexpected in the realm of systems governed by the nuclear force .",
    "borromean two  neutron halo systems show the additional peculiarity that the three  body ( core+@xmath5+@xmath5 ) system completely falls apart when either of the three constituents drops out . among the latter @xmath1he ( @xmath2+@xmath5+@xmath5 )",
    "is the one that is most stable and has been extensively studied .",
    "since the initial discovery by tanihata and collaborators @xcite , much progress has been made in theoretical @xcite and experimental studies of halo nuclei .",
    "the available experimental information comes basically from nucleus  nucleus collisions @xcite .",
    "this experimental information has the inherent difficulty of disentangling nuclear reaction mechanisms from nuclear structure effects .",
    "this is why the idea of using nonhadronic probes to obtain complementary information on halo nuclei has been put forward .",
    "the aim of this paper is to point out that , as for the case of stable nuclei , detailed information on charge density and momentum distributions in these systems can be obtained with electron beams . to this end",
    "we show theoretical results on differential cross sections and structure functions for the case of electron scattering from @xmath1he .",
    "we do not discuss here important technical difficulties stemming from the short lives of halo nuclei and small production rates , which work against the feasibility of experiments involving measurements of cross sections for electron scattering from a halo  nucleus secondary beam .",
    "we just mention that in spite of these difficulties such experiments are in project at riken @xcite , and are also being considered at gsi and mainz .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the first theoretical study of electron scattering from halo nuclei was presented in ref.@xcite . in this reference",
    "we developed the formalism focusing on elastic scattering and on exclusive @xmath6 and @xmath7 coincidence experiments .",
    "in particular we studied the reactions @xmath1he(@xmath8)@xmath9 and @xmath1he(@xmath10)@xmath11 using a @xmath1he three ",
    "body wave function that describes accurately all presently known phenomenology .",
    "the results that we present and discuss here are based on that previous work , where details of calculations can be found .",
    "determination of the spectral function requires coincidence measurements in exclusive experiments . since the complexity of these experiments is high , it is natural to think that inclusive @xmath12 experiments , in which only the scattered electron is detected , will be the ones to be performed first . moreover , it is difficult to select adequate kinematical conditions for exclusive experiments due to the large number of variables ( energy and momentum transfer ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) and energy and direction of the knocked out particle ) . in this regard",
    "it is mandatory to know first what are the ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) domains where the quasielastic peaks for @xmath2 knockout and halo neutron knockout dominate the total ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) differential cross section for the halo nucleus .",
    "for the first time we show here results on inclusive scattering over an ( @xmath17 ) region that allows to visualize the appearance of different quasielastic @xmath15@xmath2 and @xmath15@xmath5 peaks in different kinematical regions .",
    "we also show that coincidence measurements in this separate kinematical regions allow to determine the spectral functions of the core and the halo neutrons , and thus the detailed structure of the three",
    " body wave function in momentum space .",
    "to probe the structure of the three  body wave function of two  neutron halo nuclei we consider the reaction sketched in fig.[fig1 ] . the collision between the electron and the target",
    "is taken as a process in which one of the three constituents in the target absorbs the whole energy and momentum transfer ( @xmath13,@xmath18 ) and is knocked out from the target .",
    "core excitations and core breakup reactions are not considered here , and the inclusive cross section @xmath19 can then be computed as the sum of three terms corresponding to the absorption of the virtual photon by each of the three constituents in the halo nucleus . in the same way",
    "the structure functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 are given by the sum of the elementary structure functions @xmath22 corresponding to a process where the constituent @xmath23 absorbs the virtual photon .",
    "in the particular case of @xmath1he , since the @xmath2core has zero spin , one has @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the reaction shown in fig.[fig1 ] the incident and scattered",
    "electrons as well as the ejected particle ( constituent @xmath23 ) are described as plane waves ( plane wave impulse approximation ) .",
    "since we are dealing with a borromean target the residual two  body system made by particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 is in the continuum , and the final interaction between them is included in the calculation .",
    "working in the frame of the halo nucleus ( @xmath28 ) the differential cross section of the process shown in fig.[fig1 ] is :    @xmath29    where the different momenta and energies are shown in the figure .",
    "@xmath30 is the relative momentum between particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the final state .",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the masses of the halo constituents @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the total mass of the halo nucleus , respectively .",
    "@xmath34 is the kinetic energy of the system made by particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 referred to its own center of mass and @xmath35 its reduced mass .",
    "@xmath36 is the recoil factor , @xmath37 is the cross section for elastic electron scattering on constituent @xmath23 , and @xmath38 is the spectral function .",
    "the cross section @xmath37 takes the general form @xmath39 , where the @xmath40 s are kinematic factors and the @xmath41@xmath42s are structure functions associated to an electron scattering process on constituent @xmath23 . when this constituent has spin 0 ( as the @xmath2 particle in @xmath1he ) only the longitudinal structure function appears ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "@xmath38 is the spectral function , that is interpreted as the probability for the electron to remove a particle from the nucleus with internal momentum @xmath43 leaving the residual system with internal energy @xmath44 .",
    "this function contains the information about the nuclear structure , in particular it contains the whole dependence on the halo nucleus wave function and on the continuum wave function of the residual two  body system .",
    "it is defined as the square of the overlap between both wave functions , which reduces to the square of the fourier transform of the halo wave function when the final interaction between the two surviving constituents is neglected .",
    "the cross section for an inclusive quasielastic electron scattering process is obtained from eq.([eq1 ] ) after integration over the unobserved quantities , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath44 , and after summation over the index @xmath23 , that runs over all the three constituents of the halo nucleus , the two neutrons and the core . since the @xmath46 and @xmath47 terms in the cross section automatically disappear after integration over @xmath48 @xcite , one immediately recovers the expression in eq.([eq2 ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we discuss results for @xmath1he , that is described as a system made by an @xmath2-particle and two neutrons .",
    "compared to other halo nuclei @xmath1he has the advantage that the interactions between the constituents are well known , and that the @xmath2core is tightly bound .",
    "since the spin of the core is zero we get for @xmath1he @xmath49 where @xmath50    the neutron structure functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 are computed using the cc1 prescription for the nucleon current @xcite , and their analytic expressions are given in @xcite . the structure function @xmath53 is the square of the fourier transform of the @xmath2particle charge density .",
    "we use the experimental @xmath2 charge density parameterized as a sum of two gaussians as in table v of @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions of the spectral functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are given by eqs.(33 ) and ( 56 ) of @xcite .",
    "we use a three ",
    "body @xmath1he wave function obtained by solving the faddeev equations in coordinate space .",
    "the procedure is shown in detail in @xcite .",
    "the continuum wave function of the residual two  body system in the final state is written as a partial wave expansion @xcite whose radial functions are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation with the corresponding neutron  neutron or neutron@xmath2 potential . for the @xmath5-@xmath5 interaction we use a simple potential with gaussian shape including a central , spin ",
    "orbit , spin  spin , and tensor terms , whose parameters are adjusted to reproduce low energy neutron  neutron scattering data . for the @xmath5-@xmath2 interaction we use a potential with central and spin  orbit terms",
    "also with gaussian shapes and parameters adjusted to reproduce the phase shifts for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 waves up to 20 mev .",
    "these potentials provide an accurate description of the available information on @xmath1he .",
    "details about these potentials are given in @xcite .",
    "in the upper part of fig.[fig2 ] we show the longitudinal and transverse structure functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 for varying energy transfer @xmath13 at fixed values of the momentum transfer ( @xmath14=90 , 150 and 200 mev / c ) .",
    "note that for each @xmath14 the accessible @xmath13 values are constrained to be less than @xmath14 ( @xmath590 ) . in the upper  left part of fig.[fig2 ] we see that @xmath20 is dominated by the contribution of the @xmath2knockout . the latter",
    "is seen as a strong peak centered at @xmath60 , to which we refer as the @xmath2peak .",
    "the contribution from the halo neutrons to @xmath20 is not visible at the ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) values considered in this figure . for @xmath61 mev / c the @xmath2peak decreases while the contribution from the halo neutrons increases with increasing @xmath14 as the @xmath2 and neutron form factors , respectively . for",
    "@xmath14values beyond 250 mev / c the @xmath2peak gets shorter and shorter and the contribution to @xmath20 from halo neutrons shows up at @xmath62 mev .",
    "however , at this energy and momentum transfer this contribution may have a large overlap with the contribution from core breakup , i.e. , from one  nucleon knockout from the @xmath2particle .",
    "we have indicated with vertical arrows the @xmath13values where core breakup contributions may show up more . for @xmath13values to the left of the arrows @xmath20",
    "is dominated by the @xmath2peak .",
    "the structure function @xmath21 is shown in the upper ",
    "right part of fig.[fig2 ] . as already announced ,",
    "only the halo neutrons contribute to these peaks ( we refer to them as halo  neutron peaks ) which are seen to increase with increasing @xmath14values and are centered at @xmath13@xmath63@xmath64 .",
    "again we indicate by arrows the @xmath13values where core breakup contributions to @xmath21 will show up more .",
    "core breakup contributions to both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are expected to be more sizeable at @xmath14@xmath65250 mev / c and @xmath13@xmath6525 mev .",
    "typically data on one nucleon knockout from a free @xmath2particle are available at larger @xmath14values than those considered in fig.[fig2 ] @xcite .",
    "an estimate of the core breakup contributions to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 structure functions for inclusive @xmath1he(@xmath66 ) can be obtained from this reference for 280 mev / c @xmath67 720 mev / c .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath68he(@xmath66 ) extracted from this reference are @xmath20@xmath691.5 fm and @xmath21@xmath692 fm , which take place at @xmath14@xmath69360380 mev / c and @xmath13@xmath697080 mev .",
    "therefore the low ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) domain shown in the upper plots of fig.[fig2 ] appears to be optimal to obtain independent and reliable measurements of the @xmath2 and the halo neutron peaks , and thus on the momentum distributions of the different components of the three  body system .",
    "indeed , as seen in fig.[fig2 ] , @xmath20 provides information about the spectral function @xmath70 , corresponding to an @xmath2knockout process , while @xmath21 contains information about the spectral function @xmath71 , corresponding to a halo neutron knockout process .",
    "both spectral functions are shown in the lower part of the figure . from the plots one could naively think that @xmath21 is wider than @xmath20 because of the different widths of the corresponding spectral functions in the lower part of the figure .",
    "however the main reason for this is the different mass of core and neutron .",
    "the heavier the particle giving rise to a structure function , the narrower the structure function . since the @xmath2-particle is four times heavier than the neutron one has that @xmath20 is narrower than @xmath21 .",
    "more details of the spectral functions are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "they could be measured by coincidence experiments @xmath1he @xmath72 and @xmath1he@xmath73he in the low ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) region explored here .    to show that indeed we can get separately information of the @xmath2 and halo  neutron peaks , we show in fig.[fig3 ] how @xmath20 and @xmath21 enter in the inclusive differential cross section for incoming energies ( @xmath74 ) and scattering angles ( @xmath75 ) adequate to explore the low ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) domain discussed above . in this figure",
    "we show the inclusive @xmath1he(@xmath66 ) cross section for @xmath74=100 mev , and four different values of @xmath75 .",
    "there is a clean separation of longitudinal and transverse contributions as one goes from forward angles ( @xmath75=10@xmath76 , 60@xmath76 ) to backward angles ( @xmath75=120@xmath76 , 170@xmath76 ) .",
    "the results are plotted as a function of @xmath13 . for fixed @xmath74 and @xmath75 values",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 are linked by the relation @xmath77 . to guide the reader @xmath14values",
    "are indicated in the upper horizontal axes .",
    "similar plots are obtained if one varies the incoming energy in the range 70 mev @xmath78 150 mev . at forward angles",
    "only the @xmath2peak ( @xmath20 ) contributes , while as @xmath75 increases beyond 90@xmath76 the halo neutron contribution ( @xmath21 ) starts to increase till it becomes the dominant contribution to the differential cross section . at 180@xmath76",
    "there is no contribution from the longitudinal structure function and the only contribution remaining is the transverse one .",
    "this is a general property that is well known and prevails for electron scattering from any target ( see for instance ref.@xcite and references therein ) . not included in these figures is the contribution from elastic electron@xmath1he scattering , that was considered in @xcite and contributes only at forward angles and @xmath79 .",
    "we can see in fig.[fig3 ] that , in each plot , the peak of the differential cross section falls in an ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) range that is expected to be free from core breakup : @xmath80 200 mev / c and @xmath81@xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the nucleon mass and @xmath82@xmath6320 mev is the nucleon separation energy in the @xmath2particle .",
    "the latter process will be considered subsequently . in the calculations",
    "only the final interaction between particles @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is included . the important role that this interaction plays can be appreciated in fig.[fig3 ] by comparison to pwia results ( dotted line ) , where this interaction is switched off .",
    "the difference between both calculations is due to the structure that the two  body spectator resonances create in the spectral functions .",
    "it would be interesting to study the effect caused by the final state interaction between the knocked out particle and the spectators .",
    "the treatment of three  body interactions in the final state is highly non  trivial and deserves further work . in particular",
    "this requires knowledge of the three  body resonance states .",
    "experimental knowledge of three  body resonances is scant , but progress along these lines is being made @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have investigated inclusive electron scattering on two - neutron halo nuclei , and particularly on @xmath1he , to explore kinematical regions where the quasielastic processes @xmath1he@xmath84 and @xmath1he@xmath85 are favored .",
    "considering the halo nucleus as a three  body ( core+@xmath5+@xmath5 ) system , the differential cross section is calculated as the sum of terms coming from halo  neutron knockout and core knockout .",
    "it is then desirable to determine under what conditions the behavior of the different observables , cross section and structure functions , is dominated either by the halo neutrons or by the @xmath2core .    at forward scattering angles , for low @xmath14 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14@xmath86200 mev / c , @xmath13@xmath69@xmath87 )",
    "the behavior of the differential cross section and of the longitudinal structure function is dictated by the @xmath2knockout process . in this domain",
    "the cross sections are large and dominated by the @xmath2peak .",
    "it is therefore in this region where coincidence @xmath6 measurements should be performed to determine the spectral function @xmath88 that carries the information on the @xmath2momentum distribution in the halo nucleus , or equivalently on the dineutron residual system .",
    "furthermore , in the @xmath89 limit elastic scattering from @xmath1he will provide the most stringent test of the charge distribution in @xmath1he .",
    "if the present halo picture is correct the charge distribution in @xmath1he must be dictated by that in the @xmath2core .",
    "on the contrary , backward scattering is more favorable to measure the halo  neutron peak .",
    "in particular , @xmath90 , 50 @xmath78 100 mev and @xmath91 40 mev define a region where the inclusive cross section is sizeable and dominated by the halo neutron peak .",
    "thus coincidence @xmath7 measurements in this region will allow to determine the spectral function @xmath92 that carries the information on the halo neutron momentum distribution , or equivalently on the unbound @xmath93he residual system .",
