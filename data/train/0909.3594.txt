    "characterizing these different physical components of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) ( envelope , disk , outflow , cloud ) is thus crucial for understanding the physical evolution of the earliest stages of star formation : this is the phase in which the final mass of the star and disk are determined and the conditions for planet formation are set . because of the high extinction ( @xmath7 mag ) , these sources are best studied at ( sub)millimeter and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "most studies to date have focussed on the cold gas and dust around protostars , in particular using the dust continuum and low-@xmath0 lines of co and its isotopologues @xmath8co , c@xmath9o and/or c@xmath10o @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the warm gas is much more diagnostic of the energetic processes that shape these deeply embedded sources .",
    "the most direct probes of warm ( 50200 k ) gas are the high-@xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) lines of co ( for example , @xmath12  k for @xmath0=6 ) .",

    ". observations of high - excitation lines of co can be carried out from the ground in the atmospheric windows at 650 and 850 ghz , but they require excellent weather conditions .",
    "such pioneering data were obtained more than a decade ago at single positions with the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) using its excellent receiver suite @xcite and with the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) @xcite . around the same time , the _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) provided spectrally unresolved data on even higher-@xmath0 lines in a large @xmath14 beam ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the lack of spatial and/or spectral information on the warm gas prevented an in - depth analysis of these data , however .",

    "proposed options include ( i ) passive heating of the inner @xmath6100 au region of the collapsing envelope by the protostellar luminosity ; ( ii ) active heating in shocks created by the interaction of jets and winds from the protostar with the envelope and cloud out to large distances ; ( iii ) heating by uv photons escaping through outflow cavities and scattered back into the envelope on a few thousand au scales @xcite ; and ( iv ) a forming protoplanetary disk heated by accretion shocks @xcite . in scenarios ( i ) and",

    "the champ@xmath3 instrument , developed jointly by the mpifr and sron groningen , is the only submillimeter array receiver in the world able to simultaneously observe molecular line emission in the 650 and 850 ghz atmospheric windows on arcminute spatial scales with 79@xmath2 pixels @xcite .",
    "it is the successor of the champ array at 460 ghz deployed on the cso until 2003 .",
    "champ@xmath3 has 14 pixels ( 7 in each frequency window ) arranged in a hexagon of 6 pixels around 1 central pixel . to obtain fully sampled maps ,",
    "the array was either moved in a small hexagonal pattern , or , more efficiently , in an on - the - fly ( otf ) mode .",
    "the hexa - pattern covers a region of about 30@xmath17 , whereas small otf maps are 40@xmath18 , or occasionally larger .",
    "the observations were obtained during several observing runs between june 2007 and november 2008 in three different line settings , with the combination of lines chosen to match required integration times : ( 1 ) @xmath4co @xmath0=65 and 76 ; ( 2 ) @xmath8co 65 and [ c i ] 21 ; and ( 3 ) c@xmath9o 6 - 5 and @xmath8co 87 . for the latter",
    "setting ( so far done only for hh 46 ) , a stare mode was used to increase the @xmath19 on the central pixel . a position switch of 900@xmath2 or larger",
    "was used for all settings , except for the stare setting ( 3 ) , which used a beam - switching of 90@xmath2 .",

    "the backend consisted of two fast fourier transform spectrometer ( ffts ) units serving the central pixel ( resolution up to 0.12 mhz ) , and 12 mpi - auto - correlator spectrometer ( macs ) units ( resolution 1 mhz ) connected to the other pixels . since july 2008",

    "in addition to the line wings characterizing the swept - up outflow gas , surprisingly strong _ extended narrow _ co lines are seen along the direction of the outflow axis ( see for example spectra at @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "these data directly support scenario ( iii ) , in which uv radiation heats the surrounding outflow walls .    to test this scenario further ,",
    "the outflow region was mapped more extensively in @xmath4co 65 and [ c i ] 21 lines out to the tip of the outflow characterized by the bow shock around ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hh46-spitzer ] shows an overlay of the co and [ c i ] integrated intensity maps on the _ spitzer _ image . the co emission ( both narrow and broad ) clearly disappears toward the location of the bow shock .",
    "although the dynamic range of the [ c i ] map is not large , narrow [ c i ] 21 line emission is somewhat enhanced around the bow shock position .",
    "this suggests that along most of the outflow axis the uv photons are energetic enough ( @xmath35few ev ) to heat the gas , but not to photodissociate co. in contrast , at the bow - shock position , photons must be present with high enough energies to dissociate co ( @xmath3511 ev , @xmath361100  ) and produce [ c i ] emission both ahead and just behind the shock .",
    "according to the models by @xcite , @xmath37shocks with velocities larger than 90 km s@xmath21 produce co dissociating photons , mostly through the two - photon decay of metastable he(2 @xmath38s ) atoms . at the bow shock , the shock velocity is measured to be 220 km s@xmath21 from atomic lines @xcite , more than sufficient to produce these high energy photons .",
    "because of the high densities in the core , they can travel only a short path before being absorbed by dust , h@xmath5 or co. this situation is reminescent of the ic 443 supernova remnant , where quiescent [ c i ] emission was also detected ahead of the shock and interpreted to arise from photodissociation of co in the pre - shocked gas @xcite .",
    "the champ@xmath3 data thus provide support for scenario ( iii ) , but with an extension of the original model by @xcite .",
    "first , the uv photons originate not only from the source itself but are also produced further out by the bow- and jet - shocks .",
    "second , @xcite suggested that the uv photons from the star - disk accretion boundary layer reach large distances by scattering on dust grains in the outflow cone . @xcite and @xcite note that direct illumination of the outflow walls may be more effective if the outflow walls have a parabolic rather than a linear straight shape ( see figure  [ fig : hh46-cartoon ] for illustration ) .",
    "60,000 au from the source , illustrating the photon heating of the cavity walls ( either directly or scattered by dust ) responsible for the bulk of the quiescent high-@xmath0 co emission .",
    "uv photons are created at the star - disk accretion boundary layer as well as in the bow- and jet shocks .",
    "the inserts illustrate possible geometries at the base of the outflow , with the parabolic shape allowing more direct illumination of the outflow walls ( reproduced with permission from van kempen et al .",
    "2009a ) . ]",
    "to quantify the contribution to the emission at the source position from scenario ( i ) , a passively heated envelope model has been constructed following the method of @xcite .",
    "the envelope is assumed to have a power - law density structure , with the temperature determined by a dust radiative transfer calculation with the luminosity of the source as input .",
    "the power - law exponent , mass and extent of the envelope are determined by a best fit to the spectral energy distribution and dust continuum maps .",
    "for hh 46 , a laboca 850 @xmath22 m map over the central @xmath39 map has been obtained for this purpose .",
    "subsequently , the co excitation and line emission are calculated for the resulting best - fit temperature and density envelope structure using the monte carlo radiative transfer package of @xcite , assuming that the gas temperature equals the dust temperature .",
    "the latter assumption should hold for the inner envelope where densities are high enough ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ) for gas and dust to be thermally coupled .",
    "this quantitative analysis shows that the envelope emission can reproduce some of the observed high-@xmath0 co emission shown figure  [ fig : hh46-spec ] ( left ) , but generally underproduces the @xmath4co and @xmath8co 65 lines by nearly a factor of 3 .",
    "increasing the co abundance is not possible since then the c@xmath9o 32 and 65 lines would be overproduced .",
    "thus , an additional optically thin but warm component needs to be added to the model to explain the data .",
    "it needs to be relatively unobscured since it adds emission to that of the optically thick @xmath4co lines from the inner envelope .",
    "photon - heated gas in the ( outer ) envelope fulfills these criteria .",
    "the weak observed [ c i ] emission at the source position can be accounted for by a low atomic c abundance ( @xmath6few @xmath42 with respect to hydrogen ) that is maintained by cosmic ray induced uv photodissocation of co inside the dense envelope .",
    "the current data do not provide constraints on scenario ( iv ) , i.e. , whether some of the hot gas could be due to the accretion shock onto the disk in the embedded phase . to answer this question , submillimeter interferometry in the co @xmath0=65 and 76 lines with alma",
    "is needed .",
    "high spatial and spectral resolution mid - infrared co @xmath43=10 data at 4.6 @xmath22 m can also provide insight into this question .    in summary , the quantitative analysis by @xcite shows that the warm gas traced by the high-@xmath0 co arises from three different components : ( i ) the quiescent inner warm envelope , accounting for roughly 30% of the @xmath4co and @xmath8co on - source intensities ; ( ii ) the outflowing gas , accounting for the extended red and blue wings ; and ( iii ) _ uv - heated quiescent gas ( @xmath44 k ) , accounting ( surprisingly ! ) for the bulk of the extended narrow 65 and 76 emission .",
    "data for several of the other sources in table  [ tab : sources ] are presented in @xcite and confirm the results found for hh 46 .",
    "warm gas , as traced by @xmath4co 65 and 76 , is present in all observed protostars at the central position . for ced 110",
    "irs 4 , a quantitative model similar to that for hh 46 shows that passive heating of the envelope is again insufficient to explain the observed @xmath4co 65 , 76 and @xmath8co 65 lines , requiring heating of the envelope by uv photons even at the ( 0,0 ) position .",
    "mapping shows that photon heating of the cavity walls takes place on arcmin scales for the outflows of several other class 0 and class i protostars , as seen at positions off - source of bhr 71 , ngc 1333 irs2 , and l  1551 irs5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ngc1333-map ] shows a preliminary map of the ngc 1333 iras4a / b region , with both outflow and narrow emission present along the outflow axis of the iras4a flow ( yildiz et al . , in prep . ) . as for hh 46 , the necessary uv photons",
    "are likely created by internal jet shocks and the bow shock where the jet interacts with the ambient medium , in addition to the disk - star accretion boundary layer .",
    "the distribution of the quiescent co 65 and 76 emission seen toward bhr  71 , where the narrow emission is stronger at larger distances from the source , confirms the hypothesis that uv photons necessary for heating can originate from both mechanisms .",
    "although difficult to disentangle in cases where the outflow is not in the plane of the sky , the observations suggest that photon heating is a common phenomena along all outflows .",
    "the lack of [ c i ] 21 emission in the outflows indicates that there is limited production of energetic co dissociating photons in the shocks",
    ".    shocked broad @xmath4co 65 and 76 lines are only seen prominently in the flows of more massive sources ( ngc 1333 iras2 and iras4a / b , bhr 71 , hh  46 , rcra irs7 and the serpens sources ) , while lower mass flows do not show significant @xmath4co 65 and 76 line wings .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that the outflows of class i sources are more evolved and are driven with much less energy , producing significantly weaker shocks and less swept - up gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is also reflected in the decreasing maximum velocity of @xmath4co 65 with lower outflow force . from the co 65/32 line ratios , kinetic temperatures of @xmath6100 k",
    "are found for the molecular gas in the flows studied here .",
    "such temperatures agree with expected conditions of bow - shock driven shell models by @xcite , in which the momentum - conserving shells expand and loose kinetic energy to heat the swept - up molecular gas .",
    "only the flows of l  1551 irs5 and iras 12496 - 7650 appear to be colder ( @xmath3650 k ) , consistent with the ` fossil ' , empty nature of these flows .",
    "the intensities at all positions toward rcra irs7 are an order of magnitude higher than can be produced by passive heating , and probably result from a significant pdr region near the source .",
    "likely , rcra itself heats the outside of the rcra irs7 envelope and cloud region .",
    "maps in high-@xmath0 co submillimeter lines clearly provide crucial information to determine the location and origin of warm dense gas near ysos and the feedback that the young star has on its surroundings .",
    "questions to be addressed with future larger samples combined with _",
    "herschel _ data include : is the uv - heated , quiescent component always dominant , or does this change from the deeply embedded class 0 phase to the less embedded class 1 phase and eventually the disk - dominated phase ? does this heating limit the ability of the cloud to collapse further and thus help determine the final mass of the star ? how hot is the outflowing molecular gas and how does this depend on evolutionary state ?    the processes identified here have strong implications not only for the physical evolution , but also for the chemistry near protostars , especially the origin of the emission from water and complex organic molecules .",
    "for example , if uv radiation is indeed widespread around low - mass ysos , it will readily dissociate h@xmath5o into oh and h , strongly affecting the predictions and interpretation of upcoming _ herschel - hifi _ data .",
    "some indications of this process have already been found through enhanced narrow cn emission ( a photoproduct of hcn ) along the outflow axis of the low - mass yso l483 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the uv photons can photoprocess and photodesorb ices such as ch@xmath13oh efficiently and thus enhance their gas phase abundances ( berg et al .  2009a , b ) .",
    "recent mapping of the champ@xmath3 sources in hcn , cn and ch@xmath13oh with the jcmt - harp and iram 30-m hera arrays is in progress to test these chemical consequences ( kristensen et al .",
    ", in prep ) .    together",
    ", the quality and richness of these data sets are a tribute to the instrument builders and illustrate how far and rapidly the field has developed since the first pioneering 230 ghz data by @xcite .",
