    "the problem of initial singularity still remains at the center of modern day cosmology .",
    "though big bang theory is deep rooted among the scientists dealing with early day cosmology , it is natural to look back if one can model a universe free from initial singularity .",
    "the nonlinear generalization of classical field theory remains one of the possible ways to over come the difficulties of the theory which considers elementary particles as mathematical points .",
    "the gravitational field equation is nonlinear by nature and the field itself is universal and unscreenable .",
    "these properties lead to definite physical interest for the proper gravitational field to be considered .",
    "frw models are widely considered as good approximation of the present and early stages of the universe .",
    "but the large scale matter distribution in the observable universe , largely manifested in the form of discrete structures , does not exhibit homogeneity of a higher order .",
    "recent space investigations detect anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "the theoretical arguments  @xcite and recent experimental datas that support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one leads to consider the models of universe with anisotropic back - ground .",
    "zeldovich was first to assume that the early isotropization of cosmological expanding process can take place as a result of quantum effect of particle creation near singularity  @xcite .",
    "this assumption was further justified by several authors  @xcite .    a bianchi type - i ( bi ) universe ,",
    "being the straightforward generalization of the flat freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogenous and spatially flat universe . unlike the frw universe which has the same scale factor for each of the three spatial directions , a bi universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "it moreover has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , even in the presence of matter , and consequently falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al  @xcite .",
    "also in a universe filled with matter for @xmath1 , it has been shown that any initial anisotropy in a bi universe quickly dies away and a bi universe eventually evolves into a frw universe  @xcite .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , this feature of the bi universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations .    nonlinear spinor field ( nlsf ) in external frw cosmological gravitational field was first studied by shikin @xcite .",
    "here we would like to note that the presence of a singular point to time in its space - time metric is another important property of the isotropic model .",
    "the presence such a singular point means that the time is restricted .",
    "the motivation for introduction a nonlinear term in the spinor field lagrangian was to answer the natural question that arises in connection with the presence of singular point , i.e. , to what extent the presence of a singular point is an inherent property of the relativistic cosmological models or whether it is only a consequence of specific simplifying assumptions underlying these models .",
    "the study by shikin  @xcite shows that the presence of spinor filed nonlinearity is not enough to remove singularity in a frw space - time .",
    "the natural choice was to introduce anisotropy in the model and analyze the nonlinear spinor field equations in an external bi universe that was carried out in  @xcite recently , we study  @xcite the role of the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) in the lagrangian which together with newton s gravitational constant ( @xmath2 ) is considered as the fundamental constants in einstein s theory of gravity .",
