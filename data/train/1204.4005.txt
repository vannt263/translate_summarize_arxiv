    "in the recent years , the meaning of quantum discords has been attracted a lot of interest because it indicates that entangled states are not the only kind of quantum states exhibiting nonclassical features@xcite .",
    "quantum discord is a measure of the discrepancy between two natural yet different quantum analogs of the classical mutual information .",
    "quantum discord captures the fundamental feature of the quantumness of nonclassical correlations , which is much like quantum entanglement , but it is beyond quantum entanglement because quantum discord is even present in separable quantum states .",
    "quantum discords have strong potentials in studying dynamical processes@xcite , some quantum information processes such as the broadcasting of quantum states@xcite quantum state merging @xcite , quantum entanglement distillation@xcite , entanglement of formation @xcite .",
    "+ besides , there has been considerable interest in the quantum information properties of solid state environment particularly , semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) due to their well defined controllable atom - like and molecule - like properties@xcite . to study the electro - optical properties of qds ( specially coupled ones ) ,",
    "one of the most interesting parameter is the exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "this kind of interaction in first neighbors dots will allow to implement a scheme for quantum information processing on qds @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the biexcitonic shift due to the dipolar interaction allows for subpicosecond quantum gate operations@xcite .",
    "it was proven that the optically driven qds , that are carrying excitons are good candidates for implementation of quantum gates and quantum computation@xcite .    in order to study the amount of concurrence and discord in the array of excitons inside qds , we employ the lower bound of concurrence for thermal density matrix of identical and",
    "equidistant coupled qds at different bath temperatures .",
    "furthermore , by the means of electric field , the manipulation of entanglement and discord will be discussed .",
    "we show that , quantum correlations may be enhanced upon increasing the temperature and decreased with incresing the electric field across the system .",
    "our theoretical model detects nonvanishing quantum discord , ensuring the existence of nonclassical correlations as measured by the quantum discord",
    "the model sample to study the quantum correlation properties of optically driven qds is a series of inas coupled qds with small equal spacing between them along the axis .",
    "this model can be realized experimentally(see for example reference@xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "frster mechanism@xcite is a valid model to explain the energy transfer between qds through dipolar interaction between the excitons . here , the qubits are the excitonic electric dipole moments located in each qd which can only orient along ( @xmath0 ) or against ( @xmath1 ) the external electric fields .",
    "for such a system , tuning and controlling the quantum correlation between the dipoles is of great importance .",
    "the governing hamiltonian of dipoles in the presence of external electric field simply reads :    @xmath2+\\nonumber\\\\ + \\hbar\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\omega_i\\hat{s_i^z}+\\hbar\\sum_{i=1}^{n}j_z[s_+^i][s_-^j]+\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j=1}^{n}\\lambda[s_+^is_-^j+s_-^js_+^i],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath3=@xmath4,@xmath5=@xmath6 , and @xmath7=@xmath8 .",

    "we assume that the dipole carried by exciton is the one order of magnitude in debyes , a typical experimental electric field @xmath18 @xmath19 , so the dipolar interaction parameter(@xmath20 ) will be of the order of @xmath21 .",
    "frster interaction energy(@xmath22 ) and @xmath23 are assumed to be in the order of @xmath21 .",
    "this values are consistent with experimental observations and calculations@xcite .",
    "since entanglement is conceived as a resource to perform various tasks of quantum information processing @xcite , knowledge about the amount of entanglement in a quantum state is so important . indeed ,",
    "awareness from the value of entanglement , means knowing how well a certain task can be accomplished .",
    "the quantification problem of entanglement only for bipartite systems in pure states @xcite and two - qubit system in mixed state @xcite is essentially solved . in multi - partite systems ,",
    "even the pure state case , this problem is not exactly solved and just lower bounds for the entanglement have been proposed @xcite . here , in order to determination the exact minimum of entanglement between three dipoles(excitons ) , we use the lower bound of concurrence for three - qubit state which is recently suggested by li et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is terms of the bipartite concurrences for qubits @xmath26 and @xmath27 which is given by @xmath28 in this notation , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , are the square nonzero roots , in decreasing order , of the non - hermitian matrix @xmath31 .",

    "in what follows , we theoretically test for the existence of quantum discord in aforementioned system containing excitonic qbits and that how it behaves with external electric field . from figures 1 , comparing the concurrence and the discord measures at different temperatures shows that , quantum discord survives at relatively high temperatures where concurrence is zero , also figures depict at very low temperatures both measures yield the same result . at higher temperatures ,",
    "concurrence suddenly diminishes while quantum discord is still finite , slowly decreasing to zero .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that discord quantifies nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement . generally , both quantum correlations decay with temperature due to thermal relaxation effects .",
    "figures demonstrate that when electrical bias is off the quantum correlations increase monotonically with increasing frster interaction .",
    "this can be explained in terms of the increasing excitonic interaction that leads to increase the correlations . at",
    "frster interactions higher than about @xmath92 and at temperatures smaller than @xmath93 , concurrence is slightly larger than discord .",
    "in contrast , at lower frster interactions the opposite trend is observed and discord overcomes the concurrence almost for all temperatures that is because of as mentioned fact that discord indicates nonclassical correlations beyond entanglement even when @xmath13 is low . from figures",
    "it is clear that at lower @xmath13 , temperature helps to make the correlations so that for very low temperatures , till about @xmath93(for discord ) and @xmath94(for concurrence ) , discord and concurrence increase with increasing temperature due to the thermal entanglement effects@xcite .",
    "+ figures 2 displays discord and correlation measures when @xmath95 is assumed to be 2.5 @xmath21 that corresponds to the electric field(@xmath96 ) of about @xmath97 @xmath19 ( this small value for electric field can be realized by experiments very easily ) .",
    "it is clear that discord and concurrence are smaller than that of observed in figure1 .",
    "this indicates that turning electric field on , decreases the correlations .",
    "it is because electric field makes all the dipoles align in the same direction that results in increasing dipolar repulsive interaction that immediately leads to the reduction of coulomb induced correlations@xcite .",
    "for all the values of @xmath13 the discord is survived with increasing @xmath96 while the concurrence dies for smaller @xmath13 .",
    "our results shows that increasing the electric field overcomes the effect of frster interaction and removes the concurrence for all values of @xmath13 , however , nonzero discord can still be observed for higher values of electric field(figure3 ) .",
    "this manifests the importance of discord to measure the quantum correlations .",
    "@xmath19 . ]",
    "in summary , we studied the quantum discord and concurrence measures in the array of optically driven coupled quantum dots .",
    "qubits are excitons in each quantum dot that can be model by dipoles .",
    "we used the lower bound of concurrence for thermal density matrix of identical and equidistant coupled qds at different temperatures .",
    "we found that the discord and concurrence are enhanced by increasing the parameter of frster interaction that is resulted by increasing correlations with increasing this parameter .",
    "for very low temperatures and higher frster interaction , concurrence is slightly larger than discord . in stark contrast , at low frster interactions the opposite trend is observed .",
    "also in very low temperature region , because of thermal entanglement , both measures increase and then tend to zero for higher temperatures induced by thermal relaxation effects .",
    "we observed that switching electric field on , correlations diminish , however , discord is survived while concurrence dies for the all values of frster interaction .",
    "it is because electric field makes all the dipoles to be parallel that results in increasing dipolar repulsive interaction and finally decrease the entanglement .",
