    "type-1.5 _ superconductivity has been coined@xcite to emphasize the possibility of a state that is intermediate between the two regimes .",
    "specifically , one considers two - component or two - band systems with order parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 that have qualitatively different spatial dependence , with different respective coherence lengths @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the existence of these two length scales emerges from the assumption that one can neglect the josephson type coupling between two order parameters .",
    "the regime where one expects novel behavior is obviously the limit @xmath18 .",
    "then one order parameter component might behave as a type - i superconductor while the other follows the type - ii behavior .",
    "consequences of such behavior were discussed in ref . where it was concluded that properties emerge that fall outside the usual type - i / type - ii dichotomy .",
    "for example , the emergence of `` vortex molecules '' and of an inhomogeneous state comprising a mixture of domains of a two - component meissner state and vortex clusters were proposed .  in ref .",
    "the surface energy for such a system was analyzed with the conclusion that @xmath5 must be replaced by a function that depends on several dimensionless quantities , in particular on the ratio @xmath19 . changing @xmath19 at fixed penetration depth was shown to yield a sign change of @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , even in multiband superconductors , the sign of the surface energy is either positive or negative . thus , it seems more appropriate to discuss the physics that was investigated in ref . within the gl",
    "approach,@xcite as interesting modifications of type - ii superconductivity .",
    "more importantly , it is crucial to analyze what exactly happens in a multiband superconductor in the vicinity of the transition temperature , with @xmath20 in the regime where the gl approach is valid ( ignoring , as usual , critical fluctuations ) .",
    "one of the key features of the two - band gl model is the josephson like coupling between the two bands , @xmath21 in the expansion of the gl free energy density .",
    "refs . and analyze the limit @xmath22 , but assume that both order parameters , while uncoupled , order at the same temperature .",
    "the more realistic regime is clearly the one where the common transition temperature is the consequence of a finite order parameter coupling @xmath23 .    in this paper",
    "we determine the surface energy @xmath0 of a two - band gl model including the coupling , eq.([fc ] ) , between the bands , i.e. we consider @xmath24 .",
    "we find that in the regime @xmath25 , where the gl theory provides the correct mean field description , eq.([sigmas ] ) continues to be the correct expression for the interface energy with same function @xmath5 , * *  * * which implies that the surface energy continues to change sign * *  * * at @xmath9 .",
    "the multi - component nature of the order parameter enters the gl @xmath8 through the values of @xmath4 and@xmath26 a detailed definition of @xmath4 and @xmath27 in the two - band problem is presented * *  * * below .",
    "we also find that * * , * * while the order parameters may have different amplitudes in the homogeneous bulk , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , close to the transition temperature , i.e. for small @xmath30 , they have the same spatial dependence near the interface .",

    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 vary in space on the single length scale @xmath32 of eq.([xi ] ) .",
    "close to a superconducting transition it is then sufficient to introduce only one order parameter to characterize the symmetry broken state .",
    "an exception is the case where two completely uncoupled order parameters are accidentally degenerate , i.e. both components accidentally have the exact same transition temperatures @xmath1 , while they have , at the same time , different coherence lengths .",
    "this is the scenario considered in refs . and .",
    "we stress , that our results do not preclude novel type - ii behavior that may occur deeper in the ordered state away of the gl domain .",
    "this is however beyond the limit of applicability of the gl theory . in the next section we present our analysis .",
    "we summarize our findings in section 3 .",
    "we start with the free energy , @xmath33 of a two - band superconductor .",
    "@xmath34 is a functional of the pairing wave functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the two components or bands and of the vector potential @xmath37 associated with the magnetic field @xmath38 .",
    "the free energy density , @xmath39 , relative to the zero field normal state value , is : @xmath40 here the @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , are the gl expansions of the two bands : @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the coupling term given in eq.([fc ] ) . here * @xmath45 * and the bands effective masses are @xmath46 .",
    "the physical values of the order parameter and vector potential are determined via @xmath47 . in principle",
    "additional coupling terms such as @xmath48 , @xmath49 , etc . are allowed . for clean multiband systems , a weak coupling expansion yields that  the coefficients of such terms vanish due to momentum conservation@xcite .",
    "in addition , even if present , such terms are sub - leading close to the transition temperature point when compared to @xmath50 of eq.([fc ] ) .",
    "we first discuss the homogeneous , zero field solution . ignoring the inter - band coupling , @xmath51 ,",
    "one finds , as usual , @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 . in the general case of @xmath56",
    ", however , the common critical temperature @xmath1 is not equal to either of @xmath57 and there is no reason that both coefficients @xmath58 change sign at the same temperature . at @xmath1 the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix of the homogeneous quadratic terms in @xmath39 vanishes . in our problem , this eigenvalue is @xmath59 it vanishes for @xmath60 .",
    "thus , it must hold that @xmath61 , as @xmath62 would be negative if one of the two @xmath63 is smaller or equal to zero .",

    "to proceed , we introduce the dimensionless ratio @xmath64 that vanishes at @xmath1 ( see also the appendix ) .",
    "it is convenient to eliminate @xmath65 in favor of @xmath66 .",
    "thus , small @xmath66 naturally corresponds to finite interband coupling @xmath23 . for small @xmath66 we have @xmath67 and the smallest eigenvalue changes sign at @xmath68 .",
    "the free energy minimization of the homogeneous problem for @xmath24 leads to the system @xmath69 which is readily reduced to a fourth order equation for @xmath70 that can be solved using known formulas for the roots of a quartic equation .",
    "one can simplify the problem by recognizing that the gl theory is only valid in the vicinity of the transition temperature , @xmath71 .",
    "the homogeneous order parameters can easily be determined to leading order in @xmath66 : @xmath72 where the subscript @xmath73 is to denote the zero - field solution .",
    "hence , the temperature dependence of the order parameters is as expected : @xmath74 we stress that within gl theory there is no reason to go to terms of higher orders in @xmath66",

    "we obtain @xmath80 it is now straightforward to set up the formalism to determine the interface energy .",
    "in evaluating the surface energy we follow closely the classical approach that was used for the single band problem . @xcite",
    "consider the interface between superconducting and normal half - spaces at the plane @xmath81 .",
    "the field @xmath82 is applied along the @xmath83 axis parrallel to the interface and equal to @xmath2 to ensure coexistence of two phases .",
    "then the magnetic induction has only one component @xmath84 and the vector potential can be chosen as @xmath85 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , yielding @xmath86        we can choose real order parameters that vary along the @xmath87-direction . the gibbs free energy per unit area that is minimum in a given applied field reads:@xmath88 far away from the interface we have on one side the normal state with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , while on the other side for @xmath91 we have the homogeneous superconducting state with @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless quantities : @xmath94 which imply that the dimensionless vector potential @xmath95 .",
    "the surface energy is then given by @xmath96,\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a functional that must be minimized with respect to the @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 to yield @xmath0 .",
    "after simple algebra we obtain : @xmath101 where @xmath102 we use here the following notations : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , as given in eq.([opstat1 ] ) , and @xmath106 minimization of @xmath97 gives a system of coupled differential equations for @xmath107 : @xmath108    @xmath109    multiplying eq.([eqofmot1 ] ) by @xmath110 , eq.([eqofmot2 ] ) by @xmath111 and summing , the first integral of this system is obtained : @xmath112    the peculiar term in our analysis is the first one in @xmath113 of eq.([v ] ) that seems to be singular as @xmath114 .",
    "expanding for small @xmath66 , we have:@xmath115 thus , close to the transition temperature we must have @xmath116 . introducing @xmath117 , which is equivalent to eq.([ops ] ) ,",
    "one obtains the surface energy functional in the form : @xmath118 with @xmath119 and effective parameter @xmath8 given by@xmath120 this is an exact form of the functional for the standard one - band surface enrgy problem.@xcite    it is worth noting that @xmath121 enter the surface energy only through the combination @xmath8 of eq.([kappatpt ] ) .",
    "in particular , this leads to eq.([xi ] ) for the correlation length of the two band problem with @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the interface problem is identical to the one of a single band system , leading to eq.([sigmas ] ) with the same function @xmath5 .",

    "we discretized the interval @xmath123 $ ] to @xmath124 equidistant steps ( @xmath125 ) and minimized @xmath97 with respect to @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 subject to boundary conditions @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 and @xmath132 . the homogeneous bulk solutions @xmath133 approach the value @xmath134 for @xmath114",
    "finally , since in the limit @xmath135 the interface position is arbitrary , at @xmath136 we assumed @xmath137 , which centers the interface position in the large @xmath8 limit .",

    "4 , as well as fig . 5 and fig . 6",

    "3 and 4 we focus on the most nontrivial limit with @xmath139 .",
    "naively , one could expect @xmath98 to change on distances of the order @xmath140 ( type - i behavior ) , while @xmath141 suggests type - ii behavior of @xmath99 .",
    "contrary to this expectation we find that both order parameters are strongly coupled by the josephson energy and have increasingly similar spatial variation as @xmath114 . as we will see below ,",
    "the interface energy for this set of parameters is positive and the system behaves as a type - i superconductor as @xmath8 in eq.([kappatpt ] ) is dominated by the smallest of the two @xmath121 .    in figs .",
    "5 and 6 we show the behavior for @xmath142 and @xmath143 , corresponding indeed to a type - ii superconductor with negative interface energy ( see below for explicit values ) . again",
    ", both order parameters follow the same spatial dependence and behave according to eq.([ops ] ) as @xmath66 decreases .",
    "in addition , as @xmath66 decreases , the value of the minimized functional of eq.([sigma functional ] ) approaches the value of the function @xmath5 of the single band problem with @xmath8 determined by eq.([kappatpt ] ) .",
    "this can explicitly be seen in the numerical results of @xmath144 and @xmath5 corresponding to figs .",

    "in summary , for a two - band superconductor we analyzed the energy of the interface between regions of a finite order parameter and zero order parameters , coexisting at the thermodynamic critical field @xmath2 .",
    "if one includes the interband josephson coupling between the bands , i.e. the leading allowed interaction between the cooper - pair wave function @xmath35 and @xmath36 , both order parameters vary close to the transition temperature on identical length scales .",
    "thus , despite the fact that both order parameters may have very different amplitudes , they vary on the same characteristic length scale @xmath163 , where the @xmath164 are the typical length scales where the gradient ( or kinetic ) energies in the gl functional become comparable to the bulk condensation energy .",
    "we stress that @xmath165 are just auxiliary quantities and only @xmath32 is a measurable physical length .",
    "an important implication of this result is that the surface energy is determined by a single gl parameter @xmath6 in a way identical to the single band case .",
    "thus , there is no room left for so - called _ type-1.5 _ superconductivity in the gl regime close to @xmath1 .",
