    "there is increasing evidence that halos of normal spiral galaxies contain a complex multiphase interstellar medium ( ism ) ( for a review see , e.g. , dahlem @xcite ) . besides a hot component as observed by x - ray emission ( @xmath710@xmath8k ) or uv absorption ( @xmath90.5@xmath1010@xmath11k ) , diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) constitutes another important phase of typically 10@xmath12k ( dettmar @xcite ) .",
    "this component is easily observed by its @xmath13 region like line emission and is found to be widespread in galaxies with actively star forming disks ( rand @xcite , dettmar @xcite , rossa & dettmar @xcite ) .    in the last couple of years",
    "two important problems have been discussed with regard to the physics of this interstellar gas phase .",
    "the observed line ratios are not explained in a straight forward way by pure photoionization models and require additional heating mechansims of the halo gas ( e.g. , golla et al .",
    "@xcite , rand @xcite , tllmann&dettmar @xcite ) while first kinematic observations hint at a slower rotation of halo gas if compared to the underlying disk ( rand @xcite ) . both kinds of observations could help to constrain models of the origin of halo gas which in turn are important for the understanding of galaxy evolution since large scale mass flows are of influence for star formation and chemical evolution .    only for a few objects , such as ngc891 ( dahlem et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ngc4631 ( golla&hummel @xcite ) , and ngc5775 , the various components of the halo ism are observed with sufficient sensitivity and resolution to study possible physical processes at their interfaces such as turbulent mixing or thermal conduction . for such processes",
    "yet another ism component can be of importance , namely the non - thermal component consisting of magnetic fields and cosmic rays as observed by its radio - continuum radiation .",
    "any large scale gas motion and in particular its @xmath14-component will also be of importance for dynamo theories which try to explain the large scale distribution of magnetic fields in galaxies .",
    "however , various approaches to describe galactic dynamos are still very controversial and more detailed information on galactic gas flows in halos as well as magnetic field structures could help constraining such models .",
    "for all these questions , the case of the sc edge - on galaxy ngc5775 has received some attention recently , since marked radio - continuum ( duric et al .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath15 ( irwin @xcite ) halo components are accompanied by a very extended dig halo ( dettmar @xcite , collins et al .",
    "@xcite ) for which a strong decline of the rotational velocity with height above the plane ( @xmath14 ) has been found ( rand @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we report on first spectroscopic results for the dig halo of ngc5775 with the vlt , confirming the strong @xmath14-dependence of the halo rotation presented by rand ( @xcite ) , along with a first detailed determination of the magnetic field structure in the halo from vla radio - continuum observations .",
    "spectroscopic observations were carried out with fors1 at vlt / ut1 in longslit mode on 1999 june 14 - 15 at a median seeing of @xmath16 .",
    "a tek@xmath17 ccd with a pixel size of @xmath18 and a spatial resolution of @xmath19 pix@xmath20 was used for the measurements .",
    "grism gris_600b+12 was chosen for the blue and gris_600r+14 for the red spectral region , yielding a wavelength coverage of 35005900  and 52507400 , respectively .",
    "the slit length of fors1 is @xmath21 and the selected slit width of @xmath22 gives an average resolution of 5.9for the red and 6.2  for the blue grism , respectively .",
    "our slit covers large filamentary structures of h@xmath6 emission in the ne and sw halo ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . for each grism the total integration time amounted to 3 hours , reaching a noise level of @xmath23ergs @xmath24s@xmath20@xmath20pix@xmath20 .",
    "data reduction was performed in the usual manner using standard iraf software while the analysis was done within the midas environment .",
    "maps of total power and the linearly polarized radio - continuum emission of ngc5775 at 1.49ghz and 4.86ghz have been obtained from archive data of the very large array ( vla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "all data were recorded during 1989  1994 .",
    "the total observation time used on source was about 10  hours at 4.86ghz ( d - array ) , 14hours at 1.49ghz with c - array , and 2.5hours with d - array .",
    "data reduction has been performed with the aips software package following standard procedures .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise obtained in the final maps is 16@xmath25jy / b.a . and 100@xmath25jy / b.a . in total power , and 7@xmath25jy / b.a . and 25@xmath25jy / b.a . in polarized intensity at 4.86ghz and 1.49ghz , respectively",
    "several strong emission lines such as @xmath26\\lambda$]6583 or @xmath27\\lambda$]3727 can be traced out to 66  or 9kpc ( assuming a distance of d = 26.7mpc ) above the disk in both directions , much further than any previous imaging result .",
    "similar findings have been reported by rand @xcite for the western part of ngc5775 .",
    "all measured line ratios are presented in fig .",
    "some ratios , such as [ ] and [ ] , are lower in the sw section , most likely due to a more patchy structure of the filament . with an inclination of @xmath28 ,",
    "ngc5775 is close to edge - on and inclination effects are considered to be negligible . in order to clarify the issue of possible ionization mechanisms of the dig we compare our observational results with predictions of pure photoionization models from mathis ( @xcite , ma86 hereafter ) and domgrgen&mathis ( @xcite , dm94 hereafter ) .",
    "if we adopt photoionization by ob stars as the only ionization source and that radiation gets more and more dilute as it extends towards the halo , these models should reproduce observational data , such as the rising [ ] /h@xmath6 , non - linear changes in [ ] / [ ] , or extreme ratios of [ ] /h@xmath6 and /h@xmath6 .    [ ] /h@xmath6 is fitted only for the disk by the model of ma86 assuming a very soft radiation field ( @xmath29 ) and o7 stars with effective temperatures of 35000k as ionizing sources , whereas the dm94 model fails completely . by no means",
    "dm94 can reproduce halo ratios for [ ] /h@xmath6 larger than 0.66 , while ma86 gives correct values ranging from 0.26 for the disk to 0.88 for the halo .",
    "since these models predict an increase of [ ] / [ ] towards the halo , most likely a consequence of slightly different ionization potentials of s@xmath30 and n@xmath30 , they are unable to explain the non - linear trend visible in fig .",
    "another important ratio is /h@xmath6 which could be measured only close to the disk - halo interface of ngc5775 ( @xmath311.1kpc@xmath321.65kpc ) , making this detection nevertheless unique concerning its @xmath14 extent .",
    "however , both models underestimate this ratio by a factor of two .",
    "the most striking feature in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] is the rise of [ ] /h@xmath6 with increasing @xmath14 which is not explained by pure photoionization codes .",
    "generally this ratio declines from values of about 2 in the disk to 0.8 in the halo .",
    "both models also fail to predict [ ] /h@xmath6 .",
    "the lowest predicted values vary around 1 , whereas the observed data never exceed this limit .",
    "[ ] /h@xmath6 reveals with 0.33 for the sw and 0.48 for the ne halo by far the highest values ever measured for the dig .",
    "ma86 and dm94 are able to fit ratios only up to 0.1",
    ".    the extreme line ratios of /h@xmath6 ( @xmath70.05 ) and",
    "[ ] /h@xmath6 ( @xmath70.3 ) , the shapes of [ ] /h@xmath6 and [ ] / [ ] together with an unprecedented dig extent of 9kpc ( see also rand @xcite ) make this galaxy the most outstanding and challenging testbench for future ionization models .    since common photoionization models are unable to reproduce the data for halo dig in external galaxies as well as the reynolds - layer of the milky way , recent studies ( e.g. , rand @xcite , reynolds et al .",
    "@xcite , tllmann & dettmar @xcite ) have pointed out the need to involve additional ionization and/or heating mechanisms such as shocks , photoelectric heating by dust , or magnetic reconnection .",
    "these mechanisms should increase the electron temperature without affecting the ionization stage of an atom and dominate in the halo over collisional ionization .",
    "following haffner et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and collins&rand ( @xcite , cr hereafter ) we used the @xmath26\\lambda$]6583 emission line to determine a temperature profile ( shown in the upper right diagram of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) which varies between 6500 and 9200k .",
    "this profile can be used to derive theoretical line ratios ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] ) for oxygen and sulfur . in order to fit the observed ratios , the ionization fraction as the only free parameter",
    "is changed accordingly .",
    "for consistency we also derived electron temperatures for the eastern part of ngc5775 which are based on upper limits of the @xmath26\\lambda$]5755 emission line ( osterbrock , @xcite ) .",
    "they have been estimated to be 7350k in the disk ( at 0.5kpc ) , 7750k for the ne filament , and 7900k for the sw filament ( both measured at 5.0kpc ) , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with our temperature determinations mentioned above and also with profiles obtained by cr for the central and western part of this galaxy .",
    "furthermore , plots on the right of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] reveal prominent gradients which decrease as the ionization stage of oxygen increases .",
    "a likely physical reason could be a rising temperature towards the halo , according to reynolds et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "this can simply be shown if we plot theoretical oxygen line ratios per ionization fraction vs. electron temperature . as a result",
    "[ ] /h@xmath6 increases much faster with @xmath33 than [ ] /h@xmath6 or [ ] /h@xmath6 .",
    "hence , different temperature dependencies of oxygen ionization stages are able to reflect the observed gradients .      the most surprising result revealed by our deep spectra concerns the kinematics of dig at large @xmath14 .",
    "the bright emission lines of hydrogen , nitrogen , and oxygen have been used to derive heliocentric velocities for the dig as a function of @xmath14 ( vertical distance above the plane ) . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] the gas velocity is with @xmath34kms@xmath20 highest at @xmath14=0kpc and @xmath311.6kpc , decreasing slowly towards larger @xmath14 distances , finally reaching values close or equal to the systemic velocity of 1681 km s@xmath20 ( irwin @xcite ) at @xmath35kpc .",
    "the measured trend is explainable assuming the dig not to rotate at high galactic @xmath14 .",
    "a similar result was recently reported by rand ( @xcite ) for two different slit positions .",
    "this allows us to examine whether the halo dig rotates regularly since our slit position and slit 1 of rand ( @xcite ) both have a distance of 45  from the center corresponding to 6.1kpc but on opposite sides of the disk .",
    "the maximum rotational velocities at these positions ( with respect to @xmath36 at @xmath37  2kpc ) deviate only by 4kms@xmath20 and the dependence of @xmath38 is to first order in agreement with a projected regular velocity field .",
    "however , different gradients imply that the kinematics of the dig halo is more complex than a symmetric and static model would allow for .",
    "this requires more modelling including the shape of the dark matter potential and possible influences of outflow kinematics .",
    "the resolution of our spectra unfortunately is unsufficient to check for the velocity dispersion of the lines .",
    "since our spectra have very high sensitivity at very good spatial resolution , fig .",
    "[ f3 ] also indicates some small - scale structure in the velocity field with localized minima at @xmath37 @xmath318.5 , @xmath314.0 , 1.5 , 5.2 , and 9.5kpc .",
    "close to the disk , in particular in the ne , these changes can be explained by dust obscuration ,  shifting \" the peak velocity at the center to @xmath14=@xmath39kpc .",
    "an r - band image of ngc5775 gives evidence for large amounts of dust , mainly in the northern part , extending from the disk plane 1.8kpc into the halo .",
    "the kinematical structures at larger @xmath14 are not directly associated with observed dust features and hint at either an inhomogeneous dig distribution along the line of sight or effects from flows .      in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we present maps of total power , polarized intensity , and apparent polarization b - vectors at 4.86ghz overlaid upon an enhanced h@xmath6 image .",
    "ngc5775 shows an extended radio envelope which can be traced beyond 2kpc from the disk plane . while close to the disk plane the polarization b - vectors are generally disk parallel , at heights above 1kpc they form a x - like pattern , corresponding also to similarly shaped extensions of polarized intensity .    before discussing the magnetic field structure we make a comparison of the polarization information at both frequencies to estimate the possible influence of faraday rotation and depolarization .",
    "for heights less than 1kpc our estimates for a regular azimuthal magnetic field oriented parallel to the disk , assuming pressure balance with cosmic rays and typical thermal electron densities of 0.03 cm@xmath20 , imply that ngc5775 is faraday thick at 4.86ghz close to the disk plane",
    ". therefore b - vector orientations are not conclusive .",
    "however , a reasonable agreement between the orientations of polarization angles at 4.86ghz and 1.49ghz , a relatively high polarization degree ( reaching 30% ) at 4.86ghz , and the depolarization at 1.49ghz by a factor of about 0.30.4 support the assumption that above 1kpc the halo of ngc5775 is faraday - thin down to 1.49ghz .",
    "thus , if the b - vector orientations at two frequencies differ there locally by some tens of degrees , the rotation angle at 1.49ghz is smaller than @xmath41 , hence the faraday rotation bias at 4.86ghz does not exceed @xmath42",
    ". however , in the sw part of the halo ( r.a.@xmath43 dec@xmath44 ) , similar orientations of b - vectors at both frequencies are apparently in conflict with the depolarization at 1.49ghz by a factor of 0.1 , which raises the suspicion that it might be faraday - thick . on the other hand numerical simulations",
    "show that this depolarization can also be due to pure faraday dispersion in random fields , without substantial faraday rotation .    from the above comparison",
    "we conclude that the observed b - vectors at 4.86ghz in the halo at heights @xmath45 1kpc are not significantly affected by faraday rotation and that therefore the magnetic field in the halo has a significant vertical component .",
    "such a vertical magnetic field component strong enough to be seen in emission can be generated in two ways .",
    "a spherically blowing galactic wind could result in an enhanced vertical component of the magnetic field . while the poloidal magnetic",
    "field preserves its quadrupole symmetry , resulting in b - vectors parallel to the plane below @xmath14@xmath461kpc , characteristic x - shaped structures develop at larger heights ( brandenburg et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "an alternative way to obtain the vertical b - vectors is the generation of the dipolar ( called a - type ) poloidal magnetic field produced by the dynamo process .",
    "the principal condition is a rigid rotation extending over a substantial range of galactocentric radius and a large vertical scaleheight of the ionized gas , both being true for ngc5775 ( lehnert & heckman @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the b - component parallel to the disk would vanish .",
    "unfortunatley , this way of distigushing both mechanisms can not be used here because of the strong faraday effects close to the disk .",
    "however , we note that the detailed analysis of faraday rotation angles reveals field reversals across the plane ( excluding @xmath14@xmath471kpc ) in favour of a dipolar poloidal field .    whether a vertical decrease of rotational speed , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , makes this field mode growing faster remains yet to be investigated but can not be excluded .",
    "we note that the existing dynamo models which account for rotation speed falling with @xmath14 yield very different results . while little effect of vertical rotation decrease upon the dynamo efficiency was obtained for a classical dynamo concept ( brandenburg et al .",
    "1993 ) a special model of a supernova - driven dynamo by ferrire&schmitt ( @xcite ) fails in this case to generate any stable , growing magnetic field mode .",
    "the dynamo models in case of a vertical rotation drop - off can be validated if only more information on the magnetic field structure in halos along with kinematical information would be available .    however , as noted by collins et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we need to consider the influence of the vertical magnetic field structure on the cosmic ray propagation and the gas flows . to clearly demonstrate the correlation of the radio- continuum spurs with the magnetic field structure we have applied a median filter to the total power map at 1.49ghz , which revealed structural components inclined to the galaxy plane in the same x - shaped manner as the polarization b - vectors ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) .",
    "the polarization features are anchored in the disk plane with the se one being attached to a local radio bright region in the disk , most likely a star forming region .",
    "the total power spur at r.a.@xmath48 , dec@xmath49 curves towards south in its outer part ; the same behaviour is seen for the polarization vectors at both frequencies .",
    "we suspect that they are associated with cosmic ray electron streaming from intensively star - forming regions along the inclined magnetic lines .",
    "the inclined spurs extend down to the disk plane which allows us to speculate that magnetic lines may do the same , as expected for the a - mode .",
    "we also note that the cosmic ray propagation along the magnetic lines of the regular field may yield an x - shaped distribution of the polarized intensity ( fig .",
    "similarly , an easier streaming of the ionized gas along magnetic fields of the discussed geometry can give rise to the occurrence of h@xmath6-emitting spurs coincident with the radio ones and to an increased vertical scale of ionized gas in regions of magnetic structures highly inclined to the disk plane .",
    "finally we want to address the question whether the energy stored in the magnetic field could in principal help solving the heating problem discussed in sect .",
    "magnetic reconnection as a heat source for dig was suggested earlier , e.g. , by birk et al .",
    "( @xcite ) or reynolds et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , the latter based on an analogy from solar physics proposed by raymond ( @xcite ) . in the following we use the heating rate for magnetic reconnection @xmath50 as derived by lesch & bender ( @xcite ) : @xmath51 , with @xmath52 the alf ' en velocity and @xmath53 the dissipation length . for characteristic regions in the spurs the minimum total magnetic field strength implied by the pressure balance with cosmic rays is @xmath545@xmath25 g . with this value",
    "we obtain the required heating rates as determined by reynolds at al .",
    "( @xcite ) for dig densities of typically @xmath55@xmath56 if @xmath53 is in the order of parsec , not unreasonable for structures in the ism .",
    "since this heating rate depends on the alf ' en velocity and thus on @xmath57 the increasing importance of the additional heating source with decreasing particle density would be a natural consequence .",
    "reconnection could also be responsible for the growth of ordered magnetic field structures in the spurs .",
    "it has been suggested that this process could help to reorganize the field structure in a galactic fountain flow ( e.g. , kahn @xcite ) .",
    "the most important results can be summarized as follows :    * emission lines of dig can be traced out to 9kpc in the halo of ngc5775 * the rotational velocity of the dig drops from the rotational value at the midplane and approaches the systemic velocity at distances @xmath586.0kpc * pure photoionization models are unable to reproduce the extreme line ratios of [ ] /@xmath2 , /@xmath3 , and [ ] /@xmath2 as measured for the halo * a high degree of polarization and a strong vertical component of the magnetic field are observed in the halo .",
    "we found some , yet weak evidence for the dipolar magnetic field * a correlation exists between extraplanar dig and magnetic fields , evidenced by the alignment of magnetic b - vectors with prominent halo features in the dig and radio - continuum distribution * we suggest that reconnection processes play a substantial role in both heating the dig structures in the halo and building up regular fields away from the disk plane    rt acknowledges support through the eso studentship programme .",
