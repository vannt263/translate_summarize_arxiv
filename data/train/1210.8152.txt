    "we make a connection between theory and observations , which allows us to directly probe the sgrb progenitors . in particular , we consider a complete ( to date ) sample of sgrbs with measured redshifts , and link the properties of their observed emissions to the masses of the tori responsible for their generation . by comparing these tori with the theoretical predictions of  @xcite and of  @xcite",

    "in particular the torus mass is determined as    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "as shown in  @xcite and  @xcite , the gw signal is strongly affected by the mass of the system and how close this is to the maximum mass for each particular eos .",
    "bnss with masses close to the maximum mass exhibit a prompt collapse to bh after the merger , while lower - mass systems produce an hmns which can survive from few ms up to hundreds of ms  @xcite .",
    "gw signals from `` high - mass '' systems are simply composed of the inspiral , merger , and bh ring - down phases .",
    "lower - mass systems , instead , display a more complex gw signal with a rich spectrum due to the emission of gws from the hmns formed after the merger .",
    "such emission is important since it can help infer the properties of the ns eos  @xcite .",
    "however , since the gw signal emitted by the hmns is in a range of frequencies between @xmath164khz and @xmath165khz  @xcite , it may be difficult for advanced ligo / virgo to detect it , and a third generation of detectors , such as the einstein telescope , would be required  @xcite . on the other hand , the formation of an hmns after the merger can also be inferred by measuring the delay time between the bns merger ( indicated by the gw signal ) and the time of the emission of the sgrb ( which we may assume coincident with bh formation ) .",
    "a delay time of @xmath166 ms or larger would clearly indicate the formation of an hmns .    as discussed in section",
    "[ bnstori ] , we find that only the most energetic sgrbs can be compatible with a low - mass binary and hence the formation of an hmns . for the greatest majority of sgrbs ,",
    "a high - mass system is the most likely scenario , and hence we expect sgrbs to be observed simultaneously with gws which would lack the high - frequency emission typical of the hmns . although the gw signal from a prompt collapse is not as rich as that from an hmns , the simultaneous detection of an sgrb with the associated gw may help considerably in constraining the ns eos .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ figure2 ] with a selection of three sgrbs from our sample ( with low , medium , and high energetics ) . in each panel , the horizontal dashed line represents the value of @xmath167 reported in table  [ grbtable ] , while the shaded region represents the range of @xmath9 assuming a total efficiency @xmath168 between 1% and 10% .",
    "the various points represent @xmath167 computed from simulations of bns mergers using different eoss ( see table  [ bnstori_table ] ) .",
    "if an sgrb was detected together with a gw signal , we could use the energetic of the burst to determine the torus mass ( horizontal bars in figure  [ figure2 ] ) , while the gw signal could be used to infer the mass of the bnss ( which would give a vertical bar in those panels ) .",
    "the combination of these two pieces of information would restrict the allowed eos parameter space .    in the case of ns - bh binaries ,",
    "the mass ratio @xmath93 and the spin of the bh can in principle be measured via gw observations ; then a simultaneous detection of a gw and an sgrb would allow to set an independent constraint on the ns compactness @xmath169 and hence infer the ns eos .",
    "we have performed a novel analysis of the energetics of sgrbs in connection with the properties of the compact binary systems that may have generated them .",
    "we have shown that most of the sgrbs could be produced by magnetized tori with masses lower than @xmath170 . combining this information with the results of numerical simulations of ns - ns and ns - bh mergers ,",
    "we have concluded that most of the sgrbs are consistent with the merger of `` high - mass '' bns systems , i.e. , with @xmath171 .",
    "while ns - bh systems can not be completely excluded , the bh would need to have an initial spin of @xmath3 , or higher .",
    "moreover , the most energetic sgrbs , such as grb090510 , could not be produced by the merger of an ns with a bh .",
    "we note that while our results are affected by some uncertainty in the exact value of the efficiency @xmath168 , our conclusions are robust as long as @xmath172 ( i.e. , @xmath173 ) , which is much lower than what was observed in grmhd simulations of jets from accretion disks  @xcite .",
    "gw signals from sgrbs would help validate our results .",
    "in particular , in the case of bnss , since we find that sgrbs are most likely generated by `` high - mass '' bnss , the gw signal would lack the features that are associated with the formation of an hmns , since `` high - mass '' bnss produce a prompt collapse to bh a few ms after merger . a simultaneous detection of gws with sgrbs would help constrain the eos of ns matter .",
