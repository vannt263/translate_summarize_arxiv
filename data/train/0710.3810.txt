    "their impact on mathematics and computer science has been enormous , not only because of specific algorithms based on combinatorial bounds but also because they have triggered the development of theoretical and practical methods that turned out to be applicable elsewhere .",
    "some of the most simply formulated yet notoriously hard erds type problems occur in combinatorial geometry . in 1946 , erds  @xcite asked two questions on distances : ( 1 ) at most how many times can a given distance occur among @xmath0 points in the plane ; ( 2 ) what is the minimum number of distinct distances determined by @xmath0 points in the plane ?",

    "no asymptotically tight bound is known for this problem for @xmath15 , ( and it is trivial for @xmath16 by lenz - type constructions ) .",
    "pach and sharir  @xcite derived bounds on the maximum number of occurrences of the same angle determined by a planar @xmath0-element point set ; recently apfelbaum and sharir  @xcite studied the analogous problem in three - space . a recent book by bra , moser , and pach  @xcite and a survey of pach and sharir  @xcite provide substantial details on these and other similar problems .",
    "in the sequel , we focus on problems about the extremal number of simplices with certain volume properties in a point set .    in 1967 , a.  oppenheim ( see @xcite ) asked what is the maximum number of unit area triangles determined by @xmath0 points in the plane .",
