    "one of the important tools for studying the properties of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is the analysis of a qcd jet production .",
    "the medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , `` jet quenching '' , should be very different in the cold nuclear matter and qgp , resulting in many observable phenomena  @xcite .",
    "recent rhic data on high - p@xmath0 particle production at @xmath1 gev are in agreement with the jet quenching hypothesis  @xcite . at lhc , a new regime of heavy ion physics will be reached at @xmath2 tev where hard and semi - hard particle production can stand out against the underlying soft events .",
    "the initial gluon densities in pb+pb reactions at lhc are expected to be much higher than those at rhic , implying a stronger partonic energy loss , observable in new channels .    in the most of available monte - carlo heavy ion event generators the medium - induced partonic rescattering and energy loss",
    "are either ignored or implemented insufficiently .",
    "thus , in order to analyze rhic data on high - p@xmath0 hadron production and to test the sensitivity of lhc observables to the qgp formation , the development of adequate and fast monte - carlo tool to simulate the jet quenching is necessary .",
    "the detailed description of physics model can be found in our recent paper  @xcite .",
    "the approach bases on an accumulating energy loss , the gluon radiation being associated with each parton scattering in the longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid and includes the interference effect using the modified radiation spectrum @xmath3 as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the basic kinetic integral equation for the energy loss @xmath5 as a function of initial energy @xmath6 and path length @xmath7 has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the current transverse coordinate of a parton , @xmath10 is the scattering probability density , @xmath3 is the energy loss per unit length , @xmath11 is in - medium mean free path . the collisional loss in high - momentum transfer limit , radiative loss in bdms approximation  @xcite , simple gaussian parameterization of gluon emission angle distribution and realistic nuclear geometry are used . the qgp proper formation time",
    "@xmath12 and initial temperature @xmath13 are model parameters .",
    "the model has been constructed as the monte - carlo event generator pyquen ( pythia quenched ) and is available via internet  @xcite .",
    "the event - by - event simulation procedure includes the generation of the initial parton spectra with pythia  @xcite and production vertexes at given impact parameter , rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path length in a dense zone , radiative and collisional energy loss per rescattering , final hadronization with the lund string model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "the full heavy ion event is simulated as a superposition of soft hydro - type state and hard multi - jets .",
    "the simple approximation  @xcite of hadronic liquid at `` freeze - out '' stage has been used to treat soft part of the event .",
    "then the hard part of the event includes pyquen multi - jets generated according to the binomial distribution .",
    "the mean number of jets produced in aa events at a given impact parameter is a product of the number of binary nn sub - collisions and the integral cross section of hard process in pp collisions with the minimal transverse momentum transfer @xmath14 .",
    "the extended in such a way model has been also constructed as the fast monte - carlo event generator  @xcite .",
    "note that ideologically similar approximation has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the model , the jet quenching pattern in au+au collisions at rhic was considered .",
    "model parameters has been selected from the fit of @xmath15 and @xmath16 spectra at rhic for different event centralities ( see  @xcite for details ) . in particular , the nuclear modification of the hardest domain of @xmath17-spectrum",
    "was used to extract initial qgp conditions : @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 fm/@xmath20 .",
    "figure [ rhic_rpt ] shows that our model reproduce @xmath16 and centrality dependences of nuclear modification factor @xmath21 ( determined as a ratio of particle yields in @xmath22 and pp collisions normalized on the number of binary nn sub - collisions ) for @xmath23 s measured by phenix  @xcite quite well . another important tool to verify jet quenching is two - particle azimuthal correlation function @xmath24  the distribution over an azimuthal angle of high-@xmath17 hadrons in the event with @xmath25 gev/@xmath26 relative to that for the hardest `` trigger '' particle with @xmath27 gev/@xmath20 .",
    "figure [ rhic_btb ] presents @xmath24 in pp and in central au+au collisions ( data from star  @xcite ) .",
    "clear peaks in pp collisions at @xmath28 and @xmath29 indicate a typical dijet event topology",
    ". however , for central au+au collisions the peak near @xmath30 disappears .",
    "it can be interpreted as the observation of monojet events due to the absorption of one of the jets in a dense medium .",
    "figure [ rhic_btb ] demonstrates that measured suppression of azimuthal back - to - back correlations is well reproduced by our model .     ]     ]    we leave beyond the scope of this paper the analysis of such important rhic observables as the azimuthal anisotropy and particle ratios , which are sensitive to the soft physics . in order to study them , a more careful treatment of low-@xmath17 particle production than our simple approach",
    "is needed  @xcite ( the detailed description of space - time structure of freeze - out region , resonance decays , etc . ) .",
    "the developed model was applied to analyze various novel features of jet quenching at the lhc ( see  @xcite for details ) .",
    "let us just to enumerate some main issues .",
    "_ jets tagged by leading hadrons . _",
    "the relation between in - medium softening jet fragmentation function ( measured with leading hadrons ) and suppression of jet rates due to energy loss out of jet cone , was analyzed in the work  @xcite .",
    "the specific anti - correlation between two effects allows one to probe parton energy loss mechanism ( small - angular radiation versus wide - angular radiation and collisional loss ) .    _ jets induced by heavy quarks . _",
    "the possibility to observe b - jets tagged by an energetic muon in heavy ion collisions was analyzed in the work  @xcite .",
    "the significant softening b - jet fragmentation function due to b - quark energy loss is predicted .    _",
    "z/@xmath31+jet production . _",
    "the channel with dimuon tagged jet production in heavy ion collisions was analyzed in the work  @xcite .",
    "we have found that the medium - induced partonic energy loss can result in significant @xmath32-imbalance between @xmath33 pair and a leading particle in a jet , which is quite visible even for moderate loss .",
    "the method to simulate jet quenching in heavy ion collisions has been developed .",
    "the model is the fast monte - carlo tool implemented to modify a standard pythia jet event .",
    "the full heavy ion event is obtained as a superposition of a soft hydro - type state and hard multi - jets .",
    "the model is capable of reproducing main features of the jet quenching pattern at rhic ( the @xmath16dependence of the nuclear modification factor and the suppression of azimuthal back - to - back correlations ) .",
    "the model was also applied to probe jet quenching in various new channels at lhc energy : jets tagged by leading particles , b - jets , dilepton - jet correlations .",
    "the further development of the model focusing on a more detailed description of low-@xmath17 particle production is in the progress .",
