    "however , in many cases , such as for example in complex systems with effective complicated potentials , the metropolis method and its variants are more or less inadequate methods  @xcite .",
    "noteworthy , the traditional importance sampling methods are not very efficient in recording of the very small probabilities in the tails of the critical order - parameter distribution  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why many different simulation approaches  @xcite in recent times have failed in establishing the true tail behavior of this distribution .    in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] , we briefly review a new simple technique , the crmes method , which yields an immense speed up of all popular algorithms , which are used to sample the density of energy states ( dos ) of a statistical system in the last decade . provided that , the temperature range of interest is only the range around the critical temperature that determines all finite - size anomalies , our technique can be combined with any of the dos methods  @xcite to speed up the simulations and establish a different methodology for the determination of the critical exponents by studying the finite - size scaling of the extensions of the dominant subspaces . in the same section",

    "in fact , it has been numerically verified that the finite - size extensions ( denoted by @xmath18 ) close to a critical point obey the scaling law  @xcite : @xmath19 to locate the crmes we may follow the method described in  @xcite , or an even simpler restriction  @xcite based on the energy probability density @xmath20 . using this later approach , we may define the end - points @xmath21 of the subspaces by simply comparing the corresponding probability densities with the maximum at the energy @xmath3 : @xmath22 alternative definitions for the crmes have been described and tested in ref .  @xcite using the 2d ising model  @xcite , the 3d ising model  @xcite and the baxter - wu model  @xcite .",

    "let us now discuss the idea of producing accurate estimates for finite - size magnetic anomalies by using a simple method based on a wl random walk in an appropriately restricted energy subspace @xmath27 . implementing this scheme we , at the same time ,",

    "the accuracy of the magnetic properties obtained from the above averaging process depends on many factors .",

    "the high - level recipes wl@xmath38 and their n - fold versions wl(n - fold:@xmath39 give excellent estimates , as shown in detail in ref .",
    "the extensions of the crmes defined with the help of the thermal finite - size anomalies ( specific heat maximum and energy cumulant minimum ) , and also with the help of magnetic finite - size anomaly ( susceptibility maximum ) obey a clear logarithmic dependence on the lattice size  @xcite , as should be expected for the 2d ising model .",
    "consider now the probability density of the order - parameter at some temperature of interest @xmath40 : @xmath41 if @xmath42 is the value that maximizes ( [ eq:9 ] ) , we locate the critical minimum magnetic subspaces ( crmms ) by : @xmath43 and we should expect the following scaling law to hold : @xmath44    illustration of the universal scaling function @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]    in figs .",

    "it is clear that the law ( [ eq:11 ] ) is very well satisfied and the estimation of @xmath50 via this route is quite good , giving @xmath51 for @xmath6 and @xmath52 for @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "it is of interest to point out that , an attempt to estimate @xmath50 using this route and the metropolis algorithm will most likely yield a marked underestimation , which will be more pronounced for the case @xmath16 .",
    "this effect , has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and is a result of the very slow equilibration process of this algorithm in the far tail regime of the order - parameter distribution .",

    "the tail regime of this universal distribution has been a matter of increasing interest in the last decade  @xcite .",
    "the main theme is the verification of the following conjecture for the large-@xmath55 behavior of @xmath45  @xcite : @xmath56 with : @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 universal constants .",

    "the points correspond to the ratio of the best fit value of the exponent to the expected value @xmath62 ( to be compared with fig .",

    "the studies of  @xcite have provided some evidence for this conjecture and in particular for the prefactor and the relation of the exponent @xmath60 to the critical exponent @xmath53 .",
    "for the 2d ising model the exponent should have the value @xmath63 , if , of course , the prefactor hypothesis is valid .",
    "smith and bruce  @xcite provided numerical support for this value , but their study was not completely conclusive since it was carried out only for relatively small lattices ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) and the @xmath55-window in which the value @xmath63 was observed was actually quite narrow .",
    "we now present results for several lattice sizes ( @xmath66 , and @xmath67 ) reinforcing this conjecture in a very wide @xmath55-window . following smith and bruce",

    "the picture is similar to that presented in ref .",

    "in fact the shown @xmath55-window @xmath77 produces good estimates for all lattice sizes @xmath61 as should be expected by thoroughly inspecting fig .",
    "in the present work we described the basic ideas and formalism behind the recently developed by the authors  @xcite critical minimum energy(magnetization ) subspace crme(m)s technique , appearing as an alternative computational method for the estimation of critical behavior of statistical systems .",
    "we presume that this new promising route will increase our comprehension of the development of the critical behavior as the lattice size increases and will further facilitate the estimation of critical exponents via finite - size scaling .",
    "it is hoped that the presented crmes wang - landau entropic sampling will provide an efficient and reliable scheme for the study of complex systems , such as the random - field ising model and systems with competing interactions , where the critical behavior is still controversial .",
    "furthermore , the efficiency of our approach enabled us to present here reliable data for large lattices and to clarify the asymptotic tail behavior of the universal critical distribution of the order - parameter of the 2d ising model .",
    "this should be contrasted to the fact that all previous studies of the far tail regime of this distribution  @xcite have considered rather small lattices ."
