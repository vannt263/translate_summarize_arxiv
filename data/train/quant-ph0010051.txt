    "the recent creation of neutral atom bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite stimulated theoretical research aimed at understanding this new state of matter .",
    "models of two coupled becs in a two mode approximation are considered a tractable system when total particle number is conserved and eigenstates of the two well system are labeled by the particle number difference between the wells .",
    "two coupled becs in a symmetric double - well potential has been analyzed with the use of the su(2 ) group @xcite to show the dynamical transition from self - trapping in one well to delocalized oscillation through both potential wells due to the nonlinear particle interaction .",
    "this model in the weak coupling region has been further shown to demonstrate @xmath0-phase oscillations @xcite , while a semiclassical functional expression for the three - dimensional josephson coupling energy have been derived @xcite .",
    "this model , however , can be considered as a special case because of its simplicity and low - dimensionality .",
    "any extension of this model significantly increase the nonlinearity while higher dimensional effects increase the complexity of the model structure .",
    "these more complex systems are of interest as the richer dynamics and model structure allows us to treat quantum states with non - zero currents , for instance . in the limit of large mode number @xmath1 ,",
    "bose - hubbard type approaches are useful using a mean field approximation @xcite",
    ". however systems with intermediate numbers of modes , @xmath2 , are complex and models must exploit system symmetries in order to obtain solutions .",
    "the symmetries of these groups are the su(n ) group symmetries . in this paper",
    "we analyze a three coupled bec system using the operator algebra of su(3 ) .",
    "this could be realized as three spatially separated atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) as illustrated in the right corner of fig .",
    "alternatively it could describe a three condensates , occupying a single trap and distinguished by three internal hyperfine atomic states .",
    "the spatially separated system could represent a bec confined in a three dimensional trapping potential with three harmonic minima in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "tunneling is possible between all three minima .",
    "this symmetric triple - well system represents the simplest two - dimensional generalization of the one dimensional double - well @xcite which allows states of non - zero angular momentum .",
    "if the nonlinear interaction between the atoms is not too large , see @xcite ( that is the total number of atoms @xmath4 is not too big ) , we can describe this system using a minimum of three bose modes for the quantum field ; @xmath5,\\ ] ] where the @xmath6 are an appropriate set of orthonormal single - particle mode functions for this potential , and the annihilation and creation operators @xmath7 satisfy the equal time commutation relations @xmath8=\\delta_{ij}.\\ ] ]    as in the double - well case @xcite , we can choose approximate single particle mode functions which are the localized single particle ground states for each of the three wells .",
    "we further assume that these three lowest localized states are sufficiently well separated from higher energy states , and that interactions between particles do not change this basic property of the system configuration .",
    "finally we assume that the total number of particles @xmath4 are conserved .",
    "these assumptions allow us to treat this model system in a three mode approximation .",
    "hence , the many - body hamiltonian describing atomic becs @xcite can be written in terms of the mode operators as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mode frequency , @xmath11 is the two particle interaction strength and @xmath12 is the tunneling frequency .",
    "the condition , @xmath13 , corresponds to atoms with attractive interactions .",
    "this is the hamiltonian of our model system in this paper .",
    "this section shows the group theoretical treatment of the system with the hamiltonian specified in ( [ h - in - b ] ) . in order to describe this system with su(3 ) generators , we extend the schwinger boson method @xcite and we define the eight generators of su(3 ) @xmath14 as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we note that the two operators @xmath18 commute with each other . @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    "represent particle distributions projected on the y and x axes respectively in the right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and @xmath21 corresponds to angular momentum in this system . the most important relation which the generators satisfy is the casimir invariant of su(3 ) , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the total number operator , @xmath24 .",
    "the operator algebra implies three further important identities ; @xmath25 with the use of su(3 ) generators , we can represent the hamiltonian ( [ h - in - b ] ) in the form @xmath26 here we ignore constant terms involving the conserved total number of particles @xmath23 which do not change the dynamics of the system .",
    "we now specifically consider the case with @xmath27 and @xmath13 .",
    "such condensates are necessarily limited to a small number of atoms@xcite .",
    "for attractive forces , the ground state is three - fold degenerate and in the occupation number representation ( @xmath28 .",
    "we treat the three coupled bec model using the semiclassical mean - field approximation .",
    "ignoring correlations between all operators and taking expectation values converts the eight operator differential equations for the su(3 ) generators in the quantum system into eight differential equations for real variables in the semiclassical system .",
    "it is , however , very difficult to analytically solve the full eight dimensional equations .",
    "this leads us to consider a specific simplified subspace of the set of eight equations by taking the symmetric condition , @xmath29 .",
    "the nature of this condition will be explained in subsection @xmath30 below as to see the dynamics clearly we first need to scale the semiclassical variables .",
    "the expectation values of generators are distinguished by their subscripts , while the expectation value of the total number operator is @xmath4 .",
    "it is convenient to scale all the semiclassical averages by @xmath4 .",
    "thus we define , @xmath31 the equations of motion can be derived from the heisenberg equations of motion of the hamiltonian ( [ newh - in - b ] ) , by factoring all higher order moments .",
    "the three degenerate ground states for @xmath27 can be associated with particular initial conditions in the semiclassical limit . to see this",
    "we first note that if we take matrix elements of both sides of the three operator identities in eq .",
    "( [ oper - ident ] ) we find that @xmath32 using the commutation relations for @xmath33 and the corresponding uncertainty relations with respect to the ground states it is possible to show that the ground state variances in @xmath34 scale as @xmath4 for @xmath35 . in physical terms",
    "this means that the relative fluctuations in these variables goes to zero as @xmath36 , as expected for a semiclassical limit .",
    "this indicates that in the semiclassical limit we may approximate @xmath37    the resulting semiclassical equations will be analyzed from two perspectives .",
    "we first show a dynamical transition between self - trapping and delocalization when initial conditions are given by eq .",

    "this analysis determines the critical point for the dynamics transition .",
    "secondly we consider the dependence of the stable points on the ratio of the coupling between condensates to the particle - particle interaction strength , and show bifurcations in the set of the stable points .      using these relations in eq .",
    "( [ orbits ] ) we can construct semiclassical correspondences for each of the ground states .",
    "this is shown below @xmath38 it is easy to verify that these curves are invariant under the semiclassical dynamics with @xmath27 .",
    "as each of the ground states is equivalent , up to a rotation in the phase space , we will now restrict the discussion to @xmath39 ( a condensate localized initially in the third well ) without loss of generality , and examine the dynamics when @xmath40 .",
    "use of the initial state @xmath41 naturally restricts the dynamics due to system symmetries , allowing us to study an analytically solvable subsystem .",
    "the initial state @xmath41 and the hamiltonian ( [ newh - in - b ] ) are symmetric to permutations of wells 1 and 2 , then the resulting dynamics also satisfy this symmetry .",
    "this ensures that @xmath29 for all time in the semiclassical limit , which we previously referred to as the symmetric condition .",
    "this symmetric condition specifies the subspace in which the reduced system dynamics lies , giving the additional conditions , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the semiclassical dynamics is governed by the following four dimensional system @xmath45 the initial state @xmath41 gives the semiclassical system the initial conditions @xmath46 the semiclassical dynamics governed by the equations of motion ( [ semi eq ] ) is numerically shown in fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] shows a transition from localization to global oscillation , and this dynamics change can be explained by the stable point analysis .",
    "this reduced system is integrable as these equations satisfy two constants of motion ; @xmath47 which correspond to energy and total number conservation respectively",
    ". the latter constant ( [ number_cons ] ) follows from two stricter constraints @xmath48 which are derived from eq .",
    "( [ oper - ident ] ) with the symmetric condition in the semiclassical limit .",

    "the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle intersect , forming a lopsided figure eight like separatrix with the new elliptic fixed point in the one lobe and the elliptic fixed point at a in the other . when @xmath59 is @xmath73 the hyperbola reduces to the lines @xmath74 and the solutions in @xmath75 space are symmetrical about @xmath76 .",
    "if @xmath59 is further decreased the separatrix approaches our initial condition ( [ initial ] ) . at @xmath77",
    "the initial condition actually lies on the separatrix .",
    "this occurs when the unstable fixed point lies on the solution curve ( [ solutions ] ) , which amounts to looking for a double root of @xmath58 .",

    "now for @xmath85 the solutions lie within the separatrix and so as @xmath59 is decreased through @xmath86 the oscillations suddenly reduce to half their former size as can be clearly seen in fig .  [ fig1 ] .    in the physical space of the potential then , the condensate remains localized at the bottom of the first well,@xmath69 , for @xmath87 .",
    "as we increase @xmath59 from zero , @xmath88 begins to oscillate . in the @xmath89 plane ,",
    "the point is replaced by small oscillations , within the separatrix , which pass through @xmath90 .",
    "this is referred to as dynamical localization .",
    "even though the coupling between wells is present , the nonlinear interaction between particles prevents the condensate from moving away from its initially localized state .",

    "the transition from localized to delocalized oscillations is apparent .",
    "in this section we treat the three coupled bec model fully quantum mechanically and numerically calculate the time evolution of the particle distribution with the initial condition @xmath39 . for fixed total atom number @xmath23 , a suitable basis of the system hilbert space is the number eigenstates @xmath94 which are simultaneous eigenstates of the generators , @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the abelian sub - algebra of su(3 ) .",

    "the oscillations of the quantum mean values decay due to the intrinsic quantum fluctuations in the number of atoms in each individual well , while the total particle number in the system remains fixed .",
    "the collapses and revivals of the oscillations in the quantum system arise from the discrete nature of the eigenvalue spectrum for finite atom number .",
