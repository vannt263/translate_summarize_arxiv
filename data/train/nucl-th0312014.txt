    "a recent experiment by leps collaboration at spring-8/osaka  @xcite has found a clear signal for an @xmath2 positive charge resonance around 1540 mev .",
    "the finding , also confirmed by diana at itep  @xcite , clas at jefferson lab .",
    "@xcite and saphir at elsa  @xcite , might correspond to the exotic state predicted by diakonov _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the challenge now is to determine the @xmath1 quantum numbers through some reaction .",
    "we present one particularly suited reaction  @xcite with the process @xmath3 which has some peculiar features since there are no resonances in the initial state and by choosing small momenta of the @xmath4 , we shall be also far away from the @xmath5 resonance and hence the @xmath6 resonance signal can be more clearly seen .    a successful model for the reaction eq .",
    "( [ eq : reaction ] ) was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , consisting of the mechanisms depicted in terms of feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "@xcite.,width=340 ]    the term ( a ) ( pion pole ) and ( b ) ( contact term ) which are easily obtained from the chiral lagrangians involving meson - meson  @xcite and meson - baryon interaction  @xcite are spin flip terms ( proportional to @xmath7 ) , while the @xmath8 exchange term ( diagram ( c ) ) contains both a spin flip and a non spin flip part .",
    "having an amplitude proportional to @xmath7 is important in the present context in order to have a test of the parity of the resonance .",
    "hence we choose a situation , with the final pion momentum @xmath9 small compared to the momentum of the initial kaon , such that the diagram ( c ) , which contains the @xmath10 operator can be safely neglected .",
    "the terms of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) will provide the bulk for this reaction .",
    "if there is a resonant state for @xmath11 then this will be seen in the final state interaction of this system .",
    "this means that in addition to the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we shall have those in fig .  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "feynman diagrams of the reaction @xmath0 with the @xmath1 resonance.,width=302 ]    if the resonance is an @xmath12-wave @xmath11 resonance then @xmath13 .",
    "if it is a @xmath14-wave resonance , we can have @xmath15 .",
    "the restriction to have small pion momenta eliminates also other possible mechanisms involving crossed resonance exchange .",
    "we write the couplings of the resonance to @xmath11 as @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath12-wave and @xmath14-wave with @xmath19 respectively , and relate them to the @xmath1 width via    @xmath20    a straightforward evaluation of the meson pole and contact terms leads to the @xmath21 amplitudes @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for the final state @xmath24 respectively and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial and final @xmath27 momenta .",
    "now let us turn to the resonance diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] containing a loop integral , which is initiated by the tree diagrams of figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "when taking into account @xmath28 scattering through the @xmath1 resonance , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , the @xmath0 amplitude is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 account for the scattering terms with intermediate @xmath11 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "they are given by @xmath33 for @xmath12- and @xmath14-wave , and @xmath23 for @xmath11 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "we take an initial three momenta of @xmath27 in the laboratory frame @xmath34 mev@xmath35 ( @xmath36 mev ) , which allows us to span @xmath11 invariant masses up to @xmath37 mev , thus covering the peak of the @xmath1 , and still is small enough to have negligible @xmath4 momenta with respect to the one of the incoming @xmath27 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , we show the invariant mass distribution @xmath38 in the @xmath27 forward direction ( @xmath39 . here we see that , independently of the quantum numbers of @xmath1 , a resonance signal is always observed .",
    "the signals for the resonance are quite clear for the case of @xmath40 ( these would be the quantum numbers predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath41 , while in the other cases the signal is weaker and the background more important , particularly for the case of @xmath40 .",
    "the calculations are done with a @xmath42 width of 20 mev , an experimental upper bound .",
    "should the width be smaller , the strength at the peak of our calculation would be the same but the distributions would be narrower .",
    "the double differential cross sections @xmath38 with @xmath43 ( forward direction ) for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    "( [ eq : tilde ] ) account for the resonance contribution to the process .",
    "the interesting finding there is that if the @xmath1 couples to @xmath11 in @xmath12-wave ( hence negative parity ) the amplitude goes as @xmath46 while if it couples in @xmath14-wave it has a term @xmath47 .",
    "hence , a possible polarization test to determine which one of the couplings the resonances chooses is to measure the cross section for initial proton polarization @xmath48 in the direction @xmath49 @xmath50 and final neutron polarization @xmath51 ( the experiment can be equally done with @xmath32 in the final state , which makes the nucleon detection easier ) .",
    "in this spin flip amplitude @xmath52 , the @xmath46 term vanishes . with this test",
    "the resonance signal disappears for the @xmath12-wave case , while the @xmath47 operator of the @xmath14-wave case would have a finite matrix element proportional to @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] we show the results for the polarized cross section measured at 90 degrees as a function of the invariant mass .",
    "the two cases with s - wave do not show any resonant shape since only the background contributes .",
    "all the other cross sections are quite reduced to the point that the only sizeable resonant peak comes from the @xmath40 case .",
