    "nearly a decade ago , observations with the _ compton_/batse all - sky monitor revealed that the 38  s accretion - powered x - ray pulsar oao  1657@xmath0415 ( @xmath14 , @xmath1503 ) is in a 10.4  d eclipsing binary with an unidentified b  supergiant companion ( chakrabarty et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the nature of the mass donor was inferred from x - ray timing measurements and the x - ray eclipse duration .",
    "only six other eclipsing x - ray pulsars are known , and all of them yield important constraints on the neutron star mass range ( van kerkwijk , van paradijs , & zuiderwijk 1995 ; chakrabarty , psaltis , & thorsett 2002 , in preparation ) . although binary radio pulsar data yield more precise neutron star mass measurements ( thorsett & chakrabarty 1997 ) , the x - ray binaries generally trace a different evolutionary path and therefore may have a systematically different mass range .",
    "oao  1657@xmath0415 is also unique among the known high - mass x - ray binaries in that it appears to occupy a transition region between mass transfer via a stellar wind and roche - lobe overflow , with possible episodic formation of an accretion disk ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "1993 ; bildsten et al . 1997 ; baykal 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "since the binary is too wide for roche lobe overflow to occur , this may provide the first clear evidence that the winds in high - mass x - ray binaries possess sufficient angular momentum to form accretion disks .",
    "identification of the supergiant companion and follow - up spectroscopy would permit both a neutron star mass measurement as well as a search for accretion disk signatures .",
    "however , optical identification has been hampered by the source s poorly known x - ray position .",
    "the most precise previous measurement was derived from a 0.54.0  kev _ einstein_/ipc image ( parmar et al . 1980 ) .",

    "previous optical work has shown that there are no ob supergiants in the _ einstein _ error circle with magnitude @xmath19 ( roche 1993 ; maxwell , norton , & roche 2001 ) , indicating that the luminous optical counterpart is also subject to heavy extinction .    in this letter , we report a precise position measurement of oao  1657@xmath0415 using the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and the identification of an infrared counterpart , presumably an ob supergiant .",
    "we discuss our imaging observations ( x - ray , optical , and infrared ) in  2 , our x - ray spectroscopy in  3 , and the implications of our observations in  4 .",
    "we observed oao 1657@xmath0415 with _ chandra _ on 2001 february 10 for 5.1  ks using the high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) and the spectroscopy array of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) .",
    "the hetgs employs two sets of transmission gratings : the medium energy gratings ( megs ; 0.45.0  kev ) and the high energy gratings ( hegs ; 0.810.0  kev ) .",
    "the hetgs spectra were imaged by acis - s , an array of six ccd detectors .",
    "the hetgs / acis - s combination provides an undispersed ( zeroth - order ) image    = 8.5 cm    and dispersed spectra from the gratings .",
    "the various orders overlap and are sorted using the intrinsic energy resolution of the acis ccds , which are read out every 3.2  s. pulsations were detected from oao  1657@xmath0415 at a barycentered period of 37.329@xmath200.020  s ( epoch mjd 51950.84 ) , verifying that the detected source is the pulsar . besides the pulsar , no other x - ray sources are detected in the _ chandra _ image .",
    "the zeroth order hetgs image of oao 1657@xmath0415 was affected by photon pileup ( see , e.g. , davis 2001 ) , but not so severely as to distort the image centroid .",
    "we measured the source position with the ciao tool _",

    "we derived an astrometric solution for these images by matching 12 stars in the @xmath23 image with the @xmath21 image described above .",
    "( the field of view was too small to allow a direct tie to the usno - a2.0 catalog . )",
    "the rms error in the positions was dominated by the optical fit errors . using this solution",
    ", we found a relatively bright star within 01 of the _ chandra _ position ; within the position uncertainties , these positions are coincident , and we identify this star as the infrared counterpart of oao  1657@xmath0415 .",
    "( this object is called star  10b in the infrared images of roche 1993 . ) a @xmath23 image of the field is shown in figure  2 .",
    "we flux - calibrated our infrared images by comparison with observations of photometric standards at various airmasses ( persson et al .",
    "1998 ) . the measured _ jhk@xmath22 _ magnitudes are given in table  1 , and are similar to those measured by roche ( 1993 )",
    "our short _ chandra_/hetgs observation also yielded an x - ray spectrum .",
    "the combined @xmath24 first - order dispersed meg and heg spectra were extracted and simultaneously fitted to an absorbed power - law @xmath25 gaussian model .",
    "the observed heg count spectrum is shown in figure  3 .",
    "very few counts were detected below 4 kev due to the large hydrogen column density of @xmath26 @xmath18 found by fitting the absorption model to the spectra .",
    "the power - law index and normalization are poorly determined due to the limited energy range available for fitting ( 3.59.0 kev ) .",
    "an fe k@xmath1 emission line is clearly detected at 6.4 kev , with flux @xmath27 photon @xmath18 s@xmath13 and equivalent width @xmath28111  ev ( we do not quote formal uncertainties , as the line strength is poorly constrained due to the large uncertainty    = 8.5 cm    in the continuum level ) . additionally , we detect the fe k photoelectric absorption edge near 7.1  kev .",
    "based on the strength of this edge , we estimate an optical depth @xmath29 which implies an even higher hydrogen column density of @xmath30 @xmath18 for the solar abundance values of wilms , allen , & mccray ( 2000 ) . however , given the limited statistics of our short observation , this discrepancy is not serious . the total observed flux ( which is not sensitive to the detailed spectral model ) was @xmath31 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath13 ( 210 kev ) . for photon index @xmath32 ,",
    "this corresponds to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath33 erg  @xmath18  s@xmath13 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "we have precisely measured the x - ray position of oao  1657@xmath34 and have identified its infrared counterpart . based on the x - ray pulsar s orbital parameters and the duration of the x - ray eclipse , chakrabarty et al .",
    "( 1993 ) deduced that the mass donor in this binary has a mass of 1418  @xmath35 and a radius of 2532  @xmath36 , corresponding to a b06 supergiant .",
    "they additionally estimated that the source distance is @xmath37  kpc using the pulsar s accretion torque behavior .",
    "we can compare these predictions with the observed properties of the counterpart .",
    "the intrinsic infrared colors of a b06 supergiant are @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( whittet & van breda 1980 ) . using the interstellar reddening relation of rieke & lebofsky ( 1985 ) ,",
    "the observed colors imply a very large reddening of @xmath10 .",
    "we can also estimate the source distance .",
    "for the inferred mass and radius range , the companion should have a luminosity of @xmath40 and a temperature of @xmath41 ( maeder & meynet 1989 ) . applying the appropriate bolometric corrections ( e.g. , drilling & landolt 2000 ) ,",
    "the expected absolute visual magnitude of the star is @xmath42 . from the intrinsic b supergiant color @xmath43 ( whittet & van breda 1980 ) and our observed @xmath44 magnitude",
    ", we thus derive a source distance of @xmath45  kpc , somewhat closer than estimated from the x - ray pulsar s spin - up rate .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath23 magnitudes yield very similar distance values .",
    "the observed optical limits are also consistent with our derived reddening and distance .    thus , we conclude that the photometric properties of the infrared counterpart are consistent with the b supergiant companion predicted by chakrabarty et al .",
    "we note , however , that the infrared photometry alone can not reliably provide a spectral classifiction for the companion , since the reddening and spectral type are degenerate on an infrared color - color diagram .",
    "however , infrared spectroscopy can provide an accurate spectral classification of the counterpart ( hanson , conti , & rieke 1996 ; blum et al .",
    "1997 ; wallace et al .",
    "2000 ) and should eventually allow a radial velocity curve to be measured .",
    "this        our x - ray spectral measurements indicate that oao  1657@xmath0415 is extremely absorbed . however , though the optical extinction is also large , it is an order of magnitude smaller than would be inferred from the usual galactic ratio of @xmath47  @xmath18  mag@xmath13 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "this probably indicates that most of the x - ray absorption is by gas local to the binary , presumably fed by the companion s stellar wind , and that this gas has a very low dust content ( as expected for a b  star wind ) .",
    "the same phenomenon has been observed in the well - known wind - fed x - ray pulsar vela  x-1 ( sako et al . 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , oao  1657@xmath0415 and vela x-1 ( @xmath48 kpc ) are very similar in most respects .",
    "both pulsars are in eclipsing high - mass x - ray binaries containing a b supergiant companion , have similar orbital parameters , are accreting from their companion s stellar wind , and have similar x - ray luminosities ( for our derived distance , the 210  kev luminosity of oao 1657@xmath0415 is @xmath12 erg  s@xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , we expect that oao  1657@xmath0415 should be a good candidate for studying the ionized stellar wind of the b  supergiant with x - ray line spectroscopy , as has been done with vela x-1 ( sako et al .",
