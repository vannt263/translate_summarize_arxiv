    "over 1,200 brown dwarfs have been cataloged since the first unambiguous discovery less than twenty years ago @xcite . as a result",
    ", two new spectral types , l and t , have been created @xcite to categorize these ultracool objects , and recent discoveries have identified the first brown dwarfs cooler than 400 k @xcite , spawning the creation of the y spectral type .",
    "the main drivers of brown dwarf discoveries have been large - area digital surveys such as the deep near infrared survey of the southern sky ( denis , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; * ? ? ?",
    "photometric searches using these surveys combined with spectroscopic follow - up have identified most of the known field brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recently , the  3@xmath5 survey ( ps1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ; pi mcmahon , cambridge , uk ) have pushed brown dwarf searches to greater distances and cooler temperatures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite the overall success of past searches , it is expected that previous work has been less complete for l / t transition dwarfs ( spectral types @xmath6l6t5 ) because these objects are optically faint and have near - infrared colors that are difficult to distinguish from m and early - l dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "past searches sensitive to l / t objects have also focused on modest areas of the sky .",
    "the most successful searches so far have been those of @xcite , who searched over 3,500  deg@xmath0 using sdss photometry ( optical @xmath7 bands ) to find 47 l6t5 dwarfs ; @xcite and @xcite , who cross - matched sdss dr1 ( 2,099 deg@xmath0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with 2mass ( near - ir ) photometry to identify 10 l6t5 dwarfs ( many of which showed spectral indications of binarity ) ; and @xcite , who searched 495  deg@xmath0 in ukidss and sdss to find 15 l6t5 dwarfs .",
    "* hereinafter d11 ) and @xcite ( 2011a ; 2013 , in prep ) have combined  and 2mass photometry with proper motion to search three - quarters of the sky for t dwarfs . to date , however , there has been no large - area search specifically targeting nearby , bright l / t transition dwarfs .    because of this slow progress in identifying the local l / t population , we do not yet have a well - constrained substellar mass function for the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , recent work indicates that the local space density has a minimum at the l / t transition ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a natural explanation is that the l / t transition spans a fairly narrow temperature range ( @xmath8  k ) compared to l0l5 dwarfs ( @xmath9  k ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , brown dwarfs cool as they age and evolve to later spectral types , resulting in a growing accumulation of late - t and y dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculate errors of @xmath10 and @xmath11 for their estimates of the space density of l7t0.5 and t1t4.5 dwarfs , respectively",
    ". a larger sample of l / t objects will improve these estimates , allowing more accurate assessments of the local ultracool imf .",
    "l / t transition dwarfs are of further interest because their spectral features indicate significant variations in surface gravity , metallicity , and/or atmospheric clouds ( @xcite and references therein ) . in particular ,",
    "many changes in these spectral features are thought to arise from the depletion of condensate clouds as brown dwarfs cool ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making l / t transition dwarfs ideal for case studies of cloud formation and gas chemistry in ultracool atmospheres .",
    "one notable example is the @xmath12  mag @xmath3-band brightening across the l / t transition as thick clouds dissipate to reveal lower , warmer layers of the photosphere , observed in isolated objects @xcite as well as the components of l / t binaries @xcite .",
    "another likely consequence of evolving and thinning clouds is photometric variability .",
    "optical variability is known to be common in l dwarfs @xcite and is typically periodic on timescales of several hours , consistent with rotation periods of brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "however , detection of infrared variability has proven to be much more elusive ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first unambiguous detections of near - ir photometric variability in t dwarfs were in simp j013656.57 + 093347.3 ( t2.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter simp  0136 + 0933 ) and 2mass  j21392676 + 0220226 ( t1.5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter 2mass  2139 + 0220 ) .",
    "notably , both of these objects are members of the l / t transition . @xcite",
    "have subsequently detected @xmath3- and @xmath13-band spectral variability in these objects .",
    "@xcite discovered multiband infrared sinusoidal variability in the t6.5 dwarf 2mass 2228@xmath144310 , along with a wavelength dependence of the variability phase , indicative of vertical cloud structure .",
    "most recently , @xcite identified photometric @xmath3-band variability in two mid - l dwarfs and @xmath15-band variability in a t8 dwarf , while also confirming the @xmath3-band variability of 2mass  2139 + 0220 .",
    "these observations collectively suggest that variability is a normal feature of ultracool dwarfs .",
    "@xcite estimate a variability fraction of @xmath16 , and surprisingly find no strong evidence of a greater frequency for l / t transition objects .",
    "any search for brown dwarfs , especially those in the l / t transition , must also account for binaries .",
    "l+t binaries can have colors and composite spectra that mimic those of single l / t transition dwarfs @xcite and can exaggerate the amplitude of the @xmath3-band brightening @xcite .",
    "components of binary systems are valuable benchmarks , as they are coeval , equidistant , and have common metallicities .",
    "they are especially valuable in the l / t transition , where they can help to set tight constraints on the observed atmospheric transitions @xcite . compared to their stellar analogs , field",
    "brown dwarf binaries tend to have smaller separations @xcite and mass ratios closer to unity @xcite .",
    "this enables determination of their orbits and dynamical masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which breaks the mass / age degeneracy that plagues field brown dwarf analysis .    to increase the census of l / t transition dwarfs , we have begun a search using ps1 and _ wise _ , leveraging the combined data of these optical and mid - infrared surveys",
    "in order to construct a well - defined sample of l / t transition dwarfs , we have limited our search to candidates within 25 parsecs of the sun , based on their photometric distances .",
    "several past projects , including the gliese catalog @xcite and the pmsu m dwarf survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , have searched this same volume of space for stars , so our project is well - matched to previous efforts .",
    "our search will address a known deficiency in the solar neighborhood census , significantly improve the constraints on the local substellar mass and luminosity functions , and identify a well - defined , volume - limited sample of late l and early t dwarfs that can be used to better understand the evolution of brown dwarfs through the l / t transition .    in this paper",
    ", we present the first results of our ongoing search , namely the discovery of seven l / t transition dwarfs within 15  pc .",
    "three objects are entirely new discoveries .",

    "we discuss the properties of specific discoveries in section  [ discuss ] , and summarize our findings in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we identified candidate l / t dwarfs through a series of quality , color , and magnitude cuts applied to our merged ps1+_wise _",
    "database , followed by visual inspection of ps1 , 2mass , and _ wise _  images .",
    "we then obtained and typed spectra of candidates using standard procedures described in section  [ obser ] .    the ps1 @xmath17 survey ( chambers et al .",

    "we merged all ps1 detections through january 2012 with the _ wise_all - sky catalog using a @xmath28 matching radius .",

    "also eliminates transient objects ( e.g. , asteroids ) in regions the surveys have only covered once .",
    "candidates were selected from the full three - quarters of sky covered by the merged database .    to extract candidate l / t transition dwarfs from our ps1+_wise _  database , we applied the following quality - of - detection criteria ( items shown in parentheses refer to flags within the database ) :    1 .   detected in at least two separate @xmath29  frames ( @xmath30 ) , to reject transients .",

    "@xmath20 and @xmath22 detections are unlikely to be variable ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we thus required that candidates have good detections in @xmath29 , @xmath20 , and @xmath22 , but not necessarily in any other bands .",
    "we then applied the following color criteria , which are illustrated by figures  [ fig.iy.iz][fig.w1w2.yw1 ] :    1 .",
    "no more than one total detection in either @xmath41  or @xmath42  ( @xmath43 ) , unless each band had only a single detection with @xmath44  mag . among known l / t transition dwarfs , none are detected in @xmath41  and only one in @xmath42   the nearby , unusually blue l6 dwarf sdss  j1416 + 1348 @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect previously undiscovered l / t transition dwarfs to be too red to show up in @xmath41  and @xmath42 and this criterion rejects objects that are clearly detected in these bluer bands . 2 .   @xmath45@xmath14@xmath46  @xmath47  mag ( figure  [ fig.iy.iz ] ) , to exclude objects of spectral type mid - l and earlier .",
    "we applied this criterion only when the @xmath45  and @xmath46  photometry for an object met the same quality standards required for @xmath29  detections , i.e. , @xmath48  mag and @xmath49  mag ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) with at least two detections in both @xmath45  and @xmath46  ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 , to reject transient detections ) .",
    "of the l / t transition dwarfs too faint to have been previously discovered in 2mass and sdss , even the brightest are likely to be near the detection limits of @xmath45  and @xmath46 .",

    "many of our candidates were not actually detected in @xmath24 , but _ wise _  reports a lower magnitude limit for all non - detections , so we used the @xmath65  value as an upper limit in those cases . @xcite and m13 used @xmath67  mag for this purpose .",
    "we then applied cuts based on spatial position :    1 .",
    "we rejected all candidates within @xmath68 of the galactic plane .",
    "2 .   to avoid objects in reddened star forming regions , we inspected the ( ra , dec ) positions of candidates within @xmath69 of the galactic plane and rejected those that were clumped in tight groups .",
    "we further rejected all remaining candidates in the highly reddened regions identified by @xcite , unless a candidate had a proper motion measured with @xmath70 ( based on 2mass and ps1 astrometry ) .",
    "we then reviewed the available images for each remaining candidate in all five ps1 filters ( _ g , r , i , z , y _ ) , all three 2mass filters ( _ j , h , k _ ) , and _ wise _",

    "we rejected objects that were clearly artifacts ( e.g. , diffraction spikes or halos ) in one or more bands or non - point sources such as galaxies .",
    "as a final filter , we required objects to have sufficiently red @xmath71 colors to be in the l / t transition .",
    "we cross - matched our candidate list with the 2mass , ukidss dr8 @xcite , and vista dr1 @xcite catalogs , and used @xmath3 magnitudes from those catalogs when available with @xmath72  mag .",
    "the ukidss photometric system uses mko standards @xcite and is described in @xcite .",

    "this cut does permit objects bluer than the @xmath76  mag cut used by d11 , who searched exclusively for t dwarfs .",
    "unlike d11 , we did not apply a @xmath77 cut to our sample .",
    "because of the spectral changes endemic to l / t objects , @xmath29  absolute magnitudes are almost flat across the transition , from about l8 to t3 spectral types",
    ". therefore , choosing a @xmath29-magnitude limit approximately creates a volume - limited sample , with only modest contamination by intrinsically brighter objects that lie beyond the search radius .",
    "for follow - up observations , we chose candidates with @xmath78  mag to search the solar neighborhood for single l / t objects out to 25  pc , acknowledging that our search will also detect unresolved binaries out to larger distances .",
    "we obtained follow - up near - ir imaging of our candidates using wfcam @xcite on the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in queue mode . over five nights spanning 2012",

    "initial spectral typing of candidates was accomplished using spectral indices from @xcite , with spectral types assigned using the polynomial fits from @xcite .",
    "the spectra were then visually compared to near - infrared spectra for l dwarf @xcite and t dwarf spectral standards @xcite for final assignment of spectral types . following the procedure of @xcite , when comparing our candidate spectra with l dwarf standards , we first compared only the @xmath85 m portions of the spectra to evaluate the goodness of fit . if the best match for a candidate was determined to be an l dwarf standard , then we compared the candidate spectrum to that of the standard over @xmath86 m to determine if the candidate was unusually red or blue for its spectral type .",

    "this dimming may be due to the presence of a crescent moon about 6@xmath114 from the standard star during this night s observations . to correct for the dimming",

    "the april spectra also match well the 2012 september 20 spectrum , with only the september 26th sxd spectrum showing a clear difference in flux .",
    "however , in the @xmath2-band , the april spectra all have noticeably lower flux than both of the september spectra .",
    "collectively , our data show significant spectrospcopic variation for pso  j307.6 + 07 in 2012 september , and no variation in 2013 april .",
    "the reason for this apparent contradiction is unclear .",
    "the long - term stability of near - ir spectrospcopic variations in l / t transition dwarfs is not well understood , so it is possible that the 2012 september observations simply occurred during an epoch of variability for pso  j307.6 + 07 , while the 2013 april observations found the object in an epoch of constancy ( or diminished variability ) .",
    "it is also possible that the detected variability is a result of an unrecognized oversight in the observations or data reduction .",
    "we note that the april data were obtained at higher airmass ; care was taken during these observations to ensure the instrument slit was aligned with the parallactic angle , and the standard stars were observed at similar airmasses ( within 0.1 ) .",
    "we note as well that the september 26th spectrum is the only one obtained in sxd ( cross - dispersed ) mode .",
    "we have stitched the different orders together using the standard spextool procedure _ xcombspec _ to create a single spectrum , and it is possible that this procedure has scaled one or more orders to an incorrect flux .",
    "we consider this to be unlikely for three reasons : @xcite showed that order stiching with _ xcombspec _ results in a mean color difference of @xmath115 mag , much smaller than the @xmath116 we detected in pso  j307.6 + 07 ; we used the same stitching procedure to obtain the spectrum for pso  j339.0 + 51 ( figure  [ fig.12 - 014644 ] ) , in which we find no significant variation ; and we see similar spectral variation in pso  j140.2 + 45 , where both spectra were obtained in prism mode .",
    "overall , we can not establish a decisive reason for the difference of the intra - night behavior between our 2012 sept and 2013 april datasets , so we label pso  j307.6 + 07 a candidate spectroscopic variable .",
    "further observations on multiple nights are needed to confirm or reject this object as a near - ir variable .",
    "since our seven discoveries are bright , they are all well detected in 2mass .",
    "we can compare our mko photometry to the 2mass measurements as a simple two - epoch check for near - ir variability over a period of approximately ten years .",
    "( note that we do not use our spex data to synthesize the conversions directly for each object , because the spectra and photometry were all obtained at different epochs . )",

    "we do not have @xmath129 photometry for pso  j339.0 + 51 .",

    "we found evidence for binarity in two of our discoveries , described individually below .",
    "we performed spectral decomposition analysis on these two objects following the method described in section  5.2 of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we used the library of 178 irtf / spex prism spectra presented in b10 to create summed spectra . for each template pairing we determined the scale factors needed to minimize the @xmath130 of the difference with our observed spectrum .",
    "we then examined the resulting best pairing to determine the component spectral types , taking into account factors such as larger than average spectral type uncertainties in the best - match templates and the full range of properties implied when there were multiple matches giving equally good fits .",
    "we estimated the flux ratios in standard near - infrared bandpasses using our @xmath130 values and the weighting scheme described in @xcite .",

    "pso  j103.0 + 41 also lies on the border of the binary regions in three of the b10 index - index plots .",
    "this object is therefore an appealing candidate for high - resolution imaging .",
    "pso  j282.7576 + 59.5858 ( hereinafter pso  j282.7 + 59 ) is not a good match to any of the t  dwarf spectral standards .",
    "its spectral indices average to l8.5 , and our best visual @xmath3-band fit is l9 , but the @xmath13- and @xmath15-band peaks have lower flux than the l9 standard 2mass  j0255@xmath144700 @xcite .",
    "the shape of the @xmath13-band peak is almost flat with a slight increase toward longer wavelengths , a feature more typical of early l - dwarfs ( see figure 10 in * ? ? ?",
    "we tentatively classify pso  j282.7 + 59 as an l9 for a single object ( photometric distance @xmath133  pc ) , but the discordance in its spectral features suggests that we are looking at a blended spectrum .",

    "the spectral indices of pso  j282.7 + 59 do not place it in any of the binary regions of the b10 index - index plots , but b10 noted that their selection process was probably biased against systems with more than two components .",
    "we find the best match for binaries has a template pairing of l7+t4.5 ( figure  [ fig.decomp ] , table  [ tbl.decomp ] ) , at a distance of @xmath134  pc .",
    "all seven of the newly discovered objects are brighter than most known l / t transition dwarfs .",
    "this raises the question of why the objects were not discovered earlier .",
    "one reason is that several of the major surveys used in previous brown dwarf searches covered smaller fractions of the sky than ps1 . of our seven objects ,",
    "only two are in regions covered by sdss ( pso  j103.0 + 41 and pso  j142.2 + 45 ) and only two lie within the ukidss search area ( pso  j007.7921 + 57.8267 and pso  j142.2 + 45 again ) .",
    "another reason is that we have searched close to the galactic plane , using proper motion as well as colors to distinguish brown dwarf candidates from reddened background objects .",
    "three of our seven discoveries have @xmath135 , putting them in crowded regions commonly avoided in previous searches ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "pso  j140.2 + 45 also shows a marginal change in @xmath2-band flux .",
