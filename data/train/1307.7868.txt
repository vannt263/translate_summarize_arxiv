    "the phenomenon of electric conduction in metals and semiconductors has been a prominent research topic ever since the early days of solid - state physics .",
    "the idea that electric currents flowing inside solid materials are effected by the transport of `` small '' charged particles ( `` charge carriers '' ) was first conceived by weber.@xcite following the discovery of the electron by thomson,@xcite weber s idea quickly found its concrete expression in attempts to understand electric ( as well as thermal ) conduction in solids as a manifestation of electron transport .",
    "the basic concept for a theoretical treatment of conduction in terms of the motion of individual carriers was outlined by riecke.@xcite relying to some extent on this concept , drude@xcite formulated his celebrated transport model , which subsequently was refined by lorentz.@xcite in drude s model , the atomistic picture of matter and the kinetic theory of gases are combined to describe conduction in terms of a homogeneous gas of non - interacting , mobile charge carriers in thermodynamic equilibrium , which are assumed to move against a background of spatially fixed , heavy atoms . when an external electric field is applied , the interplay of field - induced acceleration and subsequent thermalizing collisions with the heavy atoms gives rise to a `` drift current '' of the carriers .",
    "the magnitude of this current is determined by the `` mean free path '' , i.e. , the average distance the carriers travel between two collisions . for the drift",
    "current to be a valid concept , the mean free path must be very small as compared with typical dimensions of the sample .",
    "while originally conceived to describe carrier transport in metals , drude s model later on has been frequently used in qualitative , or semi - quantitative , analyses of transport properties of semiconductors as well .    to overcome the shortcomings of drude s model in the quantitative description of carrier transport in semiconductors , particularly in inhomogeneously doped systems , the drift current was supplemented with a diffusion current,@xcite whereby",
    "drude s model has been extended to the `` drift - diffusion model '' of transport .",
    "the latter model , while representing a substantial improvement over drude s model and serving as a benchmark of semiclassical transport theories even in modern times , is again valid in the range of very small carrier mean free paths only . in the opposite case of very large mean free paths , carrier transport in semiconductors can be described in terms of the ballistic ( `` thermionic '' ) model,@xcite in which carriers thermally emitted at the ends of a sample are assumed to traverse it without collisions with the background atoms .    until recently",
    ", no systematic attempts had been made to bridge the gap between the limiting cases of the drift - diffusion and ballistic descriptions within a unified approach . in view of this situation",
    ", we set out to develop the `` thermoballistic approach''@xcite to carrier transport in semiconductors .",
    "apart from perceiving the challenge to fill a long - standing gap in the theory of carrier transport in semiconductors , we found that recent progress in device physics , spintronics , and photovoltaics called for an extension of the theoretical framework hitherto available for analyzing experimental data in these fields .",
    "the physical concept underlying the thermoballistic approach rests on a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into `` ballistic transport intervals '' . here , `` random '' implies ( i ) an arbitrary number of intervals and ( ii ) arbitrary positions of the end - points , and thus arbitrary lengths , of the intervals .",
    "[ the drift - diffusion model may be viewed as implying a partitioning of the sample length into infinitesimally short ballistic intervals ;  in the ballistic transport model , on the other hand , the sample length constitutes a single ballistic interval . ]",
    "an individual partition defines what we call a `` ballistic configuration '' .",
    "the points linking adjacent intervals in a ballistic configuration are assumed to be points of local thermodynamic equilibrium characterized by a local chemical potential .",
    "any such point acts both as a source of , and a sink for , carriers .",
    "that is , on the one hand , carriers are thermally emitted there , with a velocity distribution determined by the local temperature ;  subsequent to their emission , the carriers are ballistically transmitted across either interval to the left and right , facing , in general , potential energy barriers arising from the internal and external potentials inside the sample . on the other hand , carriers emitted at the two equilibrium points neighboring the point under consideration on either side and transmitted to it are `` absorbed '' there , i.e. , they return to thermodynamic equilibrium instantaneously .",
    "this equilibration is assumed to result from collisions of the carriers with spatially fixed scattering centers ( `` impurities '' ) randomly distributed over the sample , a view adopted from drude s transport model .    in the manner by which the ballistic intervals have been introduced ,",
    "the lengths of these intervals are stochastic variables , with associated probabilities given by the probabilities for carriers to traverse an interval without impurity scattering .",
    "these probabilities are governed by the carrier mean free path , which is allowed to have arbitrary magnitude . by averaging the ( in general , spin - dependent ) carrier currents in the individual ballistic intervals over all ballistic configurations , a position - dependent total ( i.e.",
    ", spin - summed ) thermoballistic current as well as a thermoballistic spin - polarized current are derived .",
    "these currents , in conjunction with the associated ballistic densities , represent the key elements of the thermoballistic approach .",
    "they form the point of departure for the calculation of the spin - resolved equilibrium chemical potentials . from the latter functions , in turn ,",
    "transport quantities , like the current - voltage characteristic , the magnetoresistance , and ( position - dependent ) current and density spin polarizations , are obtained in terms of the potential energy profile , the mean free path , the ballistic spin relaxation length , and other parameters characterizing the sample .    the present article is devoted to a comprehensive exposition of the physical concept underlying the thermoballistic approach and its detailed implementation .",
    "we begin by describing a prototype model of thermoballistic transport ( the `` prototype model '' , for short ) .",
    "this model introduces averaging over ballistic configurations as the constitutive element of the thermoballistic concept .",
    "it is based on the simplifying assumption that the carrier current is conserved across the points of local thermodynamic equilibrium linking the ballistic transport intervals .",
    "this assumption allows the derivation of an explicit , transparent expression for the current - voltage characteristic , as well as the construction of a local chemical potential in a heuristic form . after describing the prototype model",
    ", we present a general formulation of the thermoballistic concept proper , which makes use of a local chemical potential as the essential dynamical quantity , and takes into account arbitrarily shaped , spin - split potential energy profiles as well as spin relaxation during ballistic carrier motion .    throughout this article ,",
    "the formulation deviates in many respects from that in our original publications .",
    "apart from correcting flaws and inconsistencies , we introduce modifications and extensions of the formalism that make it more transparent and more comprehensible . aiming at a self - contained , unified presentation , we will develop the elements of the thermoballistic concept in considerable detail .",
    "this includes a recollection of early attempts to describe charge carrier transport in semiconductors and , at one place or another , the coherent recapitulation of background material which otherwise can be found only scattered over textbooks .",
    "while the thermoballistic approach , in its most general form , would allow a consistent treatment of three - dimensional , bipolar carrier transport in semiconducting systems , we confine ourselves here to the case of one - dimensional , unipolar transport throughout . to be specific , we consider electron transport in the conduction band of n - doped systems , with the understanding that all results for hole transport in the valence band of p - doped systems can be obtained by transcribing the results for electron transport in an obvious way .",
    "in implementing the thermoballistic approach , we aim at carrying the development to the point where we obtain explicit equations from which the relevant physical quantities can be calculated .",
    "we do not enter here into applications requiring numerical calculations .",
    "pertinent results presented in our previous publications will be briefly mentioned at various places in this article .",

    "we present an account of drude s transport model and the standard drift - diffusion and ballistic models . in sec .",

    "the drift - diffusion model is an extension of the transport model of drude , so that we begin here with an account of the latter .",
    "drude s model is far from being able to describe transport properties of semiconductors quantitatively ;  nevertheless , its exposition provides us with the opportunity to introduce and discuss the basic notions on which classical and semiclassical transport theories rely , and which will appear ubiquitously throughout this article .      in the transport model of drude,@xcite",

    "the basic ingredients of the ( semiclassical ) thermoballistic concept are the ballistic carrier currents and densities which are constructed within the following framework .",
    "( i ) thermal emission of carriers occurs at points of local thermodynamic equilibrium randomly distributed over the sample .",
    "( ii ) the equilibrium points link `` ballistic transport intervals '' across which the emitted carriers move ballistically under the influence of potential energy profiles arising from internal and external electrostatic potentials . during their ballistic motion ,",
    "the carriers undergo spin relaxation controlled by a ballistic spin relaxation length @xmath633 .",
    "( iii ) at the end - points of the ballistic intervals , instantaneous `` point - like '' thermalization ( `` absorption '' ) of the carriers takes place . here",
    ", we invoke the picture of `` reflectionless contacts''@xcite , according to which the ballistic carriers that enter a contact ( representing a `` bath '' with an effectively infinite number of transverse modes ) are completely absorbed there , after having been emitted from a similar contact at the opposite end of the sample . in the thermoballistic concept ,",
    "the emission and absorption of carriers are treated in this way at _ all _ points of local thermodynamic equilibrium inside the sample . at these points ,",
    "the absorption of carriers into the bath is complete ( `` reflectionless '' ) , but at the same instant carriers are emitted out of the bath into the ballistic intervals on either side.the opposing collision - free currents emitted at either end into the ballistic interval combine to form a _ net ballistic current _ inside the interval , with an associated _ joint ballistic density_.    the random distribution of points of local thermodynamic equilibrium is mirrored in a random partitioning of the length of the sample into ballistic intervals , where each partition defines a `` ballistic configuration '' , a central notion of the concept .",
    "the ballistic carrier currents and densities in these configurations are assembled to form the corresponding _ thermoballistic currents and densities_. these are constructed , at a reference position @xmath37 located arbitrarily inside the sample , by performing weighted summations , with weights controlled by a momentum relaxation length @xmath7 , over the net ballistic currents and joint ballistic densities in all ballistic intervals containing the point @xmath37 .",
    "the thermoballistic currents and densities constitute the key element of the thermoballistic concept .",
    "the physical content of the thermoballistic transport mechanism can be exhibited by analyzing the underlying formalism with regard to the intertwined effects of thermal electron emission and ballistic motion .",
    "let us consider expressions ( [ eq : ball004jvx])([eq : netbal02xy ] ) for the net ballistic currents and joint ballistic densities , which are essentially composed of two factors each .",
    "on the one hand , they contain the nonlocal barrier factors @xmath844 and @xmath845 in the expressions for the total and persistent spin - polarized currents and the relaxing spin - polarized current , respectively , and the factors @xmath846 and @xmath847 in the analogous expressions for the densities .",
    "these factors describe the collision - free motion of the electrons across the ballistic interval @xmath313 $ ] , which is essentially determined by the potential energy profiles @xmath848 inside the interval .",
    "they represent the _ ballistic attribute _ of thermoballistic transport . the factors in brackets , on the other hand , contain terms depending on the average chemical potentials @xmath545 , @xmath849 and the spin accumulation functions @xmath504 , @xmath505 , which are directly related to the spin - resolved chemical potentials @xmath850 , @xmath851 at the end - points @xmath512 of the ballistic interval . these factors , which describe the thermal emission ( `` thermal activation '' ) of the ballistic currents at the points of local thermodynamic equilibrium at @xmath417 and @xmath418 , respectively , represent the _ thermal attribute _ of thermoballistic transport . the term in brackets is the `` activation term '' .",
    "[ the joint appearance of ballistic and thermal attributes shows that the term `` thermoballistic '' indeed provides an appropriate characterization of our approach . ]    the contributions of the ballistic currents and densities ( [ eq : ball004jvx])([eq : netbal02xy ] ) , summarily denoted by @xmath710 , to the corresponding thermoballistic currents and densities @xmath689 are to be read from eq .",

    ", when @xmath725 and there is no point of local thermodynamic equilibrium inside the sample , the transport is purely ballistic between the end - points @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and only the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",

    "this current is essentially given in terms of equilibrium quantities , a property that characterizes the _ drift - diffusion limit_. expression ( [ eq : syn02 ] ) has the form of the current in the standard drift - diffusion approach [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : drude006f ] ) and ( [ eq : diff001 ] ) ] , @xmath857 where @xmath61 is the electron mobility given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ballim20a ] ) , and @xmath731 the equilibrium electron density given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ball004jum ] ) . in that approach ,",
    "the momentum relaxation length @xmath7 is nonzero ( so that @xmath61 remains nonzero ) , but small compared with the length scales over which the other parameters vary appreciably .",
    "the activation term reduces to a derivative , and the relation between the total thermoballistic current and the average chemical potential becomes a local one .",
    "the principal merit of the thermoballistic concept is that it allows to establish a consistent and transparent formalism for bridging , within the semiclassical approximation , the gap between the standard drift - diffusion and ballistic descriptions of charge carrier transport in semiconductors . while incorporating basic features of these descriptions , the thermoballistic concept consistently unifies and generalizes them by introducing random partitionings of the sample length into ballistic configurations .",
    "the concept is transparent in a twofold way .",
    "first , as shown above , a lucid interpretation of its physical content can be given in terms of ballistic and thermal attributes .",
    "second , owing to its semiclassical character,@xcite the concept allows the effects of the different parameters describing a semiconducting system to be clearly distinguished . in the implementation of this concept , explicit equations for various transport quantities",
    "can be derived , and simple solutions can be obtained in important special cases . the merit of transparency of the thermoballistic concept carries with it some simplifications and weak points which , however , in many cases can be remedied , albeit at the cost of increased complexity :  they are not detrimental to the concept as a whole .",
    "while the formulation of the full thermoballistic concept given here describes semiclassical transport in nondegenerate semiconducting systems , we have demonstrated within the prototype model how effects of electron tunneling and degeneracy can be taken into account .",
    "quantum interference effects in the electron motion are not treated explicitly , but they may be assumed to be implicitly incorporated via an extended interpretation of the mean free path ( or momentum relaxation length ) @xmath7 , which from the outset has been taken as a phenomenological parameter . by treating it formally as the average distance that the carriers travel without collision between points of _ complete _ thermodynamic equilibrium , as in the relaxation time approximation,@xcite it simulates the effects of incomplete equilibration due to elastic or inelastic impurity scattering , of dimensionality , and , in the extreme , of quantal phase correlations .",
    "indeed , in this work the momentum relaxation length @xmath7 is the determining parameter in which a great diversity of detail is subsumed .",
    "it is introduced as a constant , so it must include in an average way the effect of spatial variations in the internal and external parameters characterizing the semiconducting system;in particular , this constant is chosen to be independent of the potential energy profile , to which , however , it should be related in a self - consistent way . moreover , the choice of the momentum relaxation length @xmath7 , rather than the relaxation time @xmath8 , is also merely one of convenience for the stationary treatment in this work .",
    "we may work with position - dependent momentum relaxation lengths , but this would increase the complexity of the formalism and obscure the general line of argument .",
    "the spin relaxation mechanism in terms of the ballistic spin relaxation length @xmath633 is again a phenomenological one , having certain similarities with the dyakonov - perel mechanism.@xcite we assume spin relaxation to occur only during the ballistic electron motion ;  however , simultaneous spin and momentum relaxation could be taken into account by introducing additional terms in the spin balace equation .    in principle , the thermoballistic concept allows a fully three - dimensional treatment of bipolar carrier transport to be implemented .",
    "however , in the present paper , in order to keep the formalism manageable , we work within a narrowed framework .",
    "first , we confine ourselves to unipolar transport , dealing specifically with electron transport in a spin - split conduction band .",
    "second , we consider three - dimensional `` plane - parallel '' samples whose parameters ( in particular , the average density of the scattering centers associated with impurities ) do not vary in the directions perpendicular to the transport direction ( the @xmath37-direction ) .",
    "nevertheless , electron transport in this kind of sample depends on the number of dimensions , @xmath17 , via `` no - scattering probabilities '' @xmath858 [ see sec .",

    "[ sec : probappr ] ) .",
    "having presented , in the preceding section , the concept underlying the thermoballistic approach , we now turn to the implementation of this concept .",
    "we begin by establishing the physical conditions from which the algorithms for calculating the dynamical functions , _ viz . _ , the average chemical potential @xmath503 [ via the mean spin function @xmath507 ] and the spin accumulation function @xmath506 , are developed .",

    "the implementation of the prototype model results in a current - voltage characteristic containing a reduced resistance , which can be expressed explicitly in terms of the parameters of the semiconducting system .    in the full thermoballistic concept , current conservation across the equilibrium points is abandoned , and position - dependent , total and spin - polarized thermoballistic currents and densities are introduced in terms of an average chemical - potential function and a spin accumulation function related to the spin splitting of the chemical potential .",
    "the algorithms for determining these dynamical functions follow from two physical conditions .",
    "first , the average of the total thermoballistic current over the length of the semiconducting sample ( as well as over the range between either end and an arbitrary point of local thermodynamic equilibrium ) is required to equal the conserved physical current , whereby one is able to set up a scheme for obtaining the average chemical potential .",
    "the explicit calculation of this function is implemented in terms of resistance functions , for which volterra - type integral equations are derived .",
    "second , spin relaxation is assumed to act only inside the ballistic transport intervals . as a result , the thermoballistic spin - polarized current and density",
    "are connected by a spin balance equation , from which one obtains an inhomogeneous fredholm - type integral equation for the spin accumulation function . in the general case of",
    "arbitrarily shaped potential energy profiles , considerable numerical effort is needed for solving the integral equations for the resistance functions and the spin accumulation function . in a number of important special cases , however , these equations reduce to a form which greatly facilitates their solution .",
    "examples are the equations for the resistance functions when the spin splitting of the band edge profile is independent of position , or the equation for the spin accumulation function for a homogeneous sample in an external electric field . in the latter case",
    ", the integral equation can be converted into an easily tractable second - order differential equation . for homogeneous semiconductors at zero bias , the solutions of the equations for the dynamical functions can be obtained in closed form throughout .    for the purpose of demonstrating the potentialities of the thermoballistic approach in present - day semiconductor and spintronics research , we have summarized in this article the treatment of a number of specific examples .",
    "the prototype model is employed to describe electron transport across potential energy profiles exhibiting an arbitrary number of barriers , where effects of tunneling and degeneracy are included .",
    "this approach proves to be of particular relevance to the description of grain boundary effects in electron transport in polycrystalline semiconductors and has already been applied with promising results in the analysis of experimental data . the full thermoballistic approach is used in the treatment of spin - polarized transport in heterostructures . for the prototype problem of semiconductor spintronics , _ viz .",
    "_ , the injection of spin polarization from ferromagnetic contacts into a semiconducting sample , the thermoballistic description extends the standard drift - diffusion description so as to allow for arbitrary values of the momentum relaxation length .",
    "the same holds for transport in heterostructures composed of layers of diluted magnetic and nonmagnetic semiconductors at zero bias , where the position dependence of the current spin polarization as well as the magnetoresistance are obtained in closed form .    in our previous publications",
    ", we have presented results of explicit calculations for a variety of specific cases .",
    "these calculations were mostly of exploratory character , with the aim to reveal qualitative trends in the parameter dependence of the relevant transport properties . in future",
    "work , emphasis should be placed on the application of the thermoballistic approach in quantitative studies , as demanded for the analysis of specific experimental results . for these studies to become successful ,",
    "the careful evaluation of the potential energy profiles is prerequisite , and advanced numerical techniques for solving the integral equations for the dynamical functions are to be employed . with these goals",
    "achieved , the thermoballistic approach will certainly prove useful as a practical tool , beyond its basic theoretical relevance as the bridge between the drift - diffusion and ballistic descriptions of charge carrier transport in semiconductors .",
    "we are indebted to the board of directors and the staff of the helmholtz - zentrum berlin fr materialien und energie for generously granting access to its premises and facilities beyond the date of our retirement , thereby allowing us to continue and complete our research work on charge carrier transport in semiconductors .",
