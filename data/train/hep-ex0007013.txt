    "in deep - inelastic lepton - proton scattering processes , a small excess of positively charged leading particles is expected owing to the valence quark structure of the proton .",
    "an interaction involving a valence @xmath2 quark is 8 times more likely than that involving a valence @xmath3 quark .",
    "no excess is expected from sea quark or gluon initiated interactions . + since leading hadrons ",
    "remember  the charge of the struck quark , this gives the experimentalist a probe to investigate the partonic structure of the proton . at hera",
    "this method could be used to perform such studies over several orders of magnitude in @xmath0 and @xmath1 and will complement existing studies based on jet measurements and other hadronic final state variables[1][2 ] .      to define an event charge ,",
    "let us first determine a reference direction on which to project momenta .",
    "if the dis scattering were simply an elastic deflection of a quark by a positron , this direction would simply be the final quark direction .",
    "but we know that the reaction is more complicated , involving gluons or even more than one quark ( boson - gluon - fusion bgf ) . nevertheless , from the deflected positron parameters ( which , for simulated events are known without error ) we define the hadronic axis by assuming the scattering to be elastic , and using the deflected positron information .",
    "+ alternative methods could be to use event shape information , such as the thrust axis , to define the hadronic system .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this paper and is not considered here .",
    "+ event charge studies have already been made in deep inelastic scattering [ 3 ] and in e+e- interactions at lep[4 ] .",
    "+ for this paper , the following definition of event charge is used : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the particle charge ( -1 or + 1 ) and @xmath6 is the projected momentum on the hadronic axis .the sums run over @xmath7 all particles which have positive @xmath6 s ; q is between -1 and + 1 .",
    "this was used by aleph in [ 4 ] .",
    "+      for this study , the leading particle is defined as the charged hadron which has the largest momentum projected onto the hadronic axis .",
    "if the experimentally measurable @xmath9 or @xmath10 were to be the leading particle then the event is discarded .",
    "the positive excess @xmath8 is defined as the ratio between the number of leading particles which are positively signed @xmath11 over those which are negatively signed @xmath12 : @xmath13 .      in this section",
    ", we will use @xmath8 to explain the relation of the positive mean event charge to interactions involving the proton valence quarks .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath8 can be related to two quantities :    * the positive excess at the quark level , given by the ratio @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the numbers of those events where the interaction has given a leading u-,d-,s-,@xmath23-,@xmath24- , respectively @xmath25-quark . *",
    "the probability that the charge of the initial quark and the one of the leading particle are the same . here",
    "@xmath26 should be the same irrespective of the quark flavour .",
    "this will later be shown a flawed assumption , but we can take mean values .",
    "then the dependence of @xmath27 upon @xmath28 and @xmath26 is described by the formula : @xmath29    the probability @xmath26 , averaged on different flavours , is given by qcd based models , and is found to be of the order of 0.6 to 0.7 .",
    "+ the valence quark interactions from the proton are 8 times more likely to be initiated by an @xmath2 quark than by a @xmath3 quark .",
    "hence , for valence quarks , more @xmath30 and @xmath31 than @xmath32 and @xmath33 should be detected as leading particles .",
    "+ for example , in the very high @xmath0 region , the valence quark interactions will dominate the @xmath34 cross - section .",
    "therefore , @xmath28 is equal to 8 , and @xmath8 is expected to be 1.39 for @xmath35 .",
    "+ to quantify this , we take @xmath36 and @xmath37 as the yields of positive and negative quarks struck by the photon , respectively , and produced by some process @xmath38 . to simplify ,",
    "we could consider only three different processes @xmath38 : boson gluon fusion ( bgf ) , scattering on a sea quark ( sea ) or scattering on valence quarks ( v ) . + here",
    ", we do not distinguish between elastic @xmath39 diffusion and qcd compton reactions , where one gluon is added : @xmath40 .",
    "it has been shown with lepto , that so far as the event charge is concerned , they are equivalent .",
    "this can be simply understood : in qcd compton events , the gluon is often weaker than the final quark q , and also it has to break down into two quarks ( plus gluons ) .",
    "the chance that one out of these two quarks has a larger energy than q is very limited ; so the leading particle will generally stay related to the q quark . +",
    "the positive excess at the quark level is thus : @xmath41 .",
    "+ for sea quarks and quarks emitted through bgf , the number of quarks is identical to the number of their antiquarks , we can state : + @xmath42 + then : @xmath43",
    ". let @xmath44 and @xmath45 , so that @xmath46 . as was quoted above , the value of r should be 8 ( naively ) , so that : @xmath47 is nearly equal to @xmath48 .",
    "we see then that the positive excess at the quark level is a measure of the ratio of yield by valence quarks over yield by other processes .",
    "+ we access to it by measuring the mean event charge , but the probability @xmath49 introduced above should be known , using qcd based models .",
    "we can perform some tests on these qcd based models , mainly on various fragmentation properties [ 5 ] and leading particle studies ( mainly @xmath50 and @xmath10 [ 6 ] ) . after determining the mean event charge as a function of x and @xmath1 , we can not have direct values of @xmath51 but we may compare the reconstructed charges with those predicted by qcd based models .",
    "the leading particle plays a major role in determination of the mean charge , and so we will perform our kinematic cuts on the leading particle parameters . in the following , we will cut all events having a leading particle angle less than 0.7 rad ( where the angle is defined with respect to the initial proton direction ) or larger than @xmath52 rad . in the forward direction , we then avoid particles coming from the proton remnant . in both directions , we have to reserve some room for the next to leading ( n.t.l . ) and other particles , so that the event charge is well evaluated . +",
    "another cut on all tracks has been imposed by experimental conditions at h1 : to avoid beam gas background , to which the mean value of the event charge q is very sensitive , we require all tracks to have a transverse momentum larger than 0.6 gev / c . + the parameter @xmath53 was also used to select events where the leading particle  remembers  better the initial quark flavour .",
    "typically , it was required to be larger than 0.15 .",
    "there exists different qcd based models , for which we take the following versions : lepto(6.5)[7 ] , ariadne(410)[8 ] , rapgap(2.0)[9 ] , and herwig(5.9008)[10 ] .",
    "lepto , ariadne , and rapgap have the same hadronisation program , jetset [ 11 ] .",
    "+ for each of these four qcd based models , we have generated 2 million events in the range @xmath54 gev@xmath55 .",
    "the corresponding luminosity is @xmath56 pb@xmath57 , which is below what is now available at hera .",
    "the grv [ 12 ] parton density was used for all . for ariadne and rapgap ,",
    "the pomeron was off .",
    "for lepto , the qcd effects were on .",
    "we have made comparisons of different qcd based models for the following fragmentation parameters :    * charge correlations in the system of the 2 or 3 leading particles ; * projected momentum of the leading particle on the hadronic direction ; * @xmath58 , rapidity and momentum ratio correlations of the leading and the struck quark ; * @xmath58 , rapidity and charge correlations of the leading and n.t.l .",
    "particles ; * @xmath59 , @xmath10 as leading particles ; * @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 production in the system of the leading and next to leading particles .    we show here",
    "charge correlations in the system of the 2 or 3 leading particles . however , the other parameters are shown in the internet version of this note . + all these quantities can be experimentally measured , and comparison to m.cs provides a good test of hadronisation programs.the detailed results are shown in the extended version ( on the web ) . generally , there is a good agreement between different qcd based models .",
    "the leading and next to leading particles may either have opposite charges , which is foreseen by the naive model of quark hadronisation , or same charges , which is also foreseen but in less frequent cases . in the following , when we write a pair of signs , the first is for the leading , the second for the n.t.l .. in the next figure 4 different ratios are shown , for channels 1 to 4 :    * @xmath63 : this is the negative excess of the n.t.l .",
    "naively , this should be a little larger than 1 , and it is very close to 1 for all qcd based models . *",
    "@xmath64 : this is the positive excess for leading and n.t.l . when both have the same charge .",
    "* @xmath65 : positive excess for opposite charge leading and n.t.l , lower than the preceding one . *",
    "@xmath66 : this is the positive excess when the three first particles carry the same sign .     and for @xmath67.,width=566,height=453 ]    the agreement between the three jetset qcd based models and on the other hand herwig is rather poor .",
    "+ in the next figure , we show 3 other ratios :    * @xmath68 for the leading and the n.t.l .. it should be much larger than 1 , and it is of the order of 2 . * @xmath69 for the leading and the next to next to leading ( n.t.n.t.l . ) .",
    "naively , this would be expected to be less than 1 but is larger than 1 .",
    "this is due to the fact that events with signs ( + + + ) or ( - - - ) are very seldom , as is shown in the next channel . * @xmath70 .",
    "+ we see that the value of this ratio is between 3 to 4 : it is very seldom that the three first particles carry the same sign .     and for @xmath71,width=566,height=453 ]",
    "as was written in the introduction , the event charge q depends upon two quantities : the mean probability @xmath26 that the initial quark charge and that of the leading particle are the same and @xmath28 : the positive excess at the quark level . before presenting the results on the event charge",
    ", we will present the predictions of different qcd based models for these quantities .",
    "+      the sign excess related to a quark is defined as the ratio of the number of events originated from that quark , which gives a leading particle having its sign , to the number of those which originate from @xmath72 as well , but give a leading particle of opposite sign .",
    "for instance , for the u quark initiating the reaction , it is : @xmath73 , whereas for the @xmath23:@xmath74 .",
    "the sign excess is related directly to the probability @xmath26 : for example , if we have a sign excess of 3 , then the probability @xmath26 for that quark is 75 percent .",
    "here we compare the @xmath75 for the 4 qcd based models .     and @xmath1.,width=566,height=415 ]",
    "each box of the preceding figure has 6 channels , from -3 to 3 .",
    "we use the standard quark identity of the particle data group [ 13]:-3 is @xmath25 , -2 is @xmath23 , -1 is @xmath24 , 1 is @xmath3 , 2 is @xmath2 and 3 is @xmath76 .",
    "the sign excesses are shown for these 6 abscissa of the boxes .",
    "+ it is easily seen that the @xmath3,@xmath24 have less sign excess than @xmath2,@xmath23 ; there are at least 2 reasons : first , in the naive model , the @xmath3 can give a proton as leading particle , which then has the wrong sign ; second , for what concerns charged particles , the @xmath2 can give a @xmath30 or a @xmath31 , the @xmath3 only a @xmath32 and not a @xmath33 [ 14 ] , and the @xmath2 has there also an advantage . +",
    "it is seen that the sign excesses for a quark and its antiparticle are equal ( within statistical errors ) , which is a good consistency check of the models .",
    "+ generally , herwig gives a greater sign excess than rapgap and lepto , which in turn gives more than ariadne .",
    "let us point out that the sign excess reflects on one hand the hadronisation , ( production of mesons and baryons ) , and on the other hand the production of gluons and quarks from an initial quark ( the one from the proton ) .",
    "as ariadne uses the same hadronisation program as rapgap and lepto , we see that there is a sensitivity to the underlying differences in the physics of these models .",
    "the positive excess at the level of quarks : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the number of events where a quark @xmath72 from the proton initiates the reaction . on the next plot",
    "is shown how this quantity varies with @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we can see that , as expected , @xmath28 increases with @xmath0 ( more valence at higher @xmath0 ) , and that , at large @xmath1 , it begins to take important values .",
    "+ the different qcd based models show similar behaviours , except for herwig for@xmath79 gev@xmath55 .     and @xmath1.,width=566,height=415 ]",
    "to recap , the charge that we consider here is the following : @xmath80 , where the sum over @xmath7 extends to all particles having a positive momentum projection on the struck quark direction . + the found mean event charges are shown in the next figure .",
    "herwig predicts a far greater charge than the other models .",
    "the charge increases with @xmath0 for the two ranges in @xmath1 considered .     and @xmath1 for events within the cuts ( mainly @xmath81 leading particle @xmath82).,width=566,height=453 ]",
    "using four qcd based models the charge properties of inclusively produced hadrons in @xmath34 dis processes has been investigated .",
    "deviations of these models have been seen , particularly between those models employing string and cluster hadronisation for the total event charge .",
    "especially , herwig seems to give very different results than lepto , ariadne and rapgap , which all three use the hadronisation program jetset .      * for charge current events , where it should have the sign of the incoming electron or positron in the beam . due to limited statistics",
    ", this could only be an interesting check .",
    "+ * for diffractive events . in the pomeron model ,",
    "the mean event charge is obviously zero .",
    "if we find a mean positive charge in these events , this means either that there is another mechanism involved in the diffraction or that the cuts selecting these diffractive events are not severe enough .",
