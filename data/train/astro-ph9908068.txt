    "4 is a cluster of richness class 1 ( abell 1958 ) located at an average redshift @xmath2  0.0331 .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of this cluster from the x - ray point of view , based on rosat pspc data ( pislar 1998 ) .    in the optical ,",
    "no photometric data had been published , and about 150 redshifts were available from the literature at the beginning of our study ( beers _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , malumuth _ et al .",
    "we undertook a complete analysis of this cluster , with the aim of obtaining both photometric and redshift data at optical wavelengths and couple them with x - ray data .",
    "we present here our photometric data .",
    "the redshift catalogue is published in a companion paper ( durret _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) and the analysis of all these combined optical data will be presented in a coming paper ( durret _ et al . _ in preparation ) .",
    "[ allplate ]    [ histobj ]    the photometric catalogue of the galaxies in the direction of the abcg  496 cluster of galaxies was obtained by processing the field number 621 in the src - j schmidt atlas .",
    "part of the glass copy of this blue plate ( iiiaj@xmath3gg385 ) was investigated in june 1993 with the mama ( machine  mesurer pour lastronomie ) facility located at the centre danalyse des images at the observatoire de paris and operated by cnrs / insu ( institut national des sciences de lunivers ) . due to the cluster location with respect to the plate boundaries , only a 2.5@xmath42.5@xmath5 square region roughly centered on the cluster coordinates could indeed be searched for objects . at the cluster redshift , this limited scan is however large enough to secure a correct investigation of the overall cluster area ( radius of @xmath6  4.5  @xmath7  mpc at least ) .",
    "the algorithms involved in the mama on - line mode available at that time for detecting and measuring astronomical sources are summarized in slezak _",
    "( 1998 ) . basically , objects appear to be defined as a set of connected pixels with intensity higher than typically a 2 sigma threshold above the local sky background and they are described by their flux ( the sum of background - subtracted pixel values , which lead to what is called hereafter a `` plate '' magnitude ) , their area and their elliptical shape parameters .",
    "this approach is efficient in most cases .",
    "however , one must expect that this simple vision model fails for crowded fields where the probability to get blended objects increases drastically when low detection thresholds are applied .",
    "the galactic latitude of abcg  496 is @xmath8 and some blends with stars are indeed included in the 35,541 individual sources listed in the on - line catalogue we were provided with ( cf .",
    "the final visual check of the galaxy candidates which is described below ) .",
    "the astrometric reduction of the whole catalogue was performed with respect to 98 stars of the ppm star catalogue ( roeser & bastian 1991 ) spread over the plate using a 3@xmath9-order polynomial fitting .",
    "the residuals of the fit yielding the instrumental constants were smaller than 0.20 arcsecond and the astrometry of our catalogue indeed appears to be very good , as confirmed by cross - checking galaxy coordinates with the literature or the apm database ( mean average separation : 0.7 arcsecond ) and by our multi - object fibre spectroscopy follow - up where the galaxies were always found to be very close to the expected positions .",
    "the ccd observations needed to calibrate accurately the schmidt plate were not available at that time .",
    "hence , a preliminary photometric calibration of these photographic data has been done using galaxies with known total blue magnitude .",
    "the use of catalogued stars was rejected since such high - surface brightness objects suffer from too severe saturation effects ( coming both from the emulsion itself and from the electronic settings of the mama facility ) .",
    "so , 40 galaxies available in the lyon extragalactic database ( leda , paturel et al .",
    "1997 ) were selected and their magnitudes compared to their measured blue fluxes providing that no close or overlapping objects were present as checked from a small scan around each leda galaxy .",
    "these 31 undisturbed objects span a 3 magnitude range , but in a very non uniform way .",
    "hence , the 3@xmath10 clipping routine used to compute the best fit further discarded 15 objects .",
    "the final rms on the zero - point is unfortunately not better than 0.4 mag owing to : i ) the quite large uncertainty quoted for the total magnitude estimate in the database along with their irregular distribution , ii ) the limited magnitude range , and iii ) differences in the involved flux estimates ( `` plate '' vs. total magnitude ) .",
    "a basic star - galaxy separation has been performed mainly with respect to a classical surface brightness criterion . as usual for glass copies of survey plates , the ability of this criterion to discriminate drops sharply for objects fainter than approximately 19@xmath11 magnitude .",
    "however completeness and purity of any catalogue are most of the time competing goals .",
    "so , another test based on the elongation was then performed in order to reject linear plate flaws , as well as to pick bright elongated galaxies first classified as stars due to strong saturation effects .",
    "finally , spurious detections that occur around very bright stars ( area greater than 10@xmath12 pixels ) due to an incorrect estimate of the local background were tentatively removed by checking their location with respect to these bright objects ( the detection processing included no smoothing ) . down to the detection limit",
    ", we obtained a list of more than 4,000 galaxy candidates over our src - j  621 blue field to the detection limit .",
    "the differential luminosity distribution of our catalogue of diffuse objects indicates that this sample is complete down to the @xmath13  19.5 magnitude ( see fig .  2 ) . however , its purity is less than the usual 95% level for high galactic latitude fields ( cf .",
    "our spectroscopic run indeed indicates a contamination level by stars at least three times higher ( @xmath14  20% , see durret _ et al .",
    "such a low success rate may partly be ascribed to the overall image quality at the plate corner where abcg  496 is located . as usual for schmidt plates",
    "the psf may indeed be quite poor at the borders , which randomly increases the fuzziness of otherwise point - like objects and thereby leads to parameter estimates closer to those of diffuse objects than to genuine star - like ones ( cf .",
    "1 where an overdensity is clearly visible at the edges of the plate ) .",
    "more generally , one can also question the efficiency of the classification procedure itself when the number density of stars is very high .",
    "in fact , a selection mostly based on a surface brightness criterion implies keeping @xmath14  5% of the total number of stars in order to select most of the galaxies .",
    "hence , in most cases , the contamination level of a quite complete galaxy sample unavoidably increases with the star number density .",
    "the galactic latitude of abcg  496 is b@xmath1534.4@xmath5 , which is quite close to the galactic plane and may explain the high absolute number of misclassified single stars .",
    "but , for the present data , blended stars identified as a single diffuse object is the main explanation , as first noticed during the spectroscopic run and partly expected from the involved detection software .",
    "this is confirmed by a check of our list of bright ( @xmath16  17.5 ) galaxy candidates against the apm list for the # 621 src - j field . among our 449 candidates within the same celestial zone ,",
    "389 objects are described as nebular in the apm catalogue , 52 are classified as star - like , 1 is related to a plate flaw while 10 have no close counterpart .",
    "as evidenced by a visual check using the dss , among these 62 discrepant objects , there are 8 genuine galaxies , 2 asymetrical objects , 40 blended stars , 8 single bright stars ( important saturation , diffraction spikes ) , and 4 star - like objects .",
    "so , it appears that only 52 objects are misclassified ( 12% of the total number of candidates ) , out of which 75% are merged images , plus two asymetrical objects .    on one hand , this @xmath14  15% contamination level is disturbing for studies involving individual objects picked among galaxy candidates . on the other hand ,",
    "its net effect for statistical studies is only a decrease of the contrast for the signal of interest providing that the misclassified stars are randomly distributed .",
    "so , for such applications , the present photometric catalogue of abcg  496 certainly remains valuable .",
    "table  1 lists the catalogue of galaxy candidates obtained from the src - j  621 plate in the 2.5@xmath42.5@xmath5 field of abcg  496 .",
    "note that the 101 misclassified stars we were able to identify during our spectroscopic follow - up have been rejected , as well as the 54 objects selected by a visual check ( the 52 misclassified objects and 2 asymetrical objects described above ) , yielding 3,879 entries .",

    "there was almost no overlap between the various fields ( only a few arcseconds ) .",
    "johnson v and r filters were used .",
    "exposure times were 10  mn for all fields ; 1  mn exposures were also taken for a number of fields with bright stars in order to avoid saturation .",
    "the detector was ccd # 28 with 1024@xmath26 pixels of 24  @xmath27 m , giving a sampling on the sky of 0.377''/pixel , and a size of 6.4@xmath286.4  arcmin@xmath26 for each field .",
    "the seeing was poor : 2.4 \" the first night and 1.1  the second night .      corrections for bias and flat - field were performed in the usual way with the iraf software . only flat fields obtained on the sky at twilight and dawn were used ; dome flat fields were discarded because they showed too much structure .",
    "each field was reduced separately .",
    "the photometric calibration took into account a zero point correction , the airmass ( am ) and the color index ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "for the first night , the best fits to obtain the calibrated magnitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 from the measured magnitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 were obtained for the following parameters : + @xmath34 ,    @xmath35 , with    @xmath36 .",

    "note that the color term for the first night in the r band is in fact undefined ; however , we have kept it for the sake of coherence between all calibrations .",
    "it also appears that both the tranformation and extinction terms for this first night strongly differ from those for the second night . for the first night",
    ", the range in standards and in air - mass is smaller , which may explain the discrepancy , together with perhaps poorer photometric conditions .",
    "since the exposure times were the same in v and r , a number of galaxies were detected in r but not in v. for these objects , a photometric calibration was performed without using a color term .",
    "the corresponding relations were : @xmath52 for the first night and @xmath53 for the second night .",
    "the corresponding error bars on these parameters are : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "objects were automatically detected using the daophot/ daofind tasks of iraf .",
    "this task first performs a convolution with a gaussian with characteristics set according to the seeing in each frame ( fwhm of the star - like profiles in the image ) as well as the ccd readout noise and gain .",
    "objects are then identified as the peaks of the convolved image which are higher than a given threshold above the local sky background ( chosen as approximately equal to 4 times the _ rms _ of the mean sky level on the image ) . a list of detected objects is thus produced and interactively corrected on the displayed image so as to discard spurious objects , add undetected ones ( usually close to the ccd edges ) by modifying the detection parameters and dispose of false detections .",
    "we used the package developed by le fvre ( le fvre _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 ) to obtain for each field a catalogue with the ( x , y ) galaxy positions , isophotal radii , excentricities , major axis , position angles , and v and r magnitudes within the 26.5 isophote . to perform a star - galaxy classification based on the compactness parameter described in le fvre _ et al . _",
