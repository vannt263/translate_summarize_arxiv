    "the structure of bound , starless cores ( e.g. , myers , linke , & benson 1983 ; benson & myers 1989 ) is not well known .",
    "this structure is important , as it should drive the ensuing evolution of the core , and give insight into the initial conditions of star formation free from the disruption of a central protostar .",
    "ward - thompson , scott , hills , & andr ( 1994 ) detected millimeter and submillimeter continuum radiation from dust in these regions , and dubbed them preprotostellar cores ( ppcs ) .    following this detection , significant work has continued toward determining the conditions associated with these regions .",
    "ward - thompson , scott , hills , & andr ( 1994 ) inferred that the density distributions do not follow isothermal sphere distributions ( @xmath16 ) over a range of cores , a result supported by various other studies ( e.g. andr , ward - thompson , & motte 1996 ; ward - thompson , motte , & andr 1999 ; bacmann et al .",
    "these studies utilized semi - analytic techniques to infer the dust density distribution .",
    "similar techniques such as colour temperature variation , were used by ward - thompson , andr , & kirk ( 2002 ) ( along with iso flux data ) to infer the temperature distribution and to place constraints on the luminosity of the central source .",
    "while many of these semi - analytic approaches yield physically meaningful information , the specifics of the approach can affect the reliability of the conclusions ( doty & palotti 2002 ) .",
    "submillimeter ( submm ) data for many ppcs were obtained from the submillimeter common - user bolometric array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) by shirley et al .",
    "2000 . in an analysis of these data , evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) assumed spherical symmetry and utilized a self - consistent dust radiative transfer model to infer the properties and structure of their source sample .",
    "they found that bonner - ebert ( be ) spheres provided good fits to the data , with l1544 requiring the highest central density , @xmath17 @xmath18 , in fact .",
    "however , a power - law density distribution could not be ruled out when a self - consistent dust temperature variation was included .",
    "this result , while intriguing , relies upon the assumed underlying source geometry .",
    "unfortunately , the observed isophotes for l1544 are decidedly non - spherical , leading to potential uncertainty in these conclusions .    in this paper",
    "we report on a study comparing existing data with detailed , three - dimensional , continuum radiative transfer models to constrain the conditions associated with l1544 . in section two ,",
    "we describe l1544 and previously inferred properties .",
    "we briefly describe the model and range of parameter space considered in section three . in section four",
    ", we compare the models with observations in constraining the source properties .",
    "finally , we conclude in section five .",
    "l1544 is located in taurus at a distance of 140 pc ( elias 1978 ) .",
    "the source has been well - observed .",
    "there is no reported iras source associated with the core ( ward - thompson , scott , hills , & andr 1994 ) .",
    "however , submillimeter data have been obtained at the jcmt at 450 , 850 , and 1100 @xmath19 m with a single element by ward - thompson , scott , hills , & andr ( 1994 ) , and using scuba ( shirley et al .",
    "further submillimeter data were taken at 1.3-mm using iram ( ward - thompson , scott , hills , & andr 1994 ; ward - thompson , motte , & andr 1999 ) .",
    "l1544 has also been studied with the _ infrared space observatory_. in particular , bacmann et al .",
    "( 2000 ) utilized isocam imaging data ( @xmath20 m ) , while ward - thompson , andr , & kirk ( 2002 ) utilized the isophot photometer at 90 , 170 , & 200 @xmath19 m .    in table 1 , we reproduce the observed fluxes that we adopt in our study .",
    "we choose the 450 , 850 , and 1300 @xmath19 m data from shirley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as the results are from an array , rather than a single element bolometer .",
    "the 90 , 170 , & 200 @xmath19 m fluxes are taken from ward - thompson , andr , & kirk ( 2002 ) . in both cases , the uncertainties in table 1 are the quoted statistical uncertainties added in quadrature with an assumed 30 per cent calibration uncertainty in the data .",

    "we have constructed models for the non - spherical protostellar core l1544 utilizing a fully three - dimensional continuum radiative transfer model .",
    "after convolving the model output with the actual scuba beam profile , we are able to compare our results with existing observations , including both seds and sky maps . based upon this work , we find that :    \\1 .",
    "it is possible to constrain the optical depth and density distribution .",
    "while a degeneracy in this plane exists as noted by doty & palotti ( 2002 ) , the spatial intensity distribution more nearly breaks the degeneracy .",
    "in particular , we find @xmath6 , and @xmath22 . likewise , we find that an ellipsoidal density power law with an exponent @xmath0 @xmath23 ) , can fit the observations well .",
    "while a bonner - ebert - like centrally flattened density distribution can not be ruled out , the central flattening can be restricted to @xmath24 pc @xmath25 au ( sect .",
    "the isrf and central luminosity are nearly orthogonal parameters .",
    "the isrf can be constrained to be within @xmath26 per cent of that defined by mathis , mezger , & panagia ( 1983 ) , somewhat higher than previously inferred from spherical modeling .",
    "the central luminosity can also be constrained to @xmath8 l@xmath9 , consistent with the assignation of this source as a pre - protostellar object ( sect .",
    "the diameter and axis - ratio show a limited degeneracy , which is again broken by the spatial intensity distribution .",
    "we infer a long - axis diameter of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , and an axis ratio @xmath14 .",
    "the outer diameter and axis ratio may each be somewhat larger due to potential on - source chopping in the observations , and the projection of the long axis onto the plane of the sky .",
    "both the diameter ( @xmath27 ) and the axis ratio ( @xmath28 ) are less than would be inferred directly from observations , and are due to radiative transfer effects and non - spherical geometry ( sect .",
    "the values and ranges of values found here are roughly consistent with those inferred directly from observations or spherical modeling , due to the relative transparency of the source at the wavelengths of observation . in general , we infer a smaller source of lower mass and higher optical depth / column density than previously assumed ( sect .",
    "the sed yields degenerate fits .",
    "a `` best - fit '' requires both the sed and surface brightness distribution .",
    "this approach , combined with a large grid of models ( @xmath29 ) , can yield a best - fit and range of uncertainty in inferred parameters .",
    "interestingly , a range of 10 ( @xmath30 ) or even 4 ( @xmath31 ) in @xmath15 can yield remarkably different quality of fit ( sect .",
