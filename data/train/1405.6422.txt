    "quantum state transfer  @xcite between arbitrary distant sites is an important task for quantum information processing .",
    "the perfect state transfer can be implemented via quantum data bus to connect distant sites on a quantum network . in this paper",
    "we consider two related research fields , quantum walks ( qws ) on one - dimensional or higher - dimensional lattices and perfect state transfer .",
    "we present a realization of arbitrary unknown state transfer in a qw architecture .",
    "quantum walks were first introduced by aharonov et .",
    "@xcite in 1993 .",
    "their work has shown that the average path length , which corresponds to the propagate velocity of the walker , can be much larger than that of the classical random walk , due to quantum interference effects .",
    "this property makes qw to be promising to develop new quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the qw is also an promising resource for quantum simulation  @xcite and for universal quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "various studies for implementing qws in different physical systems have been made  @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations in various physical systems have been reported  @xcite .",
    "the qw has been proposed as an efficient way to perfectly transfer unknown quantum states and therefore transfer quantum information without requirement of extra control  @xcite .",
    "the task of quantum state transfer has been introduced in the context of quantum computation as a protocol to establish interactions between separated qubits on the network .",
    "the network can be used for the transfer and distribution of arbitrary unknown qubits and multi - qubits entanglement , which are important resources for teleportation  @xcite , error correction  @xcite and the other tasks  @xcite in quantum information processing .    under the evolution of qw , with full control of the walker+coin system",
    "the target state can be transferred between arbitrary input and output ports in a network of arbitrary spatial dimension .",
    "we regard the task as perfect routing which is more useful in a computational architecture than state transfer .",
    "we show how arbitrary networks can be designed for routing multi - qubit quantum states between arbitrary sites with a time scaling that is linear to the distance to be covered .    in this paper ,",
    "we present a scheme on perfectly transferring unknown state and routing quantum information in architecture of qws on regular network .",
    "we transfer the coin states between arbitrary sites by manipulating the coin flipping .",
    "our protocol benefits from the full control of the walker+coin system . compared to the previous protocols on quantum state transfer , transferring the coin state is more feasible and easier to extend to multi - qubit entanglement transfer releasing the requirement of periodicity of qws .",
    "the walker carries the coin prepared in a certain state , which needs to be transferred , and walks from the original site to the target site with time - dependent coin flippings for each step .",
    "thus the coin state is perfectly transferred between two sites .",
    "furthermore , we extend the method to distribute multi - qubit entanglement between arbitrary sites resulting in a possible implementation of efficient quantum routing .    this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    ", we give a brief introduction to a discrete - time qw on line , and illustrate two kinds of biased coin flipping operators , which play a critical role in our scheme .",
    "the content of the scheme for realizing quantum routing based on controllable perfect state transfer via discrete - time qw is showed in sec . .",
    "we extend the scheme from one dimensional quantum routing to two dimensional case , routing entangled qubits to two arbitrary positions .",
    "we also show the scheme can be extended to high dimensional case .",
    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) qw on the line describes qw of a walker whose motion is restricted on the line  @xcite . for the discrete - time qw , there is another freedom degree which acts as the coin .",
    "the state of the walker - coin system is denoted by a vector in the hilbert space @xmath0 , where the subscripts @xmath1 , @xmath2 stand for walker and coin respectively .",
    "the motion of the walk is conditioned by the coin state via a conditional shift operator @xmath3 where the summation symbol denotes for sum over all possible positions .",
    "the relations of the coin states and the directions of walk are showed in fig .",
    "the whole walking process is realized by repeating the sequence of the coin flipping operator and the conditional shift operator eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) step by step ( so called discrete - time ) .",
    "the coin flipping operator is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the identity operator of the walker , and @xmath6 is the flipping operator applied on the coin state .",
    "standard discrete - time qw is performed with unbiased coin flipping operators ( hadamard operator ) . here",
    "we introduce two biased coin flipping operators , the identity operator @xmath5 and the pauli operator @xmath7 , which are used in our scheme .",
    "the coin states remain unchanged under the coin operator @xmath5 and therefore the direction of the walker keeps same as that for the previous step .",
    "the pauli operator @xmath7 performs exactly contrary with @xmath5 .",
    "it makes the coin states be entirely flipped ( i.e. @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , and the walker turns to the direction reversed to that for the previous step .",
    "( seeing fig . 1 ( b ) )",
    "we introduce a basic scheme to transfer the coin state through 1d discrete - time qw firstly .",
    "the initial state of the walker - coin system is @xmath10 denotes the state describing the system after the @xmath11th step , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are complex numbers , and @xmath14 . in our scheme",
    "the coin states @xmath15 is transferred to a certain position @xmath16 after arbitrary @xmath17 steps discrete - time qw .",
    "the total process can be described as @xmath18th step needs to be at the position @xmath19 or @xmath20 . because states in other positions can not walk to the position @xmath16 in one step , which result in the possibility of the walker in position @xmath16 less than 1 .",
    "thus the state after the @xmath21th step is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) is the complex amplitude , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the coin state corresponding to the walker in position @xmath16 after the @xmath17th step . since the walker is able to propagate to @xmath20 or @xmath19 at the @xmath21th step , we have @xmath27 which restricts the range of the position that the coin state can be perfectly transferred .",
    "another restriction is that for even ( odd ) step numbers the coin state can be only transferred to the even ( odd ) positions .",
    "for example , if the walking was stated from @xmath28 , which is @xmath29 where @xmath17 is the number of the step , @xmath16 is the position , and @xmath30 stands for the combination of all integers .",
    "performing the @xmath17th step gives @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the coin flipping operator performed on the position @xmath16 of the @xmath17th step .",
    "after @xmath21 step , the walker in the positions @xmath33 walks to the position @xmath16 at the @xmath17th step .",
    "thus we can obtain @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 is dependent on @xmath36 only and @xmath13 on @xmath37 only . in our scheme the unknown information carried by @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be transferred to the position @xmath33",
    "after @xmath21 steps respectively and then after the @xmath17th step the state @xmath38 is transferred to the position @xmath16 .",
    "we show the detailed process below .     from position @xmath39 to @xmath40 after 5 steps discrete - time qw .",
    "the red and blue arrows indicate the directions of the information flows of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the protocol is showed in both tree diagram ( the upper one ) and the number axis case.,width=302 ]    the whole state of the walker - coin system after the @xmath41st step is @xmath42 .",
    "we choose @xmath43 , and then get latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq:8 }     we now show how the walking be performed between the @xmath41st and the @xmath21th step ( totally @xmath45 steps ) .",
    "we also use @xmath7 or @xmath5 as the coin flipping operators all through the process .",
    "the walker in the position @xmath41 walks straight ( along right ) for @xmath46 steps and then turns around ( along left ) for @xmath47 steps to reach the position @xmath19 at the @xmath21th step .",
    "we have @xmath48 the solutions are @xmath49 at the same time the walker in position @xmath50 walks straight ( along left ) for @xmath47 steps and then turns around ( along right ) for @xmath46 steps .",
    "with the same values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , the walker starts from the position @xmath50 arrives at the position @xmath19 at the @xmath21th step controlled by the coin state .",
    "the state of the walker - coin system after the @xmath11th step is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is unit step function , which equals to @xmath41 when @xmath53 , otherwise @xmath39 . with the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:10 ] ) , the final state of the system after the @xmath17th step is @xmath54 .",
    "thus the goal to transfer an unknown coin state to a certain position at arbitrary @xmath17 steps is successfully achieved .",
    "a simple example of transferring the coin states from position @xmath28 to @xmath55 via @xmath56 steps discrete - time qw is shown in fig . 1 ( c ) .",
    "the scheme can be used as an efficient quantum routing with each achievable position corresponding to a user located on the network .",
    "it is necessary to notice that not all the positions are possible to be routed to within a fixed number of steps ( restricted by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "however , we can let the achievable positions correspond to the users , while others act as ancillary positions .",
    "if the walking continues with the coin flipping operator @xmath57 ( like what we do to the initial state at the @xmath41st step ) , the state of the system after the @xmath58th step is @xmath59 keeping the flipping operators corresponding to the positions as before , the states of the following steps are @xmath60 the state after the @xmath61th step is @xmath62 thus the system interestingly back to the initial states ( both position and coin state ) . iterating the process shows that the process has a periodicity , which has also been seen in many important works about state transfer  @xcite , with period of @xmath61 .     from the original position ( 0,0 ) to the target position ( 1,3 ) after 5 steps .",
    "the first walker walks along the @xmath16 axis and the second walker walks along the @xmath63 axis .",
    "the red and blue arrows indicate the information flows of @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    ", width=302 ]      now let us think about the 2d discrete - time qws , in which the coins control the walker to walk different directions ( seeing fig .",
    "2 ( a ) ) . in this subsection",
    "we focus on the case in which the two coins are entangled , which is more interesting and significant for many quantum information process .",
    "the flipping of two coins is @xmath64 , where the superscripts @xmath65 , @xmath66 stand for the first and second coin .",
    "it is a local operation and does not break the entanglement between the two walk - coin systems .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how to transfer the unknown entangled coin state @xmath67 from the original position @xmath68 to the final position @xmath69 after @xmath17 steps .",
    "the whole process can be described as @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "one can set the coin flipping operator @xmath74 of the @xmath11th walker in position @xmath75 at the @xmath17th step to be @xmath76 when one wants the walker to turn around at position in the step , otherwise to be @xmath5 .",
    "the whole scheme is expressed as below .",
    "setting @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath78 , the state after @xmath41st step is latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq:16 }    the state of the first coin is in @xmath28 and @xmath80 , corresponding to the walker in position @xmath41 and @xmath50 .",
    "routing it to @xmath19 and @xmath20 is actually similar to 1d case surveyed before . according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) , the walker in position @xmath41 walks straight ( along right ) for @xmath81 steps , turns around at @xmath82 during the @xmath83th step , then walks straight ( along left ) for @xmath84 steps to reach @xmath20 at the @xmath21th step . at the same time",
    ", the walker in @xmath50 walks straight ( along left ) for @xmath85 steps , then turn around at @xmath86 during the @xmath87th step , then walks straight ( along right ) for @xmath88 steps will reach @xmath89 at the @xmath21th step .",
    "whereas the state of the second coin is in @xmath28 and @xmath80 , corresponding to the walker in position @xmath80 and @xmath90 .",
    "routing it to @xmath89 and @xmath91 is exactly same with the process of the first walker - coin system with @xmath92 and @xmath93 the four biased coin flipping operators can meet the requirements of the whole process .",
    "the following states can be similarly expressed as    @xmath94,[-i+2(i - b_2 - 1)\\varepsilon(i - b_2 - 2)]\\rangle^i|\\varepsilon(i - a_1 - 2),\\varepsilon(b_2 + 1-i)\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 is the step function . with @xmath96 , @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) taking the value of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) , ( [ eq:18 ] ) , ( [ eq:19 ] ) and ( [ eq:20 ] ) , the state after the @xmath17th step is latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq:22 }    the unknown entangled coin state is successfully routed to the target positions , in other words , successfully delivered to the users corresponding to the positions .",
    "quantum information process based on entanglement sharing can be carried on successfully after the efficient routing .",
    "a simple example of transfer an unknown coin state @xmath67 form position @xmath68 to @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) .    continue the walking with a @xmath101 flipping operator , and other coin flipping operators correspondent to the positions as before .",
    "we surprisingly find the coin states perfectly transferred to the initial position after @xmath61 steps .    for multi coins in architecture of high dimensional ( say @xmath102 , @xmath103 ) discrete - time qw , the efficient routing scheme can be developed based on the way we develop the 1d scheme to 2d entangled case .",
    "the special setting ( @xmath7 ) of each walker - coin system is depends on the target position and the step numbers .",
    "efficient routing @xmath102 coins needs @xmath104 special settings .",
    "this grows linearly with the number of the coins .",
    "in summary , we have proposed an efficient routing scheme with arbitrary unknown state transferring from input to arbitrary output ports , which is promising to be implemented in experiment .",
    "one can perfectly transferring the unknown coin state in 1d discrete - time qw from the initial position to any target position , and the settings are simple and independent of the number of the target positions .",
    "one needs set three special coin flipping operators ( @xmath76 ) , while live the others to be @xmath5 .",
    "efficient routing can be implemented based on perfect state transfer .",
    "the scheme is also efficient for routing multi - qubit entanglement .",
    "the number of special settings in routing multi - coin states in high dimensional qw grows linearly with the number of coins , which makes our protocol feasible with the current experimental technology .",
    "besides the potential value in quantum communication and quantum computation processes , the scheme generates periodicity in discrete - time qw on line , which is traditionally seen in discrete - time qw on periodic graph  @xcite .",
    "this gives a deep inspiration of exploring potential application of discrete - time qw on line .",
