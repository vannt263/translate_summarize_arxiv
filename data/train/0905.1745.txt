    "the capacity of the interference channel has been an open problem for over thirty years .",
    "the key to making progress on this problem is to pursue capacity approximations . taking this approach , seminal work by etkin ,",
    "tse and wang @xcite has produced the capacity characterization within one bit for the two user gaussian interference channel . by further tightening one outer bound in @xcite ,",
    "the sum capacity has been shown to be achievable by treating interference as noise in a very weak interference regime ( also known as noisy interference regime ) @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the succuss of this characterization follows from two important techniques , deterministic approach and generalized degrees of freedom . by focusing on the interaction between desired signals and interference ,",
    "i.e. , de - emphasizing local noise , the deterministic channels provide fundamental insights into their gaussian counterparts @xcite@xcite .",
    "the gdof perspective , introduced in @xcite , presents a coarse , but insightful picture of the optimal achievable schemes and outer bounds for the interference channel .",
    "in particular , the gdof picture for the symmetric case - which we refer to as the `` w '' curve- has come to represent the interference channel in the same way as the pentagonal capacity region is associated with the multiple access channel .",
    "the w curve delineates very weak , weak , moderate , strong and very strong interference regimes , each with a distinct character .",
    "the next logical step is to extend these insights to interference",
    "_ networks _",
    "- i.e. , interference channels with more than 2 users . extensions to more than 2 users have turned out to be non - trivial due to the emergence of some fundamentally new issues that are unique to interference networks . in particular , the idea of interference alignment is introduced in the context of interference networks by cadambe and jafar in @xcite as the principal determinant of the network degrees of freedom ( capacity pre - log ) . the extent to which interference can be aligned is very difficult to determine precisely in general . for this reason , _",
    "even the exact capacity pre - log factor is unknown _ for almost all interference networks , including , e.g. the 3 user interference channel with constant channel coefficients@xcite@xcite .",
    "since the capacity pre - log dominates all other factors in a capacity approximation , most attempts to gain useful insights for interference networks get caught in the intricacies of interference alignment and do not make it past the degree - of - freedom question .",
    "notable exceptions include the perfectly symmetric @xmath7 user interference channel considered in @xcite , and many - to - one ( and one - to - many ) interference channels considered in @xcite .",
    "jafar and vishwanath @xcite use interference alignment to show that the ( per - user ) gdof characterization of the @xmath7 user interference channel in a perfectly symmetric setting is identical to the 2 user w curve except for one point of discontinuity - which does not allow the results to be translated into a capacity approximation within @xmath8 .",
    "bresler et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "successfully navigate the issue of interference alignment to find a capacity approximation within a constant number of bits , but for the limited case where only one receiver sees interference .",
    "we note that while interference alignment is an important element in the many - to - one interference channel , it is not necessary to determine the capacity pre - log .",
    "in fact , the degrees - of - freedom region for the many - to - one interference channel is achieved quite simply through time - division .",
    "our goal is to explore whether , and in what form , the @xmath9 curve generalizes to interference networks with more than 2 users and , more importantly , to be able to go beyond gdof , to capacity characterization within @xmath3 and to exact capacity in certain regimes .",
    "consider the @xmath7 user mimo gaussian interference channel with @xmath10 antennas at each transmitter and @xmath2 antennas at each receiver .",
    "the degrees of freedom of this channel are characterized in @xcite when the ratio @xmath11 is equal to an integer .",
    "the main results of @xcite are summarized in fig .",
    "as we can see , there are three distinct regimes .",
    "for the first regime , i.e. , @xmath12 , there is no competition among the users for degrees of freedom .",
    "each user can access @xmath13 degree of freedom ( the maximum possible ) by zero forcing all the interference , regardless of the strength of the interference .",
    "the degrees of freedom , as well as the gdof and the @xmath3 capacity characterization in this case are trivial ( excluding some degenerate cases ) . for @xmath14 , @xcite shows that the degrees of freedom per user can not be more than @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "the interference alignment problem becomes challenging and the exact degrees of freedom are unknown ( @xcite provides a tight inner bound only for time - varying / frequency - selective channels ) in general , making it difficult to go beyond degrees of freedom .",
    "however , if @xmath17 , the mimo interference channel has exactly @xmath18 degrees of freedom per user ( excluding degenerate cases ) and achievability follows by simple zero forcing and time sharing .",
    "while the degrees of freedom problem is simple , the competition among the users for the channel degrees of freedom means that the gdof problem is interesting and depends on the relative strength of the desired and interfering signals .",
    "this is the case we study in this paper .",
    "note that for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , our channel model reduces to the classical two user interference channel and the results , e.g. the w curve , of @xcite should be recovered in that case .",
    "we study the @xmath0 user simo gaussian interference channel with @xmath2 antennas at each receiver . in order to obtain a compact characterization",
    ", we focus on the symmetric case where all direct links have the same signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and undesired links have the same interference - to - noise ratio ( inr ) . however , no symmetry is assumed for the directions of the channel vectors .",
    "inspired by the connection between the deterministic approach and the gdof of its gaussian counterpart , which leads to the constant bits characterization in the two user case , we also would like to first investigate the problem through the corresponding deterministic channel .",
    "however , the deterministic channel model proposed in @xcite can not be applied to multiple antennas cases@xcite .",
    "instead , we generalize the el gamal and costa model @xcite to interference channels with multiple antennas . the key assumption of the el gamal and costa model for the two user interference channel is the invertibility , i.e. , at each receiver , given the desired signal , the interference from the other transmitter can be uniquely determined .",
    "this assumption makes this model tractable and also emulates the two user gaussian interference channel . how to generalize this model to emulate the simo gaussian interference channels ?",
    "again the invertibility is essential which also captures the essential feature of this class of simo gaussian interference channels .",
    "consider the 3 user simo interference channel with 2 antennas at each receiver .",
    "given the desired signal ( in the absence of noise ) , each receiver can determine the individual interference from each of the interfering transmitters .",
    "this is because the number of antennas at each receiver is equal to the number of transmit antennas at all interferers combined .",
    "therefore after the desired signal has been removed , each interference signal is individually isolated by a simple channel matrix inversion operation at each receiver .",
    "thus , we model the simo interference channel in the deterministic framework of el gamal and costa , by the assumption that , given the signal from the desired transmitter , each receiver is able to recover each of the interfering signals from its received signal . we characterize the capacity region of this deterministic channel .",
    "the optimal achievable scheme for this @xmath0 user symmetric deterministic interference channel turns out to be a natural extension of the han kobayashi scheme previously shown to be optimal for the 2 user ( @xmath21 ) case .",
    "the capacity region for the deterministic channel also reveals interesting new forms of rate bounds that are not trivial extensions of the 2 user case .",
    "user simo gaussian interference channel with @xmath2 antennas at each receiver , width=499 ]    based on the insights provided by the deterministic channel , we characterize the generalized degrees of freedom of the @xmath0 user simo symmetric gaussian interference channels with @xmath2 antennas at each receiver .",
    "the gdof curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ gdof ] . note that for @xmath21 , the 2 user gdof of @xcite is obtained .",
    "similar to the 2 user gaussian interference channel with single antenna nodes , there are five distinct regimes .",
    "the key elements of the achievability and converse for the gdof characterization are summarized as follows . in each case",
    ", we highlight one major similarity to the 2 user case and one major difference .",
    "1 .   achievability : * similarity : the idea of setting the private message power so that it is received at the noise floor of the undesired receivers carries over from the 2 user interference channel .",
    "* difference : unlike the 2 user case , the noisy interference regime disappears from the gdof picture .",
    "intuitively , this may be understood as follows .",
    "the limiting factor for this regime ( @xmath22 ) in the 2 user case is the `` noise '' from the _ desired _ users private message , which reduces the pre - log factor of the common message rates to zero ( the private messages of the remaining users do not matter because they are received at the level of the noise floor ) .",
    "however , in the simo case , the noise from the desired users private message can be nulled by losing one dimension , while still leaving @xmath23 dimensions to decode the common messages from the remaining @xmath2 users with a non - zero pre - log factor .",
    "converse : * similarity : the outer bound that is tight for the second `` v '' of the w curve comes from a `` many - to - one '' interference channel outer bound .",
    "this is the counterpart to the `` z '' interference channel sum capacity outer bound used for the corresponding regime in the 2 user case .",
    "* difference : the outer bound that is tight for the first `` v '' of the w curve ( the weak interference regime ) is a new outer bound which , unlike the two user case , is not in the form of a direct sum - rate bound .",
    "for example , with 3 users the outer bound comes from rate bounds that take the form @xmath24 .",
    "however , as in the 2 user case , the outer bound emerges from studying the el gamal and costa deterministic channel model .",
    "the gdof characterization leads directly to the capacity approximation within @xmath3 , i.e. , the gap to the exact capacity is a constant which is _ independent _ of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "instead , the gap depends on other channel parameters , e.g. , the _ angles _ between channel vectors . to further investigate how angles among channel vectors affect the gap , we study the 3 user completely symmetric gaussian interference channel with 2 antennas at each receiver . by completely symmetric , we mean that not only all snrs , inrs are equal , respectively , but also the relative orientations of the desired signal and interference vectors are identical at each receiver . it turns out that the gap only depends on the angle between two interfering vectors ( it does not depend on the angle between the desired channel vector and the interfering channel vector ) . when the angle is large , the gap is small , but if the angle is small , the gap is large .",
    "in fact , this angle indicates the possibility of interference alignment .",
    "the role of the angles between channel vectors is also highlighted by wang and tse in @xcite for a three - to - one gaussian interference channel where only one receiver equipped with 2 antennas sees interference .",
    "they show that han - kobayashi - type scheme with gaussian codebook can achieve the capacity region within a number of bits , which depends on the angle between two interfering channel vectors .",
    "the gap becomes unbounded when the angle becomes small .",
    "wang and tse @xcite provide a partial interference alignment scheme to get a better performance where the transmit signal is a superposition of gaussian codewords and lattice codewords .",
    "after decoding the gaussian codewords , the signal is projected onto one direction such that interference alignment can be done using lattice code as in @xcite . however , since only one receiver sees interference , the many - to - one setting is significantly different from the fully connected interference channel considered in this work .",
    "we also derive an outer bound on the capacity region of the 3 user simo gaussian interference channel ( not necessarily symmetric ) with 2 antennas at each receiver .",
    "this outer bound directly leads to the capacity region of the strong interference regime of this channel , where each receiver can decode all messages .",
    "the 2 user deterministic interference channel studied in @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ twousermodel ] . the interference @xmath25 and channel outputs @xmath26 are deterministic functions of inputs @xmath27 , respectively : @xmath28 where @xmath29 are deterministic functions .",
    "in addition , @xmath30 satisfies conditions @xmath31 for all product distributions on @xmath32 . in other words ,",
    "given @xmath33 , function @xmath30 is invertible .",
    "the capacity region of this class of interference channels is found in @xcite .",
    "the achievable scheme is the han - kobayashi scheme which assigns the common information to interfering signal which is visible to the other link , i.e. , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the connection of this deterministic channel to the two user gaussian interference channel is discussed in @xcite . on the achievability side",
    ", it is argued that the portion of the received interfering signal above the noise level , i.e. , the interfering signal which is visible to the other link , should be the common information @xcite . on the converse side ,",
    "the outer bounds for the deterministic channel give some hints of what genie information should be given to receivers for the gaussian case .",
    "we further illustrate this point through an example .",
    "for the 2 user deterministic interference channel , the sum capacity is shown @xcite to be bounded by @xmath36 for the 2 user gaussian interference channel , a new outer bound derived by etkin , tse and wang @xcite , which we refer to as the etw bound , is @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are interfering signals from transmitter 1 and 2 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath40 comparing with , we can see that @xmath38 and @xmath39 for the gaussian channel are counterparts to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the deterministic case .",
    "the outer bounds for the deterministic channel and the gaussian channel are very similar , except that there is no noise terms in the deterministic case .",
    "therefore , the outer bound for the deterministic channel gives some hints of what side information should be given to receivers in the gaussian case .",
    "for example , in order to have @xmath41 and @xmath42 , we may give @xmath38 to receiver 1 and @xmath39 to receiver 2 , which leads to the etw bound .",
    "inspired by the connection of the 2 user deterministic interference channel to the gaussian case , we would like to study the corresponding deterministic channel of the 3 user simo gaussian interference channel with 2 antennas at each receiver . while we are studying only the 3 user case ,",
    "the insights from this allow us to tackle the @xmath0 user , @xmath1 simo gaussian interference channel .",
    "note that the key assumption of the el gamal and costa model for the two user interference channel is the invertibility .",
