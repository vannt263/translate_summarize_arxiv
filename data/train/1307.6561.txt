    "the ejecta of supernovae ( sn ) encode important information about the sn explosion dynamics , the nucleosynthetic yield , and the formation of interstellar dust and molecules . at optical and x - ray wavelengths ,",
    "the dominant feature of sn  1987a is a rapidly brightening 1.66 @xmath4 0.03  @xcite ring of `` hot spots '' where the blast wave is colliding with the innermost of three circumstellar rings @xcite . in the radio , this ring can be seen as two bright lobes of emission @xcite . inside this ring ,",
    "optical and near - infrared spectra showed that the debris from the progenitor s stellar interior is clumped into chemically distinct fragments , originating from the nucleosynthesis that took place before and during the supernova explosion .",
    "as the remnant cooled , dust formed and began to obscure the inner ejecta from view at optical wavelengths within the first few years .",
    "it was recently estimated that the ejecta of sn1987a contains 0.4 - 0.7 m@xmath0  of dust at a temperature of  20 k @xcite .",
    "fortunately , observations at far - infrared ( fir ) to millimeter wavelengths pierce through the dust , providing a window into the cool interior @xcite .",
    "a small mass ( @xmath5 m@xmath0 ) of hot , vibrationally excited co was seen 192 days after the explosion @xcite , but the emission faded below detection limits after @xmath2600 days , when the gas became too cool to excite vibrational transitions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* k at 800 days ) .",
    "theoretical models predict that co formation would continue after that time , yielding @xmath2 0.1 m@xmath0  of co @xcite by 1000 days .",
    "such a mass of co would have important implications for the evolution of the ejecta , as discussed in @xcite : first , dust synthesis can be limited by the depletion of elements by molecules , and second , co is a powerful coolant , and a cooler environment will favor more efficient dust and molecule formation .    the ejecta of at least 8 other supernove have been observed in the vibrational co fundamental ( 4.65 @xmath6 m ) or first overtone ( 2.3 @xmath6 m ) bands , all within the first few years after their explosion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see references listed within their table 1 ) .",
    "a notable addition is the 300 year old cassiopeia  a remnant , where @xcite detected vibrationally excited @xmath7co with a mass of @xmath8 m@xmath0  and temperature as high as 900 - 1400  k. until now no direct evidence ( via _ rotational _",
    "molecular emission ) had been found for cold ( @xmath9 k ) molecular gas within supernova remnants , and no measurement made between @xmath10 and 300 years post - explosion . with the atacama",
    "large millimeter array ( alma ) , we have now imaged the ejecta of sn1987a and , for the first time , detected rotational transitions of co inside a supernova remnant .",
    "sn  1987a was observed with alma at wavelengths of 2.6 mm ( band 3 ) and 1.3 mm ( band 6 ) between april and august 2012 . during the 2012 early science period ,",
    "alma had only a fraction of its final spatial resolution and sensitivity , but could already obtain synthesized beam spatial resolutions of @xmath2 1.6 @xmath11 1.5  and 0.6 @xmath11 0.5 , respectively .",
    "observation dates and parameters are listed in table  [ obsparm ] .",
    "both bands were observed using frequency division mode ( fdm ) , i.e. 488 khz channels , to enable detection of any narrow emission lines ( none were detected ) , and later averaged to 50 km s@xmath3 spectral resolution ( corresponding to one hundred sixty 19 mhz channels in band 3 ) .",
    "the bandwidth per spectral window was 1.875 ghz .",
    "all observations used quasars j0538 - 440 and j0637 - 752 as bandpass and phase calibrators , respectively .",
    "callisto was observed as an absolute flux calibrator ; the absolute flux scale was then applied to the x352 and x1c blocks by equating the flux densities of the two quasars to the flux densities calibrated against a solar system object .",
    "system temperature and precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) calibrations were applied before standard bandpass and complex gain ( phase ) calibration . in the synthesis imaging , the robust parameter",
    "was set to 0 , midway between natural and uniform weighting @xcite .",

    "to determine the upper limits , we took an artificial @xmath7co input spectrum with zero continuum and all eight lines given fluxes of 8.7 @xmath26 w m@xmath20 and very narrow widths .",
    "we then broadened the lines with a gaussian function having a fwhm of 2300 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we added the broadened @xmath7co line spectrum , multiplied by flux scaling factors ranging from 1 to 10 , to the observed slw and ssw subspectra in order to judge the flux scaling factor needed for each @xmath7co line to yield a definite detection ( as judged by a line flux measurement that yielded a line flux within 30% of the input value ) .",
    "most of the emitting @xmath7co is expected to reside in chemically distinct clumps , composed mostly of oxygen and carbon , in the inner supernova debris @xcite .",
    "we interpret the observed @xmath7co emission lines with a simplified model , in which a total mass @xmath27 of @xmath7co molecules is found in clumps of uniform density and temperature ( @xmath28 ) that occupy a volume @xmath29 of the inner debris .",
    "we assume that the inner debris is confined within a freely expanding sphere of volume @xmath30 defined by radius @xmath31 km s@xmath32 25 years .",
    "( note that the diameter , twice this expansion radius , fully encompasses the fwhm of the line emission ) .",
    "the clumps occupy a fraction , @xmath33 , of that total volume , such that @xmath34 . in reality , the carbon / oxygen zone is likely composed of clumps that do vary in chemical composition , density , and temperature @xcite .",
    "because we do not resolve individual clumps , we are modeling the bulk properties that describe the sum of the @xmath7co emission .",
    "we calculate the luminosities using the sobolev escape probability approximation @xcite , where the expressions for the line luminosity , escape probability ( @xmath35 ) , and the sobolev optical depth ( @xmath36 ) take simple forms in the case of freely expanding supernova debris ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equations 5 - 9 ) .",
    "optically thin emission depends only on @xmath27 and @xmath28 , whereas at high optical depths , the line luminosity is described by the optically thick limit and depends only on @xmath29 and @xmath28 .    in the above model",
    ", we assume that the lines are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with their surroundings and the populations of the rotational levels are described by an excitation temperature equal to the kinetic temperature , @xmath28 .",
    "the higher - j transitions are less likely to be in lte ; radiative decays tend to depopulate higher - j rotational levels . in general , the population levels and line luminosities will depend on the product of the collision partner density ( likely oxygen , carbon , o@xmath37 and other @xmath7co molecules ) and collision rate coefficients , which are unknown for these species . to make a rough estimate",
    ", we examined the collisional rate coefficients for h@xmath37 + co @xcite , h + co @xcite , and h@xmath37o + co @xcite .",
    "the critical densities for the j=2 - 1 line are one to two orders of magnitude below the modeled density of the o / c clumps ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath38 @xmath39 at 25 years ) , indicating that these lines are well approximated by lte .",
    "the rate cofficients for the proxy species vary significantly for the higher - j lines , introducing considerable uncertainties in modeling the level populations .",
    "therefore , the lte predictions for the spectral line energy distributions ( sleds , as shown in figure [ fig : sled ] ) should be considered upper limits for lines above j=3 - 2 ; the actual line luminosities for the same physical conditions will be lower .",
    "this means that the current spire upper limits can not constrain the physical parameters of our model , but the j=6 - 5 and 7 - 6 detections can exclude parameters that predict low lte luminosities .",
    "we first consider the fluxes of the @xmath7co j=1 - 0 and 2 - 1 lines measured by the alma , which are in lte .",
    "we can determine a robust lower limit to the mass by assuming that the j= 1 - 0 line is optically thin , which yields @xmath40 m@xmath0  at @xmath41 k. however , the line luminosity ratio @xmath42 is not consistent with the ratio @xmath43 20 expected in the optically thin case .",
    "instead , it is consistent with the ratio of 8 expected in the optically thick case ( @xmath44 j@xmath45 ) in the rayleigh - jeans approximation , valid for temperatures above 10 k. this case , @xmath46 , defines an upper limit to the line emission because the specific intensity of radiation emitted by a surface can not exceed the planck function , @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath7co j=3 - 2 line is probably also optically thick ; assuming so , we predict a luminosity of @xmath48 ergs@xmath3 and a peak flux of 65 mjy , lower than the upper limit from apex .",
    "as mentioned , for a freely expanding volume , the resulting value of @xmath46 depends only on the net _ volume _ , @xmath29 , of the emitting material and the excitation temperature , independent of @xmath27 .",
    "the product of @xmath28 and @xmath29 is @xmath49 cm@xmath45 k.    figure [ fig : sled ] shows the alma and spire line luminosities from this work along with example sleds ( labeled a , b , and c ) , all of which are consistent with the alma measurements , despite arising from very different physical conditions .",
    "we can not constrain the mass from optically thick emission , but we can find a minimum mass at which the emission is optically thick and reproduces the alma observations . for all combinations of temperature and @xmath51 , the minimum mass is 0.01 m@xmath0  ( 3@xmath52 lower limit ) .    though the spire lines can not be modeled accurately",
    ", we can rule out any parameter space whose lte luminosity does not reach the lower limits of the two measured lines . in figure",
    "[ fig : sled ] , the lower limits are given by the spire measurements minus 2@xmath52 ( upward arrows ) .",
    "the parameter space excluded by the spire lines is highlighted by the dark gray region , clearly excluding low-@xmath28 and high-@xmath33 solutions .",
    "the light gray region shows possible sleds allowed by the alma , apex , and spire measurements and contains only temperatures greater than 14 k and filling factors less than 0.35 ; the minimum mass to satisfy these conditions is still 0.01 m@xmath0 .",
    "from the above analysis , the c / o clumps in sn1987a contain at least @xmath53 m@xmath0  of @xmath7co , an order of magnitude greater than measured in the first few years after the explosion @xcite .",
    "the implication is that @xmath7co has continued to form over the past 25 years . according to a model of the evolution of the optical and near - ir emission line spectrum @xcite at @xmath54 years",
    ", the carbon / oxygen clumps have a mass of carbon plus oxygen of 0.58 m@xmath0  and a filling factor @xmath55 .",
    "such a small filling factor would imply a higher @xmath7co temperature ( @xmath56 k ) and at least 0.2 m@xmath0  of @xmath7co ( 1@xmath52 lower limit ) .",
    "other studies have specifically examined molecule formation within the distinct chemical zones of the ejecta .",
    "for example , a 15 m@xmath0  progenitor at solar metallicity may form @xmath57 m@xmath0  of @xmath7co , a significant amount of which is formed as early as 600 days after the explosion @xcite . as the progenitor of sn1987a is most likely a 19 @xmath4 3 m@xmath0  blue giant with metallicity similar to the large magellanic cloud ( * ? ? ? * solar ) , we can also compare to results from population iii stars ( with zero metallicity ) .",
    "@xcite found similar results for a pop iii 20 m@xmath0  progenitor , estimating 0.27 m@xmath0  of @xmath7co produced on the same timescale .",
    "the velocity adopted for the co model presented here matches that used in the @xcite study ( 2242 km s@xmath3 ) . though our observations alone can provide only a minimum mass , the combination of the alma spectra results with the model computed by @xcite is consistent with theoretical models of molecule formation that have been untested until now .",
    "in addition to the lower limits for temperature and mass , _ herschel_-spire provides an upper limit to the total @xmath7co luminosity .",
    "recently , using the photometric capability of _ herschel _ ( 100 - 500 @xmath6 m ) , the far - ir luminosity of the debris of sn1987a was measured to be 8.45 @xmath58 erg s@xmath3 , and was attributed to thermal emission radiated by a massive reservoir of cold dust grains in the ejecta by @xcite .",
    "the lack of detection with spire fts in the same wavebands provides an upper limit to the contribution from rotationally excited @xmath7co molecules to the far - ir luminosity , with @xmath7co contributing at most 8.4% .",
    "this demonstrates that emission from dust grains is still the most viable explanation for the excess fir emission detected with _",
    "we have presented measurements for four @xmath7co rotational transitions in the ejecta of sn1987a , as well as upper limits for eight additional lines .",
    "the unprecedented angular resolution of alma firmly locates this emission as originating from the inner ejecta .",
    "the j=2 - 1 and j=1 - 0 lines are optically thick and require at least 0.01 m@xmath0  of @xmath7co .",
    "these results , combined with previous dust results from _ herschel _ , illustrate a sn environment filled with cool molecules and gas merely 25 years after the explosion .",
    "these results are not only the first of their kind , they are also exciting as a demonstration for future work . unlike optical observations , where the redshifted emission is largely obscured by dust , ( sub)millimeter observations can see the entire velocity range of the debris .",
    "surfaces of constant doppler shift are planar sections of the freely expanding sn debris , and the @xmath7co lines are sufficiently bright that we will be able to image the debris in 3 dimensions with resolution better than 0.02  through doppler tomography with the full alma array @xcite .",
    "alma will be able to do the same with different molecules ( e.g. sio ) to probe chemically distinct regions , which likely have different morphologies .",
