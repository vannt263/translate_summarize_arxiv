    "interplay between ferromagnetism and superconductivity in layered structures has attracted a great interest in the last years . in a rough approximation ,",
    "these states are antagonistic to each other and the ferromagnetism , being usually much stronger than superconductivity , is supposed to destroy the latter .",
    "however , in many cases the coexistence of these two phenomena is possible , even if the superconducting critical temperature @xmath14 is by order of magnitude lower than the curie temperature of the ferromagnet .",
    "such is the case when dealing with superconductor - ferromagnet ( s / f ) hybrid structures . in these systems",
    "the mutual interaction of these two states may lead to significant changes of the thermodynamic and transport properties .",
    "in particular for s / f / s systems in equilibrium , one of the most interesting effects is a phase shift by @xmath15 between weakly coupled superconductors , the so called @xmath15-state .",
    "the possibility of the @xmath15 -state in s / f / s structures was first predicted by bulaevskii et al . @xcite and studied in later works @xcite.the transition to the @xmath15-state manifests itself in a nonmonotonic ( and even oscillatory ) thickness dependence either of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath16 or of the critical current @xmath13 , and in the change of sign of @xmath13 if the exchange field @xmath3 exceeds a certain value in the s / f / s junction ( refs.@xcite ) .",
    "although some experiments on the thickness dependence of @xmath16 in s / f structures show that for a certain thickness of the f layer , the ground state of the system may correspond to the @xmath15-phase shift between the adjacent superconductors ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) , this kind of coupling was not observed in other experiments(see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . only recently , the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite on the measurement of the current @xmath17 in the _ @xmath18 _",
    "josephson junction demonstrated unambiguously the transition from the @xmath19 to the @xmath15-phase difference between the superconductors .    in all theoretical works @xcite ,",
    "calculations were performed either in the diffusive limit , in which the usadel equation was applicable , or in the pure ballistic limit , where the elastic scattering by impurities was completely neglected . at the same time , very often the parameters characterizing the samples in experiments , such as the sample size , the mean free path or the strength of the exchange field , do not correspond to these limits .",
    "therefore , there is a certain need to study the josephson current in the s / f / s structures not only in extreme limits but also in the intermediate region of the parameters .    in this work ,",
    "we calculate the critical josephson currents @xmath13 in a s / f / s junction for arbitrary impurity concentrations . since the approach based on the usadel equation @xcite ( dirty limit ) is valid only if the parameter @xmath20 is small ( @xmath3 is the exchange field of the ferromagnet and @xmath21 is the momentum relaxation time ) , we use in an arbitrary case the more general eilenberger equation @xcite",
    "in which , generally speaking , the elastic collision integral is not neglected .",
    "as mentioned above , in real experiments the parameter @xmath20 may take different values depending on the sample and therefore our theory can serve as a good description of the experiments .",
    "moreover , in all theoretical works mentioned previously , it was assumed that the magnetic ordering in the ferromagnetic layers was homogeneous . however , ferromagnetic materials exhibit generally more complex magnetic structures . in strong ferromagnets , like fe or ni ,",
    "the magnetic ground state consists of homogeneously magnetized domains with different relative orientations .",
    "also `` weak '' ferromagnets , like some ternary compounds with a regular lattice of rare earths elements , turn out to be superconducting as the crystals undergo a transition into a state with a nonhomogeneous ( helicoidal ) magnetic order ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a similar nonhomogeneous structure may arise in bilayered s / f structures .",
    "for example , an experiment @xcite and two theoretical works @xcite suggested a possible existence of a nonhomogeneous magnetic ordering in the ferromagnetic layer in a s / f system . also in experiments on giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) in magnetic multilayers employing superconducting contacts , nonhomogeneous magnetic structures can be created artificially ( see e.g. the review ref.@xcite and references therein ) .    in spite of the importance for the experiments , a theoretical analysis of the influence of a nonhomogeneous magnetization on the properties of s / f junctions is still lacking .",
    "therefore , the second goal of this paper is to investigate the influence of nonhomogeneous magnetic configurations on the supercurrent through different kinds of superconductor - ferromagnet josephson junctions .    in sec .",
    "[ section_sfs ] we consider a s / f / s system , with an nonuniform ( spiral ) magnetic ordering .",
    "we derive an expression for the critical current @xmath22 , where @xmath11 is the wave vector of the spiral magnetic order .",
    "we show that , whereas for @xmath10 the transition from the @xmath19-phase state to the @xmath23-phase state is possible , even small nonzero @xmath11 values may restore the @xmath19-phase state provided that the temperature is not too low .",
    "the reason for this is the existence of a triplet component of the superconducting condensate in the ferromagnet due to the proximity effect and the nonhomogeneous magnetic structure . in the limit @xmath24",
    "this component does not decay over the short distance @xmath25 , which corresponds to the length of decay of the usual singlet component , surviving up to a much longer distance @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "the influence of this triplet component on the transport properties of the s / f mesoscopic structures was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in sec .",
    "[ section_sfisf ] , we analyze the dc josephson current in a tunnel junction composed either of two s / f bilayers or of two magnetic superconductors .",
    "we derive an expression for the critical current @xmath13 as a function of the relative angle @xmath28 between the magnetization of both f layers .",
    "the most important and surprising result is that for an antiferromagnetic configuration , @xmath29 , the current @xmath13 increases with increasing exchange field @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated dependence of @xmath13 on various parameters allows us to make some conclusions not only on the magnetic order of the ferromagnetic materials used in s / f structures but also on nonhomogeneous superconducting states predicted by fulde , ferrel , larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite .    in sec.v",
    "we show that a meissner current is induced in the f - region due to the internal magnetic field of the ferromagnet .",
    "the meissner current density has a different sign at different points , and the total current in the ferromagnet is either diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending on the thickness @xmath30 of the f film .    in the appendix we present the derivation of the main equations used in this article .",
    "all our calculations are based on the eilenberger@xcite or on the usadel@xcite equations , generalized to the case of a spin - dependent interaction varying in space .",
    "another approach based mainly on the bogolyubov - de gennes equations was widely used for the study of the spin - injection from a ferromagnet into unconventional superconductors ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite and references therein ) . in the present work ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of conventional superconductors with s - wave pairing .",
    "in this section we calculate the dc josephson current @xmath31 in a s / f / s structure . in order to make the consideration as general as possible we use the eilenberger equation @xcite including the elastic collision term .",
    "this allows us to calculate @xmath31 for an arbitrary impurity concentration and to formulate conditions under which the ballistic or diffusive limits can be obtained . in order to find the condensate green s function @xmath32 in the f region in an analytical form , we assume that the proximity effect is weak , _ i.e. _ @xmath33 , and linearize the collision term in the eilenberger equation",
    "this assumption can be reasonable for structures with a big mismatch between the fermi surfaces in f and s , which leads to a small transmission coefficient @xmath34 through the s / f interface .",
    "if the coefficient @xmath34 is of the order of unity , we hope that our results are valid at least qualitatively .",
    "we consider the s / f / s structure shown in fig .",
    "1 and assume that the exchange energy @xmath3 is homogeneous in the f region ( the case of a non - homogeneous @xmath3 will be analyzed in the next section ) . because of the small interface transparency one can neglect the suppression of the order parameter @xmath35 in the superconductor due to the proximity of the ferromagnet .",
    "we assume also that there are no spin - flip processes in the ferromagnetic region , _ i.e. _ the spin - relaxation length is larger than the thickness @xmath30 of the ferromagnet and there are no spin - processes at the s / f interface .",
    "the linearized eilenberger equation in the matsubara representation has the following form @xmath36    here @xmath37 is the pauli matrix , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the angle between the momentum and the @xmath40-axis , @xmath41 is the mean free path , and @xmath42 is the matsubara frequency .",

    "thus , we have shown that the system of fig.7 and that of ref .",
    "@xcite are equivalent .",
    "however the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did not consider some interesting properties of such structures .",
    "we note that the same structure was also analyzed in ref.@xcite , where the critical current was calculated for different s / f interface transparencies .",
    "the authors have found the conditions under which the system undergoes a transition to the @xmath15 state ; however they analyzed only the case of parallel magnetization .",
    "here we consider two limiting cases : a ) a parallel relative orientation of the magnetizations , i.e. @xmath219 and b ) an antiparallel orientation : @xmath220 .    in the case",
    "@xmath219 according to eq .",

    "( [ crit_curr_para ] ) we assumed that @xmath222 and @xmath223 are the same in both bilayers ( symmetric structure ) .",
    "the dependence of the critical current on the exchange field @xmath222 was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . at @xmath224",
    "the current @xmath13 is constant up to the value @xmath225 where it drops to zero ; @xmath226 is the effective energy gap @xmath227 at zero temperature and zero exchange field .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the order parameter @xmath228 is also constant .",
    "we do not consider here a possible transition to the loff phase predicted by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite and fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite for the region @xmath229 .",
    "we argue that since the homogeneous superconducting state in this region is a metastable state , its realization is possible .",
    "nevertheless our result is definitely valid for the region of small @xmath222 , and a possible transition to the loff would manifest itself in a drop of the the critical current .",
    "more interesting is the case when the relative orientation of the magnetizations is antiparallel , i.e. @xmath230 then , the critical current is given by the expression @xmath231 in this case the dependence of @xmath13 on @xmath222 is completely different from that given by eq .",
    "( [ crit_curr_para ] ) . the critical current determined by eq .",

    "the dependence of @xmath234 on @xmath3 was presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the critical current has a maximum at some value of @xmath235 close to @xmath226 . with decreasing @xmath34 the maximum value of @xmath13 increases and its position is shifted towards @xmath226 . for arbitrary relative orientations of magnetizations",
    "the expression for @xmath236 can be presented in the form @xmath237 therefore , the singular part is always present and its contribution reaches 100% at @xmath29 .",
    "all the conclusions given above remain valid also for two magnetic superconductors with uniformly oriented magnetizations in each layer .",
    "we note that in contrast to the case of the spiral structure analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , no @xmath15-state appears in our model for any effective exchange field @xmath238 ( at larger @xmath222 the superconductivity is destroyed ) . as in the previous case of parallel orientations ,",
    "the state with @xmath239 might be unreachable for the antiparallel orientation due to the appearance of the inhomogeneous loff state .",
    "however the singular behavior of @xmath13 can be realized at smaller values of @xmath3 in a structure with large enough s / f interface resistance @xmath240 . in this case",
    "the bulk properties of the s film are not changed by the proximity of the f film ( to be more precise the condition @xmath241 must be satisfied ; @xmath242 is the specific resistance of the f film ) .",

    "in the preceding sections we have presented the formulae for the condensate function @xmath47 ( or @xmath121 ) in the ferromagnetic regions induced by the proximity effect .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath47 is determined by the interface transparency , _",
    "i.e. _ by the parameter @xmath115 , and the penetration length depends essentially on the parameter @xmath20 . the internal magnetic field @xmath83 of the ferromagnet , induces screening currents and leads to some suppression of the condensate function .",
    "we have neglected this suppression due to meissner currents ( orbital effects ) . in order to understand why this approximation can be justified we estimate now the magnitude of these effects .    in the dirty limit the depairing rate due to meissner",
    "current is determined by the energy @xmath246 , where @xmath247 is the condensate momentum , @xmath248 is the vector potential and @xmath249 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the depairing factor can be neglected in the usadel equation provided the condition @xmath250 is satisfied .",
    "for example , for @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253cm / s and @xmath254 we obtain @xmath255mk .",
    "if the condition eq .",

    "the meissner currents arise in the f region . in order to analyze this issue in more detail",

    "if we consider the diffusive regime , the condensate function can be found as it was done in section ii or directly from the usadel equation . in this limit ( @xmath79 )",

    "it is seen that the total current also changes sign , _",
    "i.e. _ in the ferromagnetic film either a diamagnetic or paramagnetic current is induced depending on the relation between @xmath30 and @xmath266 .    in the analysis presented here",
    "it was assumed that the exchange field @xmath3 is homogeneous . in a multidomain",
    "ferromagnet one expects a more complicated spatial distribution of the meissner current .",
    "we analyzed specific features of a supercurrent in superconductor / ferromagnet structures . in section",
    "ii we have calculated the josephson current @xmath31 in a s / f / s junction .",
    "it turns out that the product @xmath20 of the splitting energy @xmath3 and the momentum relaxation time @xmath21 is an important parameter , which determines the approach to be used in the problem . in the dirty limit , i.e. when",
    "@xmath79 , @xmath31 can be obtained from the usadel equation ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this limit",
    ", the change of sign of the critical current @xmath13 occurs if the thickness of the f layer @xmath30 is of the order of @xmath169 .",
    "the condensate function in the f layer decays exponentially over the length @xmath267 and undergoes oscillations with the same period . in the opposite limit ( @xmath99 ) the condensate function oscillates in space with the period @xmath268 ( as in the pure ballistic case considered in ref.@xcite ) and decays exponentially on the mean free path @xmath7 . the critical current @xmath13 decreases with @xmath3 as a power - law function and is not exponentially small if @xmath269 .",
    "we have also studied the influence of different inhomogeneous magnetic structures on the critical current through s / f structures . in section iii",
    "we considered a s / f / s sandwich with an inhomogeneous magnetic order in the f layer described by a vector @xmath11 . in the case",
    "@xmath10 we obtained the well - known transition from the @xmath19-phase to the @xmath15-phase state .",
    "we have also shown that even for small values of @xmath11 and not too low temperatures this transition may not take place ( fig.6 ) .",
    "the reason for a qualitative change of the @xmath245 is a long - range term in the singlet component of the condensate function @xmath185 .",
    "this term arises together with the triplet component if @xmath11 differs from zero .",
    "the long - range part of @xmath185 decays in the f film on a length of the order @xmath270 , which can be much longer than the characteristic length ( @xmath271 ) of the decay of @xmath185 in a homogeneous f layer ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "our results may be applied to ferromagnets containing domain walls and magnetic multilayers with nonhomogeneous magnetic structures .",
    "we used the quasiclassical green s function approach to describe such structures in a quantitative way . in section",
    "iv it was shown that for an antiferromagnetic configuration in the s / f - i - s / f junction , the dependence @xmath272 shows an anomalous behavior : the critical current increases with increasing @xmath3 or @xmath273 .",
    "this means that the josephson critical current in a junction formed by two ferromagnet - superconductor bilayers may be even larger than the critical current in a similar josephson junction s / i / s . in the last section we have considered a s / f bilayer structure .",
    "the meissner currents which are spontaneously excited due to the internal field of the ferromagnetic film have been calculated .",
    "the current density oscillates along the @xmath40-axis and the total meissner current in the f film may be either diamagnetic or paramagnetic depending on the thickness @xmath30 and on the exchange field @xmath3 .",
    "all the effects analyzed in our work can be verified experimentally .",
    "we thank sfb 491 _ magnetische heterostrukturen _ for financial support .",
    "in this part we present some general formulae for superconductivity in the presence of an exchange field .",
    "we consider structures in which the superconducting pairing and the exchange interaction of electrons with ordered , localized magnetic moments take place .",

    "the notation @xmath280 , @xmath281 means inversion of both spin and momentum .",
    "the order parameter @xmath228 must be determined self - consistently . in order to define the green s function in a customary way we introduce new operators @xmath282 and @xmath283 , which are related to the creation and anhilation operators @xmath284 and @xmath285 by the relation ( we drop the index @xmath286 related to the momentum )",
