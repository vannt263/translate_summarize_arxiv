    "recently , ishida et al . have proposed the covariant @xmath3-classification scheme of hadrons@xcite , which gives covariant quark representations for composite hadrons with definite lorentz and chiral transformation properties .",
    "the @xmath3-classification scheme has a unitary symmetry in the hadron rest frame , called `` static @xmath6 symmetry''@xcite , embedded in the covariant @xmath3-representation space , of which tensors can be decomposed into representations of @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the pseudounitary homogeneous lorentz group for dirac spinors .",
    "the static @xmath6 contains the dirac spin group @xmath9 in its subgroups and @xmath9 contains two @xmath10 subgroups as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the spin groups concerning the boosting and intrinsic - spin rotation , respectively , of constituent quarks , being connected with decomposition of dirac @xmath14-matrices , @xmath15 .",
    "thus the static @xmath6 symmetry includes the chiral @xmath16 symmetry as @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath3-classification scheme is able to incorporate effectively the effects of chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking , essential for understanding of properties of the low - lying hadrons , into what is called a constituent quark model .",
    "an essential feature of the @xmath3-classification scheme is to have the static @xmath9 symmetry for light @xmath18 quarks confined inside hadrons .",
    "the degree of freedom on the @xmath19-spin , being indispensable for covariant description of spin @xmath20 particles , offers a basis to define the rule of chiral transformation for quark - composite hadrons . since we have the @xmath19-spin degree of freedom , which is discriminated by the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , in addition to the ordinary @xmath23-spin , the ground states of light - quark @xmath24 mesons are composed of eight @xmath25 multiplets with respective @xmath26 quantum numbers , two pseudoscalars @xmath27 , two scalars @xmath28 , two vectors @xmath29 , and two axial - vectors @xmath30 ( n and e denoting `` normal '' and `` extra '' ) , where each n ( e ) even - parity multiplet is the chiral partner of the corresponding n ( e ) odd - parity multiplet and they form linear representations of the chiral symmetry .",
    "since the eigenstates only with the @xmath21-eigenvalue @xmath31 are taken for heavy quarks , we have for heavy - light meson systems two heavy - spin multiplets , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which are the chiral partner each other , while for heavy - heavy meson systems we have the same @xmath32-spin multiplets as in the conventional nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "we try to assign some of the observed mesons to the predicted @xmath24 multiplets , resorting to their @xmath26 quantum numbers and masses .",
    "the observed meson data are taken from the particle data group 2004 edition@xcite , except for the following mesons :    * @xmath34 .",
    "there are several experimental indications of the existence of the @xmath34 reported by the obelix@xcite and lass@xcite collaborations , and others .",
    "particle listings and the `` note on the @xmath35 '' in @xcite . ] * @xmath36 . the existence of @xmath36 is claimed in the analysis of the @xmath37 cross section by the snd collaboration@xcite .",
    "we accept the existence of these vector mesons as true@xcite .",
    "the resulting assignments , though some of them are ambiguous , are shown in table 1 .        here",
    "we make some comments on these assignments .    1 .",
    "the light scalar mesons @xmath38 are assined to the @xmath39-nonet as a chiral partner of the @xmath40-meson @xmath41-nonet .",
    "the low - mass vector mesons @xmath42 are assined to the @xmath43-nonet as a chiral partner of the @xmath44-nonet @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "the axial - vector mesons @xmath48 are assined to the @xmath49-nonet as a chiral partner of the @xmath50-meson @xmath51-nonet .",
    "the recent observed mesons @xmath52 are assined to the @xmath33 multiplet as a chiral partner of the @xmath32 multiplet @xmath53@xcite .",
    "these newly observed mesons , together with the @xmath23-meson nonet , are the best candidates for the hadronic states with @xmath54 whose existence is expected in the @xmath3 scheme .",
    "it is noted that the normal ( n ) and extra ( e ) states with the same @xmath26 generally mix together due to the spontaneous as well as explicit breaking of chiral symmetry and some other mechanism .",
    "in the @xmath3-classification scheme heavy - light @xmath55 meson fields , aside from the internal space - time wave functions , are given by @xmath56 with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represent the local fields for the @xmath59 mesons with @xmath60 , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the four - momentum ( mass ) of meson fields , and flavor indices are omitted for simplicity . to describe the light - quark pseudoscalar and scalar mesons together with the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry",
    ", we adopt the @xmath63 linear sigma model , introducing the chiral field @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 with @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) are the scalar ( pseudoscalar ) fields .",
    "we now write a chiral - symmetric effective lagrangian which gives the chiral mass splitting between the heavy - light @xmath70 and @xmath4 multiplets through the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry@xcite : @xmath71 \\label{eq : lnd},\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the dimensionless coupling constant of yukawa interaction in the nonderivative form and the trace is taken over the spinor and flavor indices .",
    "when the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken , @xmath73 has the vacuum expectation value , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are related to the pion and kaon decay constants by @xmath77 then the mass splitting between the two multiplets is induced and the mass differences @xmath78 are given by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which leads to the relation @xmath81 from this relation with the experimental values@xcite , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 and consequently predict the masses @xmath85 for the @xmath4 @xmath5 mesons , using the measured mass values@xcite of the @xmath86 and @xmath87 mesons .",
    "we hereafter refer to these predicted mesons , respectively , as `` @xmath88 '' and `` @xmath89 '' .",
    "we could ask experimental data whether there was some evidence for the existence of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . here",
    "we check on the recent published data on the @xmath90 and @xmath91 mass distributions in @xmath92 , @xmath93 decays from the belle@xcite and babar@xcite collaborations .    * * @xmath90 mass spectrum * : in the belle data mass distribution in figure 3 of @xcite .",
    "] we see an excess of events , a single data point of 20 mev bin , at a mass of 2.13 gev near the predicted mass of the @xmath88 , and so might regard it as an indication of that resonance , though it is natural to think that its data point should be within a statistical error . on the other hand , it would seem to us that the babar data mass distribution in figure 3 ( right ) of @xcite . ] around a mass of 2.1 gev show a typical pattern of interference between two or more resonances . * * @xmath94 mass spectrum * : in the belle data mass distribution in figure 9 of @xcite . ]",
    "there is also an excess of events , a single data point of 10 mev bin , at a mass of 2.255 gev near the predicted mass of the @xmath89 , and so it might be an indication of the resonance . although it is not clear , the babar data mass distribution in figure 3 ( left ) of @xcite . ] around a mass of 2.26 gev might show a typical pattern of interference .",
    "if the @xmath88 and @xmath89 resonances really exist , their widths have to be narrow , @xmath95 mev , judging from the data mentioned above .",
    "the dominant decay modes of these resonances are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , and thus we examine their single pion transitions . to estimate the widths of @xmath96 and @xmath97 decays , together with @xmath98 , we set up , in addition to the nonderivative interaction @xmath99 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnd ] ) , the chiral - invariant effective interaction with the derivative form : @xmath100 \\label{eq : ld},\\ ] ] where @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the coupling constant with a dimension of @xmath103 , which is related to the axial coupling constant @xmath104 by @xmath105 .",
    "the pionic decay widths of the @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 states are derived from @xmath99 and @xmath109 , and the decay widths of @xmath107 and @xmath108 are identical . using the measured value of @xmath110   = 65 \\ \\mathrm{kev}$]@xcite and @xmath111 from @xmath112 ,",
    "the coupling @xmath102 is fixed to 3.96 gev@xmath113 ( corresponding to @xmath114 ) , and then we obtain @xmath115      = \\gamma [ d_{1}(2250 ) \\rightarrow d^ { * } + \\pi ]      \\approx 30 \\ \\mathrm{mev}.\\ ] ] this value is consistent with the speculated widths of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we have presented the possible assignments for some of the observed mesons in the covariant @xmath3-classification scheme .",
    "it is necessary and important to examine the strong- and radiative - decay@xcite properties of the assigned states in order to establish their assignments . on the basis of these assignments",
    "we have also predicted the existence of the low - mass @xmath4 @xmath5 mesons with narrow width , which might have been seen in the recent published data on the @xmath90 and @xmath91 mass distributions from the belle and babar collaborations ."
