    "the aim of this paper is to extend the results of nakanishi and naatanen @xcite to hyperbolic cone surfaces of signature @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a cone angle in the interval @xmath6 .",
    "our motivation for this is to understand geometrically the `` differential recurrences '' introduced by do and norbury @xcite . in",
    "particularly we want to see how the hyperbolic structure degenerates as the cone angle @xmath5 approaches @xmath2 .",
    "we use a different coordinate system to nakanishi and naatanen , who use traces of matrices , and maloni , palesi and tan @xcite also study the 4-holed sphere using similar ideas .",
    "each of our coordinates is a cross ratio and so our results should generalise to representations into higher rank groups as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the price to pay for this ( see section [ autos ] ) is that determining the action of the ( extended ) mapping class group is slightly more delicate in our coordinates . in the trace coordinates the generators are obtained via so - called root flipping or vieta jumping .",
    "finally we note that @xcite have a different approach , based on generalising quadratic differentials , to the problems posed by large cone angles .",
    "the main difficulty is that , although it is easy to construct a hyperbolic cone surfaces with this signature , it is not clear that given any other representation in the same component of the relative character variety that it is also the holonomy of a ( unique ) hyperbolic structure ( theorem [ metric ] ) .      as in @xcite , @xcite we consider a cone point on a hyperbolic surface @xmath7 to be a  generalized boundary component \" having purely imaginary length .    1 .",
    "if the surface @xmath7 has a single puncture and @xmath8 \\subset   \\fund(\\mm)$ ] represents a the boundary of a small embedded disc around the puncture then its teichmuller space embeds as a connected subset of the @xmath9-character variety of @xmath10 containing representations such that @xmath11 . by convention",
    "@xmath12 represents a boundary component of zero length .",
    "2 .   if @xmath7 has a single totally geodesic boundary component represented by a conjugacy class of loops @xmath8",
    "\\subset   \\fund(\\mm)$ ] , the space of marked hyperbolic structures on @xmath7 such that the boundary geodesic has length @xmath13 embeds in the @xmath9-character variety of its fundamental group . the image is a connected component of the _ relative @xmath9-character variety of @xmath10 _ , that is , the subvariety such that @xmath14 .",
    "3 .   if the puncture is  replaced \" by a single cone point of angle @xmath15 @xcite , one identifies the space of hyperbolic structures on the surface @xmath7 with a component of the @xmath9-character variety such that @xmath16 .",
    "it proves useful to adopt the convention that @xmath12 represents a boundary component of purely imaginary length @xmath17 .    in each of these three cases",
    "we say that @xmath12 is a",
    "_ generalized boundary component . _",
    "we consider representations @xmath18 obtained by deforming the holonomy of a metric on a surface with a single cone point of angle @xmath19 through representations such that @xmath20 .",
    "the set of such representation forms a subset of the @xmath9-character variety which we call a",
    "_ geometric component of the relative character variety_. note that , if @xmath21 then none of the representation @xmath18 of @xmath10 is discrete and faithful .",
    "consequently , we may not assume that given an essential simple loop @xmath22 and a representation @xmath18 the isometry @xmath23 will be hyperbolic .    with this in mind , our aim is to show that the geometric component of the relative character variety enjoys the following properties which should be familiar from the theory of teichmuller space ;    1 .",
    "every simple loop is hyperbolic .",
    "the action of the outer automorphism group of @xmath10 is proper .",
    "the set of lengths of simple loops has fibonnaci growth .",
    "every representation is the holonomy of a hyperbolic structure with a single cone point on a surface .",
    "the fundamental group of the four holed sphere is freely generated by three peripheral loops @xmath24 .",
    "after possibly replacing some of these elements by their inverses , we may assume that @xmath25 is also a peripheral element . throughout each of @xmath24",
    "will be either hyperbolic or parabolic element of @xmath9 with positive trace .",
    "on the other hand we impose no restriction on the type of @xmath12 but its trace will always be strictly greater than @xmath26 .",
    "we make the following definition : a component ( of the relative character variety @xmath27 constant ) is _ geometric _ iff it contains the holonomy of a metric of a cone surface . for example , if one takes @xmath28 then @xmath29 , the matrices @xmath30 are in the congruence subgroup @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the regular 4 punctured sphere .

    "every representation is the holonomy of a hyperbolic structure with a single cone point on a surface .",
    "if the four holed sphere is equipped with a complete hyperbolic metric , and the boundary @xmath12 is totally geodesic of lengths @xmath33 then the loops @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be represented by closed simple geodesics which meet in exactly two points and which satisfy @xmath36 this inequality follows almost immediately from the collar lemma but we will deduce it from a more general result which we explain now .    as discussed in the preceding paragraph , we view a three holed sphere with a single cone point of angle @xmath37 as a four holed sphere with a generalized boundary component , represented by an element @xmath38 such that @xmath39 under the hypothesis that @xmath40 , the elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 are always hyperbolic ( theorem [ thma ] ) so that there are real numbers @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and we prove    [ thmb ] with the above notation we have the following inequality @xmath43    it is worth taking a moment to consider the extremal cases @xmath44 :    * when @xmath45 this corresponds to a cone angle of zero , in other words a cusp , and we recover the inequality ( [ mmc2 ] ) above . * when @xmath46 one has @xmath47 so that , as one expects , the inequality is redundant .",
    "the essential motivation for this paper is understanding do and norbury s approach to volume recurrences and maloni , palesi and tan @xcite study the mapping class group action on the four holed sphere .",
    "nakanishi and naatanen determined the symplectic volume of the moduli spaces of the once holed torus @xmath48 and the 4 holed sphere @xmath49 .",
    "the volumes are quadratic polynomials in the lengths of the boundary components : @xmath50 their method consists of finding a fundamental region for the action of the mapping class group on the relative character variety when the peripheral loops are hyperbolic or possibly parabolic .",
    "they do this by imitating wolpert s @xcite analysis of the mapping class group action on the teichmuller space of the once punctured torus .",
    "do and norbury found a so - called differential relation which , in the simplest case , relates the volume of the moduli space of singular surface with a cone point to that of a smooth surface obtained by forgetting the cone point . for a 3 punctured sphere with a cone point of angle @xmath5 the volume of the moduli space is @xmath51 and we see that for @xmath46 the value of @xmath52 is @xmath1 which is the volume of the moduli space of the the 3-punctured sphere is @xmath1 .",
    "a more interesting case is that of the punctured torus with a single cone point of angle @xmath5 , the volume , computed by mirzakhani is :    @xmath53 so for @xmath46 the value of @xmath54 is a quartic in @xmath55 is _ not _ the volume of the moduli space of the one holed torus .",
    "however , if we take the derivative at @xmath56 we will recover the volume of the one holed torus as a factor : @xmath57    as mentioned above maloni , palesi and tan @xcite study the mapping class group action on the the ( relative ) @xmath58 character varieties of the four - holed sphere .",
    "they describe a domain of discontinuity , and , in the case of real characters , show that this domain of discontinuity may be non - empty on the components where the relative euler class is non - maximal .",
    "this is to be expected , at least heuristically , as the volume polynomial @xmath59 does not vanish on these non - maximal components .",
    "they should conjecturally decompose as a union of wandering domains and a set where the mapping class action is ergodic .",
    "our methods are based on elementary algebra and geometry .",
    "it is important , however , to recall some basic facts and definitions .",
    "recall that if @xmath60 then it acts on @xmath61 by mobius transformation @xmath62 the fixed points of moebius transformation are given by the following formula :    @xmath63    note further that , if @xmath64 is _ elliptic _ , that is @xmath65 , then @xmath66 are complex conjugate and @xmath67 on the othe hand if @xmath64 is _ hyperbolic _ , @xmath68 , then the fixed points are points of the extended real line @xmath69 .",
    "following the convention , one views a 3 punctured sphere with a single cone point as a _",
    "generalized 4 holed sphere _ that is a four holed sphere with three boundary components of length zero and a single generalized boundary component @xmath12 of purely imaginary length .",
    "the fundamental group @xmath10 of the 4 punctured sphere is freely generated by 3 peripheral loops @xmath24 .",
    "after possibly replacing some of these elements by their inverses , we may assume that @xmath25 is also a peripheral element and we have the presentation    @xmath70      we begin by studying the set of representations of @xmath71 .",
    "the group is freely generated by @xmath24 and we may define a representation @xmath72 by setting @xmath73 with @xmath74 parabolic with distinct fixed points . recall that an element of @xmath75 is _ parabolic _ iff it is conjugate to @xmath76 and that such a transformation has a single ( ideal ) fixed point in @xmath77 .",
    "the action of @xmath9 is transitive on triples of distinct points in @xmath77 and we normalize so that the fixed points of @xmath30 are respectively fixes @xmath78 .",
    "so that , for some @xmath79 @xmath80 since @xmath10 is freely generated by @xmath24 , the triple @xmath81 determines a point of the @xmath9 representation variety of @xmath10 and we denote @xmath82 $ ] the corresponding point in the character variety .",
    "thus we have a map from @xmath83 to the representation variety @xmath84 and from @xmath83 to the character variety @xmath85.\\ ] ] the traces of elements of @xmath86 form a natural class of functions on the representation variety and one can compute explicit expressions for these functions in terms of @xmath87 . for example",
    "@xmath88 so that @xmath89 likewise , by explicit computation , one has @xmath90 recall that an element of @xmath9 is hyperbolic iff @xmath91 . for all our representations @xmath92 ,",
    "so whenever @xmath93 is discrete , by the triple trace theorem @xcite , @xmath94 we shall consider non discrete representations @xmath18 but we will show ( lemma [ product ] ) that the inequality ( [ ttt ] ) still holds for all the representations considered provided @xmath95 .",
    "finally we check that our map gives a parameterization of the character variety :    the restriction of the map @xmath96 \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to @xmath97 is a diffeomorphism onto its image .",
    "it suffices to check that the map @xmath98 is a diffeomorphism .",

    "the surface @xmath102 has 3 ( and possibly 4 if @xmath103 is parabolic ) cusps , that is one for each of the ideal vertices of @xmath101 .",
    "each of the the edges of the triangle @xmath101 embeds as an arc joining distinct pairs of cusps and each of these cusps , by shimura s lemma , lies in one of 3 pairwise disjoint cusp regions of area 1 . in this paragraph",
    "we give an interpretation of @xmath87 in terms of this configuration .",
