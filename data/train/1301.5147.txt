    "there is a very close relation between open book decompositions and lefschetz fibrations over @xmath0 , with fibers surfaces with boundary .",
    "it is known that any open book decomposition is filled by a lefschetz fibration if its monodromy can be factorized as a product of positive dehn twists ( work of eliashberg , giroux , gompf , loi - piergallini , akbulut - ozbagci etc .",
    "see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , two fibrations filling the same open book are isomorphic if and only if the two such factorizations are hurwitz equivalent @xcite .    in the present work we consider lefschetz fibrations and open book decompositions on manifolds with a real structure .",
    "a _ real structure _ on an oriented @xmath1-manifold ( respectively @xmath2-manifold ) with boundary ( possibly empty ) is defined to be an involution which is orientation preserving and the fixed point set of which is of dimension @xmath3 ( respectively @xmath4 ) , if it is not empty .",
    "hence , if @xmath5 is the oriented boundary of an oriented @xmath1-manifold @xmath6 , a real structure on @xmath6 restricts to a real structure on @xmath5 .",
    "we call a manifold @xmath6 together with a real structure a _ real manifold _ and denote by @xmath7 the real structure on it .",

    "we answer a natural question that relates real open books and real lefschetz fibrations .",
    "we show that there is a lefschetz fibration that does not admit a real structure , while the canonical open book on its boundary is real .",

    "a _ genus-@xmath15 lefschetz fibration _ of @xmath16 is a proper smooth projection @xmath14 such that @xmath20 has only finitely many critical points in int(@xmath16 ) with pairwise distinct images around which one can choose complex charts such that the projection takes the form @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the inverse image of a regular value is a closed oriented smooth surface of genus  @xmath15 .",
    "it follows from the definition that if @xmath22 , then @xmath23 is a fiber bundle over @xmath24 .",
    "the notion of lefschetz fibration can be slightly generalized to cover the case of fibers with boundary .",
    "then @xmath16 turns into a manifold with corners and its boundary , @xmath25 , becomes naturally divided into two parts : @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in this case , if , in particular , @xmath28 , then @xmath25 admits a canonical open book decomposition with binding @xmath29 and projection @xmath30 .",
    "real lefschetz fibration _ is a fibration together with a pair of real structures @xmath17 and @xmath18 commuting with the fiber structure .",
    "it is known that around a singular fiber , lefschetz fibrations are determined by the monodromy that is a single positive dehn twist around a simple closed curve , the _ vanishing cycle_. algebraically , lefschetz fibrations over @xmath28 can be encoded by the factorization @xmath31 of the monodromy @xmath32 ( because of the composition notation the order is reversed ) along @xmath33 into a product of positive dehn twists considered up to hurwitz equivalence .",
    "namely , two such factorizations are called _ hurwitz equivalent _ if one can get from one factorization to the other by a finite sequence of hurwitz moves : @xmath34 and possibly a global conjugation .    in",
    "what follows , we consider a genus-@xmath4 lefschetz fibration @xmath35 with exactly two singular fibers .",
    "choose a base point @xmath36 and consider a basis @xmath37 of @xmath38 obtained by connecting the base point @xmath39 to the positively oriented simple loops , each surrounding the corresponding critical value once . fix an identification of @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "denote by @xmath42 , the class on @xmath43 of @xmath44 and by @xmath45 , the class of @xmath46 and consider the curves @xmath47 represented respectively by @xmath48 and @xmath42 on @xmath43 .",
    "we assume that the monodromy along @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given respectively by the positive dehn twists @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "in other words , the corresponding singular fibers are obtained from @xmath43 by pinching the curves @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the total monodromy of the fibration , thus , becomes the composition @xmath55 .",
    "recall that @xmath56 defines an isomorphism from the mapping class group @xmath57 ( the identity component of the space of diffeomorphisms ) of the torus to the group of automorphisms of @xmath58 .",
    "the latter is isomorphic to @xmath59=\\small{\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1{\\end{array}}\\right ] } , [ t_{b}]=\\small{\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr } 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1{\\end{array}}\\right ] } : \\begin{array}{ll } [ t_a][t_b ] [ t_a]= [ t_b][t_a][t_b]\\\\ ( [ t_a][t_b])^6=\\textrm{id } \\end{array }   \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 $ ] refers to the matrix representation of the automorphism @xmath61 . with respect to the above presentation , @xmath62=[t_{v}][t_{u}]$ ]",
    "is given by the matrix @xmath63}$ ] .",
    "_ proof : _ suppose that @xmath35 admits a real structure .",
    "that is to say , there exist real structures @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the critical points as well as their images are invariant under the action of the real structures @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively , so either they are both real or they are interchanged by the real structures . by definition of real lefschetz fibrations ,",
    "the decomposition @xmath70 associated to @xmath37 is hurwitz equivalent to a decomposition @xmath71 associated to @xmath72 .",
    "although , the positions of @xmath73 can be arbitrary with respect to the real structure @xmath69 , by conjugation by a power of @xmath74 ( such a conjugation preserves hurwitz classes ) and by moving , if necessary , the base point on the boundary , we can assume that we have only the two positions shown in figure  [ gamalar ] .",
    "in the former case ( the case shown on the left in figure  [ gamalar ] ) , the fiber @xmath75 can be endowed with a real structure @xmath76 by pulling a real structure on a real fiber between the two real singular fibers . up to isotopy , we can assume that vanishing cycles @xmath53 , @xmath54 are invariant under the action of the real structure @xmath76 .",
    "lemma  [ kesismelerencok2 ] concerns the intersection number of invariant curves and prohibits this case , ( since the intersection number of @xmath53 and @xmath54 is equal to 5 ) .",
    "now assume that critical points are exchanged by the real structure ( this is the case depicted on the right in figure  [ gamalar ] ) .",
    "let @xmath77 be the real structure conjugate to the inherited real structure on the base fiber @xmath75 .",
    "then , by the assumption we have @xmath78 ; as a consequence , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are elements of @xmath81 eigenspaces @xmath82 and , respectively , @xmath83 of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the primitive forms of the classes of @xmath79 and @xmath80 form a basis , respectively of @xmath85 and @xmath83 . moreover , for any real structure @xmath76 , the intersection number of the bases of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is at most 2 which is violated by our choice of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath88 +      _ proof : _ the real structure restricted to an invariant curve defines an action on the curve .",
    "this action can be the identity , a reflection or an antipodal involution ; let us call those curves a real curve , a reflection curve and an antipodal curve respectively .",
    "recall that up to equivariant diffeomorphisms , the real structure on a torus are distinguished by the number of real components that can be 0,1 or 2 . for each real structure",
    "we have    * if @xmath76 has no real components , then there exist two @xmath76-equivariant isotopy classes of antipodal curves and no classes of other types ; * if @xmath76 has one real component , then @xmath43 contains a unique @xmath76-equivariant isotopy class of non - contractible reflection curves , a unique class of antipodal curves , and a unique real curve ; * if @xmath76 has two real components , then @xmath43 contains no @xmath76-equivariant isotopy class of antipodal curves , a unique class of reflection curves , and two classes of real curves .",
    "the result follows from the following observations : a reflection curve has two real points , so the intersection with a real curve must be at 0 , 1 or 2 points .",
    "moreover , a reflection curve must intersect an antipodal curve at 0 or 2 points , and real curves and antipodal curves are disjoint . @xmath88",

    "* proposition  4 ) , it is enough to check whether its monodromy is real , i.e. it admits a decomposition into a product of two real structures . real structures on @xmath43 correspond to involutive elements of determinant @xmath90 in @xmath91 .",
    "here we have @xmath62=\\small{\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr}-39 & 25 \\\\ -25 & 16{\\end{array}}\\right]}=\\small{\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr}5 & -3 \\\\ 8 & -5{\\end{array}}\\right]\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr}-120 & 77 \\\\ -187 & 120{\\end{array}}\\right]}$ ] , a product of two involutive elements of determinant @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath88 +    in @xcite , an explicit classification of real elements of @xmath92 as well as a particular decomposition of a product of two real structures for each conjugacy class is given . according to (",
    "* proposition  4 ) , a hyperbolic element , i.e. an element with absolute value of trace greater than @xmath3 , of @xmath92 is real if and only if its _ cutting period cycle _ @xmath93 $ ] is odd - bipalindromic . for hyperbolic matrices ,",
    "the cutting period cycle together with the sign of the trace is a complete invariant of conjugacy classes and it can be recovered from the trace and the periodic tail of the continued fraction expansion of the slope of the eigenvectors . in our specific example the cutting period cycle of @xmath74 is found to be @xmath94 $ ] which is odd - bipalindromic , i.e. up to cyclic ordering , it has two palindromic pieces @xmath4 , @xmath95 of odd length .",
    "so far we have constructed a @xmath43-fibered lefschetz fibration can not be real while the @xmath43 bundle at its boundary is real .",
    "now we show that a similar construction can be cooked up to obtain a real open book at the boundary .",
    "denote by @xmath96 the lefschetz fibration with boundary obtained from @xmath64 above by taking out a neighborhood of a section .",
    "note that such a section always exists for genus  1 lefschetz fibrations @xcite .",
    "the regular fibers of @xmath97 are tori with one boundary component .",
    "the fibration @xmath97 has no real structure , since otherwise @xmath20 would have one .",
    "however , we have :      _ proof : _ as a consequence of lemma  1 in @xcite it is enough to show that the monodromy of @xmath99 is real .",
    "note that the monodromy of @xmath99 is an element of @xmath100 , the group of relative isotopy classes of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms which are identity on the boundary .",
    "the crucial observation is that being real in @xmath57 is equivalent to being real in @xmath100 .",
    "namely , there is a short exact sequence @xmath101 given by the central extension of @xmath57 , where @xmath102 is the dehn twist along the boundary component .",
    "obviously , images of real elements of @xmath100 are real .",
    "for the converse , suppose im@xmath62=[c][c']$ ] for some @xmath62\\in { \\textup{map}(t^2 \\smallsetminus \\textup{int}{d^2 } , \\partial)}$ ] and real structures @xmath103,[c ' ] \\in { \\textup{gl(2,\\,${\\mathbb{z}}$)}}$ ] .",
    "if necessary , by replacing @xmath76 by @xmath104 and @xmath105 by @xmath106 for some diffeomorphism @xmath15 , we can assume that @xmath76 and hence @xmath105 leaves @xmath107 invariant .",
    "we have @xmath108 .",
    "thus @xmath109 is a real structure which we denote by @xmath110 . as @xmath62=[c][c'][t_{\\partial}]^k$ ] ,",

    "[ baskaikiliyok ] up to isomorphism preserving the identification @xmath113 , there are exactly two lefschetz fibrations with exactly two singular fibers filling the canonical open book on @xmath114 ; moreover , neither of the fibrations admit a real structure .    _",
    "proof : _ let @xmath115 be two simple curves on @xmath43 such that @xmath116 .",
    "we have @xmath62=[t_{v}][t_{u}]=\\small{\\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr}-39 & 25 \\\\ -25 & 16{\\end{array}}\\right]}$ ] .",
    "suppose @xmath117 is the curve defined by @xmath118 , then a simple calculation gives @xmath119= \\small { \\left[{\\begin{array}}{rr } 1-\\alpha\\beta & \\alpha^2 \\\\ -\\beta^2 & 1+\\alpha\\beta { \\end{array}}\\right]}$ ] .",
    "all dehn twists are represented by matrices whose traces have absolute value equal to @xmath3 . therefore , from @xmath120 = [ t_{v'}^{-1 } f]$ ] , we get the identity @xmath121 .",

    "note that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are in the solution set .",
    "note also that @xmath125 , the curves with class @xmath45 and @xmath126 respectively , are in the solution set too .",
    "the pairs @xmath127 and @xmath128 are not hurwitz equivalent .",
    "indeed in that case there would be an invertible matrix @xmath129 with determinant 1 , such that either @xmath130 [ t_{v}][t_{u } ] k=[t_{u ' } ] \\mbox { and } k^{-1 } [ t_{u } ] k=[t_{v'}]\\ ] ] or @xmath131 [ t_{u}][t_{v } ] k=[t_{u ' } ]   \\mbox { and } k^{-1 } [ t_{v } ] k=[t_{v'}].\\ ] ] however , by straightforward calculation one can show that there exists no such @xmath129 .",
