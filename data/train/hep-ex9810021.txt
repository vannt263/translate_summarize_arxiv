    "we describe measurements and searches using a data sample of photonic events with large missing energy collected in 1997 with the opal detector at lep .",
    "the events result from @xmath11 collisions at centre - of - mass energies of 130.0 , 136.0 and 182.7  gev with integrated luminosities of 2.35 , 3.37 and 54.5  pb@xmath58 , respectively .",
    "the present paper complements our recent publication of results from earlier data samples @xcite consisting of a total of 25  pb@xmath58 at centre - of - mass energies of 130 , 136 , 161 and 172  gev .",
    "results on photonic events without missing energy at @xmath59 183  gev are presented in a separate paper@xcite .",
    "recent measurements of photonic event production have also been made by the other lep collaborations at centre - of - mass energies above the w pair threshold  @xcite , including new results at @xmath59 183  gev  @xcite .",
    "related searches in @xmath60 collisions have been reported in  @xcite .",
    "the interest in the 1997 data is twofold .",
    "the main motivation is that the large data set at a higher centre - of - mass energy ( 183 gev ) gives discovery potential in a new kinematic regime .",
    "additionally , the lower energy data sets allow the experiment at 130 and 136 gev to be repeated leading to a check of our previous results which indicated an excess of events with acoplanar photons  @xcite .",
    "the single - photon and acoplanar - photons search topologies presented here are designed to select events with one or more photons and significant missing transverse energy , indicating the presence of at least one neutrino - like invisible particle which interacts only weakly with matter .",
    "the event selections for these search topologies are similar to those used in our recent publication@xcite .",
    "the main changes are improvements in the rejection of backgrounds from cosmic ray interactions which allow for an increased kinematic acceptance of the single - photon topology .",
    "the single - photon search topology is sensitive to neutral events in which there are one or two photons and missing energy which , within the standard model , are expected from the @xmath61 process .",
    "the allowance for two observed photons retains acceptance for doubly radiative neutrino pair production .",
    "the acoplanar - photons search topology is designed to select neutral events with two or more photons and significant missing transverse energy which , within the standard model , are expected from the @xmath62 process .",
    "the selection is designed to retain acceptance for events with three photons , if the system formed by the three photons shows evidence for significant missing transverse energy .",
    "these photonic final - state topologies are sensitive to new physics of the type @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 is neutral and decays radiatively ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath5 is stable and only weakly interacting . for the general case of massive @xmath65 and @xmath5 this includes conventional supersymmetric processes@xcite @xmath67 . in this context",
    "it has been emphasized @xcite that the radiative branching ratio of the @xmath68 may be large .",
    "these topologies also have particularly good sensitivity for the special case of @xmath69 .",
    "this applies both to the production of excited neutrinos @xmath70 and to supersymmetric models in which the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a light gravitino(kev ) . ] and @xmath71 is the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) which decays to a gravitino and a photon ( @xmath72 ) . for supersymmetric models with a light gravitino , the photonic branching ratio of the @xmath71 is naturally large . such a signature has been discussed in  @xcite and more recently in  @xcite in the context of both no - scale supergravity models and gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking models .",
    "other types of new physics to which these search topologies are sensitive include the production of an invisible particle in association with a photon and the production of invisible particles tagged by initial - state radiation .",
    "an example of this is @xmath73@xcite .",
    "the acoplanar - photons search topology also has sensitivity to the production of two particles , one invisible , or with an invisible decay mode , and the other decaying into two photons .",
    "such events might arise from the production of a higgs - like scalar particle , @xmath74 : @xmath75 , followed by s@xmath76@xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "opal results from a search for this process at @xmath79 gev , including the hadronic and leptonic @xmath80 decays , are reported in a separate paper@xcite .",
    "the results from our previous searches  @xcite for @xmath63 and @xmath64 with @xmath66 have been used to set model - dependent limits on excited neutrinos and neutralinos @xcite .",
    "the new results reported here can be used in the same manner .",
    "this paper will first briefly describe the detector and the monte carlo samples used .",
    "the event selection for each search topology will then be described , followed by cross - section measurements for @xmath61 and @xmath62 and comparisons with standard model expectations .",
    "implications of these results on the possibility of new physics processes will be discussed .",
    "the opal detector , which is described in detail in  @xcite , contains a pressurized central tracking system operating inside a solenoid with a magnetic field of 0.435 t. the region outside the solenoid ( barrel ) and the pressure bell ( endcap ) is instrumented with scintillation counters , presamplers and the lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) .",
    "the magnet return yoke is instrumented for hadron calorimetry and is surrounded by external muon chambers .",
    "electromagnetic calorimeters close to the beam axis measure luminosity and complete the acceptance .    the measurements presented here are mainly based on the observation of clusters of energy deposited in the lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this consists of an array of 9,440 lead - glass blocks in the barrel ( @xmath81 ) with a quasi - pointing geometry and two dome - shaped endcap arrays , each of 1,132 lead - glass blocks , covering the polar angle is the polar angle defined with respect to the electron beam direction and @xmath82 is the azimuthal angle . ]",
    "range ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "energies measured in the ecal will normally refer to those obtained after corrections to account for losses in upstream material .",
    "energies without these corrections are called deposited energies . in the regions ( @xmath84 ) and ( @xmath85 ) , the energy resolution of the ecal is degraded relative to the nominal resolution .",
    "this degradation is largely due to increased amounts of material in front of the ecal . in some cases ( where stated ) these regions",
    "have been excluded from the analysis .",
    "fully hermetic electromagnetic calorimeter coverage is achieved beyond the end of the ecal down to small polar angles with the use of the the gamma - catcher calorimeter , the forward calorimeter ( fd ) and the silicon - tungsten calorimeter ( sw ) .",
    "these detectors cover the angular regions with respect to the beam of 140 - 205 mrad , 40 - 145 mrad and 24 - 59 mrad , respectively .",
    "however , a small region centred on a polar angle of 30 mrad lacks useful calorimetric coverage due to the installation , in 1996 , of a thick tungsten shield designed to protect the tracking chambers from synchrotron radiation background .",
    "the effective limit of electromagnetic hermeticity is therefore around 33 mrad .",
    "scintillators in the barrel and endcap regions are used to reject backgrounds from cosmic ray interactions and to provide time measurements for the large fraction ( @xmath86 80% ) of photons which convert in the material in front of the ecal .",
    "the barrel time - of - flight ( tof ) scintillator bars are located outside the solenoid in front of the barrel ecal and match its geometrical acceptance ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "arrays of thin scintillating tiles with embedded wavelength - shifting - fibre readout @xcite were installed prior to the 1997 run .",
    "the new tile endcap ( te ) scintillator arrays are located at @xmath87 behind the pressure bell and in front of the endcap ecal .",
    "additional scintillating tile arrays , referred to as the mip - plug , were installed at polar angles between 40 and 200 mrad and consist of two pairs of scintillating tile layers designed for detection of muons .",
    "the outer pair , covering the angular range of 125 to 200 mrad is used in this paper to provide redundancy in the rejection of events with energetic electromagnetic showers in the gamma - catcher region .",
    "the tracking system , consisting of a silicon microvertex detector ( si ) , a vertex drift chamber ( cv ) and a large volume jet drift chamber ( cj ) , is used to reject events with prompt charged particles .",
    "the silicon microvertex detector consists of two concentric cylindrical layers of silicon microstrip arrays , each layer providing both an azimuthal and longitudinal ( along the beam direction ) coordinate measurement .",
    "the two - layer acceptance covers @xmath88 .",
    "beam related backgrounds and backgrounds arising from cosmic ray interactions are rejected using the scintillator timing measurements and information from the electromagnetic calorimeter shower shape , the hadron calorimeter and the muon detectors .",
    "the integrated luminosities of the data samples are determined to better than 1% from small - angle bhabha scattering events in the sw calorimeter .",
    "triggers@xcite based on electromagnetic energy deposits in either the barrel or endcap electromagnetic calorimeters , and also on a coincidence of energy in the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and a hit in the tof system , lead to full trigger efficiency for photonic events passing the event selection criteria described in the following section .    for the expected standard model signal process ,",
    "@xmath1 + photon(s ) , the monte carlo generator koralz  @xcite was used .",
    "for other expected standard model processes , a number of different generators were used : radcor  @xcite for @xmath89 ; bhwide  @xcite and teegg  @xcite for @xmath90 ; grc4f  @xcite for @xmath91 ; and koralz for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the expected contributions from each of these standard model processes were evaluated using a total equivalent integrated luminosity at least ten times larger than the integrated luminosity of the data sample .    to simulate possible new physics processes of the type @xmath63 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 decays to @xmath94 and @xmath5 escapes detection , a modified version of the susygen  @xcite monte carlo generator was used to produce neutralino pair events of the type @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath97 , with isotropic angular distributions for the production and decay of @xmath68 and including initial - state radiation .",
    "monte carlo events were generated at 40 ( for @xmath98 production ) and 42 ( for @xmath99 production ) points in the kinematically accessible region of the ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) plane .",
    "all the monte carlo samples described above were processed through the opal detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "this section describes the criteria for selecting single - photon and acoplanar - photons events .",
    "the kinematic acceptance of each selection is defined in terms of the photon energy , @xmath102 , and the photon polar angle , @xmath103 .",
    "in addition , the scaled energy , @xmath104 , is defined as @xmath105 , and the scaled transverse energy , @xmath106 , as @xmath107 .    single - photon - : :    one or two photons accompanied by invisible particle(s ) :    +    * at least one photon with @xmath108 and with    @xmath109    ( @xmath110 .",
    "acoplanar - photons - : :    two or more photons accompanied by invisible particle(s ) :    +    * at least two photons , each with @xmath111 and    @xmath109 , or one photon with    @xmath112 gev and    @xmath113 and a second photon with    @xmath112 gev and    @xmath109 .",
    "* the scaled transverse momentum of the two - photon system consisting    of the two highest energy photons , @xmath114 ,    must satisfy @xmath115 .    in each of the two cases , it is desirable to retain acceptance for events with additional photons , if the resulting photonic system is still consistent with the presence of significant missing energy .",
    "this reduces the sensitivity of each measurement to the modelling of higher - order contributions .",
    "consequently , a large fraction of the kinematic acceptance of the acoplanar - photons selection is also contained in the kinematic acceptance of the single - photon selection .",
    "the single - photon selection criteria are similar to the previous opal analysis of photonic events with missing energy@xcite but have increased acceptance for lower energy photons due to improved rejection and control of cosmic ray and beam related backgrounds .",
    "the modifications also improve the efficiency for events with two detected photons .",
    "*   * kinematic acceptance .",
    "* events must contain a primary electromagnetic cluster ( that with the highest deposited energy in the barrel or endcap calorimeters ) in the region @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) with @xmath108 .",

    "*   * cluster quality .",
    "* the primary electromagnetic cluster , combined with any clusters contiguous with it , must be consistent with the cluster size and energy sharing of blocks for a photon coming from near the interaction point .",
    "the cluster size varies in both azimuthal and polar angle extent as a function of @xmath119 .",
    "the cluster extent cuts are parametrized in @xmath119 accordingly .",
    "events are rejected if the cluster energy exceeds the beam energy by more than three standard deviations .",
    "*   * forward energy vetoes .",
    "* events are rejected if the energy sum of gamma - catcher clusters in either end is greater than 5  gev .",
    "events are also rejected if either layer of the outer mip - plug shows evidence of an energetic shower ( pulse - height exceeding about ten minimum ionizing particle equivalents ) .",
    "an event can also be vetoed based on the transverse momentum sum of clusters measured in the forward calorimeters fd and sw . events are rejected that have a transverse momentum sum exceeding 1 gev and where the azimuthal angle of the transverse momentum sum is within @xmath120 in azimuth of the direction opposite the measured momentum of the photonic system .",
    "a final complementary veto rejects events that have an energy sum exceeding 5 gev where the sum is over all clusters in the fd , sw and forward part of the endcap ecal ( @xmath121 ) which are within @xmath120 in azimuth of the direction opposite the measured momentum of the photonic system .",
    "the directional nature of these last two vetoes removes events with forward going high - energy particles that can account for some or all of the missing transverse momentum .",
    "however , it minimizes losses from random noise or accidental energy deposits in the forward detectors .",
    "it also allows for the presence of initial - state radiated photons in the forward region which are not back - to - back with the photon(s ) .",
    "*   * muon veto .",

    "events are required to either contain no reconstructed charged tracks or contain a photon candidate consistent with a photon conversion observed within the central tracking volume .",
    "these events are referred to as non - conversion and conversion candidates , respectively .",

    "the third looks for a series of hits in the outer layers of the hadron calorimeter .",
    "this veto rejects both cosmic rays and beam related backgrounds .",
    "the fourth veto is based on the shape of the cluster in the barrel ecal . the observed energy deposition in each lead - glass block of the cluster",
    "is fitted to the expected shower profile for a photon coming from the interaction point .",
    "one then calculates the variable s ( in radiation lengths ) , defined as the difference between the measured and expected values of the energy - weighted lateral distance from the fitted shower centroid .",
    "events with s exceeding 0.2 are rejected .",
    "this veto rejects cosmic rays and beam related backgrounds , both of which tend to have shower shapes wider than those of photons originating from the interaction point .",

    "* there must be at least one reconstructed charged track in the central tracking chambers .",
    "the charged track with the most hits must be associated in space to at least one of the two most energetic photon candidates .",
    "in particular , the measured polar angle of the track should be consistent with the polar angle of the ecal cluster to within 100 mrad , and the azimuth at the point of closest approach of the track to the interaction point should differ by less than 100 mrad from the measured azimuthal angle of the ecal cluster .",
    "the azimuthal matching criterion is relaxed to 500 mrad for clusters with @xmath134 since conversions at forward angles often lead to large showers and difficulties in resolving the jet chamber left - right ambiguity .",
    "in addition , for such forward photon conversion candidates , which mostly convert in the cv endplate , it was further required that there be at least 12 out of the first 16 wires hit in cj .",
    "*   * prompt charged track veto .",
