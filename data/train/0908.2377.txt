    "in a @xmath0 collision the location of a hard parton - parton scattering in which a parton with transverse momentum @xmath2{gev}/c$ ] is produced is well defined ( @xmath3{fm}$ ] in the plane transverse to the beam axis ) and much smaller than the radius of proton ( @xmath4{fm}$ ] ) .",
    "thus , it is expected that multiple hard parton scatterings can contribute incoherently to the total hard scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "when going from p+p to nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions and neglecting nuclear effects the increase in the number of hard scatterings is given by the nuclear geometry expressed via the nuclear overlap function @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "for a given range of the impact parameter @xmath6 of the a+a collisions the yield of produced partons with a transverse momentum @xmath1 can thus be calculated from the corresponding cross section in p+p collisions according to @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the total number of inelastic a+a collisions and @xmath9 the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "this corresponds to a scaling of the yield of produced high-@xmath1 partons ( and hence also of the yield of hadrons at high @xmath1 ) with the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions ( @xmath10 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the yield of particles at low @xmath11{gev}/c$ ] is expected to scale with the number @xmath12 of nucleons that suffered at least one inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "based on this separation of soft and hard processes the centrality dependence of the charged particle multiplicity in nucleus - nucleus collisions can be predicted .",
    "in this article the focus is on the study of hard scattering in p+p and a+a collisions at rhic by measuring particle yields at high transverse momentum .",

    "thus , one can conclude that the hadron suppression is caused by the presence of the created hot and dense medium and is not related to properties of cold nuclear matter .    in order to search for the onset of the high-@xmath1 hadron suppression cu+cu collisions at three different energies ( @xmath33{gev}$ ] ) were studied by the phenix experiment @xcite . in central cu+cu collisions at @xmath26{gev}$ ]",

    "direct photons are not expected to be suppressed in a+a collisions since they interact only electro - magnetically with the medium and thus have a much longer mean free path length .",

    "can partly be explained by the different quark content of the proton and the neutron ( isospin effect ) which is not taken into account in the definition of @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "roughly speaking , features of nuclear pdf s as compared to proton pdf s are a reduced parton density for @xmath52 ( shadowing ) , an enhancement for @xmath53 ( anti - shadowing ) followed again by a suppression for @xmath54 ( emc - effect ) @xcite . for @xmath55",

    "it is obvious from this comparison that the gluon distribution in the lead nucleus is not well constrained by lepton - nucleus deep inelastic scattering data at low @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",

    "[ fig : npdfs ] ) there is no indication that the suppression of direct photons at high @xmath1 in central au+au collisions is related to the gluon distribution in heavy nuclei .",
    "this is in line with the calculation presented in @xcite .",
    "multiple hard partonic interaction in @xmath68 collisions explain many observed features of these collisions including the rise of the total inelastic @xmath0 cross section with @xmath69 , the increase of @xmath70 with the charged particle multiplicity @xmath71 , the increase of @xmath72 with @xmath69 , the increase of @xmath73 with @xmath69 , and the violation of kno scaling at large @xmath69 . in such mini - jet models a @xmath0 collision is classified either as a purely soft collision or a collision with one or more hard parton interactions depending on a cut - off transverse momentum @xmath74 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "the energy dependence of the charged particle multiplicity in @xmath0 collisions can then be described by @xmath76 this can be extrapolated to nucleus - nucleus collisions by assuming that the soft component scales with the number of participating nucleons @xmath12 whereas the mini - jet component scales with the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath10 : @xmath77 here @xmath78 and @xmath79 are fixed parameters determined from @xmath0 collisions .",

    "[ fig : npdfs ] the data can not be reproduced .",
    "thus , the question whether the two - component mini - jet picture is a useful concept in nucleus - nucleus collisions hinges on the knowledge about the gluon pdf and can only be answered if the uncertainties of the gluon distribution in nuclei can be significantly reduced .",
    "the interest in hard scattering of partons in nucleus - nucleus collisions is twofold : first , qcd predictions for the energy loss of highly - energetic partons in a medium of high color - charge density can be tested experimentally .",
    "second , the observed hadron suppression in conjunction with parton energy loss models renders the possibility to characterize the medium created in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the assumption that indeed the created medium causes the suppression was confirmed by the observation that direct photons at high @xmath1 which result from hard parton - parton scatterings are not suppressed ( at least for @xmath32{gev}/c$ ] in au+au collisions at @xmath48{gev}$ ] ) .",
    "it remains to be understood how the apparent suppression of direct photons with @xmath83{gev}/c$ ] fits into this picture .",
    "it was argued that it is unlikely that this direct - photon suppression is related to the gluon distribution function in the gold nucleus .",
    "a natural extension of the successful concept of multiple partonic interactions in @xmath0 collisions to nucleus - nucleus collisions is the two - component mini - jet model for the centrality ( @xmath12 ) dependence of the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "as shown in @xcite such a model can indeed describe the experimental data , but only if a relatively strong suppression of the gluon distribution in a gold nucleus is assumed .",
    "the gluon distribution in this model appears to be only barely consistent with recent parameterizations such as eps09lo @xcite so that it remains to be seen whether the two - component mini - jet model is a useful concept in nucleus - nucleus collisions ."
