    "<S> , and have been studied extensively through experiments , theories and simulations @xcite . a collection of head - tail symmetric ` apolar ' active particles with an average mutual parallel alignment is said to be in a ` nematic ' state , whereas in an ` isotropic ' state particles remain randomly oriented . </S>",
    "<S> an active system where fluid media do not play important role in emergence of ordered state , and thus the hydrodynamic interactions can be ignored , is called a ` dry active system ' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> active nature of particles introduces a nonequilibrium coupling between density and orientation field , as represented in terms of curvature coupling current in literature @xcite . such coupling in active nematic induces unusual properties like large density fluctuation @xcite and growth kinetics </S>",
    "<S> faster than @xmath0 as in usual conserved model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies of the active nematic found a defect - ordered nematic state @xcite as opposed to the equilibrium nematic for high particle densities . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiment on amolyiod flibrils @xcite also found a phase with coexisting aligned and disordered fibril domains , similar to the defect - ordered state obtained in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> but few investigations have been done on the behaviours of the active nematic in various density limits , especially at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> here we introduce a minimal model for two - dimensional active nematic and compare various ordering phases of active and equilibrium nematic in different density limits . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering in the system is characterised in terms of a scalar order parameter @xmath1 which is the positive eigen value of nematic order parameter @xmath2 @xcite in two - dimensions . in the low density limit </S>",
    "<S> both active and equilibrium systems are in the isotropic ( i ) state with particles randomly oriented throughout the whole system ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> each particle interacts with its nearest neighbours through modified lebwohl - lasher hamiltonian @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the interaction strength between two neighbouring particles . </S>",

    "<S> details of the model and particle movement are shown in supplemental material @xcite section i. the asymmetric move of the active particles does not staisfy the detailed balance condition and arises in general because of the self - propelled nature of the particles in many biological @xcite and granular systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these moves produce an active curvature coupling current in coarse - grained hydrodynamic equations of motion @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> numerical details _ :  we consider a collection of @xmath14 particles with random orientation @xmath15 $ ] , homogeneously distributed on a @xmath16 square lattice ( @xmath17 ) with periodic boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the packing density of the system is @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a particle randomly and move it to an unoccupied neighbouring site , followed by an orientation updation through mc . </S>",
    "<S> we use @xmath19 mc steps to evolve the system to its steady state and all the results have been obtained by averaging over next @xmath20 mc steps . </S>",

    "<S> critical temperature @xmath25 decreases with the lowering of the packing density @xmath3 , similar trend is found in the study of diluted xy - model @xcite for varying nonmagnetic site density . in rest of our calculations temperature is kept fixed at @xmath26 and packing density @xmath3 is varied from small values to complete filling @xmath27 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ phase diagram _ :  at low densities , @xmath28 , the active system is in the isotropic state where the particles with random orientation remain homogeneously distributed throughout the system , and therefore @xmath1 holds vanishingly small values . </S>",
    "<S> the jump occurs in @xmath1 at @xmath4 . for @xmath29 particles cluster in , and both ordered state with high local density and disordered state with low local density coexist ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_snap](b ) - bs-1 ) . mean alignment inside the band is perpendicular to the long axis of the band . in the moderate density limits , band formation in more favourable than lane formation ( mean alignment parallel to the long axis of the structure ) because the number of particles that can have translational motion is much larger in the banded state , and therefore entropy favours band formation . </S>",
    "<S> similar mechanism create the bending instability close to order - disorder transition in the active polar systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the above transition from i state to bs occurs at density lower than the corresponding equilibrium i - n transition density @xmath30 ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> as we further increase @xmath3 , unlike the equilibrium system where @xmath1 increases monotonically with @xmath3 , the active system shows very small change in @xmath1 for a range of density . </S>",
    "<S> this plateau like appearance of @xmath1 with variation in @xmath3 is very similar to plateau phase in magnetization versus field curve of magnetic systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if an energy gap exists between two consecutive magnetic states , a finite field is required for the magnetic system to go from the lower to the higher state . </S>",
    "<S> so until that finite field is applied , the increasing field keeps the system magnetization to be unchanged , and the system is called to be in the plateau phase . with increasing packing density in the plateau regime of the active nematic more particles participate in band formation ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_snap](b ) - bs-1 and bs-2 ) . on further increment of density , close to equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> i - n transition @xmath30 , transverse fluctuations lead the system to a mixed state @xcite .    in the large @xmath3 limit active system shows a bistable behaviour with two distinct steady states ; first , a state where @xmath1 is large and real space configuration is ` homogeneous ordered ' ( ho ) , and the second , an ` inhomogeneous mixed ' ( i m ) state where @xmath1 realizes some moderate values . in the ho state </S>",
    "<S> though the particle orientation is homogeneous , large density inhomogeneity exists in the system ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phase_snap](b ) - ho ) . </S>",
    "<S> i m state is a local ordered state with many aligned clusters of high particle density . </S>",
    "<S> the system consists of many such aligned clusters of high density separated from low density disordered regions and mean alignment in each cluster is in different directions ( see fig . </S>",
