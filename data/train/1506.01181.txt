    "the non - thermal x - ray emission from large scale jets in nearby radio galaxies of the fanaroff - riley class i is expected to be common feature of such type of objects starting from its discovery in two close galaxies cen a or m 87 ( feigelson et al .  1981 , biretta et al .",
    "this x - ray emission smoothly extends up to the radio energy range supporting the idea on its common origin in the synchrotron process of tev electrons ( hardcastle et al .",
    "tev electrons are expected to meet strong soft radiation field , produced either in the synchrotron process or by the stars in the galactic bulge and also the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) , fro its comptonization to tev energies ( e.g. stawarz et al .",
    "2003 , hardcastle & croston  2011 ) .",
    "observations of persistent tev @xmath0-ray emission from such sources should provide important constraints on the high energy particles in the kpc scale jets .",
    "however , since such electrons has to lose energy on a short time scale , they require an _ in situ _ acceleration process .",
    "therefore , efficient acceleration of electrons should occur not only within the inner jet but also in the kpc scale jets .",
    "in fact , the observed x - ray knots in the intermediate scale jets seems to provide conditions for electron acceleration to tev energies .",
    "these might correspond to shocks formed in collisions of winds from compact objects with the jet plasma ( e.g. hardcastle et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "a jet , launched from the vicinity of the central super - massive black hole ( smbh ) , has to pass through the stellar bulge and globular cluster ( gc ) halo around central engine . since the number of stars in the central stellar cluster is expected to be huge , many of them have to be immersed in the jet plasma .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that as a result of the star - jet collisions , stellar winds can provide large amount of barion matter into the jet ( e.g. komissarov  1994 , bowman et al .",
    "1996 , laing & bridle  2002 , hubbard & blackman  2006 ) .",
    "shocks formed in collisions of stellar winds with the plasma in the inner jet can be also responsible for the acceleration of electrons which , comptonizing stellar radiation , might be responsible for the production of @xmath0-ray flares ( e.g. bednarek & protheroe 1997 , barkov et al .",
    "2010 , bosch - ramon et al .",
    "2012 , araudo et al .",
    "2013 , wykes et al .",
    "also collisions of relativistic jet plasma with dense clouds can turn to the @xmath0-ray production ( e.g. blandford & knigl  1979 , dar & laor 1997 , beall & bednarek  1999 , purmohammad & samimi  2001 , araudo et al .",
    "2010 , barkov et al .",
    "these clouds might be fragments of the close to the jet supernova explosion blandford & knigl  ( 1979 ) .",
    "large number of objects , moving in the galactic bulge , are expected to be immersed within the kpc scale jets .",
    "galaxies of different types are surrounded by spherical halos of gcs with the radii of several kpcs .",
    "gcs are expected to produce winds which are the products of the mixture of the relativistic winds from a large population of millisecond pulsars ( msps ) within the gc and slow barionic winds from the red giant stellar population within gcs ( bednarek & sobczak  2014 ) . the mixed millisecond pulsar and stellar winds , expelled from the gc , interact with a relatively rare relativistic intermediate scale jet . as a result , a double shock structure forms around gc .",
    "we argue that particles can be accelerated on such shocks to multi - tev energies .",
    "they produce non - thermal radiation by interacting with the magnetic field in the jet ( the synchrotron radiation ) and with the soft radiation from the galactic bulge at the sub - kpc distance scale and also with the mbr at the a kpc distance scale via inverse compton process .    in this paper",
    "we explore the hypothesis that relativistic electrons appear in the intermediate scale jet as a result of their acceleration on the shocks formed in collisions of many compact objects ( red giants , massive stars or gcs ) with the jet .",
    "it is assumed that at the kpc scale distances jets are already non - relativistic and the doppler boosting effects are small . under this assumption",
    ", we calculate the synchrotron and inverse compton @xmath0-ray emission produced in the intermediate jet for different parameters of such scenario . as an example , we show that the high energy tev @xmath0-ray component in the cen a spectrum , observed by the hess collaboration ( aharonian et al .  2009 ,",
    "sahakyan et al .",
    "2013 ) , might originate within the intermediate scale jet as a result of acceleration of electrons in collisions of many compact objects with the jet plasma .",
    "active galaxies are complicated systems surrounded at larger scale by a few important elements . the central smbh , with the mass in the range @xmath1 m@xmath2 , is surrounded by the bulge , which has quasi - spherical shape , containing late type stars within the radius of the order of @xmath3kpc .",
    "the mass of the bulge is related to the mass of the smbh and its luminosity is of the order of a few tens percent of the whole galaxy .",
    "many smbhs are surrounded by central clusters of luminous and massive stars .",
    "such clusters have usually extended shape with the main axis in the galactic plane .",
    "its mass and dimension is supposed to be determined by the destruction process of another galaxy by the massive galaxy harboring smbh . finally , active galaxy is surrounded by a halo of gcs within the distance scale of several kpc .",
    "the number of gcs is related to the mass of the parent galaxy and the mass of the smbh .",
    "the parameters of these stellar clusters around nucleus of active galaxy are discussed below .",
    "nuclear clusters of massive stars are observed not only around smbhs in massive active galaxies but also in the center of our galaxy . in the case of our galaxy",
    "such cluster is relatively small .",
    "it has a half mass radius of @xmath3 pc and the mass of @xmath4 m@xmath2 ( e.g. schdel et al .",
    "2014 ) in the case of the nearby active radio galaxy cen a , the massive stellar cluster has been formed around 50 - 100 myrs ago as a result of a merger process with a gas reach galaxy .",
    "the observed star formation region is centered on the cen a nucleus .",
    "it has the visual dimensions of @xmath53 kpc@xmath6 ( neff et al .",
    "the current star formation rate has been estimated on 2 m@xmath2yr@xmath7 which will result in production of @xmath8 m@xmath2 of young stars ( wykes et al .",
    "2014 ) . assuming the standard initial mass function of stars",
    ", we estimate the total number of stars with masses above 20 m@xmath2 in the nuclear cluster in cen a on @xmath9 .",
    "a small part of these stars can pass through the jet expelled from the super - massive black hole .",
    "the rough estimate of the number of massive o and wr type stars , contained within the 1.5 kpc from the base of the jet with the opening angle of the order of 0.1 rad for the cluster with dimension mentioned above , is of the order of a hundred .",
    "this simple estimate shows that many massive stars can interact with the jet plasma .",
    "central regions of galaxies are also surrounded by the quasi - spherical concentrations of late type stars ( galactic bulges ) with typical dimensions of the order of @xmath31 kpc and luminosity of several percent of the total luminosity of the parent galaxy .",
    "interestingly , the masses of bulges are related to masses of the central black holes ( for review on scaling formulas see e.g. czerny & nikoajuk  2010 ) . in the case of cen",
    "a , the number of bulge stars within the jet has been estimated on @xmath10 ( wykes et al .",
    "if only a small number of these stars are in the red giant phase , of the order of @xmath310@xmath11 , then the total number of red giants in cen a jet can be as large as @xmath12 .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction also gcs are expected to enter the jet from time to time at the kpc distances from the base of the jet .",
    "in fact the number of observed ( or estimated ) gcs around galaxies seems large enough to guarantee encounters with the jet .",
    "for example , in the case of our galaxy more than 150 has been discovered ( harris  2003 ) .",
    "larger galaxies are expected to have more gcs .",
    "the andromeda galaxy is expected to be surrounded by a halo of @xmath3500 gcs ( barmby & huchra  2001 ) but the giant radio galaxy , m87 , contains already @xmath313000 gcs ( mclaughlin et al .",
    "it is shown that in active galaxies , containing super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , the number of gcs in the galactic halo is correlated with the mass of the central black hole ( e.g. spitler & forbes  2009 , burkert & tremaine  2010 , harris et al .",
    "for example , in the radio galaxy cen a the number of gcs is estimated on @xmath13 ( gltekin et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "we consider active galaxy which has a jet propagating from the smbh .",
    "the jet has a conical structure on the intermediate scale .",
    "the jet opening angle at a kpc distance scale is expected to be of the order of @xmath14 rad , see e.g. observations of the nearby active galaxy cen a ( e.g. clarke et al .",
    "1992 , hardcastle & croston  2011 ) .",
    "then , the solid angle subtended by the jet is , @xmath15 . since the number of compact objects surrounding central engine can be very large ( see above ) , many of the late type stars , massive stars , and gcs can pass through the jet ( see fig.1 on the left ) . as we mentioned above the number of these compact objects",
    "is shown to be related to the mass of the central black hole .",
    "therefore , it is expected that very massive black holes , which are on average more luminous , are also surrounded by a larger number of stars and stellar clusters .",
    "for example , we estimate the number of gcs within the jets of two well known nearby active galaxies , cen a and m87 , on @xmath16 and @xmath370 gcs for the jet opening angle equal to 0.15 rad .",
    "the power of jets in the nearby radio galaxies are typically of the order of @xmath310@xmath17 erg s@xmath7 ( e.g. in cen a , wykes et al .",
    "2013 ) . the ram pressure of the jet plasma can be estimated from ( e.g. bednarek & protheroe  1997 ) , @xmath18 where the power of the jet is @xmath19 erg s@xmath7 , the distance from the base of the jet is @xmath20 kpc and @xmath21 is the velocity of light .",
    "compact objects , mentioned above , are also surrounded by winds which pressure can be balanced by the pressure of the jet plasma . as a result , a double shock structure is expected to appear around the compact objects within the jet as already discussed in the case of different types of stars . in the case of gcs ,",
    "hadronic winds from significant population of red giant stars mix efficiently with the winds from many millisecond pulsars ( msps ) within the gc . as a result , the wind emanates from the gc with the power determined by the energy output from the msp population within the gc .",
    "this mixture of red giant / msp winds collide with the jet s plasma as shown schematically in fig . 1 ( on the right ) .",
    "we argue that particles can be accelerated at the shocks from the jet site to multi - tev energies .",
    "they produce non - thermal radiation by interacting with the magnetic field in the jet ( the synchrotron radiation ) and with the soft radiation from the galactic bulge at the kpc distance scale and also with the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) at the distance scale up to a few tens of kpcs ( the inverse compton radiation ) .",
    "below we consider separately the case of collision of a star with the jet and a gc with the jet since these types of objects differ significantly in the parameters describing their winds .",
    "as we argue above two different classes of stars are expected to surround the central engine of active galaxy at distances up to the order of a kpc .",
    "they are massive stars from the nuclear stellar cluster and late type stars ( red giants ) from the galactic bulge .",
    "in fact , collisions of the winds from massive stars with the inner jet plasma in active galaxies , as a possible scenario for acceleration of particles and their radiation , have been already discussed in bednarek & protheroe  ( 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , distraction process of red giant stars as a result of collisions with the inner jets has been also considered as the mechanism for @xmath0-ray flares",
    "( e.g. barkov et al .  2010 and",
    "bosch - ramon et al .  2012 ) .",
    "such destruction process is possible only in the case of very powerful jets and at a few pc scale distances from the base of the jet . at large distances , where the pressure of the jet plasma is weak , the red giant star winds are strong enough to stop the jet plasma above the red giant surface . as a result ,",
    "the scenario for collisions of red giant stars becomes similar to the scenario of collisions of massive stars with jets on the intermediate scale distances from the base of the jet .",
    "recently , collision of different types of stars with the intermediate scale jets , as the mechanism for the non - thermal synchrotron emission from jets , has been discussed by wykes et al .",
    "( 2014 ) with the application to cen a.    first , we consider collisions of stars with parameters of the red giant stars .",
    "the scenario for collisions of massive stars will be in principle the same .",
    "we will comment on possible differences at the end of this section .",
    "we assume that a small part of the bulge stars , of the order of @xmath22 , are in the phase of the red giant . as an example , we consider red giants with following typical parameters , the radius @xmath23 cm , the surface temperature @xmath24 k , the luminosity @xmath25 l@xmath2 , the mass loss rate @xmath26 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , and the wind velocity @xmath27 cm s@xmath7 . as discussed in sect .  2 , a large number of red giant stars , of the order of @xmath28 , is expected to be immersed in the intermediate jet of active galaxy on the distance scale of @xmath29 kpc (",
    "see estimates for the numbers of bulge stars within the jet in wykes et al .",
    "2014 ) .      the maximum power , that can be extracted from the jet by such a shock structure around a single star , is estimated on , @xmath36 note that this power depends only on the parameters of the red giants star . since the total number of red giants in the jet can be quite large",
    ", a significant energy of the jet can be extracted and eventually transferred to relativistic particles in the acceleration mechanism operating at the collision region of the jet and stellar winds .",
    "the parameters of the massive stars , which can also enter the jet , are clearly much more extreme than expected for the red giants .",
    "for example , the terminal velocities of the winds of massive o type stars can be @xmath37 km s@xmath7 and the mass loss rates @xmath38 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 and of the wr type stars @xmath39 km s@xmath7 and the mass loss rates @xmath40 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , respectively ( lang  1992 ) .",
    "stars in different phases of evolution can have very large mass loss rates of the order of @xmath41 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , e.g. asymptotic giant branch stars or luminous blue variable stars ( see table  1 in wykes et al .",
    "these massive stars , although more rare than red giants , will produce shocks in jets which are able to extract @xmath33 - 4 orders of magnitude more energy from the jet plasma than a single red giant .      as described in sect .  2 ,",
    "gcs are expected to create a halo on several kpc distance scale around the central engine of active galaxy .",
    "a substantial number should be submerged in the jet with the opening angle of the order of @xmath30.1 - 0.15 rad .",
    "gcs are composed from old low mass stars which significant number , on average about @xmath3100 , is expected to be in the red giant phase .",
    "these red giants are expected to be the main contributors of the mass into the gc through their stellar winds .",
    "in fact , the mass loss rate of isolated red giant is expected to be in the range between @xmath42 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 to @xmath43 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 ( boyer et al .",
    "2008 , meszaros et al .",
    "the mass loss rate in the range of @xmath44 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 to @xmath45 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 is estimated from 100 red giants in gc .",
    "it is expected that the single solar mass star should lose about @xmath46 m@xmath2 during its evolution path to the white dwarf ( e.g. see discussion in heyl et al .",
    "simple estimates of the mass loss rates in a single gc , with the total number of stars equal to @xmath47 , gives us the average mass loss rate during 10 gyr equal to @xmath48 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 , consistently with the above estimated value . in our example calculations , we use the mass loss rates of stars in gcs close to this value . on the other hand ,",
    "gcs contain many millisecond pulsars which has been accelerated to short periods due to the transfer of momentum from the stellar companions .",
    "these msps have typical surface magnetic fields of the order of @xmath310@xmath49 g and rotational periods of the order of @xmath33 ms .",
    "the number of such pulsars in a single gc can be of the order of @xmath3100 , as estimated from their observed @xmath0-ray luminosity ( abdo et al .",
    "these msps lose rotational energy in the form of the relativistic pulsar winds that should mix efficiently with slowly moving winds from the red giants ( bednarek & sobczak  2014 ) . as a result",
    ", a barion loaded pulsar wind slows down to the sub - relativistic velocities .",
    "the velocity of the mixed pulsar - stellar wind is estimated to be , @xmath50 where the mass loss rate of stars within the gc scales with @xmath51 m@xmath2 yr@xmath7 and @xmath52 erg s@xmath7 is the rotational energy loss rate of all millisecond pulsars within the gc .    the pressure of the gc wind is estimated from ( bednarek & sobczak  2014 ) , @xmath53 the location of this shock in the jet around the gc , @xmath54 , can be estimated by comparing the pressure of the wind from the gc with the ram pressure of the jet plasma , @xmath55 the radius of the shock should be larger than the core radius of the gc .",
    "note that , most of gcs ( @xmath56 ) in our galaxy have the core radius below 1 pc ( harris  1996 ) .",
    "therefore , for the parameters considered in this paper we expect that this condition is usually fulfilled for the gcs at the distance larger than @xmath31 kpc from the central engine .",
    "the shock structure , formed in collision of the jet with gc wind , is expected to have a double structure with different conditions on both sites ( see fig .  1 on the right ) .",
    "the shock from the jet site is semi - relativistic ( the velocity of plasma after the strong shock drops by a factor of three ) and has relatively strong magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the shock in the gc wind is non - relativistic with weak magnetic field .",
    "we expect that only shock in the jet plasma can accelerate efficiently particles to large energies transferring significant part of the jet power to relativistic electrons .",
    "the power which can be extracted by the shock from the jet plasma can be estimated on , @xmath57 note that the power estimated above for the single collision of the gc with the jet is clearly larger than in the case of a single collision of the red giant star with the jet but it becomes of the order of the power expected in the collision of a single massive star with the jet .",
    "therefore , collisions of gcs with jets at the distance scale of a few kpcs from the central engine can be also responsible for the formation of powerful shocks in jets at such large distances . in the next section we discuss possible acceleration of electrons on the shocks formed in collisions of compact objects with jet plasma in a relatively nearby active galaxies .",
    "in order to estimate the parameters of particles which could be eventually accelerated in such scenario , we consider the physical conditions within the jet . the upper limit on the magnetic field at the base of the jet",
    "can be estimated by assuming that the poynting flux ( @xmath58 ) through the jet , is a part ( @xmath59 ) of the total jet power ( @xmath60 ) , i.e. @xmath61 where the inner radius of the jet can be related to the smbh mass @xmath62 cm , the mass of the bh is @xmath63 , the energy density of the magnetic field is @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the lorentz factor of the jet .",
    "the jet can be either poynting flux dominated ( then @xmath66 ) or matter dominated ( then @xmath67 ) . the magnetic field at the base of the jet can be estimated by reversing eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , @xmath68 the perpendicular component of the magnetic field in the jet ( in respect to the jet axis ) at the distance , @xmath69 , from its base can be approximated by , @xmath70 for large distances from the base of the jet . in this case , @xmath71 does not depend on the mass of the black hole .",
    "we assume that electrons are accelerated at the shock from the site of the jet plasma to energies limited by their synchrotron energy losses .",
    "the energy gain rate by electrons is assumed to be determined by the so called acceleration coefficient , @xmath72 , @xmath73 where @xmath74 tev is the energy of electrons and @xmath75 is the larmor radius of electrons .",
    "this acceleration process can be saturated by the energy losses of electrons .",
    "the synchrotron energy loss rate is , @xmath76 where the energy density of magnetic field is , @xmath77 @xmath78 is the thomson cross section and @xmath79 is the electron rest mass .",
    "then , the maximum energy of electrons , limited by the synchrotron energy losses , are @xmath80 electrons with these maximum energies can not have the larmor radii larger than the dimension of the shock around the compact objects .",
    "the conditions , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , introduce another absolute limit on the maximum electron energy , equal to @xmath83 tev and @xmath84 tev .",
    "the limits due to the larmor radius are clearly above the maximum energies of accelerated electrons .",
    "however , another limit on the maximum energies of electrons is introduced by the time scale spend by electrons at the shock region .",
    "this limit differ for stars and gc .",
    "therefore , we consider it separately .      the maximum energies of electrons can be also limited by their advection time scale along the shock with the flowing plasma .",
    "this time scale can be estimated from , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the velocity of the jet plasma in units of the velocity of light .",
    "the comparison of the acceleration time scale ( @xmath87 , see eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] ) with the advection time scale , @xmath88 , gives us the limit on the maximum energies of electrons accelerated in the stellar shock , @xmath89 note that advection limit on the energy of electrons mainly depends on the parameters of the stellar wind . on the other hand ,",
    "the synchrotron limit mainly depends on the parameters of the jet . in general",
    ", the advection limit becomes important in respect to the synchrotron limit for the red giant stars in contrast to the case of the massive stars .",
    "electrons accelerated at the shock around the star can also lose efficiently energy on the interaction with the stellar radiation . in order to evaluate importance of this process",

    "is given by eq .",
    "the relative energy losses of electrons on these two processes ( in the thomson regime , i.e. for @xmath95 gev ) depends only on the ratio of the energy densities of the radiation and the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , electrons with energies clearly below @xmath96 gev will lose energy more efficiently on the ic process than on the synchrotron process .",
    "however , the energy losses of electrons becomes comparable for tev energies to which these particles are expected to be accelerated at the shocks provided that the jet is poynting flux dominated ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "since the winds of massive stars are clearly more extreme than those of red giants , a relatively stronger ic @xmath0-ray emission ( in respect to the synchrotron emission ) is expected in the case of massive stars within the jets .",
    "the power in relativistic electrons extracted from the shock , created in collision of the jet with stellar winds , is estimated on , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the energy conversion efficiency from the shock to relativistic electrons , and @xmath99 is the number of stars within the jet . the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath100 , is usually expected to be in the range @xmath30.1 - 0.2 .",
    "the number of massive stars within the jet is expected to be a few orders of magnitudes lower than the number of red giants ( see sect .  2 ) . however",
    "the product of the mass loss rate and the wind velocity of a massive star is typically 3 - 4 orders of magnitudes larger ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) . as a result",
    ", the power in relativistic electrons accelerated on the shocks formed by the whole population of red giants and massive stars is expected to be on the similar level .",
    "as above , we constrain the maximum energies of electrons due to their advection along the shock around the gc within the jet .",

    "this condition limits energies of electrons to , @xmath103 in general , this limit is less restrictive than the advection limit for stars within the jet , since the shock dimensions around gcs are expected to be clearly larger for typical parameters of the scenario . the synchrotron limit on the acceleration of electrons dominates over the advection limit for the following condition on the least constrained parameter of the model , i.e. the acceleration coefficient should be , @xmath104 .",
    "if the above condition is fulfilled , then we can estimate the characteristic energies of synchrotron photons produced by electrons on @xmath105 kev , where @xmath106 gs is the critical magnetic field strength . in the case of cen",
    "a , the x - ray emission up to @xmath16 kev is observed ( hardcastle et al",
    ".  2006 ) .",
    "therefore , the acceleration coefficient is expected to be at least @xmath107 .",
    "electrons with such energies should produce synchrotron emission extending to x - ray energies but also tev @xmath0-rays by scattering optical radiation produced within the galactic bulge and the mbr .",
    "let us check whether electrons , accelerated at the shock around gc , will manage to cool efficiently on the synchrotron or the inverse compton ( ic ) processes .",

    "the ic energy losses of electrons can in principle be determined by the soft radiation produced by the gc itself , the galactic bulge thermal radiation and the mbr .",
    "the bulge radiation might play an important role in the inner part of the intermediate scale jet ( i.e @xmath3kpc scale ) .",

    "the energy density of radiation from the gc at the location of the shock can be estimated on @xmath111 ev cm@xmath11 , where the optical luminosity of the gc is @xmath112 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath113 is the luminosity of the sun .",

    ", @xmath120 is always clearly lower than @xmath121 , for reasonable parameters of the scenario .",
    "therefore , energy losses of electrons in the gc radiation can be safely neglected . in the case of the bulge radiation ,",
    "the mean free path of the ic energy losses can become comparable to the characteristic size of the bulge ( of the order of kpc ) and also to the mean free path of electrons on the synchrotron process .",
    "therefore , the ic energy losses in the bulge radiation should be taken into account on the kpc distance scale from the base of the jet .",
    "the mean free path for the ic energy losses of electrons in the mbr is of the order of @xmath3kpcs , for electrons with energies of a hundreds tev .",
    "therefore , ic losses of electrons are expected to become important in the outer parts of the jets at the distance scale of several kpc from the base of the jet .",
    "note that the gc halo still extends to such distances .",

    "is not expected to contribute significantly to the high energy spectrum observed from cen a. on the other hand , about a hundred of massive stars in the jet can produce synchrotron emission on the level observed from the jet of cen a. the accompanying @xmath0-ray emission , from the componization of background radiation by these same electrons , is on the level of the tev @xmath0-ray emission reported by hess from cen a. we also show the synchrotron and ic spectra produced in collisions of 20 gcs with the jet at larger distance scale ( dot - dashed curves ) for these same parameters of the jet . the synchrotron emission is not expected to contribute significantly to the observed x - ray spectrum . however , the ic @xmath0-ray emission peaks at the tev energies .",
    "the cumulative @xmath0-ray spectrum from collisions of massive stars and gcs with the jet is clearly consistent with the level of the tev @xmath0-ray emission observed by hess .",
    "therefore , such model might be responsible for the highest energy @xmath0-ray component observed from cen a. if the jet in cen a still moves with the velocity of the order of @xmath182 over kpc distances , then the calculated spectra ( in fig .",

    "since the expected emission is above the level of sensitivity of the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) , the question on the existence of the low level persistent emission from the intermediate scale jet in cen a should be definitively answered in the coming years .",

    "they are transported with the jet plasma to farther distances from the base of the jet losing energy on the mentioned above radiation processes .",
    "therefore , this high energy emission is expected to be steady during the time scales of the jet dimension ( i.e. thousands of years ) , in contrast to the emission expected from collisions of stars with the inner jets ( below @xmath31 pc , e.g. bednarek & protheroe  1997 ) . moreover , due to the saturation of the acceleration process of leptons by the synchrotron or the advection time scales , the larger energy leptons are expected to be accelerated at farther along the jet . therefore , non - thermal emission from jets should show clear dependence on the energy with the lower energy @xmath0-rays produced closer to the base of the jet .",
    "we predict that the multi - tev @xmath0-rays should have tendency to be produced farther from the base of the jet .",
    "in contrast , such feature may not be observed in the case of the synchrotron x - ray emission if the acceleration of leptons is saturated by synchrotron energy losses .",
    "only when the maximum electron energies are constrained by their escape ( advection ) from the acceleration region , the maximum energies of synchrotron radiation should show energy dependence on the distance from the base of the jet .",
    "we compared the example spectra , obtained in terms of such a model , with the observations of the intermediate scale jet in cen a ( fig .",
    "it is found that in general the observed level of the x - ray emission can be explained as a result of the synchrotron radiation produced by electrons accelerated on the shocks around massive stars . on the other hand ,",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray emission is expected to be produced by leptons accelerated on the shocks around massive stars ( below @xmath31 tev ) and by electrons accelerated on the shocks around gcs ( above @xmath31 tev ) .",
    "this hypothesis could be tested in the near future with the operation of the next generation @xmath0-ray telescopes such as cta .",
    "cta is expected to reach @xmath31 arc min resolution at 10 tev and the integral sensitivity of @xmath184 tev @xmath185 s@xmath7 at a few tev ( acharya et al .",
    "2013 ) . with such angular resolution the tev @xmath0-ray emission from the kpc scale jet in cen a could be resolved and the prediction on the energy dependent emission with the distance from the base of the jet could be confirmed or disproved .",
    "we applied the collision model for the radio galaxies whose intermediate jets are expected to be rather slow and observed at a relatively large angle to the line of sight . if the jets still moves relativistically at the kpc distance scale , then the non - thermal radiation can be significantly doppler boosted ( see e.g. recent paper by bosch - ramon  2015 ) .",
    "in such case the collisions of different types of compact objects ( massive stars , red giants , globular clusters ) with the relativistic jets could provide natural explanation for the powerful non - thermal emission from blazars observed at small angle to then line of sight ."
