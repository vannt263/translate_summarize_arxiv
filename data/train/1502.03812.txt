    "the origin and character of the enigmatic pseudogap phase in the underdoped regime of high temperature cuprate superconductors remains an open problem @xcite . while the insulating parent compounds of these systems are well understood as three - dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnetic mott insulators , the normal ( non - superconducting ) phase above superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath3 ) at finite hole doping evinces an anisotropic spectral gap ( pseudogap ) at low energies below a temperature scale @xmath4 and behaves strikingly differently from a fermi liquid .",
    "understanding the pseudogap phase from which superconductivity develops at lower temperatures is generally understood to be the key to understanding the @xmath0-wave superconducting pairing and the anomalously high transition temperature of the superconducting phase of the high @xmath3 cuprates .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental work has proposed the role of various charge , spin , electron nematic , and current ordered states competing with superconductivity , and also the role of superconducting fluctuations themselves , to explain the pseudogap phase above @xmath3  @xcite . in the class of materials yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 ( ybco ) , exquisite quantum oscillations of various electronic properties with the applied magnetic field , strong enough to suppress superconducting fluctuations and reveal the underlying normal state , have revealed small fermi pockets in excitation spectrum reminiscent of a broken symmetry state competing with superconductivity in the under doped regime . @xcite .",
    "the existence of such small fermi pockets in the underdoped regime combined with a large hole like fermi surface in the overdoped regime , indicates that the normal state of the cuprates , in the absence of superconductivity , goes through a fermi surface reconstruction somewhere near optimal doping .",
    "independent evidence of a similar fermi surface reconstruction  from being large and hole - like in the overdoped phase to small and electron - like at underdoping  is also apparent from the measurements of low temperature hall and seebeck coefficients which turn from positive at higher doping to negative in the underdoped regime @xcite . since the signs of the hall and seebeck coefficients",
    "are determined by the sign of the dominant charge carriers , the low temperature negative sign of these coefficients in the underdoped regime ( in the absence of superconductivity ) can be explained by the existence of electron pockets .",
    "interestingly , the low temperature nernst coefficient , which measures the transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , has also been found to be negative in the under doped regime , while being vanishingly small at higher doping . while the sign of the nernst coefficient , unlike that of hall and seebeck coefficients , is not directly related to the sign of the dominant charge carriers , but also depends of the curvature and topology of the fermi surface , the strikingly different behaviors of the low temperature nernst response at low and high hole dopings also point to the existence of a fermi surface reconstruction near optimal doping . although various charge , spin , and current ordered states have been proposed to account for the fermi surface reconstruction in ybco @xcite , none had so far been observed in bulk - sensitive probes until recently .    in recent x - ray diffraction experiments",
    "two groups have independently found strong evidence for a short range charge density wave phase below the pseudogap temperature scale @xmath8 for a range of hole doping in the underdoped regime of ybco @xcite . in these experiments",
    "it is not conclusively known if the x - ray diffraction peaks derive from an equal distribution of domains with uni - directional stripe - like correlations or from correlations with wave vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) co - existing as in a bi - directional cdw state .",
    "however , the lack of anisotropy in the scattering signals such as intensities and widths , and also salient difference from the stripe like states as observed in the lsco family such as absence of a coincident magnetic order and a strikingly different behavior of the modulation wave vector with hole doping @xcite , indicate that the short - ranged cdw correlations observed in the ybco family may be different from stripes and in fact an incipient cdw order which is bi - directional .",
    "although the temperature ( @xmath12 ) dependence of the correlation length above @xmath3 and only short ranged correlations in the cuo@xmath5 planes indicate that the observed charge order is only quasi - static , the near divergence of the correlation length as @xmath13 and that the scattering signals significantly increase on application of magnetic field below @xmath3 indicate that a true thermodynamic cdw transition at some critical temperature ( @xmath14 ) may be preempted by the superconducting transition at @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , recent inelastic x - ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments indicate that the short - range charge order observed below @xmath8 is in fact truly static @xcite , presumably due to pinning by disorder potential .",
    "evidence for a similar charge density wave transition in the underdoped regime has also been found in other recent experiments  @xcite . in at least two recent experiments @xcite",
    "the charge order has been found to be accompanied by a @xmath0-wave intra - unit - cell form factor , indicating modulation of charge density on the oxygen orbitals sandwiched between neighboring cu atoms on the cuo planes ( the so - called bond - density wave ( bdw ) state ) . taken together , though it is unclear at the moment if the bond density wave order observed in the cuprates is static and long - ranged or fluctuating and short - ranged below @xmath8 , it is clear that its role in the fermiology of the cuprates should be significant especially at low temperatures ( @xmath15 ) and in high magnetic fields ( sufficient to suppress superconductivity ) where the bi - directional bond density wave is expected to develop long range order resulting in fermi surface pockets in the single particle spectrum .",
    "an important part of the fermiology of the cuprates is the normal state nernst effect in the pseudogap phase . the nernst response , which measures the transverse voltage induced by a longitudinal thermal gradient in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , is defined to be positive if dominated by vortices in a superconductor . while the quasiparticle nernst signal is typically small for conventional metals due to sondheimer cancellation , the signal carried by vortices can be large and positive in the presence of superconducting fluctuations , as has been found in the cuprates near superconducting @xmath3 and above . suppressing the superconducting fluctuations by a strong magnetic field",
    "reveals the normal state nernst coefficient ( @xmath16 , with @xmath12 the temperature ) and this has been found to drop with decreasing @xmath12 in the pseudogap phase , culminating in a negative @xmath16 as @xmath17 @xcite . the low temperature negative nernst response as @xmath18 is reminiscent of a similar change of sign ( with decreasing @xmath12 ) in other transport signatures of the pseudogap phase such as hall and seebeck coefficients @xcite .",
    "the signs of the hall and seebeck coefficients are determined by the sign of the dominant charge carriers and can be explained by the existence of an electron pocket centered at @xmath19 where the bi - directional bdw state is a superposition of cdws ( with @xmath0-wave form factors ) with ordering wave vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is similar to the recently found result of a change of sign ( with decreasing temperature ) of the hall and seebeck coefficients in the bi - directional cdw state without the @xmath0-wave form factors @xcite .",
    "the sign of the nernst coefficient , on the other hand , is not directly determined by the sign of the dominant charge carriers and thus may or may not be the same as the sign of the hall and seebeck coefficients .    in this paper",
    "we ask if the quasiparticle nernst coefficient in the mean field bdw state does indeed show a drop with decreasing temperature , with @xmath16 eventually becoming negative as @xmath22 as seen in experiments .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional ( 2d ) bi - directional @xmath1 and @xmath2 bdw state in mean field theory ( valid for temperatures @xmath23 and magnetic fields high enough to eliminate the superconductivity ) and investigate the quasiparticle nernst coefficient as functions of temperature and hole doping appropriate for the underdoped regime of the cuprates .",
    "although the experimental evidence is that for a slight incommensuration in the bdw scattering vectors ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) in this paper we work with a commensurate bdw for simplicity ( i.e. we take @xmath24 , corresponding to charge modulations with periodicity of three lattice vectors ) . we find that , below the bdw transition temperature and in the appropriate regime of hole doping , the fermi surface topology changes from a large hole - like fermi surface at higher doping ( where there is no bdw ) to small fermi surface pockets at lower doping .",
    "a similar fermi surface reconstruction in terms of a cdw state was recently assumed to explain the low frequency of quantum oscillations in the pseudogap phase of the cuprates  @xcite .",
    "we find that the quasiparticle nernst coefficient in the mean field bdw state does indeed show a drop with decreasing temperature , with @xmath16 eventually becoming negative as @xmath22 , as seen in experiments .",

    "in this work we studied the normal state of high @xmath3 cuprates i.e in the absence of superconductivity when a large magnetic field is applied . starting with a mean field hamiltonian for bi - directional bdw order with wave - vectors @xmath238 and @xmath239 , we observed reconstruction of the fermi surface from being large hole - like at higher doping ( when there is no bdw order ) to the appearance of small electron - like and hole - like pockets in the doping regime appropriate for the bdw state , which results from breaking of lattice translational symmetry . the normal state nernst effect is important to understand the fermi surface topology of cuprates in the underdoped regime .",
    "the enhancement and the negative sign of the low temperature nernst signal experimentally observed in the pseudogap phase of cuprates is the main focus of this work .",
    "the nernst response typically vanishes for conventional metals due to sondheimer cancellation , but this cancellation breaks down in the presence of magnetic field at low temperatures due to the presence of a bdw order parameter .",
    "in addition to providing analytical understanding for the breakdown of the sondheimer s cancellation in the presence of the bdw order parameter using the hot spot model , we numerically calculated all the three thermoelectric transport coefficients , namely hall , seebeck and nernst coefficients , in the semi - classical boltzmann approximation . at the temperature scale @xmath23 , we observed a negative nernst coefficient in the underdoped regime .",
    "this low temperature negative nernst response is reminiscent of a similar response of other two transport coefficients , namely the hall and seebeck coefficients .",
    "though the negative sign of the hall and seebeck coefficients can be ascribed to the appearance of electron - like pockets which appear on the fermi surface , the sign of the nernst coefficient is not directly determined by the sign of the dominant charge carriers and depends on the detailed fermi surface topology .",
