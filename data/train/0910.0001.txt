    "2008 ) .",
    "what then is the explanation for the very blue @xmath2 s ?",
    "we explore several possibilities :      a first question is whether it is possible to obtain a @xmath2 of @xmath63 using standard stellar population models ( e.g. , leitherer et al .  1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ) .",
    "the answer is that it is possible , but only for very young ( @xmath735 myr ) star - forming systems ( see figure  [ fig : dbeta ] ) .",
    "however , to do so ignores the nebular continuum emission from the ionized gas around the young stars . including this nebular continuum emission can redden the observed @xmath2 by as much as @xmath740.5 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbeta ] also shows the @xmath2 s predicted for several low metallicity ( 0.02 @xmath75 and 0.2 @xmath75 ) starbursts , as a function of age for the schaerer ( 2002 ) stellar population models ( which  like _ starburst99 _ leitherer et al .",
    "1999  include a nebular contribution ) . in the best cases , the models predict @xmath2 s as blue as @xmath76 , which is redder than what we observe in our faint samples .",
    "measured here , we added @xmath770.1 to the @xmath2 s ( 1300 - 1800baseline ) tabulated in the schaerer ( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "] this would suggest that lower metallicities are needed since the standard leitherer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) or bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population models do not produce blue enough colors to match those found in our lower luminosity @xmath0 sample .",
    "of course , the significance of this result is only modest ( @xmath78 ) , but the similarly blue colors observed for z@xmath108 selections ( section 3.6 ) suggest that we may want to take this finding at face value .      in figure  [ fig : dbeta2 ] we present the @xmath2 s predicted by the schaerer ( 2003 ) stellar population models ( which conveniently provide predictions at extremely low metallicities ) as a function of age for instantaneous bursts assuming a metallicity of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and zero ( population iii ) .",
    ", inverse @xmath82 , csf ) produce comparable @xmath2 s . ] from the figure , it is clear that the nebular component contributes significantly to the total light output from @xmath83 @xmath75 stellar populations .    while initially somewhat red due to the nebular contribution , the predicted @xmath2 s for these ultra - low metallicity models become much bluer at ages @xmath84 myr , eventually reaching @xmath2 s of @xmath773 .",
    "such metallicities and ages are not necessarily unreasonable for lower luminosity galaxies at @xmath0 , and therefore at least one possible explanation for the very blue @xmath2 s in our selections is that the metallicities for galaxies in our sample may be @xmath85 .",
    "the above explanation may explain some of the very blue galaxies in our selection , but given that @xmath65 only for a limited period ( 10 - 30 myr after a burst ) , it seems unlikely to be the general explanation ( unless updated models revise the theoretical seds ) .",
    "one seemingly attractive explanation for the very blue @xmath2 s observed is through a top - heavy imf , since galaxy stellar populations would be weighted towards massive , blue stars .",
    "the difficulty with this explanation is that these same massive stars are extraordinarily efficient at ionizing the gas around them  resulting in substantial nebular emission and leaving the galaxy with a net @xmath2 no bluer ( and likely redder ) than the young ( @xmath731 myr ) bursts shown in figures  [ fig : dbeta]-[fig : dbeta2 ] ( see also discussion in leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "a significant obstacle to matching the very blue @xmath2 s observed is the red nebular emission associated with hot , ionizing stars .",
    "the nebular contribution could be reduced in a number of ways , by changes to the ionization parameter , metallicity , geometry , etc .",
    "assessing the impact of such changes would benefit from further detailed modelling .",
    "however , we should emphasize that regardless of changes to the nebular contribution very low metallicity models ( or very young ages ) appear to be needed to match the very blue @xmath2 s observed .",
    "one possibility that we have explored to reduce the nebular emission contribution is if the ionizing radiation leaks directly into the igm ( e.g. , due to the effect of sne on the galaxies ism , possibly from a top - heavy imf : trenti & shull 2009 ) .",
    "we consider such a possibility schematically in figure  [ fig : escapef ] , showing the time - averaged @xmath2 s expected for stellar populations of various metallicities as a function of the escape fraction @xmath86 of ionizing photons into the igm .",
    "for @xmath86 of unity , we simply recover the @xmath2 s from the pure stellar seds and for @xmath86 of zero , we recover the stellar + nebular seds . for fractional @xmath86 ,",
    "we interpolate between the two extremes .",
    "the time - averaged @xmath2 s used for figure  [ fig : escapef ] is based upon those presented in figure  [ fig : dbeta2 ] .    comparing the predicted @xmath2 s with that observed ( grey - shaded region : figure  [ fig : escapef ] ) ,",
    "we see that @xmath870.3 would permit us to easily match the observations .",
    "such an escape fraction is signicantly higher than the @xmath1010% frequently assumed in calculations assessing the sufficiency of galaxies to reionize the universe .",
    "since most of the luminosity density at @xmath88 comes from low luminosity galaxies , the estimated number of ionizing photons in the @xmath88 universe could increase by factors of @xmath153 .",
    "such a large change could provide the needed photons to reionize the universe , providing a resolution to the current debate ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",

    "the strikingly blue uv - continum slopes @xmath2 s seen at lower luminosities in candidate @xmath0 galaxies ( also apparent in the bouwens et al .  2009b @xmath62 sample )",
    "indicate that we are now beginning to explore a regime where the nature of galaxies and their stellar populations are undergoing a dramatic change .",
    "these results raise many as yet unanswered questions , but could be heralding the transition from the first stars and youngest objects within the first 400 myr at @xmath8910 to the galaxies that dominate the universe for the next 2 gyr and provide clues as to the source of photons that reionize the universe .",
