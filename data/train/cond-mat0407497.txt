    "the pseudogap in the cuprates is widely believed to hold an important clue to the fundamental nature of these systems.@xcite through angular resolved photoemission studies@xcite of the variation around the fermi surface of the leading edge of the electron spectral density , it has been established that the pseudogap has d - wave symmetry as does the superconducting gap . a smooth evolution of the superconducting gap into the pseudogap is also observed in tunneling@xcite which shows that , in the underdoped regime , the gap fills in with increasing temperature but does not close as one goes through @xmath0 .",
    "these ideas have led to a school of thought that believes that the pseudogap is a precursor to superconductivity .",
    "one model is the preformed pair@xcite model with phase coherence lost at the superconducting @xmath0 , but the pairs remain till the higher pseudogap temperature @xmath1 .",
    "another model includes finite momentum pairs@xcite , which exist at any finite temperature below @xmath1 but do not contribute to the superfluid stiffness .",
    "no zero momentum cooper pairs remain above @xmath0 where superconductivity is lost .",
    "a second school of thought envisages that the pseudogap has its origin in a competing order parameter.@xcite the ddw theory is found among this group .",
    "it establishes a charge density wave order which has d - wave symmetry and which opens at the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone as the competing order parameter",
    ". the ddw model@xcite breaks time reversal symmetry because it introduces bond currents which also have small orbital magnetic moments .",
    "the two dimensional @xmath2 brillouin zone is halved into a lower and an upper antiferromagnetic brillouin zone .",
    "the ddw model can be included in the group of models associated with unconventional density waves ( udw ) , which have been proposed to explain some phases of correlated electron systems .",
    "for instance , udws have been used to understand quasi - two dimensional organic conductors , such as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5.@xcite unconventional density waves have a gap which averages to zero on the fermi surface ( although in contrast , the ddw gap , not opening at the fermi surface , can only average to zero over the brillouin zone ) . likewise , there is no periodic modulation in the charge or spin density , which makes them difficult to detect experimentally .",
    "for this reason it is very important to have predictions for transport properties in order to look for features that may characterize them .    in this paper , we calculate the optical conductivity and the electronic raman response for the ddw model . for tight - binding bands with first - nearest - neighbours only , the chemical potential acts as the lower cutoff on the interband signal in both optical responses as first discussed by yang and nayak@xcite in the case of optical conductivity . as the second - nearest - neighbour hopping is increased from zero , the cutoff remains , but shifts and is no longer at twice the chemical potential .",
    "the role of the chemical potential in the optical response is intimately related to the fact that the ddw order parameter opens at the antiferromagnetic brillouin zone . as a consequence optical spectral weight",
    "is transferred from intraband to interband transitions in the energy range of the gap with little change in total spectral weight .",
    "we obtain a peak in the real part of the conductivity coming from the interband contribution .",
    "this feature is robust with respect to different dispersion relations with second - nearest - neighbours .",
    "it is modified by impurities and by inelastic scattering , which shift the energy of the structure and obscure the cutoff , making an unambiguous determination of the pseudogap difficult . as the temperature is increased , the interband spectral weight loses intensity .",
    "it is fully depleted at the pseudogap temperature @xmath1 at which point it has all been transferred to the intraband .",
    "a similar peak is found in the optical scattering rate , but it can be shifted in energy .",
    "this feature can be used to test for the ddw state , but so far , it has not been seen in the cuprates .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we present the ddw model , then in section [ sec : one - part ] , we discuss the one - particle properties relevant for our problem . section [ sec : conduc ] treats the problem of the optical conductivity and of the optical spectral weight .",
    "section [ sec : raman ] deals with the electronic raman response . in section",

    "the mfl result ( black curve ) can be understood as a case where impurity scattering effectively increases with increasing frequency .",
    "this has the outcome of spreading the interband spectral weight over a much larger frequency range reducing the prominence of the peak seen in the dashed curve and shifting it to lower energy .",

    "such considerations go beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the effects of energy dependence in the electronic density of states @xmath230 on the self - energy and on the conductivity have recently been studied@xcite for elastic impurity scattering and are well understood .",
    "for example , a depression in @xmath230 below its constant background value around the fermi energy , leads directly to a corresponding reduction in the optical scattering rate in this same frequency region . in a non - self - consistent approach , the constant quasiparticle scattering rate of the flat @xmath230 case ,",
    "is simply multiplied by @xmath230 to lowest order . in our case , this would be the @xmath230 of the ddw as shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , a reduction of @xmath231 below the value seen in fig  [ fig : lorenz ] is expected for frequencies below the gap and would be associated with self - energy corrections .    finally , we discuss the issue of comparison with experiment .",
    "this model predicts the appearance of an interband contribution in the pseudogap phase and an accompanying peak in the optical scattering rate . this interband contribution should have a feature at lower energy corresponding to a lower cutoff set by @xmath50 and a higher cutoff of about @xmath114 .",
    "the lower feature should shift to higher energy with increased doping , however , from experiment the gap decreases with doping and hence the upper edge in the conductivity should decrease with increased doping .",

    "we find that the experimental evidence from optical conductivity , at this time , does not support the ddw model for the cuprates",
    ". however , this model may find application in other systems in the future .",
    "we have calculated the optical conductivity and the raman response for a ddw system .",
    "there is a cutoff at low frequencies in the interband response for both the optical conductivity and the raman response .",
    "this cutoff is at @xmath50 if there is no imperfect nesting term in the dispersion relation .",
    "the imperfect nesting adds directly to the chemical potential and shifts the cutoff to lower frequency but does not eliminate it . including scattering makes the cutoff harder to discern .    as the chemical potential",
    "is changed we find a readjustment of the spectral weight between the inter- and intraband conductivities .",
    "that part of the interband contribution , ranging from frequencies zero to @xmath50 , is transferred at zero temperature to the drude weight as the chemical potential is increased with increasing doping . however",
    ", contrary to a first expectation there is little loss in the total spectral weight with the opening of the pseudogap .",
    "this result agrees with experiments.@xcite    as mentioned above , the @xmath50 cutoff also appears in the electronic raman scattering . the best channels to observe the cutoff at @xmath50 are @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the @xmath146 channel projects out the antinodal region where the gap is biggest , and the low intensity of the raman scattering at small @xmath129 , where it goes like @xmath164 , may make the cutoff difficult to see .    the behaviour with temperature of the optical conductivity has two characteristics : 1 ) the expected shift of the @xmath114 feature to lower frequencies , for a mean field theory with order parameter vanishing at @xmath1 , and 2 ) the transfer of spectral weight from interband to intraband as the interband contribution collapses . there is also a filling of the depression between low frequencies and @xmath50 .",
    "an important result of this paper is that there is a peak in the real part of the optical conductivity in the region @xmath232 that comes from the interband conductivity with @xmath233 for @xmath44 .",

    "<S> we have calculated the optical conductivity and the raman response for the d - density wave model , proposed as a possible explanation for the pseudogap seen in high @xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the total optical spectral weight remains approximately constant on opening of the pseudogap at fixed temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because there is a transfer of weight from the drude peak to interband transitions across the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the interband peak in the optical conductivity is prominent but becomes progressively reduced with increasing temperature , with impurity scattering , which distributes it over a larger energy range , and with inelastic scattering which can also shift its position , making it difficult to have a direct determination of the value of the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> corresponding structure is seen in the optical scattering rate , but not necessarily at the same energies as in the conductivity . </S>"
