    "ever since eugene wigner conjectured that random matrices could be used to approximate the spacing distribution between adjacent energy levels in heavy nuclei ( see @xcite ) , random matrix theory has been a powerful tool in modeling many complex systems , as described in firk and miller @xcite and exemplified in miller , novikoff , and sabelli @xcite , baik , borodin , deift , and suidan @xcite , and krbalek and seba @xcite , to name a few diverse representatives .",
    "for example , while the schrdinger equation can be solved for the simple nuclear structure of hydrogen , there is no known closed - form expression for the nuclear energy levels of uranium , which has over 200 protons and neutrons interacting in its nucleus .",
    "wigner s great insight was to model the infinite dimensional hamiltonian matrix with the limit of @xmath0 real symmetric matrices , in which each entry is chosen randomly from a gaussian density .",
    "n _ , one calculates averages over a weighted set of all possible matrices of size _",
    "n _ , such as the average density of normalized eigenvalues ( analagous to the energy levels ) .",
    "similar to the central limit theorem , as @xmath1 the behavior of the normalized eigenvalues of almost any randomly chosen matrix agrees with the limits of the system averages .",
    "although wigner chose the gaussian density , one could instead choose a generic probability distribution _",
    "p _ with mean 0 , variance 1 , and finite higher moments .",
    "for example , for real symmetric matrices with entries chosen as i.i.d .",
    "random variables from such a probability distribution , it has been proved that the limiting distribution of the density of normalized eigenvalues is the semicircle law ( see @xcite ) independent of _ p_. although there are interesting results that have been proved for the adjacent spacing distribution of normalized eigenvalues that only recently have been proved to hold for all such @xmath2 ( see for example @xcite ) , we will focus only on densities in this paper .",
    "it is interesting to explore how the eigenvalue behavior changes when additional structure is imposed on real symmetric matrices .",
    "real symmetric matrices have @xmath3 independent parameters , from the upper triangle of the matrix . for sub - ensembles that have fewer degrees of freedom",
    ", different limiting distributions can arise .",
    "one example of a thin subset that only has _",
    "n _ degrees of freedom is the @xmath0 real symmetric toeplitz matrices , which are constant along the diagonals : @xmath4 another is the real symmetric hankel matrices , which are constant along the skew diagonals : @xmath5 bai @xcite proposed studying the density of normalized eigenvalues of real symmetric toeplitz matrices .",
    "initially , numerical investigations suggested that the density of normalized eigenvalues might converge to the gaussian ; however , bose , chatterjee , and gangopadhyay @xcite , bryc , dembo , and jiang @xcite , and hammond and miller @xcite showed that this is not the case by calculating the fourth moment to be 2 @xmath6 , close to but not equal to the standard gaussian s fourth moment of 3 .",
    "massey , miller , and sinsheimer @xcite then found that by imposing additional structure on the toeplitz matrices by making the first row a palindrome , the limiting spectral measures converge in probability and almost surely to the standard gaussian .",
    "other generalizations include studying the effect of increasing the palindromicity of palindromic toeplitz matrices ( see @xcite ) and scaling each entry by the square root of the number of times that entry appears in the matrix ( see @xcite ) . in this paper",
