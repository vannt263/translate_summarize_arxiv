    "<S> we study the structure - dependent contributions to the radiative baryonic @xmath0 decays of @xmath1 in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the decay branching ratios of @xmath2 are @xmath3 , which are larger than the estimated values of @xmath4 induced from inner bremsstrahlung effects of the corresponding two - body modes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that @xmath5 is around @xmath6 , which is close to the pole model estimation but smaller than the experimental measurement from belle .    the radiative baryonic @xmath0 decays of @xmath7 are of interest since they are three - body decays with two spin-1/2 baryons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and one spin-1 photon in the final states . </S>",
    "<S> the rich spin structures allow us to explore various interesting observables such as triple momentum correlations to investigate cp or t violation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since these radiative decays could dominantly arise from the short - distance electromagnetic penguin transition of @xmath10 @xcite which has been utilized to place significant constraints on physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , they then appear to be the potentially applicable probes to new physics .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two sources to produce radiative baryonic @xmath0 decays . </S>",
    "<S> one is the inner bremsstrahlung ( ib ) effect , in which the radiative baryonic @xmath0 decays of @xmath11 are from their two - body decay counterparts of @xmath12 via the supplementary emitting photon attaching to one of the final baryonic states . clearly , the radiative decay rates due to the ib contributions are suppressed by @xmath13 comparing with their counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> according to the existing upper bounds of @xmath14 , given by @xcite @xmath15 one finds that @xmath16 unfortunately , the above branching ratios are far from the present accessibility at the b factories of babar and belle . </S>",
    "<S> however , the other source , which is the structure - dependent ( sd ) , is expected to enhance the decays of @xmath17 , such as @xmath18 arising from @xmath19 @xcite . with the large branching ratio of @xmath20 @xcite in the range of @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> we expect that @xmath22 could be as large as @xmath23 . in this report </S>",
    "<S> , we shall concentrate on the sd contributions to @xmath24 .    to start our study </S>",
    "<S> , we must tackle the cumbersome transition matrix elements in @xmath25 . as more and more experimental data on three - body </S>",
    "<S> decays @xcite in recent years , the theoretical progresses are improved to resolve the transition matrix element problems . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting approach is to use the pole model @xcite through the intermediated particles and another one is to rely on the qcd counting rules @xcite by relating the transition matrix elements with three form factors and fitting with experimental data . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , cheng and yang have worked out the radiative baryonic b decays based on the pole model . in this paper , we handle the transition matrix elements according to the qcd counting rules .     </S>",

    "<S> [ penguin ] , in the sm the relevant hamiltonian due to the sd contribution for @xmath28 is @xmath29 with the tensor operator @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the ckm matrix elements and wilson coefficient , respectively , and the decay amplitude is found to be @xmath33 where we have used the condition @xmath34 such that the terms relating to @xmath35 are neglected . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . in their analysis , three form factors @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are used to describe @xmath43 transitions based on the qcd counting rules @xcite , that require the form factors to behave as inverse powers of @xmath44 . </S>",

    "<S> we note that the terms corresponding to @xmath60 disappear due to the fact of @xmath61 . even though @xmath62 can only be determined by experimental data , according to qcd counting rules , @xmath62 needs an additional @xmath63 than @xmath64 to flip the helicity , so that it is guaranteed to give a small contribution and can be neglected .    after summing over the photon polarizations and baryon spins , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ampl ] ) , the decay rate of @xmath65 is given by the integration of @xmath66 dm^2_{\\lambda \\bar p}dm^2_{\\bar p\\gamma } \\label{rate}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 it is important to note that , since the penguin - induced radiative @xmath0 decays are associated with axial - vector currents shown in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ a1 ] ) , we have used @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 , to sum over the photon polarizations instead of the direct replacement of @xmath70 which is valid in the qed - like theory due to the ward identity .    for the numerical analysis of the branching ratios , we take the effective wilson coefficient @xmath71 @xcite , the running quark mass @xmath72 gev and ckm matrix elements @xmath73 . even though there are no theoretical calculations to the unknown @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . by virtue of the approach of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these form factors are related to the present experimental data , such as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 @xcite and @xmath80 @xcite , characterized by an emitted pseudoscalar meson . for a reliable @xmath81 fitting , </S>",
    "<S> we need 2 degrees of freedom ( dof ) by ignoring the @xmath76 term since its contribution is always associated with one more @xmath63 over @xmath74 and @xmath75 ones , as seen in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ para ] ) . we will take a consistent check in the next paragraph to this simplification . to illustrate our results </S>",
    "<S> , we fix the color number @xmath82 and weak phase @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the input experimental data and numerical values are summarized in table [ parameter ] .    </S>",
    "<S> .fits of ( @xmath74,@xmath75 ) in units of @xmath84 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we note that , in table [ brtotal ] , the value in the bracket of the third column for @xmath5 is not a prediction but a consistency comparison with the puting - back form factors , since we have used the observed value of @xmath85 from belle . </S>",
    "<S> we found that , except for @xmath5 , all predicted values are @xmath3 . in terms of inverse sign between @xmath74 and @xmath75 , </S>",
    "<S> there are constructive effects for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which are proportional to ( @xmath88 ) as shown in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ form1 ] ) , whereas destructive effects make other @xmath89 and @xmath90 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ formtotal ] ) small . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , all modes for @xmath91 radiative baryonic decays are suppressed except for @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that such suppressions exist only in the sm - like theories . </S>",
    "<S> thus , these radiative baryonic decays are useful modes for testing the new physics .    </S>",
    "<S> as seen in table [ brtotal ] , both our results and those of the pole model satisfy the relations of @xmath92 and @xmath93 because of the su(3 ) symmetry . in the pole model , the decay branching ratios of @xmath94 and @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> are found to be large , around @xmath96 , since ther are intermediated through @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which correspond to large coupling constants @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our work , the branching ratio of @xmath101 is about three times larger than that of @xmath95 , which is @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of these differences , both two methods are within the experimental data allowed ranges , such as those of @xmath102_{e_{\\gamma}>2.0\\text { gev}}<3.3\\times 10^{-6}\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ & [ br(b^- </S>",

    "<S> finally , we relate the @xmath104 decays with the corresponding @xmath91 modes in terms of qcd counting rules even though there are no experimental data on radiative baryonic @xmath104 decays . </S>",
    "<S> when neglecting the mass and life time differences , we obtain @xmath105 which are also guaranteed by the @xmath106 symmetry . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ relation ] ) , we see that @xmath107 can be as large as @xmath5 .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the sd contributions to the radiative baryonic decays of @xmath1 in the sm are associated with the form factors of @xmath40 , @xmath42 and @xmath41 in the matrix elements of the @xmath108 transition . </S>",
    "<S> most of the predicted values for @xmath109 are spanning in the order of @xmath110 , which are larger than the estimated values of @xmath4 due to the ib effects of their two - body counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we have found that @xmath111 is @xmath112 and @xmath113 with and without @xmath76 , respectively , which are consistent with the pole model prediction @xcite but smaller than the experimental data from belle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more precise measurements are clearly needed . </S>"
