    "sgrbs are not distinguished from lgrbs only by their duration . if we consider the observed prompt emission , negligible spectral lag ( norris , marani & bonnell 2000 ; norris , scargle & bonnell 2001 ) and harder spectra ( kouveliotou et al . 1993 ) are common for sgrbs . on the other hand ,",

    "finally , given that the measured duration of the grb prompt emission can vary for different instrument ( e.g. due to the different energy band used ) , it has been recently proposed that the value of @xmath16 used to divide the long and short grbs should be reduced to about 0.8 s for the _ swift _ bursts ( bromberg et al .",

    "inspired by the criteria we followed to build a complete sample of lgrbs ( the bat6 sample ; salvaterra et al .",

    "( 2012 ) to built the bat6 sample of lgrbs . being free of selection effects ( except for the flux limit ) , this sample ( the _ complete _ sample from now on ) , although relatively small , provides a useful benchmark to compare the rest - frame physical properties of sgrb prompt and afterglow emission .",

    "the scatter increases and these correlations become much less significant . the early time",

    "in particular , the early time @xmath33 correlations for short and long grbs from the two samples have the same slope , with the sgrbs lying on the faint end of the correlation ( in agreement with what found by nysewander et al . 2009 ) . to compare them qualitatively ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] the time resolved prompt - afterglow correlations for the sgrbs of our _ complete _ sample and for the lgrbs of the bat6 sample . concerning the @xmath34 plane we note that at all times , assuming the same @xmath28 , sgrbs have on average lower x - ray luminosity with respect to lgrbs .",
    "however , we note that the systematics in the procedure of @xmath28 estimate for sgrbs discussed in sect .",
    "4.2.1 for the @xmath35 relation might amplify this effect .",
    "similarly , compared to lgrbs , for a given @xmath29 , sgrbs are found at an average lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "considering the correlation found between @xmath36 and @xmath8 , such a result can be considered a natural consequence of the inconsistency of sgrbs with the @xmath37 correlation ( fig .",
    "3 , upper panel ) .",
    "another feature arising from the comparison of the short and long grb samples is that the sgrbs prompt - afterglow correlations show a scatter much larger than what observed for lgrbs , especially at late times ( @xmath38 hr ) .",
    "although this effect can be related to the lower number of data points in the sgrb sample , it may suggest that the sgrbs x - ray luminosity is not a proxy for @xmath8 and @xmath28 as good as it is found to be for the lgrbs ( davanzo et al .",
    "2012 ) . such phenomenon might be indicative of a lower radiative efficiency of the central engine related to the different progenitor or be the consequence of a different circumburst medium .",
    "finally , we note from fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] that the two debated short grb090426 and grb100816a always fall in the lgrbs region of the different correlation planes .",
    "while this can be considered as a further evidence against the classification of grb100816a as a sgrb , we stress that the same reasoning can not be applied safely to grb090426 given the poor constraints on its prompt emission spectrum ( see sect .",
    "4.2.1 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of sgrbs can provide an indirect tool to constrain the nature of their progenitors and discriminate among the evolutionary channels .",
    "the redshift distribution of merger events of dynamically formed double compact object systems is expected to be different from that of primordial binaries . in particular , given the relatively short delay between formation and merging ( @xmath39  gyr ) , sgrbs originated by the `` fast '' primordial channel ( sect .",
    "4.1 ) should have a redshift distribution which broadly follow that of the star formation , especially at low redshift .",
    "the average ( median ) redshift for the sgrbs of our _ complete _ sample is @xmath40 ( 0.72 ) . this value is higher than the one obtained by fong et al .",
    "( 2013 ) by considering the whole _",

    "indeed , the average redshift of our _ complete _ sample is consistent with the expected peak for the redshift distribution of sgrbs originated by the primordial formation channel ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in the primordial binary scenario , the intrinsic formation rate , defined as the number of bursts per unit time and unit comoving volume at redshift @xmath44 ,",
    "@xmath45 is given by the convolution of the massive star binary formation rate and a delay time distribution function @xmath46 .",
    "the delay is the time interval between the formation of the massive star binary and the merging of the compact objects .",
    "the formation rate is assumed to be proportional to the cosmic star formation rate , @xmath47 , parametrized as in hopkins & beacom ( 2006 ) .",

    "for the delay time distribution function @xmath46 , we adopt the simple expression : @xmath51 with @xmath52 , as suggested from an updated analysis of double compact object mergers performed using population synthesis methods ( portegies zwart & yungeson 1998 ; schneider et al . 2001 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2006 ; oshaughnessy et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , some uncertainty remains on the exact value of the @xmath53 exponent ( berger 2014 , and references therein ) . for a comparison with the data , we compute the observed distribution of sgrbs for three different values of @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 , @xmath52 and @xmath55 ( see also behroozi , ramirez - ruiz & fryer 2014 ) , with characteristic delay times varying from @xmath56 myr to @xmath57 gyr .",

    "@xmath48 is the comoving burst formation rate normalized to unity at @xmath79 as computed in eq .  3 and @xmath80 is the sgrb formation rate at @xmath79 .",
    "finally , we assume that the luminosity function of short grbs is well described by a single power - law of power - index @xmath81 for luminosity in the range @xmath82 erg s@xmath24 .",
    "following salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , we obtain the value of @xmath81 by fitting the differential photon flux distribution of sgrbs with @xmath83 s detected by batse in the 50 - 300 kev band ( paciesas et al .",

    "we note that having a flux - limited sample , with a clear photon flux cut , is an asset for the comparison with the model predictions .",
    "model results computed for the primordial formation channel with different time delay distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_distrib ] .",
    "the shaded area accounts for the observed cumulative redshift distribution including the uncertainties due the lack of a secure redshift determination for @xmath90 of the sgrbs of the _ complete _ sample . from the plot",
    "it is clear that the model with @xmath55 can be firmly discarted .",
    "a model with @xmath52 is still acceptable ( although at the lower limit of the observed redshift distribution ) , while the model with a time delay distribution @xmath91 looks to be favoured in accounting for the observed redshift distribution of the sgrbs of our sample , suggesting that they are mainly originated by primordial double compact object systems merging in a relatively short time .",
    "this differs from the results of a similar analysis carried on for the bat6 sample of long grbs : to account for their observed redshift distribution , the rate of long grb formation has to increase with redshift on the top of the known evolution of the sfr density as @xmath92 ( salvaterra et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "finally , we note that a significant contribution of sgrbs with dynamical origin would require a lower mean redshift ( salvaterra et al . 2008 ; guetta et al . 2008 ) , suggesting that the contribution of this formation channel to the sgrbs should be negligible and/or limited to the faintest events ( which are not included in our flux - limited sample ) . on the other hand one can conclude that dynamically formed sgrbs should be intrinsically sub - energetic given that , occurring at an average lower redshift , they should show a relatively high observed flux ( and , in principle , fall in a flux - limited sample like the one presented in this paper ) .",
    "a tentative estimate of the fraction of sgrbs with dynamical origin in our sample is given in the next subsection .",
    "the distribution of the intrinsic x - ray absorbing column densities of the sgrb of our _ complete _ sample has a mean value @xmath93 and a standard deviation @xmath94 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : nh ] ) . when compared in the same redshift bin ,",
    "the distribution of the intrinsic x - ray absorbing column densities of the two sample are fully consistent . a two - sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test gives a probability of 34% , likely indicating that the two distributions are drawn from the same population .",
    "such result is in agreement with the findings ( obtained following a similar procedure ) by kopac et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and margutti et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "although this result can be intepreted as the evidence of a common environment for long and short grbs , we caution that the intrinsc x - ray @xmath98 might be a good proxy of the grb host galaxy global properties but not for the specific properties of the circumburst medium .",
    "furthermore , the possibility that gas along the line of sight in the diffuse intergalactic medium or intervening absorbing systems can contribute to the absorption observed in the x - ray emission of grbs has to be taken into account ( behar et al .",
    "2011 ; campana et al .",
    "2012 ; starling et al .",
    "however , such effect is expected to dominate at @xmath99 , while at lower redshifts , comparable to the values found for our _ complete _ sample , the absorption within the grb host galaxy is expected to dominate ( starling et al .",
    "2013 ) . for lgrbs ,",
    "the massive star progenitor is expected to significantly enrich the surrounding environment with metals ( whose x - ray @xmath98 is a proxy ) before the collapse with its stellar wind .",
    "alternatively , it has been recently proposed that the helium in the h ii regions where the burst may occur is responsible for the observed x - ray absorption in lgrbs ( watson et al .",
    "2013 ) . under these hypothesis , a high intrinsic x - ray @xmath98 , can be interpreted as the evidence of a dense circumburst medium .",
    "something similar can happen for sgrbs , under the condition that a short time ( of the order of myrs ) separates the supernova explosions which gave origin to the compact objects in the primordial binary system progenitor and its coalescence , with the result that the burst would occur inside its host galaxy and near its star forming birthplace ( perna & belczynski 2002 ) .",
    "such formation channel of `` fast merging '' primordial binaries is in agreement with the observed redshift distribution of our _ complete _ sample discussed above .",
    "indeed , the only case for which combined x - ray and optical afterglow spectroscopy could be performed for a genuine sgrbs ( grb130603b , which is included in our sample ) , provided evidence for a progenitor with short delay time or a low natal kick ( de ugarte postigo et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "sgrbs originated by double compact object systems which experienced a large natal kick or which are dynamically formed in globular clusters are expected to be associated with a low - density environments . as shown in table  4",

    ", we can estimate that at least 10% of the events of our sample are originated by coalescing binaries formed via the dynamical channel ( or having experienced a large natal kick ) .",
    "furthermore , three ( out of five ) events of the _ complete _ sample missing a robust redshift measure ( grb061201 , grb080503 , grb090515 ) have no detected host galaxy coincident with the afterglow position in spite of the precise ( sub - arcsecond ) location and the deep magnitude limits ( berger 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "as discussed in berger ( 2010 ) `` hostless '' sgrbs may lie at moderately high redshifts @xmath100 , and have faint hosts , or represent a population where the progenitor has been kicked out from its host or is sited in an outlying globular cluster . a statistical study carried out recently by tunnicliffe et al .",
    "( 2014 ) pointed out that the proximity of these events to nearby galaxies is higher than is seen for random positions on the sky , in contrast with the high redshift scenario . following this interpretation ,",
    "up to 4 events ( 25% of the sgrbs of the _ complete _ sample ) might have occurred in low - density environments .",
    "finally , we remark that the _ complete _ sample presented in this paper is built by selecting the events with a bright prompt emission that , according to the standard grb model , is independent on the type of circumburst environment .     of the bat6 sample ( data taken from campana et al .",

    "these events lay in the faint end of the @xmath103ray fluences distribution suggesting that their lack of an x - ray afterglow is likely due to the intrinsic faintness of the prompt emission , although a high redshift origin for these events can not be excluded .",
    "- compared to bright lgrbs ( bat6 sample ) the spectral hardness of the sgrbs of the _ complete _ sample seems to be mainly due to a harder low energy spectral component present in short bursts , rather than to a higher peak energy .    -",
    "all the sgrbs of our _ complete _ sample are consistent with the @xmath35 and the @xmath104 correlations , with the significant exception of grb080905a .",

    "such effect might be indicative of a lower radiative efficiency of the sgrb central engine related to the different progenitor or be the consequence of a different circumburst medium for long and short grbs .    - in light of its duration , prompt emission and x - ray afterglow properties , grb100816a ( initially classified as a sgrb ) is likely a long - duration event .",
    "no firm conclusion can be derived for the classification of grb090426 , mainly due to the lack of strong constraints on the properties of its prompt emission spectrum .",
    "- the redshift distribution of the sgrbs of our sample has a mean value of @xmath111 .",
    "no evidence for a different environment for long and short grbs can be derived from the rest - frame x - ray column densities . when compared on the same redhift bin ,",
    "the distributions for long and short grbs are fully comparable .",
    "both these results are consistent with the scenario of `` primordial binary '' progenitors , with short coalescence times .",
    "however , a minor contribution ( 10%25% ) of dynamically formed ( or with large natal kicks ) compact binaries progenitors can not be excluded .",
    "the _ complete _ sample of sgrbs presented in this paper consists of 16 events observed by the _ swift _ satellite over 8.5 years .",
    "as can be evinced from table  1 , the efficiency of redshift measurements almost doubled ( from @xmath90 to @xmath112 ) in the last 5.5 years ( since 2008 ) .",
    "this is likely due to the improving procedures of automatic follow - up from the ground and to the advent of effective facilities like grond ( greiner et al .",

    "2012 ) . as a consequence of this , within a few years of further _ swift _ operations we will handle a well - selectd sample of @xmath113 sgrbs with a redshift completeness higher than 70% . with such numbers , the statistics of this sgrb sample will become comparable to , e.g. , the lgrb bat6 sample , opening the possibility to study , e.g. , the sgrbs luminosity function and measuring their intrinsic extinction through their optical and near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( salvaterra et al . 2012 ; covino et al .",
