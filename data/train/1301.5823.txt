    "the success of the quark model of hadrons and the discovery of point - like partons in nucleons and scaling of the cross sections in deep - inelastic scattering experiments led to the development of quantum chromodynamics qcd .",
    "ordinary hadron matter is composed of hadrons in which the constituent quarks and gluons are confined .",
    "it was soon conjectured that at high temperature and/or pressure hadrons would dissolve into quasi - free quarks and gluons @xcite the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the development of qcd calculations on the lattice then allowed to explore the non - perturbative aspects of the theory , namely the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter . as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ]  left , the existence region of hadrons at low temperature t and baryochemical potential @xmath0 is thought to be separated from the qgp phase at high t by a first order phase boundary ( shaded band ) , which ends in a critical point e and then turns into a crossover at low @xmath0 .",
    "the experimental investigation of the phase diagram and of the properties of the qgp is the main purpose of the study of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "pb+pb reactions were investigated at the cern sps since 1994 by a variety of experiments in the available energy range from 158@xmath1 down to 20@xmath1  gev ( @xmath2 17.3  6.3 gev ) . at top energy",
    "an initial energy density of @xmath3  3  gev/@xmath4  @xcite was found , sufficient for deconfinement .",
    "many of the predicted signatures for the qgp were observed  @xcite , e.g. enhancement of strangeness production due to the smaller mass of strangeness carriers ( s  quark versus @xmath5  meson ) , suppression of charmonium production in excess of cold nuclear matter effects due to screening of the color force , indication of photon emission from annihilation of the copious quarks and antiquarks in the qgp and strong modification of the @xmath6  meson line shape possibly connected to chiral restoration .",
    "however , none of these signatures turned out to be uniquely attributable to the qgp .",
    "the na49 collaboration therefore proposed an energy scan ( t and @xmath0 at freezeout increases respectively decreases with collisions energy ) in order to look for a sharp change in hadron production properties which were predicted to signal the onset of deconfinement at the early stage of evolution of the collision fireball  @xcite .",
    "in fact , these signals were observed by na49  @xcite and their system size dependence is under study by the successor expeiment na61  @xcite .",
    "the data from the energy scan also allowed to start the search for the predicted critical point cp .",
    "first tantalising hints obtained by na49 are presently pursued by experiment na61  @xcite with a two dimensional scan of the phase diagram in nuclear size a and energy , by which the freezeout point is moved in t and @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram](right ) ) .",
    "the expected signature of the cp is a maximum of fluctuations in the produced final state when freezeout occurs close to the cp location  @xcite .",
    "the results discussed in this section were mostly obtained by na49 which was the only experiment to participate in the entire energy scan at the sps ( 1999  2002 ) .",
    "measurements are thus restricted to charged hadrons detected in the large acceptance na49 apparatus  @xcite consisting of time projection chambers ( tpc ) as the principal detectors .",
