    "the dynamical relationship between predators and preys , most simply described by lotka - volterra - type ordinary differential equations , has been investigated widely in recent years .",
    "one well known mathematical model describing this relationship is the rosenzweig - macarthur extension of the classical lotka - volterra model , see e.g. @xcite , in which various interaction rates between the populations have nonlinear dependence on the prey concentration according to @xmath0 here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 denotes the population densities of prey and predator , respectively , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive parameters .",
    "the biological meanings of the parameters are the following : @xmath5 is the intrinsic growth rate of the prey ; @xmath6 is the prey carrying capacity ; @xmath7 is the maximal consumption rate of predators ; @xmath8 is the amount of prey needed to achieve one - half of @xmath7 ; @xmath4 is the per capita death rate of predators ; and @xmath9 is the efficiency with which predators convert consumed prey into new predators .    in this paper ,",
    "we prove analytical estimates of the size of a limit cycle in the following version of system : @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the population densities of prey and predator , respectively .",
    "we will focus on the dynamics of system when the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 take on small values , namely , we assume @xmath15 in order to describe the simple relation between the above rosenzweig - macarthur system in and the more standard version given in , we observe that by introducing the scaled time @xmath16 , the state variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the parameters @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath14 according to @xmath18 the standard system in transforms to system when @xmath19 .",
    "rosenzweig - macarthur systems incorporate logistic growth of the prey in the absence of predators and a holling type ii functional response ( michaelis - menten kinetics ) for interaction between predators and preys .",
    "a literature survey shows that the model has been widely used in real life ecological applications , see e.g. @xcite , including the spatiotemporal dynamics of an aquatic community of phytoplankton and zooplankton @xcite as well as dynamics of microbial competition @xcite .    from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the dynamics of systems of type and has been frequently studied , see e.g. @xcite and the references therein . in particular , system always has a unique positive equilibrium at @xmath20 which attracts the whole positive space when @xmath21 . at @xmath22",
    "there is a hopf bifurcation in which the equilibrium loses stability and a stable limit cycle , surrounding the equilibrium , is created . in particular , for @xmath23 the equilibrium is a source and the cycle attracts the whole positive space ( except the source ) , @xcite .",
    "our main results are analytical estimates of the size of this unique limit cycle when parameters values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 are small .",
    "namely , we assume and in such cases the amplitude of the cycle becomes large and @xmath24 and @xmath25 may become very small during a large portion of the cycle .",
    "biologically , this means that the modeled population exhibits small predator and prey abundances , indicating that the population suffers a relatively high risk of going extinct because of random perturbations .",
    "this underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics of systems of type under assumption . to further motivate our analytical estimates",
    ", we mention that it is notrivial to obtain accurate numerical results by integrating the equations using standard numerical methods when @xmath13 and @xmath14 are small , see section [ sec : numerics ] .    before stating our main results ,",
    "let us note that the above rosenzweig - macarthur systems are very simplified models of reality and therefore usually not directly applicable in biology without modifications .",
    "for example , it is clear from our main results that in model predator and prey populations can decrease to unacceptable low abundances and still survive .",
    "however , we believe that even though our main results are proved for such simple models , they may be useful when investigating dynamics also in more complex and realistic systems , such as , e.g. , systems modeling the interactions of several predators and one prey , or seasonally dependent systems , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "our main results are summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ th : main ] let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be the maximal @xmath24- and @xmath25-values and let @xmath28 and @xmath29 be the minimal @xmath24- and @xmath25-values in the unique limit cycle of system under assumption ( [ pk ] ) .",
    "then the predator density satisfies @xmath30 and the prey density satisfies @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33    from the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 in theorem [ th : main ] we conclude that @xmath36 therefore , theorem [ th : main ] yields the following remark .",

    "if both @xmath13 and @xmath14 are small , then the estimate @xmath39 is good for the minimal prey biomass of the unique limit cycle .    before discussing the outline of the proof of theorem [ th : main ] , we state its analogue for the more standard version of the rosenzweig - macarthur system given in as a corollary . in this",
    "setting , assumption takes the form @xmath40 the biological meaning of the first two inequalities is that the half saturation rate for predators ( @xmath8 ) is assumed small compared to the carrying capacity of the prey ( @xmath6 ) , and that the death rate of predators ( @xmath4 ) is assumed small compared to the growth rate of the prey ( @xmath5 ) times @xmath41 .",
    "the third assumption in says that the growth rate of the prey ( @xmath5 ) equals the difference between the efficiency of the predators ( @xmath9 ) and the death rate of predators ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "theorem [ th : main ] immediately implies the following result .",
    "[ th : main * ] let @xmath42 and @xmath43 be the maximal predator and prey densities and let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the minimal predator and prey densities of the unique limit cycle in system under assumption",

    "the proof of theorem [ th : main ] consists of constructions of several lyapunov - type functions and derivation of a large number of non - trivial estimates .",
    "we believe that these methods and constructions have values also beyond this paper as they present methods and ideas that , potentially , can be useful for proving analogous results for dynamics in similar systems as well as in more complex systems .",
    "the proof is constructed in a way such that theorem [ th : main ] is a direct consequence of four statements , namely statement 1 - 4 , which we prove in sections [ sec : region1 ] , [ sec : region23 ] and [ sec : region4 ] .",
    "in addition to the estimates in theorem [ th : main ] it is also possible to find , from these statements , a positively invariant region trapping the unique limit cycle inside .",
    "in fact , the limit cycle will be inside an outer boundary consisting of the part of a trajectory @xmath57 with initial condition @xmath58 and the part of @xmath59 between @xmath60 and the next intersection with @xmath59 when @xmath61 .",
    "it will also be outside an inner boundary consisting of the part of a trajectory @xmath62 with initial condition @xmath63 and the part of @xmath59 between @xmath64 and the next intersection with @xmath59 when @xmath61 .",
    "estimates for these boundaries can be found from given statements and lemmas , even if we do not write them explicitly here .",
    "we also point out that better but more complicated estimates than those summarized in theorem [ th : main ] follow from lemmas which are used for the proof of statements 1 - 4 and theorem 1 .    to outline the proof of theorem [ th : main ] we first observe that the coordinate axes are invariant , and hence the region @xmath65 is also invariant .",
    "therefore , we consider solutions only for positive @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , system has isoclines at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which leads us to split the proof by introducing the following four regions :    * region 1 , where @xmath68 and @xmath24 is growing and @xmath25 decreasing .",

    "any trajectory starting in region 1 will enter region 2 from where it will enter region 3 and then region 4 and finally region 1 again , and the behaviour repeats infinitely .",
    "figure [ figdok ] illustrates the four regions together with isoclines and points which will be used in the proof of theorem [ th : main ] .",
