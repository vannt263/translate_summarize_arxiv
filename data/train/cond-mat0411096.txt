    "in any superconductor there are impurities either present naturally or systematically produced using the proton or electron irradiation . the inhomogeneities both on the microscopic and the mesoscopic scale greatly affect thermodynamic and especially dynamic properties of type ii superconductors in magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field penetrates the sample in a form of abrikosov vortices , which can be pinned by disorder .",
    "in addition thermal fluctuations also greatly influence the vortex matter in high @xmath3 superconductors , for example in some cases thermal fluctuations will effectively reduce the effects of disorder . as a result",
    "the @xmath4 phase diagram of the high @xmath3 superconductors is very complex due to the competition between thermal fluctuations and disorder , and it is still far from being reliably determined , even in the best studied superconductor , the optimally doped @xmath5 superconductor .",
    "@xcite difficulties are both experimental and theoretical . experimentally various phases with various ( frequently overlapping ) names like liquid @xcite ( sometimes differentiated into liquid i and liquid ii @xcite ) , vortex solid ,",
    "bragg glass @xcite ( = pinned solid ) , vortex glass ( = pinned liquid = entangled solid , @xcite the vortex slush @xcite ) , were described . to differentiate various phases one should understand the nature of the phase transitions between them .",
    "although over the years the picture has evolved with various critical and tricritical points appeared and disappeared , several facts become increasingly clear .",
    "the first order @xcite melting line seems to merge with the `` second magnetization peak '' line forming the universal order - disorder phase transition line .",
    "@xcite at the low temperatures the location of this line strongly depends on disorder and generally exhibits a positive slope ( termed also the `` inverse '' melting zeldov01 ) , while in the `` melting '' section it is dominated by thermal fluctuations and has a large negative slope .",
    "the resulting maximum at which the magnetization and the entropy jump vanish was interpreted either as a tricritical point @xcite or a kauzmann point .",
    "lidisorder this universal `` order - disorder '' transition line ( odt ) , which appeared first in the strongly layered superconductors ( @xmath6 zeldov96 ) was extended to the moderately anisotropic superconductors ( @xmath7 @xcite ) and to the more isotropic ones like @xmath5 .",
    "lidisorder , grover the symmetry characterization of the transition is clear : spontaneous breaking of the translation and rotation symmetry .",
    "the universal `` order - disorder '' line is different from the `` irreversibility line '' or the `` glass '' transition ( gt ) line , which is a continuous transition .",
    "@xcite the almost vertical glass line clearly represents effects of disorder although the thermal fluctuations affect the location of the transition .",
    "experiments in @xmath6 @xcite indicate that the line crosses the odt line right at its maximum , continues deep into the ordered ( bragg ) phase .",
    "this proximity of the glass line to the kauzmann point is reasonable since both signal the region of close competition of the disorder and the thermal fluctuations effects . in more isotropic materials the data are more confusing . in @xmath8",
    "@xcite the gt line is closer to the `` melting '' section of the odt line still crossing it . in ybco",
    "we are not aware of a claim that the gt line continuous into the ordered phase .",
    "most of experiments @xcite indicate that the gt line terminates at the `` tricritical point '' in the vicinity of the maximum of the odt line .",
    "it is more difficult to characterize the nature of the gt transition as a `` symmetry breaking '' .",
    "the common wisdom is that `` replica '' symmetry is broken in the glass ( either via `` steps '' or via `` hierarchical '' continuous process ) as in the most of the spin glasses theories .",
    "@xcite    theoretically the problem of the vortex matter subject to thermal fluctuations or disorder has a long history .",
    "an obvious candidate to model the disorder is the ginzburg - landau model in which coefficients have random components . however this model is too complicated and simplifications are required .",
    "the original idea of the vortex glass and the continuous glass transition exhibiting the glass scaling of conductivity diverging in the glass phase appeared early in the framework of the frustrated @xmath9 model ( the gauge glass ) .",
    "@xcite in this approach one fixes the amplitude of the order parameter retaining the magnetic field with random component added to the vector potential .",
    "it  was studied by the rg and the variational methods and has been extensively simulated numerically .",
    "olsson , hu in analogy to the theory of spin glass the replica symmetry is broken when crossing the gt line .",
    "the model ran into several problems ( see giamarchi and bhattacharya in ref . for a review ) : for finite penetration depth @xmath10 it has no transition bokilyoung and there was a difficulty to explain sharp bragg peaks observed in the experiments at low magnetic fields . to address the last problem",
    "another simplified model had been proven to be more convenient : the elastic medium approach to a collection of interacting line - like objects subject to both the pinning potential and the thermal bath langevin force .",
    "@xcite the resulting theory was treated again using the gaussian approximation @xcite and rg.@xcite the result was that in @xmath11 there is a transition to a glassy phase in which the replica symmetry is broken following the hierarchical pattern  ( in @xmath12 the breaking is one step ) .",
    "the problem of the very fast destruction of the vortex lattice by disorder was solved with the vortex matter being in the replica symmetry broken ( rsb ) phase and it was termed bragg glass . @xcite  it is possible to address the problem of mesoscopic fluctuation using an approach in which one directly simulates the interacting line - like objects subject to both the pinning potential and the thermal bath langevin force .",
    "@xcite in this context the generalized replicated density functional theory menon02 was also applied resulting in one step rsb solution .",
    "although the above approximations to the disordered gl theory are very useful in more fluctuating  superconductors like @xmath6 , a problem arises with their application to @xmath5 at temperature close @xmath13 ( where most of the experiments mentioned above are done ) : vortices are far from being line - like and even their cores significantly overlap . as a consequence",
    "the behavior of the dense vortex matter is expected to be different from that of a system of pointlike vortices and of the @xmath9 model although the elastic medium approximation might still be meaningful .",
    "brandt    to describe the non - pointlike vortices , one has to return to the gl model and make a different simplification .",
    "one of the most developed schemes is the lowest landau level ( lll ) approximation valid close to the @xmath14 line .",
    "@xcite such an attempt was made by dorsey , fisher and huang @xcite in the liquid phase using the dynamic approach sompolinsky and by tesanovic and herbut  for columnar defects in layered materials using supersymmetry .",
    "@xcite it is the purpose of this paper to study the glass transition using the replica formalism .",
    "we quantitatively study the glass transition in the same model , with the disorder represented by the random component of the coefficients of the gl free energy .",
    "the most general hierarchical homogeneous ( liquid ) ansatz @xcite and its stability are considered to obtain the glass transition line and to determine the nature of the transition for various values of the disorder strength of the gl coefficients .",
    "then we place the glass line on the phase diagram of ybco and compare with experiments and other theories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the general disordered gl model is introduced in section ii and the gaussian variational replica method is presented in section iii .",

    "so that the lll approximation is valid ) emerges , see schematic diagram fig .",
    "3 . there are two independent transition lines .",
    "_ 1 . the positional order - disorder line . _",
    "the unified first order universal order - disorder line comprising the melting and the second peak sections separates the homogeneous and the crystalline ( bragg ) phases .",
    "the transition is therefore defined by the translation and rotation symmetry only , and the intensity of the first bragg peak can be taken as order parameter .",
    "the broken symmetry is not directly related to pinning , however the location of the line is _ _",
    "_ _ sensitive to disorder .",
    "one sees on fig.3 that as the disorder strength @xmath86 increases the melting line ( solid line ) curves down at lower point merging with the second peak segment .",
    "the effect of disorder is quite minor in the high temperature region , in which the thermal fluctuations dominate , but become dominant at low temperatures .",
    "the line makes a wiggle near the experimentally claimed critical point .",
    "the critical point  is reinterpreted @xcite as a ( noncritical ) kauzmann point in which the latent heat vanishes and the line is parallel to the @xmath252 axis in the low temperature region . the surprising wiggle , which appears in 3d only , has actually been observed in some experiments .",
    "@xcite it is located precisely in the region in which the thermal fluctuations and the disorder compete .",
    "one might expect that the line just has a maximum like in @xmath253 but the situation might be more complex",
    ". thermal fluctuations , on the one hand side , make the disorder less effective , the less disorder effect will favor solid , but , on the other hand side , they themselves melt the solid .",
    "the theoretical magnetization , the entropy and the specific heat discontinuities at melting line @xcite compare well with experiments @xcite . the low temperature segment of the disorder dominated second peak line is weakly temperature dependent .",
    "its field strongly decreases as the disorder strength increases .",
    "_ 2 . the glass transition line . _",
    "the second line is the glass transition line , the dashed line in fig.3 .",
    "we assume very small @xmath246 and draw on fig.3 the glass lines for three different values of @xmath254 one observes as expected , that , as the disorder strength increases , the line moves towards higher temperatures .",
    "we have not calculated the glass line in the crystalline state , but anticipate that it depends little on the crystalline order .",
    "this is consistent with observations made in ref . in which it was noticed ( in a bit different context of layered materials and columnar defects ) that lateral modulation makes a very small difference to the glass line although it is obviously very important for the location of the order - disorder line .",
    "so we just continue the glass line in the homogeneous phase into the crystalline side ( still marking it by a dotted lines ) .",
    "if the glass lines of the liquid side and solid side join to a single glass line , then the glass line must cross the odt line right at the kauzmann point . the theoretical calculated intersection point in fig .",
    "3 marked by black blob do not appear at the kauzmann point .",
    "we attribute this to different approximations made to draw the odt  and gt line .",
    "that the glass line crosses the odt line right at the kauzmann point has been indeed supported by some evidences in an experiment in @xmath6 @xcite , thought two lines crossing exactly at the kauzmann point or not is still an open question experimentally and theoretically .",
    "consequently there are four different phases , see fig .",
    "4 : pinned solid (= bragg glass ) , pinned liquid ( = vortex glass ) , unpinned solid ( or simply solid ) and unpinned liquid ( or simply liquid ) . the four phases of the vortex matter are also expected to be present in the case of layered quasi 2d superconductors and it was shown by in @xmath6 in that the conductivity and the magnetization both indicate the glass line crossing the odt line near the maximum ( kauzmann point ) .",
    "there is evidence of the crossing of the odt and gt line also in @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath5 @xcite , but the line seems to lie very close to the melting line ( the segment of odt line in the high temperature ) . in ref .",
    "a great care was paid to distinguish the two lines , and it was found that at low field the gt line crosses again the melting line so that the lower field segment of the melting line is again separating two glassy or pinned states .",
    "now we compare the results on the phase diagram with other theories .",
    "the only known theory providing both the odt and the glass lines is the density functional model .",
    "the picture advocated in ref . on basis of the replica density functional calculation in the framework of thermodynamics of pinned line objects is qualitatively different from the present one . in this theory",
    "the glass line does not intersect the odt line and therefore there is no unpinned solid phase .",
    "the comparison of the theory studied in this paper with the replica density functional theory is complicated by the fact that the applicability ranges of two theories are different .",
    "in addition there are other phenomenological approaches , most notably that of ref .",
    "@xcite , based on lindermann criterion to map the odt line .",
    "we plot the odt and the glass transition line in fig . 5 along with the experimental data on optimally doped @xmath5 of ref . .",
    "the theoretical lines use the fitting parameters of  ref . which fitted the odt line and assume the @xmath170 disorder strength @xmath246 is small .",
    "we believe the value of this parameter should be measured directly using a replica symmetry breaking dynamical phenomenon rather than fitted in thermodynamics , though it might be possible to adjust @xmath246 , so that the curve can fit the glass transition line better than the case of @xmath99 . as was argued in ( and found to be consistent with experiments on the odt line and the magnetization , entropy and specific heat discontinuities at melting line ) that the general dependence of the disorder strength on temperature near @xmath3 is : @xmath255 with @xmath256 .",
    "the formula interpolates the one used at lower temperatures in ref . with our dimensionless pinning parameter @xmath86 ( proportional to the pinning centers density ) related to the pinning strength  of blatter @xmath257 @xmath258 @xcite by @xmath259 .",
    "note that experimentally the glass transition line at lower fields is not measured precisely .",
    "different experiments locate it at various places using different criteria .",
    "as mentioned above experimentally the gt line often crosses the melting line again at very low fields .",
    "this question perhaps can not be addressed within the lowest landau level approximation valid at fields above @xmath260 the odt line in the melting region is very well established experimentally by great variety of techniques .",
    "however the `` second peak '' segment is only poorly determined due to difficulty to define it in the essentially dynamic magnetization loops analysis .",
    "recently developed muon spin rotation and neutron scattering methods might be very helpful in that respect .",
    "to summarize we considered the effects of both thermal fluctuations and disorder in the framework of the gl approach using the replica formalism . flux line lattice in type ii superconductors",
    "undergoes a transition****into three disordered  phases : vortex liquid ( not pinned ) , homogeneous vortex glass ( the pinned liquid or the vortex glass ) and the bragg glass ( pinned solid ) due to both thermal fluctuations and random quenched disorder .",
    "we show that the disordered ginzburg  landau model ( valid not very far from @xmath261 ) in which only the coefficient of a term quadratic in order parameter @xmath1 is random , first considered by dorsey , fisher and huang , leads to a state with nonzero edwards - anderson order parameter , but this state is still replica symmetric .",
    "namely there is no ergodicity breaking and no multiple time scales in dynamics are expected . however ,",
    "when the coefficient of the quartic term in @xmath1 in the  gl free energy also has a random component , replica symmetry breaking effects appear ( with ergodicity breaking ) .",
    "the location of the glass transition line in 3d materials is determined and compared to experiments .",
    "the line is clearly different from both the melting line and the second peak line describing the translational and rotational symmetry breaking at high and low temperatures respectively .",
    "the phase diagram is therefore separated by two lines into four phases mentioned above . in principle",
    "we could obtain the rsb solution near the phase transition line by expanding the equations around the phase transition line as in the spin glass theory , see , for example ref . , and we found that the rsb is continuous .",
    "thus rsb states involve multiple time scales in relaxation phenomena .",
    "it is natural to expect and is confirmed that the glass ( irreversibility ) line crosses the order - disorder  line not very far from its kauzmann point .",
    "we are not sure if the crossing is right at kauzmann point .",
    "if two gt lines ( on liquid side and solid side ) are joined , the crossing must be right at the kauzmann point .",
    "we believe ( speculate ) that the glass line should cross the order - disorder  line right at the kauzmann point if the experiments can be done accurately and the theory shall confirm it if the model can be solved exactly .",
    "it is of great interest to solve a solvable toy model to test this idea .",
    "the kauzmann point is a point in which the magnetization and the entropy difference between solid and liquid phases changes sign . in this region",
    "the positive slope disorder dominated second peak segment joins the thermal fluctuations dominated negative slope melting segment .",
    "this is the region in which effects of the disorder and of the thermal fluctuation are roughly of the same strength .",
    "the replica symmetry breaking solution found here can be used to calculate the detailed properties inside the glass state .",
    "this however require generalization of the theory to include dynamics , since most of irreversible phenomena are time dependent .",
    "in particular it would be interesting to estimate the time scales associated with quenched disorder .",
    "this is left for a future work .",
    "also we have considered only the three dimensional gl model here .",
    "it can be applied to superconductors with rather small anisotropy .",
    "it would be interesting to generalize the calculation to the lawrence - doniach model and to the two dimensional case describing thermal fluctuations and disorder in more anisotropic layered superconductors and thin films ..    we are grateful to e.h .",
