    "the u - cas is an ingenious device that hovers in mid - air while spinning .",
    "it is marketed as a kit in japan under the trade name u - cas @xcite , and in the u.s.a . and",
    "europe under the trade name levitron@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the whole kit consists of three main parts : a magnetized top which weighs about @xmath15 gr , a thin ( lifting ) plastic plate and a magnetized square base plate ( base ) . to operate the top",
    "one should set it spinning on the plastic plate that covers the base .",
    "the plastic plate is then raised slowly with the top until a point is reached in which the top leaves the plate and spins in mid - air above the base for about 2 min .",
    "the hovering height of the top is approximately @xmath16 cm above the surface of the base whose dimensions are about 10 cm @xmath17 10 cm @xmath17 2 cm .",
    "the kit comes with extra brass and plastic fine tuning weights , as the apparatus is very sensitive to the weight of the top .",
    "it also comes with two wedges to balance the base horizontally .",
    "the physical principle underlying the operation of the u - cas relies on the so - called ` adiabatic approximation ' @xcite : as the top is launched , its magnetic moment points _ antiparallel _ to the magnetization of the base in order to supply the repulsive magnetic force which will act against the gravitational pull . as the top hovers , it experiences lateral oscillations which are slow ( @xmath18 hz ) compared to its precession ( @xmath19 hz ) .",
    "the latter itself , is small compared to the top s spin ( @xmath20 hz ) . since @xmath21 the top is considered ` fast ' and acts like a classical spin .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath22 this spin may be considered as experiencing a _ slowly _ rotating magnetic field . under these circumstances the spin precesses around the _ local _ direction of the magnetic field @xmath23 ( adiabatic approximation ) and , on the average , its magnetic moment @xmath24 points _ antiparallel _ to the local magnetic field lines . in view of this discussion , the magnetic interaction energy which is normally given by @xmath25",
    "is now given approximately by @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the overall effective energy ` seen ' by the top is @xmath27 where @xmath10 is the mass of the top , @xmath11 is the free - fall acceleration and @xmath28 is the height of the top above the base . by virtue of the adiabatic approximation , two of the three rotational degrees of freedom",
    "are coupled to the transverse translational degrees of freedom , and as a result the rotation of the axis of the top is already incorporated in eq.([energy ] ) .",
    "thus , under the adiabatic approximation , the top may be considered as a _ point - like _ particle whose only degrees of freedom are translational .",
    "the important point of this discussion is the following : the energy expression written above _ possesses a minimum _ for certain values of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , when the mass is properly tuned , the apparatus acts as a trap , and stable hovering becomes possible .",
    "a detailed description of this device , extending beyond the adiabatic approximation , may be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , the adiabatic approximation will suffice .",
    "in this paper we focus on the question : @xmath30 first , we define what do we mean by ` height ' : we assume that the top hovers above some horizontal plane . the height of the top is measured with respect to that plane .",
    "the ` rules of the game ' are , that we can put permanent magnet _ below _ the plane , but never _ above _ this plane . whatever is below this plane ,",
    "will be called ` the base ' .",
    "the method we use to answer the question above will be by getting upper and lower _",
    "bounds _ for this height , denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by pointing out the factors that limit the hovering height of the u - cas .",
    "first , we set aside the question of stability and assume that the top is guided by a vertical axis , allowing it to move only axially ( up and down ) . in this case ,",
    "the easiest way to increase @xmath13the hovering height , is by using a more powerful magnet for the base .",
    "this technique however , can not be applied indefinitely since there is no way to increase the magnetization of a given substance without limit .",
    "we are therefore forced to limit the strength of @xmath31the magnetization density of the base , to some maximum value , say @xmath9 , and design the shape and magnetization density of the base so as to maximize @xmath13 .",
    "one more factor that limits the levitation height is the amount of magnetic substance , or _",
    ", in our disposal . clearly , the more material we use , the larger is the levitation height that can be achieved .",
    "but still , even if the volume is infinite the levitation height is bounded , since @xmath32 is bounded .",
    "when stability is taken into account , things get more complicated .",
    "stability sets another limitation on the design of the base , in _ addition _ to the limitations that were discussed above : a brief look at eq.([energy ] ) tells us that for the top to hover _ stably _ over the plate , the effective energy @xmath33 should possess a _",
    "minimum_. this means , in particular , that @xmath34 where the derivatives are evaluated at the equilibrium position of the top . since these are _ homogenous _ inequalities , it is clear that the region in space where a minimum _ may _ occur , does not depend on the _ strength _ of the magnetic field . as a consequence ,",
    "the hovering height of the u - cas  is _ not _ determined by the strength of the magnetic field but on its _ geometry , _ or alternatively , by the _ shape _ of the base . as an example , it has been shown @xcite that for a vertically magnetized base in the shape of a disk of radius @xmath35 , the range of heights @xmath13 for which stable hovering is possible , is very narrow and is around @xmath36 .",
    "this result agrees roughly with the parameters of the u - cas , for which @xmath37 cm and @xmath38 cm , when @xmath13 is measured from the center - of - mass of the base .",
    "the _ strength _ of the field then comes into play by tuning it in order to achieve equilibrium for a given mass of the top .",
    "equilibrium prevails when the total force on the top vanishes , i.e. when @xmath39    both in the guided case and in the stable case , we see that in order to increase the hovering height of the u - cas , we should design a better base .",
    "we do expect however , that the hovering height can not be increased indefinitely . in connection with the redesigning of the base , we have recently shown @xcite , both theoretically and experimentally , that the use of a vertically magnetized _ ring _ of radius @xmath35 as a base , increases the hovering height by more than three times to about @xmath40!. this increase in height did not came without cost , as the tolerance on the mass of the top became more stringent , being @xmath41 for the ring vs. @xmath42 in the case of the disk @xcite .",
    "all the calculations that we do are outlined in sec.([sec2 ] ) .",
    "we will now describe what we calculate and what is the motivation behind it .",
    "we start in sec.([sec2.1 ] ) , by deriving a close form expression for the first and second derivatives of the magnetic field , in terms of the magnetization density of the base .",
    "the first derivative is the magnetic force on the top , which is used throughout the paper , while the second derivative is exploited when we discuss stability .    in sec.([sec2.2 ] ) we consider the problem of maximizing the hovering height in the case where the _ volume _ of the base may be _ infinite _ , and may be _ arbitrarily _ magnetized under the constraint that @xmath43 .",
    "we still _ do not _ require that the top be stable against lateral translations , and assume that it is guided along a vertical axis .",
    "we show that in this case @xmath44 where @xmath5 is a characteristic height for the problems that are discussed in this paper . it is defined as @xmath45 where @xmath7 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum",
    ", @xmath8 is the magnetic moment of the top , @xmath10 is the mass of the top , and @xmath11 is the free - fall acceleration .    in sec.([sec2.3 ] ) we consider the same problem as before but for a base which is _ uniformly _ magnetized along the vertical direction , namely @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a unit vector in the vertical direction . in this case",
    "we find that @xmath48    in order to arrive to better bounds on @xmath0 , our next step is to limit the amount of material available for the base .",
    "thus , in sec.([sec2.4 ] ) we maximize the hovering height in the case where the base may be _ arbitrarily _ magnetized under the constraint that @xmath43 , and that its _ volume _ @xmath49 is given . here , the result is given in the form of a plot , showing the dependence @xmath50 on @xmath49 . in the limit @xmath51 , we recover the result of sec.([sec2.2 ] ) .",
    "our derivation is also _ constructive _ in the sense that it shows how to _ construct _ the optimal base for a given @xmath49 . in this paper",
    "however , we do not discuss this matter thoroughly due to space shortage .    for completeness",
    ", we study in sec.([sec2.5 ] ) the same problem as in sec.([sec2.4 ] ) , but for a _ uniformly _ magnetized base . here , again we find the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath49 and recover the result of sec.([sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "sec.([sec2.6 ] ) is the first part where stability is added into play : we begin by explaining how to _ test _ for stability of the top under the adiabatic approximation , and study the possible levitation heights of a _ uniformly _ magnetized base whose shape is _ cylindrical _ of volume @xmath49 . as the stability condition is given in the form of inequality relations ( see eq.([stab ] ) )",
    ", it is not suffice to determine uniquely  the levitation height .",
    "we therefore choose to study two particular stable points : an _ isotropic _ stable point and the _ highest _ possible stable point .",
    "the meaning of these points would become clear later . in this case",
    "we also give a plot , showing the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath49 .",
    "this result should also be considered as a lower bound for @xmath0 , since the cylindrical base is a special case of all the base configurations that are possible .    in section([sec2.7 ] ) we take one step further , and generalize the result of section([sec2.6 ] ) to the case of a base which may be _ arbitrarily _ magnetized , and look for the _ lowest _ possible stable point . in this case however , we assume that @xmath52 , to ease the solution of the problem . we also show that in this case , where @xmath53 and @xmath52 , the _ lowest _ possible stable point and the _ highest _ one coincide , so this result represent not a _ bound _ for @xmath0 , but is actually @xmath0 itself , for the case @xmath52 .    in sec.([sec3 ] ) we discuss interesting aspects of our results .",
    "in particular we estimate the value of @xmath5 for modern permanent magnet materials and calculate the values of the bounds for @xmath0 .",
    "we comment on the implications of our results and discuss other related questions .",
    "a simplified model of the u - cas is shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "it consists of a point - like particle of mass @xmath10 and magnetic moment @xmath8 ( pointing downward ) , hovering at a height @xmath13 above the @xmath54 plane . for the moment",
    ", we consider the top as if it was _ guided _ along the @xmath28-axis so that only its vertical motion is allowed .",
    "other degrees of freedom are considered ` frozen ' .",
    "the region @xmath55 may be partially or wholly filled with a magnetized substance ( `` base '' ) , whose magnetization density is denoted by @xmath31 , producing a magnetic field throughout space which we denote by @xmath56 . in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the base ( and hence the magnetic field ) has a cylindrical symmetry around the @xmath28-axis .",
    "thus , along this axis the magnetic field possesses only a @xmath28-component .",
    "we further assume that this component is _ positive _ , namely that the magnetic field along the @xmath28-axis is pointing upward .    using eqs.([energy]),([force ] )",
    "we find that , when the top is in equilibrium , the total vertical component of the force on the top vanishes , @xmath57 where the term @xmath58 is the gravitational force pulling the top towards the base , and the term @xmath59 is the magnetic force which pushes the top upward .",
    "note that @xmath60 should be _",
    "since the top is allowed to move only along the @xmath28-axis , we may write @xmath61 ( in what follows we deserve the notation @xmath62 to denote the @xmath28-component of the magnetic field along the @xmath28-axis , namely @xmath63 ) .",
    "now , the magnetic force on the top simplifies to @xmath64 and hence , when the top is in equilibrium at @xmath65 , @xmath66    reciprocity allows us to express @xmath67 in terms of @xmath31 as @xmath68 here , @xmath69 is the field at the point @xmath70 produced by a unit magnitude dipole pointing _",
    "upward _ , located at a height @xmath28 along the @xmath28-axis . taking @xmath71 and @xmath72 as depicted in fig.([fig1 ] ) , we can write @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a polar unit vector , also defined in fig.([fig1 ] ) , and @xmath7 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum .",
    "it is worth to note that @xmath76 is nothing but the field produced at @xmath70 by a _",
    "quadruple _ located at a height @xmath28 along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "this quadruple is made out of a pair of identical dipoles : one is located at @xmath28 and pointing downward and the other is at an infinitesimally higher position @xmath77 and pointing upward , with their magnetic moment being @xmath78 .    when eq.([eq1.3 ] ) is substituted into eq.([eq1.2 ] ) we find that , at @xmath65 , the field derivative is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and where @xmath81 is a polar unit vector orthogonal to @xmath75 , as is shown in fig.([fig1 ] ) .",
    "we would also need the _ second _ derivative of the field , when we discuss stability .",
    "it is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 note that in both eqs.([eq1.4 ] ) and ( [ eq1.41 ] ) , @xmath84 is defined with respect to a polar coordinate system whose origin is at @xmath65 and _ not _ at @xmath54 .",
    "also note , that in going from eq.([eq1.4 ] ) to eq.([eq1.41 ] ) , one should take into account the dependence of the unit vectors @xmath81 and @xmath85 on @xmath28 .",
    "we consider an infinitesimal volume element at some point @xmath86 within the base .",
    "it is essentially a magnetic dipole whose magnitude is @xmath9 , and whose direction we will now find by the requirement that the magnetic force on the top is maximized .",
    "we have already shown that the _ force _ on the top , contributed by one elemental dipole , is proportional to the magnetic field @xmath73 that would be produced at @xmath86 by a quadruple located at @xmath65 . to make this force maximal we assign to each point @xmath86 in @xmath55 , a magnetization density @xmath31",
    "whose magnitude is @xmath9 and whose direction is _ antiparallel _ to the field line of @xmath73 at that point .",
    "the magnetization density so defined will _",
    "maximize _ the force on the top , and is therefore the requested answer .",
    "mathematically , this procedure amounts to replacing @xmath31 in eq.([eq1.4 ] ) by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is a unit vector _",
    "parallel _ to @xmath89 , the latter being defined in eq.([n ] ) .",
    "the result is @xmath90 for which the @xmath71 integration is trivial and the @xmath72 integration may be brought to a simpler form by the transformation @xmath91 .",
    "this gives @xcite @xmath92 which together with eq.([eq1.1 ] ) shows that @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the characteristic length in our problem which will reappear in the next sections .",
    "the value of @xmath5 may be interpreted as the _ distance _ between two colinear dipoles , one of them is of strength @xmath8 while the other is of strength @xmath95 , for which the mutual force between them is @xmath96 .",
    "eq.([eq1.6 ] ) shows that even though the magnetization direction is allowed to vary everywhere inside the base , the levitation height @xmath13 is bounded .",
    "eq.([eq1.6 ] ) presents the maximum height that can be accomplished with a given substance provided that the top is not allowed to move laterally .",
    "clearly , it also serve as an _ upper _ bound for @xmath0 , as stability was not considered yet .",
    "moreover , note that we have calculated the maximum magnetic force , which is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath97 on the other hand , becomes _ infinite _ at @xmath98 as can be seen by the following simple argument :",
    "since each elemental dipole within the plate contributes a field that goes as @xmath99 and since the volume of integration goes as @xmath100 , the integrand goes as @xmath101 , for which the integral diverges as @xmath102 .",
    "later we show that the divergence of @xmath97 implies that the top _ can not _ be stable when placed in such a point . in any case , it would be impossible to _ spin _ the top .",
    "uniformly magnetized plates are clearly easier to construct . in this section",
    "we find out what upper bound does this restriction sets on the highest levitation point . in another sense ,",
    "the result of this section may also be considered as a _",
    "lower _ bound on the height of levitation ( for a top which is guided ! ) , provided one considers all possible base configurations .",
    "we again consider an infinitesimal volume element within the base .",
    "it is now oriented along the @xmath28-direction and interacting with the top s magnetic dipole .",
    "if this element is exactly below the top ( i.e. it is located somewhere on the negative * *  * * @xmath28-axis ) , it exerts a repelling @xmath28-directed force on the top , pushing it away . if the element is not exactly below the top then the nature of this force ( i.e. weather it is repulsive or attractive ) is determined by the angle formed between the direction of the two dipoles ( in this case both point in the @xmath28-direction ) , and the direction defined by the line joining these dipoles .",
    "we call this angle @xmath72 , and measure it with respect to the positive @xmath28-direction , as is shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "there exists a critical angle @xmath103 ( see fig.([fig2 ] ) ) , for which the @xmath28-directed force vanishes such that for @xmath104 the force becomes attractive .",
    "it is therefore useless to put any material within the region @xmath104 and @xmath105 since this would _ reduce _ the magnetic force and decrease the levitation height .    to find @xmath103 we eliminate the @xmath28-component of eq.([n ] ) , and find the value of @xmath72 for which it vanishes",
    "we pick the value of @xmath72 that lies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this gives @xmath108    we now evaluate the upward force exerted on the top , by summing the contributions of _ all _ the elements in the base located within @xmath109 . the ( uniform ) magnetization density within this region is taken to be @xmath46 .",
    "using eq.([eq1.4 ] ) , we find that @xmath110\\text{.}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the integration over @xmath71 is again trivial , and we are left with an integration over @xmath72 .",
    "the latter is brought to a simpler form by changing the @xmath72 variable into @xmath111 , hence @xmath112 this result , together with the equilibrium condition eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , suggests that in this case the maximal levitation height possible is @xmath113   \\equiv4\\pi\\left (   \\dfrac{3}{5}\\right ) ^{5/2}l_{0}\\cong3.5l_{0}\\text{. } \\label{eq1.5}%\\ ] ]    note , however , that in order to realize the levitation heights found in this section and in the previous one we would need an unlimited supply of magnetic material . in the following sections we find",

    "thus , the @xmath28-component of the magnetic field along the @xmath28-axis is given by@xcite : @xmath149 where@xmath150   \\text{.}%\\ ] ] we also define the function @xmath151 , to be used later , as@xmath152    we now formulate the conditions for the _ stability _ of the spinning top against both axial and lateral translations : stability in the @xmath28-direction is determined by the sign of the ` spring - constant ' in that direction  @xmath153 . under the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the latter is given by the _ curvature _ of the effective energy along that direction .",
    "hence , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the radial distance , in cylindrical coordinate system , from the @xmath28-axis .",
    "similarly , stability in the lateral direction @xmath156 , is governed by the sign of @xmath157 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last equality use has been made of the cylindrical symmetry of the magnetic field and the fact that @xmath62 and all of its cartesian derivatives are harmonic functions @xcite",
    ".    for the spinning top to be stable against translations , both @xmath153 and @xmath158 should be _ positive_. comparing eq.([eq1.31 ] ) to eq.([eq1.30 ] ) , we see that when @xmath159 , then @xmath158 @xmath160 @xmath161 , and therefore one of the pair @xmath162,@xmath163 _ must _ be negative .",
    "thus , when the magnetic field diverges at a point , a top placed at that point can not be stable .",
    "this proves that the highest hovering height , found in section ( [ sec2.2 ] ) , is not under stable conditions .",
    "the restriction that both @xmath153 and @xmath158 should be positive defines a stable _ region _ along the @xmath28 axis . as an example",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that for a base in the shape of a thin disk of radius @xmath164 , the value of @xmath153 is positive whenever @xmath165 , whereas @xmath158 is positive for @xmath166 .",
    "the region of stability in this case is therefore @xmath167",
    ". within that region there exists a point @xmath168 for which @xmath169 . in the case of the disk",
    "it is @xmath170 .",
    "we call this point the _ isotropically stable _ point because the restoring ( stabilizing ) force which acts on a top , which is tuned to hover at @xmath171 is isotropic , depending only on the deviation from the equilibrium position and not on its direction .    for a general cylinder",
    "we now consider two distinct situations : the first is the one in which the stable point is _ isotropic _ , i.e. a hovering height @xmath13 for which @xmath172 .",
    "the second is the case where @xmath13 is at the verge of stability in the lateral direction .",
    "this is also the _ highest _ stable point , characterized by @xmath173 . using eqs.([eq1.30]),([eq1.31 ] )",
    "we write each of the two distinct conditions as @xmath174 where @xmath175 for the first situation and @xmath176 for the second .    substituting eq.([eq1.27 ] ) into eq.([eq1.32 ] ) defines a functional relationship between @xmath177 and @xmath178 denoted by the function @xmath179,@xmath180 differentiating eq.([eq1.27 ] ) with respect to @xmath28 , setting @xmath65 , and using the equilibrium condition eq.([eq1.1 ] ) , gives @xmath181 where@xmath182 combining it with an expression for the volume , gives @xmath116{c}% \\dfrac{v_{0}}{l_{0}^{3}}=\\dfrac{\\pi r^{2}d}{l_{0}^{3}}=\\pi\\left (   \\dfrac{d}% { r}\\right )   \\left (   \\dfrac{r}{l_{0}}\\right )   ^{3}=\\pi\\dfrac{d}{r}n^{3}\\left ( d / r\\right )   , \\\\ \\dfrac{h}{l_{0}}=\\dfrac{h}{r}\\dfrac{r}{l_{0}}=g(d / r)n\\left (   d / r\\right )   , \\end{array } \\label{eq1.33}%\\ ] ] which expresses the volume @xmath49 and the levitation height @xmath13 in terms of a common variable @xmath178 .",

    "this plot is shown in fig.([plots ] ) where the solid line corresponds to @xmath176 ( the isotropic case ) and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath175 ( the highest stable point ) .",
    "note that both of these plots are _ not _ monotonically increasing .",
    "they possess a maximum of @xmath13 at some optimal volume @xmath183 . for @xmath175",
    "we find that @xmath184 and @xmath185 , whereas for @xmath176 these are @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "this indicates that using too a much material _",
    "worsen _ the largest height that can be achieved , which is reminiscent of our conclusion of sec.([sec2.3 ] ) .",
    "if the given volume is larger than @xmath183 however , we can always use only an amount of volume equal to @xmath183 and discard the rest of the material .",
    "hence , in principal at least , one _ can _ realize the largest possible height , which is why the plots of @xmath13 vs. @xmath49 had been artificially corrected by assigning the maximum value of @xmath13 for the values of @xmath49 that are larger than @xmath183 .",
    "in this last section we consider the case of an infinite base , which may be arbitrarily magnetized , such that the height of levitation is maximized , yet the top is stable against both axial and lateral translations . in order to solve this problem",
    ", one needs to maximize the magnetic force @xmath188 under the constraints that @xmath153 and @xmath158 , defined in eqs.([eq1.30 ] ) and ( [ eq1.31 ] ) respectively , are _ both _ positive .",
    "the last requirement however , results in a non - linear inequality , which can not be solved analytically .",
    "the method we take here is to use the constraint @xmath189 instead , which marks the lower end of the stability region along the @xmath28-axis .",
    "consider an infinitesimal magnetic dipole at the point @xmath86 within the base with magnetization @xmath9 .",

    "( [ eq7 ] ) , that @xmath190 is given by @xmath196    using eq.([eq7.1 ] ) inside eq.([eq6.1 ] ) , and requiring that @xmath197 , gives the equation for @xmath198 @xmath199{c}% 3\\sin\\theta\\left (   5\\cos^{2}\\theta-1\\right )   \\sin\\alpha\\\\ + 4\\cos\\theta(5\\cos^{2}\\theta-3)\\cos\\alpha \\end{array } \\right\\ }   = 0\\text { , } \\label{eq9}%\\ ] ] in which @xmath190 depends on @xmath200 according to @xmath201 note that in eq.([eq9 ] ) the variable @xmath71 has been changed to @xmath202 .",
    "this way the double integration is finite and the singularity in the integrand is eliminated .",
    "the numerical solution of eq.([eq9 ] ) gives @xmath203 using this value inside eq.([eq5 ] ) yields @xmath204 which , together with the equilibrium condition , gives @xmath205    note that , though the gradient of the field is finite , the field itself _ diverges _ , and hence @xmath206 . as @xmath207 in the case we studied here , we conclude that @xmath158 also vanishes .",
    "thus , the lowest stable hovering height and the highest one _ coincide _ , leaving no range of stability . a small relaxation in the conditions however , such as limiting the volume of the material to a finite , though very large value , results in a formation of a finite albeit small , range of stability .",
    "we showed that the maximum levitation height of the u - cas is bounded and is given in terms of a characteristic length @xmath5 , which depends on the properties of the substance that the base and the top are made of .",
    "note also , that @xmath208 where @xmath155 is the mass density of the top , and @xmath209 is its magnetization density .",
    "since @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the residual induction , and since @xmath211 is related to the energy product @xcite via @xmath212 , we may also write @xmath5 as @xmath213 in this form , @xmath5 can be easily estimated from the knowledge of the energy product of the material .",
    "the best candidates for large hovering heights are the nd - fe - b magnets .",
    "an example of which is vacuumschmelze s vacodym 344 hr @xcite , whose remanence ( @xmath211 ) is @xmath214 kgauss and whose density is @xmath215 gr/@xmath216 .",
    "for this magnet , the magnetization is @xmath217 emu/@xmath216 .",
    "thus , with @xmath218 cm / sec@xmath219 , we find that @xmath220 meter .",
    "this gives , according to eq.([eq11 ] ) , a maximum stable hovering height of about @xmath221 meters!. typical values of the energy product , density and corresponding @xmath5 , for modern commercial magnets available today are listed in table i.

    "though this is a very good approximation for modern permanent magnets like rare - earth magnets , its only an approximation even for these . furthermore , the maximum field at the top is limited by its mechanical and magnetic strength : stability considerations show @xcite that the spinning speed of the top while hovering must be greater than @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 are the moments of inertia along the principal and secondary axes , respectively . also , the maximum field at the top is limited by its coercivity as the field is _ opposite _ to the magnetization .",
    "thus , in practice , eq.([eq11 ] ) should be considered as an _ upper bound _ for the maximum hovering height of the u - cas .    yet another way to increase the hovering height of the top is to use current coil for the base , instead of a permanent magnet @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the coil over the magnetic plate is in the fact that one can raise the top to the levitation point by electrical means instead of raising the top mechanically , as in the permanent magnet case . here",
    ", the hovering height is not limited directly by the strength of the magnetic field , but rather by the amount of power that one can deliver into the coil to overcome electrical resistance .",
    "one might argue that the use of superconducting wires for the coil should lift this constraint , but the hovering height is bounded in this case as well , for if the field increases beyond a critical value , the superconductor goes into its normal phase .",
    "we have shown @xcite , that for a given height of levitation @xmath13 , the _ minimum _ power required for levitation is given by @xmath243 here , @xmath244 is the power in watts , @xmath71 is the resistivity in @xmath245 cm , @xmath11 is the free - fall acceleration in @xmath246sec@xmath247 , @xmath248 is the magnetization per unit mass of the top in emu / gr , and @xmath249 is a number of dimensions amp@xmath219emu@xmath219/erg@xmath219cm@xmath219 , and is determined by the _ shape _ and _ current distribution _ of the coil .",
