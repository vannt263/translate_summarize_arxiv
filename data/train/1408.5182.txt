    "a pump converts an external bias into work . we need the average bias to get the work from a macroscopic mechanical pump , but it is known that the average bias to get a pumping current is not necessary in mesoscopic systems .",
    "when a mesoscopic system , thus , is slowly and periodically modulated by several control parameters such as chemical potentials , gate voltages , and tunneling barriers , there exists a net average current without dc bias .",
    "this phenomenon is known as adiabatic pumping , and has been observed in various processes such as quantized charge transport@xcite , spin pumping@xcite , and qubit manipulation@xcite .",
    "the first proposal of adiabatic pumping was given by thouless@xcite for a closed quantum system .",
    "the idea of quantum pumping for closed systems has been extended to open systems@xcite .",
    "such adiabatic pumping processes have been experimentally realized in mesoscopic transport processes@xcite .",
    "it is recognized that the mechanism of adiabatic pumping originates from the geometrical effect of the berry phase in quantum mechanics@xcite , where a circular operation in a parameter space creates a non - zero geometrical quantity associated with the pumping current .",
    "similar phenomena have been studied in stochastic systems described by classical master equations@xcite and quantum master equations@xcite . as indicated in the analysis of classical master equations@xcite , adiabatic pumping",
    "is also characterized by a berry - phase - like quantity , the so - called berry - sinitsyn - nemenman ( bsn ) phase@xcite .",
    "the bsn phase has been extended to the quantum master equation case@xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the bsn phase is directly related to the path - dependent entropy under strong nonequilibrium conditions@xcite , which is an interesting extension of the equilibrium thermodynamics to a nonequilibrium thermodynamics .    most of the previous studies , however , assume that the pumping process is only modulated adiabatically , where the validity of the approximation is ensured if the modulation speed is zero .",
    "this situation is practically useless , because the pumping current under adiabatic modulation is zero in the strict sense .",
    "it is , thus , important to ( i ) clarify the limitation of the adiabatic approximation and ( ii ) analyze the pumping process without the introduction of the adiabatic approximation to get a finite pumping current under a finite speed modulation .",
    "although there exist some papers discussing non - adiabatic pumping effects based on a stochastic equation with weak noise@xcite , the master equation@xcite , the floquet scattering theory@xcite , and the green function@xcite , it is unclear how non - adiabatic effects affect the pumping current . indeed , it is known that a non - adiabatic process can cause a phase transition through the analysis of a simple quantum mechanical model@xcite .",
    "we may ask another non - trivial question associated with the non - adiabatic pumping process besides the pumping current .",
    "although there exists the heat fluctuation theorem@xcite , for adiabatic dynamics of open markovian processes , at least , the heat fluctuation theorem seems to be violated under some situations such as the dynamics under modulated external fields@xcite , non - gaussian noise@xcite , or dry friction@xcite .",
    "we have to clarify the reason why the heat fluctuation theorem seems to be violated .    in this paper",
    ", we systematically study non - adiabatic pumping effects within the framework of the quantum master equation under the markovian approximation .",
    "for this purpose , similar to ref.@xcite , we analyze the simplest spin - boson model under the weak coupling condition between surrounding environments and the system .",
    "we continuously control the temperatures in the environments with the modulation frequency @xmath3 , and clarify the initial condition dependence of the pumping current and the essential non - adiabatic effects on the pumping current .",
    "we also extend the steady heat fluctuation theorem to cases of slowly modulated temperatures and high transferred energy limits .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sect .  2 , we introduce the model of the spin - boson system and the methods of the generalized quantum master equation with the full counting statistics ( fcs ) .",

    "3.2 , we apply our formulation to the spin - boson system introduced in sec .  2 , and present the results for the pumping current to clarify the non - adiabatic effects . in sect .  3.3",

    ", we summarize the relationship between our formulation and that in ref.@xcite . in appendix e",

    "<S> we clarify the role of non - adiabatic effects in quantum pumping for a spin - boson system . </S>",
    "<S> when we sinusoidally control the temperatures of two reservoirs with @xmath0 phase difference , we find that the pumping current strongly depends on the initial condition , and thus , the current deviates from that predicted by the adiabatic treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we also analytically obtain the contribution of non - adiabatic effects in the pumping current proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the angular frequency of the temperature control . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the analytic expression is verified by our numerical calculation . moreover , we extend the steady heat fluctuation theorem to the case for slowly modulated temperatures and large transferred energies . </S>"
