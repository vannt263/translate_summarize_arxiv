    "the identification of a new thermodynamic surface phase is always of fundamental significance .",
    "vicinal surfaces of metals , consisting of a regular array of low - index terraces separated by parallel steps , are of special interest because of their ubiquity , due to _ e.g. _ small miscut angles , and because of the expected rich interplay between steps and kinks .",
    "a vicinal surface typically has only two states : flat and rough , with a phase transition from flat to rough at a much lower temperature than that of a low - index face .",
    "the transition is generated by the proliferation of kinks in the steps , as first discussed by villain _",
    "et al._@xcite at roughening , steps develop kinks and start to meander freely , giving rise to divergent fluctuations in the position of the surface along the normal . at these relatively low temperatures , very neat stm observations of roughening",
    "are possible , as recently demonstrated for ag(115 ) by hoogeman _",
    "et al._@xcite    a more complex and interesting roughening behaviour could be anticipated if interactions between the kinks were important .",
    "elasticity theory predicts a repulsive interaction between two kinks in the same direction along a step ( parallel kinks ) which asymptotically should decay as @xmath0.@xcite if this repulsion were strong enough , a new vicinal disordered flat ( vdof ) phase , with long - range antiparallel order of kinks within a step , could perhaps be stabilized , in analogy with the stabilization on a low - index surface of a standard dof phase@xcite by elastic parallel step - step repulsion.@xcite similarly , the effect of parallel kink - kink repulsion should be to shift vicinal roughening to a higher temperature , and this may uncover a vicinal preroughening ( vpr ) transition which , involving proliferation of correlated left - right kinks , remains unaffected .",
    "we have identified a simplified model of a vicinal surface where precisely this scenario is realized .",
    "while we believe that our findings have a broader significance , we have specialized our modeling to mimick the situation of ag(115 ) , where we speculate vpr might take place .",
    "so long as temperature is far below melting , a good description of vicinal surface roughening is given by the terrace - step - kink ( tsk ) model.@xcite it ignores the possibility of adatoms on terraces , so that the step positions are the only statistical variables in the problem .",
    "if a solid - on - solid condition is assumed all over the step length , then the position of a step with respect to @xmath1 can be encoded by a variable @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the step label and @xmath4 is an abscissa along the step ) .",
    "the tsk model further assumes a repulsive interaction between neighbouring steps and an energy cost for forming kinks on primary steps . in the celebrated model by villain , grempel , and lapujoulade ( vgl),@xcite @xmath2 is an integer variable and only unitary kinks are permitted ( the energy cost for each being @xmath5 ) .",
    "moreover , an energy @xmath6 is to be paid when @xmath7 , nothing for @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is not allowed .",
    "the vgl model is exactly solvable in the highly anisotropic , @xmath10 limit.@xcite in particular , a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition is predicted to occur at a temperature @xmath11 given by @xmath12 .",
    "this transition describes surface roughening since the correlation function @xmath13 is finite as @xmath3 goes to infinity when @xmath14 , while it diverges logarithmically when @xmath15 .",
    "we have modified the vgl hamiltonian to include interactions between the kinks .",
    "these interactions generally arise from the mutual interference between the elastic strain fields determined by the individual kinks . in particular , we allow for a short - range repulsion ( @xmath16 ) between parallel kinks in the same step , and also between parallel kinks in neighbouring steps ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "moreover , the two - sublattice structure of fcc(115 ) is also kept into account ( see fig.1 ) .    with these ingredients ,",
    "we have applied standard metropolis monte carlo or alternatively , mapping onto a 1d quantum spin chain to study the phase diagram as a function of temperature .",
    "the monte carlo lattices employed comprise an increasing number of steps , up to @xmath18 , while the number @xmath19 of step sites along the hard @xmath4 direction is taken 60 times larger .",
    "we monitor usual quantities like kink - kink correlations , heat capacity , vdof order parameter @xmath20 , and the average square lateral excursion of a step @xmath21 .",
    "strong antiparallel vdof correlations between consecutive kinks in a step will result into a vanishing @xmath22 in the thermodynamic limit , with a finite @xmath23 infinite - size extrapolation . in the ordered flat phase , conversely",
    ", @xmath22 is finite , whereas in the disordered rough phase , @xmath23 extrapolates to infinity .",
    "first , we prove the existence of a vdof phase in the phase diagram of our model vicinal by monte carlo . to this end , we observe that the most favourable situation for the vdof is when @xmath17 and @xmath16 are both infinite . we take @xmath24 and vary @xmath25 from 0 to 0.18 .",
    "we find that the rough phase is altogether absent in this case and the high - temperature phase of the model is vdof . in fig.2 , a small part of the vicinal surface",
    "is shown at infinite temperature .",
    "a glance at this picture reveals the general structure of the vdof phase in our model : kinks are very numerous along the steps but the correlation between two consecutive kinks is strictly antiparallel , so that the overall surface is flat and its slope well - defined .",
    "the vdof state in fig.2 is nearly ideal : each step strictly meanders between two positions with equal probability , whence @xmath26 . on decreasing temperature",
    ", @xmath23 shows a peak , centered at @xmath27 , which is size - dependent and allows to locate vpr@xcite ( @xmath28 for @xmath29 , when @xmath30 ; a @xmath31 fit of the data for @xmath32 and 24 yields @xmath33 ) . at the vpr temperature",
    ", @xmath23 grows logarithmically as a function of the surface size and the vicinal is thus rough at an isolated temperature point , while being flat both below and above .",
    "we conclude that if the short - range repulsion between parallel kinks is strong enough , then generally three different surface phases will be thermodinamically stable , i.e. , a low - temperature ordered flat phase , an intermediate vdof phase , and a rough phase at sufficiently high @xmath34 . a weaker repulsion between the kinks ,",
    "on the other hand , may not be sufficient to stabilize the vdof phase , and in that case the standard flat - rough transition is recovered , as in the straight vgl model .",
    "next , we consider the phase diagram for @xmath35 , but with an additional interaction similar to @xmath36 assumed between _ second_-neighbour steps too .",
    "precisely , we assume an energy cost @xmath37 whenever two second neighbouring steps get to the minimal distance @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the atomic diameter .",
    "this discourages meandering of the steps without affecting their kink - antikink zigzagging between two positions only . by mapping onto a 1d quantum model,@xcite",
    "we confirm that a vdof phase can be generated by this second - neighbour step repulsion . while the precise value @xmath37 assumed is of course unrealistic since the repulsive force between two distant steps decay as @xmath40 with distance,@xcite this represents an interesting alternative mechanism to parallel kink repulsion to generate a vdof phase .",
    "having satisfied ourselves that vpr transitions and vdof phases exist in a suitable vicinal model , it becomes of course of interest to ask whether they might actually be realized in a real system .",
    "_ have carried out the first really extensive stm study of a vicinal surface , chosen to be ag(115).@xcite their analysis indicates that , in the temperature range 400 - 500 k , the correlation function @xmath41 of this surface is well represented by a law of the type @xmath42 , which people use for standard surface roughening .",
    "strikingly , however , @xmath43 extrapolates to zero at about 440 k , while @xmath44 crosses the universal roughening value @xmath45 only at the much higher temperature of 490 k. in regular roughening , these two temperatures ought to coincide .",
    "it is tempting to hypothesize that the divergence of @xmath46 could now indicate vpr at 440 k , so that a vdof phase would be realized on ag(115 ) in the temperature window 440 - 490 k.    what could be a realistic set of parameters to represent ag(115 ) ? within the framework of the tsk model with interacting kinks ,",
    "the problem of fitting the parameters to a realistic vicinal is of no simple solution . for ag(115 ) , hoogeman _",
    "have shown that the kink formation energy and the step repulsion can be extracted from stm data , thus providing values for @xmath47 and @xmath36.@xcite moreover , even without a systematic study of kink - kink interactions , a value of 260 k was reported for the repulsion between kinks in neighbouring steps , which we take as the value of @xmath17 . finally , we have no information on @xmath16 , but we believe it should be smaller than @xmath17 , and thus tentatively set it to zero .    in fig.3 , we show simulation data for three sizes , @xmath48 and 24 .",
    "even though the statistics is insufficient , both these data and the behavior of the @xmath49 values during the run are suggestive of a vpr transition at about 380 k , while roughening would not occur before 390 k. alternatively , the vdof state which is occasionally observed during the simulation is in fact only metastable , and a single roughening transition actually occurs at about 375 k , as suggested by the thermal behaviour of @xmath41 . summing up at this stage , we find that with this first choice of parameters there are hints of vpr and of a narrow dof region .",
    "however , the evidence is quantitatively inconclusive .",
    "further work is now in progress , using a different set of parameters . in particular",
    ", it is expected that the effect of a positive @xmath16 should be to shift roughening ( and to a smaller extent also preroughening ) further up in temperature , which goes qualitatively in the right direction .",
    "a more detailed account of ongoing calculations will be presented elsewhere.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced a terrace - step - kink model which generalizes the villain - grempel - lapujoulade description of vicinal surface roughening by including a short - range repulsion between parallel kinks on neighbouring steps as well as on the same step . if the strength of this repulsion is sufficient , a vdof , vicinal disordered phase , could be stabilized in a temperature window between the ordered flat and the disordered rough vicinal phases .",
    "recent stm data are speculatively interpreted to suggest that a possible realization of this new scenario could be found in ag(115 ) between 440 k and 490 k. a refinement of the stm data analysis , particularly concerning the short - distance correlations between kinks , is very desirable , as it could now confirm or deny this conjecture .",
