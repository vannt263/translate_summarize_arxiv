    "the phase space trajectory of a many - body system with convex particles is lyapunov unstable @xcite , which means that it is extremely sensitive to small ( infinitesimal ) perturbations of the initial conditions .",
    "if all possible perturbation vectors are represented as an infinitesimal hypersphere centered on and co - moving with a phase point , at later times this object is deformed under the action of the linearized flow .",
    "the main axes exponentially grow or shrink with time .",
    "the time - averaged rates are referred to as lyapunov exponents , and the sorted set of exponents , @xmath2 , as lyapunov spectrum . here , @xmath3 is the phase - space dimension .",
    "the relation of the lyapunov spectrum to more familiar fluid properties has motivated much work over the last two decades .",
    "if , for example , the density of a soft - potential weeks - chandler - anderson fluid @xcite is isothermally increased from the fluid to the solid phase , the kolmogorov - sinai ( dynamical ) entropy , which is equal to the sum of all positive lyapunov exponents @xcite , exhibits a maximum at a density which is about 20 % smaller than the liquid - line density at the fluid - to - solid phase transition .",
    "this result , which has been verified for two- @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite systems , is somewhat surprising .",
    "it implies that in soft - potential systems most efficient phase space mixing and information generation about the initial state does _ not _ occur at the transition itself but at a slightly smaller density .",
    "this sheds new light on our understanding of the onset of phase transitions .",
    "another example concerns stationary non - equilibrium systems with time - reversible equations of motion . in this case",
    ", the lyapunov spectrum may be directly linked with the transport coefficients and the rate of entropy production @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of simple atomic fluids , such as hard - sphere and soft - sphere models , have revealed some interesting features .",
    "in particular , trajectory perturbations related to the largest ( in absolute value ) lyapunov exponents are strongly localized in physical space @xcite .",
    "this means that at any instant of time only a very small fraction of all particles contributes to the fastest dynamical events responsible for the largest rates of perturbation growth ( or decay ) .",
    "this localization also persists in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a similar localization property for the maximum - exponent perturbations was found for one - dimensional distributed systems with space - time chaos @xcite . on the other hand , perturbation vectors associated with the smallest ( in absolute value ) exponents may be delocalized and exhibit wave - like patterns in space .",
    "these so - called lyapunov modes were first observed for systems of hard dumbbells @xcite and hard disks @xcite and are a consequence of the basic symmetries , namely invariance with respect to time and space translations ( depending on the boundary conditions ) . due to exponent degeneracies ,",
    "they are recognized by a step - like appearance of the lyapunov spectrum for small ( in absolute value ) exponents . for soft - potential systems , however , sophisticated fourier transform techniques are required to demonstrate the presence of lyapunov modes @xcite .",
    "the study of lyapunov exponents has also been extended to simple molecular systems such as soft @xcite and hard dumbbells @xcite in two dimensions . in this case",
    "the dynamics is affected by qualitatively different degrees of freedom , translation and rotation , which both have a pronounced effect on the spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we turn to a related model , which also incorporates the idea of the coupling of translational degrees of freedom to some internal energy , which affects the dynamics , namely rough hard disks in two dimensions . the three - dimensional version of this model , rough hard spheres , was first introduced by bryan @xcite in 1894 , and was consecutively treated by pidduck @xcite and , in particular , by chapman and cowling @xcite , who worked out explicit formulas for the transport coefficients in terms of kinetic theory .",
    "it is an extension of the familiar smooth hard - sphere model , with angular momentum added to each sphere due to roughness .",
    "roughness is introduced by the requirement that a collision between two particles reverses the relative surface velocity at the point of contact of the collision partners , exchanging both linear and angular momentum in the process .",
    "this definition corresponds to the maximum possible roughness between two particles .",
    "this model was extensively studied by berne and co - workers with respect to various models of molecular rotational relaxation @xcite .",
    "they also investigated the dynamical properties of models with partial roughness in between that of the smooth and the maximum rough sphere models @xcite , in particular the hydrodynamic long - time behavior of various correlation functions @xcite .",
    "here we are concerned with the two - dimensional version of this model with maximum roughness , @xmath4 identical rough hard disk in a box with periodic boundaries .",

    "it should be noted that for the definition of @xmath132 the euclidean norm is used and that all localication measures depend on this choice .",

    "this localization spectrum changes surprisingly little when @xmath50 is increased from zero to one .",
    "the only major difference is for the rotation - dominated regime . for the smooth disks , @xmath51 , the points for @xmath142 are irrelevant in this regime , @xmath144 , and",

    "this measure might be particularly useful , whenever localization is even more complete than in the case presented here , but it distinguishes poorly between very delocalized states ..    at this point , a critical remark is in order .",

    "however , for @xmath103 the spectra are slightly asymmetric ( not shown ) .",

    "all spectra eventually converge .",
    "any two tangent vectors giving rise to the _ same _ lyapunov exponent but belonging to _ different _ initial sets @xmath158 need to become parallel or anti - parallel in the course of time , such that their dot - product approaches @xmath159 . to measure the convergence time for a given @xmath72",
