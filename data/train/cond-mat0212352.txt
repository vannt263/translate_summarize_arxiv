    "quasicrystals are solids with quasiperiodic translational order and rotational symmetry that is disallowed for periodic crystals , such as ten - fold symmetry in the plane or icosahedral symmetry in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on decagonal quasicrystals that are quasiperiodic in the @xmath0-plane and periodic along the @xmath1 direction  @xcite .",
    "the atomic structure has conventionally been described as a periodic stacking of quasiperiodically ordered layers each of which can be interpreted as a penrose tiling formed from two tile shapes .",
    "the two tiles correspond to two different atomic clusters which join to form the layer .",
    "we have proposed an alternative picture in which the quasicrystal structure is described in terms of a single repeating unit called a `` quasi - unit cell  @xcite '' . for ten - fold symmetric layers ,",
    "the quasi - unit cell is typically chosen to be a decagon , corresponding to a decagonal atomic cluster . the tiling picture and the quasi - unit cell picture",
    "are mathematically equivalent , but the latter has numerous advantages .",
    "first , the quasi - unit cell picture encodes the entire structure , both the symmetry and the detailed atomic decoration , within the single decagonal cluster  @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the problem of finding the atomic structure based on empirical data .",
    "secondly , the quasi - unit cell suggests simple energetics that may explain why quasicrystals form  @xcite .",
    "a key difference between quasi - unit cells and tiles is that the quasi - unit cells overlap .",
    "the overlap corresponds physically to the sharing of atoms by neighboring decagonal clusters , a feature which is observed in real quasicrystals  @xcite .",
    "the overlaps are restricted to certain relative positions and orientations of the quasi - unit cells according to  overlap rules . \"",
    "the overlap rules replace the penrose rules for joining tiles . in real quasicrystals ,",
    "these overlap rules are automatically enforced by the atomic decoration which only permits sharing corresponding to the allowed overlaps . for the decagonal case",
    ", this means that the decoration breaks 10-fold symmetry .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the precise relationship between atomic decorations in the quasi - unit cell and the rhombus penrose tiling pictures , which is rather subtle , and to present a method for computing the density and stoichiometry of a quasicrystal given the atomic decoration of the quasi - unit cell .",
    "the latter is a simple but powerful tool for comparing data to proposed atomic structural models . for periodic crystals ,",
    "the analogous calculation is trivial since the density and stoichiometry are the same as that of the unit cell because the unit cells join face - to - face .",
    "the technical complication for quasicrystals is finding a method that properly accounts for the overlap and avoids double - counting or under - counting .",

    "figure  [ f_overlap_rule ] shows the overlap rule introduced by p. gummelt which forces a perfect quasicrystalline structure with a single , repeating , decagonal quasi - unit - cell , the marked decagon shown in  ( a ) .",

    "this permits five types of pairwise overlaps , four types of @xmath2-overlaps and one type of @xmath3-overlap as shown in ( b ) .",
    "the two types of overlaps correspond to two separations between clusters whose ratio is the golden ratio .",
    "an infinite arrangement of decagons according to the above rule is called the decagonal `` covering , '' to distinguish it from a `` tiling '' in which the units join edge - to - edge without overlap .",
    "the covering can be mapped into a conventional edge - to - edge tiling in at least three ways :    convert the covering to a rhombus penrose tiling by dividing up central area of each decagon into a jack ( known in the penrose tiling literature to mean 5 fat and 2 skinny rhombi surrounding a jack vertex ) .",
    "this construction leaves three skinny rhombus - shaped regions inside the decagon .",

    "however , the relationship between the atomic models constructed by the quasi - unit - cell decorations and those obtained by penrose tile decorations is a different issue and has not been carefully investigated previously .",
    "we will call the former atomic models as decagonal quasi - unit - cell models and compare them with the latter penrose - tile models . for penrose - tile models",
    ", we will consider rhombus penrose - tile decorations .",
    "we define a penrose atomic model to correspond to decorating each fat rhombus identically , each skinny rhombus identically , and then joining them to form a penrose tiling .",
    "a quasi - unit - cell model corresponds to decorating a fundamental decagon and then covering the plane with the identical decorated decagon according to the overlap rule .",
    "the decoration must satisfy the condition that , where two atoms overlap , they are the same atom type .",
    "the rule is that this represents a single atom shared by the two decagon clusters .",
    "( there can be more than two overlaps , too , in which case one atom is assigned to be shared by 3 decagons . ) if an atom in one decagon overlaps an unoccupied site in a neighbor site , the atom is still assigned to the spot and shared . for any given site ,",
    "the associated `` image '' sites are positions in the fundamental decagon which can overlay that site when decagons are joined according to the gummelt overlap rules .",
    "the number of image sites varies , depending on where the original site is in the fundamental decagon .",
    "one might suppose that atomic decorations of the quasi - unit - cell models form a subset of the penrose - tile models due to there being a single unit and its being subject to overlap decoration constraints .",
    "on the contrary , as we will show next , the set of atomic decorations of the decagonal quasi - unit - cell models is greater than the set of atomic decorations of a penrose tiling model with the same edge length .",
    "* lemma i * : every rhombus penrose - tile model is equivalent to a decagonal quasi - unit - cell model with the same edge length .    proof : a fundamental decagon can be subdivided into a jack configuration of fat and skinny rhombi plus 3 skinny - shaped rhombus areas surrounding .",
    "decorate each fat and skinny rhombus in the jack according to the penrose decoration .",
    "place no atoms in the 3 skinny - shaped rhombus areas surrounding .",

    "( the skinny outlying regions are always overlapped by jack regions of neighboring decagon and thereby resolve into a skinny rhombus or parts of a pair of fat rhombi . )",
    "hence , the decagon decoration of the fundamental decagon obtained by this construction produces the same result as the penrose decoration obtained by joining identically decorated fat and skinny penrose tiles .",
    "* lemma ii * : some decagonal quasi - unit - cell models are not equivalent to rhombus penrose - tile model with the same edge length .    proof : this lemma asserts that the converse of lemma i is not true .",

    "[ f_atom_deco](a ) .",
    "when the decagon is resolved into a jack , one fat rhombus has an atom whereas the other four do not .",
    "when the decagons are joined to form an overlap tiling , many obtuse rhombi remain unoccupied despite the overlap ( see the upper part of fig .  [ f_atom_deco](a ) ) .",
    "hence , the decagon decoration is not equivalent to a penrose - tile decoration based on these fat and skinny rhombi with the same edge length .",
    "we have shown that the atomic decorations of decagons is strictly greater than the set of atomic decorations of penrose tiles of _ identical _ edge length . however , the relationship between the two is more subtle than one might suppose .",
    "let us next compare the atomic decorations of the decagons to decorations of _ inflated _ penrose tiles whose edge length is greater than that of the decagons .",
    "for example , the quasi - unit - cell model of fig .",
    "[ f_atom_deco](a ) is not a penrose - tile model with the same edge size but it is a penrose - tile model with the ( single ) inflated rhombi as shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ f_atom_deco](a ) . each inflated fat rhombus is decorated identically and so is each inflated skinny rhombus .",
    "is this true for a general atomic decoration of the quasi - unit - cell model ?",
    "the answer is no , as can be seen from the example of fig .",
    "[ f_atom_deco](b ) .",
    "the inflated fat rhombi at the right upper corner are decorated with zero , one or two atoms depending on the context .",
    "neither doubly ( at the middle of the panel ) nor triply ( at the bottom of the panel ) inflated penrose rhombi are decorated identically .",
    "for example , some triply inflated fat tiles have six atoms while some others have five .",
    "therefore , the quasi - unit cell decoration is not generally equivalent to a penrose tiling even when one considers penrose tiling edge lengths which are @xmath4 times that of the decagon .",
    "however , an equivalence does emerge if one considers a penrose - tile model with fourfold inflated penrose tiles as shown in fig  [ f_atom_deco](c ) .",
    "this result is surprising at first and hard to imagine since the fourfold inflated rhombus tiles , whose edge is @xmath5 times longer than the edge of the quasi - unit decagon , have scores of original decorated decagons .",
    "there are nine different types of decorations of the original ( uninflated ) decagons in general due to the nine different configurations of overlapping decagons in its neighbor  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ f_4th_inflated](a ) . in spite of this large number of different decorations , the decagons at the equivalent positions in all fourfold inflated rhombus tiles turn out to be the same type .",
    "therefore , the fourfold inflated tiles of the same shapes are decorated identically .",
    "the rigorous proof for this and the inflation rules for the decorated decagons will be published elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the right - lower panel of fig .",
    "[ f_4th_inflated](b ) illustrates our claim in a finite part of decagon covering .",
    "we put the overlap - type of each decagon in a decagon covering and overlay them with the inflated fat tile .",
    "we see that the decagon arrangement of all inflated tiles of the same shapes are identical but their types are not identical for doubly and triply inflated tiles .",
    "however , for the quadratically inflated fat tiles , we see that the types of decagons are also identical as shown in the right - lower panel .",
    "this relationship gives a precise quantification of the degree to which the quasi - unit cell picture simplifies the problem of defining ( and finding ) atomic structures of quasicrystals .",
    "that is , the quasi - unit cell description and the penrose tiling description ( allowing for fourfold inflation ) are equivalent mathematically , but the quasi - unit cell has an area which is @xmath6 times smaller and , hence , defines the structure using @xmath7 times fewer atoms on average .",

    "note that the number density of @xmath8-type atoms in any finite region is , in general , different from @xmath9 due to the quasiperiodicity of the quasicrystalline lattice .",

    "the only complication for tilings is for atoms at the boundaries where the conventional approach works .",
    "namely , if each boundary atom is treated as a disk with small finite radius , the atoms at the boundaries are assigned a fractional weight according to the fraction of the disk that lies within the tile .    in the previous section ,",

    "the decagon in a gummelt covering has 10 different possible directions and the perp - space image of the jack vertices in the decagons with the same direction is the triangle shown in fig  [ f_deco_jack](b ) . ) the perp - space images of all atoms in the model is then given by the union of ten triangles of ten different directions .",
    "figure  [ f_deco_jack](a ) shows such simple decoration of fundamental decagon which is equivalent to a penrose lattice decoration where atoms decorate each jack vertex .",

    "from the fact that the reflection transforms the base vectors in the perp - space equivalently to the transform of base vectors in the real space , we can say that the perp - space image has the mirror symmetry if the decoration of fundamental decagon has the mirror symmetry . however , the converse is not true .",
