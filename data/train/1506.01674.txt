    "all the physical properties of a thermomagnetic material used in the main text ( the resistivity @xmath27 , the nernst coefficient @xmath26 , the thermal conductivity @xmath28 ) are intended defined in a transversely isothermal setup ( e.g. the isothermal resistivity is measured keeping the transverse temperature gradient to zero ) .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath23 is thus called the _",

    "it is also useful to define the _",

    "the latter is measured keeping the transverse heat flow to zero and reads@xcite @xmath137 .",
    "the two figures of merit are related by @xmath25 , so that @xmath129 is always larger than zt and their range of physical values is different in that @xmath138 while @xmath139.@xcite    measured zt for bi and bisb alloys reaches , in high magnetic fields , values between 0.2 and 0.4 in the temperature range 100 - 300k , as shown in the inset of fig . 3 in the main text@xcite .",
    "correspondingly @xmath129 assumes values between 0.25 and 0.66 .    the adiabatic figure of merit @xmath24 plays in thermomagnetic applications the role that the isothermal thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath140 ( where s is the seebeck coefficient ) plays in thermoelectric ( seebeck - peltier ) applications@xcite .",
    "the fundamental equations for the heat flow and temperature distribution for a circular ettingshausen cooler , as we have seen in the main text are : [ eq : jz ] j_z&=#&+ , + [ eq : qr ] q_r&=#&e_z+k(zt-1 ) , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the electric current density and the electric field respectively ( @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the electrochemical potential ) , along the direction of the cable , whereas @xmath49 is the heat current density in the radial direction and @xmath50 is the absolute temperature .",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and thus @xmath29 are in general functions of temperature and magnetic field , and indeed material - dependent .",
    "all quantities are constants in @xmath43 and @xmath44 because of the cylindrical symmetry but are indeed functions of @xmath51 .",
    "however the continuity of the elettrochemical potential and the symmetry - imposed constant value of @xmath52 as a function of z implies that @xmath53 is a constant in r , because@xcite @xmath141 this implies in particular , through eq .",
    "( [ eq : jz ] ) , that the current density @xmath45 likely varies with r.    @xmath55 is the intensity of the magnetic field ( oriented along @xmath56 ) , which we parametrize by its value at the interface between the conducting core and the thermomagnetic coating @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vacuum permittivity and @xmath10 and @xmath59 are the total current and current density in the cable core , respectively ( in principle one should also consider the magnetic permittivity of the thermomagnetic material @xmath142 in the calculation of b. however even in strong diamagnetic materials ( such as bi ) @xmath142 is in practice 1 ) .",
    "the current density i is that of the main current transported by the cable , running in the cable core and generating the magnetic field , and should not be confused with the density of auxiliary current @xmath45 , which runs in the thermomagnetic coating and is responsible for the ettingshausen cooling effect .",
    "typically @xmath59 will be several orders of magnitude larger than @xmath45 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : jz ] ) and ( [ eq : qr ] ) only express the heat and charge current response of a material submitted to a temperature and electrochemical potential gradient at a given point , but in order to find the temperature and current distribution energy conservation has to be enforced at each point by a continuity equation@xcite @xmath62 , that here specializes to : [ eq : continuity ] = e_zj_z    we will now solve the case with constant @xmath27 , @xmath26 and @xmath28 ( and thus @xmath29 ) . indeed equations ( [ eq : jz ] ) and ( [ eq : continuity ] ) can be combined and , in the case of constant @xmath27 and @xmath26 , solved for @xmath63 giving : [ eq : sol_qr ] q_r(r)= e_z+ r+ with @xmath143 a constant in r. also , from ( [ eq : qr ] ) and ( [ eq : sol_qr ] ) one obtains the equation for the temperature distribution @xmath50 : [ eq : t_r ] k(zt-1)=r+ .",
    "a difficulty here is that z depends on r through the magnetic field @xmath144 . in order to proceed analytically",
    "we make , in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_r ] ) , the approximation @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is a constant in r. this may be not too bad of an approximation , since in our setup z(r ) diminishes with r and t(r ) grows .",
    "moreover in realistic situations - and this even prescinds from specific geometrical considerations - , at large values of the magnetic field zt is known to saturate , becoming constant in b , while an optimal choice of the thermomagnetic material in the range of temperatures of interest implies that zt should be near to its maximum and thus likely quite constant for a range of temperatures . as a practical example - as shown in the main article ( inset of fig .",
    "3 ) - for fields above 5 t and temperatures between 100k and 300k bismuth has a rather constant value of zt between 0.2 and 0.4@xcite .",
    "however it does so thanks to a compensation of the dependence of @xmath20 , @xmath19 and @xmath21 , which is not taken into account here since we have assumed these quantities to be constants , thus our treatment remains approximate in any case .      two kind of boundary conditions",
    "can be used to parametrize the solutions through @xmath147 and @xmath143 .",
    "indeed the external ( heat sink ) temperature is fixed for a thermostated device , i.e. @xmath64 , and either the internal temperature @xmath148 or the heat flow at the source @xmath65 can be fixed ( in each case the other quantity becoming a function of the fixed one ) .",
    "it is the latter that is useful in the context of this article . when fixing the boundary conditions so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 one obtains the two conditions [ eq : boundary_q_in ] c_0&=&q_inr_0-r_0 ^ 2-e_zr_0 + c_1&=&k(-1)t_h - r^2-c_0 ( in these implicit expressions @xmath149 through eq .",

    "the electric field that minimizes @xmath70 at fixed @xmath68 - which is given by the same condition that maximizes the cooling power @xmath152 for any fixed @xmath70 - is : [ eq : emax_supp ] e_z^max= , where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 measures the thickness of the thermomagnetic layer ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "this formula is very similar to the case of a rectangular cooler@xcite ( where @xmath153 , and @xmath75 is the thickness of the cooler ) .",
    "@xmath76 is a geometrical factor accounting for the present cylindrical setup : @xmath77 and thus @xmath78 diverges for @xmath79 reaching unity ( as it happens in the rectangular cooler for vanishing thickness b ) .",
    "the expression eq.([eq : emax_supp ] ) is exact in our model ,",
    "i.e. it does not depend on the approximation @xmath154 , because the terms involving @xmath146 disappear when performing the derivative in @xmath53 ( even without doing the aforementioned approximation this holds true because the derivative of the terms in question vanish at the extremal point ) .",
    "the maximum temperature difference then reads : [ eq : dtmax_qin ] t_max = t_l^2-q_in where @xmath81 is the isothermal figure of merit corresponding to @xmath82 , the magnetic field in @xmath42 ( and is independent of temperature in the chosen model ) .    in the case of a single - staged cooler of a superconducting cable @xmath69 , and",
    "taking into account that @xmath155 ( see below ) , the adiabatic figure of merit in @xmath42 , the formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtmax_qin ] ) then reduces to the result : [ eq : dtmax_supp ] t_max = z_a^0t_l^2    in this compact formula , useful for direct comparison with the analogous one for rectangular coolers",
    "( 1 ) of the main article , we have however used here @xmath156 in a quite sloppy way . indeed even in this simplified model , rigorously the adiabatic figure of merit reads @xmath157 and thus it is a function of temperature .",
    "then , depending on the precise choice of @xmath146 in our approximated treatment , @xmath158 can coincide with @xmath159 ( if one takes @xmath160 , with @xmath161 any reasonable temperature , e.g. @xmath70 ) or can assume other values .",
    "indeed the precise choice of @xmath146 for any given @xmath79 in the analytical model is somewhat arbitrary in the present treatment , however most reasonable choices yield an analytic @xmath70 fitting the numerical data ( at least for the physical parameters chosen here ) within a few % over a range @xmath79=1@xmath1043.5 .",
    "this is shown by the comparison of two such choices in fig .",
    "[ fig : cable_fixpar_supp ] ( solid lines ) , and their nice agreement with the exact numerical solution of the model ( dots ) .",
    "this justifies the use of a `` generic '' @xmath156 that we have made in the main article , however one should keep in mind this point .",
    "examples of possible choices are the natural mean - field - like choice @xmath162 and the choice @xmath163 , leading to @xmath164 . in the latter case , solving explicitly for @xmath70 gives : t_l= the blue solid line ( titled @xmath165 ) plotted in fig.[fig : cable_fixpar_supp ] is @xmath96 calculated using this expression and shows a good agreement with the numerical solution .",
    "the choice @xmath166 ( where @xmath167 is the middle temperature in the cooler ) is instead further off at large @xmath79 but reproduces exactly the @xmath168 limit , conciding with the result for a rectangular cooler ( eq.(1 ) of the main article , black solid horizontal line in the figure ) .",
    "much more precise results reproducing the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath79 ( particularly for large @xmath79 ) are obtained setting ( in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dtmax_qin ] ) for @xmath69 ) the fraction @xmath169 i.e. to a constant in @xmath79 in which the value of @xmath70 is replaced with that obtained for vanishing thickness .",

    "when the cylindrical cooler has a finite thickness , however , the value of @xmath35 is reduced by the geometrical factor @xmath94 , which is a slowly decaying function of @xmath79 .",
    "this reduction shows that the decay of magnetic field with the distance from the core cable prevails on the advantages of the cylindrical shape ( as illustrated numerically in the main article , fig.2 , where it is shown that for a constant magnetic field @xmath95 , @xmath35 grows with @xmath79 ) .    in the main article , for the case in which @xmath69 , we have also considered , as a measure of the convenience of the cooling process , the expenditure of electric power ( per unit cable length ) for the cooling , @xmath98 .",

    "<S> magnitude of the effect *    one may rightfully wonder if such an effect can be large enough for practical use . </S>",
    "<S> indeed one can consider two possible applications of extreme technological interest , among others , like cooling a cable with a high-@xmath12 superconductor core for it to function in an environment at ambient temperature , or for a cable of conventional superconductor to function at liquid nitrogen temperature . </S>",
    "<S> for these situations very large temperature drops induced by the cooling mechanism are needed , with t@xmath13 t@xmath14 ( where t@xmath15 and t@xmath16 are the temperatures of the cold side and of the hot side of the cooling coating , respectively , such that @xmath17 the temperature drop due to the ettingshausen cooler ) . </S>",

    "<S> this is obtained by minimizing @xmath70 at fixed @xmath68 and is : [ eq : emax ] e_z^max= , where @xmath71 , and @xmath72 measures the thickness of the thermomagnetic layer ( @xmath73 ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath76 is an adimensional geometrical factor accounting for the present cylindrical setup : @xmath77 and thus @xmath78 diverges for @xmath79 reaching unity ( as it happens in the rectangular cooler for vanishing thickness b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is to be noted that this value is independent of @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> the maximum temperature difference is instead reduced by any finite @xmath68 ( see supplementary material ) but in the case of a single - staged cooler of a superconducting cable where @xmath69 it reaches its maximal value and reads : [ eq : dtmax ] t_max = z_a^0t_l^2 where @xmath80 is the adiabatic figure of merit corresponding to @xmath81 , the isothermal figure of merit at @xmath82 , the magnetic field in @xmath42 ( @xmath83 is independent of temperature in the chosen model ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we are then in the position to assess the order of magnitude of the temperature drop that can be obtained by the present cooling system . indeed fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cable_fixpar ] shows that the analytical model captures very well the result of the numerical solution ( lines vs squares ) , and from formula ( [ eq : dtmax ] ) one sees that for a circular cooler of vanishing thickness , since @xmath84 , the maximum temperature drop is equivalent to that for a rectangular cooler ( in a constant magnetic field @xmath82 ) eq . </S>",

    "<S> this reduction shows that the decay of magnetic field with the distance from the core cable prevails on the aforementioned advantages of the cylindrical shape . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is remarkable that if a constant @xmath95 is fictitiously imposed , then the @xmath96 ( calculated numerically ) is on the contrary enhanced for thicker circular coolers ( fig . [ </S>",

    "<S> this illustrates explicitly the improvement of cooling power over a rectangular shape ( for which @xmath96 is independent of the thickness , eq.([eq : slab_dtmax ] ) ) brought in by the circular geometry . </S>",
    "<S> a constant magnetic field is indeed artificial in this geometry but , as we will see later on , this advantage can still be exploited in a real cooler whenever the figure of merit of the thermomagnetic material becomes insensitive to the decay of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> there , the circular geometry yields enhanced performances .    we have not considered thus far the overall efficiency of the proposed cooler . </S>",
    "<S> indeed energy will be dissipated to maintain the temperature gradient and heat will be expelled ( even when @xmath69 ) , in accord with the second principle of thermodynamics . in the case </S>",

    "<S> it should also be noted that @xmath100 depends only on the ratio @xmath72 , but for a larger device ( i.e. larger @xmath42 and r , at constant @xmath79 ) the same heat is distributed on a larger surface ( i.e. @xmath103 is smaller ) so it will be more convenient for the thermalization to the ambient temperature </S>",
    "<S> .    thus in the present model with constant coefficients a compromise in choosing the coating thickness , between the decay of @xmath22 and that of @xmath100 , has to be found , i.e. a regime in which the amount of power needed to reach the desired temperature drop does nt make the whole process largely disadvantageous compared to other cooling systems . in this view , as shown for peltier cooling in ref . , the main practical advantage of a circular over a rectangular setup is the automatic thermal insulation ensured by the circular geometry , and absence of border effects far from the cable ends .    however turning to more realistic calculations </S>",

    "<S> indeed it is known@xcite that when the condition @xmath106 is met , where @xmath107 is the electron mobility , the figure of merit saturates . </S>",
    "<S> this happens obviously at higher fields , for higher temperatures , at which the electron mobility is lower . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that @xmath108 is the saturation field at room temperature ( implying also that at all lower temperatures zt will have already reached its saturated value ) . indeed in our setup , if the whole thermomagnetic layer is immersed in a field above the saturation value at room temperature , then its properties will be insensitive to changes in b , and @xmath22 is expected to grow , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cable_fixpar ] . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is the lowest at the external border ( i.e. @xmath109 ) and it diminishes with growing @xmath79 , so as long as @xmath79 is such that @xmath110 is above 5 t we expect @xmath22 to grow , and only for larger @xmath79 s to start the logarithmic decrease expected in the analytical model . it is easily checked that @xmath111 when @xmath112 , for the chosen @xmath113 , so the rationale matches the simulations .    as a partial conclusion then , numerical simulations for realistic parameters show that the proposed ettingshausen cable cooler realized in pure bismuth may in principle reach more than 60k temperature drop from the ambient temperature if the current running through the core is strong enough to generate a field at the interface of @xmath114 , which is a realistic value for a superconducting cable ( and @xmath22 would grow even more for higher magnetic fields and higher @xmath79 s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this would be done with moderate energy cost , as the expelled heat would be of @xmath3350 - 80 w / cm of cable length , which is a very encouraging result .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the evaluation of the heat loss however , one realizes that higher temperature drops are needed in the hope of using this cooling system down to high - tc superconductor critical temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the usual way to go to do this is using multiple cooling stages@xcite .    * staging *    indeed in this context multiple layers of ( possibly different ) thermomagnetic materials , each with a different electric field ( and thus a different current running through them ) can further improve the performance . adding a second stage yields a temperature drop @xmath115 which is a complicated function of the two electric fields and the two radiuses @xmath116 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular @xmath117 will be reduced due to the heat flux @xmath118 expelled from the inner stage . </S>",
    "<S> an exact theory of staging optimization is beyond the scope of this article , however the generalization of the formula for @xmath22 eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dtmax ] ) to finite @xmath68 ( see supplementary material ) suggests a simple way to nearly double the @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed @xmath117 is reduced by a term @xmath119 , that can thus be minimized by minimizing the thickness of the layer @xmath120 , which also maximizes the term proportional to @xmath80 since the geometrical factor in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dtmax ] ) tends to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus in principle a double coated cable with the external cooler layer much thinner than the internal one , in which both electric fields would be tuned to the respective @xmath101 , would nearly double the @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> this can be successfully simulated and as an example the configuration ( keeping the realistic material properties for bi and the same core current and radius @xmath121 as before ) with r@xmath122=5 cm , r@xmath123=5.1 cm , e@xmath124=0.065v / cm and e@xmath125=0.48v / cm yields @xmath22=105.5k ( see fig.[fig : cable_bi ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this excellent result is however reached at the expenses of a very large energy consumption ( @xmath100=1072w / cm ! ) , since e@xmath125 is very large to match the value for maximum cooling in the very thin second layer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed a compromise between temperature drop and heat losses is part of the optimization process and is beyond the scope of this article . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we judge the present results of @xmath126 very encouraging for future applications .    </S>",
    "<S> * discussion : main obstacles and improvement of materials *    at this point of the discussion , a few obstacles need to be pointed out . </S>",
    "<S> one obvious problem in the case of the cooling of a superconducting cable is the starting procedure . indeed in the steady state the presented setup runs in a `` symbiotic '' configuration : the superconducting current provides the high magnetic field needed to operate the cooler , which in turn provides the low temperature needed for the superconductor to work . </S>",
    "<S> this mode of operation seems reachable only if another , more conventional cooling system is used for initiating the steady state .    </S>",
    "<S> another point to be considered is that for the device to actually work with a superconductor the temperature to be reached is well below @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed t@xmath127 is lowered by a finite magnetic field and current density . </S>",
    "<S> these three parameters are interdependent have to be inside a zone in the parameter space ( see e.g. @xcite for nb@xmath3sn ) such that all are far from their highest values . thus the needed temperature drops </S>",
    "<S> are even larger than just reaching t@xmath127(b=0 , i=0 ) and have to be obtained with magnetic fields well below the critical values , etc .    </S>",
    "<S> a third point is that bismuth , today s champion thermomagnetic material at ambient temperature , has very anisotropic properties . </S>",
    "<S> since it is probably unpractical to coat a cable in a layer of oriented single - crystals of bismuth such that @xmath128 is maximized at all angles , the actual performance is likely to be inferior to what the simulations presented in this article show .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , for applications at temperatures below 100k ( e.g. in a possible setup in which a low - t@xmath127 superconductor is cooled with the thermomagnetic coating in order to operate in an external bath of liquid nitrogen , much less expensive than the normally used liquid helium ) unfortunately bismuth is not useful . indeed its thermomagnetic properties degrade quickly below @xmath33100k . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    all the listed hindering point could be overcome however if better thermomagnetic performance than in bismuth and its alloys@xcite could be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> indeed thermoelectric materials have witnessed enormous developments in the last decades , while thermomagnetic materials have received much less attention . </S>",
    "<S> few exceptions are noteworthy , and encouraging . for instance lately the large value of @xmath129=0.5 in the range 35 - 50k has been reported for li@xmath130mo@xmath131o@xmath132@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the guidelines for the search of efficient thermomagnetic materials have been laid down@xcite : ambipolarity ( i.e. the presence of both electron and hole carriers ) , high - mobilities , low fermi energies ( i.e. shallow bands ) . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are difficult to be optimized altogether , however heavy - fermionic materials ( in which the electronic masses enhanced by the strong electronic correlations favor low fermi energies ) are being explored@xcite and some of them like uru@xmath123si@xmath123 and prfe@xmath133p@xmath134 have shown a large nernst effect at temperatures of a few kelvins , holding promises for ettingshausen cooling in that range of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> other materials show large nernst signals like correlated semiconductor fesb2@xcite , iron pnictides ( see e.g. c. hess in @xcite ) and others , but the optimization of thermomagnetic materials remains essentially uncharted territory as of today . </S>",
    "<S> very rough estimates </S>",
    "<S> let however imagine that nothing prevents reaching zt as high as 0.8,@xcite in principle , which would yield exceptional performances .    </S>",
    "<S> * conclusions *    in conclusion , a solid - state mechanism for building self - cooling high - power cables was proposed in this article . </S>",
    "<S> an analytical treatment of the differential equations for the temperature and heat current distributions was given for the case of constant material parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate for the maximal temperature drop that can be obtained in this setup is similar - actually slightly inferior for finite thickness - to that of a standard rectangular cooler ( in a constant magnetic field equal to the maximum field in the circular cooler b@xmath135 ) , because the advantage in heat pumping brought in by the circular shape is overrun by the decay of the magnetic field with distance . </S>",
    "<S> however remarkably numerical simulations with realistic parameters for bismuth coatings show that for a coating layer up to 2.5 times wider than the core the temperature drop from ambient temperature increases until @xmath060k . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the saturation of the thermomagnetic properties in high magnetic fields , so that as long as the entire coating is immersed in a field larger than 5 t for bismuth the performance is insensitive to the decay of b(r ) and only the advantage due to the geometrical properties of the circular setup remain . </S>",
    "<S> finally results from simulations for a 2-layer staged cooler are given , showing temperature drops larger than 100k ( even if with a much larger electrical expenditure ) from the ambient , as indeed predicted by the analytical model .    </S>",
    "<S> these results are encouraging for applications such as high - power cables for long - distance transport of electric power , but also with some adjustments to the cooling of magnet coils , among others . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement on the present - day performance of the known thermomagnetic materials is probably needed for any of these applications to become technologically convenient , and hopefully this article will stimulate further research in this subfield , which has received much less attention than its thermoelectric counterpart , thus far .    </S>",
