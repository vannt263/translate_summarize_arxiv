    "qso  2237 + 0305  was discovered by @xcite as part of the center for astrophysics galaxy redshift survey .",
    "four images have been resolved @xcite from this lens system .",
    "the quasar is at a redshift of @xmath11 and the lensing galaxy is at a redshift of @xmath12 .",
    "microlensing induced by stars in the lens galaxy was proposed for this system shortly after its discovery @xcite , and was first confirmed by @xcite .",
    "microlensing in qso  2237 + 0305  has been firmly established with extensive monitoring of this system over several years @xcite .",
    "the presence of both macrolensing and microlensing in the einstein cross and the proximity of the lensing galaxy , an order of magnitude closer than other lensing galaxies , make it a unique laboratory to explore the structure of the different emission regions in the source quasar , and the properties of the lensing galaxy as well .    during the past decades",
    ", major progress has been made in understanding the physical processes associated with active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ; however , it is beyond the capabilities of current telescopes to resolve directly the central parts of agns . observations of quasar microlensing events provide a means of exploring the structure of agns .",
    "multi - wavelength studies of qso  2237 + 0305  @xcite demonstrate that the flux ratios of the images are different in different bands , in particular , between the radio , c  iii ] , mid - infrared , and optical .",
    "the differences of flux ratios in different wavelength bands has been interpreted as the result of microlensing .",
    "emission regions with a size significantly less than the einstein radius of the microlens in the source plane will be significantly magnified , whereas , emission regions with a size significantly larger than the einstein radius will not be affected by microlensing .",
    "studies of qso  2237 + 0305  indicate that the radio and mid - infrared emission regions are larger than the einstein radius , whereas , the optical emission regions are smaller than the einstein radius .",
    "the c  iii ] emission regions also extend beyond the einstein radius but are less extended than the radio and mid - infrared regions .",
    "the analysis of light - curves of microlensing events can also constrain the source size of individual emission regions , especially in a high magnification event ( hme ) that may occur during a caustic crossing . @xcite",
    "analyzed the light - curves of qso  2237 + 0305  and estimated a source size of less than 2000 au for the optical emission region in qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "it is desirable to study the x - ray emission of a microlensed quasar since the x - rays are thought to originate from the inner most region of the accretion disc .",
    "the x - ray light - curves of the images and the profile of the  line during a microlensing event , especially from a hme , could constrain the x - ray emission region and possibly yield information about the mass and spin of the central black hole @xcite . recently , a microlensing event in x - rays was observed by @xcite in mg  j0414 + 0534 , where an enhancement of the equivalent width of the  line was observed in only one of the images .    as mentioned",
    "earlier the proximity of the lensing galaxy of 2237 + 0305 has facilitated its detailed study in several wave bands .",
    "in particular , @xcite detected a @xmath13 color difference between different image components which indicates differential extinction .",
    "the extinction curve for the lensing galaxy was measured by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the central velocity dispersion of the barred spiral galaxy 2237 + 0305 to be @xmath14 .",
    "modeling of the lens system has also provided estimates of the mass distributions of the lensing galaxy . in particular , @xcite studied the contribution of the galaxy bar to the lens potential and found a bar - mass of about @xmath15 .",
    "qso  2237 + 0305  was first detected in x - rays with _ rosat _  by @xcite ; however , due to the low spatial resolution of _ rosat _ , the individual images were not resolved .",
    "to obtain spatially resolved x - ray spectra from the individual images we performed _",
    "chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305 . here , we present the results of these observations .",
    "we use @xmath16 = 65 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 = 0.7 , unless mentioned otherwise .",
    "qso  2237 + 0305  was observed with acis @xcite onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _  for @xmath20  ks and @xmath21  ks on 2000",
    "september 6 , and 2001 december 8 , respectively .",
    "the data were taken continuously with no interruptions within each observation .",
    "qso  2237 + 0305  was placed at the aim point of the acis - s array which is on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "the data were reduced with the ciao 2.2 software tools provided by the _ chandra x - ray center _ ( cxc ) .",
    "we improved the image quality of the data by removing the pixel randomization applied to the event positions in the cxc processing and by applying a subpixel resolution technique @xcite . in the first and second observations of qso  2237 + 0305   we detected background flares with durations of @xmath22  ks and @xmath23",
    "ks , respectively .",
    "we did not remove events collected during the background flares in either of the two observations because even at the peak of the flares , the backgrounds only contribute by about 0.3% and 1% of the counts of qso  2237 + 0305  for the first and second observation , respectively . in the data analysis ,",
    "only events with standard _ asca _  grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were used .",
    "totals of 2632 and 607 source events were detected from circles centered on the centroids of the sources with radii of 3  and within the 0.2 - 10 kev energy band during the first and second observations of qso  2237 + 0305 , respectively .",
    "we applied a point spread function ( psf ) fitting method to estimate the x - ray count rates of individual images due to the closeness of the individual images .",
    "we modeled the _",
    "chandra _  images of a , b , c and d with psfs generated by the simulation tool ` marx ` @xcite .",
    "the x - ray event locations were binned with a bin - size of 00246 .",
    "the simulated psfs were fit to the _ chandra _  data by minimizing the cash @xmath24 statistic formed between the observed and simulated images of qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "the relative positions of the images were fixed to the observed _ hst _  values obtained by the cfa - arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ) .",
    "the castles website is located at ` http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/glensdata/ ` .",
    "the total count rate and count rates of individual images for each observation are listed in table  [ tab : countrate ] .",
    "the total count rate of all images for the second observation has dropped by @xmath25 compared to the first observation .",
    "the count rate ratios of images b and d with respect to image a are consistent within @xmath26 errors between the two observations , and the ratio of c / a has decreased by @xmath27 in the second observation compared to the first observation .",
    "the image of qso  2237 + 0305  obtained by combining the two _ chandra _  observations is shown in figure  [ fig : image]a .",
    "the image is binned with a binsize of 005 and smoothed with a gaussian with @xmath28 = 005 .",
    "images b and c of qso  2237 + 0305are clearly resolved in figure  [ fig : image]a .",
    "images a and d are not well resolved , but since image a is the brightest image , it is less contaminated by image d. moreover , the raw binned image of d seems to have two concentrations of photons separated by about 03 .    the lucy - richardson deconvolution technique @xcite was applied to the combined image in order to resolve the four images .",
    "we binned the x - ray events with binsizes of 01 and 005 for the deconvolution .",
    "the deconvolved images are shown in figures  [ fig : image]b and [ fig : image]c . in figure",
    "[ fig : image]b ( image binsizes of 01 ) , a total of four images are resolved , which is consistent with previous observations in other wave bands , while in figure  [ fig : image]c ( image binsizes of 005 ) , five images in total are resolved .",
    "the relative x - ray positions of the different images with respect to image a are obtained from the centroids of the deconvolved images .",
    "x - ray image positions are listed in table  [ tab : astrometry ] together with the _ hst _  positions obtained by castles .",
    "the relative positions of images b and c with respect to a as measured with the deconvolution using a 01 binsize are consistent with the _ hst _  positions to 003 .",
    "the separations between image d and the remaining images , a , b , and c as measured with the deconvolution using a 01 binsize differ from those measured in the optical by 009 , 006 , and 007 , respectively .",
    "the expected observational uncertainties of the image positions are @xmath29 , where @xmath5 is the spatial resolution of acis and s / n is the signal - to - noise ratio of the image . by accounting for the contamination of image d by image a , we estimate the uncertainty in the position of image d to be about 01 .",
    "thus , the discrepancy between the optical and x - ray positions of image d relative to image a is about @xmath26 .",
    "spectral analysis was carried out with the software tool ` xspec v11.2 ` @xcite .",
    "the total spectrum of all images of qso  2237 + 0305  was extracted from a circle of 3  radius centered on the centroid of the images .",
    "the spectra of images a , b , and c were extracted from circles of 1   radii centered on the images , and the spectrum of image d was extracted from a circle of 0.6  radius centered between d1 and d2 in order to avoid the contamination from the brightest image a. the background was extracted from an annulus centered on the centroid of the images with inner and outer radii of 5  and 30 , respectively .",
    "all spectra were fitted in the 0.48 kev energy range assuming galactic absorption of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "we have applied a correction to the ancillary response files to account for the use of relatively small extraction regions .",
    "we determined the corrections to the ancillary response files by simulating the spectra of point sources at the locations of the images with and without apertures used in our analysis . for our simulations we used ` xspec ` to generate the source spectra and the raytrace tool ` marx ` to model the dependence of photon scattering with energy . to account for the recently observed quantum efficiency decay of acis , possibly caused by molecular contamination of the acis filters ,",
    "we have applied a time - dependent correction to the acis quantum efficiency implemented in the ` xspec ` model ` acisabs1.1 ` .",
    "` acisabs ` is an ` xspec ` model contributed to the _ chandra_users software exchange web - site ` http://asc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cont-soft/sof ` ` t-list.cgi ` .",
    "the acis quantum efficiency decay is insignificant for energies above 1  kev and does not affect the main results of our analysis .",
    "we began by fitting the spectra of the individual images and the spectrum of all images of qso  2237 + 0305   from each epoch with a simple power law modified by galactic absorption and neutral absorption placed at the redshift of the lens ( @xmath31 ) . to obtain tighter constraints on the model parameters we fitted the spectra from both epochs simultaneously . in the case of the simultaneous fits , the model parameters , @xmath1 and",
    "were kept the same between observations , whereas , the normalization parameters were allowed to vary independently .",
    "we also followed a different approach of fitting the combined spectra from both epochs . in the case of the combined spectra we weighted the ancillary response files from each observation .",
    "the spectral fitting results are listed in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "the simultaneous fits ( fits 7 - 11 of table 3 ) and the combined fits ( fits 12 - 16 of table 3 ) to the spectra of qso  2237 + 0305   yield consistent results .",
    "we will use the results from the combined spectra of both epochs in the remaining analysis since they provide slightly tighter constraints .",
    "the fit to the spectrum of all images for the combined observations yields a photon index of @xmath32 and a column density of @xmath33 .",
    "the column density is relatively low compared to that detected in other galaxies . in figure  [ fig : contour ] we show the 68% confidence contours of  versus photon indices for all images .",
    "absorption from gas in the lensing galaxy is marginally detected ( at the 68% confidence level ) towards image c. for the lines of sight towards the remaining images we can only place upper limits on the neutral hydrogen column densities from the lensing galaxy . in table",
    "[ tab : spec ] we also list the 0.48  kev x - ray fluxes for fits 16 .",
    "the fluxes of individual images were normalized based on the psf fitting results in section 3 .",
    "the total 0.48  kev fluxes for the first and second observations of qso  2237 + 0305  are @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , and 0.48.0  kev lensed luminosities are @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "these luminosities have to be corrected by the lensing magnification in order to obtain the true luminosity of the quasar .",
    "the range of macro magnification was estimated from a few up to many hundred @xcite , and a recent model from @xcite estimated the magnification to be @xmath38 .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra2]a shows the spectrum of image a combined from both observations of qso  2237 + 0305  overplotted with a simple absorbed power law model described in @xmath39[sec : pow ] .",
    "the spectrum shows residuals in the 23 kev band , and the residuals are near the red - shifted energy of the  line . for a comparison in figure  [ fig : spectra2]b",
    "we show the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d for both observations overplotted with the best fit spectral model . in the combined spectrum of b , c , and d we detect residuals in the 23 kev band .",
    "however , these residuals are not as significant as those in image a and the peaks of the residuals differ between the two spectra . to model the residuals in image a we added a redshifted gaussian line component to the absorbed power - law model and present the best fit parameters in table  [ tab : iron ] .",
    "the line energy and width are kept free parameters during the fitting . including a gaussian emission line in our model for the spectrum of image",
    "a leads to a significant improvement in fit quality at the 99.99% confidence level ( according to the @xmath40-test ) .",
    "the best - fit rest - frame energy , width , and equivalent width of the modeled emission line in the spectrum of image a are @xmath6 = @xmath7  kev , @xmath8 = @xmath9  kev , and @xmath10  ev , respectively .",
    "we also modeled the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d with a redshifted gaussian component .",
    "the improvement of the fit is significant at the 94% level based on the @xmath40-test .",
    "the rest - frame energy of the modeled gaussian line of the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d is @xmath6 = @xmath41  kev and its width is consistent with that of a narrow line .",
    "@xcite argued that the f - test can not be applied to assess the significance of a line component in a spectral model because when the null values of the additional parameters ( in our case these are the parameters of the gaussian line ) fall on the boundary of the allowable parameter space , the reference distribution does not follow a f - distribution in general .",
    "@xcite proposed the method of posterior predictive p - value , a monte - carlo simulation approach , to calibrate the sample distribution of the f - statistic .",
    "we followed this approach to calibrate the sample distribution of the f - statistic for the case of the spectrum of image a combined from both observations of qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "the parameters of the null model ( powerlaw with galactic absorption and absorption at the lens ) are well constrained from the spectrum of @xmath42 photons and the simple approach described in section 5.2 of @xcite is used .",
    "we simulated 10,000 spectra with ` xspec ` from the null model with parameters fixed at their best fit value .",
    "each simulated spectrum , was binned as the real data and fitted with the null model and the alternative model ( which included an additional line component ) .",
    "the f - statistic between null and the alternative model was calculated for each simulation .",
    "the results of the monte - carlo simulation are displayed in figure  [ fig : monte ] .",
    "the maximum value of the f - statistics from the 10,000 simulated spectra is 7.28 .",
    "therefore , the f - statistic value of 7.74 obtained from the real spectrum of image a indicates that the null model ( which does not include an emission line ) is rejected at the @xmath43 99.99% confidence level .",
    "in addition , we also compared the monte - carlo simulated sample distribution with the analytical f - distribution in figure  [ fig : monte ] .",
    "the two distributions are consistent in this particular case .",
    "our spatial analysis of the _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305   has resolved the four lensed images a , b , c , and d , with positions in good agreement with those obtained from _ hst _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305 , however , both the raw and deconvolved _ chandra _  data of qso  2237 + 0305  hint to the presence of a fifth image near image d. in section 5.1 we investigate plausible mechanisms that can explain the fifth image .",
    "the analysis of the individual spectra of the images of qso  2237 + 0305   indicates the presence of absorption from the lensing galaxy . in section 5.2",
    "we compare the column densities obtained from our x - ray analysis with the column densities inferred from the @xmath13 color changes of the images .",
    "this comparison is used to estimate the dust - to - gas ratio in the lensing galaxy . in section 5.3",
    "we compare the optical and x - ray image flux ratios .",
    "an exciting finding of our spectral analysis was the identification of a broad emission line near the energy of the redshifted fe k@xmath5 line in only image a. in section 4.2 we performed monte carlo simulations to show that the line in image a is significant at the 99.99% level . in section 5.4 we rule out possible instrumental effects that could mimic such a line and discuss possible origins of the broad fe k@xmath5 line .",
    "we discuss the variability of the source in section 5.5      the _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305  indicate an additional image when the data is binned with a binsize of less than 007 both in the raw image and in the deconvolved image . the total number of photons detected in both images d1 and d2 combining the two observations of qso  2237 + 0305  is @xmath44 , thus the apparent image splitting could be the result of poor photon statistics .",
    "the difference between the optical and x - ray positions of image d is larger than that measured in the other images .",
    "this large difference in image d may be the result of the significant contamination of this image by the brighter image a. considering the 03 separation of d1 and d2 , their x - ray fluxes , and the fact that the additional images only show up in the x - ray band , it would be extremely difficult to interpret this result , if the images d1 and d2 are real .",
    "here we briefly investigate possible origins ( other than the mentioned statistical interpretation ) for the discrepancy between the optical and x - ray image configuration of qso  2237 + 0305 .",

    "if we were to attribute the additional x - ray image to macrolensing or microlensing of two distinct x - ray flares the implied distance between flares would be about 2 kpc in the source plane , considerably larger than the expected size of the x - ray emitting region .",

    "the luminosity of the additional image would be @xmath48 if the source producing the image were located in the lensing galaxy , and this is over two orders of magnitude brighter than the eddington limit for x - ray binaries .",

    "+ in principle , a gravitational macrolens could generate an odd number of images if the lens potential is non - singular .",
    "but the anticipated position of the central image should lie within the central core of the lens potential and be greatly demagnified , which is not consistent with the _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "\\(f ) microlensing by solar - mass stars in the central bulge of the lensing galaxy . +",
    "the image separation produced by a microlens of mass m is given by the expression @xcite , where @xmath51 is the angular diameter distance between observer and lens .",
    "the interpretation of the 03 image splitting of image d as a microlensing event would require a microlens mass of at least @xmath52 . the einstein radius of the microlens at the source plane is proportional to the square - root of the mass of the microlens , specifically for this system , @xmath53  cm .",
    "the optical and radio images should also show this splitting if such a large `` microlens '' were present , unless the optical and radio emission regions are far more extended than the einstein radius .",
    "this could possibly be true for the radio emission , but studies of microlensing of qso  2237 + 0305  showed that the optical emission region is within 1  pc of the accretion disc of the central engine @xcite , which make the above interpretation highly improbable .      in the appendix of @xcite ,",
    "the extinctions for the images of qso  2237 + 0305  were estimated based on the @xmath54 color changes between the images @xcite , and the correlation between the @xmath54 color change and the lens galaxy surface brightness @xcite .",

    "the ratio of the column densities obtained from our x - ray analysis to those inferred from the extinction values are about 20% , 13% , 6% , and 5% for image c , b , a , and d , respectively .",
    "the estimated large value for  inferred from the extinction measurements could arise from a problem with one of our two assumptions ; the extinction law and the gas - to - dust ratio taken to be that of the milky way .",
    "the extinction law of the lensing galaxy 2237 + 0305 has been measured by @xcite assuming , where a(k ) and a(v ) are the extinctions in the k band and v band , respectively .",
    "they find that the resulting extinction law in qso  2237 + 0305  is in good agreement with that of the milky way .",
    "thus , we are left with the possibility that the dust - to - gas ratio of the lensing galaxy 2237 + 0305 is significantly larger than that of the milky way .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratios for several gravitational lenses are discussed by @xcite .",
    "they found that the dust - to - gas ratios are small for the systems b0218 + 357 and pks  1830 - 211 , which is opposite to what we observed in qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "it is well established from optical monitoring that qso",
    "2237 + 0305  is being microlensed as mentioned in the introduction section .",
    "we compared the x - ray flux ratios of qso  2237 + 0305  with the optical v band flux ratios from the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) monitoring data obtained only four days prior to our first observation .",
    "an optical flux close to our second observation was not available .",
    "the ogle website is at ` http://bulge.princeton.edu/~ogle ` .",
    "the extinction for the optical data is corrected based on the method described in appendix of @xcite .",
    "to compute the x - ray flux ratios we used the 28  kev band to avoid the complication of absorption which may affect the soft energy band to a greater degree .",
    "the results from this comparison are presented in table  [ tab : fluxratio ] .",
    "the x - ray and optical v band flux ratios of images b , c , and d relative to image a are consistent .",
    "since the optical fluxes are influenced by microlensing the agreement between x - ray and optical v band flux ratios implies that the x - ray fluxes are also magnified by microlensing .",
    "we also listed the 28  kev flux ratios , with larger error bars though , for the second observation in table  [ tab : fluxratio ] .",
    "our spectral analysis indicates the presence of significant residuals between energies of 23  kev in image a. this energy region is near the energy of the red - shifted fe k@xmath5 line .",
    "unfortunately , these residuals fall near a sudden change of the hrma / acis effective area caused by the iridium m absorption edges of the _ chandra _  mirrors . to ascertain any systematic calibration uncertainties near the mirror edge we have fit the spectra of several test - sources with expected smooth power - law spectra near the 2  kev iridium edge .",
    "since @xmath59 residuals depend on the statistics , we filtered the test - source data in time to produce spectra with a total number of counts equal to that observed in the second observation of qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "typical residuals for these test - sources near the mirror edge are less than @xmath45 1@xmath28 indicating that the observed consecutive 2@xmath28 residuals near 2  kev in the spectrum of image a are real and not due to systematic errors in the calibration of the effective area of the _ chandra _  mirrors .",
    "we also note that the residuals are more significant in image a ( at the 99.99% confidence level ) than the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d ( at the 94% confidence level ) .",
    "furthermore , the energies and widths of the lines in image a and the remaining images differ significantly .",
    "it is unlikely that the residuals are caused by pile - up .",
    "we simulated , using the software tool ` lynx ` ( see appendix a of chartas et  al .",
    "2000 ) , a piled - up spectrum with input model parameters taken from fit 2 of table 3 and using the observed count rate in image a of 0.16 counts per frame .",
    "we find no evidence that the residuals are due to pile up . to further",
    "test whether pile up is the cause of the observed residuals , we excluded events from the core of image a. after the removal of the core , the remaining spectrum of image a still shows residuals between 2 and 3  kev .",
    "we conclude that a broad fe k@xmath5 line is present in the spectrum of image a.    the presence of a broad fe k@xmath5 line in image a and not in the other images is indicative that microlensing may be enhancing the redshifted emission near the black hole .",
    "observational and theoretical arguments rule out interpretations other than microlensing .",
    "first , strong and broad fe k@xmath5 lines detected in several low luminosity seyfert galaxies are rarely observed in quasars .",
    "this fact is further supported by the observed anti - correlation between the luminosities of agn and the equivalent widths of fe k@xmath5 lines detected in these agn @xcite and by theoretical estimates of the properties of fe k@xmath5 lines in quasars @xcite .",
    "recently , fe k@xmath5 lines with equivalent widths of @xmath45 1  kev were observed in the quasars h  1413 + 117   @xcite and mg j0414 + 0534 @xcite .",
    "however , these quasars are both gravitationally lensed and these relatively large equivalent widths were interpreted as the result of microlensing @xcite .",
    "second , an interpretation suggesting that the broad line in image a of qso  2237 + 0305   is being emitted by an x - ray flare which is only seen in image a is not supported by the _ chandra _  observations . in particular , the predicted time - delays between images a and b , a and c , and a and d are @xmath45 2 , 16 , and 5  hours , respectively @xcite .",
    "if the flare duration is longer than a few days , we would have detected a similar enhanced and broadened fe k@xmath5 line in the spectrum of the combined images of b , c , and d , since the relative time - delays are less than a day . for a flare duration of less than @xmath60  hours",
    "we would have detected significant variability of the strength and shape of the fe k@xmath5 line during the first observation .",
    "we did not detect such variability during the first observation , and therefore , rule out flares with durations of less than 8.4 hours as being responsible for the broad fe k@xmath5 line detected in image a only .    in the following arguments we assume that the difference between the spectrum of image a and the combined spectrum of images b , c , and d is produced by microlensing , which magnifies the inner part of the accretion disc .",
    "the broadening and the observed redshift of the fe k@xmath5 line in the spectrum of image a imply that the emission originates near the center of the black hole where special and general relativistic effects are important .",
    "the broad and redshifted profile of the fe k@xmath5 line and its large equivalent width also indicate that the microlensing caustic should be located near the broad fe k@xmath5 line emission region .",
    "the broad fe k@xmath5 line emission region where special and general relativistic effects are important is expected to be very small @xmath61 and the magnification of this relatively small emission region close to a fold caustic scales approximately as the inverse square root of its distance to the caustic .",
    "this microlensing event is fundamentally different from those discussed in theoretical studies of optical and uv broad emission lines ( e.g. popovi@xmath62 , mediavilla , & mu@xmath63 oz 2001 ; abajas et  al .",
    "2002 ) in that the locations and sizes of the emission regions and the line broadening mechanisms are all different .",
    "@xcite discussed the influence of microlensing on the shape of the fe k@xmath5 line in agn .",
    "a qualitative comparison between the profile of the observed broad fe k@xmath5 line in image a and the theoretical predictions of @xcite also indicates that the microlensing caustic should be located near the broad fe k@xmath5 line emission region .",
    "the microlensing interpretation has to explain the following facts indicated by the comparison of the optical and x - ray observations of qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "first , the ogle photometric data show no peak in the v band light - curve of image a during the september 2000 observation .",
    "the v band light - curve of image a shows a microlensing event that peaked about ten months earlier than the first _",
    "chandra _  observation .",
    "delays between the peaks of the x - ray and optical light - curves have been simulated to occur in caustic crossings in the case where the x - ray and optical emission regions differ significantly @xcite .",
    "as we mentioned earlier the estimated size of the x - ray broad fe k@xmath5 line region where special and general relativistic effects would produce the observed distortion of the fe k@xmath5 line is @xmath45 10  @xmath64 , whereas , the size of the optical and x - ray continuum emission regions are @xmath65  cm and @xmath66  cm , respectively .",
    "the size of the x - ray continuum region is based on the observed x - ray variability of the continuum in image a of about @xmath45  3000  sec ( proper time ) which corresponds to a size of about @xmath66  cm ( see section 5.5 for more details ) .",
    "the optical emission region has been constrained to be @xmath67 6 @xmath46 10@xmath68  cm @xcite .",
    "these sizes of emission regions are similar to those assumed in the simulations performed by @xcite that showed significant delays in the peaks of the magnification light - curves originating from different emission regions .",
    "we note that the radiation mechanisms assumed for the emission regions in the simulations of @xcite may differ from those in qso  2237 + 0305 , however , the main contribution to the simulated delays in the peaks arises from the different sizes of the emission regions .",
    "second , the optical and x - ray continuum flux ratios are consistent within @xmath26 at the time of the first _",
    "chandra _  observation .",
    "this is possible since both the x - ray and optical continuum regions are much larger than the fe k@xmath5 line emission region , as we discussed above , and they are both comparable in size with the einstein radius of a typical 0.1  microlens .",
    "the simulations of @xcite also showed that the flux magnifications for the x - ray and optical extended emission regions are not significantly different during the microlensing event .",
    "detailed modeling of a caustic crossing that includes both the optical and x - ray constraints of qso  2237 + 0305  are needed to accurately interpret the microlensing event in qso  2237 + 0305 .",
    "however , such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we investigated the long term variability of qso  2237 + 0305  by comparing the fluxes of the two _ chandra _  observations with the flux observed in the previous _ rosat _  observation .",
    "the 0.48  kev and 0.12.4  kev fluxes of qso  2237 + 0305   are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , for the first _",
    "chandra _  observation . the 0.12.4  kev flux detected with the first _ chandra _",
    "observation is consistent with that previously detected with _",
    "rosat _  @xcite . a comparison between the two _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305shows that the total 0.48  kev flux has decreased by about 20% in the second observation .",
    "it is not clear from the present _ chandra _  data if this decrease in x - ray flux is caused by intrinsic variability of the quasar or by microlensing .",
    "we also explored the variability of qso  2237 + 0305  within each observation .",
    "the light - curves of the combined images and the individual images a , b , c , and d for the first and second observation are displayed in figure  [ fig : lca ] .",
    "we performed kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests to the unbinned light - curves of each image .",
    "the k - s test results are listed in table  [ tab : ks ] .",
    "the k - s results indicate that the light - curve of image a for the first observation is variable at the 97% confidence level .",
    "the k - s plot of the cumulative probability distribution versus the exposure number for image a of the first observation is illustrated in figure  [ fig : ksa ] .",
    "the light - curve of the combined images for the first observation also shows some variability according to the k - s test , however , at a lower @xmath45 90% confidence level . in this light - curve",
    "we identified two possible flux enhancements . a comparison between the light - curve of all images and that of image a indicated that the first enhancement in the total light - curve corresponds to the bump detected at a similar time in the light - curve of image a. the correspondence of the second flux enhancement of the total light - curve with bumps in individual light - curves is less clear than the first bump .",
    "it is possible that the second bump arises in image b. we performed an auto - correlation of the total light - curve for the first observation and obtained a lag of 5 bins ( 1 bin = 1944.6 seconds ) which yields a maximum auto - correlation coefficient of 0.40 .",
    "the probability of obtaining this auto - correlation coefficient by chance is 0.06 .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of the computed lag - time to the selected bin size of the total light - curve by performing the auto - correlation over a range of bin sizes . in all cases we recovered lag - times similar to the one obtained above .",
    "our simple auto - correlation analysis indicated a possible time - delay of @xmath71 in the total light - curve of qso  2237 + 0305  for the first _",
    "chandra _  observation .",
    "the errors of this time - delay are dominated by the different choices of the bin size .",
    "a comparison between the total light - curve and those of the individual images indicates that the measured time - delay most likely corresponds to the time - delay between images a and b with image a leading .",
    "this is consistent with recent modeling of @xcite that predict a time - delay between images a and b of @xmath72  hours with image a leading .",
    "1 .   _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305  have resolved the system into at least four x - ray images .",
    "a possible fifth image could be the result of poor photon statistics and the contamination from the brightest image a. a longer _ chandra _  observation of qso  2237 + 0305  is needed to resolve this issue .",
    "the x - ray flux ratios of images b , c , and d with respect to image a are consistent with the v band flux ratios observed only four days prior to our first _",
    "chandra _  observation .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray fluxes are also magnified by microlensing as expected since the x - rays are thought to originate from the inner most regions of the accretion disc .",
    "3 .   the hydrogen column densities of images a , b , c , and d measured from the _ chandra _  observations of qso  2237 + 0305are significantly lower than the column densities inferred from extinction measurements of these images in the optical and infrared bands .",
    "this difference is suggestive of a higher value of the dust - to - gas ratio in the lensing galaxy compared to the galactic value .",
    "4 .   our spectral analysis indicates the presence of a broad fe k@xmath5 line in image a with a rest - frame energy , width , and equivalent width of @xmath6 = @xmath7  kev , @xmath8 = @xmath9  kev and @xmath10  ev , respectively .",
    "the enhancement of the emission line in image a is possibly caused by microlensing since the combined spectrum of the other three images does not show such a significant feature .",
    "the redshift and broadening of the line may be the result of the doppler effect and special and general relativistic effects .",
    "qso  2237 + 0305  exhibits variability both over long and short time scales from the _ chandra _  observations .",
    "the x - ray flux has dropped by 20% between the two observations , and the kolmogorov - smirnov test showed that image a is variable at the 97% confidence level within the first observation . a possible time - delay of @xmath71 between images a and b with image a leading is detected in the first _",
