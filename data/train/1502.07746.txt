    "the success of big bang cosmology in predicting the correct abundances of the light elements and the existence of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) rests upon the assumption that the universe began in a hot , dense state and as the universe expanded it cooled .",
    "this _ thermal history _ for the early universe can then be used to try to understand the primordial origin of dark matter particles , baryons , and the matter / anti - matter asymmetry .",
    "this picture is simple , elegant , and robust , but it can not be complete . indeed , the primordial density perturbations ",
    "indirectly detected through the temperature anisotropies of the cmb and required for the growth of the large - scale structure of the universe  can not be causally generated in a strictly thermal universe .",
    "instead , inflation provides the most compelling model for their origin , and during this epoch the universe was not in thermal equilibrium .",
    "moreover , following inflation the universe must _ reheat _ providing the hot big bang .",
    "this process can occur far from equilibrium and result in an effectively matter dominated epoch that could last up to the time of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .    given the importance of realizing inflation and reheating",
    ", model building has had a rich and long history ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) . `",
    "chaotic ' inflation provides one of the simplest examples , where inflation is of the so - called large field type with the inflaton evolving over super - planckian distances in the field space .",
    "some of these models can lead to detectable gravitational wave signals , but they are also sensitive to planck scale physics and dangerous quantum gravity corrections . as a result , a large effort has been put forth to understand how to construct models in the controlled framework of string theory .",
    "one lesson from these studies is that typically additional symmetries ( such as supersymmetry ( susy ) ) and additional scalar fields ( moduli ) are generic and necessary ingredients for constructing realistic models .",
    "the former are necessary for protecting the inflaton potential from dangerous uv corrections , whereas moduli are a ubiquitous prediction resulting from both the presence of these new symmetries , as well as the string construction itself .",
    "if unstable these moduli can spoil inflation , or lead to undesirable late - time effects such as large entropy production after bbn or fifth force violations of general relativity .",
    "thus , although string theory provides a framework to construct realistic models of inflation , it appears to introduce a new nuisance  the cosmological moduli problem @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been made on moduli stabilization both during and after inflation ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "many of the moduli have been shown to be stabilized with string scale masses by accounting for a combination of effects resulting from the presence of branes , fluxes , and/or strong hidden sector dynamics  all of which are expected ingredients of the theory .",
    "however , in explicitly constructed examples it is also a common result that many of the moduli will remain parametrically lighter than the string scale .",
    "the resulting cosmology differs from that of a strictly thermal post - inflationary history .",
    "these fields are displaced from their low - energy minima in the early universe and undergo coherent oscillations , mimicking a matter dominated epoch prior to bbn .",
    "the fields typically decay late through gravitational strength couplings , and the universe reheats ( again ) via the production of relativistic standard model and other light ( beyond the standard model ) particles . depending on the masses and couplings to other fields , such as dark matter and baryons",
    ", this can lead to a new expectation for the post - inflationary cosmology prior to bbn .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we review the cosmological moduli problem and briefly comment on its appearance in effective supergravity descriptions of string / m - theory . in section [ dm_section ]",
    "we discuss the effect of cosmological moduli on the thermal history of dark matter .",
    "we look at the non - thermal wimp miracle and its phenomenological status , as well as axions from string theory and their status as dark matter candidates within non - thermal histories . in section [ baryosection ] ,",
    "we study the impact of cosmoligical moduli on theories of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , critically reviewing the affleck - dine mechanism and the baryon - dark matter cosmic coincidence . in section [ cmblssdm ] , we study cosmological moduli in the context of the cmb and large scale structure , looking at implications for the matter power spectrum , effective number of neutrino species , and isocurvature constraints .",
    "we end with a section on the challenges and future prospects of these scenarios .",
    "to see how a non - thermal history arises from moduli , we consider a single modulus which enjoys a classical shift symmetry @xmath0 . at low energy",
    "we expect the symmetry to be broken , resulting in a mass for the field @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , if the presence of this new symmetry is tied to addressing the electroweak hierarchy problem ( e.g. in susy or extra dimensional approaches ) then we expect @xmath2 with @xmath3 gev the reduced planck mass .",
    "the non - thermal history arises from the observation that there is no _ a - priori _ reason why the modulus @xmath4 should initially begin in its low - energy minimum .",
    "both thermal and quantum fluctuations can displace the scalar during the early evolution leading to a matter dominated phase @xcite .    as an explicit example , consider string moduli in susy based approaches where on general grounds we expect that the shift symmetry of the modulus should be broken by both the finite energy density of inflation ( which spontaneously breaks susy at the high energy ) and quantum gravity effects @xcite .",
    "these considerations imply additional contributions to the effective potential in the form of a hubble scale mass and a tower of non - renormalizable operators , [ potentialex ] v_1 = -c_1 h_i^2 ^2 + ^4+n +  , where in the absence of special symmetries @xmath5 and @xmath6 are expected to be positive based on causality , unitarity , and demanding that the model have a uv completion ( although a few known counter - examples exist in gravitational systems ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details . on the other hand ,",
    "the choice of @xmath5 positive ( leading to a tachyonic mass ) is chosen to realize the general expectation that the high energy and low energy minima of the field would not generically be expected to coincide in a gravitational and/or time dependent background @xcite .",
    "ideally one would like to calculate this in an explicit , uv complete model . ]",
    "order one constants , @xmath7 is the hubble rate during inflation , and @xmath8 is the scale of new physics , e.g. quantum gravity . as this will be important later , we note that the dimension of the leading irrelevant operator that lifts the flat direction is model dependent as well as the scale of new physics and string scale @xmath9 where @xmath10 is required for consistency of the effective theory @xcite . ] .",
    "because the contributions ( [ potentialex ] ) are the dominant terms in the potential during high scale inflation ( @xmath11 ) , this implies the minimum of the field at that time will be ~m ( ) ^ .",
    "[ eqn : sig_vev_inf ] whereas , later the low - energy susy breaking mass will give the dominant contributions to the potential , and this minimum is near @xmath12 . this initial displacement from the low energy minimum eventually leads to coherent oscillations of the field and the formation of a scalar condensate .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations is determined by the initial displacement @xmath13 , where for the potential ( [ potentialex ] ) we have @xmath14 .",
    "hubble friction ceases and oscillations set in when the expansion rate satisfies @xmath15 .",
    "because the oscillations scale like matter , they dilute more slowly than the primordial radiation ( produced during inflationary reheating ) . depending on the initial value @xmath16 ,",
    "the energy stored in the moduli may quickly come to dominate the energy density of the universe . at the time oscillations",
    "begin @xmath17 the initial abundance is given by _",
    "( t _ ) = m_^2 _ ^2 , and once the oscillations become coherent ( which typically takes less than a hubble time ) they will scale as pressure - less matter @xcite with @xmath18 . the universe remains matter dominated until the field decays . because the field is a modulus",
    "we expect it typically to be gravitationally coupled to other particles and so its decay rate is [ decayrate ] _",
    "= , where we expect @xmath19 and @xmath20 depends on the precise coupling in the fundamental lagrangian , but typically takes values of at most @xmath21 .",
    "most of the field decays .",
    "however , this approximation can be misleading .",
    "for example , in the case where the radiation energy density significantly drops below the moduli energy density ( @xmath22 ) , the continuous ( even though small ) amounts of particle decay before reheating can lead to changes in the scale factor - temperature relation because the entropy is _ not _ conserved .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for further discussion . ] at the time @xmath23 and we expect it to decay democratically to standard model particles and their super - partners .",
    "any heavy super - partners produced will typically decay rapidly into the lightest susy partner ( lsp ) , which is stable and could provide a viable dark matter candidate ( more on this in section [ dm_section ] ) .",
    "in addition to dark matter , light standard model particles that are produced will thermalize and ` reheat ' the universe for a second time ( with inflationary reheating occurring early and at high temperature ) . the corresponding reheat temperature is given by @xmath24 or [ tr ] t_r = c^1/2 ( ) ^1/4 ( ) ^3/2 t_bbn , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at @xmath27 , and this temperature must be larger than around @xmath28 mev to be in agreement with bbn light element abundances @xcite .",
    "the left timeline represents a thermal history for the early universe where dark matter wimps are populated in the thermal bath that emerges shortly after after inflationary reheating .",
    "the right timeline represents a moduli dominated , non - thermal history , where the universe evolves as a matter dominated universe up until the decay time which must be before bbn.,width=384 ]    a comparison between the standard thermal history and that of the non - thermal history appears in figure [ fig1 ] for an interesting case where the modulus decays slightly before bbn and inflationary reheating occurs at a high temperature .",
    "we now turn to the question of what moduli masses ( and so reheat temperatures ) are naturally expected from string / m - theory approaches .      for an interesting departure from a thermal post - inflationary universe",
    "the mass of the lightest modulus should be in a window between @xmath29 tev .",
    "for masses much further above the upper bound little departure from a thermal universe is expected , whereas the lower bound is required for consistency with bbn as seen from . as a phenomenological approach non - thermal cosmologies",
    "have been considered for their implications for dark matter ( see @xcite for a review ) . however , lacking theoretical motivation these models are arguably somewhat exotic .    the key question is  _ should one generally expect a modulus in this mass range ? _ in string / m - theory approaches , inextricably connected with the question of moduli masses is the question of the gravitino mass .",
    "this is because moduli stabilization plays a central role in the nature of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the potential of the moduli determines their f - terms dynamically , and along with the kahler metric of the matter sector , determines the strength of gravity mediation . to extract the mass of the modulus , it is sufficient to write down its scalar potential in the supergravity limit ( given in terms of its superpotential and kahler potential , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) [ sp ] v = e^k / m_p^2 ( _ | d_w ^2 - )",
    "one requires , at the extremum , that @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "moreover , @xmath34 is required to obtain an almost vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "we note that the gravitino mass is defined as @xmath35 where we work in units of @xmath36 for simplicity .",
    "this set of conditions is restrictive enough to give a relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , without going into the details of visible sector model - building .",
    "since the modulus mass matrix is positive definite by assumption and both terms in are comparable to @xmath39 due to the condition @xmath34 , one obtains that the smallest eigenvalue of the mass matrix should be @xmath40 . for a single modulus",
    ", this trivially implies @xmath41 .",
    "however , the modulus must be redefined to the physical basis with canonical kinetic term .",
    "an example kahler potential is given by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the volume form whose expression in terms of the moduli depends on the compactification manifold through the intersection numbers . in a basis with canonical kinetic terms",
    ", the lightest modulus will generally have a non - trivial profile along different field directions .",
    "however , for many settings that provide realistic phenomenology , the lightest modulus is also the largest , and one can approximate @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "this is the case in single modulus examples like kklt @xcite , as well as the cases of large volume compactifications in type iib @xcite and @xmath46 compactifications of m - theory @xcite . in that case , the canonical normalization yields @xmath47 , where by abuse of notation @xmath4 is now the physical field .",
    "one thus obtains [ modgravcorr ] m _",
    "usually , one finds @xmath48 in the supergravity regime .",
    "for example , if the modulus is stabilized supersymmetrically so that @xmath49 , then @xmath50",
    ". then , under quite general circumstances one expects [ modgravcorr2 ] m _ ~(1 - 100 ) m_3/2 . for @xmath51 tev , as one would expect in models that at least partially address the electroweak hierarchy problem , we see that @xmath37 falls within the mass range where a non - thermal history results .",
    "we would like to emphasize the interesting result that * the lower bound on the mass required to address the cosmological moduli problem provides further motivation for a little hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the scale of new scalar physics*. indeed , the discovery of a @xmath52 gev higgs at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  and nothing else  appears to have left the relevance of supersymmetry ( susy ) in question , particularly as a mechanism for stabilizing the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scales .",
    "standard model light superpartners ( ` natural ' ) susy still remains possible , but with some cost of increasing the level of complexity of models ( see e.g. @xcite ) . within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , there are a number of alternative ways to reconcile susy with the data , including models of split - susy @xcite , or simply by accepting that some fine - tuning may just be an accident of nature .",
    "regardless of one s viewpoint , it seems that if low - energy susy will prevail it will require the existence of a new scale at around @xmath53 tev .",
    "it is then remarkable that in these string / m - theory based approaches with moduli that the scale required to avoid the cosmological moduli problem is of the correct order of magnitude for realistic particle phenomenology with a @xmath52 gev higgs .",
    "another interesting result of this string - based framework is that * the reheat temperature is not a free parameter , but a consequence of the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scale * ( determined by @xmath54 ) , which also helps determine the susy breaking masses of other sparticles in the theory . in both supergravity and string motivated approaches ,",
    "the key lesson is that the reheat temperature is intimately connected to other aspects of the theory and not a free and tunable parameter . given that gravitationally coupled scalars or moduli are generic in high energy uv completions of the standard model and in no sense exotic , we see that non - thermal histories are a feasible and robust possibility , and perhaps an inevitable one . given this motivation from theory , we now turn to the observational consequences of non - thermal histories .",
    "the origin of dark matter as a thermal relic is a simple and predictive scenario for its creation , which is also independent of the prior thermal history of the universe .",
    "however , as we have argued so far , one is led on compelling theoretical grounds to a re - evaluation of the history of the universe prior to bbn .",
    "this necessitates looking afresh at the consequences of non - thermal histories on dark matter phenomenology , a topic to which we turn in this section . in our choice of dark matter candidates , we will discuss both weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) and axions .      if the primordial universe is thermalized , massive long - lived particles may freeze - out with a final abundance determined primarily by their mass and annihilation cross - section @xcite .",
    "this is the basis of thermal wimps , which assumes a weak - scale cross - section , @xmath4 and @xmath55 @xmath56s , where @xmath57 is the typical velocity . alternatively , _ non - thermal _ dark matter is produced via the decay of heavier particles into a long - lived final state and does not require thermal equilibrium  @xcite ( for reviews , see @xcite , and for recent related work @xcite ) .",
    "dark matter models are constrained by both direct detection experiments and searches for astrophysical signals generated by their annihilation products .",
    "non - thermal dark matter can have a higher annihilation cross - section than thermal dark matter so astrophysical signals are potentially stronger for these scenarios , particularly in indirect experiments such as fermi and ams-2 @xcite .",
    "we now review the thermal and non - thermal wimp paradigms .",
    "the standard picture of the cosmic history assumes that the universe is radiation dominated prior to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and that dark matter is created from the thermal bath created at the end of inflation .",
    "the evolution of dark matter is described by the boltzmann equation [ wimp1 ] _ x = -3 h n_x - v , where @xmath58 is the thermally averaged cross - section , @xmath59 is the number density , and @xmath60 is the number density of the species in chemical equilibrium , i.e. @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a relativistic particle . in the early universe with @xmath63 ,",
    "the dark matter is relativistic and in thermal equilibrium with the plasma , and its density is determined by the full solution to . when @xmath64 , it becomes boltzmann suppressed , until finally the expansion rate becomes larger than the annihilation rate , leading to thermal ` freeze - out ' .",
    "the dark matter density at this time is sensitive only to its mass and annihilation cross - section .",
    "thus , the thermal paradigm is simple , predictive , and more or less independent of the underlying microscopic physics .",
    "moreover , there is the suggestive fact that the observed relic density is satisfied for @xmath65@xmath66s@xmath67 ( or @xmath68 picobarn ) , which corresponds to weak scale interactions .",
    "the weak scale is precisely where new physics is expected to appear , on very different physical grounds .",
    "plausibly , then , dark matter is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) that is there as a part of new physics at the weak scale , motivated by issues like the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "the thermal wimp miracle is precisely this combination of simplicity and serendipity .",
    "since the weak scale is also the energy scale that we are currently able to probe experimentally , the thermal wimp is by far the most actively studied dark matter candidate .      despite its appeal",
    ", we saw in section [ sec2 ] that there are compelling reasons to expect that the history of the universe prior to bbn was not as simple as the thermal wimp paradigm requires .",
    "it is worthwhile to revisit the assumptions underlying the arguments above .",
    "they are : @xmath69 wimps reached chemical equilibrium in the early universe ; @xmath70 the universe was radiation dominated at the time of freeze - out ; @xmath71 following freeze - out , there was no dilution of the relic density due to entropy production from any sources , and conversely , there was no further production of dark matter from late - time sources .",
    "the above assumptions look difficult to realize from a top - down perspective ( and are in increasing tension with data from the bottom - up perspective , as we will discuss in section  [ bottomup ] ) . indeed , as we discussed in section [ sec2 ] assumptions such as wimps achieving thermal equilibrium , the absence of entropy production following thermal freeze - out , and strictly a radiation dominated universe prior to bbn seem to be in conflict with top - down approaches to model building .",
    "in particular , the presence of moduli imply violations of all these conditions .",
    "this by itself does not mean , however , that the thermal wimp paradigm itself is disfavored , although a purely thermal history of the universe prior to bbn is .",
    "moduli may decay _ early enough _ ( above the freeze - out temperature of wimps ) to render a prior non - thermal history irrelevant as far as low - energy observables are concerned .",
    "the entropy dilution from such very early decay is likely to erase the prior dark matter density and produce it afresh ( by reheating the modulus into the visible sector generally ) .",
    "the dark matter thus produced will then have time to thermalize and give the usual thermal wimp story .",
    "a non - thermal wimp is obtained if a modulus decays _",
    "after _ the freeze - out temperature but _ before _ the onset of bbn .",
    "this translates into a window in terms of the decay width , and hence in terms of parameters of the fundamental theory ( such as the modulus mass and overall decay constant ) .",
    "leading up to we have argued that it is natural for moduli to fall within this mass window , and in fact the explicitly studied compactifications in the literature have such moduli .",
    "moduli decay dilutes any previous population of dark matter by a factor @xmath72 , which is typically large enough to render it irrelevant .",
    "this scaling can be understood from the fact that the temperature goes as @xmath73 , while volumes scale as @xmath74 ( where @xmath75 is the scale factor ) .",
    "+ the moduli decay is expected to produce dark matter and as a result there are two options :    @xmath76 if the wimp number density exceeds the critical value @xmath77 , then the wimps will quickly annihilate down to this value , which acts as an attractor @xcite .",
    "the fixed point value is evaluated at the reheating temperature instead of the freeze - out temperature .",
    "this results in a parametric enhancement of the relic density [ tandntrelation ] ^nt_dm = ^t_dm ( ) . since the relic density scales inversely with the annihilation cross section , this implies that wimp candidates with annihilation cross sections larger than the canonical value by a factor @xmath78 can give the correct relic density in a non - thermal history with the above compensating factor .",
    "examples of such wimps are the winos and higgsinos of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) . for future reference",
    ", we will call this option the annihilation scenario .    in more detail , the standard expression for the thermal relic density given by [ thermal1 ] _",
    "dm^th^2 = ( ) ( ) using ( [ tandntrelation ] ) , ( [ thermal1 ] ) and ( [ nt1 ] ) one can estimate the relic density in non - thermal dark matter as [ nt1 ] _ dm^nth^2 & & 0.76 ( ) ( ) , + & & 0.10 ( ) ( ) ^1/4 ( ) ( ) ^3/2 , where in the last line we used the entropy density today @xmath79 with @xmath80 the hubble parameter in units of @xmath81 km / s / mpc and we chose some fiducial values with @xmath82 the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the time of reheating .",
    "we note that unlike the thermal result depends on both the properties of the dark matter ( mass and annihilation rate ) and on the mass of the decaying modulus ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "as discussed in section [ sec2 ] the scalar mass ( and so reheat temperature ) is _ not _ a free parameter , but related to the gravitino mass .",
    "the mass of the scalar ( and so the relic density of dark matter ) is controlled by the need for susy to generate a hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scale .",
    "we have chosen a fiducial value for the annihilation rate that yields roughly the right amount of dark matter for the hierarchy set by the choice of low - scale susy breaking .",
    "the cross - section is three orders of magnitude higher than expected with a thermal history with important experimental consequences , as discussed next in section [ bottomup ] .",
    "@xmath83 the second option we will call the ` branching scenario ' . in this case , the wimp number density produced from moduli decay is below the fixed point value .",
    "this implies that there is no further wimp annihilations and the final number density is that produced from the decay , i.e. , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the branching ratio for scalar decay to wimps and @xmath86 is the number density of the scalar condensate . with an appropriate choice of @xmath87 ( that very much depends on the microphysics ) , this option can accommodate wimps whose annihilation cross section is higher and ( crucially ) also lower than the canonical value .",
    "note that the latter case ( a pure bino of the mssm ) can not be accommodated in any thermal setting without substantial fine - tuning of the spectrum .",
    "we have seen that in theories with moduli and tev scale susy breaking that a non - thermal history is attractive . when considering the associated phenomenology , it is non - trivial to avoid this conclusion without introducing fine - tuning .",
    "for example , one could raise both the gravitino and modulus mass , re - introducing the gauge hierarchy fine - tuning , or one could decouple the modulus - gravitino correlation in making the modulus much heavier as in racetrack models @xcite .",
    "this introduces large fine - tuning that is not associated with the cosmological constant .    from a bottom - up perspective ,",
    "one of the most striking aspects of the thermal wimp paradigm is how difficult it is to realize even with the large number of parameters within the mssm .",
    "taking neutralinos as the wimp candidates , the wino and higgsino  which annihilate very efficiently  must be very heavy ( @xmath88 tev and @xmath89 tev , respectively ) to give the correct relic density through thermal freeze - out @xcite . whereas a thermal bino typically gives a relic density that is too high , unless its annihilation cross section is boosted through major co - annihilation effects @xcite or mixing with the higgsino @xcite .",
    "both of these options are fine - tuned and the latter is highly constrained by direct detection @xcite .",
    "however , within non - thermal histories wino or higgsino dark matter with masses of @xmath90 gev can be accommodated within the annihilation scenario discussed above . moreover , bino dark matter with a non - thermal history following the branching scenario can satisfy the relic density constraint , without relying on any other low - energy ingredient .",
    "thus , an experimental confirmation of a pure gauge eigenstate of the mssm as the dark matter of the universe would seem to suggest that the universe underwent a non - thermal history , since otherwise one would need to accept a large amount of fine - tuning .",
    "direct detection limits are currently unable to probe such pure eigenstates , whose scattering cross - section off of standard model nuclei is typically @xmath91 @xmath92 , although future facilities like xenon1 t and lz will reach the required sensitivity up to wimp masses of @xmath93 tev @xcite .",
    "indirect detection provides an enormous amount of information by putting upper bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross section . a joint analysis of seven milky way dwarf galaxies using a frequentist neyman construction and",
    "pass 7 data from the fermi gamma - ray space telescope undertaken in @xcite excludes generic thermal wimp candidates with mass less than @xmath94 gev annihilating to @xmath95 final states .",
    "current limits using dwarf spheroidals data and the pass-8 software from fermi - lat collaboration rule out the canonical wimp for masses below @xmath96  gev .",
    "wimps in this mass range thus over - satisfy the relic density in a purely thermal history .",
    "since multi - component dark matter is not an option in this case , the only way wimps lighter than @xmath96 gev can constitute the dark matter of the universe is if they followed a non - thermal branching scenario cosmological history @xcite .",
    "as this exclusion reach becomes larger , it forces more and more potential candidates squarely into the non - thermal framework .",
    "on the other hand , candidates like winos and higgsinos with large annihilation cross section are now severely bounded by a combination of continuum and line searches from fermi data @xcite .",
    "continuum photons arise from the tree level annihilation process @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the wimp .",

    "similar exclusion bounds hold for any general scalar dark matter candidate that is a triplet under @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "cmb measurements are another source of constraint for non - thermal histories .",
    "we reserve a full discussion of this for section [ cmblssdm ] , here we briefly mention how cmb observations can lead to constraints on the self - annihilation rate of non - thermal dark matter .",
    "these constraints arise because energy injection from increased dark matter annihilation can alter the recombination history leading to changes in the temperature and polarization power spectra of the cmb @xcite .",
    "we have seen that non - thermal dark matter can have a larger annihilation rate than thermal wimps , and so this would lead to stronger cmb constraints from the additional energy injection .",

    "however , as discussed in @xcite , there are exceptions pointing to new directions for model building and a possible signature of the non - thermal period .",

    "we argued above that the transfer of these perturbations into dark matter and radiation can have interesting effects in some cases .",
    "but one can ask if the growth of moduli perturbations during the early matter domination can lead to interesting constraints ?",
    "in particular , it was realized many years ago that an early matter dominated ( dust ) phase could lead to a significant production of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) @xcite .",

    "a matter or moduli dominated phase differs in some important ways compared to the typical estimate of pbh formation in a thermal history .",
    "in particular , during a matter dominated phase there is no pressure to prevent the collapse of sub - horizon perturbations to evolving into black holes .",
    "this means that unlike the thermal case , perturbations can collapse to form pbhs long after crossing the hubble radius  the jean s radius vanishes and so there is no pressure to prevent collapse .",
    "however , in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) it was stressed that in a matter ( dust ) phase the resulting number of pbhs will depend on the probability for perfectly spherical collapse ( so that angular momentum does nt disrupt the process ) and the duration of the period . in @xcite this analysis was adapted to the case of moduli domination ( similar analysis with different motivation appeared in @xcite ) .",
    "one important consideration is that scalar fields on small scales can cease to be homogeneous and this can introduce a gradient pressure that prevents collapse @xcite .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that for the range of moduli masses of interest that this effect is negligible .",
    "it was also shown that the most relevant pbh constraint is requiring that pbh production does not exceed the critical density .",
    "given , a priori , the scalar tilt of the primordial power spectrum the corresponding constraints on the reheat temperature ( and so moduli mass ) were found in @xcite .",
    "there it was also shown that for a fixed duration of moduli domination and a specified reheat temperature ( both which follow from the moduli mass ) , constraints on the primordial scalar tilt @xmath286 can be established . for high scale inflationary reheating and @xmath287",
    "the constraint @xmath288 was found .",
    "however , given that at the time cmb modes excited the horizon ( @xmath289 e - foldings before the end of inflation ) the scalar tilt is constrained to be strictly red ( @xmath290 ) one can question the importance of this constraint .",
    "this implies that only in models where significant changes in @xmath286 result would one be able to place strong constraints on the reheat temperature .",
    "examples of such the blue spectra on small scales have appeared in the literature , for example in models of hybrid inflation ( see @xcite for a recent discussion of other possibilities and references ) . in summary ,",

    "places strong constraints on model building where isocurvature can be ruled out at the percent level @xcite .    in some cases non - thermal histories with moduli can lead to a departure from adiabaticity and significant isocurvature contributions .",
    "if the fields during inflation have masses comparable to ( or less than ) the hubble scale , the moduli can fluctuate and lead to a second source of cosmological perturbations  differing from the inflaton .",
    "this spectrum would be different than that of the inflaton ( and its decay products ) and so depending on the post - inflationary history this could lead to a large source of isocurvature perturbations at the time of recombination . for the histories with moduli we have considered in this review ,",
    "an analysis of isocurvature constraints and their importance for non - thermal histories was performed in @xcite ( for earlier studies see @xcite ) .",
    "to understand the possible origin of isocurvature in non - thermal histories consider the curvature perturbation associated with each type of fluid in the early universe ( e.g. radiation , dark matter , moduli , etc . ) .",
    "the curvature perturbation of the @xmath225th fluid is _",
    "i = --h . where @xmath375 is the newtonian potential and dots denote time derivatives , and @xmath376 is the density fluctuation of the @xmath225th fluid . in connecting with observations",
    "it is conventional to define the isocurvature contribution of a particular fluid relative to the radiation perturbation so that we define the ( gauge invariant ) isocurvature perturbation of the @xmath225th fluid by ( e.g. @xcite ) [ entropyr ] s_i = 3 ( _ i - _ r ) , where @xmath377 is the radiation density perturbation .",
    "observables are given by the correlation functions of these fluctuations or more conventionally by the power spectrum defined as = ( 2)^3 ^3(k - k)p_xy , for two fluctuations @xmath106 and @xmath231 .",
    "the observables for the isocurvature fraction , @xmath378 , its correlation with the curvature perturbation , @xmath379 , and the cross correlation between any two isocurvature modes , @xmath380 are given by @xmath381 which are all quantities that are constrained by observations @xcite .",
    "_ when do isocurvature perturbations arise in non - thermal histories ?",
    "_ if the mass of the modulus is lighter than the hubble scale @xmath382 during inflation , then the quasi - desitter period will result in long - wavelength fluctuations of the modulus field with an average amplitude @xmath383 .",
    "this leads to an additional source of cosmological perturbations with the corresponding curvature perturbation different from that of the inflaton . following inflationary reheating  where in a thermal history",
    "all of the energy and matter of the universe is assumed to be created  the modulus can decay leading to an additional source of radiation and matter . thus , whereas radiation and matter created during inflationary reheating will inherit the inflaton s fluctuation @xmath384 , those produced from moduli decay will instead be set by the modulus ( @xmath385 ) and so - may be non - zero leading to constraints .",
    "however , even though we have seen that moduli decay is an essential part of a non - thermal history , there are still many ways in which isocurvature perturbations may be observationally irrelevant and lead to no new constraints on model building .",
    "firstly , if the mass of the modulus is above the hubble scale during inflation @xmath386 , which may be argued to be generic @xcite , then in a single hubble time the amplitude of its fluctuations will be exponentially suppressed on large scales by a factor @xmath387 and so the inflaton will be the only relevant source of cosmological fluctuations @xcite .",
    "another important observation was made by weinberg , who demonstrated that even if an isocurvature mode is generated initially , if local thermal equilibrium is reached these modes will become adiabatic @xcite . and finally , if the modulus comes to dominate the energy density of the universe ( determining the cosmic expansion rate ) this also has the effect of washing out any existing isocurvature perturbations . in most cases",
    "studied thus far arising in string and m - theory negligible isocurvature results @xcite .",
    "we have seen that the presence of moduli in the early universe , along with susy breaking near the tev scale , motivate a non - thermal history .",
    "we discussed how this approach can account for cosmological dark matter , axions as a solution to the strong cp problem , and the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "however , we have also seen that in many cases existing data already puts very tight constraints on each of these .",
    "the most severe case is for standard susy wimps @xcite suggesting that more creative dark matter model building in the hidden sector may be necessary ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have also seen that a number of cosmological constraints  particularly those associated with the cmb and structure formation  can lead to rigid constraints on these scenarios .",
    "as data continues to improve at a rapid pace , this should help us continue to work toward unmasking the cosmological history of the post - inflationary universe and shape the direction for model building .    in most of this review",
    "we have emphasized the model independent aspects of non - thermal histories arising from moduli .",
    "this is possible because the prediction relies on the physics of the hidden sector .",
    "however , a particular challenge for string / m - theory approaches is embedding the visible sector .",
    "this is a challenging endeavor , requiring a model dependent approach , but we emphasize here that in cases where this is possible and quasi - realistic models can be constructed that the physics is largely independent of the hidden sector  a non - thermal history remains .",
    "other model dependent challenges do arise .",
    "the ` gravitino problem ' is a common example .",
    "gravitinos produced from the decaying modulus can lead to both dark matter and dark radiation production .",
    "this will depend on model dependent features , such as the branching ratio and the gravitino mass . whether this is a problem or not , depends on the model .",
    "for example , in the @xmath388 , the gravitino mass is comparable to the moduli mass and so the decay is kinetically forbidden @xcite .",
    "another challenging problem is the so - called ` over - shoot ' or ` kallosh - linde ' problem @xcite . as an example , in type iib ( kklt ) string compactifications , the height of the stabilization barrier is set by the gravitino mass .",
    "thus , if the hubble scale during inflation exceeds this barrier height the moduli can overshoot their minimum and de - compactify the extra dimensions .",
    "this problem is again model dependent and depends on the stabilization mechanism .",
    "for example , in models of ` strong moduli stabilization ' the problem can be avoided @xcite .",
    "a more model independent solution may result by having a dynamically changing gravitino mass as discussed in @xcite .",
    "model dependent obstructions like the overshoot and gravitino problems emphasize the need for further theoretical investigation .",
    "regardless , we have seen that a non - thermal history is a robust prediction of hidden sector physics in string / m - theory approaches to beyond the standard model physics .",

    "<S> we critically review the role of cosmological moduli in determining the post - inflationary history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> moduli are ubiquitous in string and m - theory constructions of beyond the standard model physics , where they parametrize the geometry of the compactification manifold . for those with masses determined by supersymmetry breaking this leads to their eventual decay slightly before big bang nucleosynthesis ( without spoiling its predictions ) . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a matter dominated phase shortly after inflation ends , which can influence baryon and dark matter genesis , as well as observations of the cosmic microwave background and the growth of large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> given progress within fundamental theory , and guidance from dark matter and collider experiments , non - thermal histories have emerged as a robust and theoretically well - motivated alternative to a strictly thermal one . </S>",
    "<S> we review this approach to the early universe and discuss both the theoretical challenges and the observational implications . </S>"
