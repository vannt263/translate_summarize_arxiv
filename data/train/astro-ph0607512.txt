    "the galaxy population both locally and out to @xmath9 is found to be effectively described as a combination of two distinct galaxy types : red , early  type galaxies lacking much star formation and blue , late  type galaxies with active star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are the morphology - density and color  density relations a result of environment  driven evolution , or were these trends imprinted upon the galaxy population during their epoch of formation ? only through comprehensive studies of galaxy properties and environments , both locally and at high redshift , will we be able to understand the role of local density in determining the star ",
    "formation histories and morphologies of galaxies .    while the close relationship between galaxy type and density was primarily uncovered via the study of nearby clusters , recent work using the 2degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , clusters include only a relatively small fraction of the total galaxy population at any epoch by number ( and an even smaller fraction by volume ) .",
    "thus , the evolution of the color  density relation among the vast majority of the galaxy population remains unprobed .",

    "it is critical for this paper that we characterize any systematic effects which alter the relationship between galaxy color and observed overdensity as a function of redshift .",
    "therefore , we employ a modified version of the @xcite mock catalogs which incorporate galaxy colors ; these catalogs are described in detail by @xcite .    to construct these new catalogs ,",

    "this produces mock catalogs which reproduce the observed relationships between galaxy color , luminosity , and environment in the deep2 data at @xmath78 , but do not allow those relationships to evolve with redshift unless the `` true '' distribution of galaxy overdensities evolves .",
    "after galaxy colors are assigned , apparent @xmath79 magnitudes are determined using the k  correction methods applied for deep2 @xcite , so that red galaxies will be lost at the same luminosity at a given redshift as in the data .",
    "we then apply the standard deep2 target  selection and slitmask  making procedures @xcite to these mock catalogs , so that we may directly determine the effects of deep2 target  selection algorithms on observed trends .",
    "these mock catalogs should not be a perfect representation of reality , as uncertainties in the observed environments will cause some objects to be assigned the color of a galaxy that is actually in a higher or lower  density environment than was measured ; however , this effect is small ( i.e. , environment measurement errors at @xmath80 are significantly smaller than the bin sizes ) .",
    "nevertheless , they provide a robust test of whether we may falsely observe an evolution in the relationship between galaxy color and environment when in fact none exists .",
    "they also allow us to directly explore what effects the increased errors in environment measurements at higher redshifts ( where samples grow dilute ) may have on our results .",
