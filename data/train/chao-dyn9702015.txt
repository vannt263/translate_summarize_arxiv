    "the specific model under study , is a 1-dimensional coupled map lattice of sine - circle maps with nearest neighbour diffusive symmetric normalized coupling ( also called future coupled laplacian coupling ) and periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "this is defined by the evolution equation    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the angular variable associated with the @xmath21th lattice site , at time @xmath22 and lies between @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the strength of the nonlinearity , @xmath26 is the period of the system for @xmath27 and @xmath18 which lies between 0 and 1 is the strength of the coupling parameter .",
    "we study the system for the homogeneous parameter case where @xmath26 and @xmath25 take the same value at each lattice site .",
    "however the framework we develop can be used to study inhomogenous systems where the values of @xmath26 and @xmath25 depend on the lattice site .",
    "we consider a lattice of @xmath1 sites and are interested in periodic solutions such that @xmath0 is the basic spatial period and @xmath7 is the number of copies of this basic spatial period .",
    "for example , in fig.1(a ) , we have a lattice of six lattice sites for which alternate lattice sites have the same value .",
    "hence it is a spatial period two solution and @xmath11 .",
    "this basic block is repeated three times so we have @xmath28 . in this paper",
    "we show how the stability analysis for a lattice of @xmath1 sites can be reduced to just the study of the basic period of the @xmath0 lattice site case .",
    "we show that to study the stability properties of a spatial period two solution in a lattice of six sites , instead of looking at the eigen - value of the full @xmath29 dimensional stability matrix it is sufficient to look at the largest eigenvalue arising out of the period two solution of a lattice of two sites i.e. the eigenvalue of a matrix of size @xmath30 .",
    "we begin with the simplest case which is @xmath27 , i.e. the coupled shift map case .",
    "this is just the linear version of the circle map and is a much simpler system to study than the full non - linear version @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 coupled shift maps with nearest neighbour diffusive symmetric coupling and periodic boundary conditions . as illustrated in fig.1(a ) ( where @xmath31 and @xmath28 ) , this is a lattice which can support a solution with basic spatial period @xmath0 and @xmath7 replica solutions .",
    "the evolution equations are @xmath32    we observe that for a spatial period @xmath0 solution , at any time @xmath22 , the value of the variable at the @xmath21th lattice site is the same as the value at the @xmath33th site .",
    "thus , the difference between the variable values of the @xmath21th and the @xmath33th lattice site , approaches zero for all such pairs of neighbours .    setting up the evolution equation for such a difference we have @xmath34    eq .",
    "3 can be completely expressed in terms of the differences @xmath35 defined as @xmath36 where the superscript @xmath0 denotes the spatial period at any time @xmath22 .",
    "the differences thus evolve as @xmath37 it can be easily seen that @xmath38 , is a spatial period @xmath0 solution for eq.5 .",
    "expanding upto the linear term about this solution leads to a stability matrix @xmath39 @xcite given by    @xmath40    this is a @xmath2 matrix , which is also circulant and whose eigen values maybe explicitly obtained analytically .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath39 are given by @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath1th root of unity given by + @xmath43 on simplifying , this can be written as + @xmath44    the stability condition for spatially periodic ( with period @xmath0 ) orbits of the coupled shift map is given by @xmath45 , the largest eigenvalue of eq .",
    "it can be easily seen that the largest eigen value is + 1 , indicating that the coupled shift map is marginally stable .",
    "this is true for all spatial periods @xmath0 , including the spatially synchronised case , @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "thus if we start off with initial conditions that correspond to a spatially periodic solution , we remain on them .",
    "the temporal period depends on the value of @xmath26 and we obtain temporally periodic orbits of period @xmath47 for rational values of @xmath48 and quasiperiodic orbits for irrational values of @xmath26 .      a similar analysis can be carried out for a lattice of sine circle maps of @xmath1 sites as defined in eq .",
    "we look for the regions of stability of spatially periodic solutions with spatial period @xmath0 for a lattice of @xmath1 sites .    as in the coupled shift map case , here",
    "too we observe that at time @xmath22 for a fixed @xmath26 and @xmath25 and a particular spatial period @xmath0 the difference between the @xmath21th and @xmath49th lattice sites is zero .",
    "the difference is again defined as @xmath50    using eq.1 and setting up the equation of evolution for the differences it can be easily seen that the evolution equation for these differences involves not just terms which involve the differences @xmath51 but also terms of the kind @xmath52 which is just the sum of the variables of the @xmath21th and @xmath53th site . we also observe that at a fixed @xmath26 and @xmath25 and spatial period @xmath0 that the sum of the @xmath21th and @xmath53th site is also a constant .",
    "so we now define @xmath54 @xmath55    using eq.1 we obtain the equations of evolution for @xmath51 and @xmath56 as @xmath57 and @xmath58    it can be easily shown that , @xmath59 , @xmath38 and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 mod @xmath0 ) , where @xmath62 are all distinct @xmath63 , are solutions of eq.12 and 13 for a fixed @xmath26 and @xmath25 .",
    "+ to study the stability of any spatially periodic solution with spatial period @xmath0 we need to examine the eigenvalues of the linear stability matrix .",
    "we expand eqs .",
    "12 and 13 about @xmath64 and @xmath65 distinct constants , upto the linear order and obtain the matrix of coefficients @xmath66 .",
    "( since we have two sets of equations namely for the @xmath51 s and @xmath56 s each for @xmath1 sites , the dimension of the matrix @xmath67 is @xmath68 ) .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of this matrix crossing 1 determines the edge of stability for the corresponding spatiotemporal solution .",
    "we have    @xmath69    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 where @xmath72 are given by    @xmath73    here , each @xmath74 and @xmath75 where @xmath56 repeats after @xmath0 sites .",
    "imposing the conditions @xmath38 and @xmath76 where @xmath77 , the stability matrix @xmath67 given by eq.14 reduces to a block diagonal form @xmath78 where the blocks @xmath79 are identical and each @xmath79 is of the form , @xmath80 and each @xmath81 where , each @xmath82 goes from @xmath83 and repeats after @xmath0 sites and @xmath84 .",
    "we thus obtain the stability matrix in a block diagonal form as given by eq .",
    "20 where each @xmath85 is a matrix of size @xmath2 .",
    "we now carry out matrix transformations which reduce the matrix @xmath85 which is a @xmath2 matrix into a block diagonal form with @xmath7 matrices each of size @xmath3 .",
    "thus a @xmath2 matrix is reduced to @xmath7 matrices each of size @xmath3 .",
    "further we use gerschgorin s theorem for eigen values of square matrices which reduces the stability analysis of the problem from the analysis of @xmath7 matrices of size @xmath3 to that of just one matrix of size @xmath3 - the basic spatial period @xmath0 matrix .",
    "we now illustrate the reduction of the matrix @xmath85 for a spatial period @xmath86 .",
    "the spatial period corresponding to @xmath46 is the synchronized solution where @xmath85 turns out to be a circulant matrix and has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 has special features which will be discussed in a separate section below .",
    "we consider the matrix @xmath85 of eq .",
    "21 where @xmath86 . using a similarity tranformation we now reduce the matrix @xmath79 which has dimensions @xmath2 into a block diagonal matrix of @xmath7 blocks each of size @xmath3 .",
    "the similarity transformation which achieves this , is a direct product of fourier matrices of size @xmath87 and @xmath3 .",
    "a fourier matrix @xmath88 ( where @xmath0 denotes the dimension of the matrix ) is defined as @xmath89 @xmath88 is easily calculated as the conjugate transpose of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the similarity transformation for a stability matrix of size @xmath2 , which achieves the block diagonal form is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 indicates direct product .",
    "for example , for a six lattice site case and a spatial period two solution , we have @xmath11 and @xmath28 , i.e",
    "we have three replicas of the spatial period two solution .",
    "constructing fourier matrices @xmath94 and @xmath95 we obtain ,    @xmath96    and @xmath97    a direct product of @xmath98 and @xmath94 will give us a @xmath29 matrix which is required for the similarity transformation for a lattice of 6 sites where the basic spatial period ( @xmath0 ) is 2 and the number of copies ( @xmath7 ) is 3 .",
    "since fourier matrices are also unitary the conjugate transpose of this matrix is also its inverse and so @xmath90 is the inverse of @xmath88 .",
    "the operation @xmath99 gives the following block diagonal form for @xmath85    @xmath100    where @xmath101 goes from @xmath102 .",
    "for @xmath86 , each @xmath103 is a @xmath3 matrix and has a structure of the form    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is defined as @xmath106 and @xmath107 is as defined in eq.22 .",
    "a similar block diagonal form will be achieved for the @xmath11 case as well but the matrix @xmath103 has a different form for @xmath11 which will be discussed later .",
    "we now use gerschgorin s theorem @xcite for square matrices which states that the eigen values of a matrix @xmath109 ( of dimension @xmath110 ) lie in the union of all points @xmath111 such that @xmath112 where @xmath113    where @xmath114 indicates that the summation is for @xmath115 excluding @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the @xmath118th element of the matrix @xmath119 .    by this theorem",
    "if one constructs circles in the complex plane for @xmath120 with the elements @xmath121 as centres and the sum of the absolute values of the remaining elements in the @xmath21th row as the corresponding radii , then each eigen value of @xmath119 must lie in or on one of the circles , the gerschgorin discs @xcite .",
    "we now consider a lattice of @xmath0 sites and the stability of a spatial period @xmath0 solution .",
    "we have only one block for a lattice of @xmath0 sites , and a spatial period @xmath0 solution , so @xmath122 in eq .",
    "27 and @xmath103 is given by @xmath123    where @xmath124 and @xmath125 .    the gerschgorin discs for this matrix will be @xmath0 circles of the following form .",
    "@xmath126 where @xmath127 .    thus according to gerschgorin s theorem",
    "all the characteristic or eigen values of this matrix will lie in or on these circles .    for a lattice of size @xmath1",
    ", we now construct circles for the matrix @xmath103 given by eq .",
    "the general form of matrix @xmath103 ( eq .",
    "28 ) differs from that in eq .",
    "31 in the form of the first row and the last row .",
    "so while considering the eigen values of @xmath103 we need to construct gerschgorin discs only for the first row and the last row , the remaining @xmath128 gerschgorin discs will be the same as those obtained for the @xmath0 lattice case above . for the @xmath103 matrix we have the following equation for the first gerschgorin disc latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } ( x_{1}-(1-\\epsilon)c_{1})^2 + y_{1}^{2 }   &",
    "= & ( | { \\epsilon \\over{2}}c_{2}| +    & = & ( | { \\epsilon \\over{2}}c_{2}| +     similarly the equation of the @xmath0th gerschgorin disc is given by @xmath130    @xmath131 is defined as @xmath106 . hence @xmath132 and @xmath133 is 1 .",
    "thus eqs.33 and 34 reduce to latexmath:[\\[(x_{1}-(1-\\epsilon)c_{1})^2 + y_{1}^{2 } = ( | { \\epsilon \\over{2}}c_{2 } | +    latexmath:[\\[(x_{k}-(1-\\epsilon)c_{k})^2 + y_{1}^{2 } = ( | { \\epsilon \\over{2}}c_{k-1}| +     so all the eigen values of the matrix @xmath103 will lie in or on one of these circles .",
    "thus the eigen values of all the @xmath7 matrices ( as @xmath101 : @xmath135 ) will lie in or on one of these gerschgorin circles .    but these are precisely the gerschgorin discs we obtained for the matrix @xmath136 i.e. the matrix for a lattice of @xmath0 sites and spatial period @xmath0 as obtained eq",
    "the stability of any spatially periodic solution is obtained by checking where the largest eigenvalue crosses the unit circle , with @xmath137 = @xmath138 being the condition for marginal stability .",
    "the analysis presented above shows that the bounds on the eigenvalues for the @xmath2 matrix given by eqs .",
    "32 , 35 and 36 for the @xmath1 lattice case are the same as the bounds on the eigenvalues for the @xmath139 matrix given by eqs .",
    "32 i.e. that of the @xmath0 lattice case which is also the basic spatial period .",
    "thus the largest eigenvalue for @xmath140 crosses 1 for the same parameter values as the largest eigenvalue of @xmath103 ( @xmath101 : @xmath141 ) crosses 1 .",
    "we thus conclude that it is sufficient to check for the largest eigenvalue of the basic @xmath3 matrix as given by eq.32 to decide the stability properties for any multiple of @xmath0 too namely @xmath1 .",
    "the bounds on the eigenvalue for a spatial period @xmath0 solution for a lattice of @xmath0 sites will remain the same for a spatial period @xmath0 solution and a lattice of @xmath1 sites .",
    "we now illustrate this explicitly for a spatial period 2 case and thus a @xmath142 case .",
    "consider the spatial period two case for two lattice sites which evolve via the evolution equations 12 and 13 .",
    "( see fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "here @xmath143 is the same as @xmath20    the stability matrix for a spatial period two solution is given by @xmath144 here @xmath145    it is clear from eq .",
    "[ two ] that the stability matrix for a spatial period @xmath11 , two lattice site case is not of the same form as that for @xmath86 .",
    "since each of the two sites has just one neighbour , each site is coupled to it s neighbour with a coupling constant of strength @xmath18 , and is coupled to itself with strength @xmath146 , in contrast with the @xmath86 case where each site has two neighbours and is coupled to each of it s neighbours with a coupling constant of strength @xmath147 and to itself with strength @xmath148 .",
    "the overall normalisation of the coupling in preserved in both cases .",

    "38 and that of eq .",
    "41 we find that the largest eigen value obtained for the @xmath142 lattice case is the same as that obtained for the 2 lattice case .",
