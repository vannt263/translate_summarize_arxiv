    "polarized millimeter / sub - millimeter emission has been observed in the disks around 3 young stellar objects : iras 16293 - 2422b @xcite , hl tau @xcite and l1527 @xcite .",
    "it is usually interpreted as coming from magnetically aligned dust grains ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this interpretation appears consistent with the data on iras 16293 - 2422b and l1527 , where the observed polarization patterns are broadly similar to those expected from grains aligned by a predominantly toroidal magnetic field ( @xcite ; see   [ sec : discussion ] for more discussion ) .",
    "in contrast , the polarization vectors in the disk of hl tau ( which is inclined with respect to the line of sight by @xmath5 , @xcite ) are all roughly parallel to the minor axis ( see fig.[fig : obs ] ) , which is not compatible with the pattern expected of grains aligned by a toroidal disk field , although more complicated field configurations can not be ruled out @xcite .",
    "another drawback of the toroidal field - aligned grain model is that it predicts a lower polarization fraction along the major axis than along the minor axis ( see * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , which is the opposite of what is observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obs ] ) .",
    "a much better fit is provided by a uni - directional magnetic field approximately ( within @xmath6 ) along the disk major axis .",
    "however , such a field configuration would be difficult to maintain against the disk differential rotation .",
    "furthermore , there is growing evidence for grain growth in protoplanetary disks , up to millimeter or even centimeter sizes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear whether such large grains would be aligned with respect to the magnetic field through the currently favored mechanism of radiative torque because their magnetic moments may not be large enough to provide the fast precession needed @xcite and their slow internal relaxation makes the alignment less efficient @xcite .",
    "these difficulties provide a motivation to investigate other potential mechanisms for producing , at least in part , the polarized mm emission from the hl tau disk .    ) , and polarization vectors ( @xmath7 ) , with length proportional to the polarization fraction . adapted from stephens et al .",

    "2015 ) is tilted by @xmath8 clockwise with respect to the vertical direction . , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    one possibility , first investigated in detail by @xcite ,",
    "is that the polarized millimeter disk emission comes from scattering of large dust grains .",
    "kataoka et al . stressed the need for anisotropic radiation field for this mechanism to work efficiently .",
    "as examples of this requirement , they considered radiation from structured disks with either an axisymmetric ring or a non - axisymmetric lobe , both viewed face - on . here , we extend @xcite s work to show that significant polarization is produced even in a smooth disk , as long as the disk axis is tilted away from the line of sight by a large enough angle",
    ". the physical reason can be understood most easily in the limits of optically and geometrically thin dust emission and rayleigh scattering , where the degree of polarization is peaked near a scattering angle of @xmath9 . in these limits ,",
    "the radiation field to be scattered by dust grains becomes essentially two dimensional , concentrated in the disk plane . in such a case , only the radiation propagating along the disk major axis would be scattered by @xmath9 to reach the observer and be maximally polarized , with a polarization direction along the minor axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "this simple geometric effect provides a natural explanation for the two main features of the polarization pattern observed in the hl tau disk ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : obs ] ) : ( 1 ) polarized emission concentrating in an elongated region more or less along the major axis , and ( 2 ) polarization vectors in this region roughly parallel to the minor axis .",
    "these are the features that are difficult to explain in the current models of polarization from magnetically aligned grains .",
    "they provide a strong motivation to explore in more detail the polarization pattern produced by dust scattering .",
    "it is a first step toward disentangling the contributions of dust scattering and grain alignment to the disk polarization , which is needed in order to take full advantage of the high resolution alma and jvla polarization observations that will become available soon for probing the grain growth and/or magnetic field in protoplanetary disks .    in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we will put the above qualitative picture on a more quantitative ground by computing the scattered radiation from an inclined disk ( such as the hl tau disk ) semi - analytically using the so - called `` thin - disk '' approximation that brings out the essential physics transparently (   [ sec : polarized ] ) ; a more complete treatment of the radiative transfer problem will be postponed to a future investigation .",
    "the effects of disk inclination on the polarization pattern will be emphasized .",
    "the scattered radiation is compared with the direct dust emission in   [",
    "sec : application ] , where the fractional polarization of the total intensity is computed . in   [ sec : implications ] , we comment on the implications of the polarization fraction observed in hl tau on the grain size distribution .",
    "we discuss the possibility of dust scattering - induced polarization for other sources and future model refinements in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] and conclude in   [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we develop a semi - analytic model for polarization from dust scattering under the simplifying assumptions that the dust emission is optically thin and that the dust disk is geometrically thin , with a local scale height much less than the radius .",
    "the latter would be a particularly good approximation if the relatively large grains responsible for the emission and scattering of millimeter radiation are settled toward the disk mid - plane . to isolate the polarization due to dust scattering from that caused by grain alignment , we further assume that the grains are not aligned , so that the radiation directly emitted by dust is unpolarized . under these assumptions , the incoming radiation field seen by the scattering dust grains at a given point inside the disk",
    "can be decomposed into two components : a local , roughly isotropic , component emitted by the ( non - aligned ) grains in a region of size comparable to the ( dust ) scale height surrounding the point , and an anisotropic component coming from the grains in the rest of the disk beyond the local region .",
    "the former does not lead to significant polarization after scattering because scattering of isotropic radiation by non - aligned grains does not have any preferred direction .",
    "it is the latter that is mainly responsible for the polarized radiation after scattering .",
    "the computation of this component will be drastically simplified by the thin - disk approximation , as we show below .      to facilitate the computation of the scattered light from dust grains at a location @xmath10 inside a disk with axis inclined by an angle @xmath0 with respect to the line of sight , we define two coordinate systems , both centered on the scatterer s location @xmath10 .",
    "the first is fixed in the observer s frame , with horizontal @xmath11- and vertical @xmath12- axes in the plane of the sky , and @xmath13-axis pointing toward the observer .",
    "the second is fixed on the disk , with the @xmath14-axis coinciding with the @xmath12-axis , and the @xmath15- and @xmath16-axis rotating around the @xmath12-axis counter - clockwise ( viewed along the minus @xmath12-axis ) from the @xmath13- and @xmath11-axis , respectively , by the inclination angle @xmath0 .",
    "we align the major axis of the disk in the plane of the sky along the @xmath14- ( and @xmath12- ) axis ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : illustration ] below for an illustration ) , and the disk normal direction along the @xmath15-axis .",

    "is expected to be more or less isotropic .",

    "the grains must have grown to tens of microns ( the exact value depends on the assumed grain size distribution and composition ) .",
    "however , this picture is complicated by the opacity spectral index @xmath187 inferred for hl tau , as we discuss next .",

    "another possibility is that the index @xmath187 is sensitive to not only the size but also the shape of the grains .",
    "indeed , @xcite was able to reproduce the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the disk of hd 142527 ( with @xmath191 in the millimeter regime ) with irregular grains of sizes up to only 2.5  @xmath193 ; the grain shape was treated with the distribution of hollow spheres @xcite .",
    "the grains inferred in our model of dust scattering - induced polarization for the hl tau disk have a significantly larger maximum size ( of order tens of microns ) .",

    "if large , mm / cm sized , grains are responsible for the relatively low value of @xmath187 observed in the hl tau disk , it is natural to ask whether they can produce a polarization pattern that matches the observed one through scattering .",
    "it is unlikely , because the key to producing the observed pattern is the polarization degree of the scattered light peaking near @xmath9 ( as in the rayleigh limit ) , and this requirement is not satisfied for mm / cm sized grains .",
    "for example , for the grain model adopted by @xcite , the polarization degree ( defined as the ratio of the two elements in the scattering matrix , @xmath195 , which is essentially the polarization fraction but can be either positive or negative ) is nearly zero at 0.87 mm for all scattering angles except around @xmath196 , where it reaches a ( negative ) `` peak '' value of @xmath197 for @xmath198  mm and 1  cm ( see the right panel of their fig .  2 ) .",
    "the negative value is known as the polarization reversal ( e.g. , @xcite ) which , together with the shift of the polarization `` peak '' away from @xmath9 , is expected to produce a polarization pattern very different from the rayleigh scattering case .    as an illustration",

    "[ fig : large_grain ] , we plot the distribution of the polarized intensity together with polarization vectors for the large grain case of @xmath200  mm .",
    "there are several features that are worth noting .",
    "first , unlike the rayleigh scattering case , the polarized intensity is no longer symmetric with respect to the major axis .",
    "this is because large , mm / cm sized , grains preferentially scatter light in the forward direction ( e.g. , @xcite ) , making the side of the disk closer to the observer ( the right half ) brighter .",
    "the polarization fraction is , however , higher on the far side ( especially toward the outer part of the disk ) because the polarization degree of the scattered light is higher for backward scattering than for forward scattering ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : preversal ] ) . the most striking difference between this case and the rayleigh scattering case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : final_map ] lies in the polarization direction .",
    "the difference comes from the polarization reversal in the large grain case , which yields an intrinsic ( or face - on ) polarization direction in the radial ( as opposed to azimuthal ) direction and an inclination - induced polarization along the major ( rather than minor ) axis .",
    "the interplay between the intrinsic and inclination - induced polarization leads to polarization directions in the region of high polarized intensity ( the most easily observable part ) completely different from those observed in hl tau ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : obs ] ) .",
    ", plotted are the polarized intensity ( color map ) and polarization vectors ( line segments , with length proportional to the polarization fraction ) .",
    "note the strong asymmetric with respect to the major axis in both the polarized intensity and the polarization vectors .",
    "the polarization along the major axis in the central region is due to polarization reversal , which may be a robust indicator of scattering by large , mm / cm - sized , grains .",
    "the near side of the disk is on the right .",
    ", scaledwidth=49.0% ]    we are therefore left with an interesting conundrum .",
    "the polarization pattern in the hl tau disk is suggestive of rayleigh scattering by relatively small dust grains ( although still much larger than the typical ism grains ) , but such grains may have difficulty reproducing the observed opacity spectral index @xmath187 ( @xmath206 ) .",
    "the index can be reproduced more easily with larger , mm / cm sized , grains , but it is difficult to generate the observed polarization pattern with such grains through scattering .",
    "it is conceivable that there are two populations of dust grains , with one responsible for polarization , the other for @xmath187 .",
    "the two populations do not have to be located co - spatially in the disk ; for example , large grains responsible for the bulk of the unpolarized continuum ( and thus @xmath187 ) may have settled close to the midplane , whereas smaller grains that dominate the polarized millimeter radiation may remain floating higher up above the midplane ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if this speculation turns out correct , polarized emission in millimeter would provide a powerful probe of not only grain growth , but also the expected vertical stratification of grain sizes , especially in conjunction with observations of optical / ir polarization , which probe even smaller , micron - sized , grains that are higher up still above the disk midplane .",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , spatially resolved polarized sub - mm / mm emission was observed in two other sources besides hl tau : iras 16293 - 2422b @xcite and l1527 @xcite , using sma and carma respectively .",
    "we discuss whether the polarization in these two sources is compatible with an origin in dust scattering .",
    "the l1527 disk is nearly edge - on , with an inclination angle @xmath207 .",
    "its 1.3 mm dust emission was observed to be polarized at @xmath208 level , with a direction roughly perpendicular to the disk ( i.e. , along the minor axis ) .",
    "this pattern is consistent with that expected from dust grains aligned by a predominantly toroidal magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is also the pattern expected of scattering by relatively small dust grains in the rayleigh limit because the polarization induced by disk inclination is along the minor axis ( as illustrated vividly in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] ) .",
    "indeed , the fraction of the scattered radiation that is polarized due to disk inclination increases with the inclination angle , reaching a maximum value of @xmath1 for edge - on disks , as we showed analytically in   [ sec : isotropic ] ( see eq .  ) .",
    "this trend makes it more likely for l1527-like disks to show scattering - induced polarization than face - on disks .",
    "indeed , the median polarization fraction of l1527 is the highest among the three sources with spatially resolved sub - mm / mm polarized emission so far . however , whether such polarization can actually be observed or not depends on the polarized intensity , which in turn depends on the total intensity and the polarization fraction ( relative to the total intensity ) .",
    "the latter is sensitive to the scattering opacity @xmath79 , which depends on the dust properties , especially the grain size , which can vary greatly from one source to another . to produce the observed polarization fraction of @xmath208 in l1527 through scattering",
    ", the grains must have grown well beyond @xmath193 size ; otherwise , the scattering opacity would be too small .",
    "the scattering can not be dominated by large , mm / cm sized grains either .",
    "such grains would produce polarization along , rather than perpendicular to , the edge - on disk because of polarization reversal ( see   [ subsec : larger_grains ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : preversal ] and [ fig : large_grain ] ) .",
    "large cm - sized grains are inferred in the l1527 disk from the small opacity spectral index @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "if the observed polarization is due to scattering by sub - mm sized grains , then two grain populations may again be needed , as in the hl tau case discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : larger_grains ] .",
    "the disk in iras 16293 - 2422b appears to be nearly face - on @xcite .",
    "its 0.88 mm emission was observed to be polarized at @xmath209 level , with the polarization directions showing a swirling pattern that is neither strictly radial nor purely azimuthal @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the pattern is broadly consistent with the polarized emission expected from grains aligned by a magnetic field that is warped into a spiral configuration by disk rotation , although the rotation is hard to measure directly because of the face - on orientation .",
    "it is inconsistent with the simplest dust scattering model for axisymmetric face - on disks , where the polarization directions are expected to be perfectly azimuthal , as illustrated in the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] . however , the observed polarized intensity is arc - shaped which , for face - on systems , requires intrinsically non - axisymmetric disk models , such as those constructed by @xcite .",
    "indeed , the observed intensity distribution is reminiscent of the lopsided ring models of @xcite ( see their fig .  6 and 7 ) , although the polarization direction in the models changes sharply from radial in the inner part of the ring to azimuthal in the outer part .",
    "it is conceivable that dust scattering models with more complicated disk structures , such as spiral arms , may match the observation better , but this remains to be demonstrated .",
    "one worry is that the dust emission in this source may be optically thick at sub - mm wavelengths @xcite , which would reduce the degree of anisotropy in the unpolarized radiation to be scattered , and thus the degree of polarization in the scattered radiation @xcite .",
    "another is that the polarized emission detected in this deeply embedded source may be contaminated by the protostellar envelope .",
    "higher resolution alma polarization observations should become available in the near future .",
    "they will provide more stringent tests of the dust scattering model of polarized mm / sub - mm emission .    as stressed by @xcite , polarized radiation at mm / sub - mm wavelengths",
    "provides a powerful probe of grain growth , if it is produced by dust scattering .",
    "a robust prediction of the scattering model is that large , mm / cm - sized , grains should produce millimeter polarization along the major axis of an inclined disk due to polarization reversal , especially in the central region where the intrinsic ( face - on ) polarization is expected to be weak and the observed polarization pattern is more easily dominated by that induced by disk inclination ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : large_grain ] for an illustration ) .",
    "this effect should be searched for with high resolution alma observations , especially in high - inclination systems .",
    "another way to probe large grains is to observe polarization at longer , centimeter , wavelengths using , for example , jvla and the future ska . at such wavelengths",
    ", the scattering by mm - sized grains would still be in the rayleigh regime , with a high degree of polarization of the scattered light .",
    "given the sensitive dependence of the scattering opacity @xmath79 ( which controls the polarization fraction of the total intensity ) on the grain size relative to the wavelength , it is important to carry out high - resolution polarization observations at multiple wavelengths to determine whether the polarization is indeed due to dust scattering and , if yes , to constrain the grain size distribution .",
    "with the polarization capability of jvla , and that of alma coming online soon , the prospect for using sub - mm / mm / cm polarization to probe grain properties in disks is bright on the observational side .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "much work remains to be done . in this paper , we have limited our treatment to the simplest case of optically and geometrically thin disk , to bring out the essential features of the disk inclination - induced polarization transparently through a semi - analytic model . as noted earlier , there is indication from the spatial distribution of the opacity spectral index @xmath187 that part of the hl tau disk is optically thick at sub - mm / mm wavelength , including the central continuum peak , b1 and b6 rings , at radii of @xmath210 , 20 , and 81  au , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the b6 ring is rather narrow , and the bulk of polarized emission is detected interior to it , it should not affect our hl tau model much .",
    "the continuum peak and b1 ring are not resolved by the polarization observation , but they can potentially lower the polarization fraction in the central pixel relative to the outer part , which is expected to bring the dust scattering model presented in   [ sec : application ] and fig .  [",
    "fig : final_map ] into closer agreement with observation .",
    "the effects of optically thick regions , as well as substructures on the disk such as rings and gaps , need to be quantified in future calculations in order to compare with higher resolution alma polarization observations that should become available soon .",
    "another future improvement is to relax the thin disk approximation .",
    "while the approximation is adequate for large grains that have settled close to the disk midplane , it would be less so for smaller grains that remain higher up above the midplane .",
    "it is likely that there is a gradient in dust grain concentration and size distribution in all three ( radial , vertical and azimuthal ) directions through grain growth , inward drift , vertical settling , and trapping ( see @xcite for a recent review , and @xcite for an example of gradient in grain size ) .",
    "such gradients should be taken into account in more complete models of scattering - induced polarization , perhaps using 3d radiative transfer codes such as radmc3d . as noted earlier , in hl tau and l1527 , the observed opacity spectral index @xmath187 and polarization pattern in millimeter ,",
    "if originating from dust scattering , appear to require two grain populations of different size distributions . whether they can arise naturally through grain evolution in the disk warrants further investigation .",
    "in addition , a complete model of disk polarization at sub - mm / mm / cm will need to include both the polarized emission by aligned , non - spherical grains ( particularly grains of tens of microns in size or larger , although it is unclear whether such grains can be aligned with respect to the magnetic field or not , as discussed in   [ sec : intro ] ) and dust scattering , and possible interplay between the two .",
    "motivated by the recent spatially resolved millimeter polarization observations of the hl tau disk , we have developed a simple semi - analytic model for the dust scattering - induced polarization in the limit of optically and geometrically thin disk and rayleigh scattering , with an emphasis on the effects of the disk inclination to the line of sight .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we developed an efficient approximate method for computing disk polarization from dust scattering by dividing the source region of the millimeter radiation to be scattered at a location inside the disk into two conceptually distinct parts : a near - field region centered on the location with a size comparable to the local dust scale - height , and a far - field region outside .",
    "radiation from the near - field region is more or less isotropic , and does not contribute significantly to the polarization of the scattered light .",
    "radiation from the far - field region is concentrated toward the disk plane .",
    "it is strongly polarized after scattering in an inclined disk .",
    "the polarization fraction of the scattered light increases with the inclination angle , reaching a maximum value of @xmath1 for edge - on disks if the incoming radiation to be scattered is azimuthally isotropic in the disk plane ( eq .  ) .",
    "the polarization induced by disk inclination is parallel to the minor axis .",
    "it can easily dominate the intrinsic polarization of the disk in the face - on view ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] ) .",
    "we developed a simple model for the polarization of the hl tau disk , based on the@xcite model of disk physical structure and polarization induced by a disk inclination of @xmath98 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : final_map ] ) .",
    "the model naturally reproduces two main features of hl tau : ( 1 ) the region of high polarized intensity is elongated along the major axis , and ( 2 ) the polarization vectors in this region are roughly parallel to the minor axis .",
    "both are the consequences of a simple geometric effect : only the radiation propagating along the major axis of a tilted disk would be scattered by 90@xmath211 to reach the observer and be maximally polarized , with a polarization direction along the minor axis in the plane of the sky .",
    "the broad agreement is robust because it does not depend on the detailed properties of dust grains ( which are uncertain ) as long as the scattering is in the rayleigh limit .",
    "it provides support for the millimeter polarization observed in this particular case originating at least in part from dust scattering , although polarized emission from magnetically aligned dust grains can not be ruled out , especially if the disk field is more complex than toroidal .",
    "\\3 . for the other two cases with observed mm / sub - mm polarization ,",
    "l1527 and iras 16293 - 2242b , the situation is less clear .",
    "the observed polarization pattern in the nearly edge - on disk of l1527 is compatible with that expected of either toroidal field - aligned grains or dust scattering .",
    "the pattern observed in the possibly face - on disk of iras 16293 - 2242b is more consistent with that expected of grains aligned by a rotationally warped magnetic field than with the simplest case of dust scattering .",
    "higher resolution observations of more disks with different inclination angles are needed to better differentiate the grain - alignment and dust - scattering models .",
    "the observational situation should improve drastically with alma and jvla .    \\4 . to reproduce",
    "the polarization fraction of @xmath3 observed at 1.3 mm in the hl tau disk , a maximum size of tens of microns is needed for the scattering grains .",
    "such grains are generally thought to be too small to produce an opacity spectral index @xmath187 of order 1 or less that is observed in hl tau and other sources ; larger , mm / cm sized grains may be needed .",
    "however , mm / cm sized grains tend to produce polarization parallel ( rather than orthogonal ) to the major axis due to polarization reversal ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : preversal ] and [ fig : large_grain ] ) , which is not observed in hl tau ; nevertheless , this pattern should be searched for in other sources as a robust indicator for large grains . in any case , the dust scattering model for polarization and the relatively low @xmath187 produce an interesting conundrum that needs to be resolved in the future , perhaps with more complete models that include grain evolution and 3d radiative transfer , as well as polarized direct emission from aligned grains .",
    "such models , together with the high resolution alma / jvla polarization observations that will soon become available , should make it possible to disentangle the contributions of grain alignment and dust scattering to the disk polarization , which is needed in order to provide robust constraints on the magnetic field that is generally thought to be crucial to the dynamics and evolution of protoplanetary disks and/or the grain growth that may eventually lead to planet formation .",
