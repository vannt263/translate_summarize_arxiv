    "might be limited in these reactions .",
    "this problem is addressed by recent calculations in constituent quark models  @xcite .",
    "a considerably large number of nucleon resonances are predicted by theoretical calculations compared with those observed in the pionic reactions .",
    "the nucleon resonances predicted but not yet found are referred as ` missing resonances ' .",
    "quark model studies suggest some of these missing resonances may couple to strange channels , such as @xmath18 and @xmath19 channels  @xcite . @xmath20 and @xmath21 hyperons have the isospins of 0 and 1 , respectively . accordingly , intermediate states of @xmath6 have the isospin @xmath22 ( @xmath12 only ) whereas intermediate states of @xmath23 can have both the isospins of @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "it is very interesting to study the @xmath25 and @xmath26 reactions to further our understanding of the role that nucleon resonances play in non - pionic reactions .",
    "measurements of the total cross section for the @xmath27 reaction at elsa / saphir  @xcite showed a new resonance - like structure around w=1900 mev ( @xmath28=1.5 gev ) , where w is the total energy in the center of momentum system .",
    "the resonance - like structure was theoretically studied by connecting with missing resonances , like the @xmath29(1900 ) , which were predicted to couple strongly to the @xmath18 channel  @xcite .",
    "these theoretical calculations were performed in a tree - level effective - lagrangian approach .",
    "the well - established resonances @xmath30(1650 ) , @xmath31(1710 ) and @xmath32(1720 ) in an s - channel and @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a t - channel were included  @xcite .",
    "there still remains some controversy in the theoretical description of the @xmath4 photoproduction , because of ambiguities from the choice of the resonances included , their meson - hadron couplings and form factors at hadronic vertices , and the treatment of the non - resonant background term .",
    "in particular , it has been found that the extracted resonance couplings are greatly influenced depending on which background model  @xcite is chosen .",
    "thus , caution is advised in drawing conclusions on possible resonance structures .",
    "it is important to measure additional observables and obtain accurate experimental data over a wide kinematical range for developing of theoretical models and for improving our knowledge of @xmath4 photoproduction .",
    "cross sections and recoil polarizations have been obtained at jlab / clas  @xcite and saphir  @xcite .",
    "the cross section measurements at clas  @xcite suggest that the resonance - like structure near 1900 mev has more than one component by examining yields at different @xmath4 scattering angles .",
    "recently , comprehensive measurements for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 reactions extending to @xmath35=2.6 gev at saphir have been reported  @xcite .",
    "in addition , measurements of the photon beam asymmetry  @xcite and the transferred polarization in kaon electroproduction  @xcite help to further define the @xmath4-photoproduction mechanism .    furthermore , to calculate the cross sections of hypernuclear electroproduction , it is helpful to know the precise cross sections of the elementary reaction of kaon photoproduction",
    ". therefore an improvement of the experimental data is also quite important from the view point of hypernuclear physics .",
    "the contribution of @xmath36-channel meson exchange is expected to become large at forward angles above the resonance region at @xmath372 gev .",
    "mesons exchanged in kaon photoproduction are @xmath9 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and higher - mass regge - poles .",
    "the dominance of unnatural parity exchange ( @xmath9- and @xmath34-exchanges ) leads to a photon beam asymmetry equal to @xmath38 while natural parity exchange ( @xmath33-exchange ) leads to a photon beam asymmetry equal to @xmath39 at the limit of @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "therefore , measurements of the photon beam asymmetries will provide information relevant to @xmath36-channel meson exchange .",

    "the data presented here is thus complementary to the clas data set . since there remains a significant discrepancy between the clas and saphir cross section data especially at forward angles  @xcite , new cross section data are important for solving this discrepancy .",

    "it is seen that the @xmath6 cross section increases at forward angles while the @xmath23 cross section decreases except for the low energy regions of @xmath64=1.947 and 2.029 gev .",
    "the experimental data for the @xmath6 and @xmath23 reactions are compared with mart and bennhold s model calculation in fig .",
    "[ crossangle2 ] . the dot - dashed , dashed and solid curves are the results of the regge model , the feynman diagram and the mixing model of the regge and the feynman , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the mixing model calculation agrees with the data for the @xmath6 reaction while the calculation of the feynman diagram only agrees with the data for the @xmath23 reaction .",
    "the calculations of the feynman diagram increase as the scattering angle becomes smaller , then they drop at cos@xmath740.85 for both reactions .",
    "the model calculation without inclusion of regge amplitudes can not explain the observed angular distributions for the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the regge model calculation shows steep increase for the @xmath6 while it drops for the @xmath23 at cos@xmath740.9 . in the regge model ,",
    "the @xmath9 exchange contribution is large for the @xmath6 but is small for the @xmath23 at forward angles . in the high energy data measured at @xmath75 gev at slac",
    ", the @xmath6 shows a forward peak but the @xmath23 does not  @xcite .",
    "this result was discussed in terms of the dominance of the @xmath9 exchange for the @xmath6  @xcite . in our data",
    "the same feature is seen at @xmath64=2.1 to 2.3 gev .",
    "the mixing model , which includes the regge model with a dominant @xmath9 exchange contribution , reproduces well the differential cross sections for the @xmath6 reaction .",
    "the photon beam asymmetries and differential cross sections for the @xmath25 and @xmath76 reactions have been measured at @xmath28=1.5@xmath422.4 gev and at 0.6@xmath59cos@xmath771 by using linearly polarized photons at the spring-8/leps facility .",
    "the photon beam asymmetry data for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 reactions have been obtained for the first time in this energy range .",
    "the sign of the photon beam asymmetry has been found to be positive .",
    "we obtained differential cross sections with good statistics at forward angles .",
    "the present data of the differential cross sections are consistent with those obtained by the clas collaboration in the overlapping region .",
    "the differences of these two data are within the expected error .",
    "the resonance structure at @xmath64=1.96 gev is seen in the @xmath78 reaction and this is expected to be the same structure as one found in the saphir and clas data .",
    "this bump structure can be explained by including a @xmath29(1900 ) resonance .",
    "a small enhancement has been found at @xmath64=2.05 gev in the @xmath79 reaction and the structure is partly reproduced by including the @xmath71 @xmath13 resonance .",
    "the differential cross sections for the @xmath25 reaction rise at forward angles while the cross sections for the @xmath79 reaction drop . this forward peak in the @xmath6 channel comes from the large contribution of @xmath9 exchange in the @xmath36-channel .",
    "our data indicate that @xmath9 exchange is dominant in the @xmath25 reaction , but not dominant in the @xmath26 reaction .",
    "we thank the staff at spring-8 for providing excellent experimental conditions during the long experiment .",
