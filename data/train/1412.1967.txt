    "in the standard hierarchical galaxy formation models , dwarf galaxies are the most numerous and elemental systems in the universe ; larger galaxies are formed from smaller objects like dwarf galaxies through major and/or minor mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , it is important to study these galaxies as the building blocks of normal bright galaxies to understand the formation and evolution of normal galaxies . in the local group",
    ", there are the following two types of dwarf galaxies : dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) and dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while dirrs are gas - rich systems and show current star formation activities , dsphs are gas - poor and consist of mainly old stellar systems .",
    "recent observations have unveiled the detailed star formation histories ( sfhs ) of dwarf galaxies in the local universe @xcite , revealing a significant diversity among the sfhs of dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of 60 nearby dwarf galaxies within 4  mpc from our galaxy using the _ hubble space telescope _ and estimated their sfhs through the cmds .",
    "they found that the majority of dwarf galaxies exhibits a long duration of sfh , consisting of both a dominant ancient star formation ( @xmath2  gyr ago ) and a lower level of star formation at intermediate times ( 110  gyr ago ) .",
    "they also found that the sfhs between dsphs and dirrs are generally indistinguishable over most of the cosmic time .",
    "they pointed out that there is a clear difference between them in the most recent @xmath3  gyr ; i.e. , dsphs show little star formation activity in this epoch , but dirrs do .",
    "the sfhs of galaxies also affects their chemical abundance .",
    "the stellar chemical abundance in some dsphs has been observationally investigated by using the 810  m class large telescopes with high- and/or medium - resolution optical spectrographs @xcite .",
    "the derived chemical abundance indicates that dsphs have fewer metal - rich stars than the milky way ( mw ) disk ; the average metallicity of stars in dsphs are @xmath4100 times lower than that of the mw disk stars .",
    "moreover , their chemical abundance show different trends from the mw halo , which suggests that dsphs have experienced different chemical evolution histories from that of the mw .",
    "the chemical evolution histories of the dsphs have also been investigated theoretically based on the numerical models @xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed that both gas outflow and infall are important to reproduce the observed chemical abundance and/or the metallicity distribution functions ( mdfs ) of dwarf galaxies ( @xcite , hereafter k11 ) . for dsph , a large gas outflow efficiency and lower star formation efficiency ( sfe ) than that of the mw have been predicted for their small metallicities ; the outflow rate per star formation rate ( sfr ) and the sfe of the mw are @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite measured chemical abundance of 2961 stars in eight dsphs , which provided a large and homogeneously analyzed sample of stellar spectra in dsphs . in order to extract sfhs of the dsphs from their observed data ,",
    "k11 constructed a detailed chemical evolution model including chemical yields from types  ia and ii supernovae ( sne  ia and sne  ii , respectively ) and from asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs ) as well as gas infall and outflow induced as sn wind .",
    "the model simultaneously reproduced the observed trends of @xmath7}$ ] , @xmath8}$ ] , and @xmath9}$ ] ratios with @xmath1}$ ] as well as mdfs in the dsphs .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the duration timescales of their derived sfhs were only @xmath3  gyr ( see table  3 in k11 ) , which are much shorter than those observationally estimated from the cmds in dsphs @xcite . moreover , although they stated that the derived star formation timescales were extremely sensitive to the minimum delay time of sn  ia , @xmath10 , they showed the resultant sfhs adopting two different values of @xmath10 only for a dsph among their eight dsphs in total ( see figure  10 in k11 ) .    in this paper , we construct a new analytic model of the chemical evolution of galaxies to reproduce both the observed sfhs and mdfs of dsphs , simultaneously .",
    "our model explicitly utilizes the sfh derived from observed cmd in dsph as the most fundamental input quantity .",
    "although this idea is similar to that proposed by @xcite and @xcite , they compared their results only with the observed chemical abundance ratios of stars in dsphs .",
    "since mdf is more sensitive to sfh than abundance ratio , we compare our model results with the observed mdfs in dsphs .",
    "while the abundance ratios are determined by the yields of chemically dominant stars at each epoch , mdf depends on both sfh and age - metallicity relation ( amr ) .",
    "therefore , if we find a consistent solution for both cmd and chemical property of a certain dsph , we obtain its mdf and amr simultaneously from our chemical evolution model based on its observationally estimated sfh .",
    "we also compare our model results for the @xmath7}$]@xmath1}$ ] relation to investigate the minimum delay time of sn  ia ; since the sn ia explodes with a delay time and ejects large amount of fe relative to the sn  ii , the @xmath7}$]@xmath1}$ ] relation suddenly changes when the sn  ia starts to explode .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of our chemical evolution model are described in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present the results of our model in comparison with observations .",
    "after some discussions including the comparison of our model results with k11 s one in section  [ sec : discussion ] , the summary of this paper is given in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "here we describe our new chemical evolution model to reproduce simultaneously both the observed sfhs and mdfs of the following four local dsphs , i.e. , fornax , sculptor , leo  ii , and sextans .",
    "we adopt the following assumptions in our model , which are the same as those in k11 except the items 2 , 6 , and 8 .    1 .",
    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) of a dsph is treated as one zone ; that is , we do not consider any spatial variations of gas density and metallicity in the ism at any time . 2 .",
    "the observed sfh derived from the analysis of cmd is used in our model .",
    "therefore , the sfr at time @xmath11 , @xmath12 , is fixed to the observed one .",
    "namely , our model is calculated along with the sfh.[assump : sfr ] 3 .",
    "we assume that there is a positive correlation between the gas mass and sfr like the schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite .",
    "since the sfr is given as input , the gas mass at a certain time is completely determined according to the sfr at the time.[assump : mgas ] 4 .",
    "the interstellar gas can be expelled from dsph ( i.e. , gas outflow ) while supplied from its outside ( i.e. , gas infall ) ; that is , the dsph in our model is not a closed - box.[assump : open ] 5 .",
    "gas outflow is assumed to be induced via a superwind ( a collective effect of a large number of sne ) , so that its rate is proportional to the total number of sne  ia and ii at each time",
    ". metallicity of the outflow gas is assumed to be the same as that of the system at that time.[assump : outflow ] 6 .",
    "the number of sn  ia is determined by the past sfh and the delay time distribution ( dtd ) function .",
    "the dtd function used in our model is the observationally derived one of @xcite .",
    "minimum delay time of sn  ia , @xmath10 , is adopted to be one of the model parameters.[assump : snia ] 7 .",
    "the number of sn  ii is determined by the past sfh and the stellar lifetime given by @xcite .",
    "we assume that stars with @xmath13 explode as sne  ii.[assump : snii ] 8 .",
    "gas infall rate is adjusted to reproduce the observed sfh . since we assume that the sfr is fixed ( item  [ assump : sfr ] ) and the gas mass of the ism correlates with the sfr ( item  [ assump : mgas ] ) , the gas mass at time @xmath11 , @xmath14 , is determined by the observed sfh .",
    "moreover , the time derivative of the gas mass , @xmath15 , depends on the sfr , the ejected gas mass from evolved stars ( i.e. , agbs , and sne  ia and ii ) , the gas outflow via a superwind ( item  [ assump : outflow ] ) , and the gas infall . therefore , in order to reproduce the gas mass , we set the gas infall rate as an adjustable amount ( see section  [ sec : infall ] ) .",
    "metallicity of the infall gas is assumed to be primordial.[assump : infall ] 9 .",
    "the yield of sne  ia and ii is adopted from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for the agb yields ,",
    "we adopt those of @xcite .",
    "we assume that all stars with @xmath16 @xmath17 evolve into agbs after their lifetimes .",
    "all heavy elements are assumed to stay in gas - phase during the entire time of calculation . 10 .",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) used in our model , @xmath18 , is that derived by @xcite with a mass range of @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "we calculate the chemical evolution for 119 elements and isotopes listed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite under the assumptions listed above .",
    "the equation of the mass evolution and the chemical evolution for an element @xmath21 at time @xmath11 are represented by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the gas - phase mass of an element @xmath21 in the ism at time @xmath11 , @xmath24 is the gas - phase mass fraction for the element to the total mass of interstellar gas ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the rate of gas mass for the element ejected from evolved stars to the ism and @xmath28 is its total ( @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are its infall and outflow rates , respectively .",
    "we assume that both the initial abundance of the ism and the infall gas are primordial ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xmath34 ) .",
    "the ejected gas mass @xmath27 is given by the sum of three independent terms as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 represent the rates of gas masses ejected from sn  ia @xcite , sn  ii @xcite , and agb @xcite , respectively .",
    "the term @xmath31 can be written by using the number of sne  ii and ia , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , as @xmath41 , \\label{eq - mout}\\\\     \\mathrm{where}\\quad \\dot{n}_\\mathrm{ia}(t ) & = & \\int^{t}_{0 } { \\it dtd}(t - t ' ) \\psi(t')\\ dt',\\\\     \\quad \\mathrm{and}\\quad \\dot{n}_\\mathrm{ii}(t ) & = & \\int^{100~m_\\odot}_{10~m_\\odot } \\psi(t - \\tau ( m ) ) \\phi(m)\\ dm \\label{eq - dotnii}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the outflow coefficient @xmath42 controls the outflow gas mass per unit sn . for the dtd function ,",
    "we adopt the following one , which are observationally estimated by @xcite : @xmath43 where @xmath44 indicates an elapsed time since the progenitor star of sn ia is formed . the variable @xmath45 in equation  ( [ eq - dotnii ] ) is the stellar lifetime of the star with mass of @xmath46 .",
    "the interval of each time step in our calculation is @xmath47  myr  myr .",
    "we confirm that this difference of @xmath48 does not affect the results significantly ( see appendix ) . ] .",
    "the calculation is terminated when the sfr reaches zero or a certain condition , which is described in detail in section  [ sec : likelihood ] , is satisfied .",
    "the assumptions adopted in our model listed above are the same as k11 except the assumptions for the sfh ( item  [ assump : sfr ] ) , minimum delay time of sn ia ( item  [ assump : snia ] ) , and gas infall rate ( item  [ assump : infall ] ) .",
    "it should be stated that , while the stellar lifetime adopted in our model @xcite is also different from that in k11 ( i.e. , @xcite ) , the difference is found to not affect the resultant chemical evolution . in the following subsections",
    ", we describe these major differences in the model assumptions between k11 and ours .      in our model",
    ", we use the sfhs estimated from the photometric observations for our sample dsphs ( i.e. , fornax , sculptor , leo  ii , and sextans ) as the most fundamental inputs . on the other hand , in k11 , sfh is not an input quantity but one of the output quantities , which is determined to reproduce the observed data of the mdf and abundance ratios for each one of their samples of the local dsphs including our sample dsphs . in figure  [ fig : sfh ] , we show the sfhs of our sample dsphs derived in literature ( fornax : @xcite , sculptor : @xcite , leo  ii : @xcite , sextans : @xcite ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the observed sfhs have much longer timescales of about 8 to 13  gyr than the timescales of the sfhs derived in k11 of @xmath491.3  gyr .",
    "it should be noted that the sfhs of both leo  ii and sextans start from 15  gyrs ago , which is longer than the age of the universe derived from the current cosmology @xcite . as for this discrepancy , @xcite mentioned that the current level of discrepancy is within the range of various plausible adjustments for the stellar models .",
    "however , for the safety , we have compared the best - fit parameters , whose details are described in section [ sec : likelihood ] , of sextans for the sfhs starting from 15  gyrs ago and 14  gyrs ago and we have confirmed that there is no difference .",
    "namely , the discrepancy is not critical to the chemical evolution of the dsphs .",
    "therefore we have decided to let it stand .",
    "for each dsph in our sample , we derive its sfr at each time step via linear interpolation of the discrete data points of its observed sfh .",
    "note that these observational estimates for sfh used here contain uncertainties , as shown in figure  [ fig : sfh ] , originated from the model which decodes the sfh of a dsph from its cmd , so - called `` cmd model '' .",
    "however , we do not incorporate such uncertainties in the process to obtain @xmath50 via linear interpolation ; therefore , sfh used in our calculation does not include uncertainties of the cmd model .",
    "we then calculate the gas - phase mass in the ism of the dsph at time @xmath11 , @xmath14 , as @xmath51^{1/\\alpha } , \\label{eq : mass}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same parameters in the k11 model .",
    "while k11 defined the unit of @xmath52 as @xmath54 , we set @xmath52 as the non - dimension parameter .",
    "this formulation explains the relation between total mass of interstellar gas @xmath14 and @xmath12 ( i.e. , @xmath55 , the generalization of a kennicutt - schmidt law ) . while k11 treated @xmath53 as one of their model parameters and found that its best - fit value varies among their sample of dsphs ( see table  2 in k11 ) , we fix it to unity in our model for simplicity .",
    "when @xmath56 , the parameter @xmath52 takes the same value of the sfe ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) in unit of @xmath58 .",
    "we investigate the effect of using a fixed @xmath53 on other model parameters through a comparison with the k11 model results in section  [ sec : k11 ] .",
    "we assume that sne  ia explode according to the past sfh and the adopted dtd function with the parameter which represents the minimum delay time for sn  ia , @xmath59 .",
    "these assumptions are the same as that of k11 except for the value of @xmath10 .",
    "k11 adopted a single value of @xmath60  gyr , while they concluded that the derived star formation timescale is extremely sensitive to @xmath59 ; larger @xmath59 results in longer star formation timescale .",
    "since the star formation timescale in our model is much longer than that derived in k11 , we adopt the following two values for the minimum delay time for sn  ia : @xmath60  gyr and 0.5  gyr",
    ".      while the gas infall rate at a certain time @xmath11 , @xmath61 , is represented by @xmath62 in k11 , where @xmath63 is one of their model parameters , it is determined in our model so that equation  ( [ eq : mass_evolution ] ) is satisfied at any time in calculation .",
    "this difference comes from the different assumption for the sfh described in section  [ subsubsec : sfh ] . in our model ,",
    "once the sfh of a certain dsph is given , @xmath64 at any @xmath11 is determined via equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) with an adopted parameter of @xmath52 and hence @xmath65 is also fixed .",
    "moreover , @xmath37 and @xmath38 in equation  ( [ eq - ei ] ) and @xmath66 in equation  ( [ eq - mout ] ) are completely determined because the stellar lifetime and both yields of sn  ii and agb used in our model are all fixed .",
    "the terms @xmath36 and @xmath67 in these equations also depend on sfh as well as one of the parameters in our model , @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , all variables in equation  ( [ eq : mass_evolution ] ) except for @xmath61 are determined for a given sfh and set of parameters in our model , that is , @xmath52 , @xmath68 , and @xmath59 . in more qualitative sense",
    ", our prescription for gas infall rate means that , while sn blows out a part of gas from the ism of dsph , star formation can take place according to the observed sfh so that the primordial gas flows into the system at the same time .",
    "nevertheless , the gas infall rate determined in this way would be negative when the time derivative of gas mass , @xmath65 , is negative and the outflow rate , @xmath69 , is low .",
    "such negative infall rate acts as outflow effectively .",
    "however , this implies that the system would blow out not only enriched gas by sne but also extra primordial gas simultaneously .",
    "this is against to one of the assumptions in our model that the system is chemically homogeneous . to avoid such physically unlike situation",
    ", we artificially add an extra outflow rate @xmath70 to equation  ( [ eq : mass_evolution ] ) so that the resulting infall rate becomes zero during such situation .",
    "therefore , the gas infall rate is determined via the following equation rather than equation  ( [ eq : mass_evolution ] ) : @xmath71 since the metallicity of outflow gas is assumed to be the same as that of the system at that time in our model , introducing such extra outflow gas solve the physically unlike situation described above .",
    "although the introduction of such extra outflow rate is completely artificial , it should be stated that external processes to remove gas from dsph such as tidal stripping can act as this extra outflow rate .",
    "this is because the outflow rate in our model is simply assumed to be linearly proportional to the sn rates as represented by equation  ( [ eq - mout ] ) .    as a consequence of introducing the extra outflow rate ,",
    "the net outflow rate ( @xmath72 ) is not proportional to the sn rate transiently when @xmath70 is not equal to zero . in order to evaluate the importance of the extra outflow rate quantitatively ,",
    "we define @xmath73 as the total mass ratio of the extra outflow to the net outflow in the entire sfh of a dsph , which can be represented by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the time at which our calculation ends ( see section  [ sec : likelihood ] for its detailed definition ) .",
    "if @xmath76 , there is no extra outflow gas required for the dsph during model calculation . if @xmath77 , the model needs extra gas outflow during model calculation .",
    "although this modification is artificial , the derived best - fit model parameters are consistent within their @xmath78 uncertainties whether or not this modification is adopted for our sample .",
    "the detailed definition of the best - fit model and @xmath78 uncertainties are described in next section and section  [ sec : best - fit ] , respectively .      in our model",
    ", there are three free parameters to fit the observed mdf as follows : sfe ( @xmath52 ) , outflow coefficient ( @xmath68 ) , and minimum delay time for sn  ia ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are determined through the following two steps .",
    "first , for each dsph in our sample , we calculate the evolution history of iron abundance , @xmath79}(t)$ ] , using the model provided with its sfh .",
    "when we calculate the abundance , we adopt the solar composition of @xcite for fe ; @xmath80 .",
    "the parameter ranges explored are @xmath81@xmath82 and @xmath83@xmath84 , equally spaced in logarithmic scale with a step of 0.01  dex . for @xmath10 , we examine the following two cases : @xmath85  gyr and 0.5  gyr . therefore , the total number of the parameter sets is 120,000 for each of @xmath10 .",
    "then , the best - fit model for each one of @xmath10 is individually determined by using a maximum likelihood estimation , which maximizes the following likelihood @xmath86 : @xmath87 } \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\qquad \\qquad \\times \\ \\frac{\\dot{m}_*(t)}{m_*}\\ dt,\\label{eq : likelihood }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88}_j$ ] and @xmath89}_j$ ] are the observed iron abundance and its uncertainty of the @xmath90th star in the dsph , respectively .",
    "the variable @xmath91 is evaluated in our model according to the sfh of the dsph , where @xmath92 is the stellar mass of the dsph at present and @xmath93 is the mass of the stars that are newly formed in the dsph at time @xmath11 and survive until the present .",
    "we note that , since both @xmath94 and @xmath95 are completely determined from the input sfh , the factor @xmath91 does not depend on our model parameters and simply acts as a weight in the likelihood calculation . therefore , the best - fit parameters can be different among our sample dsphs .    for the observed iron abundance of our sample dsphs",
    ", we use the data provided in @xcite , in which the iron abundance @xmath96 $ ] of nearly 3,000 stars in eight dsphs including our sample dsphs is spectroscopically measured by using fe  i absorption lines .",
    "it should be noted that these sample stars are different from those used to derive the sfhs . in general , the area in a dsph spectroscopically observed is different from that photometrically observed as shown in table  [ tab : size ] ; the area observed spectroscopically is typically smaller than that observed photometrically and concentrates on the center of each dsph .",
    "however , since we assume that the dsph in our model is chemically homogeneous at any time , we simply assume that the stars sampled in the photometric and spectroscopic observations both well represent the entire population in the dsph .",
    "we will discuss the influences of such difference in the observed area on the resultant chemical evolution histories in section  [ sec:4 - 2 ] .",

    "such violent change of metallicity happens just before the end of the sfh , where the mass of interstellar gas becomes very low and comparable with that of outflowing gas . in this condition ,",
    "small amount of yield is sufficient to change the metallicity of the interstellar gas , which is supplied via infall of gas with primordial composition .",
    "therefore , we set the following two criteria to determine the condition for the violent change of metallicity ; @xmath108 \\nonumber \\\\     & & \\qquad \\times \\ \\left[\\zeta_\\mathrm{fe}(t ) - \\zeta_\\mathrm{fe}(t + \\delta t)\\right ] < 0,\\\\     \\mathrm{or } & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "since the sn ia yields have smaller abundance ratio of @xmath0 $ ] than the sn  ii yields , @xmath0 $ ] of the system start to decrease when sn  ia starts to explode , that is , when the time of @xmath10 is elapsed since the onset of star formation .    through this comparison for our sample dsphs , it is found that @xmath60  gyr is too short to fit the observed distribution of the stars in the @xmath7}$]@xmath1}$ ] plane .",
    "however , this result is clearly against the observational estimates for the minimum delay time of sn  ia , which provides @xmath130  gyr almost certainly @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between our model prediction and the observational estimate to @xmath59 is discussed in section  [ subsec : discreptdelaymin ] .",
    "we show the time evolution of stellar mass @xmath131 and total mass of interstellar gas @xmath132 as well as the total mass of the system @xmath133 calculated from the best - fit models for our sample dsphs in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "note that , since the observed sfh is adopted as the input in our model , the time evolution of stellar mass is completely independent of model parameters ; therefore , both of the shapes and absolute values of @xmath131 for a dsph calculated from the best - fit models with @xmath60  gyr and 0.5  gyr are identical with each other .",
    "moreover , since gas mass at a given time is assumed to be linearly proportional to the sfr at the time , @xmath50 , according to equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) , the time evolution of gas mass for a certain dsph has exactly same shape as that of its sfr by definition .",
    "therefore , the shape of @xmath132 is independent of the model parameters as shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "however , the ratio of @xmath134 is controlled by one of the model parameters @xmath52 in the sense that smaller @xmath52 results in larger gas mass for a given sfr . for the dsphs for which @xmath52 of the best - fit models are very low ( i.e. , @xmath135 ) , that is , sculptor , leo  ii , and sextans with with @xmath85  gyr",
    ", gas mass dominates the total mass of the dsph in almost entire time during the calculation .",
    "the time evolution of the outflow and infall rates of the best - fit models are shown in figure  [ fig : flow ] .",
    "it is found that , while outflow rate evolves smoothly , the shape of the time evolution of infall rate is like a step function except for leo  ii .",
    "this step - function like shape of infall rate is originated from the prescription for infall rate in our model ; that is , the infall rate is adjusted to satisfy the condition of equation  ( [ eq : sec2 - 2 ] ) for a given sfh .",
    "thus , the infall rate can suddenly change at the time when the slope of sfr changes ( see figure  [ fig : sfh ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "such step - function like evolution of infall rate is rather artificial result caused by using the observationally estimated sfh with coarse time resolution . on the other hand , since the outflow rate is determined by the number of sn  ia and sn  ii as described in equation ( [ eq - mout ] ) and hence the sfr , the time evolution of outflow rate looks similar to the sfh and smoother than infall rate .    for the best - fit models for leo  ii with @xmath85  gyr and fornax with both @xmath10 ,",
    "bumps are also seen in the outflow rates at the late stages of evolution : that is , the look back time of @xmath36  gyr for leo  ii and @xmath136  gyr and @xmath137  gyr for fornax .",
    "these bumps are originated from the contributions of the extra outflow gas masses to avoid negative infall rate explained in section  [ sec : infall ] .",
    "the fractions of extra outflow gas masses @xmath138 of these models are @xmath139 4.4% , 0.54% , and 21% for the best - fit models for fornax with @xmath140 and 0.5  gyr and for leo  ii with @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "this artificial prescription for the extra outflow tends to appear in the late stages of evolution , where the increasing rate of metallicity of the system is smaller than that in the early stage as shown in figure  [ fig : amr ] .",
    "therefore , the effect of this extra gas outflow to the mdf is small .",
    "the gas flow rates of the models with lower @xmath52 are larger since the gas masses are larger .",
    "total outflow gas masses are @xmath4100 times larger than the present stellar masses .",
    "it is worth noting that the outflow and infall rates are comparable .",
    "this result implies that a large amount of infalling gas , which is comparable to outflowing gas associated with star formation , is inevitably required to reproduce both low average metallicity and relatively long sfh of dsph simultaneously .",
    "specifically , in order to explain the observed low metallicities of dsphs , a large amount of metals is required to be blown away by superwinds .",
    "however , since a large amount of gas outflow terminates the star formation in dsphs rapidly , a comparable gas infall is necessary to reproduce relatively long sfhs estimated observationally for dsphs .",
    "we will provide a discussion for the chemical evolution of dsph and comparison with the results of previous works in section  [ sec:4 - 4 ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : best - fit ] , we show that the observed mdfs of our sample dsphs are reasonably reproduced by our best - fit models . here",
    "we investigate the detailed dependence of mdf on our model parameters of @xmath52 , @xmath141 , and @xmath59 . considering that the mdf is roughly determined by the sfh and the amr as @xmath142 } } \\propto \\frac{d\\psi}{dt } \\bigg/ \\frac{d\\mathrm{[fe / h]}}{dt},\\ ] ] and that the sfh is fixed in our model",
    ", the mdf will depend only on the amr .",
    "therefore , through investigating the effects of the model parameters of @xmath52 , @xmath68 , and @xmath10 on the amr which are shown in figure  [ fig : amr_compare ] , we can examine their effects on the mdf .",
    "note that , while the illustrated models in figure  [ fig : amr_compare ] are only the cases for sculptor , the amrs for the other dsphs show the similar dependence on the model parameters .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : amr_compare ] , compared with the amr of the best - fit model with @xmath112  gyr ( black solid curve ) , the amr of the model with larger @xmath68 ( red dotted curve ) results in a slower metal evolution and its deviation from the best - fit model increases monotonically with time .",
    "this is because , for a given sfr , a larger @xmath68 leads to a more amount of metal elements expelled from the system as a more intense outflow , resulting in a smaller growth rate of metallicity .",
    "since the deviation from the best - fit model seems to be evident throughout the late stages of chemical evolution , @xmath68 affects the mean metallicity of the system ; larger @xmath68 leads to smaller mean metallicity .",
    "in fact , the best - fit models for our sample dsphs show this trend ( see table  [ tab : results ] and figure  [ fig : mdf ] ) .",
    "in other words , our model predicts that the observed low metallicities of dsphs are the consequence of intense gas outflows accompanied by large amount of metal .    on the other hand",
    ", the effect of changing @xmath10 from the value in the best - fit model of @xmath112  gyr into 0.2  gyr appears in the early phase of chemical evolution as shown by the blue dot - dashed curve in figure  [ fig : amr_compare ] .",
    "since the sn  ia supplies much abundant fe to ism compared to sn  ii and agb , metallicity of the system increases rapidly just after the sn  ia starts to explode ; that is , the minimum delay time @xmath59 is elapsed since the onset of star formation .",
    "therefore , the amrs with different @xmath59 are clearly different in the early stages of chemical evolution .",
    "however , the growth rate of metallicity decreases with time and hence the difference between the models with different @xmath10 becomes negligible in the late phases of chemical evolution .",
    "therefore , the effect of @xmath10 is important in the early phase of chemical evolution , in particular around @xmath143 .",
    "the effect of changing @xmath52 appears also in the early phase of chemical evolution as shown by the green dashed curve in figure  [ fig : amr_compare ] . since",
    "a higher @xmath52 means that the system has smaller gas mass for a given sfr according to equation  ( [ eq : mass ] ) , the interstellar gas of the system is easily enriched by the yields from the evolved stars , which are fixed from the past sfh . therefore , the model with a higher @xmath52 results in a more rapid chemical enrichment in the early phase .",
    "however , the growth rate of metallicity decreases with time similar to the model with changing @xmath10 . as a result , changing @xmath52 affects the metal evolution mainly in the early phase .    specifically , a lower @xmath52 results in a more number of metal - poor stars , producing a broader metal - poor tail in the mdf . in other words ,",
    "the dsph whose mdf has a broad metal - poor tail is expected to prefer a low @xmath52 .",
    "however , the best - fit parameters of @xmath52 show no relation with the broadness of the metal - poor tails in the mdfs against the expectation from our model ; while sculptor has a broader metal - poor tail than fornax and leo  ii , the best - fit parameter of @xmath52 for sculptor is similar to that for fornax and larger than that for leo  ii ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "this contradiction comes from the fact that the effect of @xmath52 on the metal - poor tail in mdf is not primary but secondary .",
    "the broadness of the metal - poor tail in mdf is primarily determined by the sfh , or more specifically , the fraction of the stars formed in early phase of chemical evolution . as shown in figure  [ fig : sfh ] , the fraction of the stars formed in early phase is large in sculptor but small in fornax and leo  ii .",
    "when we calculate the chemical evolution for fornax , sculptor , and leo  ii with same @xmath52 , the metal - poor tails in the resultant mdfs would be broader in sculptor and narrower in fornax and leo  ii .",
    "in other words , the value of @xmath52 is not determined only by the shape of the metal - poor tail in mdf but also by the shape of sfh .",
    "moreover , the similarity between the effects of changing @xmath10 and @xmath52 on amr leads to the degeneracy between these parameters in our chemical evolution model .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mdf ] and table  [ tab : results ] , the observed mdfs can be reproduced regardless of @xmath10 since the model mdf with short @xmath10 and low @xmath52 is similar to the model with long @xmath10 and high @xmath52 .",
    "this degeneracy can be resolved by comparing the model results with the observed @xmath7}$]@xmath1}$ ] diagrams simultaneously since different @xmath10 results in different abundance ratios of @xmath53 elements as described in section  [ subsec : param+errors ] .",
    "therefore , both the observed mdf and abundance ratio are required to determine @xmath10 and @xmath52 accurately .    in summary , it is difficult to understand the chemical evolution of dsphs only by analyzing the mdf and abundance ratio .",
    "it is important to examine mdf , abundance ratio , and sfh simultaneously for investigating the chemical evolution of dsphs .      as already stated in section  [ sec : likelihood ] , the observed area for a dsph in which its mdf is evaluated is typically different from that to obtain sfh . in our model ,",
    "the difference in the observed area is completely neglected since dsph is assumed to be chemically homogeneous . however , photometric observations for dsphs have reported that some dsphs have radial gradient with age and metallicity ; young stars are more concentrated than old stars and metal - rich stars are more concentrated than metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dsphs are not chemically homogeneous and the difference in the observed area for the sfh and mdf may affect our results .    in order to investigate the effect of this difference on the model results , we calculate the chemical evolution for fornax and sculptor by using their sfhs and mdfs evaluated from the stars in the same area , that is , the central region ( @xmath144 ) obtained by @xcite , where @xmath145 is the elliptical radius of the dsphs used in @xcite . as shown in figures  [ fig : fornax_inner ] and [ fig : sculptor_inner ] , while the number of metal - poor stars in the observed mdfs is slightly underestimated , our model can reproduce the observed mdfs for fornax and sculptor with almost same parameters except @xmath68 for fornax with @xmath85  gyr @xmath146 for fornax and sculptor are @xmath147 @xmath148 and @xmath149 @xmath150 , respectively .",

    "the @xmath153 upper limit of @xmath68 is @xmath154 = 3.02 $ ] @xmath155 with @xmath85  gyr @xmath146 . ] , which requires for a large amount of extra gas outflow ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) in the last several gyrs .",
    "we also calculate the chemical evolution for fornax by using the mdf evaluated from the 562 stars in a wide area ( @xmath157 ) of fornax @xcite , which is comparable with the observed area for sfh by @xcite .",
    "although the observed mdf in the wide area shows a more number of metal - poor stars than the mdf shown in figure  [ fig : mdf ] , our model can not reproduce it as shown in figure  [ fig : fornax_battaglia06 ] .",
    "moreover , a significant amount of extra outflow ( i.e. , @xmath156 ) is required for the last @xmath158  gyrs as shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : fornax_battaglia06 ] .",
    "the results of the above comparison indicate that our model for chemical evolution can not explain both the sfh and mdf simultaneously in the central and/or the whole regions of fornax .",
    "this difficulty can be relaxed if the sfe ( i.e. , @xmath52 with the units of @xmath159 ) is adopted to be time variant , which is suggested from observational studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the sfe controls the growth rate of metallicity in the early phase as described in section  [ sec:4 - 1 ] , the model with a time variable sfe can form a more number of metal - poor stars .    a multi - zone model is also expected to resolve the difficulty in our model for the number of metal - poor stars .",
    "some studies presented a signature of multi - component structure in dsphs .",
    "it is reasonable that the metal - poor population in a dsph has experienced different chemical evolution from the metal - rich population .",
    "hence , it is important to gather many observational results of dsphs and construct a more realistic multi - zone chemical evolution model .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : assumption ] , our model is basically the same as that of k11 . the best - fit parameters in k11 for our sample dsphs are listed in table  [ tab : cases ] . since the unit of @xmath52 in our model is different from that in the k11 model ( @xmath160 ) , we show a converted values of @xmath52 from @xmath160 in table  [ tab : cases ] by @xmath161 ) .",

    "although the best - fit @xmath52 is significantly different from that in k11 for fornax , the discrepancy of @xmath52 between the k11 and our model is attributed to the different prescription for gas infall rate . since the infall rate at @xmath204 is adopted to be exactly equal to zero in the k11 model , high @xmath52 results in rapid consumption of interstellar gas , terminating star formation in a very short timescale .",
    "since the best - fit sfh of fornax in the k11 model decreases rapidly in the first short epoch ( i.e. , @xmath205  gyr ) , @xmath52 is considered to be a maximum in their model . on the other hand , since the infall rate in our model",

    "the significant decrease of @xmath52 can be interpreted as follows . in order to reproduce a given mdf",
    ", a longer star formation timescale requires a slower chemical evolution , that is , a lower value of @xmath52 . as a consequence ,",
    "the case  4 model provides a set of the best - fit parameters which is quite similar to that of our model as shown in table  [ tab : cases ] .",
    "the tiny differences between the two sets of the best - fit parameters are caused by differences in the shapes of sfh .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the difference in the best - fit parameters of @xmath52 between the k11 and our model is originated from the difference in the star formation timescale for dsph .",
    "furthermore , although @xcite made their model fitting for the observed chemical abundance of sculptor and found that the @xmath206}$ ] is degenerated between the duration of the sfh and the sn feedback , our model fitting for the observed mdfs show no degeneracy between the duration of the sfhs and the @xmath207 ( see the cases 3 and 4 in table 3 ) .",
    "we emphasize that , since the parameters in chemical evolution model are sensitive not only to the mdf but also to the sfh , it is important to fit the mdf and sfh simultaneously in order to investigate the chemical evolution of dsph .      in section  [ subsec : param+errors ] , we show that our model disfavors the minimum delay time of @xmath208  gyr since it is too short to reproduce the observed distribution of the stars in our sample dsphs in the @xmath209$]@xmath96 $ ] plane ( see right panels of figure  [ fig : mdf ] ) .",
    "this is against the recent observational and/or theoretical estimates for @xmath10 , which show that @xmath210  gyr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the k11 model with @xmath60  gyr successfully reproduces the observed distributions in the @xmath209$]@xmath96 $ ] plane , it results in too short star formation timescales compared to those estimated observationally for the dsphs .",
    "therefore , to explain both of the sfh and the chemical abundance of dwarf galaxies simultaneously , a longer @xmath10 than the observationally favorable value of @xmath211  gyr seems to be required inevitably .",
    "what are the origins of this discrepancy in @xmath10 between our chemical evolution model and the observational and theoretical estimates ?",
    "one of the origins of this discrepancy can be the dependence of sn  ia rate on metallicity .",
    "taking account of the suggestion from some theoretical works that the sn  ia rate in metal - poor galaxies is smaller compared to metal - rich galaxies @xcite , we consider that the effect of the sn  ia yields on the abundance ratio of @xmath209 $ ] will be smaller in the early metal - poor stages of chemical evolution than in the late metal - rich stages .",
    "incorporating such metal - dependent sn  ia rate into our model with short @xmath10 will result in the same abundance ratios as the model with long @xmath10 because additional time is required to emerge the effects of sn  ia on abundance ratios since the onset time of the first sn  ia .",
    "therefore , the discrepancy can be relaxed if such metallicity dependence of sn  ia rate is taken into account .",
    "however , the opposite dependence on metallicity has also been suggested ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is still unclear how @xmath59 depends on the metallicity of the system",
    ".    another possible origin of this discrepancy can be the one - zone approximation adopted in our model ; it is an apparently oversimplified approximation for the dsphs because the age and metallicity gradients have been observed in them as described in section  [ sec:4 - 2 ] .",
    "if we adopt a multi - zone approximation instead of the one - zone one , the discrepancy can be relaxed .",
    "while the one - zone model sets the system chemically homogeneous , multi - zone models probably can describe these complicated structures . in the multi - zone approximation",
    ", zones can have different sfhs with each other and the ejecta of sn  ii and sn  ia can flow from a zone to another . if a zone has a short ( @xmath212  gyr ) star formation event and its star formation ceases before the sn  ia ejecta from near zones flows in the zone , the chemical abundance of stars formed there reflect only the sn  ii ejecta .",
    "in other words , the chemical evolution model with multi - zone approximation can increase the metallicity of the stars without the effect of sn  ia .",
    "the assumption of the time - independent imf is also one of the origins of the discrepancy , since some theoretical works predicted a different imf when the metallicity of the system is low .",
    "@xcite suggested that low - mass star formation was inhibited when the metallicity of the system was below a critical metallicity ( i.e. , @xmath213 ) .",
    "if the system forms only massive stars when the metallicity of the ism is low , the ism is chemically enriched without the contribution of sne  ia .",
    "therefore , the metallicity - dependent imf can relax the discrepancy about @xmath214 .",
    "some previous studies argue that dsphs have a bottom - heavy imf and/or lack very massive ( @xmath215 ) stars @xcite .",

    "therefore , the model with a bottom - heavy imf and @xmath85  gyr results in worse fitting to the observed data .",

    "the result of this comparison of the sfe is consistent with the observed result that the mean sfhs of the different morphological types of dwarf galaxies including dsph and dirr are indistinguishable with each other over most of cosmic time @xcite .",

    "it is indicated that , if dirrs finish up their all interstellar gas , they can evolve into dsphs @xcite .      as described in section  [ sec:3 - 2 ] , our best - fit parameter values of @xmath68 for our sample dsphs",

    "this amount of outflow gas mass is consistent with the physically possible maximum value , @xmath222 , estimated from the following simple consideration ; that is , the 100% of the sn energy is converted into the kinetic energy of outflow gas with a typical escape velocity of @xmath223 ( sculptor ; @xcite ) , resulting in @xmath224 or @xmath225 .",
    "nevertheless , this amount of outflow gas mass significantly depends on the assumption regarding the metallicity of outflow gas .",
    "the low metallicity of the dsphs is achieved not by the amount of gas outflow but by the amount of ejected metals .    in our best - fit models with @xmath85  gyr ( 0.5  gyr ) , the mass fractions of fe ejected from the system to the totally synthesized fe in the system",
    "are evaluated as 95% ( 91% ) , 99% ( 98% ) , 99% ( 98% ) , and 99% ( 99% ) for fornax , sculptor , leo  ii , and sextans , respectively ; that is , more than 90% of fe is lost from all of our sample dsphs as outflow powered by superwind , whose amount is consistent with those of @xcite .",
    "this high ejected mass fraction of fe is inevitably required to reproduce the observed low metallicities of the dsphs . in our model , 100% of the sn ejecta",
    "is assumed to be mixed instantaneously within the ism at once before gas outflow occurs ; the sn ejecta are diluted with the entire interstellar gas and the metallicity of outflow gas becomes significantly smaller than that of the sn yields .",
    "high resolution chemo - dynamical simulations suggest that only a low fraction of sn ejecta stays in the region where star forms @xcite .",
    "for example , according to the results from @xcite that the sn feedback efficiency of 0.030.05 is sufficient to reproduce the properties of the dsphs , the mass fraction of the sn ejecta mixing with the ism is estimated to be only @xmath226% . in this estimation , the total mass of outflow gas results in only @xmath211% of the final stellar masses for all of our sample dsphs",
    "therefore , the total mass of outflow gas can vary about 5 orders of magnitude according to the assumption of the metallicity of outflow gas .",
    "this result indicates that the ejected metal mass fraction of @xmath227% is more essential in the chemical evolution history of dsphs than the total mass of outflow gas .    in order to constrain the total mass of outflow gas ,",
    "it is important to evaluate what fraction of sn ejecta is directly expelled from the system .",
    "however , it is strikingly difficult to observe the outflow from dsphs since they have almost no gas at present .",
    "in contrast , the outflowing gas has been observed in dirrs @xcite . for the dirr starburst galaxy ngc  1569 , @xcite estimated the metal content of outflow gas by using _",
    "chandra _ and concluded that the outflow transports most of the metals synthesized by current starburst .",
    "if the dirrs are considered to be the progenitors of the dsphs as described in section  [ subsubsec : sfe ] , which still have plentiful gas and show ongoing star formation activity , these observational results imply that a significant fraction of sn ejecta is also directly expelled from dsphs .",
    "therefore , the total masses of outflow gas of dsphs seem to be smaller than their current stellar masses .",
    "we have constructed a new analytic model for the chemical evolution to reproduce both the observed sfh and mdf of a dsph , simultaneously .",
    "while the prescriptions and assumptions in our model are similar to those adopted in k11 , there are critical differences between them as described in section  [ sec : assumption ] : that is , the assumptions for the sfh , the minimum delay time for sn  ia , and infalling gas . with this new model",
    ", we have performed model calculations for fornax , sculptor , leo  ii , and sextans , and compare the derived mdfs with observed mdfs .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "it is demonstrated that our new models can reproduce the observed mdfs of the dsphs with various metallicity .",
    "we have found that their mdfs are characterized by two parameters : the sfe ( @xmath52 ) and the gas outflow efficiency ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is shown that the likelihoods of the best - fit models for the dsphs do not depend on the minimum delay time of sn  ia ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this means that any constraints are not obtained by analyzing both the mdfs and the sfhs .",
    "we have found that the best - fit models with @xmath85  gyr underestimate the observed @xmath7}$ ] of the dsphs , while previous studies have suggested @xmath228 . in our models",
    ", @xmath10 is required to be much longer than @xmath229  gyr to explain the observed sfhs , mdfs , and @xmath7}$ ] , simultaneously .",
    "3 .   the derived sfes of the dsphs are lower than that estimated observationally for the mw ( @xmath230 ) and those obtained theoretically for the dsphs by k11 .",
    "these low sfes lead to small growth rate of metallicity and broad metal - poor tail in the mdf .",
    "the best - fit values of sfe are similar to those evaluated observationally for dirrs with both rich gas and star formation activity .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of dwarf galaxies that the mean sfhs of the dsphs and dirrs are indistinguishable with each other over most of cosmic time .",
    "the derived @xmath68 ( the outflow gas mass per unit sn ) are similar to those obtained theoretically for the dsphs by k11 and the outflow rate per sfr are larger than that estimated observationally for the mw ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the large amount of gas outflow leads to large amount of metal outflow and lower mean metallicity of the dsph .",
    "our model predicts that the dsphs have lost more than 90% of iron synthesized in the systems ; this is consistent with observational results that there is outflowing gas in some dirrs like ngc  1569 .",
    "the derived gas infall rates are comparable to the derived gas outflow rates .",
    "since the dsphs have low metallicities and relatively long sfhs , our model needs large amount of metal outflows and as well as comparable amount of gas infalls to maintain the star formations as observed .",
