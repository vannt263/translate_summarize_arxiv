    "<S> we study the gutzwiller method for the spinless fermion model in one dimension , which is one of the simplest models that incorporates the intersite coulomb interaction . </S>",

    "<S> we obtain the gutzwiller solution of the problem by a careful enumeration of the many - particle configurations and explain the origin of the discrepancy in the literature to be due to the neglect of the correlation between the neighboring bond occupancies . </S>",
    "<S> the correct implementation of the gutzwiller approach yields results different from the slave - boson mean - field theory , unlike for the hubbard model with on - site interaction , where both methods are known to be equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the slave - boson and the gutzwiller results are compared to the exact solution , available for the half - filled case , and to the numerical exact diagonalization results for the case of general filling .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction _  conventional many - body theory has difficulty in taking into account the local correlations while , at the same time , preserving the itinerant character of the many - electron states . because of this </S>",
    "<S> , there has been a resurgence of interest in the variational gutzwiller method,@xcite where local correlations show up as a renormalization of the kinetic energy@xcite within the gutzwiller approximation and the overall itinerant character of the electrons is preserved . </S>",
    "<S> the method leads to a many - body modification of the fermi surfaces and is being increasingly used to describe the measured fermi surface topology of correlated systems starting from materials as simple as ni@xcite to more complex systems such as nacoo@xmath0@xcite and laofeas@xcite using model hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn has led to a flurry of work for incorporating the gutzwiller approach in the density - functional theory for realistic solids.@xcite    while the gutzwiller method has been well developed for on - site coulomb interactions , it has been less studied when the inter - site coulomb interactions are present . on the other hand , the nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction is an important ingredient in models used to describe the charge order - disorder transition in many systems such as the verwey transition in the half - metallic fe@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus there is a need to develop the gutzwiller approach for incorporating the effects of the inter - site coulomb interactions , which presents nuances not encounterd in treating models with on - site coulomb interactions such as the hubbard model .    the simplest model that contains the intersite coulomb interaction is the spinless fermion model in one dimension ( 1d ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 creates a spinless fermion at the site @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and the summation is taken over distinct pairs of nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> the is also an important model due to its equivalence to the xxz heisenberg model via the jordan - wigner transformation.@xcite the gutzwiller approach for this model has been treated by three different papers in the literature@xcite including two by the same author ; however the results differ from one another including the all - important gutzwiller reduction factor for the kinetic energy . in this paper , we study this model with the gutzwiller approach by a careful enumeration of the many - particle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree with one@xcite of the two papers of fazekas , while we find that the reason for disagreement with the third paper@xcite is their neglect of the correlation between the states of the nearest - neighbor bonds in counting the many - particle configurations . </S>",
    "<S> this omission of the correlation , both in the gutzwiller as well as in the slave - boson mean - field methods , effectively turns the bond problem into the site problem,@xcite yielding results for the 1d spinless fermion model very similar to the 1d hubbard model .    </S>",

    "<S> the essential complication here is that while the site occupancies in the hubbard model are specified independently of one another , the bond occupancies are correlated between nearest - neighbor bonds , making the combinatorial problem significantly more involved . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as already mentioned . since we evaluate the reduction factor for the equal - weight state ( [ psi - equal ] ) exactly and we also use the same state in the gutzwiller variational wave function ( [ gutz ] ) throughout this paper , our results remain fully variational . </S>",

    "<S> [ eperelectron ] , the correlation energy , as expected , is the largest at half filling , reducing gradually to zero for @xmath60 or 1 . the energy for the uncorrelated state was obtained by evaluating the kinetic energy for the state @xmath61 , which is simply @xmath62 , and adding to it the interaction energy @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the bond occupancy for the uncorrelated state . </S>",

    "<S> however , this need not be considered surprising since the equal - weight uncorrelated wave function @xmath78 , used to obtain the reduction factor @xmath17 , does not necessarily have the lowest kinetic energy , even for the case of @xmath75 . therefore the gutzwiller variational method tries to produce a better ground state and ground - state energy within the variational degree of freedom it is given . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of the correlated state could therefore in principle be larger than the uncorrelated trial state with the kinetic energy reduction factor exceeding one as is the case here .    </S>",
