    "the notion of functional integral plays a central role in quantum field theory , but it has defied attempts at a rigorous mathematical formulation , except in some special cases ( typically in space - time dimension 2 ) .",
    "topological field theory ( tft ) provides a useful playground for studying properties of the functional integral in a simplified setting and has been the subject of many works since the pioneering papers by e.  witten @xcite .",
    "the physical definition of the functional integral uses an ill - defined measure on the space of field configurations , but one can use the usual mathematical ploy and try to axiomatize properties of the functional integral without making a direct reference to this measure .",
    "the first attempt at such an axiomatization was made by m.  atiyah @xcite .",
    "atiyah defines a tft in @xmath0-dimensions as a functor @xmath2 from a certain geometrically defined category @xmath3 to the category of complex vector spaces @xmath4 ( or to the category of @xmath5-graded complex vector spaces @xmath6 ) .",
    "the category @xmath3 has as its objects compact oriented @xmath7-manifolds without boundary and has as its morphisms oriented bordisms between such manifolds .",
    "@xmath2 is supposed to be invariant with respect to diffeomorphisms .",
    "the disjoint union gives the category @xmath3 a symmetric monoidal structure whose identity object is the empty @xmath7-manifold .",
    "the category @xmath4 also has a natural symmetric monoidal structure given by the tensor product ; the identity object is the field @xmath8 . the functor @xmath2 is required to be monoidal ; in particular , it sends the disjoint union of two @xmath7-manifolds @xmath9 and @xmath10 to the tensor product @xmath11 , and it sends the empty manifold to @xmath8 .",
    "since we can regard a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath12 as a bordism between @xmath13 and @xmath13 , the functor @xmath2 sends any such @xmath12 to a linear map from @xmath8 to @xmath8 , i.e. a complex number @xmath14 .",
    "this number is called the partition function of the tft on the manifolds @xmath12 .",
    "so we see that an @xmath0-dimensional tft assigns a number to a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold and a vector space to a closed oriented @xmath7-manifold .",
    "it is natural to ask if an @xmath0-dimensional tft assigns anything to closed oriented manifolds of lower dimensions .",
    "an obvious guess is that it assigns a @xmath8-linear category to an @xmath15-manifold , a @xmath8-linear 2-category to an @xmath16-manifold , etc .",
    "the resulting gadget is usually called an _ extended topological field theory_.-categories whose theory is being developed by j. lurie @xcite is even better suited for tft applications @xcite .",
    "its physical significance remains unclear at the time of writiing .",
    "] extending the tft functor to lower - dimensional manifolds is natural if we consider gluing closed manifolds out of manifolds with boundaries .",
    "for example , given two oriented @xmath7-dimensional manifolds @xmath17 and @xmath18 and an orientation - reversing diffeomorphism @xmath19 , we can glue @xmath17 and @xmath18 along their common boundary and get a closed oriented @xmath7-manifold @xmath20 . an extended tft in @xmath0-dimensions assigns to @xmath21 a @xmath8-linear category @xmath22 and assigns to @xmath17 and @xmath23 ( the orientation - reversal of @xmath18 ) objects @xmath24 and @xmath25 of this category . the fact that @xmath20 can be glued from @xmath17 and @xmath18 means that the vector space @xmath26 is the space of morphisms from the object @xmath24 to the object @xmath25 .",
    "while the relevance of higher categories for tft in higher dimensions has been recognized by experts for some time @xcite , an axiomatic definition of an extended tft has not been formulated for an obvious reason : the lack of a universally accepted definition of an @xmath0-category for @xmath27.-categories .",
    "while the former are easily defined , they almost never occur in practice ; to define extended tfts one needs weak @xmath0-categories . ]",
    "this technical obstacle was compounded by a lack of understanding of the physical meaning of higher categories .    the correct definition of a weak @xmath0-category being non - obvious , one is forced to go back to the physical roots of the subject .",
    "we will first discuss two - dimensional tfts which have been studied extensively because of their connection with mirror symmetry and explain why boundary conditions in a 2d tft form a category .",
    "this observation is due to m.  douglas @xcite .",
    "then we will move on to three dimensions and explain why boundary conditions in a 3d tft form a 2-category . applying these observations to @xmath0-dimensional tft",
    "we will be able to see from a more physical viewpoint why @xmath0-dimensional tft assigns a @xmath8-linear @xmath28-category to a compact oriented @xmath29-manifold .",
    "then we will describe two examples of tfts in three and four dimensions and their applications to two different mathematical problems : the classification of monoidal deformations of the derived category of coherent sheaves and the geometric langlands program .",
    "consider a 2d tft on a compact oriented 2-manifold @xmath30 with a nonempty boundary .",
    "it turns out necessary to impose some conditions on the values of the fields on @xmath31 for the functional integral to be well - defined on the physical level of rigor . roughly speaking",
    ", these conditions must define a lagrangian submanifold in the space of boundary values of the fields , where the symplectic form arises from the boundary terms in the variation of the action . on the classical level ,",
    "boundary conditions are needed to make the initial - value problem for the classical equations of motion to be well - posed and to ensure the existence of a symplectic form on the space of solutions .",
    "boundary conditions in a 2d tft ( also known as branes ) form a @xmath8-linear category .",
    "this is the category which the 2d tft assigns to a point .",
    "morphisms in this category are _ boundary - changing local operators_. to explain informally what this means , suppose @xmath30 is a half - plane @xmath32 , and one imposed a boundary condition @xmath33 on the half - line @xmath34 and a boundary condition @xmath35 on the half - line @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . at the special point @xmath37",
    "additional data are needed to specify the functional integral uniquely .",
    "these data define a boundary - changing point operator @xmath38 between @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "[ fig1 ]     it is a basic physical principle that the set of boundary - changing point operators has the structure of a ( graded ) vector space . to see why ,",

    "( unlike the boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath35 the boundary condition corresponding to a boundary - changing point operator is nonlocal , in general , in the sense that it does not merely constrain the values of the fields and a finite number of their derivatives along the boundary but may involve constraints on the fourier components of the restrictions of the fields to the boundary . ) the key remark is that the half - plane with a half - disc removed is diffeomorphic to a product of a half - line parameterized by @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the interval @xmath48 $ ] parameterized by @xmath49 .",
    "we now reinterpret @xmath46 as the time coordinate and @xmath49 as the spatial coordinate . on the spatial boundaries",
    "@xmath50 we have boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath35 , while the boundary condition at @xmath45 is now regarded as an initial condition .",
    "initial states in any quantum theory form a vector space ( in fact , a hilbert space ) .",
    "we conclude that boundary - changing point operators between boundary conditions @xmath33 and @xmath35 form a vector space @xmath51 .",
    "is not the same as @xmath52 . ]",
    "[ fig2 ]",
    "next we consider a situation where @xmath30 is a half - plane , but its boundary is divided into three pieces : a half - line @xmath53 , an interval @xmath54 , and a half - line @xmath55 .",
    "we impose boundary conditions @xmath56 on the three pieces respectively , so we need two boundary - changing point operators which are elements of vector spaces @xmath51 and @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in a tft",
    "the limit @xmath58 always exists , and one should be able to interpret these two boundary - changing point operators as a single boundary - changing point operator between @xmath33 and @xmath59 , i.e. an element of the vector space @xmath60 .",
    "this gives a ` fusion product' @xmath61 one may further argue that this product is bilinear and associative in an obvious sense .",
    "note also that for any @xmath33 the vector space @xmath62 has a special element : the boundary - changing point operators which is trivial .",
    "this element serves as a unit in the algebra @xmath62 .",
    "altogether we obtain a category whose objects are branes , whose morphisms are elements of vector spaces @xmath51 , and with the composition of morphisms defined by means of the fusion product .    [ fig3 ]     axioms of 2d tft",
    "as usually formulated further imply that the resulting category is self - dual , in the sense that the spaces @xmath51 and @xmath52 are naturally dual , but we will not emphasize this aspect , since in some cases with infinite - dimensional spaces @xmath51 this requirement is not satisfied .",
    "the last remark we want to make about extended tfts in two dimensions is that instead of closed oriented manifolds one may consider compact oriented manifolds with a nonempty boundary .",
    "the connected components of the boundary should be labeled by objects of the category of branes .",
    "we will call this labeling a decoration of a manifold .",
    "extended tft assigns a complex number to a decorated 2-manifold ( the value of the functional integral with the corresponding boundary conditions ) .",
    "it assigns a vector space to a decorated 1-manifold .",
    "the only connected decorated 1-manifold is an interval , whose decoration consists of an ordered pair @xmath63 of branes .",
    "the vector space assigned to such a pair is the space of boundary - changing local operators @xmath51 introduced above . a good way to think about",
    "this rule is the following : if we consider our 2d tft on a 2-manifold of the form @xmath64 $ ] , where the two connected components of the boundary are labeled by @xmath33 and @xmath35 , then we may regard it as a 1d tft on @xmath65 ( this is called kaluza - klein reduction ) .",
    "a 1d tft is simply a quantum mechanical system , and its hilbert space of states is what we assign to the interval @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "three - dimensional tft is supposed to assigns a @xmath8-linear category to a closed oriented 1-manifold and a @xmath8-linear 2-category to a point .",
    "let us first explain the physical meaning of the former .",
    "consider a 3d tft on a manifold of the form @xmath67 , where @xmath30 is an oriented 2-manifold which may be noncompact or have a nonempty boundary .",
    "another basic physical principle ( kaluza - klein reduction ) is that in such a case one can describe the physics of the compactified theory by an _",
    "effective 2d tft _ on @xmath30 . by definition ,",
    "the category assigned to a circle is the category of branes in this effective 2d tft .",
    "the 2-category assigned to a point is the 2-category of boundary conditions in the 3d tft . to explain where the 2-category structure comes from , consider a 3d tft on an oriented 3-manifold @xmath68 with a nonempty boundary ,",
    "imagine that a connected component of @xmath69 is subdivided by closed curves into domains , and that one imposed unrelated boundary conditions on different domains .",
    "each domain is thus labeled by an element of the set of boundary conditions .",
    "a closed curve separating the domains labeled by boundary conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 is itself labeled by an element of a set @xmath72 which determines how fields behave in the neighborhood of the closed curve .",
    "elements of the set @xmath72 will be called boundary - changing line operators from @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "boundary - changing line operators may be fused together ( fig .",
    "4 ) which gives rise to a fusion product @xmath73    [ fig4 ]   from a boundary condition @xmath70 to a boundary condition @xmath71 and boundary - changing line operator @xmath35 from @xmath71 to a @xmath74 can be fused to produce a boundary - changing line operator from @xmath70 to @xmath74 .",
    "this operation is denoted @xmath75.,title=\"fig:\",height=192 ]    in every set @xmath76 there is a special element , the trivial boundary - changing line operator , which is an identity element with respect to the fusion product .",
    "the associativity of the fusion product is more difficult to formulate because there are boundary - changing line operators which are physically equivalent , but not equal . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", the difficulty can be explained by saying that the set @xmath72 is actually a category , and it is not natural to talk about equality of objects in a category .",
    "morphisms in this category are point operators inserted at points on the closed curve separating domains @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( fig .",

    "the same reasoning as in the case of boundary - changing point operators tells us that @xmath51 is a vector space .",
    "point operators sitting on the same closed curve can be fused ( fig .",
    "6 ) , which gives rise to a product @xmath78 which is bilinear and associative in an obvious sense .",
    "the category of boundary - changing line operators between @xmath70 and @xmath71 has @xmath72 as its set of objects and the sets @xmath51 as the sets of morphisms .",

    "the above discussion can be summarized by saying that boundary conditions in a 3d tft form a 2-category , whose sets of 1-morphisms are sets @xmath72 and whose sets of 2-morphisms are vector spaces @xmath51 .    kaluza - klien reduction enables us to think about the category @xmath79 in two - dimensional terms .",
    "consider a 3d tft on a 3-manifold of the form @xmath81 $ ] where @xmath30 is an oriented but not necessarily closed 2-manifold .",
    "on the boundaries @xmath82 and @xmath83 we impose boundary conditions @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . kaluza - klein reduction tells us that one can describe the physics of this 3d tft by an effective 2d tft on @xmath30 which depends on @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we claim that the category @xmath79 is the category of branes for this effective 2d tft .",
    "indeed , consider a 3d tft on the half - space @xmath84 , where we imposed the boundary condition @xmath85 on the half - plane @xmath86 and the boundary condition @xmath71 on the half - plane @xmath87 . at the line given by @xmath88 we insert some boundary - changing line operator @xmath89 . to regularize the problem we need to cut out a solid half - cylinder @xmath90 for some @xmath44 and replace @xmath33 with a suitable boundary condition on the part of the boundary given by @xmath91 ( fig .",

    "this monoidal structure is not natural from the 2d viewpoint ( there is no physically reasonable way to define tensor product of branes in a general 2d tft ) .",
    "turning this around , if there is a mathematically natural monoidal structure on a category of branes in a 2d tft , it is likely that this 2d tft arises as a kaluza - klein reduction of a 3d tft on an interval , and its category of branes can be interpreted as the category @xmath98 for some boundary condition @xmath70 in this 3d tft .",
    "we will see an example of this below .    as in 2d tft",
    ", we may consider decorated manifolds , i.e. compact oriented manifolds with a nonempty boundary whose connected components are labeled by elements of the set of boundary conditions .",
    "extended tft in three dimensions assigns a number to a decorated 3-manifold ( the value of the functional integral with given boundary conditions ) , a vector space to a decorated 2-manifold ( the space of states of the effective 1d tft obtained by kaluza - klein reduction on this 2-manifold ) , and a category to a decorated 1-manifold .",

    "if @xmath102 is the @xmath101-dimensional sphere , the corresponding @xmath100-category has an alternative interpretation : it is the category of defects of dimension @xmath100 .",
    "to explain what a defect is , we might imagine that our tft describes a particular macroscopic quantum state of a system of atoms in space - time of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "it may happen that along some oriented submanifold @xmath105 of dimension @xmath100 the atoms are in a different state than elsewhere ( or perhaps there is an altogether different kind of atoms inserted at this submanifold ) .",
    "in such a case one says that there is a defect of dimension @xmath100 inserted at @xmath105 .",
    "zero - dimensional defects are also known as local operators , one - dimensional defects are known as line operators , two - dimensional defects are known as surface operators .",

    "second , the gl - twisted gauge theory has two supercommuting brst operators @xmath221 and @xmath222 , and one can take any linear combination of this as the brst operator which must annihilate the observables : @xmath223 the overall normalization of @xmath126 does not affect the theory , so the gl - twisted theory is really a family of 4d tfts parameterized by points of @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "we will identify @xmath224 with a one - point compactification of the complex plane and will label a particular tft by a parameter @xmath225 .",
