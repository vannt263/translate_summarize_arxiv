    "electron acceleration by laser - plasma interaction has been studied extensively within the context of laser absorption by a plasma .",
    "it has also been studied for the development of techniques aimed at producing hot electrons in order to obtain improved energetic electron sources and to enhance secondary processes including x - ray , @xmath0-ray , positron production and ion acceleration @xcite . in under - dense plasmas ,",
    "various methods of wakefield acceleration @xcite have been proposed and electrons up to @xmath1 have been experimentally observed in the optimal configuration @xcite .",
    "however , the electron acceleration mechanism invoked involves high laser intensity , well into the relativistic regime , and short pulse duration @xmath2 resulting in a small current ( total current of @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is thus of interest to search for alternative configurations wherein the current can be enhanced .    in dense plasmas ,",
    "an energetic electron population may be created by resonant absorption @xcite . in this case , the electrons are accelerated by the resonant plasma waves excited at densities around the critical density by the interaction of a `` long '' laser pulse with a gentle - gradient dense plasma . with the development of lasers of high intensity ( @xmath4 ) , short pulse duration ( @xmath5 ) , and high contrast ( @xmath6 )",
    ", new electron heating mechanisms have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "they involve very sharp density gradients and over - dense plasmas which do not necessarily require a resonant plasma response . among these mechanisms are vacuum heating @xcite , and the so - called ponderomotive or @xmath7 heating @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite have shown that , in many cases , vacuum heating can be more efficient than resonant absorption .",
    "the advantage of these mechanisms is that they involve dense plasmas such that they bear the potential to generate very high currents .    in order to improve the electron acceleration to relativistic values by a laser interacting with an over - dense plasma , particular targets designs",
    "can be used @xcite .",
    "also surface electron plasma waves resonantly excited by the laser on a structured target can be used to reach that goal @xcite .",
    "the electrons interact in this case with the surface plasma wave field that is highly localized at the vacuum - plasma interface and oscillates with the laser frequency .",
    "the local field amplitude is higher than that of the incoming laser such that the typical electron quiver motion is much faster than the electron thermal velocity .",
    "experimental evidence for the feasibility to accelerate electrons and ions by this kind of scheme have recently been reported @xcite .",
    "surface plasma waves can also be excited at the surface of a laser - produced ion channel ( by a mechanism similar to wakefield acceleration ) .",
    "their use has been proven to be an efficient means to improve fast electron generation @xcite . moreover , full 2d simulations of @xmath7 heating @xcite have shown that these oscillations can be unstable and decay into a standing surface plasma wave , revealing at the same time the existence of a non - linear mechanism for generation of surface plasma waves .    however , depending on the characteristics of the excited surface plasma waves the electron population can have very different features . in this paper",
    "we explore with a simple model the different acceleration regimes of an electron in the evanescent electromagnetic field of a surface plasma wave by considering the interaction of a test electron with the high - frequency surface wave fields .",
    "the non - relativistic and relativistic limits are investigated by means of @xmath8 and @xmath9 test particle simulations in order to find the optimal regime for an efficient conversion of the surface wave field energy into electron kinetic energy .",
    "the 1d dynamics calculations are mainly performed in order to analyze the motion of the electron in the direction perpendicular to the surface and its excursion into the evanescent surface plasma field .",
    "some analysis of the @xmath8 motion in the direction parallel to the plasma - vacuum surface is also performed .",
    "after a brief summary of the structure of the surface plasma waves ( section ii ) , the electron acceleration mechanism proposed is studied , first of all for non - relativistic over - dense plasmas ( section iii ) .",
    "the treatment of this case is based on classical concepts such as the idea of a ponderomotive potential @xcite and the separation of high - frequency and low - frequency effects , which allow an analytical 1d treatment ( subsection iii - a ) .",
    "this part is then complemented by full 2d test particle simulations in subsection iii - b .",
    "it permits to identify two different situations for the electron acceleration : the electromagnetic regime and the electrostatic regime .",
    "this non relativistic part of the study is also a tool to understand the results in the relativistic regime .",
    "the next section ( section iv ) studies the relativistic limit where the quiver velocity becomes close to the velocity of light .",
    "first a numerical @xmath8 study is presented ( subsection iv - a ) , as within this domain the possibilities for an analytical treatment are limited .",
    "this allows the determination of the different regimes , and of the optimal conditions in terms of electron acceleration . to complete the study ,",
    "a full @xmath9 numerical study is presented in subsection iv - b .",
    "we find that the electromagnetic regime is the most efficient and taht an electron initially at rest can be self - injected and phase - locks on the vacuum plasma side through @xmath10 mechanisms .",
    "this way the electron is accelerated to velocities larger than the wave phase velocity , mainly in the direction parallel to the plasma - vacuum interface .",
    "the resulting electron total energy scales as @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spw field component perpendicular to the surface of the plasma , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the phase velocity of the spw and @xmath16 is the surface plasma wave frequency .",
    "we consider hereafter a @xmath9 homogeneous plasma in the @xmath17 plane , which supports a surface plasma wave that propagates at the plasma - vacuum interface ( along the @xmath18-direction ) .",
    "the vacuum is along @xmath19 . on the vacuum side ( @xmath19 )",
    ", the resonant surface wave field has the form : @xmath20 with : @xmath21 + while on the plasma side ( @xmath22 ) : @xmath23 with : @xmath24 + where @xmath13 is the maximum value of the electric field on the vacuum side in the @xmath25-direction . in the following",
    "this field will serve as reference field .",
    "@xmath26 is the mode lifetime , @xmath27 is the phase , @xmath28 is the phase velocity of the wave and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the evanescence length in the vacuum and plasma respectively .",
    "the expression for the evanescence length in vacuum is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the evanescence length within the plasma is typically significantly smaller than the evanescence length in vacuum @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath26 will depend on the damping mechanisms that affects the plasma wave , such as linear and non - linear landau damping , and wave breaking effects .    in the cold - plasma limit",
    ", the thermal corrections to the dispersion relation for the surface plasma waves can be neglected , and in the non - relativistic limit we have @xcite the relation : @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath35 the electron density and @xmath36 the electron mass . by solving eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) for @xmath37 it is easily seen that there is an upper limit for @xmath38 .",
    "the surface plasma waves which satisfy this dispersion relation are localized at the plasma surface .",
    "let us now consider in the following some limiting situations for the surface plasma wave .",
    "the relevant parameter to identify the different regimes for the electron plasma wave is @xmath39 .",
    "we will therefore consider different values of this parameter , and the corresponding wave vector that satisfies the dispersion relation eq.([disp ] ) .    in the limit @xmath40 , which is the so - called electromagnetic limit for the surface plasma waves , the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the perpendicular electric field ( @xmath41 ) , while the component of the electric field parallel to the surface ( @xmath42 ) is negligible ( see eq.[champvide ] , which in this limit yields @xmath43 ) .",
    "thus the electric field is mainly in the @xmath25 direction ( i.e. perpendicular to the plasma - vacuum interface ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this case two different situations can be expected , depending on the field intensity . at low field intensity",
    ", it can be anticipated that the role of the magnetic field will be negligible , such that a 1d model can be used , wherein the motion only takes place along @xmath25 . in the opposite case",
    "that the value of the fields is large enough to accelerate the electrons into the relativistic regime , the magnetic field contribution will play an important role . in the electromagnetic limit where @xmath40 , the wave phase velocity along the surface , @xmath44 , is less than but of the same order of magnitude as the velocity of light .",
    "moreover the evanescence length of the wave in vacuum can be quite large : the smaller the value @xmath39 , the larger the vacuum evanescence length .",
    "for example , if @xmath45 we have from eq .",
    "( [ disp ] ) @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , for @xmath48 .",
    "if instead we consider @xmath49 , we have @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . as we will see in the following , large phase velocities @xmath52 , and large evanescent lengths @xmath29 are favorable situations for efficient electron acceleration within the highly relativistic regime .",
    "note that in the electromagnetic limit the evanescence length in the plasma is much less than the evanescence length in vacuum .",
    "in particular in the limit @xmath40 we have @xmath53 .    on the other hand , in the limit @xmath54 , we are close to the electrostatic limit where the magnetic field is always negligible .",
    "the two components of the electric field are of the same order of magnitude and the evanescent length is very small .",
    "typically we always have @xmath55 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . in this case , the wave phase velocity along the surface is much smaller than the velocity of light .",
    "we have thus identified two important parameters characterizing the surface plasma waves , the phase velocity , @xmath15 , along the surface and the evanescent length @xmath29 perpendicular to the surface .",
    "these two parameters will allow us to define different regimes governing the particle acceleration .",
    "this will be done in the next section , where we will concentrate on the solution of the wave on the vacuum side , since it corresponds to a more favorable situation for electron acceleration . in table",
    "i , we have reported these parameters for different values of @xmath39 to be discussed below .    .[runs ]",
    "summary of the parameters for the surface plasma wave with the following definitions : @xmath59 , @xmath31 , @xmath52 and @xmath14 .",
    "the different values of @xmath39 correspond to different regimes for the surface waves .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to verify the scaling of the energy gain with @xmath60 we now consider the simulation for @xmath61 . the final electron momentum for this case and the three situations previously studied is reported in fig.[fig:11 ] .",
    "as seen in table ii , the scaling is confirmed : the normalized final total momentum for the most energetic electrons at @xmath62 gives a value for @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 ( instead of @xmath66 in the case @xmath67 ) . as previously pointed out , the finite lifetime of the surface plasma wave also affects the value of the normalized final total electron momentum , as @xmath68 is much larger than @xmath69 for @xmath70 . as a matter of fact , increasing the lifetime by a factor @xmath71 for this case enhances the normalized final total momentum up to @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "finally , a comparison for the electrostatic case is also given in fig.[fig:11 ] and as expected the final momentum is here much less than in the other cases .",

    "in this paper we present different regimes for electron acceleration within the evanescent field of a surface plasma wave , which were obtained by means of simulations of the motion of test particles .    for low surface plasma field intensities ( characterized by @xmath84 ) ,",
    "we show that in the electromagnetic regime ( characterized by @xmath85 ) the electron motion is essentially @xmath8 .",
    "the electron travels into the vacuum in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "this is due to the fact that the vacuum evanescence length @xmath29 of the spw field is large compared to the amplitude of the high - frequency motion of the electron in the wave , @xmath86 .",
    "if the spw lifetime is larger than @xmath87 , the electrons with a favorable initial phase will gain more energy than provided by the ponderomotive contribution . in the electrostatic regime where @xmath88 , the @xmath42 spw field components induce positive @xmath9 effects , which amplify the electron energy gain .    in the regime where relativistic effects are no longer negligible ( for @xmath89 )",
    ", the relative weight of the perpendicular versus parallel spw field components may limit the interaction of the electron with the full two - dimensional field of the surface wave .",
    "nevertheless , we find optimal conditions for acceleration in which the electron can still gain a large amount of energy , mainly by acceleration parallel to the surface .",
    "this is achieved when the electrons acquire a parallel velocity close to the phase velocity , @xmath15 , of the wave propagating along the surface .",
    "this is observed in the so - called relativistic electromagnetic regime where @xmath90 is large and @xmath85 .",
    "reaching this optimal regime also depends on the lifetime of the surface plasma wave .    in this regime",
    "an electron initially at rest is self - injected and phase - locks on the vacuum side . a significant contribution to the self - injection",
    "is provided by the @xmath18 component of the @xmath10 force @xmath91 resulting in favorable @xmath9 effects in contrast to a purely electrostatic wave . this way the electron gains a substantial amount of parallel energy . in the boosted frame on the vacuum side",
    "the @xmath92 field becomes equal to zero while @xmath93 is invariant .",
    "however , even if in this frame the particle is not initially in phase with the wave and @xmath94 , the electron can still gain a large amount of energy .",
    "this happens while it is subjected to the parallel field during the accelerating part where it is rolling away from the surface before the field changes its sign and becomes decelerating .",
    "this confirms the favorable effect of two - dimensional dynamics . on the plasma side (",
    "this case has not been presented here ) this mechanism is less efficient because the perpendicular component of the spw electric field is smaller than in vacuum .",
    "also its spatial extension is smaller .",
    "moreover , on the plasma side the problem does not become electrostatic in the boosted frame .",
    "finally , we want to outline that we have examined only electrons that are accelerated and are spending their dynamical history on the vacuum side . depending on the phase",
    ", some electrons can also spend their dynamical history inside the plasma . since the electric field perpendicular to the surface is discontinuous and changes sign we found that some electrons can oscillate back and forth from the surface to the plasma .",
    "after some oscillations they may stay on one side or another .",
    "however , we decided not to study such motion in the present work , since the numerical study can not be precise in the presence of a discontinuity .",
    "moreover , a more realistic situation including plasma temperature effects will easily smooth such a discontinuity , without otherwise significantly changing the surface wave solutions @xcite .",
    "other important effects that are missing in this simple model , but have been observed - e.g. in pic simulations @xcite - are the presence of a charge space field at the plasma surface left by the electrons ejected from the surface , or the presence of a quasi - static magnetic field @xcite .",
    "considering these effects is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of further studies .",
