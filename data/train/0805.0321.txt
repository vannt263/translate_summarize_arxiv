    "the source goodsj123634.53 + 621241.3 ( also known as smg gn26 ) was identified as being unusually bright at 70&160@xmath3 m @xcite and for having strong emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules @xcite . at optical wavelengths , gn26 has a merger - like morphology with a disturbed core and evidence of tidal tails on larger scales .",

    "the co(2@xmath01 )  observations of gn26 were taken between 2007 april 14  june 28 with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) in the low - resolution d - configuration , resulting in a total of 26.4 hours of on - source data . the adopted phase center was the irac position of @xmath14(j2000)=@xmath15 , @xmath16(j2000)=@xmath17 @xcite .",
