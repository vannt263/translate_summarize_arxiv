    "polymer films and solids containing light - sensitive molecules have the remarkable property to change their shape and size when irradiated with light .",
    "certain polymer films containing azobenzene chromophores in the main and side chains exhibit strong surface relief features under illumination : trenches under the action of linear polarized light and mounds or wells under the action of circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "circular azobenzene polyester films freely lying on a water surface become elliptically deformed under the influence of linearly polarized light @xcite .",
    "large , reversible shape changes can be induced optically by photoisomerization of nematic elastomers @xcite .",
    "anisotropic bending and unbending behavior of molecular liquid - crystalline films containing azobenzene chromophores has been discovered and studied in refs .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the films can be repeatedly and precisely bent along any chosen direction by using linearly polarized light . fast",
    "( on the timescale of @xmath0  s ) light induced bending of monodomain liquid crystal elastomers has been observed observed in @xcite .",
    "shape - memory effects in polymers containing cinnamic groups induced by ultraviolet light illumination were reported quite recently in ref .",
    "the possibility of coupling between orientational and translational degrees of freedom in liquid crystals was first raised by de gennes @xcite and extended to nematic elastomers in @xcite .",
    "based on this idea a phenomenological theory of photoinduced deformations of nematic elastomers was proposed in @xcite .",
    "a microscopic theory of photoinduced deformation of non - crystalline molecular films was developed in @xcite .",
    "the physical reason for surface - relief formation presented in @xcite is that azo - dyes have two isomeric states : _ cis _ and _ trans_. the molecules in these two states have significantly different shapes .",
    "for example , in the case of azobenzene chromophores the _ trans_-isomer is highly anisotropic whereas the _ cis_-isomer is approximately isotropic @xcite , so the multipole moments and sizes may differ significantly .",
    "it was shown that there are two contributions to the photoelastic interaction : from the orientational interaction between molecules and from the interaction which is due to the change of the van der waals interaction energy between a molecule and all surrounding molecules in its transition to the _",
    "cis_-isomer state .",
    "the former causes the film deformation under the action of linearly polarized light while the latter ( together with the orientational interaction ) is responsible for the surface relief formation under the action of circularly polarized light .",
    "the possibility of creation of wells and humps on the film surfaces under the action of circularly polarized light was discussed .",
    "it is worth noting that in the frame of this approach neither orientational order nor orientational in - plane anisotropy of the film in the absence of irradiation was assumed .",
    "one can say that the absorption of linearly polarized light creates an orientational order in the film which in turn produces anisotropic deformation . quite recently , based on the idea of isomeric states , a theory of the polarization - dependent photocontractions of polydomain elastomers due to light - induced director rotation , was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present report is to apply this approach to anisotropic bending of molecular films by polarized light .",
    "we present an elastic energy of the film in the presence of polarized light and solving equations of equilibrium , we show that a change in the polarization direction of light causes a corresponding change of the shape of the film . we also show that the curvature of an irradiated film is a non - monotonic function of the extinction coefficient .",

    "we assumed here that that the non - irradiated film is neither orientationally nor translationally ordered in the @xmath15-plane and therefore we modeled its elastic properties by using the isotropic energy ( [ elast ] ) .",

    "@xmath17 is the gravity force with @xmath18 being the film density and @xmath19 being the acceleration of free fall .",
    "the last term in eq.([eltot ] ) gives the change of the elastic energy due to the interaction between the electromagnetic wave ( [ elw ] ) and the film .",
