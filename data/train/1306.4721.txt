    "localization of a non - cooperative target using a number of sensors is usually performed through measurement of time difference of arrival ( tdoa ) @xcite , direction of arrival ( doa ) @xcite@xcite or received signal strength ( rss ) @xcite .",

    "the third approach is considerably less complex and less demanding of energy , though it has a more modest performance . a good body of literature exists concerning localization of a target using rss measurements assuming acoustic @xcite or radio frequency ( rf ) @xcite propagation models , or without relying on any particular propagation model @xcite .",
    "these works assume an unquantized measurement of the received signal , or its power , in noise . in practice",
    ", however , measurements are quantized , or even binary when resources are scarce .",
    "model independent localization schemes using noise - free binary measurements have been studied @xcite . in @xcite a simple averaging approach for cooperative rf localization is proposed . in general , model independent approaches do not have a very good performance since they do not use the information regarding the propagation of the signal . in @xcite a maximum likelihood estimator is proposed for localization of an rf target using binary signal measurements .",
    "the sensors perform coherent detection which requires phase synchronization with the target and , hence , it is not suitable for simple detectors .",
    "none of the above mentioned papers consider localization of an rf source with non - coherent detectors , which are preferred due to simplicity and low power consumption . in @xcite ,",
    "the case of non - coherent quantized observations are considered under rayleigh fading . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "localization of a non - cooperative target using non - coherent detectors has not been studied in the absence of fading .",
    "this scenario , considered in this paper , is important and relevant to many applications , since it models the cases where the system operates in an environment with little or no scattering , such as an open field .",
    "we first calculate the fisher information and the cramr - rao bounds ( crb ) for the estimation of location and power of the target for general binary detectors , thereby generalizing the work in @xcite to the case where the transmit power is unknown .",
    "we then apply these results to the case of non - coherent binary detectors .",

    "a large number of sensors , capable of non - coherent binary power detection , are uniformly scattered in a infinite region with density @xmath1 .",
    "each sensor makes a binary decision by comparing its received power to a threshold , @xmath2 , and reports its decision , @xmath3 , and its location , @xmath4 $ ] , to a fusion center , where @xmath5 is the sensor index . the fusion center s task is to estimate the location and power of the target .",

    "however , we note that the power law propagation model is not realistic for short distances @xcite . to get around this problem ,",
    "we use the fact that the probability of having a sensor very close to the target is small .",
