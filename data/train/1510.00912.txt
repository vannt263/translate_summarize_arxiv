    "<S> spontaneous creation of solitons in quadratic media by the downconversion , i.e. , parametric instability against the generation of fundamental - frequency excitations , from the truncated airy - wave ( aw ) mode in the second - harmonic component is studied . </S>",
    "<S> parameter regions are identified for the generation of one , two , and three solitons , with additional small - amplitude jets \" . </S>",
    "<S> shares of the total power carried by individual solitons are found . </S>",
    "<S> also considered are soliton patterns generated by the downconversion from a pair of aws bending in opposite directions .    </S>",
    "<S> transmission of waves with a specific intrinsic structure along curved paths has drawn a great deal of interest in photonics and related areas . </S>",
    "<S> a well - known class of self - bending beams is based on airy wave ( aw ) packets , as demonstrated , theoretically and experimentally , in quantum mechanics @xcite , a variety of settings in optics @xcite-@xcite , plasmonics @xcite-@xcite , electron beams @xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite , gas discharge @xcite , and water waves @xcite . while airy beams are eigenmodes of linear media , their propagation in systems with cubic @xcite-@xcite and quadratic ( alias @xmath0 ) @xcite-@xcite , @xcite nonlinearities was studied too . in the latter case , </S>",
    "<S> the formation of two - color beams by the aw input launched in the fundamental - frequency ( ff ) component ( _ upconversion _ ) was analyzed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the objective of the present work is to analyze an alternative possibility of the _ downconversion _ , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , the generation of solitons , that are fundamental eigenmodes of the @xmath0 media , by the parametric instability ( pi ) of ( truncated ) airy beams launched in the second harmonic ( sh ) , which are exact linear modes of the system if ff perturbations are not added . in this connection </S>",
    "<S> , it is relevant to note that formation ( _ shedding _ ) of solitons by aws in cubic media was recently analyzed @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite , while the formation of @xmath0 solitons via the pi of straight sh wave packets , such as symmetric gaussians , was studied still earlier @xcite-@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the scenario of the generation of solitons by small random perturbations in the ff field interacting with the parametrically - unstable sh input itself demonstrates instability , producing quasi - random patterns including @xmath0 solitons and  jets \" ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , systematic simulations make it possible to identify regular features of the emerging soliton sets , such as the number of major solitons and shares of the total power carried away by each of them .    </S>",
    "<S> the  type - i \" model of the one - dimensional @xmath0 system , with the single ff component , @xmath1 , and the sh component , @xmath2 , is taken in the usual scaled form @xcite-@xcite:@xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the propagation distance and transverse coordinate , the second derivatives represent the diffraction in the paraxial approximation , @xmath6 stands for the complex conjugate , and the mismatch parameter , @xmath7 , may be scaled to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the system conserves the total power ( manley - rowe invariant ) and momentum,@xmath9 along with the corresponding hamiltonian .    </S>",
    "<S> the self - bending linear modes for the sh in the absence of the ff component are generated by the input in the form of truncated aws @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the standard airy function , @xmath12 and @xmath13 determine the amplitude and spatial scale of the wave , while the truncation parameter , @xmath14 , makes the total power of input finite @xcite : @xmath15     solitons , along with jets `` , from the sh input ( [ w0 ] ) with @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ; and @xmath18 , respectively ( in all cases , @xmath19 ) . here </S>",
    "<S> ( and in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] below ) the intensity of the ff component is displayed ; the respective patterns of the sh field are shown in figs . </S>",

    "<S> to demonstrate how the coherence of the input affects the output , left and right panels display , severally , the results generated by the full aw input , and by its tailless '' version , in which all but the main lobe of the aw shape is cut off . </S>",
    "<S> this figure , as well as figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] , pertain to the system with zero mismatch , @xmath20 . ]    . ]    </S>",
    "<S> most results are displayed below for @xmath19 , in which case the multi - lobe structure of the truncated input seems virtually identical to the untruncated one . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in the case of @xmath20 , which is chiefly considered here , the scaling invariance of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ type - i ] ) demonstrates that , at fixed @xmath14 , the normalized total power of different inputs is actually measured by single parameter @xmath21 defined in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) .    in simulations , input ( [ w0 ] ) was used for the sh field , with small (  seed \" ) random perturbations in the ff mode initiating the onset of the pi ( the results do not essentially depend on characteristics of the seed ) . for collecting the results which are displayed below , it was necessary to use a large integration domain , of size @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> in the course of the simulations , it was checked that the total power is conserved , and the total momentum remains equal to zero , see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ w ] ) .    as shown in the plots collected in the left column of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , outcomes of the pi - initiated evolution can be summarized as the generation of one or several clearly identified @xmath0 solitons , supplemented by  jets \" with essentially smaller amplitudes , and still smaller radiation features . </S>",
    "<S> additional analysis demonstrates that the shape of individual solitons is very close to that known in the standard @xmath0 model @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the number of the major solitons raises from @xmath23 to @xmath24 to @xmath25 , as @xmath21 increases from @xmath26 to @xmath27 to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the generation of the patterns being initiated by random small perturbations amplified by the pi , the picture always includes random features , making it difficult to exactly identify values of @xmath21 corresponding to boundaries between the outcomes with different numbers of major solitons . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the trend to the increase of the soliton number with the growth of @xmath21 is evident . </S>",
    "<S> results demonstrating more than three major solitons are not presented here , as the respective simulations must be run in a huge domain , and they would require a very wide waveguide for the experimental realization .    </S>",
    "<S> if two or three solitons are generated by the aw input , their origin can not be unambiguously linked to particular lobes in the airy - wave input , as the emerging solitons become visible after some distance of  latent \" growth of the pi , which separates the input and the multi - soliton pattern . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the generation of the multi - soliton pattern , along with the  jets \" , is a coherent effect provided by the specific structure of the input . to further address the latter point , plots collected in the right column of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] report the results of the simulations performed , for the same values of @xmath12 , @xmath29 , and @xmath14 , with the  tailless \" version of input ( [ w0 ] ) , in which only the main lobe of the airy - wave profile is kept , while the rest is eliminated . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the patterns generated by the full aw , and solely by its main lobe , become essentially different with the increase of the number of the generated solitons . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , the patterns originating from the  tailless \" inputs feature much weaker radiation components . nevertheless , the  tailless \" initial beam , that keeps the inherent asymmetry of the aw , is basically different from the ordinary symmetric inputs which were commonly used for the downconversion - driven generation of @xmath0 solitons @xcite-@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to measure the share of the total power carried by each major soliton generated from the aw input ( [ w0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these shares are displayed , as functions of the truncation factor @xmath14 , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , for the full and tailless `` inputs alike . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the single - soliton pattern generated by the full input , the share captured by the soliton decreases roughly @xmath30 with the growth of @xmath14 , which implies that only a few leading lobes of the airy - shaped input build the single soliton , while the total power of the input grows @xmath31 [ see eq . ( [ p ] ) ] . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the combined share carried by all the solitons in the multi - soliton pattern decreases essentially slower , which implies that , as mentioned above , the generation of several solitons is a coherent effect produced by the entire airy - shaped input . naturally , the result of the evolution of the tailless '' input is not sensitive to the overall truncation . at large values of @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the net power share carried away by the one / two or three solitons is larger , respectively , by factors @xmath32 or @xmath33 in the case of the tailless \" initial conditions , as in that case much less power is spent on the generation the jets and radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> note that , if a single soliton is generated , it always moves to the right , i.e. , in the same direction in which the input aw self - accelerates in the framework of the linear equation for the sh . on the other hand , the two- and three - soliton patterns feature , in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig3 ] , a situation in which a soliton with a larger amplitude may move in the opposite direction , carrying a larger power than that carried to the right by one or two other solitons . as mentioned above , in all cases the total momentum ( [ w ] ) remains equal to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial symmetry of the system suggests to consider a combination of two inputs which launch the self - bending aws in the opposite directions , with separation @xmath34 and phase shift @xmath35 between them:@xmath36   . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{symm}\\ ] ] this input is subject to the hermitian - symmetry condition , @xmath37 , which holds in the course of the subsequent evolution . in the absence of the ff seed , </S>",
    "<S> input ( [ symm ] ) gives rise to two linear sh waves passing through each other , while the perturbed evolution creates @xmath0 solitons from the left and right aw components , which interact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> here we report results obtained for large values of @xmath29 , corresponding to relatively small values of @xmath21 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) , i.e. , the generation of a single soliton by each aw input separately ( otherwise , the interaction pattern is very complex ) .    </S>",
    "<S> typical results of the interaction of two symmetric aw inputs are presented in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] , for both in - phase and out - of - phase pairs , i.e. , @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ symm ] ) . when the separation between them is small enough ( @xmath40 for @xmath38 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the closely set left and right inputs generate a single soliton , in agreement with the fact that each input carries a value of @xmath43 which is far too small for the creation of more than one soliton . </S>",
    "<S> however , the increase of @xmath44 allows the set of the two aw inputs to generate two solitons . in the case of @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> , it is well known that the two solitons , placed at a moderately large distance , repel each other @xcite , hence they separate and eventually appear as a pair of solitons moving in directions opposite to those implied by the underlying aws , as observed in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] .    ) with @xmath38 and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the top , middle , and bottom rows demonstrate , respectively , the direct generation of a single @xmath0 soliton ( at @xmath45 for both @xmath38 and @xmath42 ) ; the generation of two separating solitons with extra jets \" ( at @xmath46 for @xmath38 and @xmath47 for @xmath39 ) ; and the fusion of two emerging solitons into one ( at @xmath48 for @xmath38 and @xmath49 for @xmath39 ) . in all cases , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath19 . ]    . ]    in the case of the in - phase input pair ( [ symm ] ) , with @xmath38 , the direct interaction between the emerging solitons should be attractive , on the contrary to what is observed in the left middle panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , which features separating solitons . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is seen too that the space between the solitons is filled by radiation , the pressure from which may give rise to repulsion @xcite . note that , while the two solitons separate , the radiation forms a relatively strong central  jet \" . </S>",
    "<S> additional simulations demonstrate that , at specific values of @xmath44 ( e.g. , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively ) the central  jet \" may form an additional soliton . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , if @xmath44 is large enough ( @xmath54 for @xmath38 and @xmath55 for @xmath39 ) , the two aw inputs generate two free solitons , which then collide and merge into a single one , as clearly seen in the bottom row of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    the effect of nonzero mismatch , @xmath56 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ type - i ] ) , was explored too . </S>",
    "<S> while @xmath57 prevents the generation of solitons , at the same values of other parameters as considered above , @xmath58 tends to increase the number of the generated solitons . </S>",
    "<S> these trends are easily explained by the cascading approximation , which eliminates the sh in favor of the ff component @xcite-@xcite , @xmath59 , and reduces the @xmath0 system ( [ type - i ] ) to the single nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath60 , which , obviously , gives rise to one or multiple solitons at @xmath58 , and does not produce them at @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example of the generation of two solitons at @xmath58 is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] , for parameter values corresponding to @xmath61 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ p ] ) , which , as said above , is capable to generate only a single soliton in the system with @xmath20 .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a scenario for the interplay of aws ( airy waves ) with the @xmath0 nonlinearity via downconversion , i.e. , the pi ( parametric instability ) seeded by small random ff perturbations added to the truncated aw input in the sh component . </S>",
    "<S> although the downconversion mechanism , driven by the pi , exhibits inherent randomness , it is possible to identify its basic features , such as the number of emerging major solitons and power shares carried by them , including the patterns generated by symmetric pairs of right- and left - bending aw inputs . a natural generalization of the present analysis may be its development for two - dimensional @xmath0 media , where aw inputs are available too , and emerging solitons are stable @xcite . </S>"
