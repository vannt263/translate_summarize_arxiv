    "in this work , we will present a method for implementing final state interactions ( fsi or rescattering ) , i.e. the strong interactions between weak decay products .",
    "these fsi will be treated as elastic , and a special care will be devoted to define this concept . in particular",
    ", elasticity under a symmetry group will be defined as a special case of a generalized elasticity concept .",
    "this work has to be understood as a first step beyond the trivial treatment of fsi , where fsi are introduced as elastic under su(2 ) .",
    "the decays we have in mind are the b and d decays to two charmless pseudoscalars . in these b decays , cp violation is expected to occur . to be able to extract the values of the relevant parameters from experiments , in order to compare them to standard model values",
    ", we must dispose of an appropriate parametrization .",
    "quark diagrams are usually thought to be appropriate for such a goal , but , as we will see , these quark diagrams should be properly defined in order to be of any use . in all this , fsi play no fundamental role , they just mix up final states . therefore , it is necessary to treat them to reach the underlying dynamics .",
    "the interesting point is that the model we propose to treat elastic fsi , based on the * s*-matrix and watson s theorem ,  will point towards a specific definition of the quark diagrams .",
    "a lot of papers exist on this subject , some of them are listed in the bibliography .",
    "the decays we are considering proceed via the weak decay of @xmath0 or @xmath1 quark .",
    "we will treat weak interaction at the lowest order .",
    "the strong interactions are involved in the three following processes : they renormalize the weak interaction , they confine quarks into hadrons and they determine the asymptotic out states ( fsi ) .",
    "obviously , these two last manifestations of strong interactions are a priori difficult to distinguish from each other , because the out states can be considered as completely hadronized only when they no longer interact .",
    "the definition of fsi will be based on the following consideration : only hadrons , and not quarks enter the s - matrix .",
    "consequently , fsi will be defined as the ( strong ) interactions between hadrons . a typical decay process like @xmath2 is a heavy quark @xmath3 decaying  quickly  followed by the hadronization .",
    "this produces an intermediate real hadron state noted inside accolades : for example @xmath4 .",
    "then these hadrons interact by the fsi towards the final state : @xmath5 .",
    "this picture is quite schematic and we could say as well that we define intermediate decay amplitudes @xmath4 ( also qualified as bare ) as free of any fsi effects . in other words , fsi factorize from weak bare decay amplitudes .",
    "these bare amplitudes have no absorptive part since they must be real except for ckm factors ( equivalently , their behaviour under cp is simply cp@xmath6 ) .    to summarize",
    ", the model will be based on three main points .",
    "( 1 ) unitarity of the * s*-matrix for a given set of rescattering channels , ( 2 ) the identification of bare amplitudes ( elementary processes ) as the part that get complex conjugated under cp .",
    "these two points will then imply that ( 3 ) fsi are treated as elastic among the chosen set of rescattering channels .",
    "usually , when adding phases to isospin amplitudes to introduce fsi , one is implicitly considering that the * s*-matrix is unitary when restricted to a set of rescattering channels belonging to the same isomultiplet .",
    "we will extend this to more general sets of rescattering channels .",
    "this model can be characterized by the way bare amplitudes are identified .",
    "this is a hypothesis , which is strictly equivalent to the general elasticity hypothesis as soon as the * s*-matrix is unitary .",
    "the validity of the present approach is discussed in the conclusion .",
    "note that other propositions exist for the identification of bare amplitudes ; see for instance the k - matrix formalism , which modelize an inelastic approach to the treatment of fsi .    from this picture",
    ", we will naturally introduce quark diagrams ( qd ) at the bare level .",
    "fsi are then viewed as mixings of these bare amplitudes . since bare amplitudes must be real , these qd are defined as real .",
    "the important point is that by defining qd at the bare level , they are characterized by basic topological configurations .",
    "this in turn is very important to relate these qd to elementary dynamical processes .",
    "basic topologies are then mixed by fsi .",
    "we will develop all this further in the text .",
    "for a given final state , we can not have arbitrary intermediate states .",
    "fsi being strong interactions , these intermediate states must have the same charge , strangeness , ... also , the available energy will determine the set of coupled open channels for a given set of quantum numbers .",
    "among these coupled states , we will only consider two - pseudoscalar states .",
    "thus we are neglecting transitions between these pp states and many particle states , vector meson states ... this will be used when demonstrating watson s theorem .",
    "the approximate invariance under flavour exchange of the strong interaction implies very severe constraints on decay amplitudes and on fsi . at the b or d mass , su(2 ) or su(3 )",
    "are expected not to be badly broken . as we will see extensively , working under a symmetry group fixes the set of coupled states , this set being bigger under su(3 ) than under su(2 ) .",
    "the symmetry group also fixes the structure of the couplings of these states .",
    "these couplings ( or mixings ) will be called su(n ) elastic ( n=2 , 3 , ... ) .",
    "one immediate question is to find a link between a su(2 ) description and a su(3 ) description of fsi , and this will be thoroughly carried out .",
    "phenomenologically , it is sometimes questionable to treat su(3 ) mixings as elastic , one example detailed at the end of this paper is the well - known su(3 ) prediction @xmath7 , which can be lifted by a su(3 ) breaking in the fsi .",
    "on the other hand the su(2 ) restriction may be too strong , since we neglect many possible rescattering channels .",
    "an intermediate way is proposed in this work , by distinguishing elasticity from elasticity under a symmetry group .",
    "let us first recall how fsi are usually treated when working under a flavour symmetry group .",
    "the b and d decays we wish to describe are those into two charmless pseudoscalars .",
    "we will work under su(2 ) or su(3 ) , at the lowest order in electroweak interaction .",
    "let us analyze the decays @xmath8 to @xmath9 and @xmath10 under su(2 ) .",
    "the well - known isospin analysis leads to the following parametrization of the physical decay amplitudes : @xmath11    where these isospin amplitudes correspond to @xmath12 ckm elements are not explicitly written .",
    "these amplitudes contain the weak interaction at the lowest order , and all the strong interaction , including fsi .",
    "the usual procedure to take into account fsi is to associate phases to the isospin amplitudes as :    @xmath13    we can therefore identify the bare amplitudes for these decays :    @xmath14    from these bare amplitudes , we can reintroduce fsi using a matrix procedure : @xmath15    with @xmath16 given by :    @xmath17    this matrix method is strictly equivalent to the usual procedure ( [ isorenorm ] ) .",
    "however , it is now apparent that fsi are introduced as mixings between the @xmath18 and @xmath19 intermediate states .",
    "the su(3 ) analyses of b and d decays into two uncharmed pseudoscalars are given in the appendix .",
    "let us consider the following set of decays :    @xmath20    again ckm elements are not written explicitly .",
    "the usual procedure to take fsi into account in this su(3 ) context is simply :    @xmath21    we can therefore identify bare decays as :    @xmath22    and starting with these decompositions , we can reintroduce fsi using a matrix procedure :    @xmath23    with    @xmath24    as for su(2 ) , we see that fsi effects reduce to some mixings among intermediate states .",
    "but a major difference arises : under su(3 ) , the @xmath25 also mixes with @xmath26 states .",
    "this mixing goes beyond su(2 ) since @xmath26 states and @xmath27 are in different su(2 ) representations .",
    "the same matrix @xmath28 can also be used to introduce fsi in other decay decompositions into matrix elements .",
    "for example , b@xmath29 bare decays :    @xmath30    and we can see that applying @xmath28 is equivalent to the usual prescription ( [ su(3)usualpre ] ) and @xmath31 .      having written those matrix representations for fsi",
    ", the following questions can be addressed :    ( 1 ) _  what is the underlying theoretical framework ?",
    "_ we would like to know precisely the hypotheses concerning this procedure . also , the elasticity concept has to be properly defined . finally , the properties of these m matrices like unitarity and symmetry should be explained .",
    "this section is based on watson s theorem .",
    "su(n ) flavor symmetry implications ?",
    "_ we would like to find a systematic way to calculate mixing matrices like @xmath16 and @xmath28 .",
    "the link between these two matrices will also be analyzed .",
    "the fact that the same matrix can be used for different sets of reactions will be explained .",
    "( 3 ) _  the use of quark diagrams ? _ we will argue that quark diagrams should be used to parametrize bare decays .",
    "in other words , we will parametrize physical decay amplitudes using fsi mixing matrices for the rescattering effects , and quark diagrams for the weak decays , their gluonic corrections ( but no absorptive part ) and the hadronizations .",
    "these three points will be considered in the three following sections . in the last section",
    ", we will apply the advocated procedure to analyze systematically the b and d decays into two uncharmed pseudoscalars .",
    "let us summarize the general procedure we suggest in this paper .",
    "watson s theorem implies that the physical decay amplitudes for a set of processes can be factorized into a fsi part and a bare part .",
    "we can then extract from the full weak amplitudes the fsi contributions by putting some intermediate states on - shell , and these states are hadron states entering the s matrix .",
    "bare amplitudes are then parametrized using quark diagrams , and fsi are introduced using mixing matrices .",
    "finally , dynamical ( e.g. the choice of the set of coupled states ) or symmetry ( e.g. su(2 ) ) considerations will determine the form of these matrices .",
    "part of the following discussion is borrowed from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "watson s theorem will allow us to single out the final state interaction effects inside the physical weak decay amplitudes of b or d. remember that we are working to lowest order in electroweak interaction .",
    "let us begin by expressing the generalized watson s theorem .",
    "by w we denote the column vector formed with the weak amplitudes into the possible final states :    @xmath32    s will be the s - matrix containing the coupling among these final states :    @xmath33    the processes entering this s - matrix proceed dominantly via strong interaction , the weak contribution being much smaller .",
    "thus this matrix is block - diagonal , each block representing mixing among states of definite flavour quantum numbers .",
    "the important point is that w and s are built from hadron states like @xmath34 , ... ; i.e. states which decay via electroweak interactions only .",
    "the _ generalized watson s theorem _ then reads :    @xmath35    this means that fsi effects contained in @xmath36 factorize , leaving bare amplitudes @xmath37 , which contain no fsi .",
    "these amplitudes will be written as :    @xmath38    where the @xmath39 denotes intermediate states .",
    "these bare amplitudes contain the weak decay of the heavy quark , with its gluonic corrections , and the hadronization of the intermediate hadron state , but no fsi effect .",
    "these rescattering effects are introduced as interactions between these intermediate hadron states using @xmath36 .",
    "we can also say that this theorem allows one to extract from physical amplitudes the fsi part from the bare part , and this is done at the hadronic level . in other words , it is hadron states entering the s matrix that are put on mass - shell as intermediate states .",
    "this can also be interpreted as a renormalization of bare amplitudes induced by rescattering effects .",
    "the complete demonstration is in the appendix .",
    "the main features are :    \\(1 ) watson s theorem follows from the unitarity condition for the complete * s*-matrix built from w and s : @xmath40    thus we can say that @xmath41 is a unitarization of weak bare decay amplitudes , since with the adjunction of the strong phases @xmath36 , the full * s * matrix is unitary .",
    "\\(2 ) bare amplitudes are identified as the part of physical amplitudes that get complex conjugated under cp .",
    "that is the main point , since this identification implies elasticity as we will see in the next paragraph .",
    "inverting the argument , we want to build a model of fsi based on the elastic hypothesis , we are thus led to this identification .",
    "elasticity is equivalent to the unitarity of the strong s - matrix containing the coupling .",
    "the elasticity hypothesis is then hidden in the feature ( 1 ) above concerning unitarity of * s*. indeed , as soon as * s * is unitary , @xmath42 and @xmath36 are also unitary ( eq([unitarityimp ] ) ) .",
    "this implies that we have the conservation of probability among the coupled channels :    @xmath43    if we note the intermediate states , i.e. states produced and not yet rescattered by \\{x@xmath44 } and final out states by x@xmath44 , we can rewrite the strong s - matrix ( [ strongcoupl ] ) as : @xmath45    and probability conservation expresses itself as :    @xmath46    this is another expression of elasticity .",
    "it is clear that if we consider all the possible final states , * s * will be unitary . in practice",
    "however , we consider couplings only among a subset of final states ( for example , only @xmath47 states ) , and thus we neglect many other possible mixings .",
    "we then impose the unitarity of a truncated * s*-matrix , limited to this subset of states .",
    "this is the elastic hypothesis ; it is characterized by probability conservation among this subset of states .",
    "the most important restriction we will impose on the mixings is to consider coupling between states of two pseudoscalars ( in the s - wave ) only . mixing with states containing vector mesons , or many particle states",
    "are thus neglected .",
    "this restriction is convenient in order to ensure a symmetric form for s. indeed , s will be symmetric if the transition amplitudes are invariant under time - reversal , and since a general state may catch a different phase than pp states under cp , they will not be considered .",
    "let us define some technical tools used in the rest of the paper :    \\(1 ) the basis of _ eigenchannels _ @xmath48 where s is diagonal , with matrix elements :    @xmath49    so these states @xmath50 do not mix under rescattering .",
    "elasticity is manifested as the unit norm , which in turn is equivalent to unitarity for s.    \\(2 ) these diagonal elements of s are the _ strong phases _ : @xmath51    \\(3 ) and since the s - matrix is symmetric and unitary , we can diagonalize it using _ a real orthogonal transformation _",
    "@xmath52 :    @xmath53    the orthogonal diagonalizing matrix o also relates the eigenchannel basis to the physical one :    @xmath54    \\(4 ) the _ mixing matrix _ @xmath55 is simply the square root of s , which appears in watson s theorem , and defined as :    @xmath56    \\(5 ) with these tools , we can give another derivation of watson s theorem .",
    "let us define some renormalized out eigenstates as :    @xmath57    and this is equivalent to @xmath58 :    @xmath59    in the physical basis , we have the following situation :    @xmath60    i.e. the development of the intermediate states in terms of intermediate eigenchannels is the same as the development of final asymptotic states in terms of out eigenchannels .",
    "putting all this in equations gives :    @xmath61    and the final result is :    @xmath62    for the decay amplitudes , we recover watson s theorem :    @xmath63      the treatment of weak decay amplitudes of d is the same as in the b case .",
    "we will write : @xmath64    however , since fsi in d decays proceed at a lower energy than in b decays , and since the number of open channels in d decays is much smaller than in b decays , the m matrix structure is not necessarily the same for b and d decays , and the rescattering phases are different .      in the case of only one rescattering channel , writing @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    ", @xmath41 is equivalent to the well - known result :    @xmath67    i.e. that under cp the weak phase @xmath68 is reversed and not the strong phase @xmath69 .",
    "the matrix version for many rescattering channels really appears as a simple generalization .",

    "the decaying meson ( b , d , ... ) , on the other hand , fixes the energy scale at which fsi take place , and thus determines the values of the strong phases .",

    "the su(2 ) fsi eigenchannels are then    @xmath78    which means that @xmath9 , @xmath74 are mixed under su(2 ) , since they contain the same representations of isospin 3/2 and 1/2@xmath79 , but @xmath77 , being in a different 1/2 representation , stays alone . the @xmath80 matrix ( clebsch - gordan coefficients )",
    "is block - diagonal , and so is @xmath16 .",

    "as we have said , applying the su(n ) mixing matrix on su(n ) bare decompositions is equivalent , i.e. the usual prescription is equivalent to a mixing of states , and the m matrices provide a clear representation of these mixings .",
