    "spatial and temporal correlations in spatially extended systems with a conservation law or a continuous invariance are widely observed to satisfy a scaling or homogeneity property .",
    "for instance , if the system is described by a single scalar field @xmath0 , the correlation function @xmath1 satisfies @xmath2 under rescaling of space by a factor @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the dynamic exponent while @xmath5 describes the spatial scaling of the field .",
    "equation ( 1 ) holds in the rest frame of the @xmath6-fluctuations , so that if the system has wavelike excitations , e.g. , kinematic waves @xcite of moving @xmath6-fluctuations , it is necessary to perform a galilean shift to co - move with the wave .",
    "the exponent @xmath4 then describes the dissipation of the fluctuation wave , with a fluctuation of spatial extent @xmath7 having a lifetime proportional to @xmath8 .",
    "now consider the scaling properties of systems with several coupled fields , say @xmath9 , whose dynamical evolution involves inter - field couplings both at the linear and nonlinear levels which result in propagating kinematic waves . at the linear level , the problem requires diagonalizing the matrix of couplings .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath10 involve linear combinations of the @xmath11 and represent modes that propagate as independent kinematic waves .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the eigenvalues @xmath12 encode respectively the speeds and dampings of the corresponding kinematic waves , and in general , differ from one wave to another . by performing a galilean shift with speed @xmath13",
    ", one may move to the rest frame of mode @xmath14 ; kinematic waves corresponding to other modes are not stationary in this frame , however , and these moving modes also contribute to the dissipation of mode @xmath14 as they are coupled nonlinearly to it .",
    "the correlation function @xmath15 is expected to satisfy @xmath16 where @xmath17 characterizes the spatial scaling of mode @xmath14 and @xmath18 is the corresponding dynamic exponent .",
    "the question arises : is there a single common value @xmath4 which characterizes the decay of all the modes @xmath14 ?",
    "when the answer is yes , as in fact it generally is , we say that the system obeys _",
    "strong dynamic scaling_. considerable interest therefore attaches to exceptions to this general rule .",
    "accordingly , one would like to characterize the conditions for the occurrence of _ weak dynamic scaling _",
    ", when at least one @xmath19 is different from the rest .",
    "_ a priori _ , there are two sets of circumstances when weak dynamic scaling may be expected :    \\(i ) if the transformation from @xmath11 to @xmath10 , which is designed to decouple modes at the linear level , actually succeeeds in decoupling them for the full nonlinear problem , then evidently each mode evolves autonomously and independent @xmath19 s may arise .",
    "in fact , a complete decoupling at the nonlinear level does occur in the context of a reduced model of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , and may well arise in other problems as well . in the mhd case , however , it turns out that both modes obey evolution equations with similar ( autonomous ) nonlinearites , so that a common value of @xmath4 ensues . but this need not be the case for other problems .",
    "\\(ii ) consider a situation in which the evolution of a subset of the fields , say @xmath20 , does not involve the others @xmath21 , while the evolution of the set @xmath21 does involve @xmath20 . in this case",
    ", @xmath22 and @xmath23 may take on distinct values .",
    "indeed , this is borne out by numerical studies of two - field dynamics @xcite which show that weak scaling occurs if the evolution is autonomuous in one of the two fields , or very nearly so , in which case strong crossover effects may be expected .",
    "one of the principal results of this paper , which we present below , is a _",
    "third _ possible scenario for weak dynamical scaling , where _ neither _ field is autonomous",
    ".      in this paper we examine weak and strong dynamical scaling in a system with two coupled fields , which result in two coupled kinematic waves characterized by mode coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we work both with a lattice model involving two sets of spins , and with the corresponding continuum equations involving two coupled scalar fields .",
    "the analysis of the lattice model is facilitated by showing that along certain representative loci in parameter space , the steady state has product measure form .",
    "this allows the current to be found , and a continuum expansion to be made , with coefficients that explicitly involve the parameters and mean occupations of the lattice model .",
    "this enables us to make direct comparisons between the results of numerical simulations of the lattice model and analytical self - consistent calculations for the continuum equations .",
    "our most interesting result is the identification of a _ third _ set of circumstances , beyond ( i ) and ( ii ) mentioned in section [ background ] , in which weak dynamic scaling results , despite each mode being nonlinearly coupled to the other .",
    "this involves symmetry properties of the kinematic waves : we find weak dynamic scaling if we choose model parameters so that the evolution equations are invariant under inversion of the second mode coordinate @xmath26 but not under @xmath27 . in that case",
    "our numerical simulations show that @xmath28 , while @xmath29 with multiplicative logarithmic corrections .",
    "we also study the problem within a self - consistent mode coupling calculation which shows that the different dynamic exponents arise in a rather interesting way : the _ linearized _ version of the problem has @xmath30 for both fields . the scattering of @xmath24 by fluctuations in @xmath25 and _ vice versa _ gives rise to singular corrections to the diffusivity for @xmath24 , leading to @xmath28 .",
    "the fluctuations , however , cause no singular correction to the relaxation of @xmath25 , leaving @xmath31 . for most other parameter values",
    ", however , we find the more common strong dynamic scaling with @xmath32 .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ continuummodel ] , we review briefly the continuum stochastic dynamical equations of ref.@xcite . in section [ lattice ]",
    "we present the lattice model , and show how the condition of pairwise balance can be used to find the exact steady state if the transition rates satisfy a certain relation .",
    "we characterize changes of the symmetry of the evolution equations as overall densities are varied , and report the results of extensive numerical simulations which show that the values of the dynamic exponents depend strongly on these symmetries .",
    "in particular , we present evidence for weak dynamic scaling when the two kinematic waves have different symmetries . in section [ analytwds ]",
    "we describe analytical methods , primarily a one - loop self - consistent treatment of the continuum stochastic pdes , for calculating the exponents in the weak dynamic scaling regime .",
    "we also outline a dynamic renormalization group procedure for this regime , discuss the difficulties that arise therein , and remind the reader how strong dynamic scaling is restored for generic values of the parameters in the model .",
    "we close in section [ summary ] with a summary .",
    "we review very briefly here the construction of our model equations of motion ; details may be found in @xcite . the physical system which inspired the initial work on the model was a lattice drifting through a dissipative medium .",
    "there are at least two examples of this : ( i ) steadily sedimenting colloidal crystals and ( ii ) a flux lattice driven , by the action of the lorentz force of an imposed supercurrent , through a type ii superconductor . if inertia is ignored , the equation of motion of the displacement field @xmath33 is of the form velocity = mobility @xmath34 force , i.e. , @xmath35 where the mobility tensor @xmath36 is allowed to depend on the lattice distortion @xmath37 , the tensor @xmath38 represents elastic forces , @xmath39 is the driving force , and @xmath40 a suitable noise source .",
    "our results are for a highly simplified model with the same physics as in ( [ eomgeneral ] ) .",
    "this model , constructed and studied in @xcite , describes the coupled dynamics of _ two _ fields @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( the displacements transverse to and along the drift direction respectively ) , as a function of _ one _ coordinate @xmath43 _ transverse _ to the drift direction @xmath44 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath45 @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are zero - mean , gaussian , spatiotemporally white noise sources .",
    "the equations are invariant under the joint operations @xmath49 . for @xmath50 , ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lr2 ] ) reduce to the erta - kardar @xcite equations for drifting polymers with the larger symmetry @xmath51 ( with or without @xmath52 ) .",
    "the system can distinguish between up and down : there is no invariance under inversion of @xmath42 .",
    "the terms in ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lr2 ] ) involving first spatial derivatives have the following interpretation : a tilt ( @xmath53 ) produces a lateral drift ( at a rate which depends on the density perturbations @xmath54 ) , while the vertical speed depends both on compressions or dilations ( @xmath54 ) , as well as tilts ( @xmath53 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall consider only the case @xmath55 in which case the dispersion relation @xmath56 holds for the linearized version of ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lr2 ] ) and predicts travelling waves at small wavenumber @xmath57 .",
    "the linearly unstable case @xmath58 has been discussed extensively elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the mode coordinates corresponding to ( [ dispersion ] ) are given by @xmath59    as discussed in @xcite , the long - time , large - lengthscale behaviour of the pdes ( [ lr1 ] ) and ( [ lr2 ] ) are expected to be the same as those of a particular two - species ising - kawasaki model in which the jump rate of each species depends on the local density of the other .",
    "we turn next to this discrete model and its dynamics .",
    "[ lattice ]    the lattice model is defined in terms of two sets of variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 which reside on two interpenetrating sublattices with periodic boundary conditions ; the former set occupies the integer sites and the latter the half - integer mid - bond locations of a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath62 sites .",
    "each @xmath63 and @xmath64 is an ising variable taking on values @xmath65 .",
    "they represent discrete versions of the density and tilt fields in the sedimentation problem : if @xmath63 is @xmath66 , there is a particle ( @xmath67 ) at site @xmath68 , and if @xmath69 , there is no particle ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath71 and @xmath72 , implies two values @xmath73 and @xmath74 of the local tilt respectively .",

    "the moves and the corresponding rates are depicted below :    @xmath84    the macroscopic behaviour of the model is determined by the relative values of the rates ; a brief review of the phases and their characteristics appears in @xcite .",

    "this is easy to understand analytically : in this case both the equations have kpz - like nonlinearities in addition to the non - kpz ones .",
    "however , it is easy to see that for both the fields , due to the presence of the waves , in any frame , non - kpz diagrams are less singular than the corresponsing kpz - like diagrams . thus the dominant singular corrections to the response and correlation functions for both the fields are kpz - like , making @xmath336 and @xmath453 .",

    "our results include a demonstration of pairwise balance for certain parameter values and , hence , a proof that the steady state has a product measure in that range of parameters .",
    "most important , we have been able to show that the fields corresponding to the two eigenmodes of the linearized version of the model were characterized by two different dynamic exponents , although the fields themselves are ( nonlinearly ) coupled .",
    "this is the first demonstration of such _ weak dynamical scaling _ in a model with two fully coupled fields ( as distinct from the model of @xcite , where such an effective decoupling was found only in semi - autonomously coupled systems in which one of the fields evolve independently ) .",
    "we have been able to show this numerically , through monte carlo simulations on a lattice model , and analytically , using self - consistent perturbative calculations as well as symmetry arguments , in the corresponding continuum stochastic pdes .",
    "outisde this special subspace of parameter space , the model exhibits normal , strong dynamic scaling .",
