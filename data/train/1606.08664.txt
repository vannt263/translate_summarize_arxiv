    "this spinodal decomposition is accompanied by a domain growth that is believed to be selfsimilar in time ; i.e. , the domain morphology is preserved .",
    "this implies a single time dependent characteristic length which obeys a power law growth @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "competing interactions play an important role in the morphology of phase separation .",
    "they can lead to various domain patterns as e.g. striped lamellar structures , hexagonal arrays of droplets @xcite and clusters @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution in systems with such interactions is governed by the competition between the long range repulsion causing subdivision of domains and the short range attraction resulting in the growth of interface energy .",
    "there has been a great deal of theoretical research of this process carried out in the mean - field framework @xcite . however , there are few particle resolved studies of such systems @xcite , in particular few studies exist addressing the role of competing interactions @xcite .",
    "complex plasmas are composed of a weakly ionized gas and microparticles which are highly charged due to absorption of the ambient electrons and ions @xcite .",
    "binary complex plasmas contain microparticles of two different sizes and constitute a model system which is well suited for studying the kinetics of fluid demixing at the individual particle level : properties of pair interactions , such as the interaction range , can be flexibly tuned .",
    "also the dynamics of particles at short time scales is practically undamped due to the low density in the gas in typical complex plasmas @xcite",
    ".    the prevailing mechanism of interaction between charged microparticles in complex plasmas is electric repulsion @xcite . at large distances",
    "@xmath1 , the electrostatic potential of a particle can be represented in the asymptotic form @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "theory predicts a rich variety of screening mechanisms operating in complex plasmas @xcite .",
    "the shape of @xmath2 can be affected by the plasma absorption on a particle , nonlinearity in plasma particle interactions , ionization loss balance , etc .",
    "recently , it was shown that the plasma production and loss processes can play a crucial role in the long range behavior of @xmath2 @xcite resulting in the emergence of two dominating asymptotes that both have the yukawa form : @xmath3 here @xmath4 indicates effective charge , @xmath5 indicates the length scale for long range ( lr ) and short range ( sr ) interactions respectively .",
    "the screening length ratio is defined as @xmath6 the following discussion will be based on simulations where @xmath7 is varied since it was shown that the lr interactions can significantly enhance demixing @xcite .    to study the possibility of demixing in binary complex plasmas experiments with the pk-3 plus rf discharge chamber @xcite on board the iss were performed earlier .",
    "after the injection of small particles in a stationary cloud of big ones an apparent phase separation was observed accompanied by the formation of a small particle droplet ( supplementary movie s1 of @xcite ) .",
    "these experiments showed the strong tendency of binary complex plasmas to demix at time scales of seconds .",
    "since the early 20th century @xcite minkowski functionals are a prominent tool for morphological data analysis .",
    "only recently the hierarchy of minkowski valuation was extended to tensor valued quantities called minkowski tensors @xcite . minkowski functionals and tensors are sensitive to any @xmath8 point correlation function and thus can quickly give new insights to processes beyond the capability of power spectrum methods as demonstrated for the demixing of a binary complex plasma in this paper .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec - simulation ] describes the simulations on which the minkowski tensor analysis is performed upon . in section [ sec - mts ] methods are presented : voronoi tesselations ( [ subsec - voronoi ] ) , minkowski functionals ( [ subsec - mf ] ) and minkowski tensors ( [ subsec - mt ] ) are introduced .",
    "based on this introduction an isotropy mesasure ( [ subsec - beta ] ) and a symmetry metric ( [ subsec - delta ] ) is derived .",
    "also the previously used power spectrum method [ subsec - ps ] is reviewed .",
    "section [ sec - results ] presents the results obtained by minkwski tensor analysis of the simulation data .",
    "the dynamic range ( [ subsec - dyn ] ) of the minkowski measures , differences in demixed domain size ( [ subsec - diff ] ) for different measures are discussed and hints of universal behaviour ( [ subsec - univ ] ) can be found by analysis of local gradients of the temporal evolution of minkowski measures . finally in section [ sec - conclusion ] conclusions are drawn and a brief outlook on more detailed studies of this process is given .",
    "in order to investigate details of the particle dynamics accompanying the phase separation in binary complex plasmas and compare with theory molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations with the langevin thermostat were employed previously : the growth of the minority phase ( particle species 1 ) domains was analysed for several combinations of short- and long range interactions using a power spectrum method based on the time dependent average structure factor .",

    "the particles interacted via the potential ( [ eq - yukawa ] ) . following simulation parameters ( approximately corresponding to the experiment ) were used : the particle mass density 1.5 g/@xmath13 and diameters @xmath14 @xmath15 m and @xmath16 @xmath15 m , the actual charges @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the friction coefficients @xmath19 s@xmath20 and @xmath21 s@xmath20 , the sr ( debye - hckel ) screening length @xmath22 m , the mean interparticle distance @xmath23  mm , and the temperature @xmath24 ev .",

    "an alternative approach for quantifying local structure is provided by the analysis of the voronoi diagram .",
    "the voronoi diagram is the partition of space into the same number of convex cells as there are particles in the packing .",

    "they are nonlinear measures sensitive to higher order correlations .",
    "known applications are e.g. curvature energy of membranes @xcite , order parameter in turing patterns @xcite , density functional theory for fluids ( as hard balls or ellipsoids ) @xcite , testing point distributions ( find clusters , filaments , underlying pointprocess ) or searching for non - gaussian signatures in the cmb @xcite",

    "this might be another hint to the fact that the higher rank tensor analysis utilizes structural information beyond the mere volume information needed to calculate the domain size .",

    "<S> a molecular dynamics simulation of the demixing process of a binary complex plasma is analysed and the role of distinct interaction potentials is discussed by using morphological minkowski tensor analysis of the minority phase domain growth in a demixing simulated binary complex plasma . </S>",
    "<S> these minkowski tensor methods are compared with previous results that utilized a power spectrum method based on the time - dependent average structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the minkowski tensor methods are superior to the previously used power spectrum method in the sense of higher sensitivity to changes in domain size . by analysis of the slope of the temporal evolution of minkowski tensor measures qualitative differences between the case of particle interaction with a single length scale compared to particle interactions with two different length scales ( dominating long range interaction ) </S>",
    "<S> are revealed . </S>",
    "<S> after proper scaling the graphs for the two length scale scenario coincide , pointing towards universal behaviour . the qualitative difference in demixing scenarios </S>",
    "<S> is evidenced by distinct demixing behaviour : in the long range dominated cases demixing occurs in two stages . at first neighbouring particles </S>",
    "<S> agglomerate then domains start to merge in cascades . </S>",
    "<S> however in the case of only one interaction length scale only agglomeration but no merging of domains can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> thus , minkowski tensor analysis are likely to become a useful tool for further investigation of this ( and other ) demixing processes . </S>",
    "<S> it is capable to reveal ( nonlinear ) local topological properties , probing deeper than ( linear ) global power spectrum analysis , however still providing easily interpretable results founded on a solid mathematical framework . </S>"
