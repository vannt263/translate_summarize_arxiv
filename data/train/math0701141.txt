    "_ discrete tomography _ is concerned with the inverse problem of retrieving information about some discrete object from ( generally noisy ) information about its incidences with certain query sets .",
    "a typical example is the _ reconstruction _ of a finite point set from its line sums in a small number of directions .",
    "more precisely , a ( _ discrete parallel _ ) _ x - ray _ of a finite subset of euclidean @xmath5-space @xmath6 in direction @xmath2 gives the number of points in the set on each line in @xmath6 parallel to @xmath2 . in the classical setting , motivated by crystals , the positions to be determined live on the square lattice @xmath7 or , more generally , on arbitrary lattices @xmath8 in @xmath6 , where @xmath9 .",
    "( here , a subset @xmath10 of @xmath11 is said to _ live on _ a subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath11 when its difference set @xmath13 is a subset of @xmath12 . ) in fact , many of the problems in discrete tomography have been studied on @xmath7 , the classical planar setting of discrete tomography ; see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite . in the longer run , by also having other structures than perfect crystals in mind , one has to take into account wider classes of sets , or at least significant deviations from the lattice structure . as an intermediate step between periodic and random ( or amorphous ) delone sets ( defined below ) , we consider systems of _ aperiodic order _ , more precisely , of so - called _ model sets _ ( or _ mathematical quasicrystals _ ) , which are commonly accepted as a good mathematical model for quasicrystalline structures in nature  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to know whether these sets behave like lattices as far as discrete tomography is concerned .",
    "the main motivation for our interest in the discrete tomography of model sets comes from the physical existence of quasicrystals that can be described as aperiodic model sets together with the demand of materials science to reconstruct three - dimensional ( quasi)crystals or planar layers of them from their images under quantitative _ high resolution transmission electron microscopy _ ( hrtem ) in a small number of directions .",
    "in fact , in  @xcite a technique is described , based on hrtem , which can effectively measure the number of atoms lying on lines parallel to certain directions ; it is called quantitem ( quantitative analysis of the information coming from transmission electron microscopy ) . at present",
    ", the measurement of the number of atoms lying on a line can only be achieved for some crystals ; see  @xcite .",
    "however , it is reasonable to expect that future developments in technology will improve this situation .",
    "whether or not one has future applications in materials science in mind , the starting point will always be a specific structure model .",
    "this means that the specific type of the ( quasi)crystal is given ( see  @xcite for the concept ) , and one is confronted with the @xmath1-ray data of an unknown finite subset of it .",
    "this is the correct analogue of starting with translates of @xmath14 in the classical setting .    here",
    ", our investigation of the discrete tomography of systems with aperiodic order will be restricted to the study of two - dimensional systems .",
    "fortunately , solving the problems of discrete tomography for two - dimensional systems with aperiodic order also lies at the heart of solving the corresponding problems in three dimensions .",
    "this is due to the fact that model sets possess , as it is the case for lattices , a dimensional hierarchy , meaning that any model set in @xmath5 dimensions can be sliced into model sets of dimension @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , we consider a well - known class of _ planar _ model sets which can be described in algebraic terms .",
    "it will be a nice property of this class of planar model sets that it contains , as a special case , arbitrary translates of the square lattice @xmath7 , which corresponds to the classical planar setting of discrete tomography .",
    "let us become more specific . by using the minkowski representation of algebraic number fields ,",
    "we introduce , for @xmath16 , the corresponding class of _ cyclotomic model sets _",
    "@xmath17 which live on @xmath18}$ ] , where @xmath19 is a primitive @xmath20th root of unity in @xmath21 , e.g. , @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath23-module @xmath18}$ ] is the ring of integers in the @xmath20th cyclotomic field @xmath24 , and , for @xmath25 , when viewed as a subset of the plane , is dense , whereas cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 are _ delone sets _ , i.e. , they are uniformly discrete and relatively dense .",
    "in fact , model sets are even _",
    "meyer sets _ , meaning that also @xmath26 is uniformly discrete ; see  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , except the cyclotomic model sets living on @xmath18}$ ] with @xmath27 ( these are exactly the translations of the square and the triangular lattice , respectively ) , cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 are _ aperiodic _ , meaning that they have no translational symmetries at all .",
    "well - known examples are the planar model sets with @xmath28-fold cyclic symmetry that are associated with the square tiling ( @xmath29 ) , the triangle tiling ( @xmath30 ) , the ammann - beenker tiling ( @xmath31 ) , the tbingen triangle tiling ( @xmath32 ) and the shield tiling ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "note that orders @xmath34 and @xmath35 occur as standard cyclic symmetries of genuine quasicrystals  @xcite , which are basically stacks of planar aperiodic layers",
    ".    in general , the _ reconstruction problem _ of discrete tomography can possess rather different solutions .",
    "this leads to the investigation of the corresponding _ uniqueness problem _ , i.e. , the ( unique ) _ determination _ of finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 by @xmath1-rays in a small number of suitably prescribed directions . for practical reasons , only @xmath1-rays in @xmath0-directions , i.e. , directions parallel to non - zero elements of the difference set @xmath26 of @xmath0 , are permitted .",
    "we say that a subset @xmath36 of the set of all finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 is determined by the @xmath1-rays in a finite set @xmath37 of directions if different sets @xmath38 and @xmath39 in @xmath36 have different @xmath1-rays , i.e. , if there is a direction @xmath40 such that the @xmath1-rays of @xmath38 and @xmath39 in direction @xmath2 differ .    without the restriction to @xmath0-directions , one can prove that the finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 can be determined by one @xmath1-ray ( proposition  [ irratdir ] ) .",
    "in fact , it turns out that any @xmath1-ray in a non-@xmath0-direction is suitable for this purpose .",
    "however , in practice ( hrtem ) , @xmath1-rays in non-@xmath0-directions are meaningless since the resolution coming from such @xmath1-rays would not be good enough to allow a quantitative analysis ",
    "neighbouring lines are not sufficiently separated .",
    "proposition  [ m+1 ] demonstrates that the finite sets @xmath38 of cardinality less than or equal to some @xmath41 in a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 are determined by any set of @xmath42 @xmath1-rays in pairwise non - parallel @xmath0-directions .",
    "however , in practice , one is interested in the determination of finite sets by @xmath1-rays in a small number of directions since after about @xmath43 to @xmath44 images taken by hrtem , the object may be damaged or even destroyed by the radiation energy . observing that the typical atomic structures to be determined comprise about @xmath45 to @xmath46 atoms",
    ", one realizes that the last result is not practical at all .",
    "in fact , it is also shown that any fixed number of @xmath1-rays in @xmath0-directions is insufficient to determine the entire class of finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 ( proposition  [ source ] ) .    in view of this , it is necessary to impose some restriction in order to obtain positive uniqueness results .",
    "as a first option , we restrict the set of finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 under consideration , i.e. , we consider for every @xmath47 the class of _ bounded _ subsets of @xmath0 with diameter less than @xmath48 . since @xmath0 is uniformly discrete , bounded subsets of @xmath0 are finite",
    "it is shown that , for all @xmath47 and for all cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 , there are two non - parallel prescribed @xmath0-directions such that the bounded subsets of @xmath0 with diameter less than @xmath48 are determined , among all such subsets of @xmath0 , by their @xmath1-rays in these directions ( corollary  [ coromod ] ) .",
    "in fact , in theorem  [ bounded ] , it is shown that the corresponding result holds for arbitrary delone sets @xmath49 , @xmath9 , of _ finite local complexity _ , the latter meaning that the difference set @xmath26 is closed and discrete .",
    "thereby , also the case of translates of lattices @xmath8 in @xmath11 , @xmath9 , is included ( corollary  [ bounded2 ] ) . moreover , even the corresponding results for orthogonal projections on orthogonal complements of @xmath50-dimensional ( respectively , @xmath51-dimensional ) subspaces generated by elements of @xmath26 ( resp .",
    ", @xmath52 ) hold ; the multiplicity information coming along with @xmath1-rays is not needed .",
    "unfortunately , these results are limited in practice because , in general , one can not make sure that all the directions which are used yield images of high enough resolution .",
    "as a second option , we restrict the set of finite subsets of a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 by considering the class of _ convex _ subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "they are finite sets @xmath4 whose convex hulls contain no new points of @xmath0 , i.e. , finite sets @xmath4 with @xmath53 . in theorem  [ main1 ] , it is shown that there are four pairwise non - parallel prescribed @xmath0-directions such that the convex subsets of any cyclotomic model set @xmath0 living on @xmath18}$ ] are determined , among all convex subsets of @xmath0 , by their @xmath1-rays in these directions .",
    "it is further shown that three pairwise non - parallel @xmath0-directions never suffice for this purpose , whereas _ any _ seven pairwise non - parallel @xmath0-directions which satisfy a certain relation ( see below for details ) have the property that the convex subsets of any cyclotomic model set @xmath0 are determined , among all convex subsets of @xmath0 , by their @xmath1-rays in these directions .",
    "it is also demonstrated that , in a sense , the number seven can not be reduced to six in the latter result .",
    "these results heavily depend on a massive restriction of the set of @xmath0-directions .",
    "we shall also remove this restriction and present explicit results in the case of the important subclass of cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 with co - dimension @xmath54 , i.e. , cyclotomic model sets living on @xmath18}$ ] , where @xmath55 . here",
    ", by using @xmath56-adic valuations , we are able to present a more suitable analysis which shows that uniqueness will be provided by any set of four @xmath0-directions whose slopes ( suitably ordered ) yield a cross ratio that does not map under the field norm of the field extension @xmath57 to a certain _ finite set _ of rational numbers ( theorem  [ main2 ] ) .",
    "( it will turn out that these cross ratios are indeed elements of the maximal real subfield @xmath58 of the @xmath20th cyclotomic field @xmath59 . )",
    "it is also shown that , by the same analysis , similar results can be obtained for arbitrary cyclotomic model sets ( theorem  [ main3 ] ) . in the case of cyclotomic model sets with co - dimension @xmath54 , we shall be able to present sets of four @xmath0-directions which provide uniqueness and yield images of rather high resolution in the quantitative hrtem of the corresponding ( aperiodic ) cyclotomic model sets , the latter making these results look promising .",
    "a major task in achieving the above results involves examining so - called @xmath37-_polygons _ in cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 , which exhibit a weak sort of regularity . in the context of @xmath37-polygons , the question for affinely regular polygons in the plane with all their vertices in a fixed cyclotomic model set @xmath0 arises rather naturally .",
    "chrestenson  @xcite has shown that any ( planar ) regular polygon whose vertices are contained in @xmath60 for some @xmath9 must have @xmath61 or @xmath62 vertices .",
    "more generally , gardner and gritzmann  @xcite have characterized the _",
    "affinely _ regular lattice polygons , i.e. , images of non - degenerate regular polygons under a non - singular affine transformation @xmath63 whose vertices are contained in @xmath64 .",
    "it turned out that these are precisely the affinely regular triangles , parallelograms and hexagons .",
    "clearly , their result remains valid when one replaces the square lattice @xmath64 by the triangular lattice @xmath65 $ ] , since the latter is the image of the first under an invertible linear transformation of the plane . observing that both the square and triangular lattice are examples of rings of integers @xmath18}$ ] in cyclotomic fields @xmath66 , one can ask for a generalization of the above result to all these objects , viewed as @xmath23-modules in the plane . using standard results from algebra and algebraic number theory",
    ", we provide a characterization in terms of a simple divisibility condition ( theorem  [ th1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that our characterization of affinely regular polygons remains valid when restricted to the corresponding class of cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 ( corollary  [ th1mod ] ) .    as a third option",
    ", we consider the interactive technique of _ successive determination _ , introduced by edelsbrunner and skiena  @xcite for continuous @xmath1-rays , in the case of aperiodic cyclotomic model sets , in which the information from previous @xmath1-rays may be used in deciding the direction for the next @xmath1-ray .",
    "here , it is shown that the finite subsets of any cyclotomic model set @xmath0 can be successively determined by @xmath1-rays in two non - parallel @xmath0-directions .",
    "in fact , it is shown that , for @xmath16 , the finite subsets of the ring of cyclotomic integers @xmath18}$ ] can be successively determined by @xmath1-rays in two non - parallel @xmath18}$]-directions , i.e. , directions parallel to a non - zero element of @xmath18}$ ] ( theorem  [ mainsucdet ] ) .",
    "again , the corresponding results do even hold for orthogonal projections on orthogonal complements of @xmath50-dimensional subspaces generated by elements of @xmath26 ; the multiplicity information coming alsong with @xmath1-rays is again not needed .",
    "unfortunately , these results are again limited in practice because , in general , one can not make sure that all the directions which are used yield images of high enough resolution .",
    "previous studies have focussed on the ` anchored ' case that the underlying ground set is located in a linear space , i.e. , in a space with a specified location of the origin .",
    "the @xmath1-ray data is then taken with respect to this localization .",
    "note that the rotational orientation of a ( quasi)crystalline probe in an electron microscope can rather easily be done in the diffraction mode , prior to taking images in the high - resolution mode , though , in general , a natural choice of a translational origin is _ not _ possible .",
    "this problem has its origin in the practice of quantitative hrtem since , in general , the @xmath1-ray information does not allow us to locate the examined sets .",
    "we believe that , in order to obtain applicable results , one has to deal with this ` non - anchored ' case .    in discussing inverse problems , it is important to distinguish between determination and reconstruction .",
    "the problem of reconstructing finite subsets of cyclotomic model sets @xmath0 given @xmath1-rays in _ two _ @xmath0-directions is treated in  @xcite . there",
    ", it is shown that , for a large class of cyclotomic model sets , this problem can be solved in polynomial time in the real ram - model of computation .",
    "for corresponding results in the lattice case , see  @xcite .",
    "note that this work provides a generalization of well - known results , obtained by gardner and gritzmann  @xcite for the ` anchored ' case of fixed translates of lattices @xmath8 in @xmath11 , @xmath9 , to the class of cyclotomic model sets . additionally , we shall present results which deal with the ` non - anchored ' case described above .",
    "several of our proofs are only a slight modification of the proofs from  @xcite . the key role in this text is played by lemma  [ dilate ] , which rests on a result from the theory of _ pisot - vijayaraghavan _ numbers  @xcite , and @xmath56-adic valuations .",
