    "the standard model of elementary particle physics is remarkably successful in describing physics up to a scale of the order of several hundred gev .",
    "still it faces a number of shortcomings , such as the abundance of parameters and their origin , which become particularly prominent in flavor physics or neutrino physics .",
    "in addition , there are two problems that appear to point more strongly to the fact that the standard model can not be a fundamental theory valid for arbitrarily short distance scales : first , the problem of triviality of the scalar and abelian gauge sector , and second , the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "let us start with the hierarchy problem .",
    "if one assumes that the standard model is valid up to some high scale @xmath4 ( e.g. , a scale of grand unification , @xmath5 , or even the planck scale ) , one is immediately confronted with two immensely different scales in the theory  the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "a realization of this enormous hierarchy in the context of the standard model requires a highly exceptional choice of parameters ( `` fine - tuning '' ) .",
    "this can be seen from the quadratic renormalization of the scalar mass term in the higgs sector which naively receives corrections of the order @xmath7 when quantum fluctuations between @xmath4 and @xmath8 are integrated out .",
    "thus @xmath9 at the uv scale must be extremely fine - tuned in order to cancel most of the quantum corrections and produce a higgs which is much lighter than @xmath4 .",
    "it should be stressed that the hierarchy problem is not a problem of principle , but rather a problem of likeliness .",
    "furthermore , it is sufficient that a suitable renormalized parameter at the scale @xmath4 be close to a particular critical value , i.e. , ( partial ) fixed point .",
    "no fine - tuning `` order by order '' is necessary in a suitable renormalization group treament @xcite .",
    "also the existence of the ( partial ) fixed point is related to an enhanced ( approximate ) dilatation symmetry of the quantum system and therefore natural . nevertheless , the necessity of an explanation for a `` close - to - critical value '' at @xmath4 remains .",
    "triviality of the scalar and the abelian sector is a fundamental problem .",
    "if we require a theory to be valid up to arbitrarily high momentum scales , we have to take the limit @xmath10 .",
    "trivial quantum field theories become noninteracting in this limit , since their renormalized couplings vanish .",
    "viewed differently , if we start , for instance , with an interacting higgs sector at low energies , the ( perturbative ) running of scalar coupling approaches a singularity ( landau pole ) , signaling the possible break - down of the theory and the onset of new physics .",
    "triviality in the flow of a renormalized coupling that is observed experimentally at a nonzero value experimentally unequivocally means that the standard model can not be continued to arbitrarily short distances .",
    "this obvious shortcoming of a `` fundamental standard model '' is often not considered as a major problem in practice : unification with gravity suggests that the standard model has to be extended at the planck scale anyhow .    in many attempts at formulating theories beyond the standard model ,",
    "the hierarchy and triviality problem are not considered simultaneously .",
    "for the hierarchy problem , new physical mechanisms are invoked to already operate on a low scale , say @xmath11(tev ) , in order to strongly modify the renormalization group ( rg ) behavior of the system .",
    "prominent examples of these scenarios are supersymmetry @xcite , technicolor @xcite or the `` little higgs '' @xcite .",
    "common to all of these is the need of additional physical parameters instead of their desired reduction . as the main hope",
    ", no parameter needs to be fine - tuned at the high scale @xmath4 and the system is ( marginally ) rg stable towards the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "the triviality problem is finally circumvented by embedding the standard model in a nontrivial theory ( as the abelian u(1 ) is embedded in a nonabelian gauge group of a gut ) , or by referring to a framework that goes far beyond quantum field theory , such as string theory .",
    "this letter represents an attempt at tackling these problems from a different viewpoint . instead of modeling new physics with additional parameters at the tev scale ( ir viewpoint )",
    ", we are looking for quantum field theoretic systems defined at a high scale @xmath4 that have the potential to remain rg stable down to low scales ( uv viewpoint ) .",
    "the desired systems should not have more relevant parameters than the standard model ; in particular , no new parameters should be required for the system to become unstable near the fermi scale ( as is the case , e.g. , with soft - breaking terms in susy theories ) .",
    "the hierarchy problem is deeply rooted in the scalar nature of the higgs sector . in the present work",
    "we avoid the concept of fundamental scalars and consider only fermionic matter fields .",
    "the higgs scalar is then interpreted as a fermionic bound state , whereas the higgs condensate arises from dynamical symmetry breaking accompanied by a condensation of fermion bilinears .",
    "this behavior is well known from the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and systems alike , which have already frequently been used for modeling the higgs sector , as in topquark - condensation scenarios @xcite .",
    "in fact , from a model - building point of view , our systems closely resemble those with topquark condensation .",
    "however , we focus on the uv behavior , which is an inherently nonperturbative problem .    at first sight",
    ", it seems that fermionic self - interactions even worsen the theoretical objections , since such couplings are not perturbatively renormalizable in @xmath12 dimensional spacetime .",
    "this means that a quantum theory can not consistently be constructed by an expansion around zero coupling ( gauian fixed point ) .",
    "nevertheless , perturbative renormalizability is not a necessary criterion for constructing an interacting field theory .",
    "also perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories can be fundamental and mathematically consistent down to arbitrarily small length scales , as proposed in weinberg s `` asymptotic safety '' scenario @xcite .",
    "this scenario assumes the existence of a non - gauian ( = nonzero ) uv fixed point under the renormalization group ( rg ) operation at which the continuum limit can be taken .",
    "the theory is `` nonperturbatively renormalizable '' in wilson s sense .",
    "if the non - gauian fixed point is ir repulsive only for a finite number of renormalized couplings , the rg trajectories along which the theory can flow for @xmath13 are labeled by only a finite number of physical parameters .",
    "then the theory is as predictive as any perturbatively renormalizable theory , and high - energy physics can be well separated from low - energy physics without tuning a large number of parameters . finally , the triviality problem is absent by construction .",
    "the issue of the gauge hierarchy problem is related to the relevant couplings and the associated anomalous dimensions . for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider one particular small deviation is an eigenvector of the stability matrix .",
    "we take @xmath14 to be a dimensionless renormalized parameter . in the case of a mass @xmath15 , this corresponds to @xmath16 . ]",
    "@xmath14 from the fixed point which depends on the renormalization scale @xmath17 according to a generalized `` anomalous dimensions '' @xmath18 , @xmath19 the solution @xmath20 implies for large positive @xmath18 that @xmath14 must be tiny at @xmath4 if it is of order one for @xmath21 .",
    "this is the fine - tuning problem . for positive @xmath18 ( not very close to zero ) @xmath14",
    "is called relevant parameter and we conclude that a fine - tuning problem is connected to every relevant parameter .",
    "( we note that for a perturbative expansion the exact location of the fixed point may depend on the order of the approximation .",
    "also @xmath18 may be expressed in a perturbative series and the right - hand side may contain higher powers of @xmath14 . all this does not affect the conclusion that precisely one small parameter @xmath22 is needed ( one fine - tuning ) for every relevant coupling . ) on the other hand , if @xmath18 is very close to zero or vanishes ( in this case @xmath14 may depend logarithmically on @xmath17 ) , @xmath14 is called a marginal coupling .",
    "( an example is the gauge coupling @xmath23 near a fixed point with @xmath24 . )",
    "no extreme fine - tuning is needed for marginal couplings , since @xmath25 and @xmath22 are of a similar order of magnitude . in consequence , a model with only marginal couplings has no gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "within the standard model , this type of solution for the gauge hierarchy problem has been proposed in @xcite . known examples for the quantum field theories with only marginal couplings ( besides the irrelevant ones ) are four - dimensional pure non - abelian gauge theories near the gauian fixed point or two - dimensional scalar theories with global u(1 ) symmetry near the fixed point corresponding to the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition with essential scaling @xcite . in statistical physics , a fixed point with only marginal directions can be associated to `` self - organized criticality '' .    in this work",
    ", we analyze a class of models with four - fermion self - interactions with gauge and flavor symmetry . in order to quantize the systems in a nonperturbative framework",
    ", we employ the exact renormalization group formulated in terms of a flow equation for the effective average action @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 the latter is a free - energy functional that interpolates between the bare action @xmath28 and the full quantum effective action @xmath29 . here",
    ", @xmath30 denotes a to some extent arbitrary regulator function that specifies the details of the momentum - shell integrations . with the flow equation  ( [ erg ] ) , it is possible to analyze the space of action functionals and its fixed - point structure , in order to look for quantizable and renormalizable theories .",
    "these correspond to zeros of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ erg ] ) with a suitable finite number of relevant parameters , characterizing the small deviations from the fixed point .",
    "equation  ( [ erg ] ) is a functional differential equation , since the right - hand side contains the second functional derivative @xmath31 ( the full inverse propagator ) .",
    "approximate solutions can be found by suitable truncations of the space of actions .    within the approximation of point - like four - fermion interactions",
    ", we indeed find a variety of non - gauian fixed points that give rise to new universality classes of interacting quantum field theories and solve the triviality problem in the higgs sector . concerning the hierarchy problem , however ,",
    "we show that these fermionic theories are at least as ir unstable as a scalar higgs sector , so that a very precise choice of initial conditions remains necessary ( fine - tuning ) .    upon the inclusion of gauge field dynamics ,",
    "the picture does not change qualitatively as long as the gauge couplings remain perturbatively small .",
    "the influence of the gauge fields on the fermionic sector is subdominant .",
    "moreover , the fermionic self - interactions do not modify the leading - order running of the gauge couplings , as we show with the aid of modified ward - takahashi identities . as a consequence",
    ", fermionic self - interactions can not cure the triviality problem of the abelian u(1 ) sector , e.g. , by rendering this gauge coupling asymptotically free .",
    "while we have not found a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem so far , we reveal instructive general aspects of the structure and influence of fermionic self - interactions in models with flavor and gauge symmetry .",
    "our findings may be taken as a hint toward possible directions in the search for a satisfactory renormalizable standard model without a fundamental higgs scalar . as a rather speculative example",
    ", we demonstrate in the appendix how the possible existence of a non - gauian fixed point in the u(1 ) gauge coupling could strongly influence and even stabilize the rg behavior of a fermionic higgs sector towards the infrared .",
    "in the present work , we consider a theory of fermions with self - interactions as well as gauge - field interactions .",
    "let us start with all possible interactions that are compatible with a @xmath32 gauge symmetry and a chiral @xmath33 flavor symmetry for @xmath34 fermion species .",
    "the @xmath35 simulates the non - abelian , asymptotically free part of the standard model gauge group , while the @xmath36 models the abelian part with its triviality problem . for simplicity",
    ", the gauge fields are assumed to couple to left- and right - handed fermions in the same way with the same charges . in comparison to the standard model",
    ", we have neglected the electroweak @xmath37 chiral gauge interactions and the differences between the hyper charges under the @xmath36 .",
    "the reason for concentrating on the strong @xmath35 gauge group instead of the electroweak @xmath37 is the following : if an ir stabilized system exists , we expect the strongest gauge interaction to be a good candidate for a destabilizing influence near the fermi scale . even though symmetry breaking first affects the electroweak sector , it may be caused by fermionic self - interactions in combination with the strong gauge sector .",
    "an inclusion of the remaining standard model building blocks is , in principle , straightforward : one should add the weak gauge interactions and consider additional possible four - fermion interactions which are consistent with the reduced flavor symmetries and the gauge symmetries .",
    "the number of possible four - fermion interactions increases very substantially , however , owing to the lack of parity symmetry and reduced flavor symmetry . for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40",
    "our model corresponds to the standard model in the limit of vanishing weak and hypercharge gauge couplings .",

    "if the factor in square brackets in these terms is positive for a given @xmath118 , the corresponding gauge coupling seems to be asymptotically free .",
    "this would offer a solution to the triviality problem of the u(1 ) sector .",

    "the increase of @xmath158 is associated with a decrease of the scalar mass term , which eventually drops below zero and thus gives rise to ssb .",

    ", the fermionic self - interactions do not modify the leading - order running of the gauge couplings , as we have shown with the help of modified ward - takahashi identities .",
    "this inhibits a solution of the triviality problem in the abelian gauge sector at the gauian fixed point .    in summary ,",
    "we find that a fermionic higgs sector has the potential to be a truly renormalizable theory , removing the triviality problem of a fundamental scalar higgs . however , we have not been able to identify a consistent resolution of the hierarchy problem within our truncation . in a realistic scenario comprising the full standard - model phenomenology ,",
    "the number of physical parameters in our model would be comparable to that of the standard model .",
    "the precise number will depend on the particular choice of the non - gauian @xmath161 fixed point and its number of rg - relevant directions . whether the number of physical parameters can even drop below that of the standard model then depends on the universality class associated with the chosen fixed point .",
    "a determination of the physically acceptable universality classes requires an analysis of their symmetry - breaking properties .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present truncation in which all couplings diverge at the symmetry - breaking scale .",
    "these low - energy properties can , however , easily be derived from an analysis of the condensing bilinear fermion channels using partial bosonization under the flow as described in @xcite , @xcite .    at this point ,",
    "let us comment on the stability of our results under a change of the truncation .",
    "we have checked that higher fermionic self - interactions do not modify our results in the point - like limit .",
    "they neither remove the @xmath161 fixed points nor represent nonperturbatively renormalizable couplings themselves ( the latter would increase the number of physical parameters ) . concerning the gauge sector ,",
    "we have studied a number of non - minimal fermion  gauge - field couplings .",
    "none of them turns out to influence the leading - order running of the gauge couplings in the weak - coupling regime ; the argument proceeds similarly to the one given in sect .",

    "the uv fixed points that we find for the fermionic couplings may be viewed as a generalization of those uv fixed points that are known from large-@xmath34 studies of simple four - fermion interactions in @xmath162 dimensions @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "four - fermion interactions can be renormalized order by order in a @xmath163 expansion despite its seeming perturbative nonrenormalizability .",
    "our truncation exhibits these fixed points in all dimensions @xmath164 .",
    "however , we suspect that at least far beyond four dimensions the fixed points may be an artefact of the truncation , since here even the induced yukawa couplings between fermions and composite bosonic fluctuations become rg irrelevant by power - counting arguments .",

    "these yukawa couplings are rg marginal by power - counting : hence @xmath103 appears to be the critical dimension .",
    "large-@xmath34 arguments are indeed in favor of logarithmic triviality in @xmath103 , a picture that receives some support from lattice simulations with staggered fermions for a simple njl model @xcite .",
    "however , the large-@xmath34 approximation neglects the anomalous dimension of the fermion which , even if tiny , can have a large effect by changing marginal - irrelevant into marginal - relevant operators .",
    "since gauge interactions also contribute to the fermionic anomalous dimension , purely fermionic lattice studies can not be conclusive for the models considered in the present work .",
    "therefore , @xmath103 lattice investigations with four - fermion as well as gauge interactions would be desirable and may indeed be accessible with recently developed algorithms @xcite .    in order to pursue this question",
    "further within the flow equation framework , we have to go beyond the point - like limit .",
    "if the qualitative picture developed so far in this simple truncation turns out to be incomplete , we expect that strong modifications might arise from the full momentum structure of the interaction",
    ". it may well be that our non - gauian @xmath161 fixed points are only a projection of a more general momentum - dependent interaction onto the point - like limit .",
    "if so , it is natural to speculate that a strongly momentum - dependent wave - function renormalization of the fermions could even induce a large fermionic anomalous dimension . then it would be conceivable that the latter stabilizes the fermionic flow towards the infrared .",

    ", we would like to demonstrate that the existence of a non - gauian fixed point in the abelian gauge coupling has the potential to solve both problems simultaneously .",
    "although the @xmath72 function for the abelian coupling @xmath165 as derived from the mwti does not furnish a non - gauian fixed point via the direct four - fermion contribution , such a fixed point might be induced by the strong - coupling behavior of the gauge interactions or a combination of strong gauge and four - fermion interactions .",
