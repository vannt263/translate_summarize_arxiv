    "the propagation of collective excitations in periodically structured media has been recognized long ago as a fundamentally important topic of condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been understood that many condensed media , where the intrinsic dynamics is very complex , may be effectively  simulated \" by rarefied quantum gases , for which it is much easier to predict and observe fundamental dynamical effects @xcite . in the latter context ,",
    "the role of the periodic structure is commonly played by optical - lattice ( ol ) potentials @xcite . in particular , the use of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in ols makes it possible to simulate the propagation of acoustic waves in crystals theoretically @xcite - two - modes and in a direct experiment @xcite .",
    "a deep ol potential splits the condensate into an array of droplets trapped in local potential wells , which are weakly coupled with nearest neighbors by tunneling of atoms across potential barriers . in this case",
    ", it is natural to approximate the global bec wave function by a superposition of wavelets of locally trapped atoms , which resemble well - known wannier modes that can be used an alternative basis instead of bloch waves @xcite . on the basis of this expansion",
    ", the reduction of the underlying full gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) to its discrete version ( dgpe ) has been rigorously derived in several works @xcite and reviewed in ref .",
    "the derivation of the dgpe was further extended to the model with a relatively strong contact nonlinearity , when the onsite nonlinearity in the resulting discrete equation is nonpolynomial @xcite .",
    "a significant extension of the variety of dynamical effects in atomic becs is provided by long - range dipole - dipole interactions ( ddis ) .",
    "basic and more sophisticated properties of dipole condensates were predicted theoretically @xcite , which was followed by the creation of such condensates in vapors of @xmath0cr @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of this setting is buttressed by the possibility to vary the relative strength of the ddi and contact interactions by means of the feshbach resonance affecting the scattering length for colliding chromium atoms @xcite .",
    "results obtained in this area have been reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "further progress in the experimental work has recently resulted in the creation of dipolar condensates with the strongest possible atomic ddis in @xmath1dy @xcite .",
    "also promising is the work with erbium @xcite , and with gases composed of molecules carrying electric dipole moments hetero .",
    "ols provide a powerful set of tools for the studies of dipolar becs .",
    "in particular , the stabilization and destabilization of the condensate , trapped in deep ols , by ddi was demonstrated theoretically and experimentally cr - ol .",
    "it was straightforward to generalize the dgpe for this case , which leads to the discrete equation combining the local onsite nonlinearity with the nonlocal nonlinear interaction between the sites , in the one- wannier , wannier2 and two - dimensional ( 2d ) @xcite settings alike .",
    "further , we have recently demonstrated that , in case the uniform ( alias continuous - wave , cw ) state of the dipolar condensate , trapped in a deep periodic potential ( i.e. , the discretized state with equal amplitudes at all sites of the lattice ) , is modulationally unstable , two- and three - period density patterns emerge as energy minimizers , the stability area being very large for the three - period pattern @xcite .",
    "modulated - density solutions are also produced by the dgpe for condensates fragmented by the deep ol potential in the absence of long - range interactions , but in that case they are completely unstable @xcite .",
    "2d supersolid structures supported by the ol in the dipolar bec were predicted too @xcite , and anisotropic ddis may give rise to striped 2d  patterns even in the absence of the lattice @xcite .    beyond the aforementioned detailed studies of static patterns , a physical problem of obvious interest is the study of collective excitations propagating on top of stable states supported by the long - range interactions . in this context ,",
    "a well - known result is the prediction of the roton branch of excitations in the dipolar condensates @xcite .",
    "the subject of the present work is the analysis of excitation modes propagating through the dipolar bec fragmented by the deep ol and , accordingly , modeled by the dgpe including the long - range ddis .",
    "the rapid progress in experimental studies of condensates ( in particular , the development of techniques for in - situ imaging of the condensate dynamics insitu , shammas ) suggests that the direct observation of such modes will become possible , hence the analysis is a subject of direct relevance .",
    "a related promising experimental technique , based on the method of the bragg spectroscopy @xcite , was very recently elaborated for directly measuring phonon dispersion relations in trapped becs @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the most fundamental case of the normal modes excited on top of the stable cw state .",
    "still more challenging situations with the underlying periodically modulated density profiles will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the most essential result of the analysis is that the long - range ddi between condensate droplets gives rise to a high - frequency branch of collective excitations , which emulates the optical - phonon mode well known in condensed - matter physics .",
    "this excitation propagates as a displacement wave in the array of trapped bec droplets , which resembles the dynamics of the frenkel - kontorova model @xcite .",
    "another fundamental branch of the propagating waves represents low - frequency density oscillations of the droplets , which is a counterpart of acoustic phonons in condensed matter .",
    "it is a generalization of the branch which was recently found in the limit of immobile droplets @xcite .",
    "excitation modes similar to those reported here may be expected in other physical settings which feature long - range interactions between elements of a fragmented wave field . in particular , laser illumination of atoms",
    "may induce an effective gravity - like long - range attraction in bec , which , in the combination with the ol , may give rise to a supersolid @xcite .",
    "an example in optics is offered by the light field trapped in an arrayed waveguide embedded into a medium with the nonlocal thermal nonlinearity thermal , which gives rise to a number of patterns in one and two dimensions , as demonstrated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "other possible realizations  of this generic setting in optics may use the nonlocal nonlinearity of liquid crystals @xcite , and an effective nonlocality in semiconductor waveguides induced by the transport of charge carriers @xcite .",
    "the on - site dynamics of the dipolar - bec droplets trapped in local potential wells of the deep ol potential is governed by the dgpe , which includes the onsite cubic nonlinearity and long - range ddi .",
    "following the notation adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the discrete equation is written as @xmath2where @xmath3 is the discrete wave function , @xmath4 are inter - site coupling coefficients proportional to the overlapping integrals between the wannier modes exponentially localized at adjacent sites @xcite - wannier . if the coordinate of the @xmath5-th droplet is taken as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 accounts for its displacements due to the ddis with other droplets ( see fig .

    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the attractive and repulsive ddis , respectively . according to its definition",
    ", @xmath17 may be adjusted by means of the feshbach resonance which affects the strength of the local nonlinearity , and , additionally , by fixing the orientation of the magnetic moments with respect to the system s axis .",
    "the energies of the ddi , and of the trapping of the condensate in the ol potential are @xmath18where @xmath19 is the depth of the periodic potential , hence the motion of each droplet is governed by the newton s equation , @xmath20where @xmath21 is the density of the condensate , so that the mass and momentum of the @xmath5-th droplet are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
