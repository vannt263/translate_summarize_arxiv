    "the existence of neutral non - uniform black string solutions was originally postulated by gregory and laflamme when they discovered the perturbative classical instability of the uniform strings @xcite . by compactifying the axis of rotational symmetry",
    ", the solutions can be stabilised above a critical mass . at the critical mass ,",
    "the marginal mode is static indicating a new branch of solutions with spontaneously broken translational invariance along the compact direction .",
    "the end state of the decay for the unstable compactified uniform strings was supposed to be a compact black hole solution , with spherical spatial horizon topology .",
    "however , horowitz and maeda @xcite argued that the horizon can not ` pinch off ' in a finite affine time , and concluded that the end state should instead be a non - uniform string .",
    "the non - uniform solutions connected to the gregory - laflamme ( g - l ) critical point were then constructed in third order perturbation theory by gubser @xcite , who found that their mass increased with non - uniformity , whilst the asymptotic compactification radius is held constant . in a recent work @xcite",
    "we have shown that the mass of these non - uniform strings is in fact always greater than that of the critical string .",
    "this implies they can not be the product of decay of an unstable uniform string , and the mysterious dynamics of the decay remains an open question . numerical work in progress",
    "may shed light on the product , although the evolution time is not long enough at present @xcite .",
    "other interesting issues are links between classical and thermodynamic stability for the uniform strings @xcite , the classical instability in related spacetimes @xcite , and the phenomenological implications these strings may have in theories with compact extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "some analytic results are known for non - uniform strings @xcite . however , the weyl ansatz which solves 4-dimensional static axisymmetric gravity does not generalise to higher dimensions to give spherical symmetry about an axis @xcite .",
    "interesting work by harmark and obers @xcite has conjectured an ansatz for the general string / black - hole solution that reduces the number of unknown metric functions from three to one , although they could not show its consistency . using this ansatz they conjectured a _",
    "new _ branch of non - uniform string solutions , unrelated to those connected to the g - l critical point .",
    "we term these ` conventional ' non - uniform solutions _ g - l strings _ , and it is these that mostly concern us here .",
    "we term the solutions conjectured to exist by harmark and obers the _ h - o strings_.    using morse theory , kol @xcite has conjectured that the g - l string branch of solutions should connect to the black hole branch ( assuming it actually exists - see @xcite ) via a spatial horizon topology changing solution . in this letter",
    ", we use our numerical solutions for highly non - uniform g - l strings to study the geometry of the horizon , as a function of the minimal sphere radius , whilst keeping the asymptotic radius of compactification fixed .",
    "following gubser we will use the quantity , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the maximum radius of a 3-sphere on the horizon and @xmath2 is the minimum , being the radius at the ` waist ' .",
    "thus @xmath3 is zero for the uniform black string .",
    "we briefly review the numerical method , and then provide evidence that as @xmath4 these solutions are consistent with kol s conjecture , that @xmath5 is the horizon topology changing solution , which connects with the black hole branch .",
    "finally we demonstrate that our solutions can always be written in the form of the harmark and obers ansatz , thereby showing consistency of this ansatz , at least for g - l strings .",
    "we comment on the implication of this for the existance of h - o strings .",
    "the problem of constructing compactified non - uniform string solutions is an elliptic one .",
    "we wish to have an asymptotic product geometry of flat space and an @xmath6 . near the axis of rotational symmetry we wish to impose horizon boundary conditions , with a fixed amount of ` wiggliness ' .",
    "in addition we wish the solutions to be periodic in the axis direction .",
    "the scale invariance of the vacuum einstein equations means that finding the solutions for a fixed @xmath6 size allows all other solutions to be generated simply by scaling .",
    "we first developed numerical methods in @xcite to fully solve the geometry of a star near its upper mass limit on a randall - sundrum brane @xcite .",
    "later in @xcite we extended these methods to the case of the black string . for technical reasons ,",
    "we consider the 6 dimensional black string solution , rather than the 5 dimensional one examined by gubser .",
    "as shown in @xcite , these have the same qualitative thermodynamic behaviour as 5 dimensional strings , to leading order in @xmath3 .",
    "we take the metric , @xmath7 where @xmath8 are functions of @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] is an interval as the string is wrapping an @xmath6 .",
    "this form can always be _ locally _ chosen .",
    "when @xmath11 this reduces to a uniform black string . as found in @xcite , the diagonal form , and residual invariance under @xmath9 conformal transformations results in several important simplifications",
    "firstly , the ` interior ' einstein equations , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 take the form , @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , and the sources @xmath18 depend non - linearly on all the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the form of these equations , or equivalently the lagrangian from which they are derived , allows standard elliptic numerical methods to be employed to solve for @xmath8 given elliptic boundary data .",
    "note that the superspace metric has lorentzian signature , so this is an extremisation problem , rather than a minimisation one .",
    "the second crucial observation is that the remaining einstein equations , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , weighted by the measure @xmath24 , obey an elegant cauchy - riemann relation , @xmath25 provided that the interior equations are satisfied . if , for example , we satisfy @xmath26 on all the boundaries , we need only satisfy @xmath27 at one point and both constraints must then be zero everywhere in the interior .",
    "asymptotically we choose @xmath28 , and thus @xmath29 is the radius of the compactification .",
    "we also enforce the @xmath23 constraint there , and the @xmath22 constraint is automatically true as @xmath30 dependence decays exponentially at large @xmath31 with these boundary conditions .",
    "the third important feature resulting from the @xmath9 conformal invariance is that we are free to choose the boundaries , where we fix data , to be at any coordinate location .",
    "thus we need not include additional information to encode boundary positions .",
    "we take periodic boundary conditions at @xmath32 , and choosing the horizon to be at @xmath33 , compatible with our choice of background string solution , implies that @xmath8 will be finite at the horizon .",
    "horizon boundary conditions are imposed by regularity .",
    "we find @xcite that we must impose @xmath34 constraint is then satisfied , and consequently @xmath35 , as a result of the constraint structure . ] and the constant temperature condition , @xmath36 which ensures @xmath22 is satisfied , and must be integrated along the horizon , giving rise to one parameter , @xmath37 at @xmath38 , as the integration constant , that determines the deformation from the uniform string . from our numerical solutions",
    ", we find a one - to - one relation between @xmath3 and @xmath37 .",
    "relaxation of the interior equations , with the boundary conditions described above , is continued until a convergent solution is found . using elementary numerical methods and moderate resolution and computer time ,",
    "solutions were found for @xmath39 . in figure",
    "[ fig : horizon ] we show the spatial horizon geometry of the most non - uniform solution , embedded into @xmath40 . consistency checks were performed in @xcite ; direct evaluation of the constraints , comparison with third order perturbation theory at small @xmath3 , varying @xmath29 ( which gives scale equivalent solutions ) .",
    "the asymptotic adm mass of the solutions is plotted in figure [ fig : mass ] against @xmath3 .",
    "this can be computed from the asymptotic behaviour of the metric , or from integration of the first law , and the two give good agreement .",
    "for @xmath41 , the difference in the values is approximately @xmath42 . for a detailed discussion of errors ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to assess systematic errors in the method , but it is likely that other data plotted here have similar magnitude errors . from this figure [",
    "fig : mass ] , we concluded that the mass of these non - uniform g - l strings is always larger than the critical string , and for @xmath43 it tends to approximately twice the value of the critical string .",
    "we now consider _ how _",
    "@xmath3 becomes large . for our solutions ,",
    "the maximum value for the metric function @xmath44 occurs at @xmath45 , and the minimum is at @xmath38 , where @xmath46 .",
    "this gives rise to the horizon 3-sphere radii @xmath1 and @xmath2 , plotted in figure [ fig : geom1 ] as a function of @xmath47 , for fixed asymptotic @xmath6 radius , and normalised by the critical uniform string horizon radius .",
    "clearly for @xmath3 to become large , either @xmath48 , or @xmath49 , or both .",
    "it is immediately clear from the figure that @xmath3 becomes large due to @xmath2 shrinking , apparently as @xmath50 for large @xmath3 .",
    "the earlier horizon embedding , figure [ fig : horizon ] , graphically illustrates this , the critical uniform string with the same asymptotic @xmath6 size having unit horizon radius .",
    "thus we find good evidence that @xmath48 as @xmath43 .",
    "taking the black hole branch of solutions , for the same asymptotic compactification radius , and increasing their mass from zero , the black holes will appear less and less like 6 dimensional schwarzschild solutions . at some point ,",
    "the branch of solutions might cease , there could be a point where the horizon topology changes @xcite , the solutions might decompactify along the axis , as occurs for the extremal charged black hole solutions , or the black hole could become highly extended only in the radial direction @xcite . if , as kol suggests , there is a point of topology change and the solutions connect to the g - l non - uniform branch at @xmath5 , so @xmath51 , we would expect a _",
    "finite _ @xmath1 . on the other hand",
    ", if this is not the case , the geometry of the g - l strings may do something quite different as @xmath4 .",
    "an example would be if harmark and obers are correct , and it is a _ different _ branch of non - uniform solutions - the h - o strings - that connect to the black hole solutions , rather than the g - l solutions .",
    "we see from figure [ fig : geom1 ] that @xmath1 does appear to tend to a constant value as @xmath4 .",
    "thus by considering the extrema of the horizon , we find consistency with the idea that the black hole solutions could connect to the non - uniform branch .",
    "let us now consider other geometric quantities , to see if pathologies develop that could spoil this picture .",
    "firstly , whilst we fix the asymptotic length of the @xmath6 , we do not a priori know the proper length along the horizon , @xmath52 , found by integrating @xmath53 at @xmath33 .",
    "we plot this in figure [ fig : geom2 ] , and see that it increases , but appears consistent with tending to a constant as @xmath48 , again being compatible with the solution tending to the limiting black hole solution which can only just ` fit ' into the circle .",
    "note that another possible option would have been finding this horizon length became infinite in the limit , which obviously would not have been compatible with kol s conjecture .",
    "thus we have considered coordinate invariant quantities associated with the @xmath54 metric functions . the remaining metric function @xmath55 forms the coordinate invariant horizon temperature , as @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , and in figure [ fig : geom3 ] , the temperature again appears to tend to a constant .",
    "this is _ crucial _ as we expect this temperature to remain finite if there is a continuous interpolation between black hole and string solutions .",
    "note that finding finite values for both the above quantities is encouraging from a numerical point of view , as at @xmath38 , where the horizon radius is a minimum , we find both @xmath57 and @xmath53 appear to diverge as @xmath4 . obviously we expect the coordinate system to become singular at the topology changing point , and it is good news that such coordinate invariant quantities remain well behaved there .    to summarise",
    ", several geometric quantities appear to have limits as @xmath48 compatible with interpolating to black hole solutions , as conjectured by kol .",
    "we stress that this is by no means a proof . however , the conjecture could easily have been falsified if any of the tested quantities had not behaved in a finite way as @xmath4 , so we do regard it as supporting evidence . assuming kol s picure holds , the values of @xmath58 , @xmath59 and the horizon temperature in the above figures , extrapolated to @xmath4 ,",
    "can then be taken as testable _ predictions _ for the same quantities measured in the largest mass black hole solution .",
    "if , for example , our numerical methods can be modified to explore the black hole branch , we may then _ quantitatively _ test whether the branches could join , even if the topology changing solution can not be numerically constructed explicitly .",
    "we now consider the geometry at the minimum radius 3-sphere of the horizon . a simple scalar measure of curvature is the kretschmann invariant , @xmath60 .",
    "since we are interested in its behaviour at this extremal point of the horizon , @xmath33 , @xmath38 , and @xmath61 there , we may expand to quadratic order in @xmath62 , @xmath63 where @xmath64 for @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . using the interior equations we may solve @xmath67 in terms of @xmath68 , and the constant temperature condition , resulting from the constraints , yields @xmath69 .",
    "we find , @xmath70 at the waist @xmath33 , @xmath71 , choosing units where @xmath72 .",
    "we now know that for this minimal cycle , @xmath73 as @xmath4 ( as @xmath74 ) . from the form of the equation above",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath75 _ must _ diverge in this limit , independent of the behaviour of @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "thus we have shown the curvature at the waist must become singular , provided the solutions exist for large @xmath3 with the boundary conditions we impose , so that the near waist behaviour remains true . assuming that @xmath55 remains finite away from the horizon then implies the @xmath5 solution has a naked singularity at the waist .",
    "this again agrees with kol s picture , who has also suggested that this nakedly singular geometry near the waist may be a cone metric , which we aim to test in future work .",
    "finally , we discuss the metric ansatz proposed by harmark and obers , applied to 6-dimensional neutral black string / hole geometries , namely , @xmath78 where @xmath79 are functions of @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a constant . in @xcite ,",
    "harmark and obers constructed this ansatz based on a coordinate system that ` interpolates ' between the black hole and uniform string solutions .",
    "they also find that @xmath75 can be algebraically eliminated in terms of @xmath82 .",
    "this therefore gives an ansatz containing only one free function , @xmath82 , rather than the usual 3 generally required by static axisymmetry , as in our metric .",
    "of the five independent einstein equations discussed above , one linear combination vanishes , one is used to determine @xmath75 , leaving 3 remaining equations for @xmath82 .",
    "harmark and obers were unable to show that these could be solved consistently , but gave suggestive evidence by considering the consistency of the ansatz at the horizon , and to second order in an asymptotic expansion in @xmath83 .",
    "in fact it is easy to show the 3 einstein equations may be locally consistent , due to the 2 independent components of the contracted bianchi identities .",
    "however , the question of global consistency appears to depend on the explicit existence of solutions . in this section",
    "we exhibit the coordinate transformation that takes our metric coordinate system into the harmark - obers coordinate system .",
    "our metric contains sufficiently many metric functions to parameterise the general solution locally , and thus this coordinate transformation ` locally ' demonstrates the consistency of the harmark - obers ansatz .",
    "however , our numerical solutions indicate that our coordinates are good globally for the g - l strings ( with finite @xmath3 ) , and therefore shows the ` global ' consistency of their ansatz for these solutions .",
    "taking the coordinate transformation , @xmath84 then gives the conditions , @xmath85 for the transformation of to harmark - obers form .",
    "in addition , we require that after the transformation the lapse is the specific function in .",
    "the task is then to understand what @xmath86 solve these equations , and consistently gives only this @xmath83 dependence in the lapse . for this lapse to take the desired form , we would require , @xmath87 to check whether this can be a solution to the coordinate transformation conditions",
    ", we may eliminate @xmath88 from these to give , @xmath89 substituting our required @xmath90 above into this condition , gives a second order equation for @xmath55 which is exactly the interior equation , @xmath91 of .",
    "thus the @xmath90 required by the harmark - obers ansatz is indeed a consistent solution of this coordinate transform , and thus we may transform our metric into the harmark - obers form .",
    "we now consider the positions of the horizon , and periodic boundaries . in our solutions , we have chosen them to be at @xmath33 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we require @xmath92 at the periodic boundaries .",
    "@xmath8 are finite on the horizon , and go to zero at large @xmath31 .",
    "together , these facts imply that in the @xmath80 coordinates , the horizon is at @xmath93 , and the periodic boundaries are at constant @xmath94 . with a suitable choice of data for @xmath88 in the transformation above",
    "we may pick @xmath95 to be one periodic boundary . to find the second periodic boundary location ,",
    "say @xmath96 , one must then use @xmath75 and to give , @xmath97 at large @xmath31 , @xmath98 only have @xmath31 power law dependence , the @xmath30 dependence having decayed away exponentially .",
    "one integrates to find @xmath99 at large @xmath31 , which gives @xmath100 at @xmath38 . as @xmath28 as @xmath101",
    "so @xmath79 also vanish there and thus @xmath100 is the proper asymptotic circle length .",
    "it is now important that we may choose @xmath81 so that @xmath102 ie .",
    "choosing @xmath81 correctly ` undoes ' the global scaling that will generically occur in this coordinate transformation .",
    "what is crucial is that for fixed @xmath103 , this means that @xmath81 is a function of the specific solution @xmath8 , and therefore of our parameter @xmath3 .",
    "plotting the function @xmath90 shows its @xmath31 derivative is everywhere positive , within these boundaries , for the solutions available with @xmath104 .",
    "then similarly shows that the @xmath30 derivative of @xmath88 will be positive everywhere .",
    "this implies that for the g - l strings tested , no pathologies of the @xmath80 h - o coordinate system arise in the interior .",
    "thus the harmark - obers ansatz appears to be entirely consistent for the g - l branch of solutions . indeed taking @xmath81 as the required function of @xmath3 , the periodic boundaries are then at constant @xmath105 , and the horizon at @xmath93 , which is the same as considered in @xcite . from inspection of the einstein equations resulting from the interpolating h - o ansatz , harmark and obers proposed that the black hole solutions went through a topology changing solution into the h - o strings , which they thought to be _ distinct _ from the g - l strings .",
    "they parameterised their solutions exactly using @xmath81 .",
    "inverting the arguments above , we now could think of our g - l strings as being parameterised by @xmath81 rather than @xmath3 .    to summarise",
    "; we have shown that @xmath4 appears to be a topology changing limit for the g - l strings , have shown they can be consistently expressed in the h - o ansatz , with the same boundary conditions and boundary locations as discussed by harmark and obers , and furthermore have shown how their parameterisation of solutions in terms of @xmath81 fits with the one in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , harmark and obers also predict a nakedly singular topology changing point , as kol does , and as we give numerical evidence for here .",
    "it is then intriguing to consider whether , rather than being a new distinct branch of solutions , these h - o non - uniform solutions are simply the g - l strings .",
    "this would certainly appear to be the simpler outcome .",
    "then harmark and obers argument for the continuation of the black hole solutions into some non - uniform string solution appears to be consistent with kol s expectations .",
    "if this is the case , the harmark - obers ansatz might provide important clues in how to construct the g - l string solutions through the topology changing point , where an interpolating coordinate system must be devised which still allows elliptic numerical methods to be used .",
    "using our recently developed elliptic numerical methods , we present evidence supporting kol s conjecture , namely that the compactified g - l nonuniform string solutions connect to the black hole branch of solutions as @xmath4 .",
    "the evidence is based on examining several geometric quantities which must remain finite as the minimal horizon sphere shrinks to zero radius , if the conjecture is to be true .",
    "if true , we may now make quantitative predictions about the mass and geometry of the maximal black hole solution .",
    "we find the curvature at the waist appears to diverge in the @xmath106 limit , implying a naked singularity for the topology changing solution .",
    "we have also shown consistency of the harmark - obers ansatz for these g - l string solutions , which we see are contained in this ansatz .",
    "following from this , we suggest that there are no new distinct nonuniform h - o strings , as conjectured by harmark and obers , and the nonuniform strings they consider are simply the g - l strings , tying in their work with kol s picture .",
    "i am grateful to ruth gregory , gary gibbons and harvey reall for useful discussions .",
    "in particular , i thank barak kol and troels harmark for discussions and also comments on this manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by pembroke college , cambridge , and computations were performed on cosmos at the national cosmology supercomputing centre in cambridge ."
