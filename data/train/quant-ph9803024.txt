    "since the advent of quantum mechanics there has been interest in quantum models whose corresponding schrdinger equation can be solved exactly . to be more precise , by exactly solvable we mean that the spectral properties , that is , the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions , of the hamiltonian characterizing the quantum system under consideration can be given in an explicit and closed form .",
    "the most important examples are the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom . an first attempt in finding such systems",
    "has been initiated by schrdinger @xcite himself and is now know as the factorization method @xcite .",
    "this factorization method has been revived during the last two decades in connection with supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "in particular , the factorization condition which is a condition on the quantum mechanical potential for its exact solvability has been rediscovered and is now known as the so - called shape - invariance condition @xcite .",
    "in fact , there have been several attempts in finding additional shape - invariant potentials besides those already given by infeld and hull @xcite .",
    "other methods which are also closely related to supersymmetric ( susy ) quantum mechanics are based on the idea of finding pairs of ( essentially ) isospectral hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "one of these methods , the darboux method , is based on the existence of an operator @xmath0 and its adjoint @xmath1 which act as transformation operators between a pair of self - adjoint hamiltonians @xmath2 @xcite : @xmath3 obviously , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are essentially isospectral , that is , there spectra coincide except of a possible additional vanishing eigenvalue . knowing , for example",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath4 one can immediately obtain those of @xmath5 with the help of the transformation operator @xmath1 .",
    "this darboux method , which has originally been applied with linear first - order differential operators @xmath0 , has recently been extended to higher - order differential operators where it is called @xmath6-extended darboux transformation ( with @xmath6 standing for the highest order of the momentum operator appearing in @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "another different method for constructing exactly solvable systems has been suggested by abraham and moses @xcite and is based on the inverse method .",
    "as in the darboux method one starts with a given exactly solvable hamiltonian and constructs a new one whose spectral properties follow from those of the starting hamiltonian . applying this approach to susy quantum systems it is equivalent to the darboux method @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop yet another method for constructing so - called conditionally exactly solvable systems @xcite .",
    "this method , which is based on the susy formulation of one - dimensional quantum systems has recently been suggested by us in @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present the detailed ideas of this approach and to apply it to various physically relevant model systems on the real line , the half line and those on a finite interval . in particular",
    ", we will show that many of the newly found exactly solvable potentials contain as special cases also those found by the other two methods mentioned above .    in the next section we will briefly review the basic algebraic tools of susy quantum mechanics @xcite , which will be used in the general construction method presented in section 3 .",
    "the remaining three sections present a detailed discussion of examples on the real line , the half line and finite intervals . to be more explicit , in section 4",
    "we construct the most general class ( within our approach ) of susy partner potentials for the linear harmonic , the morse and the symmetric rosen - morse oscillator .",
    "section 5 contains the corresponding results for the radial harmonic oscillator and the radial coulomb problem . in section 6",
    "we consider the symmetric pschl - teller oscillator as an example on the finite interval @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the basic concepts of witten s model of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this model consists of a pair of standard schrdinger hamiltonians @xmath8 which act on the hilbert space @xmath9 of square integrable functions over a given configuration space . in this paper",
    "we will consider systems on the real line @xmath10 , on the positive half line @xmath11 , and on the finite interval @xmath12 $ ] . in the latter two cases we will impose dirichlet boundary conditions ,",
    "that is , the hilbert spaces are given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15)|\\psi(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0\\}$ ] , respectively .",
    "the so - called susy partner potentials in ( [ 2.1 ] ) are expressed in terms of the real - valued susy potential @xmath16 and its derivative @xmath17 , @xmath18 introducing the supercharge operators @xmath19 the susy partner hamiltonians factorize as follows @xmath20 and obviously obey the relation ( [ 1.1 ] ) . as a consequence @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "are essentially isospectral , that is , their strictly positive energy eigenvalues coincide . in addition one of the two hamiltonians",
    "may have a vanishing eigenvalue . in this case",
    ", susy is said to be unbroken and by convention @xcite ( via an appropriate choice of an overall sign in @xmath16 ) this ground state then belongs to @xmath5 .",
    "this convention implies that @xmath21 .",
    "let us be more explicit and denote the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of @xmath2 by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath24 for simplicity we consider only the discrete part of the spectrum here .",
    "however , relations similar to those given below are also valid for the continuous part . in the case of unbroken susy ( within the aforementioned convention )",
    "the zero - energy eigenstate of the susy system belongs to @xmath5 and the corresponding ground state has the properties @xmath25 with @xmath26 denoting the normalization constant .",
    "the remaining spectrum of @xmath5 coincides with the complete spectrum of @xmath4 and the corresponding eigenfunctions are related by susy transformations which are generated by the supercharge operators ( [ 2.3 ] ) : @xmath27 in the case of broken susy @xmath4 and @xmath5 are strictly isospectral and the eigenfunctions are also related by susy transformations : @xmath28    with the help of the relations ( [ 2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) or ( [ 2.8 ] ) it is obvious that knowing the spectral properties of , say @xmath4 , one immediately obtains the complete spectral properties of the susy partner hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "these facts will be our basis for the general construction method of conditionally exactly solvable potentials , by which we mean that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding schrdinger hamiltonian can be given in an explicit closed form ( under certain conditions obeyed by the potential parameters ) .",
    "in this section we present a rather general method for the construction of conditionally exactly solvable potentials using the susy transformations between the eigenstates of the susy partner hamiltonians @xmath2 .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "let us look for some susy potential @xmath16 such that under certain conditions on its parameters the corresponding partner potential @xmath29 becomes an exactly solvable one .",
    "for example , one of the shape - invariant potentials known form the factorization method @xcite . as a consequence",
    "the spectral properties of the associated hamiltonian @xmath4 are known exactly . from the given susy potential @xmath16 also follows the corresponding partner potential @xmath30 and its associate hamiltonian @xmath5 . as we will see below ,",
    "this potential is in general not shape - invariant but still exactly solvable via the susy transformations ( [ 2.7 ] ) or ( [ 2.8 ] ) .    in order to find an appropriate class of susy potentials we make the ansatz @xmath31 where @xmath32 is chosen such that for @xmath33 the corresponding partner potentials @xmath34 belong to the known class of shape - invariant exactly solvable ones . for a non - vanishing @xmath35",
    "we have @xmath36\\;. \\label{3.2}\\ ] ] if we now impose on @xmath35 the condition that it obeys the following generalized riccati equation @xmath37 where , for the moment , @xmath38 is assumed to be an arbitrary real constant , then the two partner potentials take the form @xmath39\\ ; , \\label{3.4}\\\\ v_-(x)&=&\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}\\bigl[\\phi^2(x)-\\phi'(x)-2f'(x)+b\\bigr]\\;. \\label{3.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath29 is , up to the additive constant @xmath40 , a shape - invariant potential and therefore exactly solvable . with the help of the susy transformation we can now also solve the eigenvalue problem for @xmath5 for",
    "the above given potential @xmath30 which , due to the additional @xmath41-dependent term @xmath42 will in general be a new non - shape - invariant potential . at this step",
    "we already realize that the free parameter @xmath38 has to be bounded below , as susy already requires a strictly positive hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "this is a first condition on a parameter contained in @xmath30 and already justifies to call it a conditionally exactly solvable ( ces ) potential .",
    "the crucial problem in finding new ces potentials is to find the most general solution of the generalized riccati equation ( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "for this reason we linearize this equation by making the ansatz @xmath43 which brings it into the form of a homogeneous linear second - order differential equation @xmath44 the general solution of this equation is given by a linear combination of two linearly independent fundamental solutions @xmath45 hence , besides the parameters contained in @xmath32 and the parameter @xmath38 the new ces potential @xmath30 will also depend on the real parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "note however , that only the quotient @xmath48 or @xmath49 will enter @xmath30 as a relevant parameter .",
    "in other words , depending on the actual situation one of these two parameters can be chosen ( without loss of generality ) to unity .",
    "the remaining parameters , however , will in general be not arbitrary real numbers and have to be chosen such that the corresponding supercharges @xmath50 are well - defined operators leaving the hilbert space invariant , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "a sufficient condition for that is to allow only for nonvanishing solutions ( [ 3.8 ] ) .",
    "thus the parameters have to be chosen such that @xmath53 is ( without loss of generality ) a strictly positive function .",
    "indeed , this condition also guarantees us that the potential @xmath54 does not have singularities inside the configuration space .",
    "so @xmath4 and @xmath5 have indeed a common domain @xmath9 .",
    "this condition is actually the most difficult part in our approach .    for all shape - invariant susy potentials , which we have considered , eq.([3.7 ] )",
    "can be reduced to a hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric differential equation .",
    "that is , the two fundamental solutions @xmath55 and @xmath56 in ( [ 3.8 ] ) are expressed in terms of hypergeometric or confluent hypergeometric functions . finding the proper linear combination leading to a strictly positive solution is very difficult and in general can be obtained only by inspection ( numerically and/or via the asymptotic behaviour at the boundaries of the configuration space ) .",
    "besides the above mentioned necessary conditions on the potential parameters @xmath38 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and possible additional ones contained in @xmath32 , we will further restrict these parameters in the following respect .",
    "let us assume that the susy quantum system ( [ 2.1 ] ) is unbroken ( broken ) for @xmath57 .",
    "then we consider only those values of the parameters for which the system with @xmath58 remains to have unbroken ( broken ) susy .",
    "hence , due to our ground - state convention , we have the following additional conditions : @xmath59 \\displaystyle \\exp\\left\\{-\\int dx\\ , w(x)\\right\\}=[u(x)]^{-1 } \\exp\\left\\{-\\int dx\\,\\phi(x)\\right\\}\\notin { \\cal h}\\quad \\mbox{for broken susy}\\;,\\\\[4 mm ] \\displaystyle \\exp\\left\\{-\\int dx\\ , w(x)\\right\\}=[u(x)]^{-1 } \\exp\\left\\{-\\int dx\\,\\phi(x)\\right\\}\\in { \\cal h}\\quad \\mbox{for unbroken susy}\\;.        \\end{array}\\ ] ]    in the following we will consider several examples on the real line , the positive half line and a finite interval . both , unbroken as well as broken susy systems will be discussed .",
    "in this section we will consider two examples on the real line in some detail .",
    "these are the linear and the morse oscillator , which both have a unbroken susy .",
    "note that there are no known shape - invariant potentials on @xmath10 which allow for a broken susy .",
    "finally , we also briefly summarize some results for the symmetric rosen - morse oscillator .",
    "the first susy system we are considering is characterized by a linear susy potential @xmath60 which gives rise to a unbroken susy with potential @xmath61 the energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the corresponding hamiltonian read @xmath62^{-1/2}h_n(x)\\exp\\{-x^2/2\\}\\ ; , \\label{4.2}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 denotes the hermite polynomial of order @xmath64 .",

    "note that the right - hand side of this inequality is positive as @xmath65 and that @xmath46 must not vanish , that is , it can be chosen equal to unity , @xmath71 .",

    "it clearly shows singularities for @xmath76 as expected . in figure 2",
    "we keep @xmath77 fixed and display the potential @xmath30 for various values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath47 .",
    "again singularities appear for @xmath78 .",
    "let us note here that the potential ( [ 4.3b ] ) has previously been considered by hongler and zheng @xcite in connection with an exactly solvable fokker - planck problem , which is closely related to witten s susy quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "special cases of @xmath30 have also previously been found with the methods mentioned in the introduction .",
    "for example , the special values @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 lead to @xmath82 ( erf denotes the error function ) which is the result of mielnik @xcite . for @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath71 and @xmath85",
    "the conditionally exactly solvable potential reads @xmath86 which has previously been obtained by bagrov and samsonov @xcite via the @xmath6-order darboux method .",
    "see also @xcite where , in particular , the cases @xmath87 and 2 have been discussed .      as a second example we consider the morse oscillator which is characterized by the susy potential @xmath88 where the condition on the parameter @xmath89 results from our ground - state convention ( see section 2 ) .",
    "changing from parameter @xmath38 to @xmath90 the corresponding potential ( [ 3.4 ] ) reads @xmath91 the ( discrete ) spectral properties of the associated hamiltonian @xmath4 are @xmath92      \\displaystyle      \\psi_n^+(x)=      \\left[\\frac{(2\\gamma-2n-2)\\gamma(n+1)}{\\gamma(2\\gamma - n-1)}\\right]^{1/2 }       2^{\\gamma - n-1}\\exp\\{-e^{-x}-x(\\gamma - n-1)\\ }      l_n^{(2\\gamma-2n-2)}(2e^{-x})\\ ; ,    \\end{array}\\ ] ] with @xmath93 denoting the generalized laguerre polynomial of order @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "obviously , positivity of @xmath4 implies the condition @xmath95 with the above susy potential ( [ 4.6 ] ) the differential equation ( [ 3.7 ] ) can be reduced to that of the confluent hypergeometric equation and in turn the general solution reads @xmath96 which has the following asymptotic behaviour for @xmath97 : @xmath98 from the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath53 for @xmath99 , which can trivially be extracted from ( [ 4.11 ] ) , and the form of the susy ground - state wavefunction @xmath100 one finds that susy remains unbroken iff @xmath101 .",
    "hence , we can set it equal to unity , @xmath102 .",
    "the positivity condition of @xmath53 can , with the help of the relation ( [ 4.13 ] ) , be translated into conditions on the remaining parameters .",
    "these are @xmath103 which have to be obeyed simultaneously .    in figure 3",
    "we have shown the family of potentials @xmath104 for @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 $ ] .",

    "these admissible ranges of @xmath108 are clearly visible in figure 3 .",

    "as examples of new ces potentials on the positive half line we consider in this section the radial harmonic oscillator , which allows for unbroken as well as broken susy , and the radial hydrogen atom problem .",

    "we also deduce a condition for the remaining parameter @xmath47 : @xmath168    finally , let us note that susy remains unbroken and the ground - state wave function for @xmath5 is given by @xmath169 hence , ( [ 6.4 ] ) and ( [ 6.7 ] ) constitutes the complete set of conditions on the three parameters @xmath170 and @xmath108 . the corresponding partner potential",

    "we expect and actually see singularities for @xmath178 .",
    "in this paper we have presented a method for constructing conditionally exactly solvable potentials starting from the known susy potentials of shape - invariant ( exactly solvable ) potentials .",
    "this method is more general then those given in the literature before . in particular , most of the previously constructed ces potentials correspond to the special case @xmath79 of our method .",
    "there are several ways to generalize the present approach .",
    "obviously , one can now choose the newly found susy potentials of this paper as input and try to construct further ces potentials from these .",
    "in general we expect to find a hierarchy of new families of ces potentials belonging to the initial shape - invariant one . in the present paper",
    "we have restricted ourselves to those parameter values which conserve the nature of susy , that is , susy remains unbroken or broken by adding the @xmath179 term to the susy potential .",
    "this condition can certainly be relaxed .",
    "some of the conditions on the potential parameters have been extracted from the asymptotic behaviour of the solution @xmath53 of ( [ 3.7 ] ) .",
    "hence , these conditions are only sufficient ones . in most cases",
    "we expect them to be also necessary , but there may be exceptions . in any case , if one wants to construct some exactly solvable model potential via the present method a detailed analysis of the allowed parameter values is advisable .",
    "we should also note that the present approach can be utilized to construct new drift potentials for which the associated fokker - planck equation allows for an explicit and exact solution .",
    "this would be similar to the discussion of the linear harmonic oscillator by hongler and zheng @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that one may choose complex values for the parameters @xmath46 and/or @xmath47 .",
    "this will lead to complex partner potentials @xmath30 whose associated non - hermitian schrdinger hamiltonian will have a real spectrum @xcite . finally , we note that all the known shape - invariant potentials give rise to a dynamical group structure @xcite .",
    "this group structure induces , via the susy transformations ( [ 2.7])-([2.8 ] ) , a related structure for the corresponding ces hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "for example , one can construct from the well - known ladder operators of the linear and radial harmonic oscillator via the supercharges ( [ 2.3 ] ) ladder operators for the corresponding partner hamiltonian @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that these operators close a non - linear algebra @xcite .",
