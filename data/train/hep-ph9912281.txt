    "until high energy experiments achieve the neccesary energy and sensitivity to discover new particles in direct production , any experimental progress beyond the standard model ( sm ) should go through the observation of loop effects in precision measurements .",
    "these new effects can be parametrized using effective lagrangians where coefficients of higher dimensional operators carry all the information on new physics . in this paper",
    "i ask how accurately one can measure these couplings in proton - proton collisions at presently available energies .",
    "the heavy mass of the top quark allows us to speculate that new physics could show up more easily in the couplings of the top quark then of any other sm particle . the most obvious place",
    "do such precision measurements is the fermilab tevatron , where at run  2 an estimated 20,000 top pairs will be produced . in this paper",
    "i am looking for small new operators , generated in many theories with strong electroweak physics , large extra dimensions , etc .",
    "the succes of the sm leads us to expect that these contributions are small , and this in turn allows us to keep only the interference with the leading sm process , top pair production through @xmath0 .",
    "the emerging restriction singles out eight different operators and these can be disentengled once we make use of the information residing in the spin state of the produced top quarks .",
    "this spin information is in turn translated into the angular distribution of the decay products of the two @xmath1 quarks .",
    "the effect of new physics operators in top pair production has been repeatedly studied in the literature  @xcite .",
    "most of these investigations look at top transverse momentum and invariant @xmath2 distributions in addition to effects in the total cross section . in the following",
    "i argue that this approach looses most of the information present in the events because it sums over top polarization states .",
    "the top quark decays into @xmath3 so quickly that its spin state is not washed out by strong interactions . in refs .",
    "@xcite the use of particular asymmetries helps to incorporate at least some of this information .",
    "we will see however , that the full use of angular distributions significantly increases the accuracy .",
    "the first attempt in this direction was taken in  @xcite , where the effect of the top chromomagnetic moment on these distributions was analyzed .",
    "we now extend this analysis for all operators that can contribute , up to dimension  6 .",
    "in fact , there is little reason , other than theoretical prejudice based on adherence to particular sorts of models , to expect that any of the operators in the set should be distinctly larger than others .",
    "for example , the dimension  5 chromomagnetic moment  @xmath4 is produced at @xmath5 , similarly to dimension  6 operators ( @xmath6 is the scale of the new physics . ) in this paper i purposefully avoid any reference to the expected relative size of the new couplings .    in what follows",
    "i classify the observable contributions in two cases : ( i ) when the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking sector contains only a light higgs doublet , and ( ii )  when all new fields are heavy . in the former case",
    "we can write an effective lagrangian where the fields are in a linear representation of the ew group , while in the latter case we must use a nonlinear representation .",
    "the approach is thus quite general and should only break down if there are new resonances in the below-@xmath7 region that interact significantly with the top quark ( such as top pions , for example . )",
    "we write down the new operators in both cases and conclude that this experiment can not tell apart the two scenarios .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : reprezes ] i first discuss the relationship of the two representations , and write down a basis of those new operators that contain at least one top field .",
    "then i find the corrections to the @xmath8 vertex , to top decay in the @xmath9 vertex and 4-quark vertices : two cp violating and six cp conserving operators .",
    "i proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : diffsigma ] by calculating the contribution of each of these new interactions to the @xmath10 spin density matrices and to top decay , and compute their contribution to the fully differential cross section in the 6-particle phase space .",
    "these contributions can be used for comparing experimental distributions to disentangle each contribution .",
    "it is important to note that one does not need to reconstruct the probability of events in the many - dimensional phase space from the measurement .",
    "that would be impossible with the event numbers involved ( on the order of several thousand ) .",
    "one can instead estimate the new couplings , using for example a maximum likelihood method .",
    "we perform such an analysis in  sec .  [",
    "sec : sens ] , using monte - carlo - generated data according to the sm distribution .",
    "this analysis tells us the attainable statistical accuracy of the estimation .",
    "i sum the results in the conclusion and discuss the discovery potential of tevatron run  2 at fermilab .",
    "i find that new physics at a scale order @xmath11 can be generically detected and that all - hadronic decay modes of the top quarks may play an important role , the complexity of these events notwithstanding .",
    "we are interested in effective lagrangians controlling top pair production and subsequent decays with or without a single sm higgs field , where all other physics resides in the higher dimensional operators . without including any model dependent  prejudice \"",
    ", we should proceed by writing down all possible operators at each dimension level and look for their experimental consequences .",
    "when a sm higgs boson is present in the lagrangian , the underlying @xmath12 symmetry imposes restrictions on the possible form of the new operators .",
    "we are free to choose the fields in a linear representation of the gauge group and implement spontaneous electroweak breaking by introducing a higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the introduction of a higss v.e.v however induces lower dimensional new operators of a non - gauge invariant form .",
    "it may well happen that the sm higgs is very heavy or is not present at all . in the absence of light resonances an effective lagrangian still make sense , but in that case its field content does not allow us to put all the fields in closed linear representations . because we are supposing that all additional fields are heavy , we are allowed to put the sm fields , including the three eaten - up goldstone bosons , in a nonlinear representation of the gauge group and require gauge invariance of the effective lagrangian .",
    "@xcite    it has been shown  @xcite , however , that the additional restrictions by imposing this nonlinearly realized symmetry are exactly compensated by the additional freedom in the choice of the gauge . note",
    "that the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom in a generic gauge ( such as longitudinal and timelike components of the gauge bosons ) lets us write down additional operators containing these fields . in the unitary gauge all these nonphysical fields fall away and the net result is that all restrictions on the new operators from gauge invariance disappear .",
    "the gauge non - invariant operators allowed this way will be similar to those in the linear representation that contain no higgs fields .    in this section",
    "i write down , in both cases , all the new physics operators that can effect the @xmath13 process , up to dimension  6 .",
    "there is a huge number of such operators .",
    "however , one may impose the following restrictions on those that may give appreciable contributions :    * the use of an effective lagrangian presupposes that the corrections are small , therefore we are justified to keep only the interference between new physics operators and sm processes .",
    "* we keep new physics only in vertices that involve at least one top quark field .",
    "other new physics , including that in light quark interactions , can presumably be seen easier in other processes .",
    "* we drop those new operators that pick up a weak coupling from an unmodified sm vertex ( such as corrections to the @xmath14 vertex , contributing to @xmath15 ) .",
    "* we drop all loop corrections .    with the above criteria some combinatorics shows that the only contributions come from ( a ) corrections to the @xmath8 vertex ,",
    "( b ) chirality preserving 4-quark operators of the color octet type , @xmath16 where the light quarks @xmath17 are must be of the same flavor to interfere with the sm process , and ( c ) corrections to the @xmath9 vertex in top decay ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : remains ] ) .",
    "the linear set of 2-quark ( plus boson fields ) operators have been classified extensively in the literature  @xcite .",
    "any complete prediction of the contributions makes sense with reference to a complete set of operators , because any partial list will tacitly imply a particular choice of operators that have zero contribution .",
    "for this reason i provide in appendix  [ app : lin ] a list of the operator basis i am using .",
    "this list completely agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite when all cp - odd operators are dropped . in appendix",
    "[ app : nonlin ] i also provide the corresponding operators in the nonlinear set .",
    "the contributions we find to the @xmath8 vertex are only : @xmath18 where the nonlinear set contributes @xmath19 and @xmath20 , while the linear set contributes @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for the detailed meaning of the r.h.s .",
    "see the appendix . )",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath23 are required to be real by hermiticity .",
    "the absence of the @xmath24 terms in the expansion of the @xmath8 form factors seems rather strange .",
    "these operators have been turned into 4-quark operators by the use of the equations of motion .",
    "next we look at corrections to top decay .",
    "we find the following three operators that seem to contribute to the @xmath9 vertex : @xmath25 in the following we will see however , that only three real linear combinations of these operators contribute to the differential cross section ; the operator with @xmath26 does not contribute at all .",
    "it is not unexpected to see fewer operators contribute to top decay because of the kinematical restrictions .",
    "only the cp - even combination @xmath27 and the cp - odd combination @xmath28 affect the differential cross sections , while the cp - even @xmath29 only changes the total rate by an overall factor of @xmath30 .",
    "because this last factor would show up only in the total top decay rate , it is irrelevant for our investigation and i drop it in the following .",
    "note that in a similar manner i ignored the contribution of a @xmath31 operator which would only modify  @xmath32 .    finally , we turn to the effect of 4-quark operators .",
    "these are the same in both set and are severely restricted by the above criteria : @xmath33 where the coefficients @xmath34 must all be real ( @xmath35 is the light quark ) .",
    "the selection of these operators has been pressed on us by the required presence of interference with the sm process . however",
    ", our operators can be embedded into the set of custodial invariant 4-fermion operators discussed in  @xcite . therefore ,",
    "we find no direct restriction on our operators from custodial symmetry .",
    "i separated off a factor of @xmath36 for easy comparison ( this factor does not need to reflect any strong interaction physics . )",
    "this completes the list of all contributing operators .",
    "their size remains remarkably unrestricted by previous experiments and by theoretical arguments .",
    "none of them contributes linearly at tree level to the electroweak precision parameters .",
    "consistency of the effective theory requires that their size can not significantly exceed @xmath37 , but the new physics scale @xmath6 is unknown .",
    "all we know for sure is that they must be less than unity , and this fact justifies throwing away all contributions that are quadratic in the new couplings .",
    "it is now a straightforward but tedious calculation to compute the contribution of each of these operators to the differential cross section , a calculation to which we now turn .",
    "in this section i derive the most important result of this paper : the contribution of each of the operators in  ( [ eq : gtt],[eq : twb],[eq:4f ] ) to the fully differential cross section comprising @xmath2  pair production and decay .",
    "the sm process is shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig:6part ] . by  @xmath38",
    "i designate the down - type quark in the decay . in",
    "( semi)leptonic decays it should be replaced by a charged lepton . in the following",

    "a breit - wigner formula is applicable to the amplitudes when the @xmath42 and @xmath43 , as well as the  @xmath44 are on shell : @xmath45    this equation allows us to separate the physics into top production , described by the density matrix @xmath46 and the decay represented by @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 averaged for the incoming spin and color , summed for outgoing color ( but the @xmath1 spins are kept fixed ) .",

    "this is the dominant process of top pair production on the tevatron at @xmath102 . at higher energies ( for example at the lhc )",
    "our analysis is not relevant , because other standard model processes become important .    using a maximum likelihood method i estimated the statistical inaccuracy of the measurement of this parameter set .",
    "we find that only @xmath93 and @xmath92 can be meaningfully measured without using the information encoded in the directions of the momenta of the six decay products .",
    "in addition , the contribution of all operators except @xmath92 to the total cross section vanishes . it is well known that the total cross section is not measured very precisely at the tevatron , due to inaccurate knowledge of the luminosity .",
    "this fact can affect therefore only the extraction of @xmath92 but not that of the other parameters .",
    "the statistical inaccuracies in the case of 2000 semileptonic events ( feasible at the tevatron ) , generically  @xmath138 , correspond to new physics on the tev scale .",
    "the actual assessment of the meaning of this accuracy should be performed in the context of particular models , but in any case these accuracies are an order of magnitude better than those previously found without the use of spin information .",
    "although these results seem to be quite robust against large backgrounds or inaccuracies in event reconstruction , it remains to be seen how large is the effect of asymmetric systematic distortions of the distributions by experimental factors .",
    "this important question should be addressed by detailed simulations of the experiments , which the present author is not equipped to perform .    as it was observed in  @xcite ,",
    "when the event number is less than @xmath139 , the estimation becomes useless due to very large inaccuracies exceeding the above quoted unitarity bounds .",
    "the small branching ratio of the leptonic top decay renders dilepton events useless for our purposes .",
    "the importance of the event number to improve the statistics leads us to consider the abundant all - hadronic decays modes .",
    "we have shown that the price to pay is the loss of the measurement of @xmath100 and @xmath93 , but the increased event number can help to improve the accuracy of the rest of the parameters .",
    "i would like to thank alakhaba datta for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada .",
    "in the linear representation there are no dimension  4 or  5 operators . in the following",
    "i provide a list of those operators with two quark fields , at dimension six , which in the unitary gauge generate vertices involving at least one top quark ( terms proportional with light or @xmath140 quark masses , and also all lepton fields , have been dropped ) :    @xmath141    here , @xmath142 are flavor indices , @xmath143 are the left handed quark doublets , @xmath144 are the right - handed singlet quarks , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the hypercharge and @xmath147 field strengths , @xmath148 is the gluon field strength , and @xmath149 is the antisymmetric @xmath150 tensor in @xmath147 space .",
    "the covariant derivative @xmath151 includes all electroweak and gluon fields .",
    "the coupling constants , @xmath152 , are ( not necessarily hermitian ) complex matrices . in the above expressions the equations of motion have been used .",
    "this is consistent if one keeps the 4-quark operators  @xcite . in the unitary gauge",
    ", replacing @xmath153 allows us to write down the new physics operators in a physical basis where goldstone fields are absent .",
    "there is a restriction on the size of @xmath154 from the fact that it gives mass to the quarks .",
    "the absence of fine tuning requires that this additional mass , @xmath155 , does not significantly exceed the physical quark masses .",
    "this coupling , however , will not give a contribution to our process .",
    "the coupling @xmath156 contains a piece @xmath157 whose effect is to modify the corresponding ckm matrix element @xmath158 .",
    "again , the absence of fine tuning imposes a restriction on the size of @xmath156 .",
    "there are obvious restrictions of the flavor changing operators in the list .",
    "in the nonlinear representation we have the following operators with two quark fields , again dropping those that contain no top quark :    * dimension  4 @xmath159 -\\frac{g}{\\sqrt2}\\left[\\lambda_{wr}^{\\alpha\\beta } \\times w_\\mu\\,\\overline    u^\\alpha_r\\gamma^\\mu d^\\beta_r+h.c.\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath160 is absorbed into the ckm matrix element @xmath158 . here , each @xmath161 is hermitian but @xmath162 can be any complex matrix . *",
    "dimension 5 + the magnetic moments are @xmath163 the electric moments are found from these with the replacement @xmath164 .",
    "+ the weak derivative couplings are @xmath165 again , @xmath166 are hermitian and @xmath167 need not be . because @xmath168 and @xmath169 are not independent , @xmath170 , we can require that @xmath168 and @xmath169 be both hermitian . * dimension  6 + dropping all operators that involve , in addition to two quark fields , at least two more electroweak bosons , we find for both @xmath171 : @xmath172 here , @xmath173 are hermitian but @xmath174 need not be",
    ".    note that in the nonlinear representation the covariant derivative @xmath151 involves only the gluon and electromagnetic fields but not the @xmath60 and @xmath175 .",
    "all combinations with these fields should be included as there is no restriction from ew gauge invariance .",
