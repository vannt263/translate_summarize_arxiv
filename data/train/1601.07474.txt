    "[ ss : ce ] ) and outline our approach to cyclotron emission probing lightning - active regions in sect  [ ss : how ] .",
    "electron cyclotron emission is a localised - source emission , which is known to emerge out of a star / planet s atmosphere shaped as a hollow cone centred around a magnetic pole ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "each cone is associated with a distinct source region as indicated in fig  [ f:11 ] .",
    "such radiation cones form due to a high directivity property of the local cyclotron emission ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , with its annular symmetry reflecting the magnetic field symmetry around the pole .",
    "rotation of the object causes the periodicity of the radiation peaks detected when the cone s walls cross the receiver s line - of - sight .",
    "the width of the observed radiation peaks ( e.g. fig . 1 in @xcite )",
    "is determined by the extension of the source and by the path length along which the radiation propagated and along which it experiences scattering and dispersion effects .",
    "it is therefore proportional to the cone - wall thickness , @xmath0 , as depicted in figs .",
    "[ f:11 ] and  [ f:1 ] .",
    "cyclotron maser emission occurs when the velocity distribution function of the electron beam , that travels into increasing magnetic field , is continually transformed by magnetic compression to form a horseshoe - shape distribution in velocity space@xcite .",
    "when eventually the horseshoe is confined enough for the major electron population to satisfy the cyclotron resonance condition , @xmath1 ( is a local cyclotron frequency , @xmath2 is a relativistic factor , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the speed of light , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are wave number and particle velocity parallel to the beam direction , respectively ] ) , the beam emits the cyclotron maser radiation at the location where this resonance happened .",
    "various factors influence the atmospheric altitude at which this resonance occurs , including the initial electrons distribution in velocity space , the location where the electrons coupled to the magnetic field , and the magnetic field values , gradient and topology .",
    "it is known from earth and saturn direct in - source observations ( e.g. , @xcite to happen inside plasma cavities with rarefied plasma .",
    "this does not imply the average local density should be low , while higher density can influence the radiation escape .",
    "being emitted from a localised region with small spread along the altitude , the radiation at the source has a sharp frequency spectrum .",
    "in addition to the in - situ observations , this was confirmed by scaled laboratory experiment  @xcite .",
    "the emission frequency therefore corresponds to the local magnetic field and depends on the altitude at which the emission happened .",
    "the cyclotron radiation is emitted nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it can be refracted by the atmospheric gas and clouds before it emerges from the atmosphere in the shape of a hollow cone ( fig.[f:11 ] ) .",
    "this can also be caused by the non - uniform magnetic field along the path and , consequently , non - uniform plasma frequency and non - uniform refractive index  .",
    "if the source is far enough from the ionosphere and the radiation is not influenced by propagation effects ( case 1 in fig.[f:11 ] ) , the radiation will propagate in a very wide straight cone ( almost plane - like , hence @xmath7 very close to @xmath8 ) with very thin cone walls ( opening angles @xmath9 , hence cone wall thickness @xmath10 in fig .",
    "[ f:11 ] ) .",
    "radio pulsars are examples of the sources of such straight ( not refracted ) propagation .",
    "typical width of the radio emission cones for pulsars , @xmath0 , is around @xmath11@xmath12 ( e.g. , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 found in @xcite ) .",
    "a summary of the underlying physics and geometry consideration addressing the question why the cyclotron emission appears in hollow cones is given in @xcite .",
    "radio observations from brown dwarfs , however , often suggest smaller cone opening angles , @xmath2 , and thicker cone walls ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath0 , due to broadened ( by propagation ) radiation pulses in the observed phase curves .",
    "the pulse broadening would be caused by interaction of the emitted radiation with the atmospheric gas and clouds , hence , larger broadening advocating a larger path lengths ( case 3 or 4 in fig .",
    "[ f:11 ] ) in contrast to very narrow pulses of non - refracted radiation ( case 1 in fig .",
    "[ f:11 ] ) .",
    "higher frequency cyclotron radiation from the same astrophysical source is emitted deeper into the magnetic field / atmosphere ( closer to the magnetic pole where the magnetic field lines converge ; see cases 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ f:11 ] ) , and hence it would refract steeper than lower frequency one .    in this case , it is likely to pass through more of the stratified atmospheric volume becoming more affected by the propagational effects , which results in thicker walls of the radiation cones .",
    "note that the effect of different refraction of different frequencies cones could only be noticeable in observations for a substantial separation of the frequencies to allow for a substantial separation of the local medium properties .",
    "e.g. , with the cyclotron frequency proportional to the local magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) , which decreases from the star / planet s surface as @xmath18 ( @xmath19 being a radial distance from the object s magnetic dipole centre ) , the square of the refractive index determined as @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the local plasma frequency and @xmath22 is the frequency of the radiation ) will also have roughly @xmath18 dependence .",
    "therefore , the difference between @xmath23 at different locations along the magnetic field lines would be proportional to @xmath24 , which means that the relative difference in refraction index , @xmath25 , is @xmath26 times smaller than the correspondent relative frequencies difference , @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of two well - separated ( in frequencies ) cones refracting differently on their way out of the star s magnetosphere is significant in observations from cu virginis .",
    "the effect of refraction was suggested as an explanation for multi - frequency observations to explain why cu virginis radio observations ( e.g. , ( kellett et al . ( 2007 ) ; trigilio et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) ) found a higher frequency cone ( i.e. , radiated deeper into the magnetic field and the atmosphere , at lower altitude ) inside a lower frequency one , radiated at higher latitude ( lo et al .",
    "the clearly seen refraction there resulted in the cones walls , @xmath0 , broadening up to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( kellett et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ) .",
    "the idea of cyclotron emission radiated in the shape of hollow cones was applied by @xcite to derive an opening angle of @xmath30 and a cone wall thickness @xmath31 for neptune s radio emission , and @xcite applies the concept to jovian radio emission .",
    "observations by @xcite for the brown dwarf tvlm 513 suggest an estimation of the opening angle from their fig.3 being @xmath32 , and the observed fwhh of the radiation peak in the same plot can provide an estimation of the radiation cone wall thickness as @xmath33 .",
    "observations by @xcite present the phase curve of the emission ( their fig .",
    "4 ) from which the cone wall thickness can be estimated as @xmath34 ( beam angle in @xcite ) . this small @xmath0 may indicate the cyclotron source located rather high in the atmosphere , comparable to case 2 in fig  [ f:11 ] .",
    "@xcite s observation for nltt 33370ab ( their figs . 3 , 4 ; rotation period p=3.7h )",
    "could be interpreted as a more complicated scenario with a rather small radiation cone with an opening angle estimated from the phase curve as @xmath35 and a wall thickness of @xmath36 .",
    "such wide beams ( large @xmath0 ) ( comparable to the refracted cu - virginis beams while being broader than non - refracted pulsar ones ) with a relatively small opening angle ( @xmath2 ) may be represented by case 4 in fig  [ f:11 ] .",
    "we note that the number of cones depends on the magnetic field geometry as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "brown dwarf atmospheres and similarly cold atmospheres , like those of extrasolar giant gas planets , are made of chemically diverse oxygen - rich , h@xmath37-dominated gases .",
    "clouds form and have a distinct influence on the atmosphere through their opacity and through element depletion .",
    "brown dwarf atmospheres can also be expected to be dynamic as brown dwarfs are fast rotators .",
    "giant gas planets may be close to their host star such that irradiation drives strong winds inside their atmospheres .",
    "it is plausible to expect that such dynamic , cloud forming atmospheres generate lighting activity ( @xcite ) more intensive than in the solar system and affecting larger atmospheric volumes ( @xcite ) .",
    "ultra - cool atmospheres may show different kind of discharges in form of thunderstorms including inter - cloud and intra - cloud discharges .",
    "transient luminous events ( sprites , elves , jets , etc . )",
    "are frequently observed on earth in conjunction with lighting .",
    "sprites and jets are substantially more extended than lighting , and therefore increase the atmospheric volume affected by flash ionisation events .",
    "these flash ionisation events perturb the upper atmosphere and magnetosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) . for a brown dwarf with a radius of @xmath38 km and a cyclotron peak s half - width of",
    "about @xmath39 @xcite , the spread of the beam ( @xmath0 in fig  [ f:11 ] ) emerging from the atmosphere is @xmath40km@xmath41 km . if this radiation beam underwent a ten - fold spatial dispersion ( for example case 3 in fig .",
    "[ f:11 ] ) , the source region near the magnetic pole would have an extension ( i.e. , the cone s wall thickness ) about 244 km across .",
    "this horizontal ( with respect to the star / planet s surface ) extend of a storm between @xmath42 km and @xmath43 km determines the volume of the column of the atmosphere which could be probed by the cyclotron beam .",
    "recent observation from saturn s storm area indicate that the storm that emerges at the surface alone has a head diameter of @xmath44 km .",
    "@xcite demonstrate how the atmospheric dynamic for brown dwarfs produces similar pattern .",
    "these rough ideas of the radiation / storm longitudinal extensions suggest them to be reasonably comparable for the storms being able to affect a significant portion of the beam s radiation .",
    "we suggest that if the ecm radiation travels through the extended atmosphere of the brown dwarf / planet , it may be modulated by conductivity changes in the atmosphere produced by flash ionisation and can proposed to probe the extended atmosphere it travels through .    in the following ,",
    "we consider a local fragment of the radiation cone at a direction that will rotate into the observer s view .",
    "cyclotron emission is a frequency - resonant phenomenon and can therefore be represented by a harmonic wave .",
    "we study how this coherent wave changes after experiencing a flash ionisation event affecting a volume it paths through .",
    "we consider a pre - existing coherent radiation ( cyclotron radiation or similar ) travelling through an atmosphere environment with flash - ionisation events ( e.g. lighting , sprites , flares ) .",
    "its coherent character allows to model this incident electromagnetic field as a harmonic wave .",
    "we are interested in how the electromagnetic field of a pre - existing emission is transformed by the flash ionisation .",
    "the interaction between an electromagnetic wave and a medium rapidly changing in time is highly non - linear .",
    "current approaches that model radiation , emitted by flash ionization processes , are focused on microscopic modelling of charged particle production ( electrons and ions ; e.g. ,  @xcite ) , in some cases including electric ( @xcite ) or magnetic ( @xcite ) fields . as a result ,",
    "microscopic approaches predict linear growth rates of the number density of charged particles , and hence , the linear growth stage of electromagnetic emission only . in order to determine the maximum of the flash ionisation event , its decline and duration , the non - linear saturation and the consequent drop in the particles velocities and production rate needs to be taken into account .",
    "this will allow us to qualify and quantify the electromagnetic field response . in the case of an external field",
    "probing the flash - ionisation area , non - linear interactions between field and the transient , ionised medium can be expected to be stronger compared to the discharge s own radiation field because of the higher amplitude of the initial ( cyclotron ) field .",
    "we therefore apply the concept of a parameterised time - dependent conductivity in a macroscopic model to allow us to account for non - linear interactions between the ionised medium and the field .",
    "we use maxwell s equations formalism to study the field transformation by the transient processes .",
    "we model the flash ionisation by a time - dependent conductivity with a flash - like shape .",
    "a flash - shape like conductivity function first rises describing the fast linear growth of the ionised particles at a breakdown ionisation stage , then reaching saturation and eventually declines decribing the ending of the ionisation process ( see fig.[f:4 ] ) .",
    "this time - dependent functional form is inspired by experimental and observational results ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "flash ionisation events like lightning , coronal discharges , energetic explosions or eruptions , can be suitably described by a time - dependent conductivity without expensive small - scale modelling , because suitable variation in amplitude , duration , shape and the flash front s gradient can be adopted .",

    "in the model presented in this paper , the electromagnetic fields in a transient medium are described by the linear maxwell s equations . however , the material coefficients , dielectric permittivity , magnetic permeability or conductivity , as part of maxwell s equations in turn depend on the fields , and therefore the field equations are intrinsically non - linear .",
    "this section presents the derivation of the equations for the electric component of the electromagnetic field for a time - dependent conductivity .",
    "the interaction of the pre - existing coherent radiation field with the transient event starts at the time @xmath47 . at this moment , the medium s conductivity begins changing in time in a flash - like manner due to the ionisation process .",
    "we consider the problem in one spacial dimension , @xmath48 , and assume that the electromagnetic fields only have components which are perpendicular to that dimension , @xmath49    the fields should satisfy maxwell s equations ( in cgs units ) , @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a dielectric permittivity of the medium , which is dimensionless and is considered to be constant in time , @xmath4 is the velocity of light [ cm / s ] , @xmath52 is the time - dependent conductivity [ 1/s ] , and @xmath53 [ statv / cm ] and @xmath54 [ oe ] are the electric and magnetic components of the electromagnetic field , correspondingly .",

    "it is known that lightning discharges radiate an electromagnetic field ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this radiation occurs when runaway electrons , produced by ionising discharges , form conducting currents which act as radiating antennae .",

    "the reason for this is that , above a certain threshold , the conductive medium would be efficiently damping the field , allowing the damping to prevail over the effect of pumping the field by the transient event s energy . an ionised medium ( like the ionosphere )",
    "is generally non - transparent to most of the radio frequencies .",
    "this is one of the biggest problems with observing lightning discharges from outside of the solar system or terrestrial planets . with additional energy coming into the radiation field from powerful ionisation processes ,",

    "however , processes of higher extremity ( involving larger peak value of conductivity flash ) would result in a metal - like ionised area which would damp the electromagnetic field dramatically .",
    "the classification is based on the effect which is produced by the transient event on the electromagnetic field , e.g. , ` strong ' event ( ` big ' conductivity flash ) attributes to damping the field , as in fig .",

    "only a small portion of this visible light can be affected by a local event , making the effect of flash ionisation on visible light smaller compared to its effect on radio waves .",

    "some of brown dwarfs known for radio cyclotron emission are also fast rotators , e.g. , tvlm513 has a period of just 1.9673  h @xcite .",
    "this makes them easier objects for multi - period observations .",
    "the motivation behind this research is to find a way to probe atmospheric discharge processes which are otherwise inaccessible . for this purposes",
    ", we investigated if and how a coherent emission ( e.g. a cyclotron maser radio emission ) could be modulated by passing through a region with flash ionisation processes in , for example , an atmospheric environment or a magnetosphere .",
    "our results are applicable to a wider variety of problems in astrophysics when a pre - existing radiation travels through a rapidly ionising medium .",
    "these can include discharges in protoplanetary disks  @xcite and possibly fast radio bursts ( see e.g.  @xcite which could be attributed to flash transient events if their variations are not periodically detected . our model ( eqs .",
    " ) can also be applied to microwave background changed during the reionisation epoch  @xcite if the limitations of 1d space - uniform consideration are reasonable for a particular scenario .",
    "we develop a model to describe the influence of flash ionisation events on pre - existing radiation that passes through the region where the transient events happen .",

    ".   the transformation of coherent emission by fast transient processes in the medium of its propagation can be observable ; 2 .   attributing larger signal perturbations to more powerful processes",
    "is not always correct , as more powerful processes can lead to smaller response signals ; 3 .",
    "flash processes of intermediate intensity can be detected by short - term amplification of the signal .",
    "the response field s duration can be related to the flash ionisation s time scale and intensity ( fig .",
    "[ f:7 ] ) ; 4 .",
    "if the initial emission signal is powerful enough to detect the character of the damping , the small pulse s amplitude and duration in the response field can provide information about the ionisation flash magnitude ( peak value of conductivity ) and duration ; 5 .",
    "if the detection of the field s variation is possible for several related flashes ( attributed to the same undergoing event , like multiple strokes of the same cloud - to - ground lightning discharge ) and allows deriving the conductivity peak values from additional information , it would be possible to determine whether the discharges started as a runaway electrons breakdown or rather like capacity discharges , by deriving the dependence of the field responses maximum values on maximum value of the conductivity change .",
    "absence of a noticeable plateau in this dependence ( see fig .",
    "[ f:6 ] ) suggests that the runaway breakdown discharge is likely to be a source of the ionisation , which requires about ten times lower voltage to enable the discharge in comparison to a conventional capacity - like discharge .",
    "if the plateau is noticeable , then a capacitor - like discharge is more probable .",
