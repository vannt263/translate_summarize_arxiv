    "since complex network models @xcite were applied to mathematical epidemiology @xcite  in such a way that the host population is modelled as a contact network where nodes represent individuals and links stand for contacts among them  the topological structure of the underlying network has shown a strong impact on the spread of infectious diseases @xcite .",
    "for instance , based on mean - field approximations , @xcite suggested that there is no typical epidemic threshold in a scale - free ( sf ) network which follows a power - law degree distribution @xmath0 with the power exponent @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "otherwise , there is a positive critical value @xmath2 of the transmission rate @xmath3 only for @xmath4 .",
    "it is worth remarking that in a more mathematically rigorous analysis , @xcite proved that the critical value @xmath2 is also zero for contact processes on random networks with power - law degree distributions for any power exponent @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", the infection can pervade the whole sf network provided the transmission rate is nonzero .    over the past decades",
    ", considerable progress has been made in the study of epidemic models on static networks , where the network topology remains fixed during the process of disease transmission .",
    "many topological features of the network , such as the heterogeneity @xcite , degree correlation @xcite and clustering @xcite , were explicitly addressed , yet most studies ignore the impact of human behavior ( in response to infection ) on the disease @xcite .",
    "such effect is likely to be especially acute when modifications to human behavior causes changes in the structure of the underlying contact network @xcite .",
    "most recently , it has been demonstrated that a better understanding of the interplay between human behavior and epidemic dynamics would help design effective intervention strategies such as vaccination and social distancing policies , and improve the cost effectiveness of disease control @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great significance to incorporate human behavior in the study of network epidemiology @xcite . in general",
    ", there are two scenarios of human behavior to be considered in the face of a contagious disease .",
    "first , at the macroscopic level authorities enact public containment programs such as quarantine or vaccination ; second , at the microscopic level individuals adopt self - protective measures against the disease based on their perceived risk of infection @xcite .",
    "vaccination is one of the most effective public policies for preventing the transmission of infectious diseases @xcite , and to date there has been a wealth of studies on various vaccination strategies for epidemic models in complex networks @xcite , indicating powerful effects of vaccination on the inhibition of disease transmission , even though some vaccines provide temporary immunity and only reach part of the population .",
    "for instance , targeted vaccination towards high - degree nodes is widely known to have a much higher effectiveness than random vaccination  either in sf networks @xcite or in small - world networks @xcite .",
    "however , targeting the highest - degree nodes requires full knowledge of the degree of each node in the network . to overcome this shortcoming ,",
    "an alternative vaccination strategy based on local information has been proposed @xcite . under this strategy vaccination",
    "is implemented on a random acquaintance of a randomly chosen node .",
    "again , this acquaintance vaccination proves to be more effective than random vaccination since it prefers to target high - degree nodes ( this is a consequence of the so - called friendship paradox  on average neighbours of a random node have more neighbours than the node itself )",
    ".    on the other hand , appropriate and timely response of individuals to a spreading contagion may improve the efficiency of vaccination and save medical resources .",
    "several studies looking at this hypothesis have been framed in network epidemic models through the addition of a rewiring mechanism ( for details , see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "a susceptible - infected - susceptible ( sis ) epidemic model on adaptive networks was first proposed by @xcite , where at a given rate susceptible individuals rewire their connections from infected neighbours to the susceptibles .",
    "the basic idea of this adaptive network epidemiology is that individuals tend to change their habits and social contacts to avoid infection in response to a disease threat @xcite .",
    "still further rewiring scenarios have also been considered reflecting different individual reactions to the infectious status of others .",
    "for example , @xcite introduced a _",
    "neighbour exchange _ model to account for the impacts of the stability of social contacts on the spread of infectious diseases @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a random swapping of contact partners between susceptible - infected and infected - infected links was studied in @xcite .",
    "most adaptive epidemic models have largely focused on the standard sis model @xcite , where the rewiring operation isolates infective individuals from the susceptible population in the long run , and therefore influences the epidemic propagation . in turn , the larger the infected fraction in the population , the more likely susceptible individuals will choose to rewire their contacts with infective neighbours .",
    "in other words , the epidemic prevalence can affect individual behavior , while avoiding contacts with infection also exerts a strong impact on epidemic dynamics . typically , in an adaptive network model both the dynamics of and on the network form a feedback loop @xcite , which usually involves many interesting dynamical features such as bistability and oscillation @xcite .",
    "so far , little attention has been paid to the combined effects of public vaccination and individual protection .",
    "only recently have shaw and schwartz adopted a random vaccination strategy in an adaptive sis model to examine the interplay between individual rewiring of social contacts and random vaccination of susceptible individuals @xcite . in their model ,",
    "vaccinated individuals secure complete protection from infection unless they return to the susceptible state .",
    "that is , the vaccinated can not be infected directly from their infective neighbours .",
    "however , there is clear evidence that some vaccines are not completely efficient , namely , they come with no guarantee of perfect protection from infection @xcite  rather , they confer only partial immunity and a lower transmission rate than the unvaccinated susceptibles .",
    "moreover , in reality , vaccines rarely cover the entire population and only provide finite - time immunity against infection . in light of this , @xcite proposed a compartmental sis model with imperfect vaccination , where vaccinated individuals may contract infection directly from their infectious contacts , although at a vaccine - reduced transmission rate @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this as the siv model .",
    "most recently , this imperfect vaccination model has been restudied on static sf networks , revealing surprising epidemic behavior @xcite .",
    "however , the role of individual behavior has been neglected in changing the transmission routes of the disease as well as in reshaping the contact patterns of the underlying network .",
    "this paper aims to provide a systematic framework that couples public vaccination and individual protection . for this purpose",
    ", we develop an adaptive siv model by extending the compartmental siv model @xcite to an adaptive network @xcite .",
    "the adaptive siv model integrates contact rewiring at the microscopic level with vaccination intervention at the macroscopic level in response to disease propagation .",
    "in particular , we consider a population without and with demographic effects , respectively , to account for two different cases as follows : case ( 1)the disease spreads through the population much faster than the births and deaths of individuals , and case ( 2)the disease spreads on a timescale comparable to the speed of individuals births and deaths .",
    "this observation mainly depends on what type of the disease is being modelled .",
    "for instance , the seasonal influenza can be modelled well in a population without demography .",
    "conversely , for the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) where infection span decades , then the demographic impact should be taken into account @xcite .",
    "we establish a mathematical configuration for both cases , which allows for an in - depth analysis of the mutual interaction between disease propagation and network evolution .    in sect .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the adaptive siv model , and construct a set of approximating deterministic equations for both a closed system and one with demography .",

    "susceptible nodes are infected by their infected neighbours at a transmission rate @xmath5 per @xmath6-link and are vaccinated at a per capita rate @xmath7 . infected nodes",
    "recover and return to being susceptible at a per capita rate @xmath8 .",
    "vaccinated nodes become susceptible at a per capita rate @xmath9 and are infected at a vaccine - reduced transmission rate @xmath10 per @xmath11-link due to imperfect immunity . with the background demographic changes taken into consideration , we assume that each node can give birth to a susceptible node with a birth rate @xmath12 , and each node dies at a natural death rate @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the infected nodes die with an extra rate @xmath14 because of infection , namely , each infected node will die at a rate @xmath15 . in the adaptive siv model , we assume that only susceptible nodes are permitted to rewire connections away from their infected neighbours at a rate @xmath16 per @xmath6-link . in other words , with rate @xmath16 , for each @xmath6-link , the susceptible node breaks the link to the infected node and forms a new link to a randomly selected susceptible or vaccinated node . ]",
    "we employ individual rewiring of contacts with infective neighbours as an individualised self - protective behavior and the vaccination scheme ( reducing the rate of infection ) as a public intervention in reaction to an infectious disease .",
    "the nodes of the network represent individuals in the population and links are potentially infectious contacts among them . in the adaptive siv model",
    ", each node may have only one of the three possible states : susceptible ( @xmath17 ) , infected ( @xmath18 ) and vaccinated ( @xmath19 ) . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , the transition probabilities for node states are as follows : a susceptible node becomes infected with the transmission rate @xmath5 per @xmath6-link ( where the parameters in the model definition are listed in table  [ table1 ] ) ;    1lx term & meaning + @xmath5 & transmission rate per @xmath6-link + @xmath8 & recovery rate from infection + @xmath7 & vaccination rate of susceptibles + @xmath9 & relapse rate of vaccinated individuals ( i.e. , each vaccinated returns to being susceptible after an average time period of @xmath20 due to temporary immunity ) + @xmath21 & effectivity of the vaccine - induced protection against infection ( i.e. , vaccinated individuals can be infected at a vaccine - reduced transmission rate @xmath10 ) + @xmath12 & birth rate + @xmath13 & natural death rate + @xmath14 & death rate from infection + @xmath16 & rewiring rate per @xmath6-link where the susceptible node breaks away from the infected and then establishes a connection with a randomly chosen noninfected node +    an infective node recovers back to the susceptible state with the recovery rate @xmath8 ; according to random vaccination strategy , a susceptible node is vaccinated at the vaccination rate @xmath7 ; a vaccinated node returns to the susceptible state with the resusceptibility rate @xmath9 as the vaccine wears off ; due to imperfect immunity , the vaccinated node will be infected directly from one of its infective neighbours with a reduced transmission rate @xmath10 , where the parameter @xmath22 measures the inefficacy of the vaccine - induced protection against infection ( @xmath23 means the vaccine is completely effective , while @xmath24 means the vaccine is totally ineffective ) . with the background demography taken into consideration , we assume that each node can give birth to a susceptible node with a birth rate @xmath12 , and each node ( irrespective of its state ) dies at a natural death rate @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the infected nodes die with an extra rate @xmath14 because of infection .",
    "that is to say , each infected node will die at a rate @xmath15 .",
    "meanwhile , the network is rewired adaptively during the disease propagation [ see fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) as an illustration ] . for simplicity ,",
    "only susceptible nodes are allowed to rewire their connections from infected neighbours to randomly selected noninfected ( either susceptible or vaccinated ) nodes with the rewiring rate @xmath16 .",
    "self links and multiple links are prohibited .",
    "the adaptive siv model therefore consists of two processes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) : one is the node dynamics due to the epidemic spreading and the birth and death process , the other is the link dynamics due to the rewiring of @xmath6-links of the underlying network .    in what follows , we consider two types of population system  a closed system without demography and an open system with demography , respectively , to account for the following two different cases : case ( 1 )  the disease spreads sufficiently fast that the background demographic changes are not significant , and case ( 2 )  the epidemic occurs on a timescale comparable to the speed of the birth and death process .",

    "the results are obtained by averaging over @xmath140 time steps at the steady state with @xmath141 independent simulations for the model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the average degree of infected nodes is smaller than that of susceptible nodes and far smaller than that of vaccinated ones  because of rewiring . in the closed population without demographic turnover , the breaking of _",

    "therefore , the average degree of susceptible nodes is larger than the average degree of infected nodes in the steady state . in this regard ,",
    "the random vaccination of the susceptibles favors higher - degree nodes in the network due to rewiring @xcite , and thus is expected to be effective , as in previous studies on targeted vaccination @xcite . since the vaccine - reduced transmission rate is relatively low , vaccinated nodes accumulate connections from rewiring , therefore they have a broad degree distribution with a very large average degree [ see @xmath133 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) and @xmath137 in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) ] .",
    "there are more",
    "_ si_-links ( at a lower level of epidemic prevalence but with a higher density of susceptible nodes ) in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) than in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , thus adaptive rewiring has stronger effect on the average degree of infected nodes , which in turn reduces the average degree of susceptible nodes due to the recovery process .",
    "it is worth remarking that the presence of the low infection and high infection states is interesting , because the original adaptive network model by @xcite just found bistability between endemic and disease - free states .",
    "in essence , the differences between the low infection and high infection states are rooted in the different selections of target nodes towards which the original susceptible nodes will be rewired . according to the rewiring mechanism in our model ,",
    "after susceptible nodes break away their connections from infected neighbours , the susceptibles establish new connections towards randomly selected noninfected nodes , namely , either susceptible or vaccinated .",
    "note that susceptible nodes can be infected at a much higher rate than vaccinated nodes .",
    "if vaccinated nodes are selected as the rewiring target , then more vaccinated nodes are able to accumulate connection from rewiring .",
    "thus the mean degree of vaccinated nodes are much higher and they become hub nodes in the network . among the neighbours of vaccinated nodes , susceptible nodes are in the majority since they are rewired towards the vaccinated nodes . on the other hand ,",
    "vaccinated nodes are not permitted to rewire away from infected neighbours .",
    "once the vaccinated nodes are infected by one of their neighbours , these hub nodes will induce more infections , leading to a high prevalence in the steady state . on the contrary ,",

    "there is a positive ( negative ) degree correlation if @xmath145 increases ( decreases ) with @xmath27 , corresponding to the assortative ( disassortative ) mixing pattern , where high - degree nodes preferentially connect to highly ( sparsely ) connected ones @xcite . otherwise , the network is degree uncorrelated as @xmath146 is independent of @xmath27 .",
    "similar to the work by @xcite , the original network is set to be uncorrelated where the initial configuration displays no degree correlations . after we incorporate rewiring into the networked siv model @xcite",
    ", substantial degree correlations appear .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the average degree of the nearest neighbours @xmath145 of degree-@xmath27 nodes as a function of @xmath27 for each class of nodes . in the case of a high prevalence @xmath139 [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) ] , the network shows a positive degree correlation for small degrees . on the contrary , for larger @xmath27",
    "the network is disassortative mixing .",
    "similarly , in the case of a low prevalence @xmath134 [ fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ] , the network is generally disassortative mixing as @xmath145 decreases with degree @xmath27 and eventually closes to @xmath147 .",
    "the appearance of the disassortative mixing pattern possibly arises from the fact that @xmath11-links are not allowed for rewiring and that the vaccinated nodes continue to accumulate connections when susceptible nodes rewire towards them , until the vaccinated nodes are infected or turn to being susceptible again . on the other hand",
    ", the rewiring mechanism separates the infected and susceptible nodes , and typically divides the network into an infected cluster and a susceptible cluster . note that the mean degrees of infected nodes and susceptible nodes are both much smaller than the mean degree of vaccinated nodes .",
    "therefore , the original susceptible ( or infected ) nodes that have relatively small degrees are connected to the new susceptible ( or infected ) nodes that are transformed from vaccinated nodes with high degrees , giving rise to a negative degree correlation .",
    "the adaptive siv model with demographic effects is expressed as a set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10])([eq:18 ] ) , which can be integrated with a standard numerical integration scheme . in this paper , the fourth - order runge - kutta iteration algorithm is employed to obtain the numerical solution of the model .",

    "we confirm the results derived from the above equations by explicitly simulating the dynamics over two different initial networks  er @xcite and sf networks .",

[ fig7](e ) and [ fig7](f ) , respectively . in the presence of node birth , different degree distributions of the newborns will lead to different network structures .",
    "it is clear that the final network is narrowly distributed if nodes are born with a poisson degree distribution [ fig .",
    "[ fig11](c ) ] , while the network evolves to a broader degree distribution if the newborns follow a power - law degree distribution [ fig .",
    "[ fig11](d ) ] .",
    "it is worth noting that by the mathematical model of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:10])([eq:18 ] ) , the theoretical results of degree distribution can be obtained not only for the model with demography , but also for the case without demography where the birth and death rates are set to zero , as illustrated in the figs .",

    "widespread public vaccination programmes and individual protective behavior are two key factors of disease control . ignoring either component will reduce the accuracy of our models or , ultimately , the effectiveness of containment measures . in this paper",
    ", we developed a mathematical framework to model the combined effects of public vaccination intervention and individual protective behavior on epidemic dynamics by studying an sis model with imperfect vaccination in a dynamic contact network .",
    "the model was analyzed in a closed population without demographic turnover and a varying population with births , deaths and migration .    in the case of a closed population ( without demographic effects ) , we focused specifically on the combined effects of macroscopic random vaccination and microscopic contact rewiring on the system dynamics by conducting a bifurcation analysis of the model .",
    "our analysis shows that compared with either individual strategy , the combination of vaccination programme and adaptive rewiring contributes to a more effective control for the spread of infectious diseases by increasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold of the epidemic .",
    "the larger the vaccination and rewiring rates are , the safer the population is from infectious diseases .",
    "the occurrence of stable epidemic cycle at a low prevalence is particularly relevant for the seasonality of influenza epidemics @xcite .",
    "moreover , the conjunction of vaccination and rewiring has significant impacts on the topology of the underlying contact network .",
    "both the degree distributions and degree correlations among different classes of nodes are characteristically distinct .    in the case of a varying population with demographic development ( births , deaths and migration ) , we studied the epidemic patterns and the network topology on the basis of the dynamical behavior of nodes and links at a microscopic level , using both the probability generating function and the pairwise approximation .",
    "this modelling approach allows us to incorporate the effects of vaccination and rewiring as well as the demographic changes into network - based epidemiological models with arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "the analytical results of the temporal evolution of both the number of infective individuals and the number of infectious contacts , as well as the degree distribution of nodes in each class , have shown a good agreement with extensive computational simulations . in general , diseases in sf networks spread relatively faster yet end at a lower level of epidemic prevalence , as compared with the er networks .",
    "ironically , the combination of contact rewiring and random vaccination aiming to contain the epidemic would probably facilitate the disease spread . while the network without demography evolves to an identical topology for different initial network configurations , the network with demography develops into different structures depending on the degree distribution of the newborns .",
    "besides , the underlying network structure displays no degree correlation regardless of model parameters and initial settings .    in summary",
    ", the present work manifests the significant combined effects of public vaccination intervention and individual protective behavior on both the epidemic dynamics and the underlying network structure .",
    "moreover , the strikingly different results for the two cases of population assumptions indicate the strong impacts of the demographic turnover .",
