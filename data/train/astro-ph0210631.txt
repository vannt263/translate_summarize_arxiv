    "the behavior of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows is well known for a spherical shell propagating into a constant density inter - stellar medium ( ism ) or into a circum - burst wind with a regularly decreasing density .",
    "sari , piran & narayan ( 1998 , hereafter spn98 ) have presented a simple analytic model for the ism case , assuming synchrotron emission from an adiabatic relativistic blast wave .",
    "chevalier & li ( 1999 ) generalized this model for a circum - burst wind density profile . in both cases",
    "the flux shows a spectral and temporal segmented power law behavior , @xmath3 .",
    "the indices @xmath4 and @xmath5 change when a spectral break frequency ( the cooling frequency , @xmath6 , the synchrotron frequency , @xmath7 , or the self absorption frequency , @xmath8 ) passes through the observed band .",
    "the values of the spectral and temporal indices depends on the cooling regime ( fast or slow ) and on the ordering of @xmath9 relative to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "most grb afterglows display a smooth power law decay .    in several cases",
    "the observed afterglow light curves have shown deviations from a smooth power law .",
    "the most prominent case is the recent grb 021004 whose optical counterpart was observed at a very early time , @xmath13 sec after the trigger ( fox et al .",
    "following observations at short intervals showed fluctuations around a power law decay .",
    "we develop here the general theory for grb afterglows when the relativistic blast wave encounters a variable external density or its energy ( per unit solid angle ) varies with time .",
    "such variations in energy could arise due to refreshed shocks , when initially slower moving matter encounter the blast waves after it has slowed down ( kumar & piran , 2000a ) , or due to angular variability within the relativistic jet ( kumar & piran , 2000b ) .",
    "both variation in the density or in the energy can reproduce a variable light curve and in particular the observed r - band light curve of grb 021004 .",
    "however , as we argue latter , there are some weak indications that a variable energy model that arises from a patchy shell structure ( random angular fluctuations in the jet ) seems to give the best fit to all the available data .",
    "if correct this interpretation implies that the electron power law index is @xmath14 , a suggestion that might be confirmed with a more detailed multi - wavelength spectrum .",
    "we generalize the results of spn98 to a time dependent energy and a spatially varying external density .",
    "we first outline the general model and then investigate two specific cases .",
    "following spn98 we assume that the dominant radiation process is synchrotron emission . in our model",
    ", the mass in the blast - wave at radius @xmath15 is taken to be the integrated external mass up to this radius , and we assume that all this mass is radiating . the internal energy density of the emitting matter at radius @xmath15 is taken from the shock jump conditions , which depend only on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these approximations are valid as long as the external density and the energy in the blast - wave do not vary too rapidly . for example a large density jump can produce a reverse shock while a sharp density drop may initiate a rarefaction wave .",
    "the accuracy of this model decreases as the variations in the density and the energy become more rapid .",
    "a few hundred seconds after the grb the relativistic ejecta decelerates , driving a strong relativistic shock into the ambient medium .",
    "as radiative losses become negligible the flow settles into the adiabatic self - similar blandford - mckee ( 1976 ) blast wave solution .",
    "energy conversion takes place within the shock that propagates into the external medium .",
    "the energy equation reads : @xmath18m[r(t)]c^{2}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the isotropic equivalent energy and @xmath20 is a constant of order unity whose exact value depends on the density profile behind the shock ( e.g. for an external density @xmath21 , @xmath22 ; blandford & mckee 1976 ) . in the following we use @xmath23 . in equation ( [ e ] ) , @xmath24 is the mass of the blast - wave , i.e. the integrated external mass up to a radius @xmath15 , @xmath25    the observed time , @xmath26 , is related to @xmath15 and @xmath27 through two effects .",
    "first , the observed time of a photon emitted on the line of sight at a radius @xmath15 is @xmath28 .",
    "second , photons emitted at different angles at the same radius @xmath15 are observed during an interval of @xmath29 .",
    "following spn98 we estimate the observed time interval during which most of the emission emitted at radius @xmath15 is received as @xmath30 . therefore : @xmath31    for a constant density ism @xmath32 and @xmath33 . of course ,",
    "this treatment of the angular effects is only approximate .",
    "in most cases angular spreading will smooth out any variability on time scales shorter than @xmath34 .",
    "we further assume that the electron energy distribution is a power law with an index @xmath35 , and that the magnetic field and the electrons hold fractions @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , of the internal energy . now , taking @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 from spn98 and the equations above we obtain :    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    where @xmath44 denotes the value of the quantity q in units of @xmath45 ( c.g.s ) , @xmath46 is the observed time in days , @xmath47 is the distance to the grb , and for simplicity we do not include cosmological effects throughout the paper . the above equations readily provide expressions for the flux density at different frequencies @xmath48 we concentrate on the above two power law segments , since they are usually expected to be the most relevant for the optical light curve .",
    "similar expressions for other power law segments of the spectrum may be derived similarly .",
    "these are the generic expressions for a varying energy and a varying external density profile .",
    "in addition to the explicit dependence on @xmath49 in eq .",
    "[ eq fnu generic ] there is an implicit dependence through @xmath50 , @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] .",

    "@xmath56 is only weakly dependent on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , while the dependence on @xmath19 is roughly linear ( note that @xmath59 depends on @xmath19 also implicitly through @xmath15 that appears in @xmath24 ) .",
    "this feature enables us to distinguish between energy dominated fluctuations and density dominated fluctuations in the afterglow light curve , when there are measurements both above and below the cooling frequency , @xmath2 .    in reality , it is unlikely that both variations ( in @xmath60 and in @xmath61 ) will be important in a given burst ( since this would require a coincidence ) .",
    "therefore , we shall consider below , in some detail , the cases where one of these quantities is constant while the other one varies .",

    "two different phenomena could cause energy variations in the emitting region : refreshed shocks and initial energy inhomogeneities in the jet . refreshed shocks ( kumar & piran 2000a )",
    "are produced by massive and slow shells , ejected late in the grb , that take over the blast - wave at late times , when the blast - wave has decelerated .",
    "these shells bring new energy into the blast - wave .",
    "the collision produces a refreshed forward shock propagating into the blast - wave and a reverse shock propagating into the slower shell .",

    "the observed flux is similar to the one emitted by a constant energy blast wave with the new and larger energy .",
    "refreshed shocks can only increase the energy .",
    "therefore a refreshed shocks energy profile should grow monotonically with time , most likely in a step wise profile ( each step corresponds to the arrival of a new shell ) .",
    "initial energy inhomogeneities ( the patchy shell model of kumar & piran 2000b ) in the jet could be either regular or irregular ones . during the jet evolution regions within the relativistic flow with an angular separation larger than @xmath109 are casually disconnected .",

    "the causal connected regions grow and the initial inhomogeneities can be smoothed on angular scale of @xmath112 .",
    "recent numerical hydrodynamical studies ( kumar & granot 2002 ) show that at early times the initial fluctuations remain almost unchanged , and are smoothed only at rather late times .",

    "such a density profile does not look feasible .",
    "for @xmath155 the density increases by an order of magnitude at @xmath156 and remains roughly constant at larger radii .",
    "this is consistent with the termination shock of a stellar wind that interacts with the ambient medium ( wijers 2001 ) , provided that the latter has a very high density of @xmath157 in order for the radius of the wind termination shock to agree with the afterglow shock radius inferred from the time of the first bump .",
    "when @xmath158 the density profile rises by almost an order of magnitude and then decreases , more gradually , back to its initial value .",
    "the initial rise agrees with the one suggested by lazzati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , however , lazzati et al . suggest a consequent decrease in the density to a factor of 5 below the initial density value followed by a second and smaller density bump , where according to our results such a large dip in the density is not required .",
    "the difference between the profiles arises mainly due to the different approximation used for the angular smoothing effect ( see the appendix ) .",
    "so far , we have assumed a spherically symmetric external density profile , @xmath159 . this may occur due to a variable stellar wind , but is not expected for an ism . as we obtain that an underlying constant density profile provides a better fit for grb 0210004 , it is more natural to expect density fluctuations in the form of clumps , rather than being spherically symmetric , in this case",
    ". this interpretation requires @xmath160 for which the density at large radii decreases back to its value at @xmath148 . as the density profile for @xmath144 is not smooth ,",
    "several density clumps are needed .",
    "the first clump should be at @xmath161 and with an over - density of factor @xmath162 . in order to have a similar effect as a spherical density bump",
    ", the clump must replace all the emitting material , i.e. its size ( radius ) , @xmath163 , must be large enough so that its mass is larger than the swept up mass at that radius within an angle of @xmath109 around the line of sight : @xmath164 cm .",
    "an upper limit on the size of the clump can be put from the fact that the bump in the light curve decays on a time scale @xmath165 . since @xmath166 for an ism , this implies @xmath167 ( lazzati et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtain a similar clump size using different considerations ) .    assuming a homogeneous distribution of clumps with the same physical size and over - density ,",
    "the mean distance between neighboring clumps is @xmath168 cm , where the numerical estimate assumes @xmath169 , in which case the clumps hold roughly @xmath170 of the volume and @xmath171 of the mass ( these are lower limits as @xmath172 would imply larger filling factors ) .",
    "therefore , soon after the collision with the first clump we expect overlap between pulses from different clumps , where the number of clumps that intersect a given shell with a radius r and angular size @xmath173 is @xmath174 . since , on average , the clumps hold a constant fraction of the shell s mass , a single clump constitute a fraction @xmath175 of the matter at this radius .",

    "such a profile may arise due to refreshed shocks .",
    "however , the continues increase in @xmath19 requires a continuous arrival of new shells , a scenario which we consider as unlikely .",
    "the energy profiles obtained for @xmath155 and @xmath181 could reflect irregular patches with an initial angular size of @xmath182rad and an average energy of several times @xmath177 .",
    "the energy fluctuations decrease with time , as expected from a patchy shell ( see figure [ fig e ] ) .",
    "the profile obtained for @xmath158 shows an initial rise followed by a gradual ( and bumpy ) decrease back to the initial value .",
    "such a profile can correspond to a line of sight is @xmath183rad away from a hot spot ( the average energy over a large area is @xmath177 ) .",
    "this hot spot may be a hot patch in an irregular jet .",

    "we have presented general expressions for the afterglow light curve when the energy in the blast wave varies with time and for a variable external density profile .",
    "this formalism follows and generalizes the work of spn98 , and relates the variability in the energy and density to the variability in the light curve . despite the variability in the light curve ,",
    "the shape of the broad band spectrum remains the same , with some variability in the values of the break frequencies and flux normalization .",
    "we have focused on the slow cooling spectrum at frequencies @xmath186 , and derived detailed equations for these cases , as they seem the most relevant for the majority of observed optical light curves .",

    "for @xmath189 we find that a variable density hardly induces any fluctuations in the light curve , while a variable energy can induce significant fluctuations .",

    "we applied our formalism to grb 021004 , which displayed significant deviations from a simple power law decay in its optical ( r - band ) light curve .",
    "we find that several different models may provide a reasonable fit to the observed light curve .",
    "these include models where the variability is induced either by density fluctuations or by energy fluctuations , where the latter may be caused either by refreshed shocks or by a patchy angular structure of the grb outflow .",
    "these models vary significantly with the value of @xmath145 .",
    "chandra s observations constrain the electron s index to be @xmath139 , but even under this constrain many different models can produce the observed light curve . a tighter constrain",

    "an independently determined value of @xmath145 , say from the spectrum , would have made this task easier ( but still not completely determined ) .",
    "simultaneous light curves both above and below the cooling frequency , @xmath2 , provide the best way to differentiate between a variable energy and a variable density : for the latter strong variability is possible only below @xmath2 .",

    "this agrees with the observation of rather low @xmath1-ray flux from this burst . the total @xmath1-ray energy , @xmath197ergs is within the standard deviation of the energy distribution presented by frail et .",
    "al ( 2001 ) , but it is 1.5 times smaller than the average value . on the other hand an extrapolation of chandra s measured x - ray flux ( sako et al .",
    "2002 ) to @xmath198hr after the burst yields @xmath199 .",
    "this value is 1.5 times larger than the narrowly clustered value of @xmath200 in other bursts : @xmath201 ( piran et .",
    "al . 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux reflects @xmath202 , the kinetic energy of the relativistic ejecta ( averaged over an angular scale @xmath173 corresponding to @xmath203 ) . hence , in this burst @xmath204 is larger by a factor of 2.25 than the average value .",
    "this factor is similar to the energy fluctuations we find in the patchy shell model for @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig e ] ) . while in most grbs that show a larger value of @xmath204 we ,",
    "most likely , observe a @xmath1-rays hot spot ( piran 2001 ) .",
    "according to this interpretation grb 021004 is the first burst in which a clear @xmath1-ray cold spot has been seen .",
    "jg thanks the hebrew university for hospitality while this research was done .",
    "this work was partially supported by the horwitz foundation ( en ) and by the institute for advanced study , funds for natural sciences ( jg ) .    because of the curvature of the afterglow shock , that is spherical rather than planar , photons that are emitted from the shock front at the same time in the source rest frame ( i.e. at the same radius ) , but at different angles from the line of sight , reach the observer at different times .",
    "this causes two main effects : first , the bulk of the energy that is emitted at a given time at the source is delayed compared to a photon emitted on the line of sight at that time , and second , at any given time the observer receives photons that were emitted at different radii .",
    "in our analysis we take the first effect ( angular time delay ) into account ( see eq .",
    "[ eq tobs ] ) , but the second effect ( angular smoothing ) is neglected ( see nakar & piran 2003 for a solution of the spherical symmetric afterglow light curve that takes a full account of the angular effects ) .",
    "for spherical shells , the angular smoothing produces an observed light curve which is a smoothed version of the line of sight emission .",
    "the relative importance of angular smoothing is determined by the ratio @xmath205 , where @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "when the external density decays as a power law , @xmath208 , the line of sight time is : @xmath209 .",
    "most of the contribution to the observed flux at a time @xmath210 , comes from emission at radii @xmath211 , which correspond to @xmath212 .",
    "hence , this effect is important when the light curve from the line of sight varies significantly ( compared to the smooth power law decay ) on time scales shorter than @xmath213 ( i.e. @xmath214 ) , which corresponds to density variations on @xmath215 . in such a case",
    "the observed light curve is significantly less variable than the line of sight light curve .",
    "we calculate the density profile assuming that the observed ( smoothed ) light curve is similar to that from the line of sight .",
    "thus , the real density profile has to be more variable than the one we obtain .",
    "the difference between the two is smaller when the density profile increases with radius , and the emission along the line of sight increases with time ( compared to the power law decay ) . in this case , the observed flux is dominated by emission from large radii , near the line of sight ( with a relatively small contribution from large angles , for which the emission took place at smaller radii , where the external density was relatively low ) and the angular smoothing effect is less important .",
    "however , when the density drops , the angular effect becomes important .",
    "panaitescu & kumar ( 2000 ) have shown that even a sharp drop in the density produces only a gradual temporal decay in the observed light curve , and that the angular smoothing dictates a maximal power law index of the temporal decay at late times .",
    "the observed r - band light curve of grb 021004 shows variations on time scales of @xmath216 , therefore the angular smoothing effect is not negligible .",
    "this effect can be seen by comparing our density profile to the density profile obtained by lazzati et al .",
    "2002 ( their fig .",
    "1 ) , which take the angular smoothing effect into account .",
    "the main difference between the profiles is in the sharp density drop after the first density bump ( the density in the profile of lazzati et al .",
    "drops to one order of magnitude below the initial density , while our profile drops back to the initial density ) .",
    "this sharp drop is required , when the angular smoothing is considered , in order to obtain the steep temporal decay in the light curve after the first bump ( @xmath217sec ) .",
    "this last result is obtained under the assumption of a full spherical symmetry .",
    "however , it is more likely that the overdense regions are concentrated in clumps and not in spherical shells ( see section 3.1 and lazzati et al .",
    "the radial size of the first clump is @xmath218 , where @xmath219 and @xmath220 are the radius and lorentz factor of the blast - wave when it first interacts with the clump . if we assume that the clump is spherical then its angular size is @xmath221 and at the beginning of the first bump ( @xmath222sec ) it `` fills '' most of the observed region ( the region within an angle of @xmath173 around the line of sight ) . as the dominant emission is from the hot clump , the angular time remains constant , @xmath223 , while @xmath224 grows .",
    "therefore , the angular smoothing effect becomes less and less important , and the approximation which neglects this effect holds better than for a spherically symmetric external density profile . therefore , in this scenario , our method yields a good approximation for the actual density profile at radius @xmath154 , averaged over an angle of @xmath225 around the line of sight .",
