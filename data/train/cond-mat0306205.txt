( upper panel ) and by @xmath102 and @xmath103 ( bottom panel ) compared with the minimum - energy structures ( dotted lines).,width=272 ]    we now turn to an examination of the role of the additional mode @xmath101 in the anomalous negative - pressure behavior of pbtio@xmath0 .",

    "thus , inclusion of the additional mode @xmath101 is not absolutely necessary to produce the anomalous negative - pressure behavior . on the other hand",
    ", neglecting this mode leads to a substantial quantitative error in the transition pressure .",
    "moreover , as we have already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vol - p](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : coef - p ] , the inclusion of the mode @xmath101 is needed to correctly capture the variation of the atomic displacements with pressure .",
    "this point is emphasized in fig .",
    "[ fig : projec - u ] . in the upper panel ,",
    "the ratios of the displacements are fixed with an overall amplitude proportional to @xmath100 ( shown with symbols ) , so that it is impossible to reproduce the crossing in the oxygen displacement pattern around @xmath54 . in the lower panel ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath101 mode yields a qualitative improvement , with a crossing close to @xmath54 .",
    "the discrepancy between the model and the first - principles results ( shown with dotted lines ) grows much more noticeable above @xmath54 .",
    "this most likely reflects the contribution of the neglected modes and couplings to the strong pressure dependence above @xmath54 , which is underestimated by the model .",
    "finally , we analyze the relation between the modes of the centrosymmetric tetragonal structure ( dependent on pressure ) and the modes @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath99 , used in the construction of our model . in our discussion of fig .  [",
    "fig : freq2 ] in sec .",
    "iiib , we noted that the tetragonal mode of intermediate hardness crosses from positive to negative @xmath73 ( i.e. , from stable to unstable behavior ) at a pressure very close to that at which the anomalous structural response occurs .",
    "projecting the pressure - dependent tetragonal modes on the cubic modes , we find that the tetragonal soft mode is mainly described by the mode @xmath100 at all pressures , with a significant contribution of the mode @xmath99 above @xmath54 , whereas the tetragonal mode of intermediate hardness is mainly described at lower pressures by the mode @xmath99 , and then above @xmath54 by the mode @xmath101 . since the kinky behavior occurs even when both cubic - structure modes @xmath101 and @xmath99 are frozen to zero amplitude , we think that it is unlikely that the zero crossing of the second tetragonal - structure mode has a _ causal _ role in the anomalous structural behavior .",
    "instead , it seems more likely that it simply _ results _ from the abrupt expansion of the @xmath28-axis lattice parameter .",
    "thus , we believe that the model developed in this section , based on an expansion of the total energy with respect to the volume and two zone - center mode amplitudes , is a reasonable compromise between simplicity and accuracy .",
    "it gives a good qualitative and even semi - quantitative description of the abrupt variation of the structural parameters near @xmath54 .",
    "the fact that it predicts a true first - order transition at @xmath54 , instead of a smooth but  kinky \" cross - over , should be taken more as a sign of the proximity of the real system to a phase transition than as a failure of the model .",
    "we are hopeful that this model will be useful for investigating and describing similar behavior in other perovskite systems .",
    "we have shown that the application of negative pressure induces a large enhancement of tetragonal strain in tetragonal pbtio@xmath0 .",
    "specifically , in a window of pressure centered around a particular value @xmath54 , @xmath5 abruptly increases , and all structural parameters exhibit a corresponding  jump \" that suggests proximity to a phase transition .    to describe this unexpected behavior in pbtio@xmath0 , we have generated a phenomenological model from our _ ab  initio _ results , based on an expansion of the total energy with respect to a carefully selected subset of the structural degrees of freedom .",
    "this has led to the identification of a phase boundary , analogous to the liquid - gas phase boundary , in the model parameter space . with the parameters obtained from fitting to first - principles total energies of pbtio@xmath0 ,",
    "the model predicts not just a  kinky \" behavior , but a true first - order transition at a critical pressure @xmath54 close to the pressure at which the anomaly occurs in the first - principles calculations .",
    "we found that a tiny variation of one parameter is sufficient to drive the model through a triple point and bring it to a transition - free portion of parameter space where the  kinky \" behavior is qualitatively well - reproduced .",
    "it might become possible to realize such variations of effective model parameters by some combination of `` external fields '' such as chemical substitution , temperature , epitaxial stress , or homogeneous electric field .",
    "if so , one might develop experimental techniques for turning the transition off or on , tuning the associated transition properties , and perhaps even exploring the region of the triple point itself .",
    "finally , we speculate that this  anomalous \" behavior of the structural parameters of tetragonal pbtio@xmath0 could be a more general feature in perovskite oxides . for example",
    ", we have found that the same anomalous behavior is also present in batio@xmath0 with imposed tetragonal symmetry ( though at much higher negative pressure ) , so that a similar phase boundary could be explored in this portion of perovskite parameter space .",
    "the possibility of analogous transitions in other abo@xmath0 perovskites is under investigation .",
    "this could present tantalizing opportunities for designing perovskite - based materials with large and controllable strain variations .",
