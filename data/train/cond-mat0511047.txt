    "the problem of phonon excitations have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally in mixed crystals @xcite as well as in insulators @xcite . however , there are far fewer studies of lattice thermal conductivity in disordered alloys .",
    "detailed comparison between theory and experiment on the basis of realistic models has not been extensive .",
    "model calculations are mostly based on mass disorder , whereas in phonon problems essential off - diagonal disorder in the force constants can not be dealt within single site mean - field approximations .",
    "such disorder can not be ignored in a realistic calculation .    in the past few decades",
    ", there has been considerable attention directed towards the theoretical understanding of the lattice thermal conductivity of metals .",
    "these are mainly due to the efforts of klemens @xcite , ziman @xcite , callaway @xcite , parrot @xcite and others . however majority of these were based on model calculations , either for perfect crystals or ordered alloys .",
    "flicker and leath @xcite first proposed the calculation of lattice thermal conductivity within a single - site coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) using the appropriate kubo formula .",
    "the single - site cpa is a mean field approximation , capable of dealing with mass disorder alone and is not adequate for treating intrinsic off - diagonal disorder arising out of the force constants .",
    "this was evidenced in the inability of the single site cpa to explain experimental life time data on nipt @xcite .",
    "translationally invariant , multiple site , multiple scattering theories based on the augmented space formalism  @xcite have recently been proposed by ghosh  @xcite as well as by us @xcite to describe phonons in a series of random alloy systems : nipt , nipd and nicr .",
    "these formalisms explicitly capture the effects of both the diagonal and off - diagonal disorder .    in this paper , we shall first introduce a kubo - greenwood type formula which relates the thermal conductivity to the ( heat ) current - current correlation function .",
    "the ideas used here are very similar to those proposed by allen and feldman @xcite except that the present formulation is done keeping in mind the application to a substitutionally disordered crystal , rather than an amorphous system . for disordered alloys , configuration averaging over various random atomic arrangements",
    "have been carried out using the augmented space formalism ( asf ) introduced by us @xcite .",
    "the asf goes beyond the usual mean - field approaches and takes into account configuration fluctuations over a large local environment .",
    "we shall combine the augmented space representation for phonons @xcite with a scattering diagrammatic technique to get an effective heat current .",
    "this effective current consists in addition to the averaged current term , also the terms arising out of the disorder scattering corrections .",
    "we will show that these disorder induced corrections to the averaged current terms are directly related either to the disorder scattering induced self - energy matrix in the propagator or to vertex corrections .",
    "as far as the vertex corrections are concerned , leath @xcite had obtained these corrections within the framework of cpa by using diagram summations . in this paper",
    "we shall derive the contribution of these corrections in a more generalized context with the inclusion of diagonal as well as the intrinsic off - diagonal disorder arising out of the dynamical matrix .",
    "since in an earlier communication @xcite we have already shown that the self energy matrix and the green matrix can be calculated for realistic binary alloys within an augmented space block recursion ( asbr ) technique , so the present formulation will form the basis of a subsequent calculation of lattice thermal conductivity in realistic alloys .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
