    "the connection between starburst and seyfert activity is one of the most hotly debated issues in the context of agns .",
    "a variety of data have provided growing evidence that starburst and seyfert phenomenon often coexist ( cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 , delgado and perez 1993 , genzel et al .",
    "1995 , heckman et al .",

    "1987 , storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "1996 , cid fernandes et al .",
    "1997 ) . however , most of these studies have detected star forming activity , and/or a young stellar population in seyfert galaxies ( especially type 2 ) on the kpc scale , which might not be directly relevant to the active nucleus . indeed , maiolino et al .",
    "( 1997 ) speculate that star formation in the host galaxy of seyfert 2 nuclei is probably related only indirectly to the active nucleus : non  axisymmetric morphologies ( bars / distortions / interactions ) are likely to be the prime cause of the relationship , as they both enhance star formation in the galaxy and drive gas into the nuclear region to obscure the active nucleus .",
    "terlevich and collaborators ( terlevich & melnick 1985 , terlevich et al . 1992 , 1995 , terlevich 1994 ) have proposed a much closer link between nuclear star formation and seyfert activity .",
    "they claim that the whole phenomenology observed in agn can be accounted for by assuming that these nuclei are powered by a massive nuclear starburst evolving in the metal rich environment of early type galaxies : the ionizing radiation emitted by an extreme population of wolf  rayet stars , along with fast shocks generated by sne , would produce the spectrum observed in sy galaxies . so far , very few observational tests of this theory have been made , due to difficulties in probing star formation and stellar populations in the innermost region of agns . however , recently heckman et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have discovered a powerful , young ( in the wolf - rayet phase ) nuclear starburst in the sy2 galaxy mkn477 ; such a nuclear starburst might dominate the bolometric luminosity of the central region , therefore partly supporting terlevich s scenario , at least in this object .",
    "norman & scoville ( 1988 ) , following bailey(1980 ) and david ( 1987a , b ) , have proposed a different link between the nuclear stellar population and agn . according to their model , a young nuclear ( @xmath7 10 pc ) star cluster would return mass into the interstellar medium , by means of post - main - sequence stars , that would feed a nuclear black hole .",
    "an analogous model has been proposed more recently by murphy et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , who also include effects of tidial disruption of stars close to the black hole .",
    "jenkins & binney ( 1994 ) have proposed a similar mechanism for the fueling of the galactic center .",
    "again , these models have not been tested , so far , due to the shortage of observations that can probe the nuclear stellar population .",
    "the circinus galaxy is a nearby ( 4 mpc ) , edge  on ( incl.@xmath665@xmath8 ) , sb  d system that is seen through a low interstellar extinction window near the galactic plane ( @xmath9 = 1.5 mag , freeman et al . 1977 ) .",
    "the nuclear optical line ratios ( oliva et al . 1994 ) are typical of a seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "the seyfert 2 classification is supported also by the detection of intense coronal lines ( oliva et al .",
    "1994 , moorwood et al .",
    "1996a ) , the discovery of an intense x  ray iron 6.7 kev line ( matt et al .",
    "1996 ) , rapid variation of the powerful h@xmath10o maser emission ( greenhill et al .",
    "1997 ) and a prominent ionization cone in the [ oiii]@xmath115007 maps ( marconi et al .",
    "1995 ) , with filamentary supersonic outflows ( veilleux & bland - hawthorn 1997 ) . the large equivalent width of the fe 6.7 kev line detected by asca ( ew @xmath6 2 kev ) indicates that the nucleus is heavily absorbed along the line of sight : @xmath12 , i.e it is compton thick .",
    "the circinus galaxy is also characterized by enhanced star forming activity : h@xmath13 and [ sii ] narrow band images ( marconi et al . 1995 ) have revealed the presence of a star forming ring at a radius of @xmath610@xmath14=200pc .",
    "given its proximity and the coexistence of both star formation and an active nucleus , the circinus galaxy appears to be one of the most suitable objects to tackle the starburst ",
    "agn connection issue .",
    "in this paper we present high angular resolution near  ir images and integral field spectroscopic data that probe the physics of the nuclear region of the circinus galaxy , on scales from a few parsecs to @xmath6 100 pc . using these data ,",
    "we investigate the properties of the active nucleus and its interaction with the circumnuclear environment , with emphasis on the connection between seyfert and stellar activity .",
    "the nucleus of the circinus galaxy was observed in march and april 1996 with 3d , the mpe near  ir imaging spectrometer ( weitzel et al . 1996 ) , assisted by rogue , a first order adaptive optics system ( thatte et al .",
    "1995 ) , at the 2.2 m mpe  eso telescope . 3d",
    "slices the focal plane into 16 slits and disperses their light in wavelength ; the spectrum of the slices is then imaged onto a nicmos3 detector ( 256@xmath15256 pixels ) .",
    "the resulting `` cube '' provides simultaneous spectra of an area @xmath16 , as projected on the sky , divided into 16@xmath1516 pixels ( i.e. @xmath17/pix ) .",
    "we observed circinus in two different spectral configurations : in march ( two nights ) we observed the whole k band at a spectral resolution of r=1000 , while in april ( four nights ) we observed the spectral region around the co stellar bands ( 2.22.4@xmath18 ) at a spectral resolution of r=2000 .",
    "the fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) during the observations , after the tip tilt correction , was about @xmath19 in the k band .",
    "one of the nights in april had an optical seeing of @xmath20 , while the seeing in the k band , after tip tilt correction , was about @xmath21 , though we could not determine it accurately because of heavy undersampling of the psf .",
    "we observed a nearby o star to correct the atmospheric transmission features in the r=1000 data , as o stars are almost featureless in the k band , while we observed an a star to correct the r=2000 data , as a stars are featureless in the corresponding spectral region .",
    "data reduction was performed as described in weitzel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and thatte et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we also observed the circinus galaxy by means of sharp , the mpe speckle near - ir imaging camera at the ntt eso telescope , in april 1996 .",
    "this camera uses a nicmos3 array with a pixel scale of 0.05@xmath14/pix ( providing a field of view of @xmath22 ) .",
    "we observed the central region of circinus in h and k bands at a frame rate of 1 hz . the observations of circinus were interleaved with observations of a reference star ( about the same magnitude as the circinus nucleus ) to monitor the psf .",
    "the individual images were background subtracted , flat fielded , shifted to center the brightest speckle and then co - added .",
    "details on the data reduction are given in eckart et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1995 ) .",
    "the k band images have a psf of 0.2@xmath14 fwhm ; however , if the diffuse , seeing limited psf is subtracted , the central spike is close to the diffraction limit ( @xmath23 fwhm ) . in h ,",
    "the psf is slightly worse : 0.27@xmath14 fwhm .",
    "this section is aimed at showing general results extracted from the data , to provide an overview of the features observed in the central region of the circinus galaxy .",
    "a more detailed analysis is given in sect.4 & 5 .",
    "fig.1a shows the k  band sharp image of the central region of circinus , smoothed with a 3 pixel ( 0.15@xmath14 ) fwhm gaussian to improve the s / n on the low surface brightness features ; while fig.1b shows the central 3@xmath14 at full resolution .",
    "the k band image shows a two armed spiral  like morphology .",
    "the western arm is also apparent in the 7000 @xmath24image ( marconi et al .",
    "1995 ) , but the southern arm is less evident in the optical image , which might be partly due to obscuration towards the south  east ( see below ) and partly to lack of angular resolution in the optical images . in the central region ( r@xmath780 pc ) the surface brightness distribution is smoother and rises slowly toward the k peak , with a shallow power law ( surface brightness @xmath25 with @xmath26 0.5 - 0.7 ) .",
    "this central region ( r@xmath7 80 pc ) bay be considered as the inner part of a bulge ( a `` nuclear bulge '' , in analogy with our galaxy , mezger et al .",
    "1996 ) , though in this galaxy an outer bulge seems to be absent or very faint .",
    "the nuclear k band spike is unresolved and is most likely due to emission by hot dust , as we will discuss in sect.4.1",
    ". the hot dust emission might also affect the h band nuclear peak , though this is more difficult to test .",
    "fig.2 shows the h ",
    "k color map . to generate such a map we had to center the k band image relative to the h image .",
    "since the nucleus might be heavily reddened , the peak of the h light might be offset with respect to the k peak .",
    "therefore , we did _ not _ determine the relative position of the two maps by aligning their peaks .",
    "instead , we used both the cross - correlation of the two maps ( excluding the peaks ) and the location of a point source situated north of the nucleus .",
    "k color of an unreddened stellar population does not change significantly as it evolves ; indeed , both spiral and ellipticals show a fairly narrow distribution of the h ",
    "k color , which clusters at 0.22 mags , with a standard deviation of about 0.1 mag ( frogel 1985 , giovanardi & hunt 1996 , hunt et al .",
    "1996 ) . as a consequence , the h ",
    "k excess relative to the standard value traces regions affected by reddening .",
    "this is not the case for the seyfert nucleus , because it has intrinsically redder colors .",
    "moreover , psf differences between h and k make color gradients around the nuclear spike unreliable .",
    "however , that is not a problem for the extended emission , where small variations of the psf do not significantly affect the colors .",
    "fig.2 indicates a color gradient towards the se .",
    "it is unlikely that this gradient is an instrumental effect due to imperfect flat fielding , as we found the same result by using different types of flat fields ( night sky , twilight , and even without any flat field ) .",
    "such a gradient very likely reflects an increase in the extinction towards the se ; this variation of the reddening is expected , as the se is the near side of the galactic disk and therefore the dusty screen is expected to be more effective in this region ( quillen et al . 1995 ) .",
    "however , the most interesting feature is the dust lane that enters the nuclear region from east toward south and twists toward the nucleus by 90 degrees at about 80 pc from the center .",
    "such a dust lane ( @xmath277.8 ) can account almost entirely for the interarm depression near the southern spiral arm observed in the k image ( fig.1a ) , though a stellar spiral component is probably also present .",
    "in fig.1a the solid line box indicates the region sampled by 3d during the r=1000 observations .",
    "fig.3a shows the 3d , r=1000 , spectrum extracted from an aperture of @xmath28 ( = 15pc ) centered on the nucleus .",
    "the spectrum has been rebinned to r@xmath6700 to improve the signal to noise .",
    "most prominent in this spectrum are the coronal lines : [ sivi ] ( ionization energy 167 ev ) , [ caviii ] ( 128 ev)@xmath29 , and [ alix ] ( 285 ev)@xmath29 ; the latter is the first detection in an extragalactic object .",
    "tab.1 lists the fluxes of the lines detected in the nuclear region .",
    "the continuum rising toward longer wavelengths , and the stellar features being much shallower than in normal galaxies , indicates that the non  stellar emission from the active nucleus contributes significantly to the continuum , diluting the stellar features .",
    "we extracted line maps by interpolating the underlying continuum with a first order fit in the @xmath30 around each line ( by excluding regions affected by other lines and stellar features ) .",
    "an accurate continuum subtraction is one of the most critical issues , as the continuum slope and shape changes significantly over the field of view .",
    "fig.4 shows maps of some of the lines detected in the k band spectrum .",
    "the last contour in each map is at 3@xmath31 above the noise .",
    "the [ sivi ] map extends in the direction of the ionization cone traced by the [ oiii ] maps , as indicated by means of yellow dashed lines ( marconi et al .",
    "1995 , veilleux & bland - hawtorn 1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , the br@xmath32 emission is more diffuse and extends also along the major axis of the galaxy ( p.a.@xmath33 , see note 5 ) .",
    "the [ alix ] shows the most compact emission .",
    "the nuclear h@xmath10 emission is elongated towards the west , i.e. along the ionization cone , as [ sivi ] does , but at lower surface brightness levels it also extends towards the ne , along with the br@xmath32 emission .",
    "we will discuss these line maps in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the dashed rectangle in fig.1a indicates the region of the nucleus sampled by the 3d observations at r=2000 .",
    "fig.3b shows the r=2000 nuclear spectrum , extracted from an aperture of @xmath28 . for comparison",
    ", the 3d spectrum of a template star ( m3i ) is shown in fig.3c ( note the expanded scale on the _ y _ axis ) .",
    "we have used such spectra to map the stellar velocity field in the nuclear region of the circinus galaxy .",
    "both the galaxy spectra and the stellar template spectra were continuum subtracted .",
    "then we used two different methods to determine both the velocity of the stellar system and its velocity dispersion .",
    "we first used a method similar to that described in tonry & davis ( 1979 ) : the cross - correlation of the galaxy spectrum with the template star was fitted by the autocorrelation function of the star convolved with a gaussian , whose @xmath31 and peak velocity were free parameters . the second method consisted of fitting the galaxy spectrum in real space with a template stellar spectrum convolved with a gaussian : in this case the fit parameters were the @xmath31 of the gaussian profile , the velocity shift applied to the stellar spectrum , and a multiplicative factor to fit the depth of the stellar features .",
    "fitting was performed by using different stellar templates ( k  m giants and supergiants ) to monitor possible uncertainties introduced by a mismatch between the stellar template and the observed galaxy s stellar population . to minimize these mismatch effects ,",
    "when working in real space , we separately fitted each stellar feature , so that the minimization of the @xmath34 was not limited by differences in the relative depths of the features between the stellar template and the galaxy spectrum .",
    "both fitting methods , i.e. fitting of the cross - correlation function and fitting in real space , gave consistent results .",
    "as the velocity dispersion turns out to be quite low ( @xmath680 km / s ) , i.e close to our resolution element , fitting the higher order moments instead of a simple gaussian ( i.e. the kurtosis h@xmath35 and h@xmath36 ) was found not to be provide additional information when compared to uncertainties .",
    "errors were estimated by determining the variation of the fit parameters that decreased the @xmath34 probability by 68% .",
    "not all the stellar features in the spectrum could be used : the @xmath37co(31 ) band is corrupted by the [ caviii ] emission line ; the @xmath38co(20 ) band is affected by a helium emission line ; the @xmath37co(42 ) band is affected by some atmospheric features or by some unidentified emission line ; the nai doublet is corrupted by some instrumental effect in the nuclear spectrum ( see fig.3b ) , but could be used in other regions .",
    "therefore , we used only the @xmath37co(20 ) band and the cai triplet over the whole field of view , and the nai doublet only in the off nuclear regions ( though the latter does not affect the results significantly ) .",
    "fig.5 shows the map of the stellar peak velocity as derived by fitting a cubic spline to a grid of 21 points obtained by rebinning the field of view of 3d , to improve the signal  to  noise of each spectrum .",
    "the errorbars in the outer regions of the map are @xmath39 .",
    "fig.6 shows the stellar peak velocity and velocity dispersion along the major and minor axis of the galaxy ( p.a . 25@xmath40 and 155@xmath40 respectively ) .",

    "the near  ir images in marconi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) should be less affected by extinction and light from the young stellar population than optical images are .",
    "the major axis of the isophotes of these ir images is at p.a .",
    "we suspect that the optical images are affected by patchy extinction in our galactic plane , especially at the low surface brightness level . indeed ,",
    "the optical images show a weird tilt towards the east of the northern extremity of the galactic disk , which might be due to larger galactic absorption in the northern region .",
    "also , the crowding of galactic sources makes it difficult to identify of the low surface brightness isophotes , probably used to measure the inclination of the galaxy . in this paper",
    "we assume the p.a .",
    "of the major axis to be that determined by means of the nir images of marconi et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , i.e. 25@xmath40 .",
    "however , results do not change significantly if the actual major axis is 30@xmath40 as determined by freeman et al . and elmouttie et al .. ] as measured by means of the 3d spectra ( filled dots ) .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion is roughly constant in the central 100 pc . in fig.6",
    "we also plot , with hollow squares , the peak velocity determined by using the [ nii ] emission line data from oliva et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . ] .",
    "the velocity field along the major axis shows a noticeable rotation pattern .",
    "the shallow stellar features in the nuclear k band spectrum , the slope of the spectrum ( fig.3 ) and the extremely red colors of the nucleus indicate that the non  stellar emission from the seyfert nucleus contributes significantly to the radiation observed in the nuclear region and that it dilutes the stellar features . as discussed by several authors ( efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ef95 , granato & danese 1994 gd94 , oliva et al .",
    "1995 , thatte et al .",
    "1997 , pier & krolik 1993 pk93 , mcalary & rieke 1988 ) , such k band radiation from seyfert nuclei is very likely emitted by hot dust , at temperatures close to the sublimation limit ( @xmath6 1500 k ) , heated by the intense uv radiation field emitted by the seyfert source . as a consequence",
    ", the k band images can not be used to trace the stellar light in the nuclear region .",
    "the h band nuclear peak is also likely to be affected by hot dust emission ( thatte et al .",
    "1997 , oliva et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "however , the co stellar bands provide information about the fraction of the nuclear flux that is stellar . by assuming that the intrinsic equivalent width of the co bands of the stellar population in the nuclear region is the same as in the circumnuclear region ( r @xmath6 5070 pc ) , where the contribution of the nuclear hot dust source is absent",
    ", we can then use the measured ew(co ) on the nucleus to provide the amount of non - stellar dilution , or the fraction of the observed radiation that actually comes from stars . as the mass  to ",
    "light ratio turns out not to change significantly within the central @xmath6200 pc ( sect.5.2 and fig.11 ) , the intrinsic ew of the co stellar bands is not expected to change much within the central region .",
    "therefore , the fraction of the stellar light in the nuclear region can be reliably estimated in the way we just described , with an accuracy of about 20% .",
    "in fig.7 we show the k - band surface brightness profile around the nuclear peak as derived from the sharp image ( filled dots and solid line ) , normalized to its peak intensity , compared with the fraction of stellar light ( hollow circles ) as derived by means of the co stellar bands . the innermost point for the stellar light fraction",
    "is determined by extracting the 3d spectrum from an aperture of @xmath42 ( 6 pc ) from the data of the night with best seeing ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the dotted line indicates a fit to the stellar data using a modified king profile .",
    "it is noticeable that most of the nuclear emission is indeed non  stellar . if such a nuclear non ",
    "stellar source were unresolved , then the observed k  band profile should be the sum of the shallow stellar profile and a nuclear psf , the latter being normalized to the peak value of the non stellar light ( the psf with this normalization is plotted with hollow squares connected by a long - dashed line ) .",
    "the sum of these components is indicated by the short - dashed line in fig.7 and , within uncertainties , it is identical to the observed k profile . therefore , the non  stellar k ",
    "band source is point like at our resolution , i.e. it has a radius _ smaller than 1.5 pc . _",
    "if circinus were a type 1 seyfert such a result would not be surprising , as the size of the region containing dust close to the sublimation limit is much smaller than 1 pc .",

    "( 1996a ) estimate an intrinsic luminosity of the seyfert nucleus of @xmath44 , therefore , by assuming the grain mixtures given in rowan - robinson ( 1986 ) , we derive a size of the hot ( 1500 k ) dust region @xmath45 pc . in case of type",
    "2 seyferts the modelling is more complex .",
    "according to the unified model ( antonucci 1993 ) the nuclear hot dust should be partly obscured by the dense circumnuclear molecular torus .",
    "therefore , the observed non ",
    "stellar near ir light should be partly associated with the short  wavelength tail of the mid - ir emission , and partly to radiation from the nuclear hot dust transmitted through the torus , the relative contribution of the two components being dependent on the optical thickness of the torus .",
    "various authors have modelled the radiative transfer processes through the putative torus to determine the expected ir emission from type 2 seyferts ( pk93 , gd94 , er95 ) . in the model used by granato et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to fit the ir spectrum of ngc 1068 , the size of the 2.2@xmath1 m source is expected to be @xmath46 ( at a brightness level of 30% of the peak ) .",

    "siebenmorgen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have proposed a spherically symmetric model to specifically fit the ir emission from circinus nucleus .",
    "however , their model predicts a size of 44.5 pc ( in radius ) for the emitting region in the near  ir : such a value is 3 times larger than our upper limit at 2.2@xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the axisymmetric geometry expected from the unified model better fits the observational constraints in terms of size of the emitting region in the near  ir .    in tab.2",
    "we compare the luminosity of the non stellar nuclear k component , as determined from our data , along with the luminosity in the l@xmath47 ( 3.8@xmath18 ) , m ( 4.8@xmath18 ) and n(10.3@xmath18 ) bands from siebenmorgen et al .",

    "the continuum rises steeply toward longer wavelengths .",

    "more specifically , given that the light cone in circinus is quite wide ( opening angle @xmath48 ) , er95 s model can reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution only if the torus is highly inclined , so that it can significantly self - absorb the near  ir emitting region .      as discussed by several authors ( korista & ferland 1989 , oliva et al .",

    "1996 ) , the coronal lines observed in agns are most likely emitted by gas highly ionized by the hard uv  x ray nuclear radiation .",
    "our [ sivi ] map ( fig.4b ) , showing the coronal line emission extending into the narrow line region , supports such a picture .",
    "however , the scenario is more complex .",
    "the [ sivi ] ( 167 ev ) coronal line emission map extends preferentially in the western direction , up to @xmath6 50 pc from the nucleus .",
    "instead , the emission region of the [ alix ] ( 285 ev ) line is much more compact ( fig.4c ) and , if any , it is only barely resolved .",
    "this is better illustrated by fig.8 , where we plot the radial surface brightness of [ sivi ] , [ alix ] and of the psf , within the sector @xmath49 .",
    "the [ alix ] radial profile departs from the psf only by 1@xmath31 , while [ sivi ] is clearly resolved .",
    "also , fig.8 indicates that the ionization state of the narrow line region changes with radius in the western direction : at about 20 pc the [ alix]/[sivi ] ratio is 2.7 times lower than on the nucleus at a confidence level of 5@xmath31 .",
    "the difference is less pronunced in the northern part of the ionization cone , where the [ sivi ] surface brightness drops faster and whose radial profile is closer to that of [ alix ] .",
    "possibly , the western part of the radiation cone ( p.a .",
    "@xmath50 ) intercepts the dense , circumnuclear molecular clouds in the galactic plane , thereby lowering the ionization parameter lower20 pc ) that we are considering here , the plane parallel slab model is a good enough approximation for the clouds in the galactic disk that are illuminated by the agn continuum . ] and increasing the emissivity of the coronal lines ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this would explain the lower [ alix]/[sivi ] ratio in this region and the enhanced [ sivi ] emission with respect to the northern part of the ionization cone .",
    "another possibility is that the ionization mechanism is different in the western extension .",
    "collisional ionization , due to fast shocks , could contribute in this region .",
    "however , oliva ( 1997 ) , oliva et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and marconi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that ionization of the coronal gas as a consequence of fast shocks is very unlikely in agns , and specifically in circinus .    finally , it is interesting to note that the peak of the [ sivi ] emission is slightly shifted , by @xmath52 ( = 3pc ) , with respect to the k band nucleus and to the peak of the br@xmath32 and [ alix ] emission . although higher resolution data are required to confirm such a finding , it is worthwhile to compare this result with the ionization structure expected to occur in the ( inner ) coronal line region ( clr ) .",
    "as discussed in marconi et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , if the clr is `` thick '' for si@xmath53 , i.e. the he@xmath54 continuum opacity is responsible for determining its ionization structure , the peak of the [ sivi ] emission should occur at the he@xmath55 strmgren radius , i.e. @xmath56(peak ) } = \\left [ q(he^+ ) \\over n_e^2 \\alpha_b(he^+ )     \\right ] ^{1/3}\\ ] ] ( assuming a filling factor close to unity ) . by using the parameters for the circinus clr given in moorwood et al .",

    "such gas , responsible for the nuclear coronal emission lines , must intercept only a fraction of the nuclear solid angle , allowing the uv  x radiation to ionize gas in the outer light cone .",
    "a more detailed discussion on the coronal emission lines , including the [ caviii ] line ( which requires a careful subtraction of the underlying stellar features ) and their kinematical properties , will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "there are three main mechanisms that may be responsible for the emission of the h@xmath10 lines observed in the near ir .",
    "these lines can be excited thermally in hot gas , either heated by shocks ( hollenbach & shull 1977 , draine 1980 , draine et al .",
    "1983 ) or by intense x  ray radiation ( lepp & mccray 1983 , maloney & hollenbach 1996 , tin et al .",
    "1997 ) , or can be emitted under fluorescent excitation conditions if the uv radiation field is strong enough ( black & van dishoeck 1988 , sternberg 1988 ) .",
    "near ir spectroscopy of agn and starburst galaxies has indicated that uv fluorescence pumping is unlikely to play a major role in most of these objects ( moorwood & oliva 1990 , sugai et al .",
    "1997 ) , and therefore thermal excitation must prevail .",
    "however , sternberg & dalgarno ( 1989 ) , have studied the uv excitation with a more detailed model and found that _",
    "i _ ) the uv field can contribute to the gas heating and _ ii _ ) when the gas densities are higher than 10@xmath60 collisional de - excitation of the h@xmath10 levels becomes important , and the emitted spectrum resembles the thermal case .",
    "the maps of the h@xmath10 emission from the circinus galaxy ( figs.4.d - e ) indicate that the nuclear emission is elongated 1020 pc towards the west , i.e. in the same direction as the x  ray excited [ sivi ] line .",
    "however , this is not sufficient evidence to support x  ray heating , as the uv field in this direction is also intense .",
    "moreover , at lower surface brightness levels the h@xmath10 emission also extends in the ne direction , i.e. it extends in the same direction as the br@xmath32 emission ( @xmath61 uv radiation ) , which probably traces star forming activity ( sect.5.1 ) .",
    "the h@xmath10 line ratios help to better understand between various excitation mechanisms .",
    "the curves in the diagrams on the left side of fig.9 show the expected fluxes of some of the h@xmath10 lines , relative to h@xmath10(10)s(1 ) , as a function of temperature , for pure thermal excitation .",
    "the dots in the diagrams on the right side show the same ratios according to the combined uv pumping+thermal models of sternberg & dalgarno ( 1989 ) , as a function of gas density , for their @xmath62 parameter ( proportional to the intensity of the uv radiation ) ranging from 10 to 10@xmath29 ; except for the case of ( 10)q(1 ) , for which only the case @xmath63 is given in their paper .",
    "the hatched areas indicate the ratios observed on the nucleus , and their thickness give the @xmath64 range .",
    "the lightly  shaded areas indicate the ratios observed in an aperture @xmath6 20 pc ne of the nucleus .",
    "the observed ( 21)s(1)/(10)s(1 ) ratio clearly rules out pure uv pumping ( the low density regime of sternberg & dalgarno s models ) as the excitation mechanism in both regions .",
    "thermal excitation fits the data of the h@xmath10 nuclear emission , within @xmath65 , if the gas has a temperature of about 2500 k. for the uv+thermal models the agreement with the nuclear line ratios is worse , this is because in the very high density , quasi - thermal regime the molecular gas reaches temperatures that are too low ( @xmath61000 k ) .",
    "however , we can not exclude that by varying the parameters in sternberg & dalgarno s model a better agreement can be obtained .",
    "the similar western extension of the h@xmath10 and [ sivi ] lines , together with these results suggests that the nuclear h@xmath10 lines are mostly emitted thermally in gas heated by the x  ray , and possibly uv , radiation emitted by the agn . if this were also the case for other agns ( e.g. ngc4945 , moorwood et al .",
    "1996b ) , then the h@xmath10 emission line distribution in active nuclei would not necessarily trace the distribution of molecular gas , but it would also reflect the distribution of the x  ray radiation field .    in the ne off ",
    "nuclear region , where extended br@xmath32 emission is seen , the thermal model reproduces poorly the observed h@xmath10 line intensities , as different line ratios measure different temperatures . in this region",
    "uv pumping might contribute to the gas excitation .",
    "more specifically , sternberg & dalgarno s model could fit the observed ratios if the gas density is close to the transition between uv  fluorescence and thermal regimes , i.e. @xmath66 .      as illustrated in fig.6 , within the central 100 pc",
    "the bulge is isothermal within uncertainties .",
    "the smallest aperture over which we can sample the velocity dispersion is given by the seeing during the observations , i.e. @xmath67 (= 1012 pc ) .",
    "though on one night the seeing was as good as @xmath43 , data from that night alone do not have a high enough signal  to  noise to sample the stellar velocity dispersion within the innermost @xmath42 , also due to higher dilution from the hot dust component in the central aperture .",
    "following kormendy ( 1988 ) and kormendy & richstone ( 1995 ) , we extracted the spectrum of the nuclear stellar cluster ( r@xmath76pc ) , cleaned of the bulge contribution , by subtracting the mean of the spectra at @xmath6817 pc along the minor axis ( which have the same velocity shift as the nucleus ) .",
    "the resulting stellar spectrum has a velocity dispersion of @xmath69 .",
    "the velocity dispersion is lower in the nuclear region indicating that we do not detect a nuclear point  like concentration of mass ( binney & tremaine , 1987 ) . by assuming the nuclear stellar cluster to have a virialized , isotropic distribution and a king core radius of 10 pc ,",
    "as derived from fig.7 , we estimate an upper limit of @xmath70 to any compact concentration of mass . the crucial point , as we will show in sect.5.2 ,",
    "is that such a nuclear mass is _ not _ associated with a mass  to  light ratio higher than that of the circumnuclear region , as would be expected in the case of a nuclear concentration of dark mass significant with respect to the stellar mass .",
    "if the agn is powered by an accreting black hole , then our upper limit on the black hole mass indicates that the agn is radiating at a rate ( @xmath71 , moorwood et al .",

    "the corrected m / l@xmath88 ratio can not be lower than that expected by the model , and this constrains the maximum differential extinction to be a@xmath145(stars)a@xmath145(nlr ) @xmath79 30 mag .",
    "the derived bolometric luminosity changes as a consequence of two competitive factors : _",
    "i ) _ l@xmath88(corrected ) increases , but _",
    "ii ) _ @xmath146 decreases as a consequence of the older age .",
    "the net behaviour is an increase of l@xmath133 , as shown in fig.13 .",
    "the corrected l@xmath133 could be as high as @xmath147 , for a differential extinction of 30 mags .",
    "moorwood et al .",
    "( 1996a ) estimate the lyman continuum luminosity by using the h@xmath13 flux from a `` resolved '' cloud in the nlr , whose _ projected _ distance from the nucleus is known .",
    "however , there are a few factors which lead to an underestimate of the real l@xmath148 : _ i ) _ a fraction of the h@xmath13 flux from the cloud might be lost as a consequence of dust extinction within the cloud , _ ii ) _ a fraction of the ionizing photon flux might be absorbed by dust in front of or within the cloud , _",
    "iii ) _ the distance of the cloud from the nucleus might be larger than the observed projection , _ iv ) _ the cloud might be made up of subclumps or filaments , i.e. the effective area of the cloud might be lower than observed . if the real l@xmath148 is higher than that estimated by moorwood et al .",
    "( 1996a ) , then in sect.5.1 we have undercorrected the nuclear ew(br@xmath32 ) when accounting for the covering factor .",
    "therefore , correcting the l@xmath148 for effects _",
    "iv _ makes the nuclear ew(br@xmath32 ) larger and makes the derived age for the cluster younger , as shown in fig.14 .",
    "the maximum value of the ew(br@xmath32 ) predicted by the model imposes a maximum correction to the lyman continuum luminosity : l@xmath148(corrected)/l@xmath148(observed ) @xmath79 13 .",
    "correcting l@xmath148 affects both the derived l@xmath133 ( because of the younger age of the cluster ) and the bolometric luminosity of the agn ( because the total l@xmath148 is the normalizing factor of the sed derived by moorwood et al .",
    "the net effect is a decrease of the ratio l@xmath133/l@xmath149(agn ) .",
    "the most extreme correction would imply a very young nuclear cluster ( @xmath150 ) which radiates about 8% of the luminosity of the seyfert nucleus .    summarizing ,",
    "if we assume that a compact nuclear starburst is responsible for most of the br@xmath32 emission of the seyfert nucleus , the starburst must be as young as @xmath142 , in fair agreement with the expectation of terlevich s model , but the bolometric luminosity of the starburst is only 20% of the observed luminosity of the active nucleus .",
    "however , if the nucleus is affected by differential extinction the luminosity derived for the nuclear starburst could be higher by up to a factoor of 4 . yet",
    ", the main problem of fitting the observed sed in circinus at high energies with the softer emission expected from the nuclear starburst remains unsolved .    finally , it is interesting to note that veilleux & bland - hawthorn ( 1997 ) estimated that the filamentary ejecta , extending radially from the nucleus of circinus , were probably expelled by an explosive nuclear event that occurred a few myr ago .",
    "such a time scale fits with the age of the nuclear burst estimated in this section .",
    "we have studied the nuclear region of the circinus galaxy by means of near ir images which have an angular resolution @xmath151 (= 3 pc as projected on the source ) , and k  band integral field spectroscopy with an angular resolution @xmath152 and spectral resolution of 1000 and 2000 .",
    "the k  band image reveals a nuclear non  stellar source that is unresolved , i.e. whose size is smaller than 1.5 pc in radius . such nuclear non ",
    "stellar light is most likely emitted by dust heated by the seyfert nucleus .",
    "when compared to models of the ir emission from obscuring torii , our upper limit fits the expected size of the k  band emission in sy2s .",
    "the coronal line region traced by the [ sivi ] line extends for @xmath153 50 pc into the narrow line region , but the higher excitation [ alix ] emission line is much more compact .",
    "the variation of the [ alix]/[sivi ] ratio in the light cone might indicate that the ionization parameter of the nlr clouds decreases radially due to photoionization of high density clouds in the galactic plane .",
    "the nuclear emission from the h@xmath10 lines observed in the k - band extends in the same direction as the [ sivi ] emission .",
    "the h@xmath10 line ratios indicate that such lines are emitted by thermally excited gas , probably heated by the same x  ray radiation that excites [ sivi ] . at lower surface brightness levels",
    "the h@xmath10 emission extends along the plane of the galaxy : in these regions uv  fluorescence might contribute to the excitation mechanism .",
    "the stellar velocity field traced by the stellar features in the k  band does not show evidence for a point  like mass concentration in the nuclear region . also , there are no hints of an increase in the mass  to  light ratio toward the nucleus .",
    "we set an upper limit of @xmath154 for the mass of a putative black hole . as a consequence",
    ", the l@xmath72/l@xmath75 ratio must be larger than 0.1 .",
    "the br@xmath32 map indicates evidence for ongoing star forming activity within a few tens of pc from the active nucleus .",
    "the mass  to  light ratio , from the 100 pc scale to the innermost 10 pc , is quite low and indicates that the stellar population is relatively young , with an age ranging between @xmath3 and @xmath117 .",
    "there are indications of an outward propagation of the starburst .",
    "the bolometric luminosity derived for the young stellar population inside the central 400 pc is comparable to the ( intrinsic ) luminosity of the active nucleus , and both of them together contribute most of the bolometric luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "the stellar population within r @xmath155 pc has an age of @xmath5 yrs and contributes only 2% of the intrinsic luminosity of the active nucleus .",
    "we have discussed models that ascribe agn fuelling to mass loss from a young nuclear star cluster in the light of our observational constraints .",
    "our results fit predictions of these models in terms of expected nuclear stellar luminosity relative to the agn luminosity .",
    "we have also considered the case of a nuclear starburst contributing significantly to the br@xmath32 emission in the narrow line region ( terlevich s hypothesis ) . in this case",
    "the nuclear ( @xmath6 10 pc ) stellar population could be as young as @xmath142 , but the implied bolometric luminosity of the nuclear star cluster would be only 20% of the intrinsic luminosity of the active nucleus .",
    "however , differential extinction effects could lead to an underestimate of the luminosity of the nuclear star cluster by up to a factor of 4 .",
