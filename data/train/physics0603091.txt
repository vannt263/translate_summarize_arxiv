    "in the theory of relativity , the 4-vector force acting on a particle is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity of the particle , because the magnitude of the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 keeps constant@xcite as @xmath1 any force acting on the particle can never change @xmath0 in the magnitude but change @xmath0 in the direction , thus the 4-vector force is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity .",
    "strictly , the proofing of the orthogonality is given by @xmath2 the orthogonality does not depend upon any property of 4 vector force , holds for any kinds of forces . where the frame of reference is a cartesian coordinate system whose axes are orthogonal to one another , there is no distinction between covariant and contravariant components , only subscripts need to be used , @xmath3 denotes the mass of the particle , the 4 dimensional space time refers to @xmath4 , the index @xmath5 takes over @xmath6    we found that the electromagnetic force of the maxwell s theory can not completely satisfy this orthogonality , this incompletion leads us to find that the electromagnetic force has two independent components in the 4 dimensional space time .",
    "a 4-vector force has 4 components , because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity , the number of independent components of the force reduces to 3 , while the electromagnetic force can merely provide 2 independent components , this situation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the electromagnetic force  does this missing undefined component is a hidden variable ?  quantum mechanics is eager to find it for a long time .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper is to strictly proof that the electromagnetic force has two independent components in the 4 dimensional space time .",
    "we also briefly discuss the possibility that the undefined component of the electromagnetic force serves as a hidden variable for quantum mechanics .",
    "suppose there are two charged particle @xmath7 and @xmath8 locating at the positions @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath11 , and moving at the 4-vector velocities @xmath0 and @xmath12respectively , as shown in fig.1 , where we have used @xmath13 to denote @xmath14 .",
    "the coulomb s force @xmath15 acting on the particle @xmath7 is orthogonal to the velocity direction of @xmath7 , as illustrated in fig.1 by using the euclidian geometry to represent the complex space - time , like a centripetal force , the force @xmath15 would likely make an attempt to rotate itself about the particle s path center , we think that the path center , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the force @xmath15 all should be in the plane of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , so that we make an expansion to @xmath15 as     is orthogonal to the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 of @xmath7 , and lies in the plane of @xmath12 and @xmath13 with a retardation with respect to @xmath16 , here the euclidian geometry is used to illustrate the complex space - time . ]",
    "@xmath17    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are unknown coefficients , @xmath20 and @xmath13 are chosen as two independent basis vectors , we will discuss the completion of the expansion in the subsection 4 , but for the moment , the expansion would be used to clarify a relationship between the orthogonality and the electromagnetism .    using the orthogonality @xmath21",
    ", we get @xmath22by eliminating the coefficient @xmath19 , we rewrite eq.([3 ] ) as @xmath23   \\label{5}\\]]it follows from the direction of eq.([5 ] ) that the unit vector @xmath24 of the coulomb s force is given by @xmath25 \\label{6}\\]]because of@xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 as illustrated in fig.1 .",

    "it is easy to find that eq.([15 ] ) contains the lorentz force .      from eq.([13 ] ) , because of @xmath36 , i.e. @xmath37 , we have @xmath38it is known as the lorentz gauge condition . to note that",
    "@xmath39 has three degrees of freedom under the condition @xmath28 , so we have @xmath40from eq.([14 ] ) , we have @xmath41where we define @xmath42 as the current density of the source . from eq.([14 ] ) , by exchanging the indices and taking the summation of them , we have @xmath43the eq.([19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) are known as the maxwell s equations .",
    "for continuous media , they are valid as well as .      from the maxwell s equations , we know that there is a retardation time for the electromagnetic action to propagate between the two particles , as illustrated in fig.1 , the retardation effect is measured by @xmath44 wherer @xmath45 is the unit vecotr of @xmath12.then @xmath46 obviously , eq.([22 ] ) is known as the lienard - wiechert potential for a moving particle .",
    "the above formalism clearly shows that the maxwell s equations can be derived from the classical coulomb s force and the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity . in other words ,",
    "the orthogonality is hidden in the maxwell s equation .",
    "specially , eq.([5 ] ) directly accounts for the geometrical meanings of the curl of vector potential , the curl contains the orthogonality .",
    "the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity is one of consequences from the relativistic mechanics@xcite .",
    "but , whether the expansion we have used in eq.([3 ] ) is complete ?",
    "obviously , we choose two basis vector @xmath12 and @xmath13 to construct the electromagnetism successfully , this choice means that the electromagnetic force has two independent components in its hilbert space based on the two basis vector @xmath12 and @xmath13 , we readily recognize that the expansion is incomplete .",
    "a 4-vector force has 4 components , because of the orthogonality of 4-vecor force and 4-vector velocity , the number of independent components of the force reduces to 3 , thus a complete expansion of a 4-vector force needs 3 basis vectors .",
    "our argument also arises from that if the electromagnetic force of the maxwell s theory has two independent components , then there is an undefined component accompanying the maxwell s electromagnetic force .",
    "this missing undefined component may serve a hidden variable for quantum mechanics . in the next sections , we will strictly and comprehensively proof that the electromagnetic force of the maxwell s theory does have two independent components , does have an undefined component in the physics . in order to clarify its aspects as much as possible ,",
    "we present four methods to proof the theme .",
    "in usual 3d space , the vector product of two vector @xmath47 and @xmath48 is defined as another vector @xmath49 given by @xmath50 , or @xmath51 , where the indexes i , j and k take over @xmath52 in the 3d space , @xmath53 defined in usual textbooks ; as we know , the vector @xmath49 is orthogonal to both the vectors @xmath47 and @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the minkowski s space",
    ", we also intruduce a definition for vector product : as shown in fig.1 , imaging that there is a 4-vector @xmath57 which is orthogonal to the plain of @xmath20 and @xmath13 , then @xmath57 is defined by the vector product as @xmath58where the indexes take 1,2,3,4 .",
    "it is easy to obtain their orthogonalities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , because @xmath61the vector @xmath57 can be easily imaged out intuitively in fig.1 .",
    "the electromagnetic 4-vector force has 4 components , it subjects to the first constraint given by @xmath62the second constraint on the 4-vector force is given by @xmath63the first constraint is just the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity , the second constraint reflects our choice that the electromagnetic force lies in the plain of @xmath20 and @xmath13 to which the vector @xmath57 is orthogonal . subjecting to these two constraints",
    ", the number of independent components of the electromagnetic force reduces to 2 .",
    "the two independent components allow the electromagnetic force to change in the plain of @xmath20 and @xmath13 .",
    "the moving particle @xmath8 exerts an electromagnetic force @xmath15 on another moving particle @xmath7 , the action has been sophisticatedly expressed as @xmath64 to note that in the present stage of human s knowledge , the above each term can not be resolved into more details , therefore , we conclude that the electromagnetic force contains two terms , each term represents a basis vector of its hilbert space , the number of independent components of the electromagnetic force is 2 .",
    "this provides an insight into electromagnetism that a full electromagnetic force should contain at least tree terms in its formalism .",
    "the nucleus of a hydrogen atom provides a spherical coulomb s electric potential for its outer electron , this 4-vector force subjects to the first and second constraints , given by @xmath65the second constraint expresses that the torque of the centripetal force is zero , and it arises from the above mentioned @xmath66 for this instance . because , refering to fig.1 , @xmath67 permits the expansion of @xmath68 , whereas the nucleus is at rest , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , then @xmath71 i.e. , @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "inversely , if @xmath72 , then we can construct a vector @xmath57 so that @xmath74 .",
    "you can see , if we consider the two constraints , then the 4-force in hydrogen atom has only two independent components .    in bohr",
    "s hydrogen atom , the electron of hydrogen moves in a circular orbit , the attractive force subjects to the spheric symmetry as its third constraint , in that case , the number of independent components of the 4-vector force reduces to 1 , in consistency with its circular motion .",
    "a 4-vector force has 4 components , because of the orthogonality of 4-vector force and 4-vector velocity , the number of independent components reduces to 3 , while the electromagnetic force can merely provide 2 independent components , this situation means that there is an undefined component accompanying the electromagnetic force .",
    "what is the effect of the electromagnetism - undefined - component ( euc ) in the physics ? outside the electromagnetism , a variety of problems may concern with the euc , for example , quantum mechanics is eager to find a hidden variable for a long time for which the euc may serve . since its complex , we put the fourth proof in the next section , where we choose and briefly discuss three basic questions : ( 1 ) the properties of the euc ; ( 2 ) wave function and 4-vector velocity field in the euc ensemble space ; ( 3 ) a successful application to hydrogen s fine structure .",
    "the properties of the euc include : ( 1 ) euc is a small quantity which is hardly noted by physicists , if it serves as a hidden variable for quantum mechanics , then it should be responsible to the planck s constant ; ( 2 ) euc is a fluctuating quantity in the ensemble space of enormous identical experiments , its average value at a given point must be zero , like @xmath75 ; ( 3)as a nature of independency , euc must be independent from our electromagnetic field , for example , in a vacuum when any our electromagnetic field has vanished off its mater environment , while the euc can still alive in the vacuum and cause the indeterminacy of the motion of particles moving in the vacuum ; ( 4)euc also correlates with our electromagnetic field through the orthogonality @xmath76 ; ( 5 ) the effect of euc on physics must be comprehensive , it is not concern with individual cases , no body can really escape from its fluctuation if the euc still remains at undefined status .",
    "according to the above mentioned properties of euc , the proof outside the electromagnetism will carry out on `` the path '' that leads us from the euc to the two key points of quantum mechanics : wave function and hydrogen atom .",
    "consider a particle diffraction experiment in an electromagnetic field where the euc is active and cause the indeterminacy of quantum mechanics , each particle in the field subjects to both the electromagnetic force @xmath15 and euc @xmath77 , then it satisfies the dynamic equation : @xmath78 in order to eliminate the euc term by means of statistics , i.e. using @xmath75 , we turn to study this dynamic equation in the ensemble space which consists of enormous particle paths recorded in enormous identical experiments , in the ensemble space we find @xmath79strictly speaking , eq.([35 ] ) is not derived from eq.([33 ] ) , it stands for the property that the magnitude of any 4-vector velocity keeps constant , otherwise this velocity concept collapses . if we regard the enormous recorded particle paths in the ensemble space as a flow , it is easy to find that there a 4-vector velocity field for the flow .",
    "we clearly emphasize two points:(1 ) at every point of the ensemble space , the mean 4-vector velocity satisfies the above mean dynamic equation ; ( 2 ) the mean 4-velocity is a 4-vector velocity field of the flow , @xmath80 is a function of the position of the ensemble space , i.e. in the form of @xmath81 .    for our convenience",
    ", we drop the mean sign @xmath82 for the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 in the followings , simply use @xmath0 in palce of @xmath80 .",
    "as mentioned above , the 4-vector velocity @xmath0 can be regarded as a 4-vector velocity field in the ensemble space , then @xmath83beware : eq.([1a ] ) is the most important step in the present work after inducing the concept of 4-vector velocity field in ensemble space . substituting them back into the dynamic equation , and re - arranging these terms , we obtain @xmath84using the notation @xmath85eq.([1c ] )",
    "is given by @xmath86because @xmath87 contains the variables @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , they are independent from @xmath92 , then a solution satisfying eq.([1f ] ) is actually of    @xmath93    the above equation allows us to introduce a potential function @xmath94 in mathematics , further set @xmath95 , we obtain a very important equation @xmath96where @xmath97 may be a complex mathematical function , its physical meanings will be determined from experiments after the introduction of the planck s constant @xmath98 , as we have know , it is wave function .    substituting eq.([2a ] ) into @xmath99 , we obtain a wave equation @xmath100it is a new quantum wave equation@xcite . where the left side corresponds to the product of momentum and momentum itself , does not correspond to the product of momentum operator and momentum operator .    in this subsection , by using the @xmath101 concept and 4-vector velocity field in ensemble space ,",
    "we construct a relation between wave function and particle momentum , as we know , the relation has been widely used in quantum mechanics .      in the following ,",
    "we use the gaussian units , and use @xmath102 to denote the rest mass of electron . in a spherical polar coordinate system @xmath103 , the nucleus of a hydrogen atom provides a spherically symmetric potential @xmath104 for the electron motion . the wave equation ( [ 3a ] ) for the hydrogen atom in the energy eigenstate @xmath105 may be written in the spherical coordinates : @xmath106by substituting @xmath107 , we separate the above equation into @xmath108x^{2 } & = & 0   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{6a } \\\\ ( \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial r})^{2}+[\\frac{1}{\\hbar ^{2}c^{2}}(e+\\frac{e^{2}% } { r})^{2}-\\frac{m_{e}^{2}c^{2}}{\\hbar ^{2}}-\\frac{\\lambda } { r^{2}}]r^{2 } & = & 0 \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\label{7a}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are constants introduced for the separation .",

    "because the restriction @xmath130 in eq.([16a ] ) , we find @xmath131 .    the result , eq.([16a ] )",
    ", is completely the same as the calculation of the dirac wave equation for the hydrogen atom@xcite , it is just the * fine structure of hydrogen atom energy*.    after we introduce the euc into quantum mechanics , the quantum mechanics becomes reasonable at its key points , we think that we have indirectly proofed the existence of the euc outside the electromagnetism , and the electromagnetic force of the maxwell s theory has two independent components in the 4 dimensional space - time .",
