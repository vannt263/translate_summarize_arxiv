    "orbital ordering is one of the unusual and attractive phenomena in solid state physics .",
    "specific occupation of orbitals plays a major role in electronic properties of numerous transition metal compounds .",
    "orbital ordering is generally accompanied by the jahn - teller effect , a structural distortion that lifts the orbital degeneracy.@xcite the jahn - teller distortion mainly affects the local environment of the transition metal cation , while the crystallographic unit cell is only slightly changed or even unchanged at all .",
    "the latter issue leads to certain difficulties in the structure analysis , since the distortion causes minor alterations of the diffraction patterns",
    ". nevertheless , modern experimental techniques of high - resolution neutron and synchrotron x - ray diffraction are usually able to resolve weak structural changes associated with the orbital ordering ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "divalent copper is probably the most known transition metal cation subjected to the jahn - teller effect . in a regular octahedral environment , the electronic configuration @xmath3 of cu@xmath4",
    "leads to the orbital degeneracy that is usually lifted by an extremely strong tetragonal distortion .",
    "this distortion reduces the coordination number of copper and yields cuo@xmath2 plaquettes typical for the structures of cu@xmath4-containing oxides.@xcite high - symmetry structures ( e.g. , perovskite structure ) may constrain the jahn - teller distortion from the plaquettes formation .",
    "nevertheless , a notable tetragonal distortion takes place , the orbital ordering is established , and peculiar electronic properties emerge .",
    "thus , perovskite - type copper fluorides kcuf@xmath5 and k@xmath0cuf@xmath2 are known as first examples of the cooperative jahn - teller distortion , giving rise to ferromagnetic ( fm ) interactions induced by the specific orbital ordering.@xcite    despite the large magnitude in the jahn - teller distortion in copper compounds , the identification of the distortion pattern may be quite problematic .",
    "this is the case for layered copper oxyhalides ( cux)lam@xmath0o@xmath1 with x = cl , br and m = nb , ta .",
    "these compounds have composite structures built by [ lam@xmath0o@xmath1 ] perovskite - type blocks and [ cux ] rocksalt - type layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_structure]).@xcite in the following , we will focus on one of these compounds , ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 , that recently drew attention due to its unusual and puzzling magnetic properties.@xcite    initially , the crystal structure of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 was refined in the tetragonal space group @xmath7 with the cl atom located in the special @xmath8 position @xmath9.@xcite in this structure ( further referred as regular ) , copper has a squeezed octahedral coordination with two short cu  o bonds [ @xmath10(cu  o ) = 1.97 a ] and four long cu  cl bonds [ @xmath10(cu  cl ) = 2.74 a ] , see fig .",
    "[ fig_structure ] .",

    "et al_.@xcite proposed a new structural model with the cl atoms randomly occupying one quarter of @xmath14 sites @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "this model yields two short ( about 2.4 a ) and two long ( about 3.15  a ) distances consistent with the crystal chemistry of copper oxychlorides.@xcite caruntu _ et al_.@xcite tentatively ascribed the distortion to the jahn - teller effect of cu@xmath4 .",

    "the regular structure of the [ cucl ] layer gives rise to the frustrated square lattice spin model with the competing nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor couplings @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "]    the structure of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 was further studied by means of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) measurements.@xcite the spectra evidenced the lack of the tetragonal symmetry and revealed single sites of cu , cl , and la atoms , hence suggesting the ordering of the cl atoms , at least on the local scale . additionally , yoshida _",
    "et al_.@xcite performed electron diffraction studies and found superstructure reflections that unambiguously confirmed the ordering of the cl atoms and the resulting cooperative distortion of the copper polyhedra .",
    "however , the specific ordering pattern remains unclear . to refine the superstructure",
    ", one has to use the superstructure reflections that are absent in x - ray and neutron diffraction patterns.@xcite the respective reflections are revealed by electron diffraction , but their intensities are strongly affected by multiple scattering and hence unsuitable for the refinement.@xcite    the magnetic properties of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 are unusual and lack a clear microscopic interpretation .",
    "the studies reveal a spin gap behavior and a singlet ground state that are incompatible with the frustrated square lattice ( @xmath19 ) model , as proposed by the regular crystal structure in fig .",
    "[ fig_structure].@xcite inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) data are even more puzzling and suggest long - range interactions ( between cu atoms separated for about 9  a ) to be relevant for ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite such an unusual magnetic behavior could be caused by a non - trivial orbital state of copper and intricate superexchange pathways , emerging due to a specific cooperative distortion .",
    "thus , unraveling this distortion is a key to understand the magnetic properties of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 .    presently , there are two reports that consider possible ordering patterns of the cl atoms and attempt to relate these patterns to the exchange interactions in ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "whangbo and dai@xcite used extended hckel calculations to study qualitatively exchange couplings in several ordered structures .",
    "they proposed a model of ring clusters with a number of inequivalent cu and cl sites that is in contradiction to the nmr and nqr results.@xcite yoshida _",
    "et  al_.@xcite employed an even more empirical approach and searched for an ordering pattern with `` explicit ''  copper dimers ( i.e. , two cu atoms connected by the double bridge of short cu  cl bonds ) .",
    "such dimers can probably account for the spin - gap behavior , but they are unable to explain the long - range interactions , as proposed by the ins data .",
    "neither of the two studies considered the underlying reasons for the structural distortion or proposed numerical estimates of the exchange couplings .",
    "the physics of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 is quite complex and includes both structural ( cooperative distortion ) and magnetic ( exchange interactions ) aspects . unfortunately , experimental techniques up to now fail to determine the superstructure , hence complicating the analysis of the exchange couplings .",
    "the latter is non - trivial itself due to the presence of long - range interactions . in this work ,",
    "we attack the problem by using full - potential band structure calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , since computational methods are known as an effective tool for solving complex problems in solid state physics .",
    "the main advantage of the computational approach is the possibility to estimate numerically the relevant parameters such as the total energy and the exchange couplings .",
    "the evaluation of the total energy is crucial for resolving the structural problems in case conventional diffraction techniques experience difficulties in a precise structure determination .",
    "for example , the local density approximation ( lda ) level of dft was successfully applied for studying the structures of lithium monoboride,@xcite while proper treatment of correlation effects allowed to derive jahn - teller distortion and to explain the resulting fm interactions in transition - metal fluorides kcuf@xmath5 ( refs .   and  ) and cs@xmath0agf@xmath2 ( ref .  ) .",
    "quite recently , band structure calculations predicted ferroelectric distortions in unconventional manganite multiferroics@xcite followed by the experimental confirmation.@xcite    the outline of the paper is as follows .",

    "[ tetragonal ] , we present the computational results for the regular structure of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",

    "[ discussion ] , we compare our results to the experimental findings , discuss the resulting spin model , and demonstrate that our scenario provides consistent interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "we also give an outlook for further experimental studies and conclude the section with a short summary .",
    "scalar - relativistic band structure calculations were performed using a full - potential local - orbital scheme ( fplo , versions 7.00 - 27 and 8.50 - 32)@xcite and the exchange - correlation potential by perdew and wang.@xcite lda calculations were done for the smallest possible unit cells employing the actual symmetry of the atomic positions , i.e. , a 12-atom tetragonal unit cell for the regular structure ( @xmath20 , space group @xmath7 ) and a 24-atom orthorhombic unit cell for the distorted structure ( @xmath21 , space group @xmath22 ) . for the local spin density approximation ( lsda)+@xmath23 calculations with different types of spin ordering , a number of monoclinic 48- and 72-atom supercells were used ( space groups @xmath24 or @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the monoclinic axis , see sec .

    "distorted ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_scells ] for details ) .",
    "the structure optimization was carried out in the 48-atom @xmath27 supercell , as suggested by the electron diffraction data.@xcite the triclinic ( @xmath28 ) symmetry of this supercell allowed for free relaxation of all 48 atoms .",
    "different unit cells employed different @xmath29 meshes with at least 72 , 192 , 730 , and 2925 @xmath29 points in the irreducible part of the first brillouin zone for the 72- , 48- , 24- , and 12-atom cells , respectively . the convergence with respect to the @xmath29 mesh",
    "was carefully checked .",
    "two sets of structural information are available for ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 . in ref .",
    ", the structure was refined from the x - ray data , while in ref .",
    "the neutron data were used .",
    "the latter results are claimed to be more accurate , because neutrons are more sensitive to the positions of light atoms.@xcite additionally , the interatomic distances yield more reasonable formal valences , as calculated with the empirical bond valence sum rules.@xcite yet , the authors of ref .",
    "note that the resulting cu ",
    "o distance ( 1.84 a ) is unusually short as compared to other copper oxides and oxychlorides.@xcite keeping in mind this ambiguity , we performed calculations for both sets of the atomic coordinates . the results for the stabilization energies and the exchange couplings are similar within @xmath30% , which is likely comparable to the actual accuracy of our calculations .",
    "this outcome is quite natural , because the difference between the two structures deals with the atomic positions along the @xmath26 axis ( the positions in the @xmath31 plane are fixed by the symmetry ) , whereas the main physics takes place in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "note , however , that the structure refined from the neutron data has lower energy , though both structures are not fully relaxed and reveal sizable forces ( @xmath32 ev / a.u . ) along the @xmath26 axis for nb and o atoms .",
    "the forces on the respective atoms have opposite signs , hence the relaxed atomic positions lie between those suggested by x - rays and neutrons .",
    "the general computational procedure for both regular and distorted structures is as follows .",
    "we start with lda calculations , focus on the states close to the fermi level and construct an effective model for these states .",
    "the model yields the estimates for all the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) couplings in the systems under investigation , hence facilitating the choice of relevant interactions .",
    "we also calculate wannier functions in order to get a direct , graphical representation of the relevant orbitals .",
    "the wannier functions are computed in a maximally localized fashion@xcite using the internal procedure of fplo8.50 .",
    "then we proceed to lsda+@xmath23 calculations and get independent estimates of the leading exchange couplings .",
    "additionally , we use lsda+@xmath23 for the structure optimization , because lda is known to conceal jahn - teller distortions in transition metal compounds due to improper treatment of the correlation effects.@xcite    in the lda band structure , the states close to the fermi level are relevant for the possible orbital degeneracy and for the magnetic interactions .",
    "the respective bands are analyzed within a tight - binding ( tb ) model , and the resulting hoppings ( @xmath33 ) are introduced to an extended hubbard model with the effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath34 . for both regular and distorted structures , the strongly correlated limit @xmath35 is realized , hence the hubbard model can be reduced to the heisenberg model for the low - lying excitations under the assumption of the half - filling .",
    "the afm contributions to the exchange integrals are estimated as @xmath36 , and all the possible superexchange pathways are analyzed .",
    "the latter feature is especially important , since long - range interactions are expected in ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite the precise value of the @xmath34 parameter for copper oxyhalides is unknown , although a recent study of cucl@xmath0 and cucl@xmath37h@xmath0o suggests @xmath38  ev.@xcite in the present work , we employ the representative value @xmath39 ev , as commonly used for copper oxides ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "note that the values of @xmath40 merely scale with @xmath34 , and the ratios of @xmath40 , which are the relevant quantity for the ground state , are not affected by the ambiguity of the choice of @xmath34 .",
    "the lda results can be effectively used to construct models on top of dft .",
    "however , it is also helpful to account for the correlation effects in the course of the self - consistent calculations .",
    "this opportunity is provided by the lsda+@xmath23 method that treats the correlation effects in the mean - field approximation .",
    "lsda+@xmath23 is known to yield reasonable estimates of different quantities [ energy gaps , electric field gradients ( efgs ) , and exchange integrals ] in strongly correlated electronic systems and , in particular , to treat correctly the cooperative jahn - teller distortions.@xcite the problematic point of the lsda+@xmath23 approach deals with the choice of the @xmath41 and @xmath42 values that account for the on - site coulomb repulsion and exchange , respectively .",
    "the optimal values of these parameters are known to depend on the particular computational method and on the objective quantities as well as on the specific chemical and structural features of the compound under investigation.@xcite unfortunately , there are no established lsda+@xmath23 parameters for copper oxychlorides , although the recent application of @xmath43  ev to cucl@xmath0 and cucl@xmath37h@xmath0o can be used as a reference.@xcite in our calculations , we employ several representative and physically reasonable values of @xmath41 over a wide range , namely , 3.5 , 5.5 , and 7.5 ev.@xcite below , we will show that all these values lead to qualitatively similar behavior , although the details of the microscopic scenario depend on the @xmath41 value used .",
    "the exchange parameter @xmath42 is fixed at 1  ev , since it is known to have minor influence on the results .",
    "one should keep in mind that the lsda+@xmath23 coulomb repulsion parameter @xmath41 is usually _ different _ from the effective on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath34 , as employed in the model analysis above .",
    "the latter potential corresponds to the antibonding @xmath44 lda bands with the contributions from cu , cl , and o orbitals ( see fig .  [ fig_dost ] ) , while @xmath41 is applied to the cu @xmath45 orbitals _ only_. in the framework of the one - band hubbard model , the antiferromagnetic superexchange couplings should scale as @xmath46 , but this scaling is not necessarily applicable to the lsda+@xmath23 results for the total exchange and to their dependence on @xmath41 .",

    "such a gap is still insufficient to account for the green color of the compound .",
    "however , one should be aware that the straightforward mapping of either the lda or the lsda+@xmath23 single - particle spectrum onto the optical properties may be misleading .",
    "many - body effects are sometimes crucial for proper evaluation of the excitation energies , as recently shown for lithium niobate , linbo@xmath5.@xcite we believe that the optical properties of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 require a careful study on the many - body level of theory , and such a study lies beyond the scope of the present work . in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the discussion of ground - state properties ( optimized crystal structure ) and low - lying excitations ( magnetic interactions ) .",
    "both problems deal solely with the valence bands , while the conduction bands lie @xmath52  ev higher in energy hence bearing little influence on the objectives of our work .",
    "the orbital resolved dos shows that the bands near the fermi level are mainly formed by cu @xmath49 orbital with a contribution from the @xmath50 orbital ( see the inset of fig .",

    "the same picture emerges from the band structure plot .",
    "there are two distinct copper bands above @xmath53 ev , and these bands are formed by the @xmath49 and @xmath50 orbitals ( fig .  [ fig_bandt ] ) .",

    "band structure calculations yield numerical estimates for individual exchange couplings , and it is instructive to compare these estimates with the experimental data .    in the previous section , we have emphasized that the calculated @xmath136 values have the same order of magnitude as the relevant experimental numbers , the curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath137 ) and the saturation field ( @xmath138 ) . to make a numerical comparison",

    "our calculations do not show any sizable fm interactions and yield @xmath137 of @xmath146 k , well above the experimental value of 9.6  k.@xcite thus , the fm interactions are underestimated . yet",
    "the afm interactions seem to be overestimated , because the leading afm interaction @xmath147  k is above the saturation field of 30  t ( i.e. , 40  k).@xcite however , the @xmath136 values strongly depend on the position of the cl atoms , and one may expect a better agreement in case the experimental position is considered . indeed , at @xmath16 the leading coupling @xmath107 is reduced to 30  k ( see table  [ tab_hoppings ] ) , i.e. , below the value of the saturation field .    basically , one has to find out the precise position of the cl atoms in order to give accurate estimates of the exchange couplings in ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , our spin model derived for the optimized position ( @xmath106 ) is qualitatively valid and suggests the plausible mechanism of the magnetic frustration in this material .",

    "the strong frustration naturally explains the lack of the long - range ordering in ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 despite sizable couplings along both @xmath149 , and @xmath26 axes being present .",
    "the explanation of the spin gap behavior is more complicated , because the spin model presented in fig .",

    "normally , two - dimensional spin systems without the dimerization are gapless .",
    "however , the magnetic frustration can strongly modify the physics and lead to a sizable spin gap as found in , e.g. , cav@xmath2o@xmath151.@xcite we believe that a detailed theoretical treatment of the realistic spin model with at least three interactions ( @xmath148 , and @xmath112 ) is necessary to elucidate the origin of the spin gap in ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 . meanwhile , we should note the `` unconventional '' origin of the spin gap .",
    "the gap is not caused by dimerization ; therefore , the gap does not simply separate singlet and triplet states of a dimer .",
    "rather , it separates a singlet ground state and a complex excited state of a two - dimensional frustrated spin system .",

    "[ distorted ] , there is an additional distortion in the [ lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 ] block , which for now remains unresolved computationally .",

    "the calculations propose the energetically favorable structural model shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_distortion ] .",
    "this structure is thermodynamically stable as well , in case the entropy contribution is negligible ( this is usually the case in ordered solids at sufficiently low temperatures , e.g. , at room temperature ) . nevertheless , the compound itself is metastable and readily decomposes at 450  @xmath152c .",
    "the preparation temperature is quite low ( 325  @xmath152c ) ; therefore , the real system does not necessarily reach the equilibrium state proposed by the calculations .",
    "although we expect that the real structure resembles the thermodynamically stable one , the difference between the calculated ( equilibrium ) and real ( non - equilibrium ) structures along with the uncertainty of the cl atom position are the most likely reasons for the discrepancies between the experimental and computational results .    unfortunately , there is no way to optimize the structure of non - equilibrium systems .",
    "therefore , our spin model and our estimates for the exchange couplings should be considered as approximations to the properties of the real material . to get further insight",

    "first of all , careful electron microscopy investigations are able to provide supplementary information on the structure of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "these studies should challenge the proposed structural model and investigate the local structure , since a number of defects ( e.g. , twinning ) are expected .",

    ", the ins data are analyzed within a simple dimer model .",
    "further analysis within the realistic spin model ( fig .",
    "[ fig_interactions ] ) will be very helpful .    finally , we suggest that the scenario of the structural distortion may be generic for the whole family of layered perovskite - type copper compounds [ ( cux)lam@xmath0o@xmath1 , ( cux)m@xmath153m@xmath5o@xmath154 , etc . with x = cl , br ; m = nb , ta ; and m@xmath155 = ca , sr ] .",
    "all these materials present an interesting but presently poorly understood physics .",
    "for example , ( cubr)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 reveals columnar afm ordering at the unexpectedly high temperature of 32  k ( despite the exchange couplings are also of the order of @xmath156  k),@xcite while some of the ( cubr)m@xmath153m@xmath5o@xmath154 compounds show a magnetization plateau at 1/3 of the saturation.@xcite the common feature of this compound family is the high - symmetry environment of copper and the tendency of the x atom to be shifted away from the high - symmetry position , as evidenced by high debye - waller factors in crystal structure refinements.@xcite we propose that all the compounds should in fact show a structural distortion of jahn - teller type .",

    "the first indication for the relevance of this scenario is found in the recent nmr study of ( cubr)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite it is shown that the bromine compound lacks the tetragonal symmetry similar to ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 . this may suggest a distortion pattern similar to that in the chlorine compound ( fig .",
