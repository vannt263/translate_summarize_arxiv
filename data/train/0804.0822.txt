    "starless cores are dense regions ( @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xmath1 ) in dark clouds with linear scales of tenths of pc , and total masses of a few solar masses .",
    "the starless cores contain no infrared sources above the sensitivity level of the iras satellite ( about 0.1 l@xmath4 at the distance of taurus ) and thus are thought to be sites of possible future rather than current star formation @xcite .",
    "detailed observations of individual starless cores @xcite show density profiles that approximately match those of pressure - confined , hydrostatic spheres ( bonnor - ebert or be spheres ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite an overall similarity in structure , recent observations with increasingly better angular resolution and sensitivity show that the starless cores are not all the same .",
    "for example , observations of l1517b indicate isothermal gas and show spectral line profiles indicative of little motion or possibly expansion @xcite . in contrast , observations of l1544 indicate a significant variation in temperature from center to edge @xcite and show spectral line profiles consistent with an overall contraction @xcite .",
    "the cores b68 and tmc-1 provide another example in contrast .",
    "observations of co in b68 indicate an excitation temperature rising toward the edge of the core @xcite , and show spectral line profiles consistent with internal oscillations ( sound waves ) @xcite . in comparison , observations of co isotopologues in tmc-1c @xcite",
    "indicate an excitation temperature decreasing toward the edge and show spectral line profiles consistent with contraction .    in an earlier paper",
    "@xcite we suggested that the observed differences were consistent with the different temperature and density structures of starless cores that have central densities greater or less than about @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the significance of this particular density is twofold .",
    "first , this density divides the starless cores into those that are dynamically stable ( those with lower densities ) and those that must be contracting or collapsing ( those with higher densities ) .",
    "the dynamical stability , of course , also depends on the total mass and the internal energy of the core , but for starless cores with masses of 1 - 10 m@xmath4 , temperatures of around 10 k , and subsonic internal velocities , the critical density for dynamical stability falls within a range around @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "second , at densities below a few 10@xmath5 @xmath1 the molecular gas in starless cores cools primarily through molecular line radiation , but at higher densities the gas cools primarily through collisional coupling with the dust .",
    "this difference in cooling results in different temperature structures in cores with central densities below or above @xmath0 @xmath1 . if the density in a core is everywhere below @xmath0",
    "@xmath1 so that the gas and dust are nowhere collisionally coupled , then the entire core cools primarily by molecular line radiation . as a result ,",
    "the core is approximately isothermal .",
    "if the core has a central density above @xmath0 @xmath1 , the gas in the core center cools by collisional coupling with the dust whereas the gas elsewhere cools by molecular line radiation .",
    "this difference in cooling results in a variation in temperature across the core . because the dust , heated by external starlight , is cooler in the core center , the gas there , coupled to the dust , is also cooler .",
    "in this paper we continue our investigation of the structures of the two classes of starless cores .",
    "we improve our previous model of thermal equilibrium by accounting for the heating of the gas by hot electrons photoelectrically released from dust grains and by including variable molecular abundances based on a simple model for co chemistry .",
    "our improved model for starless cores allows a better interpretation of the observational data .",
    "for example , the inclusion of photoelectric heating provides a better description of the thermal structure near the core boundary where this effect is most significant .",
    "applied to recent observations of the edges of the starless cores b68 and tmc-1c @xcite the rising and falling co excitation temperature seen in the observations of the two cores , respectively , are consistent with the different effect of photoelectric heating on cores with relatively higher and lower densities at their boundaries .",
    "the loss from the gas phase of co and other molecular coolants has only a minor effect on the gas temperature and hence the density structure of starless cores @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , an understanding of the molecular abundances is quite important in the interpretation of spectral line observations , particularly the line profiles and strengths .",
    "we have used our simple model of co chemistry in modelling spectral line profiles in an oscillating lower mass , lower density starless core @xcite and in modelling spectral line strengths in a collapsing , higher mass , higher density , starless core ( e.  keto & p.  caselli , in prep . ) .",
    "our improved models of starless cores are also useful in constraining some of the properties of the interstellar medium ( ism ) that relate to the thermal equilibrium of the starless cores . in particular , we obtain temperatures closer to those indicated by observations with dust opacities higher than those of naked grains and more consistent with fluffy dust @xcite , and cosmic - ray ionization rate towards the lower end of the range of estimates , @xmath6 s@xmath7 to @xmath8 s@xmath7 . we find that photoelectric heating improves the stability of cores by increasing the confining pressure with reduced overlying mass , but additional internal energy is still required if the larger cores are to be supported .",
    "the higher mass and higher density cores are unstable to collapse and the formation of protostars within a free - fall time , but being starless , these cores have not yet formed a protostar . thus these cores may be thought of as `` young brides '' that are soon to give birth to stars .",
    "the density profiles within these cores are more centrally concentrated owing to the greater importance of gravitational forces in confining the core .",
    "these cores often show asymmetric spectral line profiles @xcite consistent with inward motions and line widths that increase toward the centers of the cores consistent with inward acceleration of the infall .",
    "spectral lines from some cores show two components separated by more than the sound speed indicating supersonic velocities @xcite .",
    "these denser cores are not isothermal .",
    "observations of both dust @xcite and gas @xcite indicate cooler temperatures in their centers , the latter consistent with the change from molecular line cooling to more efficient dust cooling as the density increases toward the interior .    in contrast , lower mass and lower density cores are stable against gravitational contraction , and therefore in the absence of changes in their environment , will remain starless .",
    "these barren cores may be thought of as `` old maids '' .",
    "these cores have flatter density profiles consistent with the relatively greater importance of an external pressure in confining the cores .",
    "their spectral line profiles may be simple gaussians indicating little internal motion or show complex shapes consistent with internal oscillations ( sound waves ) @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength infrared observations also indicate internal density perturbations @xcite .",
    "the linewidths are generally more constant across the core and indicate subsonic internal velocities .",
    "these cores are more nearly isothermal ( @xmath9 k ) consistent with molecular line cooling throughout .",
    "some recent papers have also drawn attention to differences within the population of starless cores and use terms such as `` pre - stellar '' to indicate a tendency toward collapse and star formation versus `` starless '' or `` failed '' to suggest the opposite @xcite . sometimes the distinction is drawn as `` gravitationally bound '' and `` gravitationally unbound '' suggesting a ratio of greater or less than unity of gravitational energy to internal energy including thermal energy and possibly microturbulence and magnetic energy .",
    "these terms suggest a division of the starless cores into two classes distinguished by their gravitational stability and future evolution . @xcite",
    "divide the starless cores into two categories called `` bright '' and `` intermediate '' .",
    "these refer to the brightness of the dust emission which is related to the mass and density of the cores . in this paper",
    "we suggest that the distinction is motivated by other observational properties as well , and that the various properties of the two classes may be derived from a single theoretical model for the starless cores that we describe in the following several sections .",
    "we refer to the two classes of cores as `` thermally super - critical '' and `` thermally sub - critical '' .",
    "we choose these terms to emphasize that the distinction is based on the physics of the cores rather then their origin or evolution .",
    "the term `` thermal '' in this description is appropriate because it refers to both their thermal - radiative equilibrium and also to their thermally - supported dynamical equilibrium . whether the cores are supported primarily by thermal energy or by magnetic energy",
    "is still a matter of debate .",
    "the evidence is gathering on the side of thermal support with non - thermal energy being an important but minor contributor to their stability @xcite .",
    "in other words , without any non - thermal energy most of the cores would be unstable . however , to achieve stability , the cores require only an amount of non - thermal energy that is a fraction of their thermal energy .",
    "the terms thermally super and sub - critical are similar in meaning to the terms magnetically super and sub - critical that are well established in the literature , but the `` thermal '' modifier suggests that thermal energy is here more important than magnetic energy .",
    "it is not necessary to prove this supposition to adopt the terminology , and in any case , in this study we model the cores as thermally supported .    as typical parameters for our calculations , we adopt a central density of @xmath3 @xmath1 and a total mass of 10 m@xmath4 to represent a thermally super - critical core , and @xmath0 @xmath1 and m@xmath4 for a thermally sub - critical core .",
    "the well - studied cores l1544 and b68 are estimated to have similar central densities .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath10 @xmath1 for l1544 and @xcite and @xcite estimate @xmath11 @xmath1 and @xmath12 @xmath1 respectively for b68 , all three estimates based on fitting isothermal be spheres to the observational data . while l1544 and b68 are prototypes of cores in the two classes , here we are not attempting to model these two cores exactly .",
    "our example parameters are chosen as round numbers that provide a factor of ten difference in density and mass , sufficient to bring out the differences in their structures .",
    "of course , the real cores have combinations of mass and density that form a continuum that includes these two examples .",
    "other parameters for the cores are listed in table 1 .",
    "molecular abundances in starless cores are the result of complex interactions involving gas - phase chemistry , freeze - out and desorption , and photodissociation . in order to develop a simplified model we assume that the abundance of co is decreased by two effects : 1 ) freeze - out onto dust grains in the high density center , and 2 ) photodissociation at the edge of the core .",
    "@xcite suggest that at the edge of a molecular cloud where photodissociation is important , the dominant cycle for the formation and destruction of co is , # 1 @xmath13 the time scale for the formation of ch@xmath14 by radiative association is longer than for the formation of co from ch@xmath14 and o. therefore we assume that the rate of formation of co is given by that of ch@xmath14 .",
    "this eliminates consideration of the complex chemistry of oxygen .",
    "the co cycle may then be described by three rate equations for the creation and destruction of c@xmath15 , c , and co , for example , @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the rates for the destruction and creation of c@xmath15 .",
    "similar equations hold for c and co. the conservation equation in the form , @xmath19 indicates that the symbols stand for the non - dimensional relative abundance of the three species with respect to the total abundance of carbon . assuming steady state we may solve for the relative abundance of co as , @xmath20 the ratios of the relative abundances , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are equal to the ratios of the rates of destruction and creation of the respective species in the numerators . using the data in @xcite , these ratios are , @xmath23 and @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the number density of hydrogen , @xmath26 is the interstellar radiation field in units of the habing flux ( habing 1968 ) , @xmath27 is the mean visual extinction to the interstellar radiation field , and the numerical values of the coefficients are taken from tables 5 and 12 of @xcite .",
    "the mean extinction at each point in the cloud is computed as the extinction from the point to the cloud surface averaged over all directions , @xmath28 the habing flux @xmath29 corresponds to the average interstellar radiation field of the galaxy .",
    "figure [ fig : co_abundance ] shows the variation of the three species , co , c , and c@xmath15 as a function of @xmath27 for a cloud with a constant density of 1000 @xmath1 and @xmath29 . for this flux level , the simple model provides for exponential replacement of co and c@xmath15 at an @xmath27 of about 1",
    ". the more complex photodissociation model of @xcite shows that this exponential replacement is the dominant relationship , although in their figure 9b the replacement occurs at a higher @xmath27 of @xmath30 because of the higher radiative flux in their model , @xmath31 .      by comparing dust and molecular line emission ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were able to measure variations in the gas - phase abundance of several molecules in several cold , dark clouds .",
    "the observations suggest that the molecular abundance in dense gas is an equilibrium between the rate of depletion from the gas phase as molecules freeze onto dust grains and the rate of the inverse process of desorption @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the steady state abundance of co in dense gas may be computed as the ratio of the depletion time to the sum of the depletion and desorption times .",
    "the time scale for depletion onto dust may be estimated as @xcite , @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the sticking coefficient , with @xmath34 meaning that the molecule sticks to the dust in each collision ; @xmath35 is the ratio of the number density of dust grains relative to molecular hydrogen ; @xmath36 is the mean cross - section of the dust grains ; and @xmath37 is the relative velocity between the grains and the gas .",
    "if the grains have a power law distribution of sizes with the number of grains of each size scaling as the -3.5 power of their radii @xcite , then we can estimate their mean cross - section as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the minimum and maximum grain sizes .",
    "if @xmath41 @xmath42 m and @xmath43 @xmath42 m , then @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , the ratio of the number densities of dust and gas may be estimated by computing the mean mass of a dust grain and assuming the standard gas to dust mass ratio of 100 . if the density of the dust is 2 grams @xmath1 , then the ratio of number densities is @xmath46 .",
    "the relative velocity due to thermal motion is , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the temperature and @xmath42 the molecular weight .",
    "there are several processes that generate heat on dust grains that can liberate frozen molecules to the gas phase .",
    "these include exothermic h@xmath14 formation on the grains , cosmic ray collisions with dust grains , and photo - desorption of molecules off the grains @xcite .",
    "the uv radiation for this latter process derives from the ionization of the molecular gas by cosmic rays . according to @xcite , in starless cores",
    "these processes are all independent of density .",
    "the rate of h@xmath14 formation is independent of the molecular density because the density of hi in starless cores is independent of the molecular density .",
    "the rates of all these desorption processes are not well defined , nor is it known which is dominant .",
    "therefore , for definiteness we adopt the rate given by @xcite for desorption by cosmic rays but with the understanding that other processes might also be important .",
    "the time scale is , @xmath49 where the cosmic - ray ionization rate @xmath50 s@xmath7 , and the binding energy of co onto ice is @xmath51 k @xcite .",
    "we choose this value for the binding energy because it is between the binding energies of co on water ice , 1180  k @xcite , and on co ice , 850  k @xcite , assuming a typical solid h@xmath14o / co abundance ratio of @xmath5230 on ice mantles in dense clouds @xcite .",
    "the relative abundance of co in the gas phase in equilbrium between depletion and desorption is , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , and the symbols stand for the non - dimensional relative abundance of co in the two phases with respect to the total co abundance .",
    "the depletion time scales inversely with the collision rate while the desorption time scales inversely with the cosmic - ray ionization rate .",
    "therefore the depletion of co is dependent only on the gas density because the cosmic - ray ionization rate is assumed to be the same throughout the cloud .",
    "figure [ fig : depletion ] shows the dependence of the steady state abundance of co versus the molecular gas density .",
    "while we only illustrate the steady state abundance of co in this paper , the model for depletion and desorption may also be used to describe the time dependent evolution of co between the gas and grain phases .",
    "the change with time of the abundance in the gas phase is , @xmath55      the combined effects of photodissociation and depletion result in the abundance of co peaking inside the boundary of the core where the visual extinction is just high enough to shield the co , but the density has not yet become high enough for significant depletion by freeze - out .",
    "this effect is seen in figures [ fig : l1544_abundance ] and [ fig : cloud_abundance ] .",
    "figure [ fig : l1544_abundance ] shows a spherically - symmetric , static - equilibrium model with the properties of a thermally super - critical core .",
    "this core is the same as shown in figure 5 of @xcite but with a factor of 2 higher total mass .",
    "figure [ fig : cloud_abundance ] shows a stable , starless core perturbed by an internal oscillation .",
    "this particular structure of an oscillating core , motivated by observations of b68 , is the same as illustrated in figures 6 and 7 of @xcite and is included here to show how the abundance varies in response to an asymmetric density profile .",
    "the sharp drop in density at the boundary of this thermally sub - critical core is due to the high internal density at the boundary where the core is truncated to give it a low mass . in b68",
    ", this transition implies a high pressure exterior confining gas , probably hot gas .",
    "models for the temperature structure of dark clouds have been described in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "these models include the effects of molecular line cooling , the radiative equilibrium of dust in starlight , dust - gas collisional coupling , and cosmic ray heating .",
    "we start with the model described in @xcite that includes these effects , and improve this model by including variations in the cooling rate due to abundance variations and by including photoelectric heating at the cloud boundary .      in a model for molecular line cooling that uses cooling coefficients based on a local approximation such as the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) radiative transfer model @xcite , it is straightforward to include the effect of abundance variations due to depletion . to do this , we use the cooling coefficients for different `` depletion factors '' , for example as listed in the tables in @xcite .",
    "we assume that the abundance of coolants is given by our simple model of the co abundance .",
    "this follows because most of the molecular line cooling is through transitions of carbon species such as @xmath56co , @xmath57co , c@xmath58o , c , and cs @xcite .    at the cloud edge where the co abundance varies due to dissociation",
    "we must also include the cooling due to c@xmath15 which can be as effective a coolant in photodissociation regions as co is in molecular regions .",
    "the c@xmath15 cooling rate is given by ( @xcite , eqn 27 ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the ionization fraction , taken to be the abundance relative to h of c@xmath15 , or @xmath61 c@xmath15/c@xmath62 .",
    "figures [ fig : temperaturel1544 ] and [ fig : temperatureb68 ] show the effect of abundance variations on our two classes of cores . while a decrease in abundance results in a decrease in the cooling rate , the temperatures of the depleted and undepleted cores are about the same . in the thermally super - critical cores ,",
    "the cooling at the core center is dominated by collisional coupling to the dust and the cooling at the outer radii is dominated by c@xmath15 . only at mid - radii",

    ", abundance variations also do not change the temperature too much , but for a different reason .",
    "the optical depths of the coolants in the thermally sub - critical cores are low enough that the gas can always find some transitions with moderate optical depths for effective cooling despite the changes in abundance caused by depletion .",

    ", high energy photons can liberate electrons from dust grains by the photoelectric effect . in cold dark clouds ,",
    "the heating rate is @xcite , @xmath63 where the efficiency factor @xmath64 for the conditions in cold dark clouds .",
    "the factor @xmath65 is the number of high energy photons ( @xmath66 ev ) normalized by the number in the general interstellar radiation field . in computing @xmath67 , the intensity",

    "figures [ fig : photoelectricl1544 ] and [ fig : photoelectricb68 ] show the temperature structures of our two classes of cores with photoelectric heating .",
    "where the gas is thin enough that shielding is ineffective , photoelectric heating raises the temperature .",
    "figures [ fig : photoelectricl1544 ] and [ fig : photoelectricb68 ] also compare the gas temperature with the excitation temperature of co computed by our non - lte radiative transfer code @xcite assuming a total co abundance relative to h@xmath14 of @xmath74 @xcite . in the thermally super - critical cores ,",
    "the gas density is very low at the boundary ( figure [ fig : twodensities ] ) , and the co is not strongly excited by collisions .",
    "thus the excitation temperature of co declines with radius despite the increase in the gas temperature .",
    "this is consistent with observations of the diffuse interstellar medium that show h spin temperatures of about 75 k and co temperatures below 5 k @xcite .",
    "in contrast , because of the high density throughout the sub - critical cores ( figure [ fig : twodensities ] ) , the co is always collisionally excited and the co excitation temperature is everywhere approximately the same as the gas temperature .",
    "the co excitation temperature slightly exceeds the local gas temperature at locations where the gas temperature is rising rapidly and the co line has a non - neglible optical depth .",
    "this is because the line radiation from the nearby warmer gas heats the local co level populations .",
    "@xcite also calculate the brightness and ratios of some co lines in models of starless cores .",
    "observationally , the excitation temperature of co in cores may be determined by comparing the brightness of the ( 2 - 1 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) transitions .",
    "figures [ fig : c18oratios ] and [ fig : c13oratios ] show that the ratio of co(2 - 1 ) to co(1 - 0 ) declines at the edge of the thermally super - critical cores as the excitation temperature decreases whereas in the thermally sub - critical cores , the ratio rises at the edge .",
    "this predicted decrease in the co excitation temperature has been observed at the edge of tmc-1c ( figure 12 of * ? ? ? * ) , a core whose properties put it in the thermally super - critical class .",
    "in contrast , at the edge of the sub - critical core b68 , the ratio of the co lines is observed to be constant or possibly slightly rising ( figure 5 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although the decreasing line strengths adversely affect the signal - to - noise just at the edge where the comparison is the most diagnostic , the observed ratios are consistent with the different behavior of the line ratios expected in each of the two classes of cores .",
    "recent observations show promise of measuring the gas temperature with a precision of a few degrees . such precision might allow a determination of the rate of cosmic - ray ionization and also the opacity of the dust . in dark clouds and dense cores , observations of molecular ions as well as measurements of kinetic temperature limit the possible values of the cosmic - ray ionization rate to between about @xmath7510@xmath76 and @xmath7710@xmath76 s@xmath7 @xcite . in our models",

    ". however , higher sensitivity ammonia observations at core radii of 0.05 to 0.1 pc are needed to make a definitive statement . in the thermally sub - critical cores , because the temperature is nearly uniform except at the edge , and because the gas and dust are not well coupled , the higher cosmic ray rates simply raise the gas temperature across the cores .",
    "the gas temperature is also dependent on the dust opacity . from a comparison of co and dust observations",
    ", @xcite found that the opacity of dust in dark clouds is higher than in the more diffuse interstellar medium . in the cold quiescent interiors of dark clouds ,",
    "interstellar dust grains acquire thick icy mantles that increase their opacity . in the high density centers of thermally super - critical cores ,",
    "the ice - coated dust may coagulate and become fluffy , further increasing the opacity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "further evidence for higher dust opacities is provided by observations by evans et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that show that a standard dust opacity results in core masses that are beyond the gravitational stability limit if the cores were modeled as bonnor - ebert spheres .",
    "if the dust opacity were higher than the standard opacities in the interstellar medium , then the core masses would be less , and the cores more stable with lifetimes longer than free - fall times and more consistent with the numbers of cores observed .",
    "keto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) determined the core masses independently of the dust opacity from observations of n@xmath14h@xmath15 lines and also found indications that the dust mass opacity appropriate for the more diffuse interstellar medium is too low for cloud cores .",
    "precise measurements of the gas temperature in starless cores could provide yet another line of evidence for or against fluffy dust .",
    "figures [ fig : crratesl1544 ] and [ fig : crratesb68 ] compare the gas temperatures in our two classes of cores calculated with the standard dust opacities of @xcite and with the opacities increased by a factor of four . the increased opacities reduce the gas temperature everywhere . in the center of the cores ,",
    "the gas temperature is reduced because the radiative input to the dust is decreased . at the outer radii",
    ", the increased dust opacity provides shielding against the high energy photons responsible for the photoelectric heating .",
    "although there are complicating factors , the temperatures determined from molecular line observations are generally more consistent with the lower gas temperatures predicted by the increased dust mass opacities of fluffy dust .",
    "this is particularly noticeable in the center of the thermally super - critical cores where the observed temperature , about 6 k , ( figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is below that obtainable with standard dust opacities even with the `` low '' rate of cosmic ray heating .",
    "another way to raise the dust optical depth without changing the dust opacity is to raise the gas density . if the density of the core were higher , the dust optical depth would also be higher , even for the same mass , and the central temperatures therefore lower .",

    "a higher central density of course implies a higher density throughout the core , and this would not be consistent with continuum and molecular line observations of l1544 .",
    "although our models assume a dust opacity that is independent of density , the opacity in starless cores may be higher at densities above @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite . in order to put stringent constraints on the cosmic - ray ionization rate , accurate measurements of the gas temperature as well as the dust continuum emission at various wavelengths",
    "will be needed to determine the temperature and dust opacity as a function of radius and density .",
    "the starless cores are generally successfully modeled as bonnor - ebert spheres with the addition of some non - thermal energy amounting to a fraction of the total internal energy @xcite .",
    "any disagreements with observations seem resolvable by the addition of further physical processes to the models .",
    "as suggested in our study here , some of these details are significant such as non - isothermal gas , variable molecular abundances , and perturbations in velocity and density , but so far no observations or theoretical considerations have suggested a revision of the basic model that the cores are pressure - supported , self - gravitating clouds .",
    "however , the bonnor - ebert spheres as theoretical objects have requirements that are not necessarily met by the starless cores . as truncated solutions of the lane - emden equation ,",
    "the be spheres require an exterior bounding pressure . if the bounding medium is cold enough that its own self - gravity is significant , then the combination of the be sphere and the confining medium can not be dynamically stable .",
    "however , if the external medium is hot enough that self - gravitational forces are negligible , then the bounding medium itself will not collapse onto the sphere and decrease its stability .",
    "this seems to be the case for isolated cores such as b68 .",
    "what about cores that exist in the midst of a star forming region filled with widespread , low - density , molecular gas ? is the increase in temperature of the molecular gas caused by photoelectric heating sufficient to stabilize the surrounding molecular gas ?    to investigate this possibility we calculate the maximum stable central densities for cores of different masses with and without photoelectric heating .",
    "this calculation assumes the stability criterion of be spheres @xcite applied to non - isothermal cores . as a function of mass",
    "we compute the maximum or critically stable central density which occurs at the maximum stable external pressure as indicated by a diagram such as figure 1 of @xcite or figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : stability ] shows that photoelectric heating improves the stability of larger cores .",
