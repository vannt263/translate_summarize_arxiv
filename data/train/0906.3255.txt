    "uniqueness follows from lemma [ densityfour ] since these spaces are reduced ( the omission of the finitely many classical weights with @xmath529 does not affect the density of the classical points ) .",
    "in this section we determine the nature of the image and fibers of the map @xmath442 . for each @xmath33 , the map @xmath530 is and isomorphism , and it follows easily from lemma [ eigenpoints ] and the definition ( [ shimuraonalgebras ] ) that the restriction @xmath531 is injective .",

    "the map @xmath540 is clearly surjective from its definition ( [ shimuraonalgebras ] ) .",
    "thus the image of @xmath442 is locally cut out by a coherent ideal ( since the rings @xmath202 are noetherian ) , and is therefore an analytic set in @xmath541 .",
    "since these spaces are reduced , @xmath442 is an isomorphism of @xmath532 onto this analytic set . both @xmath532 and @xmath541 are equidimensional of dimension one by lemma 5.8 of @xcite , so corollary 2.2.7 of @xcite ensures that the image of @xmath442 is a union of irreducible components .",
    "note that for each @xmath33 , there are exactly two connected components of @xmath25 that map via @xmath353 to @xmath520 , namely @xmath37 and @xmath542 where @xmath543 .",

    "the existence of such an isomorphism stems from the existence of a hecke operator @xmath235 on families of overconvergent forms that is a kind of `` square - root '' of the operator @xmath239 .",
    "in @xcite we constructed operators @xmath13 ( on the spaces considered in that paper ) having the effect @xmath546 on @xmath128-expansions , for all primes @xmath6 dividing the level .",
    "these operators were found to commute with all other hecke operators , but only commute with the diamond operators up to a factor of the quadratic character @xmath547 . in our case , if @xmath548 , then such a map would in fact alter the _ weight _ since the @xmath16-part of the nebentypus is part of the @xmath16-adic weight character .",
    "note that we have a factorization @xmath549 let @xmath265 denote the involution of @xmath25 given by @xmath550    [ up ] fix a primitive @xmath551 root of unity @xmath552 .",
    "let @xmath148 be a connected admissible affinoid open and let @xmath49\\cap { \\mathbb{q}}$ ] .",
    "there is a compact @xmath149-linear map @xmath553 having the effect @xmath554 on @xmath128-expansions at @xmath555 .",
    "this map commutes with the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 for all @xmath6 and satisfies @xmath556    the construction of @xmath235 , like the all of the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 follows the general procedure set up in section 5 of @xcite .",
    "we will omit the details as they would take up considerable space and are very similar to the constructions of the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and content ourselves with commenting that the nontrivial commutation relation with the diamond operators arises ( as it does in the construction of @xmath13 given in @xcite ) because the `` twisting '' function @xmath557 on @xmath558 used in the construction is not fixed by the diamond operators as it is in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    extending scalars to @xmath559 and replacing @xmath153 by @xmath560 we arrive at a map in the opposite direction @xmath561 that has the same effect on @xmath128-expansions .",
    "it follows that the composition of these maps in either order is @xmath239 ( or its scalar extension ) .",
    "everything we have said about @xmath235 thus far holds equally well for cusps forms , and lemmas 2.12 and 2.13 of @xcite now imply that @xmath562 since @xmath265 is an isomorphism we get a diagram @xmath563^{\\sim}\\ar[d ] &    \\widetilde{z}_{\\epsilon(x)}\\ar[d ] \\\\",
    "x\\ar[r]^{\\epsilon } &    \\epsilon(x)}\\ ] ] in which the horizontal arrows square to the identity map in the evident fashion . note that this diagram establishes a bijection between the covers @xmath564 and @xmath565 .",
    "using the links , we see that it is also compatible with enlarging @xmath153 and hence one obtains an involution of the whole space @xmath249 covering the involution @xmath265 .",
    "let @xmath566 with connected image @xmath567 and note that the corresponding element @xmath568 has connected image @xmath569 .",
    "corresponding to @xmath179 and @xmath570 we obtain decompositions @xmath571 and @xmath572 respectively .",
    "note that by extending scalars to @xmath203 , @xmath235 induces a map @xmath573      let @xmath575 $ ] be the polynomial factor of @xmath576 associated to the choice of @xmath179 , so that @xmath577 $ ] is the polynomial associated to @xmath578 .",
    "thus the summand @xmath579 of @xmath580 is precisely the kernel of @xmath581 and since the map @xmath235 commutes with the action of @xmath239 , this summand maps to the kernel of @xmath582 in @xmath583 under @xmath235 .",
    "the latter is simply @xmath463 , so @xmath235 at least restricts to some map @xmath584    as above we can extend scalars to @xmath585 and reverse the roles of @xmath186 and @xmath586 to get a map in the other direction with the property that both compositions are simply @xmath239 ( or a scalar extension thereof ) on the respective spaces .",
    "that these maps are isomorphisms now follows from the fact that @xmath239 is invertible on the modules @xmath463 and @xmath587 .",
    "it follows from lemma [ uponn ] and the commutation relations in proposition [ up ] that the map @xmath588 given by @xmath589 on coefficients and @xmath590 on the generators is in fact well - defined .",
    "thus we obtain a map @xmath591 covering the map @xmath592 .",
    "this construction readily glues over @xmath593 .",
    "moreover , the maps @xmath594 are compatible with the canonical links used in the construction of @xmath19 ( because these links are simply induced by restriction to smaller admissible opens in @xmath108 ) , and it follows that these maps glue to a map @xmath595 . when this map is composed with the one obtained by reversing the roles of @xmath33 and @xmath596 ( in either direction ) , one obtains the identity , as is evident from the definition ( [ defofinv ] ) . in particular it is an isomorphism and extends to an involution of the whole space @xmath19 . finally , that the diagram ( [ upandsh ] ) commutes can be checked on points since these spaces are reduced .",
    "but then it follows immediately from the characterization of these points in terms of systems of eigenvalues in lemma [ eigenpoints ] and the definition ( [ defofinv ] )    the restriction @xmath116 in theorem [ classicallift ] is there to avoid certain theta functions that show up in weights @xmath597 and @xmath598 .",
    "there is no meaningful modular lifting of the theta series of weight @xmath597 ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "however , one _ can _ lift cuspidal theta functions of weight @xmath598 , but one obtains eisenstein series of weight @xmath599 instead of cusp forms .",
    "let @xmath600 be a primitive dirichlet character modulo a positive integer @xmath97 such that @xmath601 .",
    "then @xmath602 is a classical cusp form of weight @xmath598 , level @xmath603 and nebentypus character @xmath604 .",
    "the form @xmath605 is an eigenform for all @xmath4 ( @xmath606 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath607 with eigenvalues @xmath608 .",
    "the shimura lift of this form is the eisenstein series @xmath609 of weight @xmath599 , where @xmath610 , as it easy to check from the explicit formulas in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 be an odd prime .",
    "if @xmath611 , then @xmath605 is in the kernel of @xmath239 and does not furnish a point on the eigencurve @xmath19 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath612 , then @xmath605 thought of in level @xmath613 is in fact a @xmath239 eigenform with eigenvalue @xmath614 .",
    "thus @xmath605 furnishes a point on @xmath19 and the existence of the map @xmath442 implies that there exists a _",
    "_ @xmath16-adic eigenform with the same eigenvalues .",
    "it is easy to check that the form @xmath615 has the expected eigenvalues , so this must be the image form .",
    "in fact it is easy to check using the explicit formulas in @xcite that this is in fact the classical shimura lift applied to @xmath605 thought of at level @xmath613 .",
    "thus we a lead to the conclusion that @xmath616 , while not a classical cusp form , is a cuspidal @xmath16-adic modular form .",
    "that is , @xmath616 vanishes at the cusps in the connected component @xmath617 of the ordinary locus .",
    "this fact also follows from theorem 3.4 of @xcite , where cipra computes the value of @xmath616 at every cusp .",
    "we also remark that this is only possible since @xmath618 is of critical slope ( in this case , slope @xmath40 ) since if it were of low slope then the technique of kassaei @xcite implies that a low - slope form that is @xmath16-adically cuspidal is in fact a classical cuspidal modular form ."
