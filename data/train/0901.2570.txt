    "the acoustic peaks imprinted on the temperature power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) have now been measured with impressive precision by a number of experiments @xcite .",
    "these observations place tight constraints on the values of many of the fundamental cosmological parameters . with the fifth year of integration from the wmap satellite",
    "there is seemingly little room left for any deviation from the basic @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "however , degeneracies exist between some parameters which can not be broken by cmb data alone ( e.g. @xcite .",
    "perhaps the two most important examples are the curvature of the universe and the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure of the dark energy and @xmath11 is its density .",
    "meaningful constraints can not be obtained on these parameters using cmb data in isolation .",
    "the full potential of the cmb measurements is realized when these data are combined with other observations , such as the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae and the large scale structure of the universe as traced by galaxies @xcite .",
    "these complementary data sets come from the late universe compared with the cmb data , and the interpretation of the observations is more complicated and controversial .",
    "type ia supernovae ( sne ) have been proposed as standard candles which can probe the luminosity distance - redshift relation . the first strong evidence in support of a cosmological constant came from combining the sne data with cmb measurements @xcite .",
    "the type ia hubble diagram has come under intense scrutiny to uncover any hint of non - standardness arising from the nature of the host galaxy , possible evolution with redshift or variation in dust extinction @xcite .",
    "a recent joint analysis of sne from different datasets suggests that the systematic error on the equation of state parameter from a joint cmb and sne analysis is comparable to the size of the random error @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of galaxy clustering has also been used in combination with cmb data ( e.g. percival et  al .",
    "according to the standard lore , the galaxy power spectrum on large scales is expected to have a simple relation to the underlying dark matter spectrum .",
    "moreover , the shape of the spectrum is believed to closely follow that expected in linear perturbation theory for the matter , which can be readily computed given a set of values for the cosmological parameters . however , with the availability of improving measurements and more refined modelling of the galaxy power spectrum it has become clear that this simple picture is no longer sufficiently accurate to describe the data .",
    "additional levels of modelling of the deviations from linear theory have to be incorporated into the analysis .",
    "these include empirical models of the nonlinear distortion of the power spectrum @xcite and possible scale dependent biases between the clustering of galaxies and mass @xcite .",
    "recent studies have cast doubt on the accuracy of these prescriptions @xcite . in principle , if the simple models described the form of the observed power spectrum , then the power spectra measured from different galaxy samples should yield equivalent constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "however , @xcite found a fundamental difference in the shapes of the galaxy power spectra measured from the two - degree galaxy redshift survey and the sloan digital sky survey , after attempting to correct the measured spectra .",
    "these authors found that the red selection of the sdss galaxies results in a strong scale dependent bias ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "similar scale dependent effects have been seen in the power spectrum of dark matter haloes and galaxies modelled in simulations @xcite .",
    "recent analyses have not attempted to model the overall shape or amplitude of the power spectrum , as a consequence of the difficulties described above in interpreting the results from different samples . instead , attention has shifted to a pattern of oscillatory features called the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , which are imprinted on the matter power spectrum .",
    "these features have been advocated as a standard ruler which can be used to measure the distance - redshift relation , and hence constrain the dark energy equation of state @xcite .",
    "the bao arise from oscillations in the baryon - photon fluid prior to matter - radiation decoupling .",
    "this phenomenon gives rise to the peaks seen in the power spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cmb . in the matter power spectrum ,",
    "the oscillations have a much smaller amplitude as baryons only account for around 20 per cent of the total matter density of the universe .",
    "furthermore , the oscillations in the matter spectrum are out of phase with those in the cmb @xcite .",
    "the oscillation scale is related to the size of the sound horizon at recombination , which can be measured with high accuracy from the cmb @xcite .",
    "the apparent size of the bao ruler depends upon the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 , as these determine the angular diameter distance out to a given redshift . in practice ,",
    "the bao are not precisely a standard ruler at the level of precision demanded for their interpretation in future surveys .",
    "nevertheless , by modelling the appearance of the bao accurately , they are still a valuable probe of cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "careful simulation work and modelling has shown that techniques can be developed which can overcome long - wavelength gradients in the power spectrum to yield robust constraints on the bao using the galaxy power spectrum @xcite .",
    "the bao signal has been detected in both the 2dfgrs and sdss surveys @xcite .",
    "the most powerful bao measurements currently come from samples of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite .",
    "detections at a lower significance have also been reported using galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the imprint of these features has even been found in the three point function of lrgs @xcite . despite this rapid progress ,",
    "the conclusions drawn from measurements of the bao remain unclear .",
    "for example , @xcite analysed the bao signal in a joint galaxy sample drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release five ( dr5 ) and the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) . ignoring the information from the amplitude and long - wavelength shape of the power spectrum , and simply isolating the bao , the results of percival et  al",
    ". showed a 2.4@xmath14 discrepancy with the distance measurements inferred from the supernovae type ia ( sn ) data by @xcite , signaling a possible problem in the modelling of the bao data , or a challenge to the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "much theoretical work has been devoted to uncovering scale dependent effects in the bao and in improving the modelling of the signal in galaxy surveys @xcite . in order to realize the full potential of the bao technique as a cosmological probe it is essential to quantify any systematics in the signal and to understand how the measurements relate to cosmological parameters .",
    "first , let us debunk some possible preconceptions about bao .",
    "as we have remarked above , the bao are not precisely a standard ruler . in the correlation function ,",
    "the fourier transform of the power spectrum , the bao appear as a broad peak at large pair separations @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that even in linear perturbation theory , the maximum of the bao peak in correlation function does not coincide with the sound horizon scale at the percent level of accuracy required to fully exploit the measurements expected from forthcoming galaxy surveys .",
    "furthermore , @xcite and @xcite have shown that both large volume numerical simulations and theoretical predictions based on renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ) indicate that the bao peak in the correlation function is shifted and distorted in a non - trivial manner relative to the prediction of linear perturbation theory .",
    "if unaccounted for , these shifts bias the constraints obtained by using the bao measurements as a standard ruler .",
    "careful modelling of the correlation function is therefore required to extract the cosmological information encoded in large scale structure .",
    "@xcite argued that the correlation function is less affected by scale dependent effects than the power spectrum and that a simple model for the correlation function proposed by @xcite , based on rpt @xcite , gives an essentially unbiased measurement of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "this means that information from the large scale shape of the correlation function , in addition to the form of the bao peak , can be used to provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "the correlation function therefore provides a better constraint on the distance scale than the more conservative , `` bao only '' approach required when using the power spectrum ( i.e. which requires the long wavelength shape information to be discarded along with the amplitude ) .    in this paper",
    "we apply this new model to the shape of the redshift space correlation function , @xmath15 , of the sdss data release 6 ( dr6 ) lrgs measured by @xcite .",
    "the lrg sample analysed by @xcite is twice the size of the sample used to make the first detection of the bao by @xcite , and has also yielded the first measurement of the radial bao signal , which constrains the hubble parameter @xcite .",
    "we combine the lrg clustering information with the latest measurements of cmb and sne data .",
    "we focus on the constraints on the dark energy equation of state and the curvature of the universe , which are the parameters where the extra information from the shape of @xmath15 can dramatically improve upon the cmb only constraints .",
    "we also pay special attention to the consistency of the results obtained with different dataset combinations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we describe the data used in our parameter estimation . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we describe the details of our modelling of the shape of the redshift space correlation function and compare it with measurements in n - body simulations .",
    "we also set out the different parameter spaces that we study and describe our methodology for parameter estimation . in section",
    "[ sec : test ] we assess the impact of the details of the parameter estimation technique on the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents our main results for the parameter constraints obtained by comparing theoretical models to the cmb data and the correlation function of the sdss - dr6 . in section  [ sec : distances ] we focus on the constraints on certain distance combinations obtained from the shape of @xmath15 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix a gives the theoretical motivation for the model we use to describe the correlation function and appendix b gives the covariance matrix for the distance constraints .",
    "here we describe the different datasets that we use to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the modelling of the correlation function of luminous red galaxies is described later on in section  [ ssec : rpt ] .",
    "the datasets described below are used in different combinations to check the consistency of the constraints returned .",
    "luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) are an efficient tracer of the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "these galaxies are selected by color and magnitude cuts designed to identify intrinsically red , bright galaxies using sdss photometry ( see eisenstein et al 2001 for a complete description of the color cuts ) .",
    "lrgs can be seen out to higher redshifts than galaxies in a simple magnitude limited catalogue , and so map a larger volume of the universe .",
    "lrgs have a low space density compared to @xmath16 galaxies , which means that fewer redshifts have to be measured to map out the same volume . the low space density , which translates into a higher shot noise , is compensated for by the stronger than average clustering of lrgs , which maintains the signal - to - noise of the correlation function at a level which can be measured .",
    "here we use the measurement of the 2-point correlation function of lrgs in redshift space made by @xcite shown by the black points in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] .",
    "these authors studied the clustering of lrgs in data release 6 ( dr6 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which has 75000 lrg galaxies spanning a volume of @xmath17 over the redshift interval @xmath18 . the comparison between dr6 and the result of @xcite",
    "is plotted in fig.b4 of @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] ; the two results are in good agreement with the dr6 result showing an improvement of a factor of about @xmath19 in the size of the errors .",
    "@xcite carried out an extensive series of tests of their measurement of the lrg correlation function .",
    "they found that systematic uncertainties in the estimation of the radial selection have a small impact on the results ( ie see their figure b2 ) .",
    "the adoption of different weighting schemes also produces negligibly small changes ( their fig.b5 and b11 ) .",
    "these careful tests indicate that this new estimation of the correlation function is robust and that any possible systematic effects are small compared to the error bars .    here",
    "we recap two aspects of the analysis of @xcite which are particularly relevant to this paper : the treatment of the survey mask and the estimation of the covariance matrix of the correlation function .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the angular and radial selection of a galaxy catalogue , including the redshift completeness as a function of magnitude and position on the sky , is an essential prerequisite for a measurement of clustering .",
    "this information allows the mean density of galaxies in the survey to be estimated . after the release of dr6",
    ", @xcite provided this information in a readily usable form , translating the original mask files extracted from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog @xcite , from mangle into healpix format @xcite .",
    "@xcite describe how they constructed a survey  mask \" for lrgs and tested the impact of the mask on clustering measurements using mock catalogues .",
    "using the same techniques , we have also examined the correlation function of lrgs in dr7 , which has become available since the submission of @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] , we plot a summary of the possible systematics in the estimation of the correlation function .",
    "the estimates corresponding to different versions of the survey mask and different ways of generating a catalogue of random points are in remarkably good agreement with one another .",
    "furthermore , the results from dr6 and dr7 are in excellent agreement ; dr7 represents only a modest improvement over dr6 .",
    "the results of @xcite are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfunc ] using triangles .",
    "their estimate is consistent with that of @xcite within the errors ( note that their binning is different , and also , perhaps , their normalisation , due to a small shift which could be attributed to systematics ( see section  [ sec : kshift ] ) ) . whilst there is a modest improvement in the parameter constraints on using the dr7 measurement , in line with the incremental change in the number of lrgs and the solid angle covered , we have decided to retain the dr6 measurement in this paper , because the survey mask has been tested more extensively in that case .",
    "the dr6 measurement represents a factor of @xmath20 more volume than that covered by the lrg sample analyzed by eisenstein et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "@xcite constructed a covariance matrix for the lrg correlation function using mock catalogues drawn from the marenostrum institut de ciencias del espacio ( mice ) n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "the extremely large volume of this run ( box size @xmath21 ) allowed 216 essentially independent lrg dr6 mocks to be extracted .",
    "@xcite investigated different methods to estimate the error on the correlation function ( see their appendix a ) .",
    "they found that the jackknife error , an internal estimate made from the dataset itself ( jk ; see norberg et  al .",
    "2008 ) , gave a reasonable match to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix obtained directly from the 216 mock catalogues .",
    "however , the jk estimate of the off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix is noisier than that obtained from the mocks . in this analysis",
    "we construct the full covariance matrix of the measurement from the correlation matrix estimated from mock catalogues of dark matter haloes with similar clustering and abundance to the lrgs , rescaled by the jk estimate of the variance from the data , which has the advantage of being independent of the cosmological model adopted in the n - body simulation .",
    "small systematic effects including , for example , the integral constraint , calibration errors or evolutionary effects , will , if unaccounted for , appear as an additive term in the measured correlation function : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for the systematic error .",
    "the simplest model for @xmath23 is a constant shift , @xmath24 , which we label here as the _ k - shift_. systematic shifts include both effects which are unaccounted for in the estimate of the radial selection function and angular calibration errors which can move galaxies in or out of the galaxy sample .",
    "these can introduce spurious fluctuations in the observed density . a 1% variation in @xmath25 color or a 3% shift in @xmath26 magnitude can introduce a 10% modulation in the lrg target number density @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that the large scale density variations in the final lrg sample are completely consistent with the predictions of biased @xmath0cdm models , showing that when averaged over large angular scales , the fluctuations in the photometric calibration of the sdss do not affect significantly the uniformity of the lrg sample .",
    "even a spurious number density fluctuation as large as @xmath27 can only produce a shift @xmath28 . as illustrated in fig.[fig : corfunc ] the potential systematics that we are able to check seem to produce shifts of @xmath29 .",
    "these are small changes , but could our analysis below be affected by such a systematic effect , if present ?",
    "we have checked this explicitly by repeating our analysis allowing for a constant additive term @xmath30 as an extra free parameter , which we marginalize over .",
    "we imposed a prior on this k - shift as large as @xmath31 .",
    "this corresponds to 10% density fluctuations , well above the expected systematics in the lrg sample .",
    "we find that even with this wide prior in @xmath30 , the marginalization over the additive k - shift does not change the obtained errors of the cosmological parameters and only changes the mean values by less than 0.5@xmath14 in the most extreme cases .",
    "this small difference does not justify the inclusion of this extra parameter .",
    "but note that if we want to address the question of what is the _ absolute _ goodness of fit , then it might be important to consider such a k - shift as an additional degree of freedom .",
    "we will come back to this question in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the main piece of clustering information we shall use in this paper is the monopole or spherical average of the two - point redshift space correlation function described in the previous subsection .",
    "however , there is also useful cosmological information in the form of the correlation function split into bins of pair separation parallel ( @xmath32 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath14 ) to the line of sight , @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite found a significant detection of a peak along the line - of - sight direction , the position and shape of which is consistent with it being the baryonic acoustic peak .",
    "@xcite measured the position of the radial bao peak ( rbao ) using the full lrg dr6 sample , and two sub - samples at low , @xmath34 , and high redshifts , @xmath35 ( see their table ii ) . in this paper",
    "we make use of these two last measurements , which can be treated as independent due to the large separation between these redshift intervals .",
    "when combined with a measurement of the sound horizon scale from the cmb , the position of the bao feature can be used as a standard ruler to obtain a constraint on the value of the hubble parameter , @xmath36 , as a function of redshift @xcite . here ,",
    "instead of calibrating the radial bao distance @xmath37 with the cmb , we follow the same approach as @xcite and use the measurement of the dimensionless redshift scale @xmath38 in this equation @xmath39 is the hubble constant at the redshift of the measurement in the fiducial cosmology assumed by @xcite to convert the observed galaxy redshifts into comoving distances .",
    "note that the factor @xmath40 in eq .",

    "section  [ ssec : rbao_method ] describes the details of our modelling of these measurements .    because of the narrow range of @xmath14 values ( @xmath42 ) used in the radial measurement ,",
    "the rbao results are essentially independent from the monopole of the two - point function ; fewer than 1% of the bins considered in the spherically averaged correlation function are used in the estimate of the radial correlation . for this reason we treat these two datasets as independent .",
