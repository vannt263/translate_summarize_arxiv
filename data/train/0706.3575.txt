    "low energy electron transport in hybrid structures composed of a normal metal ( n ) and a superconductor ( s ) is governed by andreev reflection @xcite ( ar ) which causes non - zero subgap conductance @xcite of such structures .",
    "ar remains essentially a local effect provided there exists only one ns interface in the system or , else , if the distance between different ns interfaces greatly exceeds the superconducting coherence length @xmath0 .",
    "if , however , the distance @xmath1 between two adjacent ns interfaces ( i.e. the superconductor size ) is smaller than ( or comparable with ) @xmath0 , two additional _ non - local _ processes come into play ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . one such process corresponds to direct electron transfer between two n - metals through a superconductor .",
    "another process is the so - called crossed andreev reflection @xcite ( car ) : an electron penetrating into the superconductor from the first n - terminal may form a cooper pair together with another electron from the second n - terminal . in this case",
    "a hole will go into the second n - metal and ar becomes a non - local effect .",
    "both these processes contribute to the non - local conductance of hybrid multi - terminal structures which has been directly measured in several recent experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretically the non - local conductance of nsn hybrids was analyzed within the perturbation theory in the transmission of ns interfaces in refs . where it was demonstrated that in the lowest order in the interface transmission and at @xmath2 car contribution to cross - terminal conductance is exactly canceled by that from elastic electron cotunneling ( ec ) , i.e. the non - local conductance vanishes in this limit .",
    "thus , in order to determine the scale of the effect it is necessary to include higher order ( in the barrier transmission ) terms into consideration . the corresponding analysis was employed in refs . by means of effective `` dressing '' of both ec and car contributions by higher order processes and more recently by the present authors",
    "@xcite with the framework of quasiclassical formalism of eilenberger equations .",
    "we note that the results @xcite and @xcite disagree beyond perturbation theory since `` dressing '' procedure @xcite does not account for all higher order processes .",
    "hence , the approach @xcite is in general insufficient to correctly describe non - trivial interplay between normal reflection , tunneling , local ar and car to all orders in the interface transmissions .",
    "we will return to this issue further below .",
    "another interesting issue is the effect of disorder .",
    "it is well known that disorder enhances interference effects and , hence , can strongly modify local subgap conductance of ns interfaces in the low energy limit @xcite .",
    "non - local conductance of multi - terminal hybrid nsn structures in the presence of disorder was recently studied in refs . .",
    "brinkman and golubov made use of the quasiclassical formalism of usadel equations and proceeded perturbatively in the interface transmissions .",
    "duhot and melin @xcite discussed the impact of weak - localization - type of effects inside the superconductor on non - local electron transport in nsn structures .",
    "_ @xcite employed the circuit theory ( thereby going beyond perturbation theory in tunneling ) and considered a device with normal terminals attached to a superconductor via an additional _ normal _ island ( dot ) @xcite . very recently a similar structure with a _ superconducting _ dot was analyzed @xcite providing a rather general theoretical framework to study non - local electron transport in multi - terminal nsn structures in the presence of disorder and non - equilibrium effects .    yet another interesting",
    "subject is an interplay between car and coulomb interaction .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interactions on ar was investigated in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "interactions should also affect car , e.g. , by lifting the exact cancellation of ec and car contributions @xcite already in the lowest order in tunneling .",
    "a complete theory of non - local transport in realistic nsn systems should include both disorder and interactions which remains an important task for future investigations .",
    "an important property of both ar and car is that these processes should be sensitive to magnetic properties of normal electrodes because these processes essentially depend on spins of scattered electrons .",
    "one possible way to demonstrate spin - resolved car is to use ferromagnets ( f ) instead of normal electrodes ferromagnet - superconductor - ferromagnet ( fsf ) structures @xcite .",
    "first experiments on such fsf structures @xcite illustrated this point by demonstrating the dependence of non - local conductance on the polarization of ferromagnetic terminals .",
    "hence , for better understanding of non - local effects in multi - terminal hybrid proximity structures it is desirable to construct a theory of _ spin - resolved _ non - local transport .",
    "in the lowest order in tunneling this task was accomplished in ref . .",
    "for fsf structures higher orders in the interface transmissions were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are going to generalize our quasiclassical approach @xcite and construct a theory of non - local electron transport in ballistic nsn structures with spin - active interfaces to all orders in their transmissions .",
    "our model allows to distinguish spin - dependent contributions to the non - local conductance and to effectively mimic the situation of ferromagnetic and/or half - metallic electrodes .",

    "we will assume that both ns interfaces are spin - active , i.e. we will distinguish `` spin - up '' and `` spin - down '' transmissions of the first ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) and the second ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) sn interface .",
    "all these four transmissions may take any value from zero to one .",
