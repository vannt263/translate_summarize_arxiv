    "comparison of our calculated compression curves with that of @xcite suggests that in a closed system , fe@xmath2 present in the sample may tend to transform into fe@xmath0 by introduction of mg and o vacancies with increasing pressure , whose arrangements is still unclear .",
    "the spin crossover is also accompanied by a significant volume reduction and by an anomalous decrease in the bulk modulus across the crossover region , in contrast with previous calculations .",
    "further investigations of the effect of the spin crossover on elastic properties at lower mantle conditions are needed to better understand the thermal structure and the composition of the earth s lower mantle .",
    "the present study establishes a foundation for such study .",
    "here , we describe the br10 model which has been used to analyze the compression curve obtained by _ mao et al . _ , 2015 for the bridgmanite sample ( br10 ) containing fe@xmath0/@xmath86 @xmath87 20% in the octahedral sites ( si - sites ) and fe@xmath2/@xmath86 @xmath87 80% in the mg - sites .",
    "we model br10 by balancing the stoichiometry with appropriate molar fractions of ( mg@xmath12fe@xmath82)sio@xmath5 and ( mg@xmath12fe@xmath24)(si@xmath12fe@xmath24)o@xmath5 bridgmanite .",
    "we vary fe@xmath106/@xmath15fe from 10% to 20% to assess the effect of fe@xmath0 variation on the compression curve .",
    "the volume of br10 is modeled using an ideal solid solution between fe@xmath2- and fe@xmath0-bearing bridgmanite .",
    "the stoichiometry for the sample containing 10% fe@xmath106/@xmath15fe ( lower bound ) is obtained as follows : @xmath107 transferring equal amount of mgsio@xmath5 to both fe@xmath2- and fe@xmath0-bearing mgsio@xmath5 , we obtain @xmath108 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ ( mg_{0.99}fe^{3+}_{0.01})(si_{0.99}fe^{3+}_{0.01})o_3 - 0.495mgsio_3 \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & 0.02mgo - 0.005o_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or @xmath109 we chose to incorporate @xmath110 and @xmath111 as @xmath92 and @xmath93 vacancies in fe@xmath0-bearing mgsio@xmath5 : @xmath112.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation can be rearranged as @xmath113 where mg and o vacancies are constrained by fe@xmath0 concentration as @xmath114 = 2@xmath115 and @xmath116 = @xmath115 .",
    "owing to the fact that the total iron concentration in the sample is fixed , these stoichiometric coefficients are also constrained by @xmath89 . for the sample containing 10% [ fe@xmath98_{si}$]/@xmath15fe ( lower bound ) : @xmath117 = @xmath118 = 0.505 , @xmath14 = 0.15842 , and @xmath115 = 0.019802 .",
    "similarly for 20% [ fe@xmath98_{si}$]/@xmath15fe ( upper bound ) : @xmath117 = @xmath118 = 0.51 , @xmath14 = 0.11765 , @xmath115 = 0.039216 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the choice of the stoichiometric coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath118 in eq .",
    "[ br10_si ] is not unique .",
    "however , since the volume variation with respect to iron substitution in bridgmanite has been assumed to be linear and we are assuming an ideal solid solution of fe@xmath2- and fe@xmath0-bearing bridgmanite , other choices of @xmath117 and @xmath118 would provide the same estimate for the compression curve of our b10 model .",
