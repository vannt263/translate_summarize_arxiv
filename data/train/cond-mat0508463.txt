    "polarons as quasiparticles , in which the electronic excitations are strongly coupled to the lattice modes , have been studied theoretically for well over 50 years .",
    "nearly all these studies have been confined to models with only one or two electrons , and do not include the electron spin .",
    "such models have limited applicability and there is a need for studies of more realistic many - electron situations@xcite .",
    "there are technical problems , however , in handling such models as non - perturbative methods are required to describe the effects of strong electron - lattice interactions and few such methods are applicable to the many - electron case .",
    "progress has been made in recent years in dealing with models with strong local interactions via the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft)@xcite .",
    "calculations based on the holstein and holstein - hubbard models , where the electrons are coupled to local einstein lattice modes , have been made using the dmft to examine the effect of strong electron - phonon interactions on the mott transition@xcite , for example .",
    "the holstein model@xcite , however , was originally introduced to describe small polaron effects .",
    "within dmft , only the single electron case can be solved exactly@xcite .",
    "there have been few studies at finite electron densities and including the electron spin@xcite , except in one dimension@xcite .",
    "the problem is that if spin is included in the holstein model , there is an effective attractive local interaction between the electrons , which leads to local bipolaron formation and , away from half filling , superconductivity .",
    "once the electron spin is included the more realistic model is the holstein - hubbard model which includes an local electron repulsion @xmath2 . in most situations the repulsion @xmath2 dominates and undermines any tendency to the formation of local bipolarons . in the holstein - hubbard model at half filling with a large @xmath2 , the electron - phonon interaction plays no important role as charge fluctuations are suppressed ; its main effect is to renormalise and reduce the effective value of @xmath2@xcite . at half filling and",
    "small @xmath2 , where the electron - phonon coupling dominates , again there is little evidence@xcite of purely polaronic effects , because of the formation of bipolarons@xcite .",
    "the question arises , therefore , whether there is any parameter regime where purely polaronic effects can be observed .",
    "if there is , then does the behaviour correspond to the predictions based on the spinless models with only one or two electrons , or do many - electron correlations play a significant role ?    in this letter we present calculations to show clearly that small strongly renormalized polaronic excitations do exist in the holstein - hubbard model and form a distinct narrow band at the fermi level .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model is @xmath3 where @xmath4 describes the dispersion of the band electrons and @xmath2 is the on - site inter - electron repulsion as in the hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the electron density @xmath5 at site @xmath6 couples linearly to the local displacement operator @xmath7 with an electron - phonon coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the phonons are assumed to be dispersionless ( local einstein phonons ) with energy @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the mass of the vibrating ions .",
    "our calculations are based on dmft using a semi - elliptical density of states @xmath11 of the non - interacting system given by @xmath12 for @xmath13 and zero elsewhere , corresponding to a bethe lattice , where @xmath14 is the bandwidth and @xmath15 is the chemical potential .",
    "the effective impurity problem is solved using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite , as generalized for the calculation of dynamical response functions@xcite , and incorporating the density matrix generalization@xcite due to hofstetter .      to suppress any tendency for bipolaron formation",
    "we take a large value of the on - site repulsion , @xmath16 in units where @xmath17 , which for half filling corresponds to a mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "we choose a value of @xmath18 corresponding to quarter filling @xmath19 .",
    "the local density of states for @xmath20 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : g_spec_u60_x50 ] , with the fermi level such that the lower hubbard band is @xmath21 filled . in this regime",
    "the strong correlation effects are largely suppressed due to the charge fluctuations ; there is no sharp quasiparticle peak at the fermi level , which occurs for the small doping regime near half filling , and there is a moderately reduced quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath22 .",
    "the small spectral weight between the upper and lower bands is due to the tails in the broadening in the higher energy peaks of the discrete nrg results .      to study the impact of electrons coupling to phonons we concentrate on the lower hubbard band . in fig .",
    "[ fig : g_spec_u60_gx_x50 ] we show the effect of increasing the electron - phonon interaction @xmath8 , taking @xmath23 in all cases . as @xmath8 increases to the value @xmath24 a sharp feature develops at the fermi level which we attribute to a polaronic renormalization .",
    "due to the large @xmath2 , there is negligible double occupancy @xmath25 for this range of @xmath8 indicating no local bipolaron formation .",
    "to look at the band aspects of these excitations , we introduce the @xmath27-resolved one - electron green s function @xmath28 with a local self - energy @xmath29 , @xmath30 figure  [ fig : g_spec_k_u60_g60_x50 ] shows a plot of the spectral density of the green s function @xmath31 for @xmath32 and @xmath33 . when integrated over @xmath27 , it gives the local density of states for the corresponding @xmath8 shown in fig .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath0 with increase of @xmath8 is quite different from that near half filling where @xmath0 increases with increase of @xmath8 . near half filling the strong correlation effects stem from the enhancement of spin fluctuations and the suppression of charge fluctuations due to the large value of @xmath2 . in this regime",
    "the increase of @xmath0 with @xmath8 can be understood as due to the reduction in the effective value of @xmath2 , @xmath55 ; hence an increase in @xmath8 reduces @xmath56 and hence reduces the renormalization@xcite . the results for @xmath0 at quarter filling shown in fig .",

    "for the largest value of @xmath8 the value of @xmath1 becomes negative , even though @xmath60 .",
    "this can be interpreted as due to the fact the very low energy quasiparticles hardly ever occupy the same site due to correlation effects ( double occupancy @xmath61 ) and their effective attraction is due to retardation effects .      for values of @xmath62",
