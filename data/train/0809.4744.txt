    "recent evidences from supernova searches data [ 1,2 ] , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results [ 3 - 5 ] and also wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data [ 6,7 ] , indicate an positively accelerating phase of the cosmological expansion today and this feature shows that the simple picture of universe consisting of pressureless fluid is not enough . in this regard ,",
    "the universe may contain some sort of additional negative - pressure dark energy .",
    "analysis of the three year wmap data [ 8 - 10 ] shows that there is no indication for any significant deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity of the cmb power spectrum and therefore suggests that the universe is spatially flat to within the limits of observational accuracy .",
    "further , the combined analysis of the three - year wmap data with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) [ 8 ] , constrains the equation of state @xmath0 , corresponding to almost @xmath1 contribution of dark energy in the currently accelerating universe , to be very close to that of the cosmological constant value .",
    "moreover , observations appear to favor a dark energy equation of state , @xmath2 [ 11 ] . therefore a viable cosmological model should admit a dynamical equation of state that might have crossed the value @xmath3 , in the recent epoch of cosmological evolution .",
    "in fact , to explain positively accelerated expansion of the universe , there are two alternative approaches : incorporating an additional cosmological component or modifying gravity at cosmological scale .",
    "multi - component dark energy with at least one non - canonical phantom field is a possible candidate of the first alternative .",
    "this viewpoint has been studied extensively in literature ( see [ 12 ] and references therein ) .",
    "another alternative to explain current accelerated expansion of the universe is extension of general relativity to more general theories on cosmological scales . in this viewpoint ,",
    "modified einstein - hilbert action resulting @xmath4-gravity ( see [ 13 ] and references therein ) and braneworld gravity [ 14 - 16 ] are studied extensively . for instance , dgp ( dvali - gabadadze - porrati ) braneworld scenario as an ir modification of general relativity explains accelerated expansion of the universe in its positive branch via leakage of gravity to extra dimension . in this model ,",
    "equation of state parameter of dark energy never crosses @xmath5 line , and universe eventually turns out to be de sitter phase .",
    "but , in this setup if we use a single scalar field ( ordinary or phantom ) on the brane , we can show that equation of state parameter of dark energy can cross phantom divide line ( pdl ) [ 17 ] .",
    "also quintessential behavior can be achieved in a geometrical way in higher order theories of gravity [ 18 ] .    from another view point ,",
    "impact of lorentz invariance violation ( liv ) on cosmology has been studied recently [ 19,20 ] .",
    "this issue has been studied in the context of scalar - vector - tensor theories [ 19 ] .",
    "it has been shown that lorentz violating vector fields affect the dynamics of the inflationary models .",
    "one of the interesting feature of this scenario is that the exact lorentz violating inflationary solutions are related to the absence of the inflaton potential . in this case",
    ", the inflation is completely associated with the lorentz invarance violation and depends on the value of the coupling parameters [ 20 ] .",
    "one important observation has been made in reference [ 21 ] which accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line with one minimally coupled scalar field in the presence of a lorentz invariance violating vector field has been shown .",
    "this model is essentially an interacting model which consists of interaction between scalar field and lorentz violating vector field .",
    "one important consequence in quintessence model is the fact that a single minimally coupled scalar field has not the capability to explain crossing of phantom divide line , @xmath6 [ 22 ] .",
    "however , a single but non - minimally coupled scalar field is enough to cross the phantom divide line by its equation of state parameter [ 12 ] .",
    "currently , models of phantom divide line crossing are so important that they can realize that which model is better than the others to describe the nature of dark energy . in this respect , possible crossing of phantom divide line by equation of state parameter in model universes with a non - minimally coupled scalar field and lorentz invariance violation is important .    with this preliminaries , the purpose of this paper is to study late time acceleration and phantom divide line crossing in two model universes : a model universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field in the presence of lorentz invariance symmetry and a model universe with a lorentz invariance violating dark energy component with minimal coupling . in the former case",
    "we extend our study to moving domain wall picture of braneworld scenario . in this regard , we first study cosmological consequences of a non - minimally coupled scalar field . in this stage , with a numerical analysis of parameters space of the model , we show that accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line are explainable in the jordan frame . by transforming to einstein s frame , we show that this model can not account for crossing of phantom divide line .",
    "our strategy differs with existing literature in its special kind of numerical reasoning based on an appropriate ansatz .",
    "then we extend this model to a braneworld setup . in this extension ,",
    "brane is considered to be a moving domain wall in a background @xmath7-dimensional anti de sitter - schwarzschild ( adss@xmath8 ) black hole bulk . in other words ,",
    "we consider a static bulk configuration with two @xmath7-dimensional anti de sitter - schwarzschild black hole spaces joined by a moving domain wall .",
    "then we study dynamics of equation of state parameter of a non - minimally coupled scalar field in this setup .",
    "this model has also capability to explain accelerated expansion and phantom divide line crossing in a fascinating manner",
    ". then we summarize cosmological equations of a lorentz invariance violating model in the spirit of scalar - vector - tensor theories .",
    "we find a relation between lorentz invariance violation parameter and dynamics of scalar field .",
    "this relation explicitly shows the interactive nature of our lorentz invariance violating model .",
    "this model , with a minimally coupled scalar field accounts for crossing of phantom divide line and also accelerated expansion .",
    "there are three important outcomes of our study : it is impossible to cross phantom divide line with a single and minimally coupled scalar field but non - minimal coupling of scalar field in the jordan frame provides such an important feature . a non - minimally coupled scalar field on the moving domain wall is a good candidate for dark energy which explains both late - time acceleration and phantom divide line crossing",
    "also , a lorentz invariance violation model with a minimally coupled scalar field accounts for late - time acceleration and phantom divide line crossing .",
    "it is important to note that non - minimal coupling of a scalar field and gravity may provides a basis for symmetry ( such as lorentz invariance ) breaking as has been argued in reference [ 23 ] . to complete our study , based on recent observational data we obtain some important constraints on the parameters of the models in the favor of late - time",
    "accelerated expansion .",
    "for a model universe with a non - minimally coupled scalar field as matter content of the universe , the action in the absence of other matter sources in the jordan frame can be written as follows @xmath9-\\frac{1}{2 } g^{\\mu\\nu } \\nabla_{\\mu}\\phi\\nabla_{\\nu}\\phi -v(\\phi ) \\bigg],\\ ] ] where we have included an explicit and general non - minimal coupling of scalar field and gravity .",

    "now , equation ( 9 ) takes the following form @xmath30 and dynamics of equation of state parameter is given by @xmath31 from this equation , when @xmath32 , we obtain @xmath33 . in this case",
    "@xmath25 is independent of @xmath34 and @xmath35 plays the role of a cosmological constant . in the minimal case when @xmath36 , using ( 9 ) we obtain @xmath37 which shows an accelerated expansion which is driven by cosmological constant .",
    "however , cosmological constant is not a good candidate for dark energy since its suffers from several conceptual problems such as its unknown origin and also need to huge amount of fine - tuning . in non - minimal case",
    "the cosmological dynamics depends on the value of non - minimal coupling . as a first goal in this paper",
    "we try to see whether late - time accelerated expansion and crossing of phantom divide line are explainable with this non - minimally coupled scalar field as candidate for dark energy or not .",
    "although this issue is not new , our strategy for this purpose differs from existing approaches ( see for instance [ 12 ] ) . to have positively accelerated expansion",

    "in fact in general relativity , and in all other metric theories of gravity in which the scalar field is not part of the gravitational sector , such a conformal coupling with @xmath41 is necessary .",
    "then we obtain @xmath42 by imposing the weak energy condition and restricting study to the case with @xmath43 , one finds [ 24 ] @xmath44 and a necessary condition for cosmic acceleration is therefore @xmath45    in this case to have cosmic acceleration with @xmath46 , the potential @xmath35 should vary with @xmath18 slower than power - law potential @xmath47 . however , when @xmath48 , the necessary condition for cosmic acceleration requires that @xmath49 grow faster than @xmath50 as @xmath18 increases [ 24 ] . as a specific example to show how this model works , if we set @xmath51 , condition ( 17 ) gives @xmath52 which yields @xmath53 .",

    "thus non - minimal coupling of scalar field and gravity in the jordan frame provides a suitable framework for explanation of late - time accelerated expansion .",
    "note that with negative sign in equation ( 22 ) it is impossible to find a positive @xmath68 .    on the other hand , with above ansatz , dynamics of equation of state parameter for a non - minimally coupled scalar field",

    "in fact , conformal transformation from jordan frame to einstein frame transforms the equation of state parameter to its minimal form but with a redefined scalar field and in this case it is impossible to achieve phantom phase ( and therefore no crossing of phantom divide line ) .",
    "in this section we show that a minimally coupled scalar field localized on the brane provides even more suitable candidate for explanation of accelerated expansion and phantom divide line crossing . with this motivation ,",

    "we consider a static bulk configuration with two @xmath7-dimensional anti de sitter - schwarzschild ( adss@xmath8 ) black hole spaces joined by a moving domain wall . to embed this moving domain wall into @xmath7-dimensional bulk , it is then necessary to specify normal and tangent vectors to this domain wall with careful determination of normal direction to the brane .",

    "observers on the moving domain wall interprets their motion through the static @xmath7-dimensional bulk background as cosmological expansion or contraction .",

    "this line element shows a topological anti de sitter black hole geometry in each side . using israel junction conditions [ 29 ] and gauss - codazzi equations we find the following generalization of the friedmann and acceleration equations @xmath104 @xmath105 where we have adapted a @xmath106-symmetry with @xmath107 and @xmath108",

    "note that @xmath112 is the coefficient of a term which is called holographic matter term . for @xmath110 , each",
    "sub - manifolds of bulk spacetime are exact ads@xmath8 spacetimes .",
    "now we consider a localized non - minimally coupled scalar field on the brane and discuss its cosmological implications especially on late - time dynamics . in this case",
    "we use energy density and pressure of scalar field defined in equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) as the only matter source on the brane . in this case ,",
    "equation ( 38 ) takes the following form @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath29 is hubble parameter on the moving domain wall .",
    "this is a complicate relation and to explain its cosmological implications , we have to consider either some limiting cases or specify @xmath115 , @xmath35 and @xmath18 .",
    "one can apply the ansatz introduced in the last section with conformal coupling of scalar field and ricci scalar on the brane to investigate late time behavior of this equation .",
    "but , due to existence of several fine - tunable parameters and a combination of plus and minus signs in this relation , essentially it is possible to find a domain of parameters space that satisfies the condition @xmath116 in the favor of positively accelerated expansion .",
    "for instance , if we set @xmath117 with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 , then equation ( 39 ) gives @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 figure @xmath7 shows the possibility of accelerated expansion ( @xmath125 for @xmath60 in some appropriate domain of parameter space ( for example with @xmath126 and @xmath127 ) ) .",
    "the case with @xmath128 accounts for accelerated expansion in even more simpler manner due to its wider parameter space . in this braneworld setup ,",

    ", the holographic dark energy models studied in ref . [ 22 ] have the phantom phase by adopting a native equation of state , whereas the authors in [ 36 ] have found accelerating phase only using the effective equation of state .",

    "of course , an attractor solutions and fine - tuning in lorentz violation model for suitable inflation phase has been studied in ref.[20 ] .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to expect that one of them will eventually dominate to explain inflation or accelerating phase and crossing of phantom divided line .",

    "equation of dynamics for @xmath200 implicitly has an important meaning : by a suitable fine tuning one can construct a lorentz violating cosmology consistent with observational data . in another words , this setup provides an important basis for testing liv in cosmological context .",
    "although many different models can also lead to phantom divided barrier crossing , our model is special in this respect since it contains only one scalar field and the presence of lorentz violating vector field and interactive nature of this model control the crossing . in this sense ,",
    "fine tuning of parameters space based on observational data restricts the value that @xmath200 can attain .",
    "any non - vanishing value of @xmath176 in our model shows violation of lorentz symmetry in this cosmological setup .",
    "lorentz invariance violating inflation models constraint by wmap and other observational data may provide other tests of liv in cosmological setup . to see possible detection of lorentz - violating fields in cosmology",
    "see [ 31,32,33 ] . in the presence of liv ,",
    "just one scalar field is enough to achieve phantom divide barrier crossing and existence of vector field controls the situation .",
    "two important point should be stressed here : firstly , as figure @xmath197 shows , there are some sudden jumps of the equation of state . in many existing models",
    "whose equation of state can cross the phantom divide line , @xmath108 undulates around @xmath201 randomly ( [ 34 ] and references therein ) .",
    "these jumps are actually a manifestation of this undulation which may be a signature of chaotic behavior of equation of state during its evolution .",
    "secondly , as these figures show , crossing of the phantom divide line can occur at late - time .",
    "this fact , as second cosmological coincidence , needs additional fine - tuning in model parameters and trigger mechanism , for instance , can be used to alleviate this coincidence .",
    "light - curves analysis of several hundreds type ia supernovae , wmap observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation and other cmb - based experiments have shown that our universe is currently in a period of accelerated expansion . in this respect ,",
    "construction of theoretical frameworks with potential to describe positively accelerated expansion and crossing of the phantom divide line by equation of state parameter , itself is an interesting challenge . according to existing literature on dark energy models , a _ minimally _ coupled scalar field is not a good candidate for dark energy model with equation of state parameter crossing the phantom divide line . on the other hand , a scalar field _",
    "non - minimally _ coupled to gravity in the jordan frame has the capability to be a suitable candidate for dark energy which provides this facilities .",
    "although this issue has been studied in literature , our study here is different in its different approach based on numerical analysis of parameter space .",
    "we have extended this study to a barneworld setup where brane has been considered as a moving domain wall in a static bulk background . in this braneworld setup ,",
    "non - minimally coupled scalar field provides even more reliable candidate for dark energy .",
    "then we have extended our study to the lorentz invariance violating dark energy model .",
    "we have shown that a minimally coupled scalar field in the presence of a lorentz violating vector field provides a good candidate for dark energy with capability of describing late - time acceleration and phantom divide line crossing .",
    "one important observation here is the fact that this model achieve an interactive nature which this interaction is responsible for late - time acceleration and phantom divide line crossing . as some details of our analysis",
    ", we emphasize that due to complication of dynamical equations , we have restricted our study to some specific form of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potentials and also we have considered some special form of time evolution for scale factor and scalar field .",
    "these choices , though especial , are natural and motivated from powerful grounds based on recent observational data .",
    "crossing of phantom divide barrier by a single scalar field in the presence of a lorentz violating vector field and with suitable fine tuning of model parameters in an interactive picture , is an important outcome in this context .",
    "this feature is more considerable were we emphasize that in the absence of lorentz invariance violating vector field , it is impossible to cross phantom divide line just by one scalar field minimally coupled to gravity . + * acknowledgment * + this work has been supported partially by research institute for astronomy and astrophysics of maragha , iran .",
    "we would like to thank an anonymous referee for his / her important contribution in this work .",
