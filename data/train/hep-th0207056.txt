    "this potential has minimum away from @xmath0 at non - zero values of @xmath1 , and it is easy to show that these non - zero values represent possible stable ground states for the theory .    for flat minkowski spacetime , the homogeneity and isotropy of the spacetime imply that the ground state must be constant .",
    "however it is easy to envisage a situation in which this is no longer the case , even for homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes .",
    "a simple example was provided by avis and isham  @xcite where the spatial section of the spacetime was a torus . in this case , since a real scalar field is regarded as a cross - section of the real - line bundle with the spacetime as the base space , there is the possibility of a twisted field .",
    "an equivalent , but simpler , observation is that we could choose antiperiodic boundary conditions for the field on the torus just as well as periodic boundary conditions .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions mean that the only constant field solution consistent with the boundary conditions is the zero field . for the double - well potential ,",
    "this raises the interesting question of what the ground state is if can not correspond to a minimum of the potential .",
    "what avis and isham  @xcite showed was that if the torus was below a critical size set by the parameters of the double - well potential , @xmath0 was the stable ground state ; however , if the torus was larger than the critical size , @xmath0 was not stable , and the stable ground state was a spatially dependent solution .",
    "thus the boundary conditions can prohibit constant , non - zero field solutions , and make the determination of the ground state more complicated .",
