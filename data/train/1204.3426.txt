    "even with long ( tens of hours ) exposures on 810 m class telescopes , optical / nir observations can only detect the ly@xmath2 line and the underlying uv stellar continuum . indeed , essentially all of our current knowledge on these key reionization sources is based on the highly resonant ly@xmath2 line and the faint underlying continuum , which is potentially affected by dust attenuation , and generally difficult to interpret due to the complexity of the ly@xmath2 radiative transfer .",
    "observations of the ( sub)millimeter continuum and spectral lines in principle provide the means by which to constrain key physical parameters of the highest redshift sources ( e.g. , size , mass , distribution of the star  forming interstellar medium ( ism ) and star formation , as well as dynamical masses ) .",
    "traditionally , co emission lines are used to characterize the molecular reservoirs in high redshift galaxies ( e.g. reviews by solomon & vanden bout 2005 , walter , carilli & daddi 2011 ) . however , the expected co line strengths even in the brightest z@xmath76.5 ( non  agn ) galaxies are @xmath310s of @xmath0jy  such faint lines are not accessible given current facilities and will even be a challenge with alma .",

    "<S> we present a search for the  158@xmath0 m fine structure line ( a main cooling line of the interstellar medium ) and the underlying far  infrared ( fir ) continuum in three high  redshift ( 6.6@xmath1z@xmath18.2 ) star  forming galaxies using the iram plateau de bure interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> we targeted two lyman@xmath2selected galaxies ( lyman  alpha  emitters , laes ) with moderate uv  based star formation rates ( sfr@xmath320m@xmath4yr@xmath5 ; _ himiko _ at z=6.6 and _ iok1 _ at z=7.0 ) and a gamma ray burst ( grb ) host galaxy ( _ grb090423 _ at z@xmath38.2 ) . based on our 3@xmath6 rest  </S>",
    "<S> frame fir continuum limits , previous ( rest  frame ) uv continuum measurements and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , we rule out sed shapes similar to highly obscured galaxies ( e.g. arp220 , m82 ) and less extreme dust  rich nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. m51 ) for the laes . conservatively assuming a sed shape typical of local spiral galaxies we derive upper limits for the fir  based star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath370m@xmath4yr@xmath5 , @xmath350m@xmath4yr@xmath5 and @xmath340m@xmath4yr@xmath5 for _ himiko _ , _ iok1 _ and _ grb090423 _ , respectively . for the laes </S>",
    "<S> these limits are only a factor @xmath33 higher than the published uv  based sfrs ( uncorrected for extinction ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the dust obscuration in the z@xmath76 laes studied here is lower by a factor of a few than what has recently been found in some laes at lower redshift ( 2@xmath1z@xmath13.5 ) with similar uv  based sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> a low obscuration in our z@xmath76 lae sample is consistent with recent rest  frame uv studies of z@xmath37 lyman  break  galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>"
