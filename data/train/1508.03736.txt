    "these substructures , much like those seen in the halo system of the milky way , are sensitive to recent ( within the last @xmath6  gyr ) merging events , and are more prominent in the outer region of the halo ( galactocentric radii beyond @xmath7  kpc ) , whereas the inner - halo region appears significantly smoother .",
    "based on data from the segue spectroscopic survey , @xcite found that metal - poor main - sequence turnoff stars in the inner - halo region of the milky way ( within @xmath8  kpc from the sun ) exhibit clear evidence for radial velocity clustering on small spatial scales ( they refer to these as echos , for elements of cold halo substructure ) .",

    "prominent examples are the two stellar debris streams in the halo population passing close to the sun detected by @xcite when combining high - quality hipparcos proper motions with ground - based observations . formed via destruction of a satellite",

    "the case study is that , of all the objects passing within a few kiloparsecs of the sun , some are part of a diffuse local stellar halo , while some could be debris of accretion events and remnants from the outer - halo population currently in the solar neighbourhood .    before starting to look for kinematic substructures",

    "[ prf : fig5 ] .",

    "[ prf : fig7 ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , retrograde satellites experience weaker dynamical friction and leave more particles in the outer - halo region , since their orbits have a longer decay time and longer periods .",
    "thus , tidal stripping ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can act longer and more efficiently when the satellite is still orbiting at high velocity , and we see that a better populated high - velocity tail results ( compare fig .",

    "the impact of dynamical friction on the two configurations considered for the retrograde satellites indicates that the high - inclination case is the one less affected by this force , which again results in efficient stripping when the satellite has high orbital velocity .",

    "however , we can not exclude that these groups belong to different impacting satellites on retrograde orbits with inclinations within that same range . a more detailed analysis of the chemical abundances of the three detected groups , as well as more quantitative comparisons to extended simulations , are necessary to resolve this issue .    in any event ,",
    "the fastest objects appear with positive and negative @xmath120 values ( i.e. prograde and retrograde motions , respectively ) in the angular momentum @xmath565 regions for high - inclination orbits ( @xmath603 ) . on the other hand , for low - inclination both observations and simulations",

    "this asymmetric distribution is suggestive of the role played by dynamical friction during accretion .    in anticipation of the much improved data expected over the coming years ,",
    "in particular the gaia catalogue and the new ground - based spectroscopic surveys , we also investigated the impact of observational errors in our dynamical simulations .",
    "the analysis indicates that ( see the relevant panels of figs .",
    "[ prf : fig8 ] and  [ prf : fig10 ] ) gaia will greatly influence these studies : for , velocity and angular momentum distribution will be almost completely dominated by the physics we are trying to recover , i.e. , the dynamical history of the merging events .    at that point ,",
    "full grids ( in , e.g. , inclination and amount of rotation ) of prograde and retrograde high resolution satellite simulations will be required to precisely characterise the debris detected . then , we will be able to number the merging events for direct comparison with the predictions of the ( @xmath604)cdm theory and its associated merging paradigm .    in conclusion , the results shown might lead us to claim that the inner halo might have  seen \" only two events ; however the large uncertainties in the extant data , mostly observational , do not exclude the possibility that the events might be as many as four , and perhaps more given the intrinsic difficulty of our technique to deal with low inclination prograde mergers .",
