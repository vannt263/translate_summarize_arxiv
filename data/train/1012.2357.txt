    "the presence of strong , globally - organized magnetic fields in hot , massive stars is rare . to date , only a handful of massive o - type stars are known to host magnetic fields . in 2009 , grunhut et al . reported the discovery of a strong magnetic field in the weak - wind o9iv star hd57682 from the presence of zeeman signatures in mean least - squares deconvolved ( lsd ) stokes  @xmath1 profiles ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "grunhut et al .",
    "also used @xmath2 ultraviolet and espadons optical spectroscopy to determine the following physical parameters using cmfgen : @xmath3kk , @xmath4 , @xmath5@xmath6 , @xmath7@xmath8 , and @xmath9@xmath8yr@xmath10 .",
    "of particular interest , we highlight the low mass - loss rate derived from uv wind diagnostic lines , which show variability characteristic of other magnetic ob stars ( e.g. schnerr et al . 2008 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    with only 7 observations of this star at our disposal at that time we employed a bayesian inference method to determine the best - fitting dipole parameters to characterize the magnetic field ( petit et al .",
    "in prep ) .",
    "we concluded that the dipolar field of hd57682 is characterized by a polar strength of @xmath111.7 kg , and a magnetic axis aligned within 10 to 50@xmath12 of the rotation axis , depending on the inclination of the rotation axis to our line of sight .    since our original report of this star in 2009",

    "both the longitudinal magnetic field and h@xmath0 equivalent width of hd57682 are strongly variable . in addition to our 17 espadons observations , we ve also utilized h@xmath0 observations from amateur spectroscopy from the bess database , as well as archival eso uves and feros observations dating back over a decade . a period search of these data resulted in a period of @xmath1131d , consistent with the maximum original rotational period estimated by grunhut et al .",
    "however , the magnetic data could not be reasonably phased with this period . ultimately , adopting a period of 63.58d ( twice the period obtained from the h@xmath0 data ) resulted in a coherent phasing of all the data at our disposal , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sidebyside].this period is inconsistent with the fundamental parameters derived by grunhut et al .",
    ", likely indicating that the @xmath14 is too high by nearly a factor of two .",
    "the longitudinal magnetic field appears to vary sinusoidally , consistent with a magnetic field dominated by a strong dipolar component .",
    "the h@xmath0 equivalent width shows a double - wave pattern with peak emission occurring at the magnetic crossover phases ( i.e. when the longitudinal field is null ) .",
    "the photometric light curve from hipparcos shows no apparent variability .",
    "this likely indicates that the column density of the magnetically confined plasma is relatively low at eclipse phases .",

    "we are capable of fitting a dipole model ( characterized by the magnetic field strength at the poles ( @xmath15 ) and the angle of obliquity of the magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis ( @xmath16 ) ) to the longitudinal component of the magnetic field , measured from the mean lsd stokes @xmath1 and @xmath13 profiles . however",
    ", since we do not have any constraints on the inclination angle of the rotation axis , we can only estimate that @xmath17 kg and @xmath18 .    in fig .",
    "[ chisq ] we show the residual variations of h@xmath0 phased with the adopted rotational period .",
    "we conclude based on the characteristics of this dynamic spectrum that the magnetic field is exerting strong confinement ( confinement parameter @xmath19 ; ud - doula & owocki 2002 ) on the weak wind of hd57682 , resulting in the observed h@xmath0 variability .",
    "however , the slow rotation is likely unable to centrifugally support a stable magnetosphere .",
