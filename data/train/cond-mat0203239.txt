    "a number of _ living soft matters _ derive their strength from some composite structures .",
    "tooth and timber are among the examples .",
    "these composite structures have motivated studies mainly in industry or technology - oriented field to produce strong materials , such as raw material for construction or air plane and automobile tires .",
    "kelly , clegg , composites one of the purposes of this paper is to present some complementary understandings of such a problem from a viewpoint of a physicist .    in the first of this series of papers ,",
    "@xcite which deepened the scaling picture presented in @xcite , we studied nacre currey , jackson , sarikaya , rao which has an alternating laminated structure of hard and soft layers ( fig .",
    "one of the significant features of this substance lies in the length scale of the layers .",
    "the thicknesses of hard inorganic layer @xmath3 and that of the soft organic layer @xmath4 are of the order of nanometer and micron , respectively .",
    "this allows us a coarse - grained treatment in which _ average deformation field _ may be well defined and can be used for the analysis of the field _ even near the tip_. simplifying the coarse - grained elastic energy further in terms of fourier components of the deformation field , which is somewhat different from conventional approaches , @xcite we could show analytical solutions and thereby demonstrate one possible mechanism for the toughness of nacre for a perpendicular crack .",
    "this paper does not concern the enhancement in toughness as opposed to the title .",
    "rather , we proceed to study a case of parallel crack with the fixed grip condition from _ the continuum view _",
    "( as for non - continuum treatment on laminated composites , see for example , @xcite ) . as we see later",
    ", this coarse - grained treatment again leads to a reasonably simplified picture of the problem . to describe the fields near the tip",
    ", we shall find that an extra term is required in our elastic energy .",
    "this term introduces a new length scale @xmath5 , as we see below , and the extra term becomes important near the tip ( @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is the distance from the tip ) .",
    "this term is suggested previously concerning some smectic liquid crystal @xcite and a _ lenticular _ tip form is predicted from scaling arguments .",
    "@xcite here , we obtain an analytical solution to the stress and deformation distribution near the tip ; the tip form in this case takes also the lenticular form .",
    "the appearance of a _ parabolic _",
    "differential equation for the deformation field due to the extra term is another feature of this paper .",
    "we also obtain an analytical solution for @xmath7 , which allows us to estimate the fracture energy ; there is no energy enhancement within our treatment .",
    "the young modulus of the hard and soft layer are denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively , where @xmath10 in the following , we consider the case of parallel fractures under the plane strain condition , i.e. @xmath11 ( fig .",

    ", we can introduce _ macroscopic strain field _ to have the following elastic energy @xcite @xmath18where @xmath19we have assumed that the poisson ratio is the same for both layers for simplicity ( even if @xmath20 , or @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are typically of the same order ) .",
    "we have checked ( for the perpendicular crack ) the stress distribution resulting from this energy exhibits small change over a few layers , which justifies the above assumption .",
    "the strain - stress relation results from this energy by the relation @xmath24 :    @xmath25      near the fracture tip , the stress gradient is large ; we may need to include the stress changes within a single layer in some cases . in the case of parallel fracture ,",
    "the bending , which originates from the non - uniform stress , is important as we see below .",
    "the correction due to the bending effect is given by ( neglecting the bending energy of the soft layer )    @xmath26where the bending moduli is given by @xcite @xmath27the total energy is then given by @xmath28as we see later , in the case of parallel fracture , the first term in @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) becomes negligible ; the remaining terms in @xmath29 are all associated with the weak modulus @xmath9 while the bending term is associated with the strong modulus @xmath8 .",
    "this suggests the possibility that _ this higher - order derivative term make a significant contribution to the energy in the parallel fracture . _    in accordance with the introduction of the bending term",
    ", we have another length scale @xmath5 as announced : @xmath30",
    "as we see below , at large scale where @xmath31 , we have @xmath32 , and the elastic energy is simplified to @xmath33    at small scale @xmath34 , we also have @xmath35 and the elastic energy is simplified to @xmath36this energy in eq .",
