    "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are thought to be the carrier of the ubiquitously observed mid - ir emission bands ( * ? ? ? * among others ) .",
    "the bands are the result of vibrational de - excitation of the pah skeleton through bending and stretching modes of c - h and c - c bonds after the absorption of a uv photon .",
    "the emission in these bands can be very bright and can comprise a significant fraction , up to 10@xmath620% @xcite , of the total infrared emission from a galaxy .",
    "for this reason , pah emission has been suggested to be a useful tracer of the star - formation rate , even out to high redshifts @xcite . making use of pahs as a tracer",
    ", however , requires understanding how the abundance and emission from pahs depends on galaxy properties such as metallicity and star - formation history .",
    "pahs also play a number of important roles in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in particular , these small dust grains can dominate photoelectric heating rates @xcite .",
    "in dense clouds , pahs can alter chemical reaction networks by providing a neutralization route for ionized species @xcite and contribute large amounts of surface area for chemical reactions that occur on grain surfaces .",
    "pahs are a crucial component of interstellar dust so we would like to understand the processes that govern their abundance and physical state .",
    "the life - cycle of pahs , however , is not yet well understood .",
    "pahs are thought to form in the carbon - rich atmospheres of some evolved stars @xcite .",
    "emission from pahs has been observed from carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite and more frequently in carbon - rich post - agb stars where the radiation field is more effective at exciting the mid - ir bands @xcite .",
    "a `` stardust '' origin ( i.e. formation in the atmospheres of evolved stars ) for the majority of pah material is controversial , however , because it has yet to be demonstrated that pahs can be produced in agb stars faster than they are destroyed in the ism ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , i.e. the timescale for destruction of dust by sne shocks is shorter than the timescale over which the ism is enriched with dust from agb stars ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to destruction by supernova shocks , pah material may be destroyed by uv fields , a process that can dominate near a hot star or in the ism of low metallicity and/or primordial galaxies .",
    "if pahs are mostly not `` stardust '' , they must have formed in the ism itself , by some mechanism which is not yet characterized . a variety of mechanisms have been suggested @xcite however there is little observational support for any one model as of yet .    in recent years , observations with iso and _",
    "spitzer _ have allowed us to study the abundance and physical state of pahs in a variety of ism conditions beyond those we observe in the milky way .",
    "one of the most striking results is the abrupt change in the fraction of dust in pahs as a function of metallicity .",
    "a deficit of pah emission from low metallicity galaxies has been widely observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the ratio of the 8 to 24 surface brightness undergoes a transition from a sed with typical pah emission to an sed essentially devoid of pah emission at a metallicity of 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath7 .",
    "the weakness of pah emission in low - metallicity galaxies has been confirmed spectroscopically @xcite . using the sings galaxy sample @xcite modeled the integrated seds and determined that the deficit of pah emission corresponds to a decrease in the pah fraction rather than a change in excitation of the pahs .",
    "they found that @xmath2  ( defined as the fraction of the total dust mass that is contributed by pahs containing less than @xmath8 carbon atoms ) changes from a median of @xmath9% ( comparable to the milky way pah fraction of 4.6% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in galaxies with 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath10 to a median of @xmath11% in more metal poor galaxies .",
    "@xcite have investigated the radial variation of @xmath2  and metallicity in the sings sample and find results consistent with @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of suggestions as to what in the pah life - cycle changes at low metallicity leading to the observed deficiency .",
    "@xcite suggested that the delay between enrichment of the ism by supernova - produced dust relative to that from agb stars could lead to a lower pah fraction at low metallicity .",
    "this model relies on the assumption that supernovae contribute a significant amount of dust to the ism , an assumption which is controversial @xcite , as well as long timescales for dust production in carbon - rich agb stars , which may be shorter than previously thought @xcite .",
    "fundamentally , the @xcite model assumes a `` stardust '' origin for pahs , which may not be the case .",
    "other models explaining the low metallicity deficiency rely on enhanced destruction of pahs . this can be accomplished through more efficient destruction via supernova shocks @xcite or via the harder and more intense uv fields in these galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in order to investigate the pah life cycle at low metallicity , we performed two surveys of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) with the _ spitzer _ space telescope .",

    "the smc has a low dust - to - gas ratio , @xmath13 times smaller than in the milky way @xcite , leading to more pervasive uv fields . because of its proximity we can observe the ism at high spatial resolution and sensitivity in order to characterize the processes driving the pah fraction .",
    "the pah fraction in the smc has been controversial .",
    "@xcite , using iras and cobe data , found that the pahs in the smc bar contained only 0.4% of the interstellar carbon , corresponding to @xmath2@xmath14 0.2% , whereas @xcite concluded that pahs accounted for 4.8% of the total dust mass in the diffuse ism of the smc , similar to the milky way . in the following , we present results on the fraction of pahs in the smc using observations from the _ spitzer _ survey of the small magellanic cloud ( s@xmath0mc ) .",

    "the mosaics were constructed using the mopex software provided by the ssc .",
    "the irac and mips mosaics were corrected for a number of artifacts as described in @xcite .",
    "the most important of these for the purposes of this work is the large additive gradients at irac wavelengths ( primarily 5.8 and 8.0 ) caused by varying offsets in the detectors and the mosaicing algorithm implemented in mopex .",
    "we will discuss these gradients further in section  [ sec : fg ] since they become important for determining the foregrounds present in our maps .",
    "since the initial processing of the mips mosaics , the calibration factors recommended by the ssc have been revised .",
    "we correct the mosaics to use the recommended factors of 0.0454 , 702 and 41.7 mjy sr@xmath15 per instrumental data unit , which are 3% , 11% and 0.7% different from the earlier values used by @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the details of the data reduction are discussed in @xcite . in brief , the maps were assembled using cubism , wherein a `` slit loss correction function '' was applied , analogous to the extended source correction for the irac bands , to adjust the calibration from point sources to extended objects @xcite . each mapping observation was followed or preceded by an observation of a designated `` off '' position at r.a .",

    "in the mid- and far - infrared there are three major foreground / background contributions that contaminate our observations of the smc : the zodiacal emission , milky way cirrus emission and the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) .",
    "in addition , for the irac mosaics there is a planar offset introduced by varying detector offsets and the mosaicing algorithm in mopex ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "these need to be removed from the maps to isolate the emission from the smc . in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss the foreground subtraction that has been carried out on our data and the major uncertainties in this process .",
    "the approach we use to subtract these foregrounds is motivated by the following limitations of our observations : ( 1 ) at longer wavelengths the mosaics do not extend to areas with no smc emission , ( 2 ) the observations of neutral hydrogen which we use to subtract the milky way cirrus emission have a lower angular resolution than our _ spitzer _ maps and ( 3 ) the residual mosaicing gradients in the 5.8 , 8.0 and to a lesser degree 4.5  irac bands interfere with directly fitting and subtracting the zodiacal light .",
    "our foreground subtraction has three steps : ( 1 ) we determine the coefficients of a planar surface that describe the combination of zodiacal light and the residual mosaicing offsets , ( 2 ) we subtract this plane from each map at its native resolution , ( 3 ) we convolve the maps to the mips 160  resolution of 40  and subtract the mw cirrus foreground and cib . throughout this procedure",

    "the zodiacal light is well - described by a plane and the gradients introduced by the mosaicing algorithm also have a planar dependence @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are no `` off '' locations where we could simply fit a plane to the foreground level , since no regions are totally free of smc emission in the s@xmath0mc maps . at each position in the map",
    "the surface brightness is a combination of : smc emission , mw cirrus emission , zodiacal light , mosaicing offsets and cib . to isolate the planar component ,",
    "we first extract photometry for a number of @xmath28 regions from the irac and mips maps .",
    "we choose the regions to be outside of star - forming areas , where the smc emission is dominantly from dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field , where we can assume a proportionality between the dust emission and the smc h i column .",
    "we choose the region size of @xmath28 to be larger than the 98  beam of the h i observations and large enough to robustly determine the mean level in each box even when contaminated by point sources at the shorter wavelengths .",
    "we then subtract off the milky way cirrus contribution for those regions determined with the coefficients in table  [ tab : mwcoeff ] and the mw h i map , and , for the 70 and 160  maps , the cib level .",
    "we call this mw cirrus and cib subtracted value s@xmath29 .",
    "s@xmath30 is a combination of the zodiacal light , emission from the diffuse ism of the smc and whatever residual gradients there remain from the mosaicing for the irac maps .",
    "next , using the smc neutral h i observations of @xcite , we perform a least - squares fit to the foreground values with the following function : @xmath31 here @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the coefficients describing a plane ; @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the gradients in right ascension and declination across the smc ; @xmath37 is dust emission per h in the given waveband ; and @xmath38 is the residual emission in each box after subtracting the mw foreground and cib components . with this fit",
    "we determine the coefficients of the best fit planar foreground while excluding emission in the map coming from the smc itself .",
    "we take two additional steps to improve the determination of the planar foreground coefficients : ( 1 ) we use the 2mass point source catalog to avoid regions of high stellar density in the irac bands so we do not subtract unresolved starlight , which can masquerade as a foreground , and ( 2 ) we fix the gradient of the zodiacal light ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) at 70 and 160   to the results of the fit at 24 . since there are no mosiacing offsets for the mips bands ,",
    "the zodiacal light is by far the dominant foreground at 24  and the zodiacal light should have the same spatial dependence at all of the mips wavelengths , fixing the zodiacal light gradient to what we measure at 24  is more effective than trying to fit for those coefficients at the longer wavelengths . the fixed pattern noise at 70  and the increasingly dominant smc emission at 70 and 160",

    "thus , we take some care to make sure that the spectra we use are only those where the psf is not sampling regions outside the observed cube . for the following analysis we use",
    "only spectra where 90% of the area of the psf or more is within the observed cube , which cuts down the number of viable spectra we can extract from the cubes to 63 . the small number of resolution elements across the cube results in the introduction of scatter into the comparison between the mips and irac mosaics and the spectral maps",
    "this is the result of information from outside the cube not being `` convolved in '' .",

    "it is necessary to choose a physical model for the dust which prescribes the abundances of different grains and their size distributions . at present , a dust grain size distribution model specific to the smc including a _ variable _",
    "pah fraction and conforming to constraints on the dust mass and raw materials available has not been established , and producing such a model is complex and beyond the scope of this paper ( it would require extending the model by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "note that because we are primarily interested in the pah fraction , we must employ a model that includes a size distribution that extends into the pah regime .",
    "in addition , we aim to compare our results with other studies of the pah fraction ( particularly that on the sings sample ) which use the milky way dust model developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there is evidence that the dust grain size distributions in the smc and the milky way are different @xcite , and that low metallicity galaxies in general may have an excess of small dust grains relative to the milky way .",
    "these differences , however , should not affect our measurements of the pah fraction .",
    "@xcite found that the dust mass and pah fraction from the best fit models for the galaxies in the sings sample that fell in the range of @xmath2  covered by the lmc / smc dust models were not significantly different if the milky way model was used instead , hence they employed milky way models .",
    "given our desire to find the range of pah fractions in the smc and the benefit of being able to compare our results directly with those of @xcite , we will fit mw dust models to the photometry .",
    "we expect the choice of the mw dust models will introduce some systematic effects into the results of the model fitting .",
    "in particular , there is evidence that the smc , like other low - metallicity galaxies , has a larger contribution from small grains compared to the milky way which results in `` excess '' emission at 24 and 70 @xcite .",
    "the effect of such a population on our modeling will be to increase the best - fit radiation field in order to match the 24 and 70  brightness .",
    "since we use a power - law distribution of radiation fields , and the equilibrium emission from large grains determines the minimum radiation field , the general effect is to decrease the power - law exponent and increase u@xmath69 , making a small fraction of the dust be heated by a more intense radiation field .",
    "because the pah emission is produced by single - photon heating , @xmath2  is simply proportional to the ratio of the pah emission in the 8  band to the total far - ir emission , which is robustly constrained by the 70 and 160  photometry .",
    "hence , the derived @xmath2  is relatively insensitive to variations in the u@xmath68 , u@xmath69 and @xmath65 , provided the observed total infrared luminosity is reproduced by the models",
    ". the regions with overlapping spectroscopy will provide a good test for this reasoning , since the @xmath76  continuum in conjunction with the 24 , 70 and 160  sed provides more stringent constraints for the models .",
    "we will revisit this subject in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the models we employ only calculate contributions to the irac and mips photometry from starlight , dust continuum and dust emission features .",
    "however , the emission spectrum from the ism of the smc is likely to contain a number of emission lines , particularly from h ii regions , that contaminate the photometry .",
    "most of these lines are very weak with respect to the dust continuum except in the case of the brackett @xmath65 hydrogen recombination line at 4.05 .",
    "recent work by @xcite has shown that low - metallicity dwarf galaxies with recent star formation can have a br@xmath65 contribution that is a significant fraction of their integrated 4.5  flux .",
    "this problem is exacerbated within the h ii regions themselves , where the 4.5  emission can be almost entirely from br@xmath65 ( see for instance work on m 17 by * ? ? ?",
    "the sed models contain starlight continuum with a fixed 3.6 to 4.5  ratio",
    ". if there is excess 4.5  emission due to the hydrogen line , the starlight continuum will be too high , altering the ratio of stellar to non - stellar emission at 5.8 and 8.0 . to correct for the br@xmath65 emission",
    ", we use the magellanic cloud emission line survey image of h@xmath65 ( kindly provided by c. smith and f. winkler ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along with the case b factors at 10,000 k from @xcite to convert h@xmath65 to br@xmath65",
    ". this correction will underestimate the br@xmath65 emission where there is extinction , but since the intrinsic extinction in the smc is low to begin with we expect this estimate of br@xmath65 to be adequate .",
    "this br@xmath65 correction is highest in h ii regions , where we find br@xmath65 emission can account for 20 - 30% of the total 4.5 emission . outside of h ii regions ,",
    "the correction is negligible .",
    "@xcite investigated the integrated far - ir sed of the smc , using observations from iras , iso , dirbe and tophat .",
    "they found that the mips 160  photometry is high by approximately 25% compared to the values predicted by interpolating from the dirbe observations at 140 and 240 , a significant offset given how close in wavelength the dirbe 140 and mips 160 bands are .",
    "more recent mips observations of the smc obtained through the sage - smc legacy survey ( gordon et al 2010 , in prep . ) agree very well with the s@xmath0mc photometry , suggesting that this offset is real .",
    "the source of this offset is not known , it may be partly due to a calibration difference between the instruments or to [ c ii ] 158  emission contributing in the mips bandpass . in their analysis",
    ", @xcite divided the s@xmath0mc map by a factor of 1.25 .",
    "we do not use this factor in our analysis .",
    "dividing the 160  photometry by 1.25 would produce a lower pah fraction from our analysis because the 70/160  ratio would increase , the radiation field needed for the large grains to acheive the necessary temperature would be higher and , given the emission at 8 , the pah fraction necessary will be lower .    if the contribution of the [ c ii ] line is significant , there may be a systematic offset in the pah fraction we determine .",
    "@xcite find that [ c ii ] and 8  emission are correlated in the lmc .",
    "if regions of the smc with 8  emission have significant [ c ii ] emission in the 160  band , we will systematically overestimate the pah fraction , since it will seem that the large grains are colder than they really are .",
    "future herschel observations of the [ c ii ] line in the smc will help to understand what the level of contamination of the 160  observation .      in the following ,",
    "we use the s@xmath1mc data is to investigate the reliability of the determination of @xmath2  from seds alone ( i.e. photofit ) .",
    "the photospectrofit model fitting procedure is very similar to the sed fits , and involves searching the same grid of models for the best fit .    in using sed fits to measure the pah fraction",
    ", we must assume that the irac 8.0  band , which samples the 7.7  pah feature , traces the total pah emission .",
    "this has been seen to be a good assumption when looking at the integrated spectra of galaxies @xcite , but variations in the relative band strengths can be averaged out on galaxy - scales and the 7.7  feature may not trace the total pah emission as effectively within individual star - forming regions . the simultaneous sed and spectral coverage provided by s@xmath0mc and s@xmath1mc allow us to test the effectiveness of sed fits to determine @xmath2 , since the photofit results will be solely determined by the 7.7 feature , while the photospectrofit results will , to first - order , match the total pah emission in the mid - ir .",
    "the photospectrofit models will only reproduce to total pah emission to first order because the models use fixed spectral profiles for the various pah bands , and a fixed pah ionization fraction .",
    "there are variations in the pah bands observed in the smc which are not reproduced in detail by the models . however , fitting the full mid - ir spectrum in the s@xmath1mc regions will approximately reproduce the total pah emission in all of the major mid - ir bands , and therefore be a better tracer than the 7.7 feature alone . although the comparison between the photofit and photospectrofit results is not the ideal way to quantify the dependence of @xmath2  on the band ratios , it is the best that can currently be done without further modeling which is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "prior to fitting the irs spectroscopy , we remove the emission lines from the spectrum using the pahfit spectral fitting package @xcite .",
    "we also use the pahfit results to estimate the uncertainties in the spectra employing the following procedure .",
    "the irs pipeline produces uncertainties based on the slope fits to individual ramps and propagates these through the various reduction steps .",
    "these errors do not include any systematic effects , and underestimate the scatter in our spectra significantly .",
    "in addition , the assumption that the uncertainties are random , uniform and uncorrelated for propagation through our analysis does not apply : striping in the spectral cube does not average out spatially or spectrally . to get a better idea of the uncertainties , we estimate the average deviation of the spectrum from the best pahfit result in a 5 pixel - wide sliding window .",
    "although this technique may artificially increase the uncertainties in regions that are poorly fit by pahfit , we find that uncertainties estimated in this manner are much more reasonable than those propagated from the pipeline . finally , because the number of points associated with the spectrum is much larger than the seds it was necessary to artificially increase the weight of the sed points to achieve a decent fit .",
    "we find that applying weighting factors of 40 to all the photometric points yield reasonable joint fits .",
    "figure  [ fig : photvspec ] shows the values of @xmath2  for the best fit models in the regions with overlapping photometry and spectroscopy . because of the gridded nature of the models , there are typically a number of points overlapping in the plot , so we additionally show a histogram of the values on either axis .",
    "the majority of points in our spectral map regions have @xmath2  at the lower limit of the range and the majority of those points yield the same value of @xmath2  from the photofit and photospectrofit results . at the high end of the range of @xmath2",
    ", we also see good consistency between the photofit and photospectrofit values . in the intermediate regions ,",
    "the photofit models tend to underestimate @xmath2  by a small amount . excluding all of the points having the minimum pah fraction , the photospectrofit @xmath2  value is , on average , larger than the photofit value by only @xmath77@xmath2@xmath78% .    despite the good agreement between the photofit and photospectrofit @xmath2 ,",
    "the best fit models in the two cases show striking systematic differences .",
    "figure  [ fig : photvspecmod ] shows a comparison of a few of the photofit and photospectrofit models , chosen to highlight the range of @xmath2  we measure from the spectra .",
    "table  [ tab : plotparams ] shows the best fit radiation field parameters for the plotted seds and spectra . in all cases",
    ", the spectroscopic information shows that the mid - ir continuum below the pah features is lower than the photofit model predicts .",
    "the differences arise because the photofit models have the observed sed unconstrained over the factor of @xmath79 gaps in wavelength between 8 and 24  and between 24 and 70 , whereas the photospectrofit models add continuous constraints on the sed from 5 to 38 .",
    "the photofit models tend to overpredict the continuum between 8 and 24 , and to underpredict the continuum between 24 and 70 , using @xmath65 values that are too small , and leading to overestimation of @xmath71 .",
    "the overprediction of the @xmath80  continuum leads to underprediction of @xmath2 , but as seen in figure  [ fig : photvspec ] , the bias is not large , amounting to @xmath77@xmath2@xmath78% , although in some cases the errors are larger . in general the dust surface density and stellar luminosity are not changed in a systematic way .",
    "what this amounts to is a redistribution of the radiation field to increase the fraction of dust that is being heated by very high radiation fields and to decrease the radiation field necessary in the diffuse ism .",
    "in fact , the average radiation field in the photofit and photospectrofit models is similar .",
    "we show a series of plots illustrating these changes in figures  [ fig : photvspecall ] and  [ fig : photvspecfpdr ] .",

    "there are a number of regions where 8  emission is very bright while the pah fraction is low .",

    "this may indicate that the radiation field in these regions is affecting both co and pahs .",
    "we have so far shown that pah fraction is high in regions of active star - formation , associated with the presence of co and molecular gas .",

    "@xcite determined the pah fraction in the sings galaxy sample using identical techniques to what we have done here .",
    "they observed a effect very similar to what was seen by @xcite in that at a metallicity of @xmath121 log(o / h ) @xmath122 there is an abrupt change in the typical pah fraction or 8/24  ratio .",
    "the smc lies right at this transition metallicity , so we hope to gain some insight into the processes at work by studying its pah fraction . there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how pahs form and how they are destroyed , let alone how those processes balance in the ism .",
    "in the following sections we address some of the proposed aspects of the pah life - cycle and elucidate what we can learn about them from the smc .",
    "the formation of pahs in the atmospheres of evolved stars is a well established hypothesis for the source of interstellar pahs .",
    "pah emission bands have been observed in the spectrum of the carbon - rich post - agb stars where the radiation field increases in hardness and intensity , more effectively exciting the pah emission features @xcite . despite these observations of pah formation in carbon - rich stars , it remains to be shown that they inject pahs into the ism at the level needed to explain the abundance observed .",
    "this , of course , is a general problem in the `` stardust '' scenario @xcite .",
    "recently , in the large magellanic cloud , @xcite have performed a detailed accounting of the dust enrichment of the ism by agb stars and find a significant deficit compared to the observed ism dust mass .",
    "assuming that the `` stardust '' picture is correct , @xcite and @xcite hypothesize that the low fraction of pahs in low metallicity galaxies reflects the delay ( @xmath123 myr ) in the production of carbon dust from agb stars relative to silicate dust from core - collapse supernova .",
    "for the smc in particular , this picture has a number of issues .",
    "most importantly , there is evidence that the smc formed a large fraction of its stars more than 8 gyr ago followed by a subsequent burst of star formation 3 gyr ago @xcite .",
    "this long time scale makes the delayed pah injection into the ism by agb stars an unlikely explanation for the current observed pah deficiency .",
    "recent work by @xcite , for example , argues that carbon - rich agb stars in low metallicity galaxies can start contributing dust to the ism in @xmath124 myr .    to evaluate the relationship between the current distribution of pahs and the input of pahs from agb stars , we show in figure  [ fig : cstar ] the pah fracion overlayed with contours of the density of carbon agb stars .",
    "these contours are created using the 2mass 6x point source catalog towards the smc , selecting carbon stars using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "the distribution of carbon stars follows the observed `` spheroidal '' population of older stars in the smc very well @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2map , however , has no clear relationship to the distribution of carbon stars .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected since the distribution of ism mass does not follow the stellar component either . however , we note that a different conclusion regarding the pah fracion compared to the distribution of agb stars was recently reached by @xcite , who modeled dust seds across the large magellanic cloud using the sed models of @xcite .",
    "they find evidence that the fracion of pahs in the lmc is highest in the region of the stellar bar , where the concentration of agb stars peaks .",
    "this could be an accidental coincidence , or it may reflect methodological differences or it could indicate a different dominant mechanism of pah formation in the smc and lmc or more efficient destruction of pahs in the smc .        although the distribution of pahs may not resemble that of agb stars , we would expect the pahs injected by those stars to be present in the diffuse ism and not preferentially in molecular clouds .",
    "as we have shown , however , the diffuse ism pah content is very low in the smc . as such , in order to reconcile the pathway of pahs from agb stars to the diffuse ism to molecular clouds , we must hypothesize a recent event , occuring after the condensation of the current generation of molecular clouds , which essentially cleared the diffuse ism of agb - produced pahs while leaving the shielded regions of molecular gas with high pah fractions . observations of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the magellanic clouds and other nearby galaxies suggest that the gmc lifetime is @xmath125 myr @xcite , so the event in question would have had to occur within the last 25 myr or so . in the absence of such an event ( which we will investigate further in a section  [ sec : uv ] ) , our observation of low pah fraction in the diffuse ism , higher pah fraction in molecular clouds , and the lack of relation between the pah fraction and the distribution of agb stars is strong evidence against agb stars being the dominant force behind the fraction of pahs in the smc .",
    "the shocks created by supernova explosions have a dramatic effect on the content and size distribution of dust in the interstellar medium . upon encountering a shock wave ,",
    "grains can be shattered via collisions or sputtered by hot gas behind the shock or by motion of the grain through the post - shock medium .",
    "because of their small mass - to - area ratio , pahs are well coupled to the gas and do not acquire large relative velocities after the passage of a shock , so they will primarily be sputtered only in hot post - shock gas behind fast ( @xmath126 km s@xmath15 ) shocks .",
    "calculations by @xcite suggest that grain shattering could in fact be a net source of pah material for shocks between 50 and 200 km s@xmath15 , converting @xmath13% of the initial grain mass into small pah sized fragments .",
    "thus , it is not immediately obvious what the net effect of interstellar shocks on the fraction of pahs will be .",
    "some studies attribute the low pah fraction in low metallicity galaxies to efficient destruction of pahs by supernova shocks .",
    "@xcite found a correlation between decreasing pah emission and increased supernova activity as traced by the ratio of mid - ir lines of [ fe ii ] and [ ne ii ] .",
    "two issues with this interpretation are that the mid - ir lines are tracing current supernova activity , which only affects the pah fraction in the immediate vicinity of those remnants , and an increased supernova rate will have recently been related to a higher uv field produced by the massive stars , so it is difficult to disentangle the effects of shocks versus intense uv fields .",
    "the distinctive nature of the smc extinction curve might point toward the influence of supernova shocks on the dust grain size distribution .",
    "four of the five extinction curves show similar characteristics : a lack of the 2175   bump ( the carrier of which is most likely pahs * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a steeper far - uv rise indicating more small dust grains relative to the milky way extinction curve @xcite .",
    "magellanic - type extinction has been seen to arise in the milky way as well along the sightline towards hd 204827 , which may be embedded in dust associated with a supernova shock @xcite . however , there are many other viable interpretations to explain the proportion of small dust grains , including inhibition of grain growth in dense clouds .    in figure",
    "[ fig : shocks ] we show a map of the h i velocity dispersion in the smc from @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion here mostly traces the regions where there are more than one velocity component along the line of sight , particularly highlighting the regions where @xcite find evidence for supergiant shells in the h i distribution .",
    "we show the approximate locations of two of their shells that overlap our map .",
    "if supernovae are the source of these shells , @xcite find that @xmath127 supernovae are required to account for the kinetic energy and the shells have dynamical ages of @xmath128 myr .",
    "the supergiant shells provide indirect evidence for the effects of supernovae on the ism . on figure",
    "[ fig : shocks ] we also mark with green crosses the locations of young ( @xmath129 yr ) supernova remnants identified in the australia telescope compact array survey of the smc @xcite .",
    "there is no clear trend relating @xmath2  to the boundaries of the supergiant shells , although this may be an effect of depth along the the line of sight .",
    "the middle region of the bar and wing , which is essentially devoid of pahs is covered by one of the shells , but the sw bar , which hosts the largest concentration of pahs in the smc is covered as well . although there is an anticorrelation between the young snrs and large pah fraction , the distribution of remnants closely follows that of the massive star - forming regions ( compare figures  [ fig : hacomp ] and  [ fig : shocks ] ) .",
    "for this reason , it is difficult to draw strong conclusions as to whether the supernova shocks or the uv fields and h ii regions created by their progenitor stars were responsible for destroying pahs in these areas .",
    "similar to shocks , regions of high turbulent velocity may alter the size distribution of dust grains via shattering .",
    "@xcite studied a region of high latitude cirrus and argued that variations in small dust grain and pah fractions could be related to the turbulent velocity field in the region .",
    "@xcite have studied turbulence in the ism of the smc using the h i observations of @xcite .",
    "they present a map showing an estimate of the sonic mach number of turbulence in the smc based on higher order moments of h i column density and the results of numerical simulations .",
    "this map is quite distinct from the velocity dispersion map shown in figure  [ fig : shocks ] which mostly highlights the presence of bulk velocity motions along the line of sight . in figure",
    "[ fig : turb ] we show the @xcite mach number map overlayed with the contours of @xmath2 .",
    "we find that there is no strong correlation between tubulent mach number and @xmath2 , although in general the regions of high @xmath2  are near depressions in the mach number distribution , opposite what we would expect if grain shattering in turbulence was a major source of pahs .",
    "however , this simple comparison does not provide information about the amount of dust affected by different levels of turbulence ( e.g. some of the low mach number regions may represent a very small fraction of the total ism ) . to account for this fact , we also calculate the dust mass surface density weighted mach number in regions with @xmath2@xmath130% and @xmath131% to be @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "although there is no clear association between high sonic mach number and @xmath2  from this comparison , it is worth noting that if pahs are primarily associated with molecular gas , the mach number derived from h i observations may have little relevance to the creation or destruction of pahs in the smc .        in general",
    ", we do not see clear cut evidence that turbulence or shocks are the major drivers of the pah fraction in the smc .",
    "young snrs are found around h ii regions , making it difficult to separate the effects of radiation field and shocks in the destruction of pahs in those regions .",
    "the supergiant h i shells observed in the smc may be a tracer of where supernova shocks have seriously affected the ism , but we see peaks of @xmath2  within their boundaries barring a line - of - sight depth effect .      in low metallicity galaxies ,",
    "the dust to gas ratio is decreased @xcite and the effects of the uv field from regions of massive star formation can be spread over a much larger area .",
    "in addition , the decreased metallicity may lead to harder uv fields because of the lower line blanketing in stellar atmospheres .",
    "these changes can be traced by the ratios of mid - ir emission lines and work by @xcite and others have shown that radiation fields are harder in low metallicity environments .",
    "@xcite studied star - forming regions in m 101 , over a range of excitation conditions and metallicities .",
    "they found that the strength of pah emission decreases with increasing ionization parameter , suggesting that processing by the uv field from these regions was the major force behind the changing pah fraction .",
    "the exact mechanism of pah destruction by uv fields is not entirely clear .",
    "small pahs can be destroyed by the ejection of an acetylene group upon absorbing a uv photon @xcite , but pahs larger than @xmath98 carbon atoms are relatively stable to these effects under a range of uv field conditions .",
    "if the pahs are partially dehydrogentated or highly ionized , they are more susceptible to destruction @xcite , so one possibility is that pahs in low metallicity galaxies tend to be more highly ionized , dehydrogenated or smaller than their counterparts in higher metallicity galaxies .",
    "however , there is little evidence from the spectra of low metallicity galaxies @xcite that pahs are different at low metallicity .",
    "there is also a distinction to be made between the destruction of pahs by intense radiation fields in the immediate vicinity of h ii regions and a global decrease of the pah fraction in the galaxy .",
    "we see evidence for pah destruction near h ii regions in our map ( see figure  [ fig : hacomp ] ) . but can uv fields from massive star forming regions be responsible for the low @xmath2  over the entire galaxy ?",
    "there is evidence that star - forming regions in irregular galaxies can `` leak '' a large fraction of their ionizing photons .",
    "observations of emission line ratios from the diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) in star - forming dwarfs indicate that dilution of radiation from a central massive star - forming region which leaks a significant fraction of its ionizing photons is a likely source for the dig @xcite . in the smc ,",
    "models of n 66 suggest that @xmath94 45% of the ionizing photons escape the h ii region and go on to ionize the diffuse ism @xcite .",
    "thus , it is at least plausible that uv fields may be an important driver of pah destruction over the entire galaxy .    to evaluate the possibility that the low @xmath2  in the smc is due to destruction by uv fields , we examine the resolved star - formation history of @xcite to search for recent star - forming events that could have affected the pah fraction in the diffuse ism through their uv fields . in figure  [ fig : sfh ]",
    "we show five panels illustrating the @xcite results regridded to match our map of @xmath2 .",
    "these panels show the total star formation rate for bins older than 1 gyr , from 400 myr to 1 gyr ago , from 100 to 400 myr ago , from 25 to 100 myr ago and younger than 25 myr",
    ".        in general , panels which show the star - formation rate in bins older than 100 myr tend to follow the spheroidal distribution of older stars , as traced by the carbon stars shown in figure  [ fig : cstar ] .",
    "the @xmath134 myr panel shows that star formation occurred along the bar , coinciding with the region in our @xmath2  map that is devoid of pahs .",
    "the most recent star formation , which would overlap the time when the current generation of molecular clouds condensed , seems to be mainly associated with the outermost edges of the bar , near where we see pahs .",
    "pah destruction as a side effect of massive star formation is difficult to disentangle since the uv fields and subsequent supernovae only affect the dust over a short period of time surrounding the star formation event . between 25 and 100 myr ago in the smc , the star - formation along the bar , which most likely relates to the supergiant bubble seen in the h i overlapping that location , may have cleared the region of pahs by some combination of uv fields and shocks .",
    "however , most of this activity likely occured before the condensation of the molecular clouds ( @xmath125 myr @xmath135 ago ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that currently have a high pah fraction , so there is still difficulty in reconciling the high @xmath2 in molecular clouds and the low @xmath2  in the diffuse ism by destruction alone .",
    "one of our primary observations in the smc is that high pah fractions occur along lines of sight through molecular gas .",
    "we argue that such a situation could arise in two scenarios : 1 ) agb stars enrich the diffuse ism with pahs , part of which is then incorporated into molecular clouds . a subsequent event ( e.g. sn )",
    "clears the pahs in the diffuse ism . or , 2 ) pah formation occurs in the molecular clouds",
    ". these two scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",
    "@xcite found enhanced pah fraction in the lmc both in the stellar bar , which hosts the highest concentration of agb stars , and in molecular clouds .",
    "it is possible that in the diffuse ism of the smc , agb produced pahs are rapidly destroyed and all we observe are pahs that formed in molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite propose a scenario by which pahs could be formed in dense clouds .",
    "they argue that a layer of ices and organic material forms on grains in dense clouds and the photoprocessing which occurs in the transition from the dense cloud back to the diffuse ism forms pahs , a phenomenon they explore through laboratory experimentation .",
    "there is also observational evidence that hints at some of the processing pahs undergo in dense clouds . @xcite and @xcite show variations in the pah spectrum in photo - dissociation regions consistent with pahs being in clusters or embedded in a carbonaceous matrix in the surrounding molecular gas and emerging as free - flying pahs closer to the exciting star .    while it would not be out of question that a burst of star - formation @xmath125 myr ago could have a dramatic effect on the global diffuse ism of the smc , a more likely scenario for the concentration of pahs in molecular clouds",
    "is that they form there . assuming that is the case there are a number of interesting observations that we can make about the formation of pahs in molecular clouds in the smc .",
    "first , the correspondence between the co and @xmath2  is very good , better even then the correspondence between the pahs and the bolatto et al 2009 ( in prep ) map of molecular hydrogen inferred from excess dust emission .",
    "this suggests that the conditions for the formation of co and the formation of pahs are similar .",
    "it may be that the uv field in the outskirts of the clouds , where h@xmath104 can self - shield but co is dissociated , can disrupt the growth of mantles on the grains , preventing a process that creates pahs .",
    "alternatively , because the growth of mantles requires relatively high densities , the presence of co may allow the gas to cool and become denser , increasing the rate of gas - grain reactions .",
    "this scenario could be tested by comparing the distribution of co and pahs in a sample of irregular galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that co in the n 83 region of the smc is found where a@xmath136 through the cloud ( a@xmath137 at cloud center ) .",
    "if co survives and pahs form at a similar extinction , the decrease in the pah fraction and the deficit of co emission at low metallicity may be related to the scarcity of regions where this condition is met .",
    "second , we observe that the typical @xmath2  in smc molecular clouds is @xmath3% . this is lower than the average milky way value ( which is for the diffuse ism ) and may represent some limit on the efficiency of creating pahs in molecular gas in the smc . in the low metallicity galaxies studied by @xcite , those with metallicities below @xmath121 log(o / h ) @xmath7 had a median pah @xmath2  of 1% with large scatter .",
    "this scatter could be due to the filling factor of molecular gas .",
    "if pahs are forming primarily in molecular clouds , the differences observed in the pah fraction in low versus high metallicity galaxies may be related to the ability of pahs to survive and accumulate in the diffuse ism and/or to the efficiency of pah formation in molecular gas , which can be decreased by the lower carbon abundance and the more pervasive uv fields in low metallicity environments .",
    "finally , in the scenario where pahs are destroyed in the diffuse ism and formed in molecular clouds and agb stars , the abrupt transition at a metallicity of @xmath121 log(o / h ) @xmath7 would represent mostly a change in the efficiency of pah destruction in the diffuse ism .",
    "if pahs are destroyed efficiently in the diffuse ism of these systems , all that is left are the pahs created in molecular clouds",
    ". a resolved study of the pah abundance in the sings galaxies using higher resolution far - ir and millimeter - wave co observations from herschel may be able to show whether the pah fraction in the diffuse ism versus molecular clouds is changing across the transition metallicity .",
    "we present results of fitting the @xcite dust models to seds and spectra obtained from s@xmath0mc and s@xmath1mc .",
    "our major results are as follows :    1 .",
    "comparisons of best - fit dust models in regions with overlapping photometry and spectroscopy demonstrate that the irac and mips sed estimator for @xmath2  does not appear to be appreciably biased despite the absence of information between @xmath80 and @xmath138 . when @xmath76  irs spectroscopy is added to the fitting constraints , the resulting `` photospectrofit '' models yield @xmath2  values that are only slightly larger than the `` photofit '' model estimates .",
    "the photospectrofit models have more dust at intermediate ( t @xmath139k ) temperatures , and less dust with t @xmath140 k. the estimate for the average radiation intensity scale factor @xmath73 and the dust surface density m@xmath66 are nearly unaffected .",
    "the pah fraction in the smc is low and variable . as a fraction of the total dust mass , the highest pah fractions we observe are about half of the milky way value , but most of the galaxy has pah fractions at the lower limit of our models ( @xmath2= @xmath141% ) , an order of magnitude lower than the milky way value .",
    "the average @xmath4@xmath2@xmath142% in the smc .",
    "this is consistent with the earlier estimate of a very low pah fraction in the smc @xcite based on iras and dirbe photometry .",
    "3 .   the 8  emission alone does not trace the @xmath2  well in the smc .",
    "we find that the 8/24 ratio is correlated with @xmath2 and agrees with what one would predict from the metallicity of the smc and the observed trends in @xcite , but for a given @xmath2  there is a wide range of 8/24 ratios , depending on the intensity of the local starlight heating the grains .",
    "the metallicity of the smc places it at the transition where lower metallicity galaxies show a deficiency of pahs and higher metallicity galaxies show approximately milky way level pah fractions .",
    "if the smc is typical of galaxies in this region , the transition seems to represent a decrease in the filling factor of pah - rich regions rather than a uniform decrease in the pah fraction throughout the galaxy , although even the highest pah fractions are still well below mw levels .",
    "lines - of - sight with molecular gas have an average @xmath2  of @xmath11% , while lines of sight through the diffuse ism have @xmath2  at least a factor of two less .",
    "we evaluate the various proposed drivers of the deficit of pahs at low metallicity .",
    "the distribution of pahs in the smc does not follow the carbon agb star distribution , the regions of high turbulent mach number , or the location of supergiant shells in the ism . 7 .",
    "the low pah fraction in the diffuse ism versus the high pah fraction in molecular regions leads us to propose that pahs may be forming in molecular clouds and/or a recent event ( perhaps related to star formation events in the last @xmath94 25 myr ) destroyed a large fraction of the pahs in the diffuse ism .",
    "we surmise that the global pah fraction at low metallicities is a reflection of the amount of gas in these systems that is found at high extinction ( a@xmath137 ) .",

    "because we combine photometry and spectroscopy in our model fitting , we investigated whether there were systematic differences between the calibrations of the irs and mips / irac instruments .",
    "the ssc finds the cross - calibration agrees to within 10% for the three instruments .",
    "however , most of these tests have been carried out on stellar sources , whereas our observations are primarily concerned with extended emission .",
    "we have used the extended source corrections for irac determined by @xcite and the slit loss correction function for irs distributed with cubism .",
    "we have constructed 8 and 24  maps from the spectral cubes using the most recent versions of the spectral response curves available from the ssc ( for irac ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we then compare the irs 8 and 24  maps to the same regions in the irac and mips mosaic after smoothing to eliminate any small psf differences between the two instruments .",
    "calibration differences between the instruments present themselves as a non - unity slope in the comparison of irs 24  to mips 24  and irs 8  to irac 8 .",
    "for the 8  comparison , we find that the irs photometry is higher than the irac photometry by factor of 1.1 , on average , although the slope in individual regions varies between 1.04 to 1.14 . at 24",
    "the irs photometry is lower than the mips photometry by a factor of 0.94 on average , varying between 0.91 and 0.96 region to region . individually , these differences are within the quoted cross - calibration limits stated by the ssc , however without correction they introduce scatter in the comparison of spectroscopically and photometrically determined @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the slope , there is an additive offset between the irs and mips / irac photometry that is too large to be an issue with the mips / irac mosaic foreground subtraction described previously ( additive offsets are @xmath143 mjy sr@xmath15 at 24  and @xmath144 mjy sr@xmath15 at 8 ) .",
    "the source of this additive offset is not definitively known , but we consider it very likely that it results from slight under or over subtraction of the zodiacal light foreground as determined by spot for the irs cubes .",
    "the uncertainties of the dirbe model are on the order of a few percent at the dirbe wavelengths , and particularly at 24  where the zodiacal foreground is very bright ( on the order of tens of mjy sr@xmath15 ) and a few percent error easily translates into offsets on the order of a few tenths of a mjy sr@xmath15 . in order to eliminate these offsets , we must make some assumption about the spectral shape of the correction .",
    "to do this we fix the `` off '' position zodiacal spectrum and determine the percentage by which the `` map '' position spectrum must be off to produce the offsets we observe .",
    "we do this for each aor in the dataset and then add in the resulting correction spectrum .",
    "the correction is less than 5% in all cases .",
    "the multiplicative differences in the calibration between irs and mips most likely result from the extended source calibration in irs , since mips does not require such a correction . for the irac",
    "/ irs match - up , the source is not obvious , since both instruments require an extended source correction factor .",
    "a further consideration in our work is that we must apply a correction factor consistently across either all of the irs or all of the irac data , since we only have overlapping information in a few regions , but we aim to determine the pah fractions over the whole s@xmath0mc map .",
    "there is no obvious way to decide which to correct , the irs or irac calibration , so we choose the simplest route : we apply corrections to the irs spectra based on the factors necessary to match irac 8  and mips 24 .",
    "we determine a correction factor that depends linearly on wavelength which matches the photometric to spectroscopic points in each region .",

    "<S> we present the results of modeling dust spectral energy distributions ( seds ) across the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) with the aim of mapping the distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in a low - metallicity environment . using _ spitzer _ </S>",
    "<S> survey of the smc ( s@xmath0mc ) photometry from 3.6 to 160  over the main star - forming regions of the wing and bar of the smc along with spectral mapping observations from 5 to 38  from the _ spitzer _ spectroscopic survey of the small magellanic cloud ( s@xmath1mc ) in selected regions , we model the dust spectral energy distribution and emission spectrum to determine the fraction of dust in pahs across the smc . </S>",
    "<S> we use the regions of overlaping photometry and spectroscopy to test the reliability of the pah fraction as determined from sed fits alone . </S>",
    "<S> the pah fraction in the smc is low compared to the milky way and variable  with relatively high fractions ( @xmath2@xmath3% ) in molecular clouds and low fractions in the diffuse ism ( average @xmath4@xmath2@xmath5% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use the map of pah fraction across the smc to test a number of ideas regarding the production , destruction and processing of pahs in the ism . </S>",
    "<S> we find weak or no correlation between the pah fraction and the distribution of carbon agb stars , the location of supergiant h i shells and young supernova remnants , and the turbulent mach number . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pah fraction is correlated with co intensity , peaks in the dust surface density and the molecular gas surface density as determined from 160  emission . </S>",
    "<S> the pah fraction is high in regions of active star - formation , as predicted by its correlation with molecular gas , but is supressed in h ii regions . because the pah fraction in the diffuse ism is generally very low  in accordance with previous work on modeling the integrated sed of the smc  and </S>",
    "<S> the pah fraction is relatively high in molecular regions , we suggest that pahs are destroyed in the diffuse ism of the smc and/or pahs are forming in molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these observations for our understanding of the pah life cycle , particularly in low - metallicity and/or primordial galaxies . </S>"
