    "the casimir effect is one of the most interesting manifestations of the nontrivial structure of the vacuum state in quantum field theory .",
    "this effect appears when nontrivial boundary conditions or background fields are present ( _ e.g. _ solitons ) . in 1948",
    "casimir predicted the existence of this effect as an attractive force between two infinite parallel uncharged perfectly conducting plates in vacuum @xcite ( for a general review on the casimir effect , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "this effect was subsequently observed experimentally by sparnaay in 1958 @xcite . up to now",
    ", most experiments on the measurement of the casimir forces have been performed with parallel plates@xcite or with a sphere in front of a plane@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the configuration of two eccentric cylinders have both experimental and theoretical interest@xcite . the majority of the investigations related to the casimir effect concern the calculation of this energy or the resulting forces for different fields in different geometries with different boundary conditions imposed@xcite .",
    "these cases include parallel plates@xcite , cubes@xcite , cylinders@xcite , and spherical geometries@xcite .",
    "this effect has even been investigated in connection with the properties of the space - time with extra dimensions@xcite , and nowadays it is known that the casimir energy depends strongly on the geometry of the space - time and on the boundary conditions imposed@xcite .",
    "in fact , an interesting question is the determination of the conditions under which the forces acting on the boundaries for closed geometries are attractive or repulsive in arbitrary spatial dimensions@xcite .",
    "the casimir effect has many applications in different branches of physics .",
    "perhaps the first extensive study of the casimir effect was in particle physics and in connection with the development of the bag model of hadrons@xcite .",
    "one of the most fascinating and open problems of theoretical physics is the cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "this constant is also a candidate for the dark energy@xcite , and the casimir energy has been studied in this connection@xcite .",
    "moreover , the presence of the casimir forces in many different phenomena of condensed matter and laser physics have been established both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . in particular , the study of the casimir effect for massless scalar fields is not only of theoretical interest but also has direct relevance to physical systems such as bose - einstein condensates@xcite .",
    "calculations of the casimir energy in spherically symmetric configurations have attracted the interest of physicists for many years@xcite .",
    "as boyer@xcite first showed , the casimir pressure exerted by the electromagnetic(em ) field on the walls of a perfectly conducting spherical vessel is repulsive ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "the reported casimir energy and pressure of a scalar field confined in a spherical vessel with dirichlet boundary condition is also reported to be positive@xcite .",
    "comparison between the reported values of the casimir energy for closed geometries show that these values depend crucially on three major factors : first the details of the geometries ( e.g. spheres or cubes ) , second the number of space dimensions , and third the boundary conditions .",
    "to be very concrete we have collected all of the reported results for various cases and display them in table([tab.compare . ] ) .",
    "we should mention that all of the results obtained for cubical geometry are exact , while the ones for spherical geometries are obtained approximately by various numerical methods .",

    "finally , the radii of all the spheres except the original one go to infinity .",
    "our result shows that the casimir energy for a massless scalar field in a cube and a sphere have indeed opposite signs , contrary to the case of the em field . as mentioned in the introduction , and",

    "<S> in this paper we compute the leading order of the casimir energy for a free massless scalar field confined in a sphere in three spatial dimensions , with the dirichlet boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> when one tabulates all of the reported values of the casimir energies for two closed geometries , cubical and spherical , in different space - time dimensions and with different boundary conditions , one observes a complicated pattern of signs . </S>",
    "<S> this pattern shows that the casimir energy depends crucially on the details of the geometry , the number of the spatial dimensions , and the boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the _ sign _ of the casimir energy on the details of the geometry , for a fixed spatial dimensions and boundary conditions has been a surprise to us and this is our main motivation for doing the calculations presented in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , all of the calculations for spherical geometries include the use of numerical methods combined with intricate analytic continuations to handle many different sorts of divergences which naturally appear in this category of problems . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of divergences is always a source of concern about the accuracy of the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> our approach also includes numerical methods , and is based on boyer s method for calculating the electromagnetic casimir energy in a perfectly conducting sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this method , however , requires the least amount of analytic continuations . </S>",
    "<S> the value that we obtain confirms the previously established result . </S>"
