    "a couple of decades ago it was found that radio emission is observed by about three times more often from double galaxies and members of groups of galaxies than from single , isolated galaxies ( tovmassian @xcite ; sulentic @xcite ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that galactic nuclear activity , one of the manifestations of which is a radio emission , is a result of interaction between galaxies . events of interaction should take place much more often in dense environments of compact groups ( cgs ) of galaxies .",
    "therefore it was expected that some of member galaxies in cgs should be relatively strong radio emitters .",
    "the first systematic search for radio emission from hickson compact groups ( hcgs ) , revealed a radio emission at 18 cm above a flux limit of 1.5 mjy from 41 out of 88 observed member galaxies ( menon & hickson @xcite ) .",
    "it was found ( tovmassian & shahbazian @xcite ) that in groups of galaxies the radio emission is most often observed from the optically first - ranked galaxies .",
    "menon ( @xcite ) showed that the radio emission in hcgs is almost always associated with the first - ranked _ elliptical _",
    "galaxies , while the radio detected _ spirals _ are uniformly distributed among the three brightest members of a group .",
    "prior to hcgs the lists of the so called shakhbasian compact groups of compact galaxies ( scgcgs ) were published ( shakhbazian @xcite , baier & tiersch @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is the largest and a relatively homogeneous sample of galaxy groups known up to now .",
    "shakhbazian s cgs were found on the poss prints by an eye search .",
    "they were identified according to the following criteria :    - the groups consist of 5 - 15 members ;    - the apparent magnitude of the individual galaxies is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ;    - the groups are compact , i.e. the distances between galaxies are only 3 - 5 times the diameters of galaxies ;    - nearly all member galaxies are extremly red , at most 1 - 2 blue galaxies in a group is an exception ;    - members of groups are compact ( relatively high surface brightness , borders not diffuse ) ;    - the groups are isolated .",
    "shcgs originally were called compact groups of _ compact _ galaxies , because the images of most of the constituent galaxies in these groups seemed very compact .",
    "later observations of these groups with high angular resolution revealed that member galaxies mostly are of e and s0 types .",
    "the fraction of early type galaxies is 77% in scgs compared to 51% in hcgs and 40% in field galaxies ( tiersch et al .",
    "member galaxies in these groups are significantly redder than the field galaxies of the same morphological type .",
    "the difference in b - v and v - r is by @xmath3 redder compared to galaxies of the rc3 .",
    "anyhow , there were found emission - line , and even seyfert galaxies among shakhbazian groups members .",
    "since , as it was found out , members of shakhbazian groups turned to be not `` compact '' , these groups in recent papers were called shakhbazian compact groups of galaxies ( scggs ) ( tovmassian et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter tmtst , @xcite ) , or in analogy with hcgs , - shakhbazian compact groups ( shcgs ) ( tovmassian et al .",
    "@xcite ) . galaxies in shcgs are relatively weak , because they are at least by three times further than hcgs ( tmtst ) .",
    "mainly for this reason , and probably for very unusual supposed composition the shcgs attracted little attention until recently .",
    "the redshifts of only about 70 relatively bright and nearby shcgs have been measured so far ( robinson & wampler @xcite ; arp et al .",
    "@xcite ; mirzoyan et al .",

    "@xcite ) .",
    "the densities of galaxies in shcgs approaches to @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "hence the interaction and merging processes should be frequent in them . as a consequence",
    "some shcgs could be a radio and fir emitters .",
    "however due to larger distances and different morphological content ( tiersh et al .",
    "@xcite ) we could expect smaller rate of radio and fir detections from shcgs in comparison with hcgs .",
    "the results of the search for fir emission of shcgs were published recently by tmtst . in this paper",
    "we present the results of a search for radio emission from shcgs .",
    "three hundred seventy seven groups were included in the original lists of shcgs .",
    "the positions of the group centers were given with accuracies of about @xmath6 .",
    "for identification of radio sources with shcgs we used accurate coordinates of member galaxies measured afterwards from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) by stoll et al .",
    "( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "positions of four groups , shcg 206 , 241 , 301 and 353 , were largely incorrect in original lists , and they were not found during accurate position measurements . it was revealed also that the group shcg 214 coincides with shcg 252 , and the group shcg 340 consists of two groups , shcg 340a and shcg 340b .",
    "spectral observations showed that five groups , shcg 12 , 13 , 78 , 146 , and 180 , consist mainly of stars .",
    "thus we searched for a radio emission at the positions of 367 shcgs .",
    "for looking for a radio emission from shcgs we first examined the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) ( condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) at 1.4 ghz at the positions of all 367 shcgs .",
    "generally an area @xmath7 centered on each group was investigated .",
    "the first survey ( white et al .",
    "@xcite ) , made at the same frequency , was used in addition for those 175 shcgs that are located in the area of the sky , covered by the survey until 1st november 1998 .",
    "the errors of the radio position measurements in the used surveys are small enough . for the nvss sources they vary from @xmath8 for sources stronger than 15 mjy , to @xmath9 at the survey flux limit at @xmath10 mjy ( condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for the first radio sources the errors are smaller : @xmath11 for sources with flux densities @xmath12 mjy , and @xmath13 at the survey treshold of 1 mjy ( white et al .",
    "three hundred fifty three nvss radio sources were found within boundaries of 179 shcgs .",
    "fifty three of these sources were registered also in the first .",
    "seven more sources were found only in the first .",
    "the more correct positions and fluxes on the latter radio sources from the first were used in the farther discussion .",
    "high positional accuracies of the used radio surveys allowed to identify with high confidence some of the found radio sources with certain galaxies in dense environments of shcgs .",
    "the positions of these radio sources coincide appreciably well , generally within @xmath14 , with corresponding objects in shcgs .",
    "the probability of the reality of radio identifications was estimated by the `` likelihood ratio '' ( lr ) ( de ruiter et al .",
    "it was assumed that the density of background radio sources is @xmath15 per @xmath16 for high galactic latitudes ( cohen et al .",
    "@xcite )    the identification was considered as reliable if @xmath17 .",
    "this may not be very correct in this case , since we identify radio sources in dense groups of galaxies .",
    "for this reason we inspected each identification on the dss images .",
    "ninety three of the found 353 radio sources were identified with certain objects in 74 shcgs .",
    "the list of identifications is presented in table 1 .",
    "the shakhbazian designation of the group and the number of the galaxy ( as labelled in the original shcg finding charts ) , considered to be the radio emitter , is given in the first row of column 1 .",
    "the ra and dec ( j2000.0 ) of the galaxy are given in columns 2 and 3 of the first row . in the second row",
    "the designation of the identified radio source ( column 1 ) , its coordinates ( column 2 and 3 ) , and the flux density ( column 4 ) are given .    in five cases",
    "( shcg 054 , 163 , 298 , 347 , and 352 ) the nvss radio source is located between two nearby galaxies , and it was not possible to determine which of them is the radio emitter .",
    "it could not be excluded , however , that both galaxies are radio emitters .",
    "two or more radio emitting galaxies were found in thirteen shcgs .",
    "radio sources found within boundaries of nine shcgs : 051 , 057 , 120 , 203 , 248 , 250 , 330 , 346 , and 352 , coincide appreciably well with the positions of relatively weak objects , not considered as member galaxies of corresponding groups in the original shcg lists .",
    "these identifications should be considered as tentative .",
    "though the mentioned objects could , however , be members of corresponding groups .",
    "future spectral observations of these weak objects may clarify whether they are really members of the corresponding groups .",

    "the list of the latter galaxies is presented in table 4 .",
    "the consideration of fig .",
    "3 shows that radio sources in shcgs are more powerful .",
    "indeed , the radio luminosities of more than half of hcgs located at redshifts @xmath45 are less than 22.0 @xmath46 , while only one out of eleven shcgs at the same distances has such low radio luminosity .",
    "it is seen also that most of powerful shcg radio sources are located at larger distances , where no hcgs were found .",
    "since redshifts are known for only a limited sample of shcgs , it is not yet possible to study the radio luminosity function of shcg galaxies .",
    "such study may be done after compilition of the program initieted by tiersch et al .",

    "the 60  @xmath0 m iras band was by far the most sensitive for the detection of extragalactic objects ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .    for star forming galaxies a very close connection between two apparently unrelated physical mechanisms , the thermal emission from a dust and the synchrotron radio emission from relitivistic electrons ,",

    "it was shown that the ratio of the fir and radio fluxes of starburst galaxies is almost constant .",
    "if the ratio of the fir and radio fluxes of galaxies in the considered cgs is also constant , as it is in the star forming galaxies , then due to different distances from us , and also due to differences in the emitted fluxes , the cg galaxies should be distributed on fig .",

    "the high accuracies of radio positional measurements allowed to identify with high confidence the detected radio source with a certain galaxy in the corresponding cg .",
    "the situation is not the same in the case of the iras fir observations .",
    "absolute positions provided by the iras are accurate up to @xmath49 ( within @xmath50 ) in the in - scan and @xmath51 in the cross - scan directions respectively . in the case of hcgs , that are nearer to us and",
    "have relatively larger angular dimensions in comparison with shcgs , in most cases ( 37 out of 47 ) it was possible to identify the detected fir source with a certain galaxy in the corresponding group ( allam et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the fir sources detected in shcgs ( tmtst ) are in general weaker than those in hcgs .",
    "as a result their positional measurement accuracies reach usually values of about @xmath22 to @xmath52 in the in - scan and the cross - scan directions respectively . for this reason , and also for the relatively smaller angular sizes of shcgs it was not possible to determine with certainty which galaxy in a dense group",
    "is the fir emitter ( tmtst ) . as a probable one the brightest member of the group",
    "was usually mentioned . for construction of fig .",
    "4 we attributed the measured fir flux eather to a single galaxy or to two nearby galaxies ( see subsection 3.2 ) . this uncertainty does not however influence the made conclusions .",
    "the consideration of fig .",
    "4 shows that most of hcg galaxies ( 30 out 47 , i.e. @xmath53 ) are located along and somewhat lower of the arbitrarily drawn diagonal dashed line .",
    "these galaxies thus obey the correlation between the thermal emission from a dust and the synchrotron radio emission from relitivistic electrons found for star forming galaxies , and hence they also are sb galaxies .",
    "galaxies that are lower of the dashed line apparently have relatively stronger fir emission . along the same dashed line",
    "are distributed , as it was expected , also most of markarian sb galaxies .",
    "seventeen hcg galaxies ( @xmath54 ) are higher of the dashed line .",
    "it means that they have stronger radio emission than sb galaxies .",
    "it is remarkable that two of these galaxies , hcg 92c and hcg 96a , are seyferts , and three others , hcg 56b , hcg 68a and hcg 68b , are e and s0 type galaxies .",
    "the situation is different for shcg galaxies .",
    "nine of them ( 82% ) are located above the arbitrarily drawn diagonal line . above this line",
    "are located also twelve out of thirteen ( @xmath55 ) markarian - seyfert galaxies .",
    "hence most of shcg galaxies are not sb galaxies .",
    "if the identification of the fir source with a radio emitting galaxy is not correct then the galaxy with detected radio emission and thus with smaller fir emission would move on fig .",
    "4 to the left and hence would be located even higher of the dashed line .",
    "the blending of a few probable fir sources in dense groups would have the same effect .",
    "it is worth to note that those hcg and shcg galaxies for which either fir or radio emission was detected would also have different locations on the log@xmath47-log@xmath48 graph .",
    "there are 73 shcg galaxies , fluxes of which at 1.4 ghz exceed 1 jy , but only upper limits of fluxes at 60 @xmath0 m were determined ( tmtst ) .",
    "these galaxies would apparently be located on fig .",
    "4 higher of the dashed line .",
    "at the same time there are only fifteen shcg galaxies with determined fir fluxes ( tmtst ) , and radio fluxes lower than 1 jy detection limit ( this paper ) .",
    "the latter would be located lower of the dashed line . in the case of hcg galaxies",
    "the situation is vice versa .",
    "there are 34 hcg galaxies with 1.4 ghz fluxes exceeding the 1 mjy limit ( menon @xcite , and present paper ) , and the fir fluxes lower than the limiting value ( allam et al .",
    "these galaxies would be located on fig .",
    "4 upper of the dashed line .",
    "much more hcg galaxies , 65 , with measured fir fluxes and upper limits of radio fluxes , would be located below the dashed line , in the lower part of fig .",
    "4 . thus in the case of galaxies with eather one of the fluxes ( eather 60 @xmath0 m or 1.4 ghz ) measured , we see the same trend : most shcg galaxies would be located upper of the dashed line on fig .",
    "meanwhile hcg galaxies would be located mainly below this line .",
    "sulentic & de mello rabaca ( @xcite ) claimed that the fir sources in hcgs are likely the combined contribution of two or more members . if to assume that in all hickson s groups with detected fir emission , the fir emitters are in reality two galaxies with equal fluxes , then the corresponding points on fig .",
    "4 should move to the left by 0.3 , and still they would be located lower than shcg galaxies . moreover , if the same is valid also for the more dense shcgs , then the corresponding positions of shcg galaxies on fig . 4 should also move to the left , and the found trend would certainly not be altered .",
    "hence , one may conclude that galaxies in shcgs are relatively stronger radio emitters , while hcg galaxies are stronger fir emitters .",
    "it means that physical conditions in shcgs are somehow favorable for triggering the agns with relatively strong synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons , while in hcgs the conditions are favorable for formation of sb galaxies with relatively strong thermal dust emission",
    ". what could be the reason for such difference ?",
    "cgs are generally very dense formations . according to n - body simulations ( carnevali et al .",
    "@xcite , barnes @xcite , @xcite , mamon @xcite , zheng et al .",
    "@xcite ) the member galaxies at high density environments of cgs should interact and merge in one large galaxy in about @xmath56 years .",
    "for this reason the very existence of cgs has been questioned by some authors ( walke & mamon @xcite , mamon @xcite , @xcite , hernquist et al .",
    "meanwhile hickson & rood ( @xcite ) , mendes de oliveira & giraud ( @xcite ) , mendes de oliveira ( @xcite ) , oleak et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and recently tovmassian et al . (",
    "@xcite ) presented firm evidences on the reality of cgs .",
    "for explaining the existence of cgs governato et al .",
    "( @xcite ) proposed a second generation merger scenario , according to which cgs permanently aggregate new members from their surrounding areas .",
    "such scenario could be valid since , according to rood & williams ( @xcite ) , vennik et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and ramella et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , most of hcgs are associated with loose groups of galaxies .",
    "shcgs and hcgs differ from each other by the number of members and by morphological content .",
    "if hcgs contain generally four - five members , shcgs have up to fifteen members .",
    "the relative number of e or s0 type galaxies in hcgs compose only @xmath57 of all members ( hickson et al .",
    "@xcite ) , while shggs are more rich in early type galaxies .",
    "about 77% member galaxies in the latter are of e and s0 type ( tiersch et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for this reason shcgs",
    "are considered as more evolved systems in comparison with hcgs .    since almost half of hcg galaxies are spirals with sufficient amount of gas and dust , the gravitational interaction between them and with a suggested newcomer galaxy may trigger starburst processes in interacting galaxies .",
    "the fir emission is characteristic to such events .",
    "meanwhile in the more evolved shcgs most galaxies are of e and s0 type , and the number of spirals is relatively small . the gas was pushed out from them during previous interaction processes between galaxies , and filled the intergalactic space .",
    "the spirals here should have shed also their dust content .",
    "the presence of intergalactic gas in cgs was proved by the detection of diffuse x - ray emission ( ebeling et al .",
    "@xcite , pildis et al .",
    "@xcite , saracco & ciliegi @xcite , tiersch et al .",
    "@xcite ) from some of the groups . due to the interaction with a newcomer galaxy to the group",
    "this intergalactic gas may be falling in the form of cooling flows directly into the center of the preferentially dominant early type galaxy in the group . in the result of this an active nucleus of the galaxy with sufficiently strong radio emission",
    "may be formed . due to small amount or even absence of dust in such galaxies",
    "their fir emission would be very weak or even completely absent .",
    "three hundred fifty three nvss ( condon et al .",
    "@xcite ) radio sources are found within boundaries of 179 shcgs .",
    "sixty sources were registered also in the first ( white et al .",
    "@xcite ) survey , of which seven sources - only in the first .",
    "the comparison of the radio and fir fluxes of galaxies in hcgs and shcgs showed that the latter are more stronger radio emitters , while hcg galaxies are generally more stronger fir emitters .",
    "it is suggested that the reason for this may be that shcgs are more evolved in comparison with hcgs , and galaxies in them do not have enough dust for attributing the fir emission .",
    "on the other hand the conditions in shcgs are more favorable for formation of agn with relatively stronger radio emission .",
