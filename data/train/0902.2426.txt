    "they considered a two - component model , in which the total luminosity is the sum of an unbeamed part and a beamed jet luminosity .",
    "the beamed lfs of fr ii radio galaxies are consistent with the observed lfs of fsrqs and steep spectrum radio quasars ( ssrqs ) , which strengthens the unification of fr ii galaxies and radio quasars ( see * ? ? ?",

    "they suggested that most fr i radio galaxies are accreting at lower rates compared with fr iis , which could correspond to different accretion modes in fr i and fr ii radio galaxies .",
    "if the black hole is spinning rapidly , the rotational energy of the black hole is expected to be transferred to the jets by the magnetic fields threading the holes , namely , the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite . the jet can also be accelerated by the large - scale fields threading the rotating accretion disk ( i.e. , the blandford - payne ( bp ) mechanism , * ? ? ? * ) .",
