    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) are thought to exist in almost all massive galaxies @xcite . in the local universe ,",
    "the vast majority of these smbhs are now quiescent , and radiate at many orders of magnitude less than the eddington luminosity ; most notably , this is observed for the galactic centre smbh , sgr a * @xcite .",
    "increased star formation rates ( sfrs ) , along with massive stars , are seen towards the centre of many galaxies @xcite .",
    "the best studied nucleus containing these features is that of the milky way , where massive stars have been observed in a high concentration out to half a parsec from the smbh ( for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally believed that winds from these stars are accreted on to the smbh through a radiatively inefficient flow , which results in a gas density that is a decreasing power - law function of radius from the smbh @xcite .",
    "these massive stars are also the eventual progenitors of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) in galactic nuclei . within the sphere of influence of sgr",
    "a * ( the region within which the gravitational potential of the smbh is dominant ) , evidence for at least one supernova event has been observed in the supernova remnant ( snr ) sgr a east .",
    "this snr appears to be engulfing sgr a * with a radius of several @xmath6 , and its age has been estimated to be @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "recently , _ xmm - newton _ observations over a larger scale in the galactic centre have been interpreted to suggest the presence of a second snr , some @xmath8 across @xcite .",
    "in addition , a number of stellar remnants have been detected in the sgr a * sphere of influence , pointing again towards supernova explosions in the past of this nucleus .",
    "the cannonball neutron star ( cxogc j174545.5 - 285829 ) has been proposed as originating from the supernova event that created sgr a east , and is currently close to the edge of the snr ejecta shell @xcite ; tracing its motion back to the centre of the shell suggests an age of @xmath9 @xcite . recently , a magnetar ( sgr j17452900 ) was discovered at @xmath10 from sgr a * , and this has been postulated as being associated with the possible @xmath8 snr @xcite .",
    "the presence of stellar remnants within the sphere of influence has also been confirmed from the observation of at least four x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) within @xmath11 of the smbh , though whether they are high- or low - mass xrbs is uncertain @xcite .    unlike those in the solar neighbourhood ,",
    "the snrs in galactic nuclei evolve in an exceptional gaseous environment that is dominated by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the smbh .",
    "the importance of understanding how snrs evolve in these environments is highlighted , for example , in recent work by @xcite modelling the galactic centre @xmath12-ray excess using a high supernova rate in the region . in a previous paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper i ) , we developed a numerical shock solver to predict the evolution of snrs in quiescent galactic nuclei , and showed how their age , size and shape are influenced by the accretion flow properties .",
    "leveraging the results from that work , here we propose the use of x - ray emission from young snrs to study the close environment of quiescent smbhs .    in searches for low luminosity smbhs ,",
    "x - rays are often used to avoid extra - nuclear contaminants that affect optical emission ( for a recent example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , these x - ray searches are not without their own contaminants , and the emission from xrbs is regularly discussed as a prominent contribution . yet",
    ", if we could observe our galactic centre from a more distant perspective , snr emission would in fact be the dominant contaminant , as the sgr a east snr is brighter than both sgr a * and individually detected xrbs in the sphere of influence .",
    "we are , therefore , interested in how the lifetimes of snrs in other galactic nuclei can be used to estimate the contribution of snrs to the nuclear x - ray emission .",
    "most importantly for us , a dominant contribution from snrs may allow us to use the detected x - ray emission to constrain the gas properties and sfr .",
    "this information may ultimately help us to understand whether there is a connection between the gas component , the young stellar population and the smbh that is universal , as well as the nature of this relationship .",
    "more generally , this would be an important step forward in the understanding of the interplay between smbhs and their host galaxies .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that massive star and gas distributions are self - similar in the sphere of influence of quiescent smbhs , of which our galactic centre provides an observational basis .",
    "the universality of this model does not differentiate between smbh environments by galactic morphology .",
    "therefore , a discussion of core - collapse sne in elliptical galaxies may , at first , appear at odds with the current picture of ellipticals .",
    "the morphology of a galaxy is typically a very decisive factor regarding which type of sne are seen on a galactic scale , and in elliptical galaxies , observational identifications of core - collapse sne are very rare .",
    "they can not be ruled out completely , however , as shown by the observation of a probable stripped core - collapse ( type ib ) supernova sn  2005cz in the outskirts of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4589 , which appears to have undergone some recent star formation due to a merger @xcite .",
    "although most of the volume of elliptical galaxies is devoid of star formation , in the vicinity of the smbh , star formation may still be present within sufficiently cooled accretion flow of stellar winds ( analogous to the possible _ in situ _ origin of the young stars in the galactic centre ) .",
    "surveys of the nuclear regions of local elliptical galaxies suggest an inverse correlation between their nuclear activity and the presence of sufficiently cooled interstellar material near the smbh @xcite . in the case of active nuclei",
    ", the central engine may prevent the cooling of gas , and , in turn , star formation @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is worth reiterating that our results are only in the context of quiescent nuclei .",
    "justifications and details of our self - regulating , ` autarkic ' model are given in section  [ sec : autarkic_model ] , where we present our framework for quiescent smbh environments ( see also paper i ) .",
    "in this context , we then predict the total number of snrs expected in that region at any given time ( section  [ sec : total_numbers ] ) and their total x - ray luminosity , of which we also assess the detectability ( section  [ sec : x - ray ] ) . finally , we derive the associated sfrs ( section  [ sec : sfr ] )",
    ". further elaboration on our findings , and our conclusions , can be found in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the spheres of influence of quiescent smbhs have not experienced major continuous inflows of gas for at least the last @xmath13 , roughly the estimated duty cycle of an active galactic nucleus @xcite . during this time , the smbh mass and its sphere of influence have not appreciably grown in size , and the life cycles of a few to many generations of massive stars have passed .",
    "after most of the original accretion disc has been consumed , the smbh starts accreting from the winds of massive stars at a very sub - eddington level .",
    "the resulting gaseous environment takes the form of an almost spherical , steady - state and radiatively inefficient flow , at least up to a substantial fraction of the sphere of influence @xcite .",
    "therefore , massive star and gas properties reflect the current and local environmental conditions within the sphere of influence . in particular , they have had time to create a steady - state system where massive stars are born from the gas in the local accretion flow and give it back in form of winds and sne . since , from these components , our model describes quiescent nuclei as closed , self - regulating systems , we call this an ` autarkic ' model .    as a consequence of this autarkic behaviour , massive",
    "star and gas distributions should trace each other and their profile be universal among quiescent spheres of influence , with the total number of stars and the accretion rate proportional to the mass of the smbh .",
    "we therefore expect the same properties , regardless of the global galaxy morphology and assembly history of the nucleus , which should instead be imprinted in the low - mass stellar component of the nucleus .    due to our vantage point , we have some knowledge of the gas and star distributions in the galactic centre .",
    "practically , we can therefore use those observations ( section [ sec : model_mw ] ) to quantitatively develop a general description of quiescent galactic nuclei ( section [ sec : model_nuclei ] ) , extending a method first proposed in paper i.      the archetypal quiescent galactic nucleus for this work is our galactic centre .",
    "the smbh mass ( @xmath14 ) of sgr a * is @xmath15 , resulting in a sphere of influence ( hereafter soi ) a few parsecs in radius , within which some @xmath16 worth of stars reside @xcite .",
    "the number density distribution of massive stars in the sphere of influence of sgr a * appears to follow the form of a two - part power law , broken at a radius defined here as @xmath17 @xcite : @xmath18 for some constant @xmath19 , that will be constrained in section  [ sec : total_numbers ] .",
    "the steepness of the gradient outside @xmath17 is more uncertain , due to the low number of stars at this distance ; however , for the same reason , the value of the outer gradient does not have a substantial influence on our results .",
    "the gaseous environment in the soi is dominated by the accretion flow .",
    "the measured density at approximately the scale of the bondi radius ( @xmath20 ) is @xmath21 , where the mass flow has an eddington ratio of @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we take this radius , hereafter referred to as @xmath23 , as a reference point for the density .",
    "a break in the gas density is expected at @xmath24 where the density of high - mass stars drops off @xcite . within @xmath17 ,",
    "the density gradient depends on the mode of energy transport . in standard",
    "advection - dominated accretion flows , the inner power law follows @xmath25 @xcite . for convection - dominated flows @xcite or those with substantial outflows , as in the adiabatic inflow",
    "outflow solution ( adios ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the inner gradient is shallower at @xmath26 .",
    "although more recent observations tend to favour a density gradient of @xmath27 with @xmath26 @xcite , we also explore the whole possible range @xmath28 .",
    "outside @xmath17 , instead , we follow results from simulations and we take @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "finally , it is now well established that a molecular torus exists around sgr a * , which extends from just inside the soi ( @xmath30 ) to about @xmath31 from the smbh @xcite .",
    "the torus has a wedge - like profile , where the inner edge is narrower ( @xmath32 thick ) than the outer edge ( @xmath30 ) , and contains molecular hydrogen with a density of @xmath33 .",
    "we now consider environments of other quiescent galactic nuclei , and we show how their properties can be scaled with the mass of the smbh ( see also paper i ) .",
    "the particular region we are most interested in is the smbh sphere of influence , which contains a total mass in star of @xmath34 , and the size of which can be estimated as a function of smbh mass , using the @xmath35@xmath36 relation @xcite : @xmath37 our reference value for the milky way soi radius is @xmath38 . in the self - similar spirit of our model , we will also scale the break and density reference radii ( @xmath39 and @xmath23 ) proportionally with the soi size . as for the milky way",
    ", we associate @xmath23 with the bondi radius .",
    "this scaling with @xmath40 therefore implies that the temperature of the gas is proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "we will comment on some implications of this later in this section .    within the sphere of influence ,",
    "the number density distribution of massive stars has the form of equation ( [ eq : massive_star_density ] ) , and the total number of these stars is @xmath42 .",
    "this will be quantified in section  [ sec : total_numbers ] , where we will predict the associated steady - state supernova rate and compare with observations .",
    "the gas density profile around the black hole is universally set by accretion physics for a radiatively inefficient flow , and it is described in the previous section .",
    "the number density , @xmath43 , however , should be estimated through the continuity equation , @xmath44 where the radial velocity in a geometrically thick accretion flow is approximately the keplerian value @xmath45 .",
    "since the accretion rate @xmath46 is powered by stellar winds , it increases with the stellar number and therefore with the black hole mass in a proportional fashion , @xmath47 .",
    "this implies that such self - similar quiescent smbhs emit at the same eddington ratio .",
    "it follows that the number density in terms of the milky way value at the radius @xmath23 is @xmath48 equation ( [ eq : gas_number_density ] ) allows us to express the density distributions around other quiescent smbhs purely as a function of their mass .    although other kinds of scaling are possible , this simple scaling with @xmath14 is consistent with recent , more in depth treatments of quiescent smbh circumnuclear media ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* where their stagnation radius is comparable to the bondi radius ) .",
    "moreover , our scaling of @xmath23 with @xmath14 ( such that @xmath49 ) is compatible with the results in @xcite in the high - heating limit , which corresponds to continuous star formation in their work ( which is also assumed here based on observational evidence in the milky way ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all these galactic nuclei , the density is expected to flatten from the @xmath29 gradient around the scale of the soi . in this paper , we more carefully model the ambient density near and beyond the soi with respect to paper  i. we considered a few possible variations for the way the density levels off : a floor of @xmath50 ( irrespective of radius ) , a fixed value of @xmath50 beyond @xmath40 , and a fixed value of @xmath51 .",
    "regardless of the choice , we found the variations in our final results ( such as the variation in the predicted temperatures of section [ sec : spectral_properties ] ) were minimal . in the remaining work ,",
    "we impose a floor in the density at the value @xmath52 .    in this paper , we additionally embed a molecular torus within the power - law ambient medium .",
    "the torus is taken to begin at @xmath40 and extend to @xmath53 from the smbh , with the inner and outer thicknesses described as above ( also scaled by @xmath54 ) . the density within the torus",
    "is taken to be @xmath55 independent of the smbh mass , as it is a property of the molecular cloud .",
    "for our purposes , we need to trace the evolution of snrs ( including their morphology and shock velocity ) in the ambient medium of galactic nuclei explained in section  [ sec : autarkic_model ] . to this end",
    ", we use the method developed in paper i , where the reader can find a detailed description .    in short , this method exploits the kompaneets approximation to follow the evolution of a strong shock from a snr in an axisymmetric configuration of density . in this paper",
    ", we explode the snrs at different distances along the axis of symmetry of the molecular torus . along with the power - law background",
    ", this preserves the axisymmetry of the problem that was originally exploited in the design of our code .",
    "once the shock decelerates , the temperature of the shocked gas becomes sufficiently low for line cooling to efficiently radiate energy from the snr .",
    "prior to this stage , the snr is deemed ` adiabatic ' , as the energy lost is a very small fraction of the total energy in the shocked gas .",
    "we define the end of the adiabatic stage to occur when the snr has succumbed to one of two outcomes : either @xmath56 per cent of the snr , measured by ejecta mass fraction , has reached this radiative stage ( @xmath57 ; @xmath58 ) , or @xmath56 per cent has been sheared apart from decelerating enough that the velocity is comparable to the local keplerian velocity around the smbh .",
    "if deceleration is not appreciable , then the snr shearing happens at a radius @xmath59 where we assumed an ejection velocity of @xmath60 . in all our calculations , @xmath61 is the minimum explosion radius at which a snr can survive .",
    "we have found that including a molecular torus in our simulations does not have a large effect on the snr dynamics or morphology , as the shock front effectively diffracts around the barrier and continues its outward motion after self - intersecting on the far side .",
    "therefore , we do not expect tori of the dimensions considered here to confine or strongly shape the snr once it has expanded to the scale of the sphere of influence .",
    "improving on paper i , the more careful modelling of the environment just outside the soi allows us to more robustly quantify the adiabatic lifetime for snrs that expand beyond the soi , and survive through to the radiative stage .",
    "we find that , regardless of the specific choice in the way the density flattens ( section  [ sec : model_nuclei ] ) , the adiabatic stage ends after a similar time , around @xmath62 .",
    "more generally , we calculate the adiabatic lifetime @xmath63 of a snr as a function of distance within the soi , regardless of its fate ( whether sheared or not ) .",
    "we then compute , for a given black hole mass , the mean adiabatic lifetime @xmath64 by weighting @xmath63 by the number density of massive stars at that location ( equation  [ eq : massive_star_density ] ; for more detail see section  5.3 in paper i ) . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes_and_numbers ] , with the circles and dashed lines ( left - hand axis ) .",
    "the three inner density gradients @xmath28 are shown , where the red line , @xmath26 , corresponds to that favoured by observations in the milky way .",
    "for @xmath65 , the average snr ends its life evolving through the radiative phase , while for @xmath66 the combination of ambient medium deceleration and black hole tidal forces disperse the snr before the radiative stage , shortening the duration of its x - ray emitting phase .",
    "the suppression of adiabatic lifetime increases with @xmath14 and at @xmath67 is an order of magnitude smaller for @xmath26 .     and",
    "@xmath68 , measured by shearing a total of @xmath69 . by @xmath70 ,",
    "radiative losses become significant in all cases ; if the shearing condition @xmath71 has not yet been met by this time , the adiabatic stage ends due to the radiative transition ( indicated by a dotted black line at low @xmath14 .",
    "the squares with solid lines ( right - hand axis ) show the expected number of adiabatic snrs in galactic nuclei as calculated in equation ( [ eq : expected_number ] ) , with a scaling based on the observation of one core - collapse snr in the milky way . in each case , the red ( lowermost ) line corresponds to an inner gas gradient @xmath26 , the green line is for @xmath72 and the blue ( uppermost ) line is for @xmath25 .",
    "the reduction in lifetime by smbh shearing is compared with the value expected if snrs ended their adiabatic stage from radiative losses alone ( @xmath70 ) , shown as a black dot  dashed line . ]",
    "using results for the lifetimes of snrs as a function of distance within the soi , we proceed to calculate the average number ( @xmath73 ) of core - collapse snrs that could be observed at any given time in x - ray , within the soi of an smbh .",
    "knowledge of @xmath73 will allow us to later determine the expected contribution of young snrs to the x - ray emission near the smbh .",
    "we assume here that the accretion flow refilling time - scale from stellar winds is similar to , or shorter than , the supernova rate , such that , on average , previous snrs do not significantly effect the gaseous environment of subsequent snrs .",
    "this appears to be the case for the milky way , where simulations show that a quasi - steady - state gas distribution matching the one we assume here is reached over a time - scale ( @xmath74 ) , which is an order of magnitude shorter than the expected supernova rate of one per @xmath75 @xcite . in more massive nuclei , we expect the time between sne to shorten proportionally to the mass input from stellar winds , sustaining the competing effects of supernova sweeping and wind refilling .    in a steady state case ,",
    "the massive stars are replenished by star formation at the same rate as they explode as sne , and their number at any location is independent of time . in this case , @xmath76 in any spherical shell of distance @xmath77 from the smbh .",
    "the number of ` adiabatic ' remnants , @xmath73 , expected at any time in the soi is thus @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the stellar lifetime @xmath80 , weighted over the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath81 , for @xmath82 . as for the stellar and gas distributions ,",
    "we take a universal current imf in black hole sois .",
    "to solve generally for @xmath73 , the total number of massive stars , @xmath83 , as a function of @xmath14 is required .",
    "this will allow us to determine @xmath84 in the definition of @xmath85 ( equation [ eq : massive_star_density ] ) , which in turn is to be used in equation [ eq : expected_number ] .",
    "for @xmath86 , equation ( [ eq : expected_number ] ) is simplified by the fact that our simulations , as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes_and_numbers ] , show @xmath87 to be constant ( @xmath62 ) over @xmath77 within the soi , since there is no explosion location where snrs are destroyed by shearing .",
    "we can therefore divide through by @xmath87 and write equation ( [ eq : expected_number ] ) as a supernova rate : @xmath88 from these equalities , we estimate @xmath89 , using observations to set a value for @xmath90 and @xmath73 , as explained below .    for @xmath90 , the mass distribution of core - collapse progenitors is needed .",
    "@xcite find that the long - term star formation in the milky way nuclear star cluster is best fit by an approximately chabrier / kroupa imf , @xmath91 with this imf , the mean stellar lifetime for core - collapse progenitors is @xmath92 where stars above @xmath93 are taken to form black holes directly without a corresponding supernova @xcite .. ] note that this mass function does not describe the current stellar content of the galactic centre , since the majority of the total stellar mass is in the longer - lived low - mass stars , most of which formed more than @xmath94 ago @xcite .",
    "the present - day mass function is also modified by accumulated stellar remnants .    as mentioned in section [ sec : model_mw ]",
    ", there are one or two potential snrs within the soi of sgr a * : the sgr a east shell and a possible snr suggested by @xcite in observations of the @xmath95 x - ray emitting lobes .",
    "sgr a east has been argued to be a @xmath96-year - old type ii snr that is transitioning to the radiative phase @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 structure may be an snr of similar age , possibly associated with the @xmath97-@xmath98-old magnetar sgr  j17452900 in the sphere of influence @xcite .",
    "taking at least one of these two possible snrs to have been generated by a core - collapse supernova in the soi , we set @xmath99 . through equation ( [ eq : supernova_rate ] ) , we then derive @xmath100 for the milky way .",
    "there is , however , evidence to suggest that the imf of , at least , the recently formed stellar disc(s ) is more top - heavy ( @xmath101 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we also consider the effect of using @xmath102 in equation ( [ eq : imf ] ) .",
    "this reduces the mean stellar lifetime to @xmath103 , and , therefore , @xmath89 is reduced to @xmath104 .",
    "these values of @xmath89 are slightly higher than the number of sufficiently massive stars found in recent censuses of the inner half parsec ( around a few hundred ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though some discrepancy may be expected if current @xmath105-band spectroscopic limits restrict these observations to very early - type stars and the innermost region @xcite .",
    "since @xmath89 is proportional to the total stellar mass and @xmath106 , the scaling with the mass of the smbh is simply @xmath107 equation  ( [ eq : expected_number ] ) can now be solved generally for quiescent nuclei as a function of @xmath14 , and our result is shown in the solid lines ( right - hand axis ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes_and_numbers ] .",
    "the number of observed snrs at any given time grows with @xmath14 from @xmath99 for @xmath108 to around @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "this trend is the result of two competing effects : as @xmath14 increases , snr lifetimes become shorter but the total number of massive stars increases ( equation  [ eq : number_cc ] ) .",
    "since the latter grows faster , the net behaviour is a positive gradient .    the dot  dashed black line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes_and_numbers ] shows a comparison with the case if snr lifetimes were not ended by shearing , but instead continued through a final radiative phase ( @xmath111 ) , as is typical in a constant ism . in this case ,",
    "@xmath112 , while our results ( solid lines ) show a sublinear growth .",
    "the reduction is most prominent at the highest masses , where the mean x - ray lifetime of a snr is several times smaller than @xmath113 .",
    "a spread in the expected number of remnants can be seen to be dependent on the choice of inner gas gradient around @xmath67 , where the red and blue lines differ by a factor of 3 .",
    "we will show later that most of local galaxies suitable for x - ray observations have smbhs around that mass ( section  [ sec : detectability ] ) .",
    "therefore , our result suggests that , in principle , it may be possible to use these nuclei to probe the inner accretion flow .",
    "we will elaborate on this point later , when we discuss our results on the expected total luminosities ( sections  [ sec : detectability ] and [ sec : conclusion ] ) .    in the remainder of this paper , however , we will only present results for @xmath26 , as this is the most favoured value from recent observations of the galactic centre @xcite .",
    "also , this gives a conservative lower limit for our predictions , and , as will be apparent later , our luminosity estimates are more uncertain than the difference between results from alternative gas density profiles .",
    "simultaneous snrs in their adiabatic phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes_and_numbers ] ) should contribute to the x - ray emission from quiescent nuclei . here",
    ", we aim to quantify their total soft and hard x - ray luminosity , compare it to other sources and assess its detectability . in the x - ray band ,",
    "the snr dominant emission mechanism is bremsstrahlung radiation , unless the snr is sweeping into a very rarefied environment @xcite .    therefore , to make an estimate of their relative brightness in the hard and soft band",
    ", we first make predictions of the gas temperature behind the snr shocks .",
    "we calculate this temperature as a function of time as well as the most probable age of a snr in a single observation , as very young snrs are hotter than old ones .",
    "we characterize the temperature of snrs in the sphere of influence of an smbh by analysing data from the simulations outlined in paper i. the challenge is that the medium is not uniform and different parts of the remnant hold different temperatures and luminosities , and these quantities change with time . since we want to characterize the emission in a snapshot observation , we need a measure of the temperature that most contributes to the snr spectrum , at its most probable age . we proceed as follows .",
    "we first determine the temperature behind each point along the shock using the shock front velocity , @xmath114 , via @xmath115 for an adiabatic exponent of @xmath116 , and where @xmath117 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath118 is the mean molecular mass , and @xmath119 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "at a given moment in time , the snr mean temperature is found by weighting the temperature behind the shock , @xmath120 , at each point along the shock front , by the rate of radiative cooling over the line - dominated ( low temperature ) and bremsstrahlung - dominated ( high temperature ) regimes , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the density behind the shock . for a strong shock ,",
    "the postshock density is found simply from the compression ratio @xmath123 .",
    "next , @xmath120 is weighted by the surface area , ` @xmath124 ' , of each section of the snr , which is the conical frustum ( excluding circular caps ) obtained by rotating the small cross - sectional segments of the shock front at that position about the axis of symmetry .",

    "they clearly show how initially a supernova may be tens of @xmath131 hot , while thousands of years later its temperature can be well below @xmath132 .",
    "the snr depicted with the solid line has an ejecta mass of @xmath127 , while the dashed line shows the case for an ejecta mass of @xmath128 , to investigate variation in ejecta mass behind the shock front .",
    "the shock velocity at the start of the ejecta - dominated stage in our simulations is determined by depositing the @xmath133 of explosion energy as kinetic energy into the given ejecta mass .",

    "we use the total number of snrs to estimate the total x - ray emission expected from these regions . one caveat , noted also in paper i , is that the kompaneets approximation may overestimate the ` adiabatic ' lifetimes of snrs . correcting for this may reduce the x - ray luminosities predicted here , in particular for low - mass smbhs ( which have , on average , longer lived snrs ) .",
    "we find that , for nuclei with properties like that of our galactic centre , core - collapse snrs can compete with the emission from x - ray binaries as well as unresolved sources , and can potentially outshine the emission from the central engine itself .",

    "for example , stellar tidal disruption events like that of _ swift _  j1644 + 57 produce smbh flaring observed in radio through to x - rays @xcite .",
    "an inwards deposition of molecular gas , tidally disrupted into a disc , might also be responsible for the formation of some of the young stars around smbhs @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that , although snrs tend to sweep gas out of their environment , explosions near the smbh may also , at a smaller scale , deposit some material near the smbh , enhancing accretion and causing temporary flaring .    with respect to outflows ,",

    ", we find that the supernova energy is larger than the binding energy at low @xmath14 , and that the gravitational binding energy of the gas grows faster than the supernova energy input , but the two values only become comparable by large smbh masses ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "if the supernova energy is efficiently deposited into kinetics of the nuclear gas , then outflows due to sne in quiescent nuclei may be important around lower mass smbhs .",
    "large - scale expulsion of gas may temporarily reduce the rate of accretion from stellar winds ; however , as has been shown for lower mass smbhs like sgr a * ( section  [ sec : total_numbers ] , the gas refilling time - scale is shorter than the supernova rate .",
    "such core - collapse - induced outflows from low - mass smbhs are a potentially interesting topic of future work .",

    "this model will no doubt become better informed .",
    "we have shown that this autarkic model applied to young stars , gas , and the snrs amongst them , is a promising framework to understand how these nuclei function and evolve .",
    "the predictions of our model can be tested and refined by x - ray observations and sfr estimates of quiescent galactic nuclei .",

    "<S> appreciable star formation , and , therefore , numerous massive stars , are frequently found near supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . as a result , core - collapse supernovae in these regions </S>",

    "<S> we present these results in the context of ` autarkic ' nuclei , a model that describes quiescent nuclei as steady - state and self - sufficient environments where the smbh accretes stellar winds with no appreciable inflow of material from beyond the sphere of influence . </S>",
    "<S> these regions have properties such as gas density that scale with the mass of the smbh . using predictions of the x - ray lifetimes of snrs originating in the sphere of influence , we make estimates of the number of core collapse snrs present at a given time . with the knowledge of lifetimes of snrs and their association with young stars , </S>",
    "<S> we predict a number of core - collapse snrs that grows from @xmath0 around milky way - like ( @xmath1 ) smbhs to @xmath2 around the highest mass ( @xmath3 ) smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of young snrs will amplify the x - ray emission near quiescent smbhs , and we show that the total core - collapse snr emission has the potential to influence soft x - ray searches for very low - luminosity smbhs . </S>",
    "<S> our snr lifetime estimates also allow us to predict star formation rates in these regions . assuming a steady - state replenishment of massive stars </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate a star formation rate density of @xmath4 @xmath5 around the milky way smbh , and a similar value around other smbhs due to a weak dependence on smbh mass . this value is consistent with currently available observations .    </S>",
