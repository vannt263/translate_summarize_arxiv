    "consider a square lattice of which each site except one is filled with a hard - core particle .",
    "the empty site is referred to as a `` vacancy '' .",
    "the particles move randomly on the lattice , their random walks being constrained by the condition that each site can be at most singly occupied .",
    "more specifically , at each moment of time @xmath14 one particle selected with probability @xmath15 among the four particles surrounding the vacancy will exchange its position with the vacancy .",
    "suppose next that one selects one of the particles , `` tags '' it and follows its trajectory @xmath16 .",
    "evidently , dynamics of the tagged - the tracer particle ( tp ) will be quite complicated , in contrast to the standard , by definition , lattice random walk executed by the vacancy : the tp can move only when encountered by the vacancy and its successive moves will be correlated , since the vacancy will always have a greater probability to return for its next encounter from the direction it has left than from a perpendicular or opposite direction . on the other hand , it is clear that on a two - dimensional lattice the tp will make infinitely long excursions as @xmath17 even in the presence of a single vacancy , since its random walk is recursive in 2d and the vacancy is certain to encounter the tracer particle many times .",
    "a natural question is , of course , what are the statistical properties of the tp random walk , its mean - square displacement @xmath18 from its initial position at time moment @xmath1 , and the probability @xmath19 that at time @xmath1 the tp appears at position @xmath20 ?",
    "the just described model , which represents , in fact , one of the simplest cases of the so - called `` slaved diffusion processes '' , has been studied over the years in various guises , ranging from the `` constrained dynamics '' model of palmer @xcite , vacancy - mediated bulk diffusion in metals and crystals ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , frictional properties of dynamical percolative environments @xcite or dynamics of impure atoms in close - packed surfaces of metal crystals , such as , e.g. , a copper @xcite .",
    "brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite were first to present an exact solution of this model in the lattice formulation .",
    "it has been shown that in the presence of a single vacancy the tp trajectories are remarkably confined ; the mean - square displacement shows an unbounded growth , but it does grow only @xmath21 with time , @xmath22 which implies that the tp diffusivity @xmath4 , defined as @xmath23 is not constant but rather vanishes as time @xmath1 progresses .",
    "moreover , it has been found @xcite that at sufficiently large times @xmath19 converges to a limiting form as a function of the scaling variable @xmath24 . still striking ,",
    "this limiting distribution is not a @xmath25 but a modified bessel function @xmath26 , which signifies that the successive steps of the tp , although separated by long time intervals , are effectively correlated .",
    "these results have been subsequently reproduced by means of different analytical techniques in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "brummelhuis and hilhorst have also generalized their analytical approach to the case of a very small but finite vacancy concentration @xmath9 @xcite , in which case a conventional diffusive - type behavior @xmath27 has been recovered .",
    "note that eq.([diff ] ) coincides with the earlier result of nakazato and kitahara @xcite in the limit @xmath28 , and is well confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the following , rather fundamental to our point , problem : suppose that we charge the tracer particle , ( while the rest are kept neutral ) , and switch on an electric field @xmath29 .",
    "in such a situation , the tp will have asymmetric hopping probabilities and in its exchanges with the vacancy , depending on the tp and vacancy relative orientation , the tp will have a preferency ( or , on contrary , a reduction of the rate ) for exchanging its position with the vacancy compared to other three neighboring particles .",
    "one might expect that in this case the tp mean displacement @xmath2 will not be exactly equal to zero and might define the tp mobility as @xmath30 now , the question is whether the mobility @xmath7 , calculated from the tp mean displacement in the presence of an external electric field , and the diffusivity @xmath4 , eq.([di ] ) , deduced from the tp mean - square displacement in the absence of the field , obey the generalized einstein relation of the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the reciprocal temperature ?",
    "note that this question has been already addressed within the context of the tp diffusion in one - dimensional hard - core lattice gases with arbitrary finite vacancy concentration @xcite .",
    "it has been found that eq.([einstein ] ) holds not only for the tp diffusion in a 1d hard - core gas on a finite lattice @xcite , but also for infinite 1d lattices with non - conserved @xcite and conserved particles number @xcite .",
    "remarkably , in the latter case eq.([einstein ] ) holds for @xmath1 sufficiently large despite the fact that both the tp mobility and the diffusivity are not constant as @xmath8 but all vanish in proportion to @xmath33 @xcite . on the other hand , it is well known that the einstein relation is violated in some physical situations ; for instance , it is not fulfilled for sinai diffusion @xcite or diffusion on percolation clusters , due to effects of strong temporal trapping in the dangling ends ( see also refs.@xcite and @xcite for some other examples ) .",
    "hence , in principle , it is not @xmath34 clear whether eq.([einstein ] ) should be valid for the model under study ; here , the tp walk procceds only due to encounters with a @xmath35 vacancy , its mean - square displacement grows only @xmath21 with time and the diffusivity follows much faster decay law in eq.([di ] ) , compared to the @xmath36 law obtained for the one - dimensional systems with finite vacancy concentrations .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we present more precise formulation of the problem and introduce basic notations . in section 3",
    "we discuss our general approach to computation of the probability @xmath37 of finding the tp at position @xmath38 at time moment @xmath1 and to evaluate @xmath37 in the general form as a function of some return probabilities describing the random walk executed by the vacancy .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to calculation of these return probabilities in the general case , as well as to the derivation of explicit expressions determining their asymptotical behavior . in section 5 ,",
    "we present explicit asymptotical results for both the probability distribution and the tp mean displacement .",
    "we show that as @xmath8 , @xmath37 written in terms of two appropriate scaling variables , converges to a rather unusual limiting distribution .",
    "we also demonstrate here that the tp mobility , which is obtained in the present work in the leading in @xmath1 order , and the tp diffusivity in the unbiased case , calculated earlier by brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite , do obey the einstein relation . further on , in section 6 we extend our approach to the situation with very small but finite vacancy concentration and determine , in the leading in @xmath1 order , the tp mobility .",
    "we show that also in this case the tp mobility and the tp diffusivity in the unbiased case do obey the einstein relation , in the linear in @xmath9 approximation and in the leading in @xmath1 order . finally ,",
    "in section 7 , we conclude with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "consider a two - dimensional , infinite in both @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions , square lattice every site of which except one ( a vacancy ) is filled by identical hard - core particles ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "all particles except one are electrically neutral .",
    "the charged particle , which is initially at the origin , will be referred to in what follows as the tracer particle - the tp .",
    "its position at the lattice at time @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "electric field @xmath0 of strength @xmath41 is oriented in the positive @xmath39 direction . for simplicity",
    ", the charge of the tp is set equal to unity .",
    "next , we suppose that at each tick of the clock , @xmath14 , each particle selects at random a jump direction and attempts to hop onto the target site",
    ". evidently , the jump event can be only successful for four particles adjacent to the vacancy .",
    "the form of the jump direction probabilities depends on whether the particle is charged or not . for uncharged particles all hopping directions are equally probable and hence ,",
    "all jump direction probabilities are equal to @xmath15 . on the other hand , the charged particle - the tp , `` prefers '' to jump in the direction of the applied electric field ; the normalized jump direction probabilities of the tp are given , in a usual fashion , by @xmath42 , \\label{defp}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the normalization constant , @xmath44 is the unit vector denoting the jump direction , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 stands for the scalar product .",
    "we adopt the notations @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which means that @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) is the unit vector in the positive ( negative ) @xmath39-direction , while @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) is the unit vector in the positive ( negative ) @xmath40-direction .",
    "consequently , the normalization constant @xmath43 is @xmath53,\\ ] ] where the sum with the subscript @xmath54 denotes summation over all possible orientations of the vector @xmath55 ; that is , @xmath56 .",
    "note that the jump direction probabilities defined by eqs.([defp ] ) and ( [ zo ] ) do preserve the detailed balance condition .     two - dimensional , infinite in both directions , square lattice in which all sites except one are filled with identical hard - core particles ( grey spheres ) .",
    "the black sphere denotes a single tracer particle , which is subject to external field @xmath29 , oriented in the positive @xmath39 direction , and thus has asymmetric hopping propabilities . ]",
    "next , it is expedient to reformulate the dynamics between two consequtive jumps of the tp in terms of the random walk executed by the vacancy and its jump direction probabilities @xmath57 . from the viewpoint of the vacancy , the jump direction probabilities depend on whether the tp is one of four surrounding particles or not .",
    "evidently , in case when all four surrounding particles are electrically neutral , we still have that on the next time step the vacancy will change its position with one of four neighboring particles selected at random with equal probabilities .",
    "hence , in case when the tp is not adjacent to the vacancy , all four jump directions for the vacancy are equally probable , i.e. @xmath58 . on the other hand , the situation is a bit more complex when one of these four particles is the tp , which has asymmetric jump direction probabilities , eq.([defp ] ) .",
    "a natural choice of the @xmath59 ) . ] jump direction probabilities of the vacancy in this case is as follows : suppose that at time moment @xmath1 the tracer particle is at position @xmath16 and the vacancy occupies an adjacent site @xmath60 . then , an exchange of the positions between the tp and the vacancy , which implies that the tp is moved one step in the @xmath61-direction , takes place with the probability @xmath62 while the probability of the exchange of positions with any of other three adjacent particles is given by @xmath63 the normalization constant @xmath64 in this case is , evidently , @xmath65 where @xmath66 has been defined previously in eq.([defp ] ) .",
    "consequently , apart of four sites in the immediate vicintiy of the tracer particle , the vacancy performs a standard , symmetric random walk . in the vicinity of the tp",
    ", the vacancy jump direction probabilities are perturbed by the tp asymmetric hopping rules .",
    "hence , the random walk executed by the vacancy can be thought off as a particular case of the so - called `` random walk with defective sites '' ( see ref.@xcite for more details ) , or as a realization of the `` random walk with a hop - over site '' @xcite .",
    "a standard approach to define the properties of the tp random walk would be to start with a master equation determining the evolution of the whole configuration of particles .",
    "in doing so , similarly to the analysis of the tracer diffusion on 2d lattices in the presence of a finite vacancy concentration ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) , one obtains the evolution of the joint distribution @xmath68 of the tp position @xmath69 and of the vacancy position @xmath70 at time moment @xmath1 . the property of interest , i.e. the reduced distribution function of the tp alone will then be found from @xmath68 by performing lattice summation over all possible values of the variable @xmath70 .",
    "here we pursue , however , a different approach , which has been first put forward in the original work of brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite ; that is , we construct the distribution function of the tp position at time @xmath1 directly in terms of the return probabilities of the random walk performed by the vacancy .",
    "the only complication , compared to the unbiased case considered by brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite , is that in our case ten different return probabilities would be involved , instead of three different ones appearing in the unbiased case .",
    "hence , the analysis will be slightly more involved .",
    "we begin by introducing some basic notations .",
    "let    * @xmath67 be the probability that the tp , which starts its random walk at the origin , appears at the site @xmath38 at time moment @xmath1 , given that the vacancy is initially at site @xmath71 .",
    "* @xmath72 be the probability that the vacancy , which starts its random walk at the site @xmath71 , arrives at the origin @xmath73 for the first time at the time step @xmath1 .",
    "* @xmath74 be the conditional probability that the vacancy , which starts its random walk at the site @xmath71 , appears at the origin for the first time at the time step @xmath1 , being at time moment @xmath75 at the site @xmath44 .",
    "further on , for any time - dependent quantity @xmath76 we define the generating function of the form : @xmath77 and for any space - dependent quantity @xmath78 the discrete fourier transform @xmath79 where the sum runs over all lattice sites .    now , following brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite , we write down directly the equation obeyed by the reduced probability distribution @xmath67 ( cf ref.@xcite for a study of the joint probability of the tp position and of the vacancy position in the unbiased case ) : @xmath80 next , using the definition of the generating functions and of the discrete fourier transforms , eqs.([l ] ) and ( [ y ] ) , we obtain the following matricial representation of the generating function of the tp probability distribution : @xmath81 in eq.([p ] ) the function @xmath82 stands for the determinant of the following @xmath83 matrix , @xmath84 where the matrix @xmath85 has the elements @xmath86 defined by @xmath87 explicitly , the matrix @xmath85 is given by @xmath88 where the coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath90 , stand for @xmath91 i.e. are the generating functions of the conditional probabilities for the first time visit of the origin by the vacancy , conditioned by constraint of the passage through a specified site on the previous step . note that , by symmetry , @xmath92 for @xmath93 and @xmath94 as a result of such a symmetry , we have to consider just ten independent functions @xmath95 ( note that in the unbiased case one has to deal with only three such functions @xcite ) .",
    "explicit expression of the determinant in eq.([d ] ) in terms of these generating function is presented in the appendix .",
    "lastly , the matrix @xmath96 in eq.([p ] ) is given by @xmath97 the property of interest - the tp probability distribution function , will be then obtained by inverting @xmath98 with respect to the wave - vector @xmath99 and to the variable @xmath100 : @xmath101 where the contour of integration @xmath102 encircles the origin counterclockwise .    finally , we remark that as far as we are interested in the leading large-@xmath1 behavior of the probability distribution @xmath103 only , we may constrain ourselves here to the study of the asymptotic behavior of the generating function @xmath98 in the vicinity of its singular point nearest to @xmath104 .",
    "we notice that similarly to the unbiased case , this point is @xmath105 when @xmath106 . as a matter of fact , such a behavior stems from the _ a priori _ non - evident fact that the vacancy , starting from a given neighbouring site to the origin , is certain to eventually reach the origin .",
    "this will be demonstrated explicitly in section 4 ( cf .",
    "eq.([recurrence ] ) ) ; as a matter of fact , one can see from eq.([recurrence ] ) and the explicit representation of @xmath107 presented in the appendix that @xmath108",
    ". in consequence , expansion in powers of a small deviation @xmath109 has to be accompanied by a small-@xmath110 expansion , exactly as it has been performed in ref.@xcite .",
    "as we have already remarked , the vacancy random walk between two successive visits of the lattice site occupied by the tp can be viewed as a standard , two - dimensional , symmetric random walk with some boundary conditions imposed on the four sites adjacent to the site occupied by the tp . in order to compute the return probabilities @xmath111 for such a random walk ,",
    "we add , in a usual fashion @xcite , an additional constraint that the site at the lattice origin is in absorbing state .",
    "then , the vacancy random walk can be formally represented as a lattice random walk with site - dependent probabilities of the form @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the site occupied by the vacancy at the time moment @xmath1 , @xmath114 denotes the target , nearest - neighboring to @xmath113 site , @xmath115 where @xmath116 is defined , according to eqs.([45]),([46 ] ) and ( [ zzo ] ) , by @xmath117 further on , we define @xmath118 as the probability distribution associated with such a random walk starting at site @xmath119 at step @xmath120 .",
    "now , let the symbols @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 define the following three events :    * the event @xmath121 : the vacancy , which has started its random walk at the site @xmath44 , visits the origin @xmath73 for the first time at the @xmath1-th step exactly , being at the site @xmath124 at the previous step @xmath125 ; * the event @xmath122 : the vacancy , which started its random walk at the site @xmath44 , is at the site @xmath124 at the time moment @xmath125 and the origin @xmath73 has not been visited during the @xmath125 first steps of its walk ; * the event @xmath123 : the vacancy jumps from the neighboring to the origin site @xmath124 to the site @xmath73 at the @xmath1-th step exactly .",
    "evidently , by definition , the desired first visit probability @xmath126 is just the probability of the @xmath121 event @xmath127 to calculate @xmath128 we note first that the probabilities of such three events obey : @xmath129 on the other hand , we have that @xmath130 and @xmath131 hence , in virtue of eqs.([99]),([z]),([zz ] ) and ( [ zz1 ] ) , the return probability @xmath126 is given explicitly by @xmath132 therefore , calculation of the return probabilities @xmath111 amounts to the evaluation of the probability distribution @xmath118 of the vacancy random walk in the presence of an absorbing site placed at the lattice origin",
    ". such a probability distribution will be determined in the next subsection .      making use of the generating function technique adapted to random walks on lattices with defective sites @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we obtain @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath137 being the generating function of the unperturbed associated random walk ( that is , symmetric random walk with no defective sites ) .",
    "further on , eq . ( [ pasmatricielle ] ) can be recast into the following matricial form : @xmath138 in which equation @xmath139 stand for the @xmath140 matrices with the elements defined by @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "using next an evident relation @xcite : @xmath143 and the symmetry properties of a standard random walk , one can readily show that :    * for @xmath144 and @xmath145 , @xmath146 * for @xmath144 and @xmath147 , @xmath148 * for @xmath149 , @xmath150    consequently , the matrices @xmath151 and @xmath152 in eq.([matricielle ] ) are given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 with @xmath156 note that eqs.([aa ] ) and ( [ pp ] ) now define the @xmath157 matrix explicitly , and hence , define the generating function of the probability distribution @xmath133 .",
    "as we have already remarked , here we constrain our consideration to the analysis of the leading in @xmath1 behavior ; this amounts to consideration of the leading in the limit @xmath158 behavior of the corresponding generating functions .",
    "expanding @xmath159 and @xmath160 in the vicinity of the singular point @xmath161 , ( cf refs.@xcite and @xcite ) , we have @xmath162 and @xmath163 consequently , we find by solving the matricial equation ( [ matricielle ] ) , that the generating functions of the return probabilities obey @xmath164 where @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are some rational fractions ( all listed explicitly in the appendix ) , while @xmath168 it follows from eqs.([mm ] ) and explicit expressions for @xmath89 presented in the appendix , that , in particular , the generating functions of the return probabilities fulfil : @xmath169 which relations imply that the vacancy , starting its random walk from a given , neighbouring to the origin site , is @xmath170 to return eventually to the origin .",
    "in this section , we proceed as follows : taking advantage of the asymptotical expansion obtained in the previous section , we first determine the small @xmath109 behavior of the generating function @xmath98 , accompanied by the small-@xmath110 expansion .",
    "next , we evaluate the generating function of the tp mean displacement , by differentiating the obtained asymptotical expression for @xmath98 with respect to the components of the wave - vector , and analyse its large-@xmath1 behavior .",
    "lastly , we invert the asymptotical expansion of the generating function @xmath98 and obtain the corresponding probability distribution @xmath171 in a certain scaling limit .      using the explicit representation of the determinant @xmath82 in eq.([d ] ) in terms of the generating functions of the return probabilities @xmath89 , presented in the appendix , as well as the asymptotical expansions in eq.([mm ] )",
    ", we find that in the vicinity of @xmath172 and for small values of the wave - vector @xmath99 , @xmath82 is given by @xmath173 where we have used the shortenings @xmath174 @xmath175 @xmath176 and @xmath177 and assumed , for simplicity , that the starting point @xmath71 of the vacancy random walk is @xmath178 . on the other hand , we find that @xmath179 consequently , in the small-@xmath110 limit and @xmath180 , the generating function @xmath98 obeys @xmath181 where the coefficients @xmath182 are all functions of the field strength @xmath183 and of the temperature only .      as a matter of fact , the leading large-@xmath1 asymptotical behavior of the tp mean displacement can be obtained directly from eq.([v ] ) , since the generating function of the tp mean displacement , i.e. @xmath184 obeys ( see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) : @xmath185 consequently , differentiating the expression on the right - hand - side side of eq.([v ] ) with respect to the components of the wave - vector @xmath110 , we find that the asymptotical behavior of the generating function of the tp mean displacement in the vicinity of @xmath186 follows @xmath187 further on , using the discrete tauberian theorem ( cf .",
    "ref.@xcite ) and eq.([alpha ] ) , we find the following general force - velocity relation for the system under study @xmath188 which shows that the tp mean displacement grows @xmath21 with @xmath1 . in consequence , one may claim that the typical displacement along the @xmath39 direction scales as @xmath189 as @xmath8 . on the other hand , typical displacement in the @xmath40-direction is expected to grow only in proportion to @xmath190 , as in the unbiased case @xcite .",

    "exchanges with the charged tp are governed by the same rules as described in section 2 .",
    "note that , of course , when many vacancies are present , it may appear that two or more vacancies occupy adjacent sites or have common neighboring particles , in which case their random walks will interfere .",
    "however , as noticed in @xcite , these cases contribute only to @xmath248 and thus go beyond our approximation ; hence , we discard such possibilities here .",
    "now , let @xmath249 denote the probability of finding at time moment @xmath1 the tp at position @xmath38 as a result of its interaction with all @xmath245 vacancies collectively .",
    "further on , let @xmath250 denote the probability of finding the tp at site @xmath251 at time moment @xmath1 due to interactions with a vacancy initially at @xmath252 in a system with a @xmath35 vacancy . then , assuming that the vacancies contribute independently to the tp displacement , one has , following ref.@xcite : @xmath253 upon averaging over all initial vacancy configurations , and denoting this average by the angular brackets , we have @xmath254 which , in the limit of very small vacancy concentration , simplifies to @xcite : @xmath255    now , defining the fourier transformed distributions @xmath256 and @xmath257 and performing the corresponding summations , we find that @xmath258 turning next to the limit @xmath259 ( while the ratio @xmath260 is kept fixed ) , we obtain @xmath261 where @xmath262 @xmath263 @xmath264 are conditional return probabilities , defined in section 3 , and @xmath265 is the fourier transformed single - vacancy probability distribution @xmath266 .",
    "the latter can be readily obtained by applying the discrete fourier transformation to the relation @xmath267 and chosing @xmath268 .",
    "further on , using the results of the previous section , we find that in the limit @xmath213 , @xmath269 , the generating function of @xmath270 is given by @xmath271 with @xmath272 we turn next to calculation of @xmath273 in the limit @xmath213 , @xmath269 , which can be done rather straightforwardly by taking advantage of the results of section 3 .",
    "we have then @xmath274 where @xmath275 is the @xmath276 basis vector , @xmath277 denotes the transposition of @xmath275 , and @xmath278 is the vector , whose elements are @xmath279 , @xmath280 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath281    further on , using an evident symmetry relation @xmath282 as well as the relation in eq.([h ] ) , we obtain @xmath283 then , combining eqs.([80 ] ) , ( [ 81 ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) , ( [ aa ] ) , ( [ gg ] ) , and performing some straightforward but cumbersome calculations , we find that in the limit @xmath213 and @xmath269 , the sum @xmath273 is given by @xmath284 which is , remarkably , independent of @xmath285 and @xmath286 in the leading in @xmath100 order .",
    "consequently , in the limit @xmath213 and @xmath269 , the generating function @xmath287 obeys : @xmath288 next , using the discrete tauberian theorem , we obtain from the latter equation that in the limit @xmath8 and @xmath269 , @xmath289 finally , inverting eq.([ppp ] ) with respect to the wave - vector , @xmath290 and taking advantage of eq.([ll ] ) , we find that the leading , large-@xmath1 behavior of the tp mean displacement is given by @xmath291 i.e. grows linearly with time .",
    "this signifies that the tp mobility attains a constant value at sufficiently large times @xmath1 , @xmath292",
    "lastly , on comparing eq.([mobb ] ) and the result of brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite for the tp diffusivity in absence of the field , eq.([diff ] ) , we notice that again the einstein relation is fulfilled !",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of a charged tracer particle diffusing on a two - dimensional lattice , all sites of which except one ( a vacancy ) are filled with identical neutral , hard - core particles .",
    "the system evolves in discrete time @xmath1 , @xmath293 , by particles exchanging their positions with the vacancy , subject to the condition that each site can be at most singly occupied .",
    "the charged tp experiences a bias due to external field @xmath0 , which favors its jumps in the preferential direction .",
    "we determine exactly , for arbitrary strength of the field @xmath41 , the leading large-@xmath1 behavior of the tp mean displacement @xmath2 , which is not zero here due to external bias , and the limiting probability distribution of the tp position .",
    "we have shown that the tp trajectories are anomalously confined and its mean displacement grows with time only logarithmically , @xmath294 as @xmath8 .",
    "on comparing our results with the earlier analysis of the tp diffusivity @xmath4 in the unbiased case by brummelhuis and hilhorst @xcite , we have demonstrated that , remarkably , the einstein relation @xmath5 between the diffusivity and the mobility @xmath7 of the tp holds in the leading in @xmath1 order , despite the fact that both @xmath4 and @xmath7 tend to zero as @xmath8 .",
    "note , however , that validity of the einstein relation for the system under study relies heavily on the proper normalization of the vacancy transition probabilities ( see , eqs.([45]),([46 ] ) and ( [ zzo ] ) ) . in absence of such a normalization , artificial `` temporal trapping '' effects may emerge , which will result ultimately in the violation of the einstein relation for the system under study ( see also refs.@xcite and @xcite for physical situations in which such type of effects is observed ) .",
    "further on , we have also generalized our approach to the situation with small but finite vacancy concentration @xmath9 , in which case we have found a ballistic - type law of the form @xmath295 .",
    "we have shown that here , again , both @xmath4 and @xmath7 calculated in the linear in @xmath9 approximation do obey the einstein relation .",
