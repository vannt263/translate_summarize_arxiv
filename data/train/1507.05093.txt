    "the variation with @xmath129 in the sm - like higgs mass is about 3  gev , but the singlet is very sensitive to the value of the top mass : its mass can change by about 10 gev , and the different codes predict masses that differ from each other by several .",
    "in addition , for @xmath130  gev nmssmtoolsruns into the landau pole and is not able to calculate the spectrum .",
    "the situation can be even more dramatic when taking for instance the benchmark points proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite : for each of the three points bp1bp3 , at least two codes do not produce an output . when they are forced to produce an output ( for instance by ignoring tachyonic states which appear at tree - level )",
    ", the differences between the codes can reach 2030  gev for the light singlet .",
    "points with very large @xmath7 at the susy scale are attractive since they seem to soften the susy fine - tuning problem @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath7 is too close to the perturbativity limit , the output produced by the spectrum generators has to be taken with some care : these points can be very sensitive to small variations of the input parameters .",
    "changing the sm input parameters within their respective uncertainties  or changing the details of the determination of the running couplings  can lead to a completely different spectrum , or even result in the spectrum generator classifying the parameter point as unphysical .",
    "we have discussed the differences in the predictions for the scalar higgs masses and mixings by public spectrum generators for the nmssm .",
    "it has been shown that sizeable discrepancies can show up for various parameter points , but the origins of those discrepancies are fully understood .",
    "the main sources of discrepancies are in the approach used to calculate the running parameters that enter the higgs - mass calculation .",
    "the most important parameter here is the top yukawa coupling .",
    "further discrepancies arise from the different accuracy of the two - loop corrections included in the codes .",
    "this has important consequences for phenomenological studies : for mssm - like points , flexiblesusy , nmssmtools , softsusyand sphenousually agree quite well with each other , while nmssmcalcreturns in general a smaller value for the sm - like higgs boson mass .",
    "the main reasons for this discrepancy are the value of @xmath131 at @xmath108 , which is always smaller in nmssmcalc , and the inclusion of the mssm results for the @xmath132 corrections in flexiblesusy , nmssmtoolsand softsusybut not in nmssmcalc . for mssm - like points ,",
    "the mssm results provide a good approximation to the calculation implemented in spheno which includes the nmssm specific effects . on the other hand",
    ", this approximation usually fails for large values of @xmath7 and/or if light singlet states are present . in these cases , the results of flexiblesusy , nmssmtoolsand softsusyhave to be taken with care because it might be that the mssm approximation has even the wrong sign compared to the full nmssm calculation @xcite . for these cases spheno , with the additional nmssm specific contributions ,",
    "is expected to provide the most reliable prediction , with the caveat that if states in the loop become very light , the calculation can be plagued by intrinsic problems of the effective - potential calculation @xcite .",
    "nmssmcalc , on the other hand , is the only code that includes two - loop @xmath133 corrections to @xmath134 , which become non - negligible for large values of @xmath7",
    ".    it has been demonstrated with one example , that the differences can be much more pronounced for gut scenarios with values of @xmath7 close to the perturbativity limit .",
    "the differences in the threshold calculations among the codes can cause huge discrepancies in particular for light singlets and the predicted masses can differ by 10  and more .    in general",
    ", comparing the predictions of different codes may provide a ballpark indication for the theoretical uncertainty of the higgs mass calculation .",
    "however , even if these codes agree very well , one should not necessarily assume that the uncertainty is small : it is known from the mssm that spectrum generators performing a @xmath0  calculation ( softsusy , spheno , suspect @xcite ) can agree quite well , while sizeable differences to the os calculation of feynhiggs exists .",
    "the differences are assumed to come from the missing electroweak corrections and momentum dependence at two - loop level as well as from the dominant three - loop corrections .",
    "these are the effects that underlie the often - quoted estimate of a 3  gev uncertainty for the sm - like higgs mass in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "to get an estimate of the remaining theoretical uncertainty in the nmssm , a comparison between different renormalization schemes will therefore be necessary .",
    "this is deferred to future work , when further publicly available codes will have implemented os renormalization .",
    "however , even the validity of such an estimate is under discussion already in the mssm , in particular for a heavier susy scale of 2 tev and larger .",
    "calculations based on the effective field theory approach , which become valid in this mass range , usually predict a sm - like higgs mass that is lower by a few gev compared to the prediction from dedicated tools for the mssm @xcite .    with this work",
    "an important first step has been taken to understand the large differences in the higgs mass computations of the various public nmssm codes .",
    "for the investigated codes these differences are now completely understood and it has been shown that discrepancies of more than 3  gev are not unusual taking into account the different corrections implemented . to further pin down the residual theoretical uncertainty",
    "the next natural step will be to extend this investigation to the comparison of different renormalization schemes .",
