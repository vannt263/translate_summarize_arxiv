    "galaxy interactions are common at the present epoch .",
    "nearby examples are the magellanic - clouds  milky - way ( e.g. @xcite ) and the sagittarius - dwarf - galaxy  milky - way @xcite systems .",
    "galaxy interactions were much more common in the past though , and the milky way probably carries some scars from a more active past .",
    "evidence for this is the probable existence of the thick disc @xcite as well as probable tidal debris in the halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the number and strength of collisions of the milky way with small companion galaxies remains to be quantified .",
    "interesting limits are provided by the metallicity distribution of halo stars @xcite and the longevity of halo phase - space structure @xcite .",
    "the suspected tidal debris surrounding the milky way consists of individual globular clusters and nine known dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellite galaxies , which are approximately aligned on a few great circles .",
    "their masses ( @xmath0 , e.g. @xcite ) are too small for dynamical friction in an extended galactic dark halo to significantly affect their distribution over a hubble time .",
    "their orbital distribution must be primordial , apart from orbital precession in a possibly non - spherical dark halo ( e.g. @xcite ) .    inferring the genesis of the dsph satellites is of greatest importance .",
    "their kinematical , structural and photometric properties can be interpreted to imply that these small ( @xmath1  kpc ) and very faint ( @xmath2 ) collision - less stellar systems are completely dark - matter dominated , in which case they ought to be relics from early cosmic structure formation .",
    "the alternative interpretation is that the dsph satellites are remnants of galaxies without dark matter , apart from burned - out stars @xcite .",
    "such remnants arise naturally after removal of roughly 99  per cent of the stars through periodic tidal harassment , if their orbital eccentricities are large ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the proper motion of two dsph satellites has been measured recently @xcite . however , present estimates of orbital eccentricities are , unfortunately , too inaccurate to exclude the alternative interpretation , because the combined uncertainties in proper - motion measurements and in the mass distribution of the milky way are too large ( e.g. @xcite ) . for recent reviews on the dark matter",
    "content of dsph galaxies see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both interpretations have significant implications for the nature of dark matter .",
    "the former would imply that large amounts of dark matter ( @xmath4 ) must be containable within the tight phase - space limits defined by the dsph satellites .",
    "the latter interpretation is consistent with the absence of dark matter in reasonably well - understood dynamical systems that are smaller in extend than a few  kpc .",
    "examples of such systems are the galactic disc ( e.g. @xcite ) and star clusters .",
    "globular clusters contain about the same number of stars as dsph satellites , but they can not be their precursors .",
    "this is because the metallicity distribution and the star - formation history are irreconcilably more complex in dsph satellites ( e.g. @xcite ) . also , globular clusters with @xmath5 stars and half - light radii @xmath6  pc are stable against tidal destruction over a hubble time because their tidal radii are @xmath7  pc , even if the perigalactic distance is @xmath8  kpc @xcite .",
    "the precursor of a dsph satellite must , if this latter interpretation is correct , have ( i ) essentially no dark matter , ( ii ) @xmath9 stars for significant tidal de - population within a hubble time to leave a recognisable _ remnant _ , ( iii ) a characteristic radius roughly comparable to the tidal radius at peri - galacticon for susceptibility to tidal damage , and ( iv ) an apparently complex star - formation and metal - enrichment history . such a system is _ collision - less _ , because the half - mass relaxation time is longer than a hubble time .",
    "can such a dwarf galaxy be created naturally ?",
    "the hint provided by the significantly non - isotropic distribution of the galactic dsph satellites may be the key to the answer @xcite .",
    "theoretical computations that shed light on the formation of satellite galaxies in tidal tails are discussed in section  [ sec : mods ] .",
    "observational evidence is presented in section  [ sec : obs ] , and section  [ sec : concl ] contains the conclusions .",
    "tidal tails are pulled out from galaxies if these are tidally disturbed .",
    "the length and mass of the tidal tails depend on the strength of the interaction and on the mass and extend of the dark halos surrounding the interacting galaxies @xcite .",
    "dwarf galaxies , with masses @xmath10 , are expected to form within tidal tails , because only objects with such masses can become gravitationally unstable towards collapse during a sufficiently strong galaxy interaction that churns up the stellar and gaseous velocity dispersions @xcite .",
    "also , the interaction of gas - rich tidal tails with the inter - galactic medium may lead to gravitational instabilities near the ends of tidal tails @xcite .",
    "the tidal field of the merged or merging galaxies also limits the mass of self - gravitating tidal - tail clumps .    _ if _ , _ how _ and _ where _ tidal tails produce self - gravitating clumps is an extremely hard question to study theoretically because of computational limitations .",
    "the largest number of particles that can be used to represent a disc galaxy is , at present , roughly @xmath11 .",
    "grid methods in principle allow more particles , but are not so well suited for the simulation of non - planar tidal deformations that can extend over distances larger by orders - of - magnitude than the thickness of the unperturbed galaxy s disc .",
    "the particle density along a tidal tail is small , and it is difficult to asses if the condensations that form within the computer tails are physical or merely artifacts that result from local poisson fluctuations and swing amplification ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "gas plays a major role in the formation of self - gravitating objects in tidal tails , because dissipation forces the gas to accumulate near the centre of a gravitational instability thereby enhancing it and leading to star - formation",
    ". however , the numerical treatment of hydrodynamics is a serious challenge , and usually recourse to simple but computationally tractable approximations is required .",
    "@xcite use a combined n - body and smooth - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) code to model self - consistently two colliding milky - way - type disc galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are each represented by about 37000 stellar and 8000 sph particles .",
    "the trajectory is initially parabolic with a pericenter distance of 8  kpc , and the discs are not co - planar . extended tidal features develop after the first encounter .",
    "the relative orbit decays due to dynamical friction between the dark halos and the galaxies meet again about 380  myr after the first passage .",
    "coalescence occurs approximately 500  myr after the first passage , but the tidal tails continue expanding . in the expanding tidal tails , @xcite count 23  bound condensations that contain at least 12  particles ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the objects condense at distances larger than about 40  kpc from the merged galaxies .",
    "the most massive of these consists of about 360  particles , has a half - mass radius of 760  pc and a mass of approximately @xmath12 , 25  per cent of which is in the form of gas that is more centrally concentrated than the stellar particles .",
    "less than 5  per cent of the mass of this object is in the form of dark matter from the parent galaxy s halo .",
    "@xcite use a two - dimensional n - body and sticky - particle code .",
    "a self - consistent particle and gas disc is embedded in a rigid bulge and dark halo potential .",
    "about 63000 stellar particles and 31000 sticky particles represent the disc .",
    "the perturber is approximated by a point mass with the same mass as the galaxy , and is allowed to pass by in the disc plane on a hyperbolic orbit with a pericenter distance of about 20  kpc .",
    "tidal tails form quickly and wrap up in the inner parts of the disc where the gas particles sink to the centre . in the outer parts of the disc",
    "the tidal arms expand .",
    "the overall appearance is strikingly similar to the hubble space telescope images of the antennae galaxies @xcite .",
    "many self - gravitating objects condense in the stretching tidal arms , the most massive of which consists of about 250  gas particles with a mass of about @xmath13 .",
    "this object is composed mostly of gas , with old stellar particles contributing only about 40  per cent .",
    "further simulations show that in order for tidal - tail condensations with masses of about @xmath14 to form , perturber masses of at least about 20  per cent of the galaxy mass are needed .",
    "however , it may be possible that less massive tidal - tail condensations develop for even smaller perturbers in simulations with higher resolution .",
    "the authors estimate that the mass of the perturber should be about 1.4  times the mass of the galaxy for the outer - most tidal - tail condensations to be expelled into inter - galactic space .    that the tidal debris , including the freshly assembled dwarf galaxies , can end on bound eccentric orbits about the merged remnant galaxy is demonstrated by @xcite .",
    "that star - formation on dwarf - galaxy scales occurs in tidal tails has been known for some time . for example , @xcite show that a gas - rich dwarf galaxy appears to be forming about 100  kpc from the parent galaxy at the tip of one tidal tail in the antennae galaxies .",
    "this dwarf galaxy has a mass of about @xmath15 , as estimated from the hi gas content and from the velocity dispersion using 21  cm observations , and a diameter of about 15  kpc , and is actively forming ob  stars . in an r - band ccd imaging survey of 42  hickson compact groups ,",
    "@xcite find 42  candidate dwarf galaxies in tidal tails .",
    "these dwarfs have masses of @xmath16 estimated by assuming a mass - to - light ratio of unity , have diameters of a few kpc and lie at projected distances of a few tens of kpc from the parent galaxies .",
    "the authors estimate that such dwarf galaxies contribute significantly ( 3050  per cent ) to the number of dwarf galaxies in groups .",
    "further observational evidence for the formation of giant ( @xmath17 ) gas clouds in interacting galaxies is discussed by @xcite .    in their very interesting review of observational evidence for the formation of dwarf galaxies in tidal tails , @xcite also consider the metallicity  brightness correlation .",
    "bright galactic dsph satellites are more metal rich than faint satellites , and this correlation is also evident for elliptical galaxies and isolated dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that their sample of tidal dwarf galaxies does not exhibit this correlation .",
    "the tidal dwarfs are relatively metal rich ( approximately one third solar ) because they inherit the pre - enriched gas from the parent disc galaxy .",
    "interacting gas - rich disc galaxies expel tidal tails that may fragment at distances of many tens of  kpc from the parent galaxies .",
    "the formation of such tidal - tail fragments is now well documented in theory and by observation .",
    "the fragments are gas rich , and form massive stars hundreds of  myr after the interaction .",
    "self - consistent models with dark matter demonstrate that the dark matter content of such fragments is insignificant , and the simulations also suggest that the fragments are gravitationally bound objects .",
    "the masses of the fragments lie in the range @xmath18 and they have diameters of 110  kpc .",
    "galaxy interactions involving any mass ratio can lead to the formation of fragmenting tidal tails .",
    "however , only interactions involving two large galaxies , one of them by necessity a disc galaxy , will form massive star - forming tidal - tail condensations that may be expelled into inter - galactic space .",
    "the tidal - tail dwarf galaxies consist of a complex mixture of stellar populations .",
    "they are composed of stars born in the parent galaxy as well as of stars formed during the formation of the tidal tail condensation .",
    "complex self - enrichment is likely to occur , and it is perhaps possible that some episodic star formation over time - scales of gyrs may result if the tidal dwarf falls back towards the merger remnant thereby acquiring additional gas .",
    "such a bound tidal - tail dwarf galaxy will be repeatedly harassed by tidal forces , and will ultimately evolve to a dsph - like satellite .",
    "small isolated spheroidal galaxies , such as tucana , would be essentially without dark matter if they are tidal debris on unbound orbits .",
    "such systems should have small dynamical @xmath19 ratios .",
    "however , significant problems remain .",
    "it is unclear if the observed tidal - tail `` dwarf galaxies '' are really gravitationally bound objects once star - formation ceases .",
    "projects are under way with r. andersen and m. fellhauer to investigate if vigorous star formation and assembly in a tidal field can produce such systems .",
    "furthermore , it must be demonstrated that such aged dwarfs have sizes and masses that make them possible precursors of galactic dsph satellites , if the latter are to have been born in an early interaction of the milky way with some other galaxy . also , it is not clear if the early milky way could have suffered an interaction with another galaxy that was sufficiently strong to produce tidal arms , but not destructive of the galactic disc .",
    "the early gas - rich galactic disc may have reformed rapidly after such a perturbation , and the central bulge may have acquired mass from the radial gas flows during the interaction .",
    "furthermore , it must be shown that tidal debris remains bound to the milky way on orbits with eccentricities @xmath3 . finally , it is at present not clear how the observed correlation between brightness and metal abundance of the dsph satellites can be accounted for .",
    "metallicity - gradients in the early galactic disc and self - enrichment , in dependence of the tidal - dwarf galaxy s mass , may play a role , but the small masses make gas confinement difficult .",
