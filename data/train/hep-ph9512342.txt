    "considerable interest has been attracted in recent years to the issue of multiparticle production both in perturbative and non - perturbative regimes in weakly coupled scalar field theory ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "this problem has been initiated by the qualitative observation @xcite that in the ordinary theory with the action @xmath6 ( hereafter we set the mass of the boson equal to unity ) cross sections of the processes of creation of a large number of bosons by few initial ones exhibit factorial dependence on the multiplicity of the final state .",
    "the reason is that the number of tree graphs contributing to the amplitude to produce @xmath7 particles grows as @xmath8 . at @xmath9",
    "this factor is sufficient to compensate the suppression due to the small coupling constant , and the tree level multiparticle cross sections become large .",
    "now there is a lot of perturbative results ( see , for instance , @xcite ) which confirm the factorial growth of the tree level amplitudes , and , what is more important , exhibit the exponential behavior of multiparticle cross sections @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the energy of initial state . though practically all these results have been obtained in the perturbative regime @xmath13 , @xmath14 , one expects that the exponential behavior survives in the regime @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being fixed .",
    "moreover , there are strong indications @xcite that the exponent @xmath17 is universal , i.e. independent of the few - particle initial state .",
    "the exponential form of @xmath18 implies that for the calculation of the function @xmath17 there may exist a semiclassical method like the landau technique @xcite for calculating matrix elements in quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact , some approaches aiming to generalize the landau method have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "let us concentrate on the technique proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is based on singular solutions of some classical boundary value problem . as the result ,",
    "the function @xmath19 obtained by perturbative calculations @xcite has been reproduced by means of this way . in the @xmath20-space - time",
    "it looks like @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some known numericalconstant .",
    "moreover , certain new properties of @xmath23 have been obtained in different regimes .",
    "the given method is very promising since it allows one to study @xmath19 by the perturbative expansion or , in any case , to put this issue in the computer .    in this paper",
    "we study the behavior of @xmath19 in the regime @xmath24 with @xmath25 being fixed , i.e. in fact we will investigate only the energy dependence of the tree level cross sections .",
    "we present first few terms in the low energy expansion of @xmath23 in powers of @xmath26 ( up to @xmath27 ) . a lower bound on the function @xmath23 at any energies is obtained by numerical calculations .",
    "this bound seems to be larger than the estimate found by voloshin @xcite from the analysis of the feynman diagrams and coincides with the asymptotics at the high energies @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate also that in fact the function @xmath23 lies above this bound and does not coincide with it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.2",
    "we present a calculation of the boundary value problem for the tree level cross sections suggested in @xcite leading to the result which coincides with one obtained from the more general approach @xcite . in sect.3",
    "we find the @xmath28-correction .",
    "sect.4 is devoted to the proof that , at least in high energy limit , spherically symmetric solutions do not provide the true value of @xmath23 . in sect.5 some numerical results are presented . in sect.6",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "several technical details are collected in appendix .",
    "now with the aim to introduce our notations and to expose some points of the calculation we will briefly discuss the method suggested in @xcite .",
    "we will examine the cross section of the decay of one virtual particle at rest with the energy @xmath12 into @xmath7 real particles in the model ( [ 1 * ] ) .",
    "let us start from the coherent state representation ( see @xcite for details ) for the matrix element @xmath29 .",
    "in general , it has the form    @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 to calculate this matrix element at the tree level one should extremize @xmath33 over @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this extremization yields the classical field equation with the boundary conditions @xmath36 the solution to this equation , @xmath37 has only positive frequency parts due to the boundary conditions , and hence the action @xmath38 and the boundary term @xmath39 are reduced to zero .",
    "thus , the tree level matrix element is    @xmath40 and the amplitude @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 this result coincides with one obtained in @xcite from lsz - reduction formula .    according to the coherent state formalism",
    "the @xmath7-particle cross section can be easily found , @xmath43 where the integral over @xmath44 corresponds to the @xmath7-th derivative due to cauchy theorem . in order to estimate the integral ( [ 5 ] )",
    "the saddle point technique can be applied . to perform it correctly , however , one should look more carefully at @xmath45 and get rid of zero modes in @xmath45 corresponding to time shifts . one writes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the collective coordinate , and @xmath48 are new integration variables which obey a constraint to be spacified below .",
    "( of course , there are zero modes corresponding to the space shifts , but we do not write them explicitly since taking them into account leads only to spacial momentum conservation ) .",
    "so , eq.([5 ] ) becomes @xmath49 now , if one imposes a constraint that @xmath34 does not contain exponents and , so , may be considered as a pre - exponential factor , then this integral can be calculated by making use of the saddle point technique .",
    "the exact form of this constraint , which may be viewed as a constraint on @xmath50 , will be determined in what follows .",
    "therefore , the tree cross section is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the saddle point value of the functional @xmath53 with respect to @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath48 , and @xmath50 under an additional constraint which is yet to be defined .    in general",
    ", one expects that these classical solutions , being considered in euclidean space - time , have singularities on some surface @xmath56 .",
    "the leading behavior of the integral @xmath57 is determined by the nearest to the origin singularity of @xmath58 in the region @xmath59 .",
    "if this singularity is located at @xmath60 , then @xmath61 so , the constraint that @xmath34 may be considered as a pre - exponential factor requires @xmath62 .",
    "since we are working in the center - of - mass frame , the result should depend on @xmath63 , but not on its direction .",
    "so , in @xmath64-space we require @xmath65 spherical symmetry and finally the constraint is that @xmath58 has the singularity at @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the problem of finding the cross section at any value of @xmath12 and @xmath7 can be formulated in euclidean space - time and consists of the following steps ,    * one selects from all solutions @xmath68 to the euclidean field equation , @xmath65-symmetrical ones which are singular at @xmath69 and have the following asymptotics at @xmath70 , @xmath71 from them one finds fourier components @xmath48 and then determines @xmath72 from eq.([6 ] ) .",
    "* one should extremize @xmath72 over all @xmath48 , @xmath50 ( that is over different singular surfaces ) , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the tree level cross section is then given by the formula ( [ 6 * ] ) .",
    "now let us see that the extremum of @xmath72 at the fixed energy @xmath26 and @xmath7 is in fact its maximum .",
    "indeed , let us consider the functional @xmath75 this functional is bounded below , so it has a minimum at some value of @xmath48 ( at this point @xmath72 as a function of @xmath48 has its maximum ) , @xmath76 if one fixes some particular surface of singularities @xmath77 , than the obtained value of the functional @xmath78 for all values of @xmath73 .",
    "taking a saddle point value of @xmath74 , one gets @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 comparing @xmath82 and @xmath83 the following chains can be obtained @xmath84 @xmath85 therefore , if one fixes some class of surfaces of singularities and energy @xmath26 or , in other words , finds some particular singular solution , than one can get a lower bound for @xmath86 .    due to the nonlinearity of the field equations it is not possible to obtain an analytical solution to the boundary value problem formulated above .",
    "one can find , however , analytical solutions in several regimes .",
    "in this section we calculate @xmath19 to the accuracy of @xmath87 .",
    "the typical momentum of final particles at small @xmath26 is much smaller than the mass , so one can expect that the solution to the field equation @xmath45 is a slowly varying function of @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath88-independent solution having singularity at @xmath66 and decaying at @xmath70 can be found exactly @xcite , @xmath89 it corresponds , however , to the case of all final particles being at rest .",
    "let us modify this solution by imposing by hand dependence on @xmath64 .",
    "one writes @xmath90 this function has the surface of singularities @xmath91 . in the end",
    "we will extremize the functional @xmath72 , eq.([6 ] ) , with respect to @xmath92 . according to the general formalism described above , @xmath93 must vanish , and due to spherical symmetry @xmath92 depends only on @xmath94 . starting from this function ( which satisfies the field equation to the accuracy of @xmath95 )",
    "one can expand @xmath34 in the following way , @xmath96 where @xmath97 are of order of @xmath98 respectively .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath99 , @xmath100 can be found in appendix .    in order to obtain @xmath50",
    "corresponding to the solution , let us find the asymptotics of @xmath34 at @xmath70 ( see eq.([2* ] ) , @xmath101 ) , @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 this expression is of course the solution to the accuracy of @xmath105 to the linearized field equation which has the following general solution , @xmath106    let us introduce the notation @xmath107 thus , one gets , for any function of the form ( [ * ] ) , the following relation , @xmath108    assuming that @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , one can find from ( [ 3+ ] ) that to the accuracy of @xmath105 , @xmath112 comparing the terms of the same order in @xmath113 in eqs.([4 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) one finds for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116 to get these expressions we took into account that @xmath117 and due to the @xmath65 spherical symmetry , @xmath118 . from eqs.([4* ] ) and ( [ 4+ ] ) one finds the following system of the equations for @xmath119 and its derivatives at @xmath120 , @xmath121 @xmath122 from this system one can easily find all the derivatives of @xmath123 with respect to @xmath64 at @xmath67 via the derivatives of @xmath119 , @xmath124 substituting these solutions into the first equation of ( [ 5 ] ) one gets the constraint on @xmath119 , @xmath125 from ( [ 3** ] ) and ( [ 5 * * ] ) one obtains @xmath126 @xmath127 let us now to extremize ( [ 6 ] ) taking into account the constraint ( [ 5*** ] ) .",
    "making use of the lagrange multiplier method , we rewrite ( [ 6 ] ) in the following form @xmath128 where the constant @xmath129 should be determined .",
    "now @xmath72 can be variated with respect to @xmath50 without any restrictions .",
    "performing this procedure one gets @xmath130 where @xmath131 assuming @xmath132 , from ( [ 6* ] ) and ( [ 6** ] ) one obtains the equation for @xmath133 , @xmath134 let us now concentrate on the equation ( [ 6+ ] ) .",
    "first of all we consider the case @xmath135 . due to the fixed parity of the integrand , @xmath136 ( no summations over repeated indices ) . from the last equation one concludes that @xmath137 .",
    "together with eq.([6+ ] ) , this leads to @xmath138 @xmath73 is assumed to be large at small @xmath26 since , in fact , @xmath139 .",
    "the constant @xmath129 can then be found from the constraint ( [ 5*** ] ) by making use of eqs.([6* ] ) and ( [ 7* ] ) : @xmath140 where @xmath141",
    "so , one finally obtains the expression for @xmath48 , @xmath142 @xmath143 the variation of the functional ( [ 6 ] ) with respect to @xmath74 yields to @xmath144 from ( [ 8** ] ) @xmath74 can be found as a function of @xmath73 and @xmath7 .",
    "the variation of ( [ 6 ] ) with respect to @xmath73 gives the equation for @xmath73 , @xmath145 @xmath73 is seen to be indeed large at small @xmath26 .",
    "collecting ( [ 8 ] ) , ( [ 8** ] ) , and ( [ 8*** ] ) one finally gets for the function @xmath72 @xmath146 the first three terms in this expression coincide with those obtained in @xcite and the last term is an @xmath147 correction to @xmath72 .",
    "particularly , at @xmath148 , @xmath72 has the form @xmath149    finally , the last thing which is interesting to be performed is the calculation of @xmath150 which corresponds to the obtained @xmath48 ( [ 8* ] ) . to do it , one can find all derivatives of @xmath150 at @xmath151 ( see ( [ 5* ] ) ) and after that restore @xmath150 as the taylor s series in powers of @xmath94 .",
    "so , using the definition of @xmath119 ( [ 3** ] ) , expression for @xmath48 ( [ 8* ] ) , and taking into account that due to spherical symmetry @xmath152 one finds @xmath153 all derivatives of @xmath123 can be easily found from eqs .",
    "( [ 5* ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , @xmath154 thus , the singularity surface which corresponds to the cross section up to @xmath28 is a paraboloid , @xmath155 the eq.([10* ] ) is valid for values of * x * being smaller than the typical inverse momentum of the final particles , @xmath156 . it is worth noting that the term of order @xmath157 vanishes",
    ". these results are useful to compare with numerical calculations ( see sect.5 ) .",
    "let us now turn to the opposite limit , @xmath158 . in this case one can neglect the mass term in the field equation and consider the massless theory .",
    "since euclidean massless @xmath159 theory is conformally invariant , several solutions can be found analytically .",
    "the simplest one is @xmath160 symmetric lipatov s instanton @xcite .",
    "the corresponding solution which is singular at @xmath69 can be easily constructed @xcite by making the size of the instanton pure imaginary and shifting its center : @xmath161 the variational procedure on @xmath73 , @xmath74 and only collective coordinate @xmath162 ( clearly , no collective coordinates describing the shape of the singularity surface appears ) could be made and results in ( see @xcite ) @xmath163 however , the variation on the shape of singularity surface is still required , unless the result ( [ wkhl ] ) provides only lower bound for the true exponent .    to see that these @xmath160 symmetric calculations in fact do not provide the extremum over the shape of singularities , let us consider the small perturbations about the solution ( [ khl ] ) . since the solution should be @xmath65 symmetric with respect to @xmath64 rotations , it is sufficient to consider the approximate solutions which slightly vary the singularity surface so that the dependence of @xmath164 , an angle between the @xmath165 axis and the radius vector , appears .",
    "the solution should have the form @xmath166 in this equation , @xmath167 are gegenbauer polynomials , @xmath168 are small parameters , and the linear fluctuations @xmath169 should satisfy the following equation , @xmath170 \\tilde{\\varphi}_m(r)=0\\ ] ] to solve this equation , one can exploit the conformal invariance of the model and use the stereographic projection onto the sphere @xmath171 ( it is a convenient way to solve the equations in the conformal models , we use here a slightly modified method of @xcite ) . skipping the details ,",
    "the solution is @xmath172 calculating the asymptotics of this solution , one obtains the following expression for @xmath48 : @xmath173 ( here @xmath174 corresponds to the solution ( [ khl ] ) ) .",
    "then the exponent after the variational procedure on @xmath73 and @xmath74 is modified by @xmath175 for @xmath176 or @xmath177 ( which corresponds to the dilatations and translations of @xmath178 ) , @xmath179 . however , for all other values of @xmath180 the perturbation in the exponent is proportional to @xmath168 , so that the functional derivative of the exponent calculated at @xmath160-symmetric solution with respect to collective coordinates describing the shape of the singularity surface is non - zero .",
    "so , the result ( [ wkhl ] ) is indeed only lower bound on the tree cross sections in high - energy limit .",
    "one could expect that for lower energies ( massive theory ) this property will be conserved .",
    "so , to obtain a lower bound for @xmath181 at given @xmath12 and @xmath7 one could consider @xmath160 symmetric field configurations @xcite .",
    "the singularity surfaces are then three - spheres in euclidean space , and the only variational parameter is the radius of a sphere , @xmath162 .",
    "since the singularity surface should touch the origin , the sphere should be centered at @xmath182 i.e. , the @xmath160 symmetric solution has the general form @xmath183 at large @xmath184 , the solution tends to the exponentially falling solution to the free field equation , @xmath185 i.e. , at @xmath70 one has @xmath186 where the coefficient function @xmath187 is to be determined by solving the field equations under the condition that it has a singularity at @xmath188 . from this asymptotics",
    "one finds @xmath189 the  action  ( [ 6 ] ) is then expressed through @xmath187 , so @xmath72 reads @xmath190    now we extremize eq.([w ] ) with respect to @xmath162 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "this leads to the following equations which determine the saddle point values of these three parameters , @xmath191    @xmath192    so , we look for the classical solutions which are singular at the spheres @xmath193 and from their asymptotics obtain @xmath187 , then express saddle point values of @xmath162 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 through @xmath12 and @xmath7 ( by making use of the eqs .",
    "( [ 7  ] ) , ( [ 5 * * * ] ) ) and finally obtain the estimate for the exponent for the tree cross section ( see eq.([6 * ] ) ) @xmath194    fig .  1    it is straightforward to perform this calculation numerically for all @xmath26 .",
    "the exponent for the cross section has the form @xmath195 with the function @xmath196 plotted in fig.1 . at low energies",
    "our result matches the perturbative results , eq.([9* ] ) .",
    "the fact that our variational approach leads to the exact results for @xmath197 at small @xmath26 can be understood as follows . at small @xmath26 , the curvature of the singularity surface",
    "is always large , and only this curvature is relevant for the evaluation of @xmath196 @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the surface of singularities has the form ( see eq.([10* ] ) ) , @xmath198 and only the leading term is important at small @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , this leading term can be reproduced exactly in our @xmath160 symmetric ansatz , and our result is exact at small @xmath26 . at very high energies ( small values of @xmath162 )",
    "our field configuration tends to the @xmath160 symmetric solution of the massless equations , eq.([khl ] ) .",
    "so , at @xmath199 it approaches the lower bound derived from this solution .",
    "the alternative lower bound on @xmath196 can be easily read out from ref .",
    "@xcite and it is also shown in fig.1 . this bound has been obtained by direct analysis of diagrams .",
    "as one can see from fig.1 , our bound is stronger than that of ref .",
    "to summarize , the tree multiparticle cross sections can be calculated using a semiclassical method based on singular solutions to classical field equations . at low kinetic energies @xmath26 of particles in the final state",
    "the corresponding solutions can be obtained analytically and the leading exponent in the cross section can be found at least up to @xmath28 . instead of proceeding to higher orders in @xmath26",
    ", one can solve the field equations numerically for different surfaces of singularity and after that apply the variational procedure at arbitrary @xmath26 .",
    "for the simplest form of the singularity , the spherically symmetric one , the variational procedure over collective coordinates is incomplete and provides a lower bound on the tree cross section ( the correct result at tree level should correspond to the true maximum of the exponent ) . to improve this estimate , one should consider more general field configurations . beyond the tree level , the semiclassical landau - like methods are still applicable , but the variational procedure is more complicated and corresponding solutions are known only in the simplest case of zero energies .",
