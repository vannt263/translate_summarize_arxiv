    "the first light of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has marked the beginning of a new era of high - energy collider physics .",
    "this actualizes the concept of not only proton - proton collisions , but also what kind of physics could be probed in other high - energy collisions exploiting proton energies similar to the lhc ones . at the same time , it is the hope that new colliders will not only probe the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking and the stabilization of the electroweak scale , but also trace and identify the source of other known shortcomings of the standard model ( sm ) , such as the existence of neutrino masses and dark matter . in the case of neutrino masses , the most popular scenario is generally considered to be the type - i seesaw models  @xcite and it has already been shown that low - scale realizations  @xcite of such models can give observable signals in collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "one of the most striking predictions of the type - i seesaw is that neutrinos are majorana particles and thus , that lepton number is broken through their majorana mass terms .",
    "one of the most promising probes of the majorana nature of neutrinos is the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) , which would produce a distinct peak at the end of the double beta decay spectrum ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "any search for processes violating lepton number will typically have a signal suppressed by the tiny neutrino masses  @xcite . while in low scale seesaw mechanisms this smallness is due to a cancellation of different large contributions , this very same cancellation will suppress any lepton number violating signal unless the energy probed in the process is such that some particular contributions are enhanced or suppressed due to kinematics . in @xmath0 searches , contributions from neutrinos with masses above the nuclear scale of @xmath1 mev",
    "are suppressed with respect to those below ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) and the cancellation can be avoided . here",
    "we will discuss the prospects of observing the manifestly lepton number violating processes @xmath2 .",
    "similar to @xmath0 , the contributions of mass eigenstates above the energy probed by the colliders will be suppressed , evading the cancellation behind the small neutrino masses .",
    "moreover , collider experiments , and proton - lepton colliders in particular can , unlike @xmath0 searches , produce these neutrinos on - shell via s - channel contributions with the consequent enhancement of the signal .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : low - scale ] , we review the low - scale seesaw model and summarize the current bounds .",
    "we then go on to discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : lnv ] , within the low - scale seesaw model , the lepton number violating processes that constitute our signal .",
    "section  [ sec : numerics ] is dedicated to providing the details of our numerical computations , while in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] we present the results . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , we summarize our results and give our conclusions .",
    "let us consider the lagrangian of the standard type - i seesaw model , which consists of the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian plus an extra piece containing the allowed couplings between the sm fields and additional gauge singlet fermions ( _ i.e. _ , right - handed neutrinos ) @xmath3 : @xmath4\\ ; .\\ ] ] here , @xmath5 denotes the sm higgs field , which breaks the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry after acquiring its vacuum expectation value , @xmath6 . in this work",
    ", we will use the basis in which @xmath7 is diagonal with real positive entries .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , this produces a @xmath8 mass matrix @xmath9 where @xmath10 , in the basis @xmath11^t$ ] . in terms of the light mass eigenstates @xmath12 and the heavy eigenstates @xmath13 , the neutrino flavor eigenstates can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in the cases where the heavy neutrinos can be integrated out",
    ", this implies a non - unitary mixing matrix @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , for the light neutrinos  @xcite . inserting this relation into the electroweak interaction lagrangian",
    ", we obtain the following coupling between the heavy neutrinos and the charged leptons via the @xmath18 bosons @xmath19    the unitarity deviations implied by the heavy neutrinos can thus be used to constrain the elements of @xmath20 through the relation @xmath17 which implies @xmath21 at the 90  % confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "this constraint stems from the effects that such terms would have in universality tests of the weak interactions as well as the invisble width of the @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "notice that somewhat stronger bounds @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are obtained when measurements of @xmath26 from muon decay and the ckm unitarity are assumed  @xcite instead of the invisible width of the @xmath22 .",
    "the combination of both data sets would , however , result in a larger allowed region since their respective best fits do not coincide .",
    "indeed , while the invisible width of the @xmath22 prefers non - zero values of @xmath27 in order to accommodate the present @xmath28 deviation from the sm , such a result is not favored by the measuremets of @xmath26 . for definiteness",
    "we will fix here the size of the signal by accommodating the data on the invisble width of the @xmath22 , setting @xmath29 .",
    "however , the rescaling of the signal under study to smaller mixing angles is trivial through an overall quadratic dependence , as we will discuss later .",
    "if the masses of the heavy neutrinos display a moderate hierarchy , the signal will mainly be dominated by the contribution of the mass eigenstate within the reach of the collider energy . thus , in order to simplify the discussion , we will assume there is only one heavy neutrino contributing to the signal , while the other neutrinos , necessary for the generation of the observed pattern of masses and mixings at low energies , are heavier and do not contribute significantly .",
    "the mixing of this neutrino with the sm fermions will be set to @xmath30 as discussed above .",
    "note that , if we also impose the condition that neutrino masses are small while maintaining large yukawa couplings , then an additional constraint @xmath31 applies  @xcite . in particular",
    ", strong constraints on the product will then stem from processes such as @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , we will consider scenarios with only one @xmath33 , where the mixing is to only one flavour .",
    "thus , we will not consider lepton flavour violation in the signal but only lepton number violation .",
    "finally , it should be noted that @xmath0 decay searches in general provide strong bounds on @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to satisfy both the constraints from @xmath0 and bounds on neutrino masses while still maintaining large yukawa couplings  @xcite .",
    "here we will consider the process @xmath35 to investigate the possibility of producing the heavy right - handed neutrinos of the type - i seesaw mechanism and observe the lepton - number - violating signals associated to their majorana nature at colliders .",
    "the advantage of lepton - proton collisions with respect to purely hadron or lepton colliders is the cleanness of the signal . indeed , since the lepton number in the initial state is one , the observation of a charged antilepton in the final state is a clear signal of violation of lepton number by two units , as long as there is no missing energy .",
    "this last requisite translates in the presence of three jets in the final state , two of them reconstructing an invariant mass equal to the @xmath18 mass .",
    "conversely , lepton number violation in hadronic or @xmath36 colliders implies tagging two leptons of the same charge in the final state together with either the presence of missing energy in the form of neutrinos or a higher number of jets , making the signal more challenging to search for .    in the type - i seesaw ,",
    "two diagrams contribute to the signal under study ( see fig .  [",

    "the branching ratio for the first decay is roughly 25  %  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the production process is weighted by the mixing @xmath44 of the heavy neutrino @xmath45 with the charged lepton @xmath46 .",
    "thus , it is trivial to extend the analysis from the assumed values of the mixing angles of @xmath47 to smaller mixings by a general rescaling .",
    "the electron - proton process we discuss here was already studied in @xcite , mainly focusing on the desy experiment but also extended to a combination of lep and lhc .",

    "we also extend their analysis to the higher collider energies discussed in the lhcec proposal  @xcite , which results in an enhancement of the signal and sensitivity to higher neutrino masses .",
    "we have therefore extended the original analysis to a wider range of neutrino masses than initially considered and showed explicitly the dependence of the signal on the mediating neutrino mass .",
    "furthermore , we also explore for the first time more sophisticated collider technologies , such as muon - proton colliders , inspired by the recent efforts towards a muon collider ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent status review ) .",
    "this setup would allow to explore different matrix elements with respect to the electron - proton option , providing a completely independent search channel also with respect to @xmath0 searches .",
    "moreover , the energies that could be expected from such a facility imply a huge gain in sensitivity allowing to explore much smaller mixings or larger sterile neutrino masses than their electron counterparts . in both scenarios",
    "we will assume a detector setup based on the capabilities of atlas and cms .",
    "regarding possible sources of background , the manifest lepton number violating nature of the signal in absence of missing energy makes it very clean and difficult to mimic by sm processes .",
    "several sources of background were already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was found that , for the lepton number violating signal under study , the dominant background stems from @xmath18 production with its subsequent decay into the @xmath39 required for the signal .",
    "the original @xmath40 can be missed for example if it becomes a neutrino or is lost in the beamline .",
    "we have simulated and studied these two sources of background . in the second case",
    "the contribution to @xmath18 production is dominated by the exchange of an almost real photon with a very collinear outgoing electron . in order to compute this process , we have simulated a proton - photon collision and convoluted it with the photon pdf in a charged lepton .",
    "this turns out to be the dominant source of background , in particular when the two final state jets are produced by qcd processes . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this background was reduced by means of a cut in the invariant mass of the two jets in the final state @xmath48 compatible with that of a @xmath18 boson @xmath49 , complemented with a cut in the minimum transverse momentum of the outgoing @xmath39 ( @xmath50 ) . however , as we will show in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , the presence of neutrinos in the final state , necessary to produce the final state positron through sm processes , suggests also the use of cuts in missing transverse energy ( @xmath51 ) to suppress the background .",
    "we have found that cuts in maximum @xmath51 and minimum @xmath50 actually provide a better signal / background ratio than those in @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , in the case of the @xmath52 background , two of the jets typically originate from a @xmath18 boson decay .",
    "thus , the invariant mass cut around @xmath49 will not avail to reduce this source of background .",
    "on the other hand , the cuts in maximum @xmath51 and minimum @xmath50 prove to be useful for this other background too .",
    "this extra cut in @xmath51 thus represents a very useful complementary tool to the cut in @xmath50 in order to reduce all sources of sm background .",
    "we base our numerical study of the signal and background on the use of the madgraph / madanalysis  @xcite software tools supplemented by pythia  @xcite and pgs  @xcite to process the resulting events . the type - i seesaw description for madgraph / madanalysis was obtained via the feynrules  @xcite software . for the protons we assume an lhc - like beam with an energy of 7  tev , while several different choices are examined for the lepton beam .",

    "we simulate instead the process @xmath55 convoluted with the pdf of a photon inside the charged lepton .    for each experimental setup ,",
    "we simulate the signal for the case of a heavy neutrino mass of @xmath56 , 500 , and 750  gev while setting the mixing to the value required to accommodate the invisible width of the @xmath22 : @xmath57 .",
    "this provides a quite optimistic signal , but the scaling of the results is trivial with @xmath44 , as previously discussed . for all cases ,",
    "we generate a total of @xmath58 events satisfying the acceptance cuts . at a later stage , after presenting the bare results of the simulation , we will implement additional cuts to reduce the background .",
    "the implementation of these cuts will be made at the madanalysis level .",
    "as we are discussing new physics searches , it is fundamental to distinguish between the signal and the sm background .",
    "thus , in order to increase the sensitivity of these searches , cuts which can suppress the background while not affecting the signal too adversely should be investigated .",
    "naturally , an expected background lower than one event would not be very worrisome and the constraining factor would then be one of the signal cross section .",
    "however , as the achievable luminosities for these speculative facilities are uncertain , we will present cuts designed to enhance the signal - to - background ratio regardless of the smallness of the cross section . for definiteness",
    ", we will assume a baseline integrated luminosity of @xmath59  fb@xmath60 and include this value in the plots for reference .",
    "indeed , this value is in the ballpark of the @xmath61  @xmath62s@xmath60 being discussed for the lhcec proposal  @xcite for its lower energy version . for a 150  gev electron beam",
    "the luminosity could be around an order of magnitude smaller .",

    "the major question is thus what separates the signal events from the background ones .",
    "a cut that has been previously studied in the literature is to reject events where the outgoing @xmath39 does not have a minimum transverse momentum .",
    "the reason for this cut to reject the background more strongly than the signal is that , while the signal is mainly due to on - shell heavy neutrinos , the background kinematics are such that the positron is predominantly emitted in the beam direction .",
    "since all of the sm backgrounds include at least one neutrino , which will constitute missing energy , while the signal only includes particles visible to the detector , another viable cut could be to impose an upper bound on the missing transverse energy of the accepted events .    in fig .",

    "the shape of the transverse energy distribution is similar for all @xmath68 in the area close to zero missing transverse energy , thus leading to a uniform behavior for the signal suppression .",
    "it should also be noted that even a very mild cut on the missing transverse energy would be enough to reduce the background by a factor of a few without noticeably affecting the signal and thus , at least a modest cut should be implemented in any analysis . for illustration , we will implement cuts of @xmath69  gev and @xmath70  gev .",

    "the two cuts are fairly independent and complementary in nature , since their combination provides a significant background reduction with respect to the implementation of only one of them . moreover , depending on the facility , luminosity and part of the parameter space that is being explored , some combination of the two would provide an optimal cut .",

    "we have discussed the prospects of testing the existence of heavy majorana neutrinos of a low scale type - i seesaw mechanism in lepton - proton collisions .",
    "the question of the majorana nature of neutrinos together with the origin of neutrino masses is one of the most fundamental issues still unsolved in particle physics .",
    "the quest for answers to these unknowns is particularly challenging since all probes testing the majorana character of neutrinos typically face a strong suppression of the signal due to the smallness of the active neutrino masses . in low scale seesaw mechanisms , however , this smallness originates from a cancellation between different large contributions that could , individually , lead to observable signals at searches such as @xmath0 decay or collider experiments .",
    "thus , if the mass spectrum of the heavy majorana neutrinos is such that some contributions are enhanced or suppressed by the kinematics of the process , the cancellation responsible for the smallness of neutrino masses will not take place .",

    "such a facility would not only allow to probe smaller mixings and higher neutrino masses through higher cross sections of the signal at higher energies , but also provide a complementary search channel , since it would probe areas of the parameter space completely independent to the electron - proton collisions or @xmath0 searches .    in order to simulate the signal ,",
    "we have set the mixing between the new heavy neutrinos and the charged leptons to the value required to accommodate the @xmath28 deviation of the invisible width of the @xmath22 with respect to the standard model prediction .",
    "even this optimistic assumption leads to a small signal , as expected from the challenging task of testing lepton number violation .",
    "we have shown that , despite the smallness of the expected cross section , the facilities under study would allow for an observable signal in areas of the parameter space still allowed by present data . moreover",
    ", the signal from these facilities is particularly clean , with a very small standard model background to obscure it .",
    "the dominant background is originated from @xmath18 production , with its subsequent decay into an @xmath39 and the original @xmath40 missed by the detector .",
    "nevertheless , we have studied how the signal over background ratio could be improved further through different kinematic cuts so as to allow the search of even smaller values of the mixing angle , provided sufficiently high collider luminosities . a conservative estimate of the sensitivity to the mixing between the heavy neutrinos and charged leptons yields an improvement of more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the present constraints for luminosities of @xmath75 fb@xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that lepton - proton colliders provide a particularly clean probe of the elusive majorana nature of neutrinos and the type - i seesaw mechanism and would complement other ongoing searches by exploring different parts of the allowed parameter space .",
