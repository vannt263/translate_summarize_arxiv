    "heavy ion collisions with radioactive nuclear beams provide a unique opportunity to study the properties of nuclear matter at the extreme condition of large isospin asymmetry @xcite . in these collisions , the dynamics",
    "is affected not only by the isospin - independent part of nuclear equation of state ( ) but also by the isospin - dependent part , i.e. , the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath0 , and the isospin - dependent in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( _ n_-_n _ ) cross sections . knowledge on the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is essential for understanding both the structure of radioactive nuclei @xcite and many key issues in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "although the root - mean - squared radius of neutron distribution in a heavy nucleus and that of a neutron star differ by about @xmath1 orders of magnitude , the properties of both systems are strongly affected by the same @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the nucleosynthesis in pre - supernova evolution of massive stars , mechanisms of supernova explosions , cooling rates of protoneutron stars and associated neutrino fluxes , and the kaon condensation as well as the hadron to quark - gluon plasma phase transitions in neutron stars all rely critically on the nuclear symmetry energy @xcite . however , our knowledge on @xmath2 is still rather poor despite extensive theoretical studies based on various many - body theories @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is often regarded as the most uncertain property of a neutron - rich matter @xcite .",
    "fortunately , radioactive beams , particularly the very energetic ones to be available at the planned rare isotope accelerator ( ria ) and the new accelerator facility at german heavy ion accelerator center ( gsi ) , provide a great opportunity to study the @xmath0 .",
    "it is thus important to investigate theoretically what experimental observables can be used to extract information about @xmath0 . in this",
    "regard , significant progress has been made recently .",
    "for instance , measurement of neutron skins of radioactive nuclei via their total reaction cross sections @xcite or that in stable heavy nuclei , such as @xmath3pb , via parity - violating electron scatterings hor01 was recently proposed as a sensitive probe to @xmath4 . in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei , the pre - equilibrium neutron / proton ratio @xcite , isospin fractionation fra1,fra2,xu00,tan01,bar02 , isoscaling in multifragmentation @xcite , proton differential elliptic flow @xcite , neutron - proton differential transverse flow @xcite as well as the @xmath5 to @xmath6 ratio @xcite have been identified as promising probes .",
    "observables mentioned in the above involve only the momentum , charge , and mass distributions of individual particles in the final state of a reaction . on the other hand , two - particle correlation functions , through final - state interactions and quantum statistics effects , have been shown to be a sensitive probe to the temporal and spatial information about the reaction dynamics in heavy ion collisions at incident energies ranging from intermediate @xcite to rhic energy @xcite . in particular , the correlation function of two nonidentical particles from heavy ion collisions has been found to depend on their relative space - time distributions at freeze out and thus provides a useful tool for measuring the emission sequence , time delay , and separation between the emission sources for different particles geld95,lednicky96,voloshin97,ardouin99,pratt99,gourio00 .",
    "indeed , time delays as short as @xmath7 and source radius differences of a few tenth have been resolved experimentally from correlation functions of nonidentical particles @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we study systematically how @xmath2 affects the temporal and spatial structure of reaction dynamics in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei at intermediate energies .",
    "a brief report of present work can be found in ref .",
    "we show that average emission times of neutrons and protons as well as their relative emission sequence in heavy ion collisions are sensitive to @xmath8",
    ". a stiffer density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy leads to faster and nearly simultaneous emissions of high momentum neutrons and protons .",
    "consequently , strengths of the correlation functions for nucleon pairs with high total momentum , especially neutron - proton pairs with low relative momentum , are stronger for a stiffer @xmath2 .",
    "this novel property thus provides another possible tool for extracting useful information about @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we also study how two - nucleon correlation functions depend on the isospin - independent part of nuclear matter , the in - medium _ n_-_n _ cross sections as well as the impact parameter , incident energy , and masses of colliding nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ symmetry ] , we discuss the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy and the of neutron - rich nuclear matter .",
    "the isospin - dependent boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( ibuu ) transport model used in present study is briefly described in section [ ibuu ] . in section [ source ] , we presented results from the ibuu model on the nucleon emission functions and their isospin dependence in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei at intermediate energies .",
    "these include the nucleon emission times , the size of nucleon emission source , and the momentum distributions of emitted nucleons . in section",
    "[ correlation ] , we study nucleon - nucleon correlation functions and their dependence on the nuclear symmetry energy . we also present results on the variations of the symmetry energy effects on nucleon - nucleon correlations with respect to the nuclear isoscalar potential , nucleon - nucleon cross sections , as well as the impact parameter , incident energy , and masses of heavy ion collisions . finally , we conclude with a summary and outlook in section [ summary ] .",
    "many theoretical studies ( e.g. , wir88,lat91,siemens70,baym71,prak88,thor94 ) have shown that the of asymmetric nuclear matter can be approximately expressed as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the baryon density ; @xmath11 is the isospin asymmetry ; and @xmath12 is the energy per particle in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the bulk symmetry energy is denoted by the so - called symmetry energy coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "its value at normal nuclear matter density @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath15 , is predicted to be about @xmath16 and is comparable to the value extracted from atomic mass data @xcite .",

    "the theoretically predicted values for @xmath23 vary from about @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( e.g. @xcite ) , while data from giant monopole resonances indicate that @xmath22 is in the range from @xmath26 mev to @xmath27 depending on the mass region of nuclei and the number of parameters used in parameterizing the incompressibility of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "there are no experimental data for the value of @xmath19 , and different theoretical models give its value from @xmath28 to @xmath29 @xcite .    predictions for the density dependence of @xmath2 are thus divergent . in the present study , we adopt the parameterization used in ref .",

    "it is seen that the stiff symmetry energy gives a larger pressure in asymmetric nuclear matter than the soft one at same density , and the difference increases with both density and isospin asymmetry .",

    "although the total incompressibility of asymmetric nuclear matter is mainly determined by the stiffness of the isoscalar part of nuclear energy , the stiffness of symmetry energy has non - negligible effects on its and thermodynamical properties .",
    "we thus expect that different symmetry energies would lead to different space - time evolutions in heavy - ion collisions induced by neutron - rich nuclei at intermediate energies , resulting in observable effects in the nucleon - nucleon correlation functions .",

    "the momentum distribution of emitted nucleons is also given .",

    "the emission times of different particles in heavy ion collisions are relevant for understanding both the collision dynamics and the mechanism for particle production . in heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies , the dynamics of nucleon emissions",
    "is mainly governed by the pressure of the excited nuclear matter produced during the initial stage of collisions lis , pawel . since the stiff symmetry energy gives a larger pressure than that due to the soft symmetry energy as shown in fig .",

    "the difference in neutron and proton emission times is particularly large for the soft symmetry potential as its magnitude at densities below the normal nuclear matter density , where most nucleons are emitted , is larger than that of stiff symmetry potential as seen in fig .",
    "since the stiff symmetry potential changes sign when nuclear density drops below @xmath73 , the relative emission sequence of neutrons and protons in this case depends on the average density at which they are emitted .",
