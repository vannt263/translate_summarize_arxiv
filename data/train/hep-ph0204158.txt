    "the standard model gives highly successful descriptions of hadronic physics in terms of the basic force .",
    "yet its key parameters , the masses of the quarks and leptons are specified by the coupling of the higgs bosons , which is undetermined .",
    "it is possible that the dynamics of the fundamental gauge theories themselves generate the masses of all the matter fields , or in other word , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( for quarks ) , which corresponding to the absence of the low mass scalar partners of the @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the appropriate theory for describing the strong interaction at high energy .",
    "however , the lack of observation of free quarks and gluons leads to the assumption of colour confinement that only quantities which transform as colour singlets can be physical observable .",
    "one may expect that the nonperturbative infrared behaviour of gluon propagator which may lead to a linear or oscillator potential implements confinement , however , till now , all theoretical studies based on qcd can not give satisfactory explanation .",
    "hence we take an equivalent statement that the propagator of a colored state should have no singularities on the real time - like @xmath1 axial , the absence of kallen - lehmann spectral representation precludes the existence of free quarks @xcite .",
    "in fact , dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement are two crucial features of qcd , however , they correspond to two very different energy scales .",
    "the possible interplay of the two dynamics lies in the following two facts , the first one is that on large energy scale the chiral massive quark interacts with antiquark via a confining potential and creates a new quark mass , constituent quark mass ; while the second one can be attributed to the double role of the @xmath0 , as both nambu - goldstone boson and @xmath4 bound state .    the schwinger - dyson equation , in effect the functional euler - lagrange equation of quantum field theory , provides a natural framework for investigating the nonperturbative properties of quark and gluon green s functions .",
    "by studying the evolution behaviour and analytic structure of the dressed quark propagator , one can obtain valuable information about the dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon and confinement .",
    "although lattice calculations are rigorous in view of qcd , they suffer from lattice artifacts and uncertainties , such as gribov copies , boundary conditions and so on .",
    "furthermore , current technique can not give reliable result below @xmath5 , where the most interesting and novel behaviour is expected to lie .",
    "it would seem therefore that at the present time schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation is the most reliable tool for studying the infrared behaviour of the quarks and gluons propagators in the continuum limit , while it has its own shortcomings .",
    "the flat - bottom potential ( fbp ) is a sum of yukawa potentials , which not only satisfies gauge invariance , chiral invariance and fully relativistic covariance , but also suppresses the singular point which the yukawa potential has .",
    "it works well in understanding the meson structure , such as electromagnetic form factor , radius , decay constant @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to examine dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement with the fbp .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : in section 1 , introduction ; in section 2 , infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator ; in section 3 , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ; in section 4 , quark confinement ; in section 5 , flat bottom potential and schwinger - dyson equation ; in section 6 , conclusion and discussion .",
    "the infrared structure of the gluon propagator has important implication for quark confinement .",
    "one might expect that the behaviour of the quark interaction in region of small spacelike @xmath1 determines the long range properties of the @xmath4 potential and hence implements confinement .    from the discussion of previous section",
    ", we can see that the sd equation is the ideal tool for studying the infrared behaviour of the gluon propagator .",
    "here we make a brief skeleton of the results based on landau gauge and axial gauge studies .",
    "it is impossible to solve an infinity series of coupled sd equations for gluons and quarks ( ghosts ) , so the authors have to make truncations both in landau gauge and axial gauge . in those studies ,",
    "the quark loop contributions are neglected and higher order vertexes are taken as bare or dressed based on the analysis of corresponding ward - takahashi identity .    in axial gauge studies ,",
    "one makes further assumption that the dressed gluon propagator has the same tensor structure as the free one . that is in the following equations",
    "let @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 here @xmath8 is gauge parameter and n is an arbitrary four vector . after solving gluon sd equation one get the conclusion that the gluon propagator may have a double pole at the origin , implying an area law behaviour of the wilson loop , which is often regarded as a signal of confinement @xcite .",
    "further more , the fourier transform of the time - time component of the gluon propagator is related to the one - gluon exchange contribution to the potential between static colour charge and a @xmath9 infrared behaviour does generate a linearly rising potential at large distance @xcite .",
    "however , a general studies of the properties of the spectral representation of the gluon propagator in axial gauge show that the coefficient of the @xmath10 term can not be more singular then @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that neglecting the @xmath12 term is a poor approximation because there maybe cancellation in the infrared between @xmath13 and @xmath12 .    in landau gauge studies",
    "suppose neglecting ghost loop will not remove the dominant infrared contributions in qcd also leads to a @xmath9 behaviour for the gluon propagator in the origin .",
    "other studies suggest that fermion loop may suppress the infrared singularity in the gluon propagator , the double pole found in the pure - gauge sector may be removed by the nonperturbative fermion loop corrections @xcite .",
    "recently , the gluon sd equation studies including ghost loop result in a infrared vanished gluon propagator and a strong infrared enhanced ghost propagator @xcite while lattice calculations support this type conclusion @xcite .",
    "in fact , the truncations applied in these studies may impair their persuasion .",
    "furthermore , in some studies of this type , unphysical particle - like singularities occur in the dressed ghost - gluon and 3-gluon vertices and the infrared vanished gluon propagator can neither produce dynamical chiral symmetry breaking nor compliment confinement @xcite .",
    "we can take a simple example by analyzing the renormalization group equation for the coupling constant",
    ". there exists a competing mechanism between the self - interaction of gauge boson and the interaction of boson - fermion , which accounts for the different evolution behaviours of the coupling constants with momentum for qcd and qed @xcite .",
    "so neglecting one another may lead to very different results .",
    "all theoretical studies based on qcd are suffered from shortcomings in one or another way @xcite , so they can not give satisfactory infrared behaviour for gluon propagator which may lead to a linear or oscillator potential implements confinement .    here",
    "we take an alternate description of confinement based on the analytic structure of the dressed quark propagator , if the quark green s function is free of singularities on the real timelike @xmath1 axial , then denies the existence of a single particle spectrum and precludes free quarks .",
    "although by no means a sufficient condition for the formulation of finite size @xmath14 states , it is an essential ingredient in describing of confinement based on a bold assumption that interaction between dressed quarks which does not rise to infinity at large distance .",
    "the interaction between dressed quarks may diminish at separation beyond the characteristic length scale at which point the quark green s function approaches its vacuum values , but the vacuum s repulsive force due to the absence of a mass pole in the dressed quark propagator again compresses the quarks together .",
    "so the traditional model of confinement based on an effective rising potential can be interpreted as the result of combination of the repulsive interaction between quark - vacuum and the attraction of dressed quark - quark with increasing separation .",
    "although there maybe a long way to go before the repulsive quark - vacuum interaction can be quantified , this description has proven successful in the formulation of a confining nontopological soliton model for baryons @xcite . in this article",
    ", the quark propagator calculated with the fbp does free singularities on the real timelike @xmath1 axial and implements quark confinement .",
    "the ultraviolet stability of qcd at large spacelike momentum makes a straightforward definition of the chiral limit possible , in a manifest contrast to strong coupling qed , whose rigorous definition remains an instructive challenge .",
    "the @xmath0 decay constant @xmath15 is an important parameter in describing the interplay between dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement , while the quark condensate serves as an order parameter for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . in the chiral limit ,",
    "the @xmath0 plays a double role both as nambu - goldstone boson and @xmath14 bound state , which lead to the result that the scalar part of the inverse dressed quark propagator coincides with the approximated @xmath0 s bethe - salpeter function . in the following ,",
    "we calculate the @xmath0 decay constant , the quark condensate and examine the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking phenomenon .      neglecting ghost , the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) for quark - gluon vertex in the presence explicit quark masses can be written as @xcite : @xmath16 + 2im \\gamma_{5}(p',p ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the limit of exact chiral symmetry , the wti reduces to @xmath17 note that the usual perturbative isovector axial vector vertex is @xmath18 .    in the chiral limit and take @xmath19 , the axial vector quark vertex becomes completely dominated by the pseudoscalar coupling of a massless @xmath0 to the quark and the subsequent weak decay of the @xmath0 into an axial vector current .",
    "in fact , the mass shell residue of the axial vector quark vertex ( @xmath20 ) is the @xmath0 bethe - salpeter @xmath21 amplitude , in the chiral limit can provide a direct connection to the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath22 contains many dirac structures , such as @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 and regular term , singular term . exclude the singular term @xmath21 , the other terms are supposed to give small contributions and neglected .",
    "if we solve the schwinger - dyson equation for the vertex , we can see their relative weights . in the chiral limit",
    ", the @xmath30 component of @xmath31 makes a good approximation , though it has many dirac structures , such as @xmath30 , @xmath32 and so on . the @xmath0 decay constant @xmath15 is defined by the axial transition amplitude for the on - shell @xmath0 ,    @xmath33    when @xmath19 , we obtain @xmath34 multiplying eq.(5 ) with @xmath35 on both sides , @xmath36 when combined with eq.(3 )",
    ", we obtain the goldberger - treiman relation for the quark - pseudoscalar vertex , @xmath37 the simplest generalization of eq.(7 ) is @xmath38    based on above discussion , it is possible to obtain an expression for @xmath39 from the integral equation for the @xmath0 decay constant .",
    "@xmath40    as usual , the factor @xmath41 on the right hand side arises from the quark loop .",
    "we need to take the axial - vector vertex as a perturbative one in order to avoid double counting .",
    "the expression for @xmath42 can be written as @xmath43    in the limit @xmath44 , we can recover the pagels and stokar formula @xcite .",
    "our numerical results based on the quark propagator obtained from the sd equation studies with the fbp do give satisfactory result @xmath45 , we can thus fit the parameters in the fbp .",
    "there is another expression for the @xmath0 decay constant which determined from global colour model @xcite .",
    "@xmath46   -s[\\sigma_{s } \\sigma''_{s}-\\sigma'^{2}_{s}]-s^{2}[\\sigma_{v } \\sigma''_{v}-\\sigma'^{2}_{v}]\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 in our calculation .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is far from 1 , we prefer eq.(10 ) rather than eq.(11 ) , as eq.(11 ) is exact only in the limit @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the quark propagator is defined as @xmath50|0 \\rangle   .\\ ] ] where q(x ) is the quark field and t the time - ordering operator . for the physical vacuum",
    "consists of both perturbative and nonperturbative parts , so the quark propagator s(x ) can be divided into a perturbative and a nonperturbative part as the following : @xmath51 in the nonperturbative vacuum , the normal - ordered product @xmath52 does not vanish .",
    "the widely used nonlocal quark condensate @xmath53 is given by the scalar part of the fourier transformed inverse quark propagator , @xmath54 in the limit @xmath55 , we can obtain the expression for the local quark condensate , @xmath56 in ref.@xcite the nonlocal condensate is put in the following form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the vacuum non - locality of the nonlocal quark condensate .",
    "the nonlocal properties of the vacuum condensates are of principal importance in the study of the distributions of quarks and gluons in hadrons @xcite .",
    "physically , it means that the vacuum condensates of quark and gluon can flow through the vacuum with nonzero momentum .",
    "the effects from hard gluonic radiative corrections to the quark propagator are connected to a possible change of the renormalization scale @xmath59 at which the condensates are defined .",
    "those effects are of minor importance for the nonperturbative effects in the low and medium energy regions , and neglected in our studies . in this article , we take the rain - bow sd equation , so it is not a renormalizable interaction . as isolated closed quark loop integral , the quark condensate has only one energy scale , the momentum cut off , @xmath59 , at which the quark condensate is defined . in our studies , the energy scale @xmath59 is implicitly determined by the effective gluon propagator , we can use eq.(16 ) as the definition for the quark condensate .",
    "however , presently , the nonperturbative technique can not prove the relation @xmath60 at low energy scale . here",
    "@xmath61 is the anomalous dimension and takes the value @xmath62 .    if we take the limit @xmath63 and assume ultraviolet dominating , the above relation @xmath64 is indeed the case , although the quark condensate is only defined at low energy scale",

    ", the evolution of quark condensate with @xmath59 can be determined from gell - mann - oakes - renner relation and renormalization group equation , @xmath68 if we take into account the hard radiative corrections to the quark propagator , there is a more nature definition for the quark condensate ( in euclidean space time ) @xcite : @xmath69 in the second definition , we can take the cut off be @xmath70 , however , at large momentum , the quark propagator approximates its asymptotic free form which should be subtracted . from fig.1",
    ", we can see that the cut off @xmath71 makes a sound approximation .    in this article",
    ", @xmath59 is taken to be 1 @xmath72 . if we ignore the hard radiative corrections to the quark propagator , from eq.(16 )",
    ", the numerical result gives the quark condensate @xmath73 .",
    "if we take into account the hard radiative corrections , from eq.(21 ) , we obtain : @xmath74 all our numerical results are compatible with the results of the qcd sum rule approach , and large enough to give dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the definition of eq.(21 ) is better .",
    "to demonstrate that quark confinement arises from the absence of singularities on the real timelike @xmath1 axial , let us first make an observation on the large euclidean time behaviour of the free fermion propagator @xcite .",
    "@xmath75    the spatially averaged schwinger function is a particularly insightful tool .",
    "consider the fermion propagator and let @xmath76 represent euclidean time , then @xmath77 hence the free fermion s mass can easily be obtained from the large t behaviour of the spatial average : @xmath78 this is just the approach used to determine the bound state masses in simulations of lattice qcd .    in order to demonstrate that the confinement of quarks , we have to study the mass function of the quark and prove that there no poles on the real timelike like @xmath1 axial .",
    "so it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation of the dressed quark propagator from euclidean space into minkowski space @xmath79 .",
    "however , we have no knowledge of the singularity structure of quark propagator in the whole complex plane",
    ". one can take an alternative safe procedure and stay completely in euclidean space avoiding analytic continuations of the dressed propagators @xcite .",
    "again we take the fourier transform with respect to the euclidean time t. it is sufficient to consider the scalar part @xmath80 , @xmath81 if s(p ) had a pole at @xmath82 , the fourier transformed @xmath83 would fall off as @xmath84 for large t or @xmath85 .    in our calculation , for large @xmath86 , the values of @xmath87 is negative , except occasionally a very very small fraction positive values which can be safely neglected .",
    "we can express @xmath87 as @xmath88 , @xmath89 is an odd integer .",
    "if we neglect the imaginary part , we find that when the euclidean time t is large , there indeed exists a crudely approximated linear function with respect to t , which is shown in fig.2 .",
    "however , such a behaviour is hard to acquire physical explanation . here",
    "the word crudely should be understand in the linearly fitted sense , to be exact , there is not linear function .",

    "we take landau gauge .",
    "this dressing comprises the notation of constituent quarks by providing a mass @xmath104 , which is corresponding to dynamical symmetry breaking . because the form of the gluon propagator @xmath105 in the infrared region is unknown ( as we have discussed in section 2 )",
    ", one often uses model forms as input in the previous studies of the rainbow sd equation @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we assume that a wick rotation to euclidean variables is allowed , and perform a rotation analytically continuing @xmath106 and @xmath107 into the euclidean region where them can be denoted by @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , one can derive the sd equation from the euclidean path - integral formulation of the theory , thus avoiding possible difficulties in performing the wick rotation @xmath110 .",
    "as far as only numerical results are concerned , the two procedures are equal .    the euclidean sd equation can be projected into two coupled integral equations for @xmath111 and @xmath112 . for simplicity , here ignore the bar on @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the dressed quark propagator exhibits a dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon and gives a constituent quark mass about 490 mev ( @xmath116 ) , which is larger then the value of commonly used constituent quark mass 350 mev in the chiral quark model .",
    "then based on dressed quark propagator , we obtain the quark condensate @xmath117 , the @xmath0 decay constant . the calculated @xmath15 and @xmath117 are compatible with experimental and theoretical works respectively .",

    "<S> in this article , we calculate the dressed quark propagator with the flat bottom potential in the framework of the rain - bow schwinger - dyson equation . then based on the nonperturbative dressed quark propagator </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the @xmath0 decay constant and the quark condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 decay constant is an important parameter in describing the interplay between dynamical symmetry breaking and confinement , while the quark condensate is an order parameter for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . to implement confinement , we prove that the dressed quark propagator has no poles on the real timelike @xmath1 axial , the absence of kallen - lehmann spectral representation obviously precludes the existence of free quarks .    </S>",
