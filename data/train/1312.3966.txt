    "quantitative statistical description of quasar variability is important both for understanding the physics of the driving mechanism(s ) , and for selecting quasars in imaging surveys .",
    "here we describe recent progress in the analysis of quasar variability which demonstrated that a stochastic process called damped random walk ( drw ) provides a satisfactory statistical description of quasar variability in the optical wavelength range .",
    "two main methods have been utilized over the last few decades to quantitatively describe stochastic quasar variability : a variability structure function analysis and direct modeling of light curves .",
    "the structure function as a function of time lag @xmath2 , sf(@xmath2 ) , is equal to the standard deviation of the distribution of the magnitude difference @xmath3 evaluated at many different times @xmath4 and @xmath5 , such that time lag @xmath6 ( and divided by @xmath7 because of differencing ; we warn the reader that a number of slightly varying definitions have been used in recent quasar studies ) . this operational definition has been applied to both light curves of individual objects and as an ensemble analysis tool that is applicable even when only two photometric measurements per object are available ( in this case it is typically assumed that quasars selected from narrow luminosity and redshift bins have statistically the same variability behavior ) .",
    "the time dependence of the structure function was found to be consistent with the prediction based on a damped random walk model ( macleod et al .",

    "thus a drw is equivalent to an ordinary random walk for @xmath10 ( the `` damped '' aspect manifests itself as sf(@xmath11 sf@xmath12 for @xmath13 ) .    the structure function is related to the autocorrelation function , which makes a fourier pair with the power spectral density function ( psd ) .",
    "the psd for a drw is given by @xmath14 therefore , a drw is a @xmath15 process at high frequencies , just as an ordinary random walk ( when @xmath16 , then @xmath17 ) .",
    "the `` damped '' nature is seen as a flat psd at low frequencies ( @xmath18 ) .",

    "the psd at long time scales ( @xmath22 ) follows @xmath23 , with @xmath24 ( top left panel , a mixture of a flicker noise and a random walk ) , @xmath25 ( bottom left , almost identical to a random walk ) and @xmath26 ( top right , similar to a drw ) .",

    ". observed light curves of quasars are consistent with @xmath27 , while @xmath28 is ruled out by sdss stripe 82 data .",

    "2012 ) . before summarizing the main results",
    ", we briefly review the statistical properties of a drw .",
    "the car(1 ) process , as it is called in statistics literature , for a time series @xmath31 is described by a stochastic differential equation which includes a damping term that pushes @xmath31 back to its mean ( see kbs09 ) .",
    "hence , it is also known as a drw in astronomical literature ( another often - used name is the ornstein  uhlenbeck process , especially in the context of brownian motion ) . in analogy with calling a random",
    "walk a `` drunkard s walk , '' a drw could be justifiably called a `` married drunkard s walk ''  who always comes home to his or her spouse instead of drifting away .",
    "stochastic light curves can be modeled using the covariance matrix . for a drw",
    ", the covariance matrix is @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and @xmath30 are model parameters ; @xmath35 controls the short timescale covariance ( @xmath36 ) , which decays exponentially on a timescale given by @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding autocorrelation function is @xmath37 .",
    "the asymptotic value of the structure function , sf@xmath12 , is equal to @xmath38 .",
    "a number of other convenient models and parametrizations for the covariance matrix are discussed in zu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "both a structure function analysis and the direct modeling of light curves demonstrate that a drw provides a good description of the optical continuum variability of quasars .",
    "for example , the time span of sdss data from stripe 82 is sufficiently long to constrain @xmath30 for the majority of the @xmath010,000 quasars with light curves ( macleod et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath30 and sf@xmath12 are correlated with physical parameters , as discussed in the next section .",
    "macleod et al . ( 2010 ) have concluded that the observed light curves of quasars are consistent with psd@xmath39 at long timescales , with @xmath27 , while @xmath28 is ruled out .",
    "furthermore , zu et al . (",
    "2012 ) have analyzed ogle light curves using a number of stochastic processes with covariance matrices similar to that for a drw .",
    "they concluded that the drw model is consistent with data on the probed time scales ( from a month to a few years ) .",
    "some deviations from the drw model were detected at short timescales ( a month or less ) by mushotzky et al .",
    "( 2011 ) using high - precision kepler data .",
    "they found that the measured psd at high frequencies ( from @xmath40 hz up to @xmath41 hz ) is steeper than the expected @xmath19 behavior .",
    "the distribution of magnitude differences drawn from a drw light curve should be gaussian .",
    "the number of points per observed light curve is typically too small to test this expectation using individual objects .",
    "when using an ensemble analysis , the observed distribution is puzzlingly closer to an exponential ( laplace ) distribution than to a gaussian distribution ( ivezi et al .",
    "2004 ; macleod et al .",
    ". nevertheless , macleod et al . (",
    "2012 ) showed that the exponential distributions seen in the statistics of ensembles of quasars naturally result from averaging over quasars that are individually well described by a gaussian drw process .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath30 and sf@xmath12 , determined using a drw model and sdss stripe 82 light curves , are correlated with physical parameters , such as the luminosity , black hole mass , and rest - frame wavelength ( macleod et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "their analysis shows sf@xmath12 to increase with decreasing luminosity and rest - frame wavelength ( as was observed previously ) , and without a correlation with redshift .",
    "they found a correlation between sf@xmath12 and black hole mass with a power - law index of @xmath42 , independent of the anti - correlation with luminosity .",
    "they also found that @xmath30 increases with increasing wavelength with a power - law index of 0.17 , remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity , and increases with increasing black hole mass with a power - law index of @xmath43 .",
    "the amplitude of variability is anti - correlated with the eddington ratio , which suggests a scenario where the optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretion rate , possibly in an inhomogeneous accretion disk ( dexter & agol 2011 ) .",
    "however , an additional dependence on luminosity and/or black hole mass was found that can not be explained by the trend with eddington ratio .",
    "recent studies show evidence for enhanced color variability compared to what is expected if the mean accretion rate is solely driving the variability ( schmidt et al . 2012 ) , which is consistent with a scenario involving hot spots in the disk .",
    "the last decade has seen enormous progress in both data availability and the modeling of stochastic quasar variability .",
    "the damped random walk model provides a satisfactory statistical description for practically all the data available at this time .",
    "this progress is likely to continue thanks to new post - sdss massive sky surveys .",
    "for example , the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; for a brief overview see ivezi et al .",
    "2008 ) will extend the light curve baseline for @xmath010,000 quasars from sdss stripe 82 to over 30 years , and will obtain an additional @xmath0800 high - precision ( @xmath00.01 mag ) photometric measurements .",
    "in particular , these data will enable a definitive robust measurement of the low - frequency behavior of the psd for quasar variability ."
