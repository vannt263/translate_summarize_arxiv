    "working with the bernstein basis throughout made this finding easier .",
    "the convexity condition on the full model in section  [ sect : characterization ] is obtained via intermediate polynomials ( @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) , so that the coefficients of the resulting pickands function @xmath6 are parameterized by those of @xmath187 and @xmath188 . in this parameterization , there is an identifiability problem with the parameters . to see this , in ( [ eq : h ] ) , take for example the four couples @xmath498 , @xmath499 , @xmath500 and @xmath501 , these will all produce the same function @xmath85 .",
    "however , for inferential purposes , the parameters of interest remain the coefficients of @xmath85 ( or @xmath6 ) , not the ones of @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the submodel is not concerned with this issue at all , the parameters of the submodel are the coefficients",
    ". the simplicity of this model , its polytopal parameter space , the gap theorem and its flexibility makes it more appealing , for us at least , than the full model in section  [ sect : characterization ] .",
    "a practical consequence of the simplicity of the submodel is in finding the maximum likelihood estimator ; it is more than twice as fast , numerically , than for the complete model .",
    "finally , we mention that although the likelihood is not concave ( and rather complicated ) , local maxima could indeed make difficult the search for a global maximum .",
    "however , using a state - of - the - art matlab  global search algorithm , we have not encountered problematic situations .",
