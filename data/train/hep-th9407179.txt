    "the existence of classical supersymmetric string theories in @xmath1 dimensions has been linked to the existence of the normed division algebras @xmath2 @xcite , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the algebras of the reals , complexes , quaternions , and octonions .",
    "one reason for this correspondence is the isomorphism @xmath11 on the lie algebra level @xcite .",
    "however , because of the non - associativity of the octonions , the extension of this result to finite lorentz transformations , i.e. , on the lie group level , for @xmath12 has posed a problem until recently @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , octonionic spinors based on @xmath13 have been used successfully as a tool to solve and parametrize classical solutions of the superstring and superparticle @xcite .",
    "another link between octonions and supersymmetric theories is given by the triality @xcite automorphisms of @xmath14 , which interchange the spaces of vectors , even spinors , and odd spinors .",
    "these automorphisms are constructed using the chevalley algebra , which combines these three spaces into a single 24-dimensional algebra .",
    "our formulation of the chevalley algebra in terms of @xmath15 octonionic hermitian matrices naturally extends to the exceptional jordan algebra .",
    "a variety of articles connect this algebra to theories of the superstring , the superparticle , and supergravity @xcite .",
    "division algebras are also used in the spirit of guts to provide a group structure that contains the known interactions @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to bring these many isolated observations together and place them on the foundation of the theory of clifford algebras .",
    "our framework allows an elegant unified derivation of all the previous results about orthogonal groups .",
    "the octonionic triality automorphisms , for example , are completely symmetric with respect to the spaces of vectors , even spinors , and odd spinors , as they should be .",
    "we explain new features and properties of octonionic representations of clifford algebras related to the possible choices of different octonionic multiplication rules .",
    "we also find that not all of the common constructions from complex representations have exact analogues for octonionic representations because of the non - commutativity of the octonions .",
    "for example , the octonionic analogue of the charge conjugation operation involves the opposite octonionic algebra , without which the transformation behavior is inconsistent . however , the extra structure of two distinguished octonionic algebras may turn out to be a feature of our formalism rather than a bug .    in a previous article @xcite a demonstration of the construction of @xmath16 , @xmath14 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18",
    "is given , which illustrates how the octonionic algebra works explicitly .",
    "however , in this article , we only use the general algebraic properties of the octonions , rather than rely on explicit computations involving a specific multiplication rule .",
    "this approach is taken to highlight the central role of the alternativity of the octonions in the development of our formalism .",
    "in essence , we suggest the division algebra of the octonions not as an afterthought , but as a starting point for incorporating lorentzian symmetry and supersymmetry in supersymmetrical theories . this principle is brought to fruition in a fully octonionic description of the triality automorphisms of the chevalley algebra .",
    "the content of this article is organized as follows : first we give a thorough introduction to composition algebras and the division algebra of the octonions .",
    "in particular , we devote a large part of section [ sec : octonions ] to the investigation of the relationship amongst different multiplication tables of the octonions . in section  [ sec : clifford ] we state basic concepts about clifford algebras and their representations .",
    "we characterize the clifford group and the orthogonal group of a vector space with a metric by generating sets .",
    "this approach turns out to be better adapted to octonionic representations than the usual lie algebra one .",
    "then we introduce the octonionic representation of the clifford algebra in 8-dimensional euclidean space in section  [ sec:8 ] . in section [ sec : other reps ] , the reductions to 7 and 6 dimensions and the extension to 9 + 1 dimensions are discussed . in section  [ sec : triality ] , we introduce an octonionic description of the chevalley algebra and show that the triality symmetry is inherent in the octonionic description . then , in section [ sec : full group ] , we briefly explain how our results with regard to sets of finite generators of lie groups are related to the usual description in terms of infinitesimal generators of the corresponding lie algebra .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] discusses our results .",
    "this section lays the first part of the foundation for octonionic representations of clifford algebras , namely it introduces the octonionic algebra . the first subsection deals with some general properties of composition algebras .",
    "a subsection introducing our convention for octonions follows .",
    "we then turn our attention to the relationship among different multiplication tables for the octonions and introduce the opposite octonionic algebra . for further information and omitted proofs",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a less rigorous approach is taken in @xcite .",
    "an algebra @xmath19 over a field @xmath20 is a vector space over @xmath20 with a multiplication that is distributive and @xmath20-linear : @xmath21 @xmath19 is also assumed to have a multiplicative identity @xmath22 .",
    "a composition algebra @xmath19 over a field @xmath20 is defined to be an algebra equipped with a non - degenerate symmetric @xmath20-bilinear form , @xmath23 with the special property that it gives rise to a quadratic norm form which is compatible with multiplication in the algebra : @xmath24 ( in the case of the octonions ( [ eq:8squares ] ) is known as the eight - squares theorem , i.e. , a sum of eight squares is the product of two sums of eight squares , and many applications rely on this identity . )",
    "two main consequences can be derived ( see @xcite ) from this essential property of composition algebras .",
    "firstly , these algebras exhibit a weak form of associativity : @xmath25 defining the associator as a measure of the deviation from associativity via @xmath26 then ( [ eq : alternative ] ) implies @xmath27 or ( by polarization ) @xmath28 i.e. , the associator is an alternating function of its arguments . this weak form of associativity",
    "is also called alternativity .",
    "( [ eq : alternating ] ) and ( [ eq : alternative ] ) are equivalent , if the characteristic @xmath29 of @xmath20 does not equal 2 , which is assumed from now on .",
    "as shown in @xcite alternativity implies the so - called moufang @xcite identities , @xmath30 which will turn out to be useful later on .",
    "secondly , composition algebras are endowed with an involutory antiautomorphism @xmath31 : @xmath32 ( obviously , we view @xmath20 as embedded in the algebra @xmath19 via @xmath33 , in particular @xmath34 . with this identification and ( [ eq : linear ] ) , multiplication with an element of @xmath20 is commutative , i.e. , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the center of @xmath19 . )",
    "we observe that @xmath31 is linear and fixes @xmath20 .",
    "( note that @xmath37 , since @xmath38 ) this antiautomorphism can be shown to provide a way to express the quadratic form @xmath39 : @xmath40 so all elements of @xmath19 satisfy a quadratic equation over @xmath20 : @xmath41 polarizing ( [ eq : normsq ] ) results in an expression for the bilinear form : @xmath42 we determine inverses : @xmath43 however , in order to solve a linear equation @xmath44 , we need @xmath45 . to see that we do indeed have associativity in this case , we need the following relationship , @xmath46 between the associator and the commutator @xmath47 which is defined as usual .",
    "so for @xmath48 , we see that products with elements in @xmath36 are associative : @xmath49 since the associator is linear in its arguments , we can put ( [ eq : inverse ] ) , ( [ eq : involution ] ) , and ( [ eq : f - assoc ] ) together : @xmath50 finally , we observe more general consequences of ( [ eq : involution ] ) and ( [ eq : f - assoc ] ) : @xmath51 which imply that both commutators and associators have vanishing inner products with 1 : @xmath52    we will now turn to the specific composition algebra of the octonions .      according to a theorem by hurwitz @xcite , which relies heavily on ( [ eq : quadratic ] )",
    "there are only four composition algebras over the reals with a positive definite bilinear form , namely the reals , @xmath53 ; the complexes , @xmath4 ; the quaternions , @xmath5 @xcite ; and the octonions or cayley numbers , @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "their dimensions as vector spaces over @xmath53 are 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 .",
    "since the norm is positive definite , there exist inverses for all elements except @xmath54 in these algebras .",
    "therefore , they are also called normed division algebras .    for specific calculations",
    "the following concrete form of @xmath6 is useful .",
    "@xmath55 as a normed vector space .",
    "fortunately , it is always possible to choose an orthonormal basis @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 which induces a particularly simple multiplication table for the basis elements such as the one given by the following triples : @xmath60 the algorithm to obtain such a basis is similar to the gram - schmidt procedure @xcite with additional requirements about products of the basis elements ( see @xcite ) .    working over the field of real numbers ,",
    "the following definitions of real and imaginary parts are customary : @xmath61 also @xmath62 is called the real unit and the other basis elements are called imaginary units , @xmath63 in analogy to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the antiautomorphism @xmath31 is called `` octonionic conjugation '' .",
    "it also changes the sign of the imaginary part . with these conventions ( [ eq : not real ] ) reads @xmath64      the question of possible multiplication tables arises , for example , when one reads another article on octonions , which , of course , uses a different one from the one given in ( [ eq : basis definition ] ) .",
    "usually it is remarked , that all 480 possible ones are equivalent , i.e. , given an octonionic algebra with a multiplication table and any other valid multiplication table one can choose a basis such that the multiplication follows the new table in this basis .",
    "one may also take the point of view , that there exist different octonionic algebras , i.e. , octonionic algebras with different multiplication tables . with this interpretation",
    "the previous statement means that all these octonionic algebras are isomorphic .",
    "however , this fact does not imply that a physical theory might not make use of more than one multiplication table at any given time . in this section",
    "we extend the ideas of coxeter @xcite , giving a detailed description of how the various multiplication tables are related to each other .",
    "a new result , which emerges from our description , is that two classes of multiplication tables can be identified , namely the class corresponding to a given algebra and the one corresponding to its opposite algebra . in a physical theory ,",
    "the distinction between these two classes becomes important when parity is not a good symmetry , i.e. , in a chiral theory .",
    "= 10.0cm=8.3 cm    the set @xmath65 in ( [ eq : basis definition ] ) can be taken to represent a labeling of the projective plane @xmath66 over the field with two elements @xmath67 ( see fig .  [ triangle ] ) .",
    "before we explain this correspondence , we introduce the basic properties of @xmath66 .",
    "( readers who are not familiar with projective geometry may consult @xcite . )",
    "this plane contains as points the one - dimensional linear subspaces of @xmath68 .",
    "given a basis of @xmath68 these subspaces are @xmath69 ( since these linear subspaces contain only one non - zero element , we will drop the angle brackets and identify the points with the non - zero elements of @xmath68 . ) the lines @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath58 , @xmath72 of the plane are the two - dimensional linear subspaces of @xmath68 , which can also be described by their normal vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath58 , @xmath75 , i.e. , the dual vectors that annihilate the subspaces : @xmath76 so there are also seven lines in @xmath66 . the geometry of the plane is then defined by the incidence of points and lines , where @xmath77 for example , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are incident with @xmath81    we are now in a position to specify the previously mentioned correspondence between @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath65 contains seven triples formed out of seven labels .",
    "the labels represent points and the triples represent lines containing the three points given by the labels , i.e. , a label and a triple are incident , if and only if the label is part of the triple .",
    "cyclic permutations of a triple change neither the multiplication table nor the geometry of the plane .",
    "however , @xmath65 does define an orientation on each line , since a transposition in a triple would change the multiplication table .",
    "this notion of orientation on the lines , is represented by arrows in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] .",
    "so we can read the multiplication table off the triangle .",
    "if we follow a line connecting two labels in direction of the arrow we obtain the product , for example , @xmath82 .",
    "when moving opposite to the direction of the arrow we pick up a minus sign , @xmath83 .",
    "( note that in projective geometry the ends of the lines are connected , i.e. , lines are topologically circles , @xmath84 .",
    "what are possible transformations of the multiplication table @xmath65 and how do they correspond to transformations of the projective plane @xmath66 ?",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , we see that there are three ways to change the picture :    * we may relabel the corners , leaving the arrows unchanged . * the labels",
    "may be kept fixed while some or all arrows are reversed .",
    "* minus signs may be attached to the labels , i.e. , we change part of ( [ eq : basis definition ] ) to read @xmath85 and cyclic for @xmath86 .",
    "the sign change of a label in type  ( iii ) is equivalent to reversing the orientation of the three lines through that point and therefore is included in the transformations of type  ( ii ) . for the second kind of transformation",
    ", we have to make sure , that the multiplication table so obtained satisfies alternativity , for it to define another octonionic algebra .",
    "one can show that given the arbitrary orientation of four lines including all seven points , the orientations of the remaining three lines are determined by alternativity .",
    "( note that there is only one case to consider . among the four lines",
    "there are necessarily three which have one point in common .",
    "two of those together with the fourth one fix one of the remaining orientations . )",
    "this in turn implies that elementary transformations of type  ( ii ) change the orientation of three lines which have one point in common .",
    "so the transformations of type  ( ii ) and type  ( iii ) are equivalent . since",
    "four arrows can be chosen freely , we obtain sixteen as the number of possible configurations of arrows , i.e. , the number of distinct multiplication tables that can be reached this way , namely : 1 original configuration with no changes , 7 with the orientation of three lines through one point reversed , 7 with the orientation of four lines avoiding one point reversed , and 1 with the orientation of all lines reversed .    in order to discuss these transformations further , we will introduce some notation .",
    "( before developing this framework , i verified most of these results using the computer algebra package maple .",
    "so the reader who is not algebraically inclined may take this proof by exhaustion as sufficient .",
    "for a basic reference on group theory see @xcite . )",
    "we denote an octonionic algebra given by an orthonormal basis of @xmath87 and a set @xmath65 of the type given in ( [ eq : basis definition ] ) by @xmath88 , and the set made up of all such octonionic algebras by @xmath89 . ``",
    "all possible @xmath65 '' means those that induce a multiplication table satisfying alternativity .",
    "so @xmath90 can be viewed as the set of possible multiplication tables .",
    "we now consider the group action of @xmath91 , the free product of transformations of type  ( i ) and ( ii ) , on @xmath90 : @xmath92 thus each @xmath93 induces an isomorphism @xmath94 .",
    "the group of transformations @xmath95 of type  ( i ) , i.e. , the relabelings of the corners , is of course the permutation group on seven letters , @xmath96 , acting in the obvious way .",
    "we identify the group @xmath97 of transformations of type  ( ii ) as @xmath98 , with the 7 generators acting as the elementary transformations reversing the orientation of the three lines through one point .",
    "earlier we saw that the orbits of an element of @xmath90 under the action of this group are of size 16 : @xmath99 . in order to determine the orbits of @xmath96 we first consider its subgroup @xmath100 which acts as the group of projective linear transformations on @xmath66 labeled as in fig .",
    "[ triangle ] , i.e. , we let @xmath100 act on one specific @xmath101 , namely with @xmath65 as in ( [ eq : basis definition ] ) .",
    "@xmath102 is generated by the permutations @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath100 is in fact simple , of lie - type , of order @xmath105 , and denoted by @xmath106 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since elements of @xmath100 as projective linear transformation do not change the geometry of @xmath66 , they can only reverse the orientations of lines , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath108 .",
    "thus the index of the stabilizing subgroup of @xmath100 has to divide 16 : @xmath109 = \\order{\\orbit{\\sgr}{\\o_\\psym}}\\ ; \\big|\\ ; 16.\\ ] ] since the action of @xmath100 is not trivial and @xmath100 being simple of order 168 can not have subgroups of index 2 or 4 , we conclude @xmath110 . to determine @xmath111 we need to consider the cosets of @xmath100 in @xmath96 .",
    "there are @xmath112 = 30 $ ] of them corresponding to distinct geometries of @xmath66 , i.e. , the incidence of lines and points is different for different cosets .",
    "therefore , there are 30 distinct classes of multiplication tables , with members of one class related by a projective linear transformation .",
    "so it follows @xmath113 so relabelings of the corners reach only half of the possible multiplication tables , which is a consequence of the fact that projective linear transformations reach only half of the possible configurations of arrows .",
    "why is this so and what are the possible implications ? to answer these questions we need to understand how elements of @xmath100 change orientations of lines .",
    "we can decompose the action of elements of @xmath100 into one part that permutes the lines and another one that reverses the orientation of certain lines in the image .",
    "an element @xmath114 of odd order @xmath115 may only change the orientation of an even number of lines . for @xmath116",
    "has to act trivially on @xmath65 , and the changes of orientation add up modulo 2 .",
    "however , @xmath100 is generated by elements of odd order , so all of its elements change only the orientation of an even number of lines . to obtain the full orbit we may add just one element @xmath117 that changes the orientation of an odd number of lines .",
    "a particularly good choice for @xmath118 is the product of all generators , i.e. , the one corresponding to reversing all seven lines ( or attaching minus signs to all labels when viewed as type  ( iii ) transformation ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath119 , so that we may form the direct product @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "note that @xmath118 corresponds to the operation of octonionic conjugation , so that the isomorphism given by @xmath118 is illustrated by the following diagram : @xmath122 ( a , b ) & \\longmapsto & ab\\\\[8pt ] \\bigr\\downarrow\\llap{$\\vcenter{\\hbox{\\kern-3em $ \\topp \\times \\topp$}}$ } & \\circlearrowleft & \\bigl\\downarrow\\rlap{$\\topp$}\\\\[8pt ] \\o_{\\topp(\\psym ) } \\times \\o_{\\topp(\\psym ) } & \\longrightarrow & \\o_{\\topp(\\psym)}\\\\[5pt ] ( \\bar{a},\\bar{b } ) = ( a^\\prime , b^\\prime ) & \\longmapsto & \\bar{(ab ) } = \\bar{b } \\ , \\bar{a } = b^\\prime \\ ,",
    "a^\\prime \\end{array}\\;.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath123 is the opposite algebra of @xmath88 , i.e. , the algebra obtained by reversing the order of all products .",
    "so for octonionic algebras , there is an isomorphism of an algebra and its opposite algebra given by octonionic conjugation , besides the natural anti - isomorphism given by identification .",
    "what are the consequences of these results for a physical theory ? usually , the physical theory will contain a vector space of dimension 8 , for which we want to introduce an octonionic description .",
    "this description , however , should be invariant under the appropriate symmetry group , most commonly , @xmath14 .",
    "the multiplication table changes in a more general way under @xmath14 .",
    "the product of two basis elements will turn out to be a linear combination of all basis elements , but the relabelings given by @xmath96 are certainly a subgroup contained in @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xmath124 , which implies that the most general multiplication tables with respect to an orthonormal basis split in two classes with @xmath14 acting transitively on each class , but only @xmath125 acting transitively on all of them .",
    "in fact we will find it useful to consider two algebra structures , namely @xmath6 and its opposite @xmath126 , on the same @xmath87 to describe the spinors of opposite chirality .    in a recent article , cederwall & preitschopf @xcite",
    "introduce an `` @xmath127-product '' on @xmath6 via @xmath128 which is just the original product for @xmath129 . as @xmath127 becomes different from 1",
    ", the multiplication table for this product changes continuously in a way related to the @xmath14 transformations that leave @xmath130 fixed .",
    "this changing product appears naturally when the basis of a spinor space is changed , see section  [ subsec : twisted spinors ] .",
    "the second building block for octonionic representations of clifford algebras is presented in this section .",
    "first we define an abstract clifford algebra and observe some of its basic properties .",
    "then we consider the clifford group which gives us the action of the orthogonal groups on vectors and spinors . in our approach to the clifford group in this second subsection we also introduce the key idea of characterizing groups by finite generators .",
    "the third subsection states the necessary facts about representations of clifford algebras , i.e. , how we can find matrix algebras to describe clifford algebras . for further reference and proofs that are left out",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we only consider the real or complex field , i.e. , @xmath131 , in this section , even though some of the statements generalize to other fields , in particular of characteristic different from @xmath8 .",
    "the tensor algebra @xmath132 of a vector space @xmath133 of dimension @xmath134 over a field @xmath20 is the free associative algebra over @xmath133 : ( all the products in this section are associative . )",

    "@xmath53 ) , namely the fact that transposition is an antiautomorphism and complex conjugation is an automorphism of matrix multiplication . we are about to replace @xmath20 by @xmath6 .",
    "since octonionic multiplication is not commutative and octonionic conjugation has become an antiautomorphism , the only remaining antiautomorphism of octonionic matrix multiplication is hermitian conjugation . due to the non - associativity of the octonions even the carrier space @xmath232",

    "furthermore , we identify @xmath133 with @xmath6 as vector spaces by @xmath404 .      an octonionic representation @xmath405 is given by @xmath406 the carrier space @xmath232 of the representation is understood to be @xmath407 , i.e. , the set of columns of two octonions , with @xmath408 acting on it by left multiplication .",
    "therefore , octonionic matrix products are interpreted as being associated to the right and acting on @xmath232 , i.e. , octonionic matrix multiplication is understood to be composition of left multiplication onto @xmath232 .",
    "for example , if we want to verify that ( [ eq:8orep ] ) is a representation , then checking that @xmath409 in accordance with ( [ eq : rep check ] ) is not sufficient .",
    "this relationship has to hold even when acting on an element @xmath410 : @xmath411 thus the alternative property ( [ eq : associative inverse ] ) of the octonions ensures the validity of the representation .    for the representation to be irreducible , we need to show that there are no non - trivial invariant subspaces .",

    "the plus sign applies .",
    "in fact , the sign difference corresponds to the two classes of multiplication tables .",
    "since @xmath422 is defined by its action under left multiplication , we have an octonionic weyl representation : @xmath426 the weyl projections take the form @xmath427 for any @xmath428 , at least one of @xmath429 or @xmath430 does not vanish . if @xmath431 , then @xmath432 ( note that @xmath433 corresponds to a vector @xmath434 and is to be distinguished from the identity @xmath435 . )",
    "if @xmath436 , then @xmath437 this completes the proof that @xmath417 is irreducible . since @xmath398 is simple , it does not contain any two - sided ideals other than @xmath242 and itself , which are also the only candidates for the kernel of any representation of @xmath398 . therefore , @xmath417 is faithful , since it is not trivial .",
    "faithfulness of the representation can also been shown constructively without using the fact that @xmath398 is simple .",
    "one has to check , for example , if the dimension of the algebra generated by @xmath438 , @xmath439 , @xmath58 , @xmath440 is @xmath441 .",
    "another approach is to construct orthogonal transformations ( see @xcite ) , since the clifford group spans the clifford algebra .",
    "so if the representation obtained for the clifford group is faithful , then so is the representation for the clifford algebra .    in this article",
    "we have chosen to rely only on the algebraic properties of the octonions , rather than using the correspondence to a real representation . however , for completeness , we give the matrices corresponding to left multiplication with respect to our convention : @xmath442    since we have an irreducible representation , we may identify the carrier space @xmath232 with the space of spinors .",
    "so for now we consider elements of @xmath407 as octonionic spinors .",
    "later in section  [ subsec : twisted spinors ] we will add a subtle twist to this understanding .",
    "since octonionic conjugation is an antiautomorphism of @xmath6 , the octonionic conjugate of the product of two matrices is not the product of the octonionic conjugates .",

    "more precisely , for products of three matrices we need to keep the grouping of the product the same , i.e. , under hermitian conjugation left multiplication by a matrix goes to right multiplication by its hermitian conjugate and vice versa .",
    "so we can define @xmath444 by @xmath445 this representation acts on the set @xmath446 of rows of two octonions by right multiplication .",

    "it is obvious that there are two more families of automorphisms of @xmath615 of order 2 , parametrized by an even spinor variable @xmath645 and an odd spinor variable @xmath646 with @xmath647 : @xmath648 and @xmath649 for these two families of maps , the matrix formalism shows the clear parallel structure to the maps @xmath643 . traditionally expressions in terms of both clifford products and the spinor bilinear form are used for the maps @xmath650 and @xmath651 , which obscures this symmetry , because in @xmath643 only clifford products are used .",
    "these two families preserve one of the spinor spaces and interchange the other one with @xmath133 : @xmath652 and @xmath653 by combining two triality maps with the same octonionic parameter @xmath654 from different families , we obtain a automorphisms @xmath655 of order  3 : @xmath656 hence @xmath657 as is seen from their matrix forms , @xmath658 and @xmath655 generate @xmath659 , the permutation group on three letters .",
    "( in particular for @xmath660 , this is easy to verify . )",
    "we observed before that the maps @xmath643 generate @xmath661 , so that the triality maps , we have found so far , have a group structure isomorphic to @xmath662 .",
    "it is known ( see @xcite ) that this is the full automorphism group of the chevalley algebra , which is also the automorphism group of @xmath14 .",
    "this concludes our demonstration of triality .",
    "in this article we characterize orthogonal groups in terms of a set of finite generators .",
    "this approach is not as widely used as the description in terms of infinitesimal generators , i.e. , the lie algebra of the group . in this section",
    "we compare the two approaches .    if we want to compare two lie groups given by infinitesimal generators we know how to proceed @xcite .",
    "we determine their lie algebra by working out the commutators of the generators .",
    "we then determine their structure constants and identify the lie algebra . for semi - simple",
    "lie algebras the cartan - weyl normalization provides a unique identification .",
    "we may also use a lie algebra homomorphism and determine its image and kernel to relate the two groups in question .",
    "whether the homomorphism is surjective and injective can often be determined by counting the dimension of the lie algebras involved .",
    "having identified the lie algebra we have full knowledge of the local structure of the lie group . from this information",
    "we can construct the simply connected universal covering group , which has this local structure .",
    "however , the lie group we are trying to characterize may be neither connected nor simply connected .",
    "so in order to compare two groups we need to have some global information about them in addition to the infinitesimal generators .",
    "in section  [ subsec : cg ] we compared two groups given by finite generators , namely the orthogonal group generated by reflections on hyperplanes and the clifford group generated by non - null vectors of the clifford algebra .",
    "the relationship was established considering a group homomorphism .",
    "the homomorphism is surjective if the generators lie in the image .",
    "this is the analogue to counting the dimension of the lie algebras . determining the kernel , which has to be a normal subgroup , completes the comparison .",
    "the advantage of finite generators is the global information that they carry .",
    "having found an isomorphism based on the finite generators , we know that the groups have the same global structure .    even though the two descriptions have different features , they are closely related .",
    "the exponential map provides a means to parametrize a neighborhood of the identity element of the group .",
    "this coordinate chart can be translated by a finite element in this neighborhood , hence we can construct an atlas of the component of the group that is connected to the identity .",
    "actually , we need information about the global structure to patch the charts together correctly . for an additional component of the group that is not connected to the identity",
    ", we may use the same atlas , since the components are diffeomorphic .",
    "the finite generators that determine the groups considered in this article are elements of a topological manifold of dimension less than the dimension of the group . for example , the octonions that generate @xmath14 ( [ eq : vector so(8 ) ] ) are elements of the octonionic unit sphere , @xmath663 . translating a disk centered at a point @xmath664 by @xmath665 , we obtain a submanifold of the group containing the identity . ( a generating set of a group",
    "is always assumed to contain inverses of every element . )",
    "this submanifold is of lower dimension than the lie group , so its tangent space at the identity is only a linear subspace of the lie algebra . in most of our examples",
    "it is sufficient to consider the translation of a sufficient number of disks contained in the generating set to obtain linear subspaces that span the lie algebra .",
    "otherwise the process continues by taking products of elements of two disks around @xmath666 and @xmath667 in the generating set and translating these products by @xmath668 to the identity .",
    "an example of this latter construction is the @xmath669 generating @xmath14 described in @xcite . in this way",
    "infinitesimal generators can be found starting from finite ones .",
    "there is also a formal construction of the entire group ; namely , the group is given by the set of equivalence classes of finite sequences of generators .",
    "the group product of two elements @xmath670 , [ g_2]$ ] is just the class of the juxtaposition @xmath671 $ ] of two representatives . for",
    "the octonionic description we need to do this decomposition into generators to find spinor and vector transformations that are consistent . for example , if a vector given by @xmath672 transforms by @xmath673 , which is an @xmath14 transformation , we need to re - express @xmath674 as @xmath675 with @xmath676 in order to determine the corresponding spinor transformation @xmath677 . in general , octonionic transformations , because of their non - associativity , involve this nesting of multiplications .",
    "therefore the octonionic description of lie groups in terms of generators is the natural one .",
    "octonionic descriptions of lie algebras , which are also possible , have the disadvantage that the exponential map no longer works because of the non - associativity .",
    "so this avenue does not provide a construction of finite group elements .",
    "we have demonstrated that the abstract octonionic algebra is a suitable structure to represent clifford algebras in certain dimensions .",
    "we obtained most of our results from the basic property of composition algebras , which is the norm compatibility of multiplication , and its consequence alternativity . the alternative property , in particular in the form of the moufang identities ,",
    "was found to be responsible for ensuring the correct transformation behavior of octonionic spinors and for ensuring the consistency of the representation in terms of left multiplication by octonionic matrices .",
    "the choice of a multiplication rule for the octonions , in particular , the modified `` @xmath127-product '' , was found to be related to coordinate transformations or a change of basis of the spinor space .",
    "the opposite octonionic algebra was shown to be connected to an analogue of the charge conjugate representation .",
    "the clifford group and its action on vectors and spinors led to octonionic representations of orthogonal groups in corresponding dimensions .",
    "the natural octonionic description of these groups is in terms of generating sets of the lie group rather than in terms of generators of the lie algebra .",
    "this is due to the nested structure which is necessary to accommodate the non - associativity of the octonions .",
    "the usefulness of this tool of octonionic representations was evident in the presentation of the triality automorphisms of the chevalley algebra .",
    "this presentation unequivocally showed that the spaces of vectors and even and odd spinors are interchangeable in this case .",
    "we expect that a similar , fully octonionic treatment of supersymmetrical theories will make their symmetries more transparent .",
    "in fact , we have successfully applied the methods of this article to the cbs - superparticle @xcite .",
    "we hope to be able to find a parallel treatment of the green - schwarz superstring .",
