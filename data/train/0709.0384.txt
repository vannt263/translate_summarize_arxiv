    "these dependencies may be combined to an interaction volume @xmath321 , i.e. , a spherical shell of thickness @xmath32 and mean radius @xmath16 , thus giving clear evidence for surface forces operating in a boundary layer at the particle surface .    in the limit @xmath322",
    ", the soret coefficient reduces to @xmath323 for large valencies one has the particularly simple form @xmath324 .",
    "now we turn to higher particle densities where the first correction of the virial expansion is no longer small .",
    "although the surface - force driven coefficient @xmath157 does not depend on density , the diffusion coefficient varies as @xmath325 .",

    "the above behavior is modified by the virial coefficient , and the soret coefficient increases with salinity , @xmath335    both dependencies on @xmath1 and @xmath336 have been , at least qualitatively , observed for sds micelles in aqueous solution  @xcite . the inverse coefficient",

    "also , part of the data are in the range @xmath340 whereas the present work relies on @xmath341 .",
    "the charged double layer is predicted to result in a normal  soret effect @xmath342 , that is , the particles drift in the direction opposite to the thermal gradient and thus accumulate in colder regions of the sample .",
    "there are , however , systems that show a more complex behavior .",
    "aqueous suspensions of maghemite particles present an inverse soret effect @xmath343 , whereas the normal behavior has been observed in organic solvents  @xcite .",

    "yet one should be aware that the actual situation at solid - fluid interfaces , especially at polar ones , is significantly more complex than suggested by the simple relation @xmath353 .",
    "moreover , because of the short range of dispersion forces , the resulting stress anisotropy occurs in a narrow layer of about one nanometer thickness .",
    "macroscopic hydrodynamics with constant viscosity may well not apply at such short distances .",
    "finally , we want to compare our analysis with previous work . in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , our description of thermophoresis relies on hydrodynamics at low reynolds numbers . in this approach ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the maxwell tensor results in a shear stress parallel to the surface , and the force acting on the particle is given by the stress accumulated through the boundary layer .",

    "a different route has been taken by several authors in the past few years  @xcite .",

    "for @xmath364 one has @xmath365 and a constant gradient @xmath366 , whereas @xmath367 flattens the temperature profile around the particle and thus significantly reduces thermal transport .",
    "the latter case is relevant for suspensions of crystalline particles , where the large heat conductivity indeed suppresses thermophoresis .",
    "the remaining factor @xmath368 occurring in the hydrodynamic treatment is related to the shape of the particle . for a prolate particle oriented along the thermal gradient ,",
    "this factor increases , whereas it is reduced for an oblate shape .",
    "this dependency could be relevant for suspended rods , such as dna with a persistence length exceeding the size of the molecule .",
    "although it misses the numerical prefactor @xmath369 , the picture of an external force provides , for weak charges , qualitatively correct results .",

    "strongly charged particles results in overestimating the soret coefficient by a factor @xmath372 .    from a more formal point of view , eq .",
    "( [ d24 ] ) suffers from two major shortcomings .",
    "first , since the entropy @xmath373 of a classical system is defined with respect to an arbitrary reference value @xmath374 only , the free energy @xmath375 comprises an arbitrary constant @xmath374 , and its the absolute value of @xmath376 does not carry physical information .",
    "this problem persists for the charging energy @xmath354 . since @xmath354 is defined with respect to the state where the excess charges are at infinity ; yet this reference state comprises the entropy of the mobile ions , which results in an arbitrary contribution to the derivative @xmath377 .",
    "a second shortcoming occurs when applying  ( [ d24 ] ) to polymer solutions and dense colloidal suspensions . since the thermally induced surface stress  ( [ 9 ] ) is treated as an external force  @xcite , the resulting flow field @xmath378",
    "comprises , contrary to eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , a term @xmath379 that would result in long - range hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite . as a consequence , for a particle suspension of volume fraction @xmath380 ,",
    "one would find a reduced value @xmath381 with @xmath382  @xcite , which is , however , an artefact of the external - force picture .",
    "an even more serious discrepancy arises for polymers , where  ( [ d26 ] ) leads to underestimate the thermophoretic current by a factor @xmath383 , with the number of monomers @xmath384 and the exponent @xmath385  @xcite .",
    "the correct treatment of the surface stress gives @xmath386 as in  ( [ 20 ] ) , i.e. , there are no long - range hydrodynamic interactions .    still , the debye - hckel approximation  ( [ c10 ] ) provides a correct description for dilute suspensions of weakly charged particles  fay05,duh06,dho07 .",
    "given the uncertainty of the surface charge density , the missing numerical prefactor @xmath387 is of little practical consequence .",
    "starting from stokes equation with a force term arising from the electric stress in diffuse double layer , we have obtained the thermodiffusion coefficient @xmath4 for charged colloidal particles .",
    "we briefly summarize our main results .",
    "\\(i ) in the limit of small valencies we confirm previous work obtained in debye - hckel approximation .",
    "novel results arise for strong charges , where the soret coefficient @xmath324 is proportional to the ratio of thermal conductivities @xmath363 and the valency @xmath166 only .",
    "\\(ii ) the coefficient @xmath388 is proportional to the particle size , for weak charges it is moreover linear in the debye length @xmath49 .  for strong charges , however , @xmath4 does not vary with @xmath49 ; in this range the soret effect does not depend on the salinity nor on the permittivity of the electrolyte .",
    "\\(iii ) comparing the charging energy @xmath354 and the integrated anisotropy parameter @xmath389 of the maxwell stress tensor , we find that these quantities coincide for weak valencies , which explains the qualitatively correct results obtained from the simple external - force picture of eq .",
