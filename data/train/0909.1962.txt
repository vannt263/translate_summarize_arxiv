    "game theory  @xcite is the study of how social or economical agents take decisions in situations of conflict .",
    "some games such as the celebrated prisoner s dilemma have a high metaphorical value for society in spite of their simplicity and abstractness .",
    "hawks - doves , also known as chicken , is one such socially significant game .",
    "hawks - doves is a two - person , symmetric game with the generic payoff bi - matrix of table  [ payoffs ] .    .payoff",
    "matrix for a symmetric two person game . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     substituting in equation  [ alpha ] gives @xmath0 , i.e. the dynamically stable polymorphic population should be composed by about @xmath1 cooperators and @xmath2 defectors .",
    "now , if one looks at fig .",
    "[ hd_coop ] at the points where @xmath3 and @xmath4 , one can see that the point , and the region around it , is one of full cooperation instead . even within the limits of the approximations caused by the finite population size and the local dynamics ,",
    "the non - homogeneous graph structure and an increased level of tie rewiring has allowed cooperation to be greatly enhanced with respect to the theoretical predictions of standard rd .      according to the model , unsatisfied agents are more likely to try to cut links in an attempt to improve their satisfaction level , which could be simply described as an average value of the strengths of their links with neighbors .",
    "satisfaction should thus tend to increase during evolution . in effect , this is what happens , as can be seen in fig .",
    "the figure refers to a particular run that ends in all agents cooperating , but it is absolutely typical .    [ !",
    "ht ]    , title=\"fig:\",width=377 ] +    one can remark the `` spike '' at time @xmath5 .",
    "this is clearly due to the fact that all links are initialized with a weight of @xmath6 . as the simulation advances",
    ", the satisfaction increases steadily and for the case of the figure , in which all agents cooperate at the end , it reaches its maximum value of @xmath7 for almost all players .",
    "evolutionary game theory provides a dynamical view of conflicting decision - making in populations .",
    "therefore , it is important to assess the _ stability _ of the equilibrium configurations .",
    "this is even more important in the case of numerical simulation where the steady - state finite population configurations are not really equilibria in the mathematical sense . in other words",
    ", one has to be reasonably confident that the steady - states are not easily destabilized by perturbations .",
    "to this end , we have performed a numerical study of the robustness of final cooperators configurations by introducing a variable amount of random noise into the system .",
    "a strategy is said to be _ evolutionarily stable _ when it can not be invaded by a small amount of players using another strategy  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen to switch the strategy of an increasing number of highly connected cooperators to defection , and to observe whether the perturbation propagates in the population , leading to total defection , or if it stays localized and disappears after a transient time .    [ !",
    "most connected nodes is switched from cooperation to defection .",

    "[ hd_noise_16 ] and  [ hd_noise_19 ] show how the system recovers when the most highly connected @xmath13% of the cooperators are suddenly and simultaneously switched to defection . in fig .",
    "[ hd_noise_16 ] the value chosen in the game s configuration space is @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this point lies approximately on the diagonal in fig .",
    "[ hd_coop ] and corresponds to an all - cooperate situation .",
    "as one can see , after the perturbation is applied , there is a sizable loss of cooperation but , after a while , the system recovers full cooperation in all cases ( only @xmath14 curves are shown in each figure for clarity , but the phenomenon is qualitatively identical in all the @xmath15 independent runs tried ) . from left to right , three values of @xmath16 are used .",
    "it is seen that , as the rewiring frequency @xmath17 increases , recovering from the perturbation becomes easier as defection has less time to spread around before cooperators are able to dismiss links toward defectors . switching",
    "the strategy of the @xmath13 % most connected nodes is rather extreme since they include most cooperator clusters but , nonetheless , cooperation is rather stable in the whole cooperating region . in fig .",
    "[ hd_noise_19 ] we have done the same this time with @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "this point is in a frontier region in which defection may often prevail , at least for low @xmath17 ( see fig .",
    "[ hd_coop ] ) and thus it represents one of the hardest cases for cooperation to remain stable . nevertheless , except in the leftmost case ( @xmath19 ) where half of the runs permanently switch to all - defect , in all the other cases the population is seen to recover after cooperation has fallen down to less than @xmath20 .",
    "note that the opposite case is also possible in this region that is , in a full defect situation , switching of @xmath21 highly connected defectors to cooperation can lead the system to one of full cooperation . in conclusion ,",
    "the above numerical experiments have empirically shown that cooperation is extremely stable after cooperator networks have emerged .",
    "although we are using here an artificial society of agents , this can hopefully be seen as an encouraging result for cooperation in real societies .      in this section",
    "we present a statistical analysis of the global and local properties of the networks that emerge when the pseudo - equilibrium states of the dynamics are attained .",
    "note that in the following sections the graph we refer to is the unoriented , unweighted one that we called @xmath22 in sect .",
    "in other words , for the structural properties of interest , we only take into account the fact that two agents interact and not the weights of their directed interactions .",
    "small - world networks are characterized by a small mean path length and by a high clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "our graphs start random , and thus have short path lengths by construction since their mean path length @xmath23 scales logarithmically with the number of vertices @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that they maintain short diameters at equilibrium too , after rewiring has taken place .",
    "we took the average @xmath25 of the mean path length of @xmath26 evolved graphs , which represent ten graphs for each @xmath27 pair .",
    "this average is 3.18 , which is of the order of @xmath28 , while its initial random graph average value is @xmath29 .",
    "this fact , together with the remarkable increase of the clustering coefficients with respect to the random graph ( see below ) , shows that the evolved networks have the small - world property .",
    "of course , this behavior was expected , since the rewiring mechanism favors close partners in the network and thus tends to increase the clustering and to shorten the distances .",
    "in contrast to other models  @xcite , the mean degree @xmath30 can vary during the course of the simulation .",
    "we found that @xmath30 increases only slightly and tends to stabilize around @xmath31 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with observations made on real dynamical social networks  @xcite with the only difference that the network does not grow in our model .    [ !",
    "ht ]     runs for three values of @xmath17 .",
    "[ hd_clust],title=\"fig:\",width=548 ] +      the clustering coefficient @xmath32 of a graph has been defined in the introduction section .",
    "random graphs are locally homogeneous in the average and for them @xmath32 is simply equal to the probability of having an edge between any pair of nodes independently . in contrast ,",
    "real networks have local structures and thus higher values of @xmath32 . fig .",
    "[ hd_clust ] gives the average clustering coefficient @xmath33 for each sampled point in the hawks - doves configuration space , where @xmath15 is the number of network realizations used for each simulation .",
    "the networks self - organize through dismissal of partners and choice of new ones and they acquire local structure , since the clustering coefficients are higher than that of a random graph with the same number of edges and nodes , which is @xmath34 .",
    "the clustering tends to increase with @xmath17 ( i.e.  from left to right in fig .",
    "[ hd_clust ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the increase in clustering and the formation of cliques is due to the fact that , when dismissing an unprofitable relation and searching for a new one , individuals that are relationally at a short distance are statistically favored . but",
    "this has a close correspondence in the way in which new acquaintances are made in society : they are not random , rather people often get to interact with each other through common acquaintances , or `` friends of friends '' and so on .      the _ degree distribution function _ ( ddf )",
    "@xmath35 of a graph represents the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath36 .",
    "random graphs are characterized by ddf of poissonian form @xmath37 , while social and technological real networks often show long tails to the right , i.e. there are nodes that have an unusually large number of neighbors  @xcite . in some extreme cases",
    "the ddf has a power - law form @xmath38 ; the tail is particularly extended and there is no characteristic degree . the _ cumulative degree distribution function _ ( cddf ) is just the probability that the degree is greater than or equal to @xmath36 and has the advantage of being less noisy for high degrees .",
    "[ hd_df ] shows the cddfs for the hawks - doves for three values of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 with a logarithmic scale on the y - axis .",
    "a poisson and an exponential distribution are also included for comparison .",
    "the poisson curve actually represents the initial degree distribution of the ( random ) population graph .",
    "the distributions at equilibrium are far from the poissonian that would apply if the networks would remain essentially random .",
    "however , they are also far from the power - law type , which would appear as a straight line in the log - log plot of fig  [ cddf - ll ] .    [ !",
    "ht ]    . a poissonian and an exponential distribution",
    "are also plotted for comparison .",

    "log - log scales.[cddf - ll],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    although a reasonable fit with a single law appears to be difficult , these empirical distributions are closer to exponentials , in particular the curve for @xmath42 , for which such a fit has been drawn . it can be observed that the distribution is broader the higher @xmath39 ( the higher @xmath39 , the more agents gain by defecting ) .",
    "in fact , although cooperation is attained nearly everywhere in the game s configuration space , higher values of the temptation @xmath39 mean that agents have to rewire their links more extensively , which results in a higher number of neighbors for some players , and thus it leads to a longer tail in the cddf .    [ !",
    "lin - log scales.[hd - cddf - q],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    the influence of the @xmath17 parameter on the shape of the degree distribution functions is shown in fig .",
    "[ hd - cddf - q ] where average curves for three values of @xmath17 , @xmath42 , and @xmath40 , are reported . for high @xmath17 , the cooperating steady - state is reached faster , which gives the network less time to rearrange its links . for lower values of @xmath17 the distributions",
    "become broader , despite the fact that rewiring occurs less often , because cooperation in this region is harder to attain and more simulation time is needed . in conclusion , emerging network structures at steady states have ddfs that are similar to those found in actual social networks  @xcite , with tails that are fatter the higher the temptation @xmath39 and the lower @xmath17 .",
    "topologies closer to scale - free would probably be obtained if the model allowed for growth , since preferential attachment is already present to some extent due to the nature of the rewiring process  @xcite .",
    "besides the degree distribution function of a network , it is also sometimes useful to investigate the empirical joint degree - degree distribution of neighboring vertices .",
    "however , it is difficult to obtain reliable statistics because the data set is usually too small ( if a network has @xmath43 edges , with @xmath44 where @xmath24 is the number of vertices for the usually relatively sparse networks we deal with , one then has only @xmath43 pairs of data to work with ) .",
    "approximate statistics can readily be obtained by using the average degree of the nearest neighbors of a vertex @xmath45 as a function of the degree of this vertex , @xmath46  @xcite .    [ !",
    "ht ]    , title=\"fig:\",width=283 ] +    from fig .  [ ddc ]",
    "one can see that the correlation is slightly negative , or disassortative .",
    "this is at odds with what is reported about real social networks , in which usually this correlation is positive instead , i.e. high - degree nodes tend to connect to high - degree nodes and vice - versa  @xcite .",
    "however , real social networks establish and grow because of common interests , collaboration work , friendship and so on . here",
    "this is not the case , since the network is not a growing one , and the game played by the agents is antagonistic and causes segregation of highly connected cooperators into clusters in which they are surrounded by less highly connected fellows .",
    "this will be seen more pictorially in the following section .      from the results of the previous sections",
    ", it appears that a much higher amount of cooperation than what is predicted by the standard theory for mixing populations can be reached when ties can be broken and rewired .",
    "we have seen that this dynamics causes the graph to acquire local structure , and thus to loose its initial randomness .",
    "in other words , the network self - organizes in order to allow players to cooperate as much as possible . at the microscopic , i.e.  agent level",
    ", this happens through the formation of clusters of players using the same strategy .",
    "[ hd_cluster ] shows one typical cooperator cluster .    [ !",
    "ht ]    , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    in the figure one can clearly see that the central cooperator is a highly connected node and there are many links also between the other neighbors .",
    "such tightly packed structures have emerged to protect cooperators from defectors that , at earlier times , were trying to link to cooperators to exploit them .",
    "these observations help understand why the degree distributions are long - tailed ( see previous section ) , and also the higher values of the clustering coefficient .",
    "+ further studies of the emerging networks would imply investigating the communities and the way in which strategies are distributed in them .",
    "there are many ways to reveal the modular structure of networks  @xcite but we leave this study for further work .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new dynamical population structure for agents playing a series of two - person hawks and doves game .",
    "the most novel feature of the model is the adoption of a variable strength of the bi - directional social ties between pairs of players .",
    "these strengths change dynamically and independently as a function of the relative satisfaction of the two end points when playing with their immediate neighbors in the network .",
    "a player may wish to break a tie to a neighbor and the probability of cutting the link is higher the weaker the directed link strength is .",
    "the ensemble of weighted links implicitly represents a kind of memory of past encounters although , technically speaking , the game is not iterated . while in previous work the rewiring parameters where ad hoc , unspecified probabilities , we have made an effort to relate them to the agent s propensity to gauge the perceived quality of a relationship during time .",
    "+ the model takes into account recent knowledge coming from the analysis of the structure and of the evolution of social networks and , as such , should be a better approximation of real social conflicting situations than static graphs such as regular grids .",
    "in particular , new links are not created at random but rather taking into account the `` trust '' a player may have on her relationally close social environment as reflected by the current strengths of its links .",
    "this , of course , is at the origin of the de - randomization and self - organization of the network , with the formation of stable clusters of cooperators .",
    "the main result concerning the nature of the pseudo - equilibrium states of the dynamics is that cooperation is greatly enhanced in such a dynamical artificial society and , furthermore , it is quite robust with respect to large strategy perturbations .",
    "although our model is but a simplified and incomplete representation of social reality , this is encouraging , as the hawks - doves game is a paradigm for a number of social and political situations in which aggressivity plays an important role .",
    "the standard result is that bold behavior does not disappear at evolutionary equilibrium .",
    "however , we have seen here that a certain amount of plasticity of the networked society allows for full cooperation to be consistently attained .",
    "although the model is an extremely abstract one , it shows that there is place for peaceful resolution of conflict . in future work",
    "we would like to investigate other stochastic strategy evolution models based on more refined forms of learning than simple imitation and study the global modular structure of the equilibrium networks . +",
