    "the discovery in recent years of many isolated neutron stars ( nss ) at the centers of supernova remnants ( snrs ) confirms the long - held notion that these ultra - dense stellar remnants are born in supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "most nss are identified as pulsars , whose emission derives either from rotational energy loss , as for the rapidly spinning pulsars in the crab ( @xmath8  ms ) and vela ( @xmath9  ms ) remnants , or from magnetic field decay , as posited for the highly magnetized @xmath10  g ) anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) . however , the nature of a significant fraction of the young ( @xmath11  yrs ) nss in snrs is uncertain",
    "these so - called central compact objects ( ccos ) are seemingly isolated nss , distinguished by their steady flux , predominantly thermal x - ray emission , lack of optical or radio counterparts , and absence of a pulsar wind nebula ( see review by pavlov et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the properties of eight confirmed and proposed ccos are summarized in table  1 .",
    "( we omit the unique source 1e 161348@xmath125055 at the center of rcw 103 because its large - amplitude variability @xcite violates the adopted definition . )",
    "cco luminosities are typically @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 , similar to the younger pulsars ; however , their spectra are best characterized as hot blackbody emission of @xmath15  kev , or two such components .",
    "this is significantly hotter than the surfaces of radio pulsars or other radio - quiet nss and corresponds to only a small fraction of the ns surface area , with @xmath16  km .",
    "here we summarize new results on two unique pulsars that were initially identified as ccos .",
    "their properties , listed in table 2 , are strikingly different from both the traditional radio pulsars and the magnetars .",
    "the lack of a measurable period derivative requires that they have :    * small natal magnetic fields ( @xmath17  g ) , * slow initial spin periods very near to their present values ( @xmath18  s ) , and * x - ray luminosities powered by internal cooling , and possibly by accretion of supernova ( sn ) debris .",
    "we predict that these properties will come to characterize the cco class of young neutron stars in general .",
    "this can be tested with more sensitive searches for pulsations from those objects listed in table  1 .",

    ", the @xmath41 upper limit on @xmath42 implies a spin - down luminosity @xmath43  erg  s@xmath14 , surface magnetic field strength @xmath44  g , and characteristic age @xmath45  myr .",
    "this lower limit on @xmath46 exceeds the snr age by at least @xmath47 orders of magnitude , requiring that the pulsar was born spinning at its present period to three significant digits .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of , @xmath48 erg  s@xmath14 , exceeds its @xmath49 , implying that @xmath50 derives from residual cooling , and perhaps partly from accreting sn debris .",
    "we also discovered pulsations from a second cco , in the snr kes  79 @xcite ( fig .",
    "our follow - up program to time  produced a remarkable result : no change in its 105  ms period over 2.4 yr @xcite . from the data shown in figure  4",
    ", we derived a @xmath41 upper limit of @xmath51 , which leads to a spin - down luminosity @xmath52  erg  s@xmath14 , surface magnetic field strength @xmath53  g , and characteristic age @xmath54  myr .",
    "again , this implies that the pulsar was born spinning at its current period , with a weaker @xmath55-field than that of any other young pulsar .",
    "these are the only two nss whose initial rotation periods are so precisely inferred .",
    "they are longer than what was once thought typical , but in fact are consistent with recent statistical analyses of the radio pulsar population , e.g. , faucher - gigure & kaspi @xcite who favor a wide distribution of birth periods ( gaussian mean @xmath56  ms and @xmath57  ms ) .",
    "the absence of spin - down for both cco pulsars then highlights the difficulty of existing theories to explain the high luminosities and temperatures of cco thermal x - ray spectra .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are a large fraction of their @xmath49 , challenging the rotation - powered assumption , and greater than their reservoirs of @xmath55-field energy , refuting the magnetar hypothesis .",

    "instead , the high blackbody temperatures ( @xmath75  kev ) and small blackbody radii ( @xmath16  km ) of ccos may be evidence of accretion onto a polar cap , possibly from a fallback disk of sn debris .",
    "interior cooling models , even with anisotropic conduction , do not make such a concentrated hot spot .",
    "we @xcite proposed this as the origin of ccos : magnetic field is generated by a turbulent dynamo whose strength depends on the rotation rate of the proto - neutron star @xcite , so the magnetic field strength would be inversely correlated with the initial period . if @xmath20 is large and @xmath67 is small , accretion of sn debris is possible .",
    "accretion excludes neutron stars born with both @xmath5  g and @xmath6  s from radio pulsar surveys , where @xmath5  g is not found except in very old ( @xmath76  myr ) or recycled pulsars .",
    "another clue to the nature of ccos is the soft x - ray spectrum of .",
    "it has broad absorption lines centered at @xmath77  kev and @xmath78  kev @xcite . our upper limit , @xmath79  g , favors the electron cyclotron model @xcite , for at least one of the lines , over all others that require stronger fields .",
    "the basic cyclotron prediction , @xmath80  g , assumes that 0.7  kev is the fundamental energy @xmath81 kev , where @xmath82 is the gravitational redshift .",
    "another solution postulates hydrogenic oxygen for the 0.7  kev line , while the 1.4  kev line is the cyclotron fundamental @xcite .",
    "as the authors of the latter hypothesis pointed out , abundant oxygen may be accreted from sn debris .",
    "accretion from a fallback disk of sn debris in the propeller regime has been considered for ccos by several authors @xcite .",
    "we propose that this may be the first phase in the life of those neutron stars born rotating slowly with weak magnetic fields .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of ccos , or possibly just their hot spots , can be powered by accretion of @xmath83 g  s@xmath14 , or only @xmath84 lunar masses of supernova debris over their @xmath74  kyr lifetimes . the main barrier to disk accretion",
    "is the speed - of - light cylinder , of radius @xmath85 .",
    "if an accretion disk can not penetrate the light cylinder , the ns can not interact with the disk , and it behaves as a isolated pulsar .",
    "but if @xmath67 is as small as @xmath86  g , accretion at a rate @xmath87  g  s@xmath14 can penetrate the light cylinder to the magnetospheric radius @xmath88 , since @xmath89 in this case .",
    "if so , the system is in the propeller regime , in which matter flung out from @xmath88 at a rate @xmath90 takes angular momentum from the ns , causing it to spin down . in the case of , we @xcite estimated the propeller spin - down rate as @xmath91 @xmath92 using the prescription of menou et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "@xmath93 g  @xmath94 is the ns moment of inertia , @xmath95 g  @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the equilibrium , or minimum period for disk accretion .",
    "appropriate scaling for the 0.424  s period of  can be substituted in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "these predictions for accretion are close to the observed upper limits on @xmath42 ( table  2 ) .",
    "we distinguish here between @xmath90 , the matter expelled that is responsible for the torque on the ns , and @xmath83  g  s@xmath14 , the matter accreted , which is responsible for the x - ray emission from the surface , presumably at a magnetic pole of the ns . for the propeller model to be self - consistent , @xmath90 must be @xmath98 , which is possible according to equation ( 1 ) as long as @xmath99  g. in x - ray binaries , the propeller effect does not necessarily preclude accretion onto the ns surface .",
    "the disposition of material leaving the inner edge of the accretion disk is not well understood , and many authors , e.g. , rappaport et al .",
    "@xcite , consider that accretion onto the ns can proceed even in the propeller ( fast pulsar ) regime .",
    "we adopt that point of view here . accreting x - ray binary pulsars",
    "are often found in near equilibrium states where @xmath42 changes sign without changing luminosity . equation ( 1 )",
    "may then represent the typical magnitude of @xmath42 , independent of sign , albeit at an accretion rate 45 orders of magnitude less than in binaries .",
    "whether cco pulsars are accreting or not , the conclusion that they have weak magnetic fields is unavoidable .",
    "the hypothesis of dipole spin - down can be quantified by measuring @xmath42 using phase - coherent timing , the only method that is effective in a reasonable time span for detecting such small @xmath55-fields .",
    "a steady , positive @xmath42 will yield @xmath67 via the dipole spin - down formula , @xmath100 .",
    "but if the pulsars show episodes of fluctuating or negative @xmath42 , that will be evidence of accretion , i.e. , torque noise .",
    "existing data can not ( yet ) be used to accomplish these tests because they were not densely spaced enough to span gaps of several months with a coherent timing solution free of cycle count uncertainties . but a carefully planned sequence of new observations can be used to fit a coherent ephemeris that will bootstrap the historical data into a phase - linked timing solution spanning 4.5 years for , and 10 years for , which will improve the sensitivity to @xmath42 by 3 orders of magnitude over the limits in table  2 , reaching limits of @xmath101  g.",
    "ccos represent a significant fraction of young nss . here",
    ", we propose that their birth properties are common enough to be a likely explanation for the inconspicuous nature of the two youngest nss , the cco in cas  a , and an undetected pulsar in the sn 1987a remnant .",
    "the cas  a cco is the youngest known ns ( 327 yr ) ; the sn was probably seen by flamsteed in 1680 , which agrees with the measured convergent date of the snr ejecta @xcite . the simple argument that ccos are born spinning at their current periods , and with their current magnetic field strengths , implies that their luminosities need not decrease substantially since birth .",
    "only their interior cooling would reduce their soft x - ray emission .",
    "the cas  a cco is characterized , like the others , by its steady x - ray luminosity of @xmath102 erg  s@xmath14 , compared to @xmath103 erg  s@xmath14 for magnetars .",
    "nevertheless , despite the strong evidence that cco pulsars have weak magnetic fields , there is circumstantial evidence that cas a may host a magnetar . rapidly moving ir features detected by the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _",
    "outside cas  a were interpreted as a light echo from a beamed , high - energy flare some 55 years ago that is heating the surrounding interstellar dust @xcite .",
    "an sgr - like outburst of @xmath104  erg ( isotropic equivalent ) would have been required to explain the reprocessed ir luminosity . until recently , a quiescent magnetar was a favored hypothesis for the nature of the cas  a point source .",
    "however , the magnetar hypothesis implies that the present rotation period of the 327  old pulsar is @xmath105  s , assuming that its initial period @xmath106 , which also requires that @xmath107 erg  s@xmath14 .",
    "cas  a could therefore have a spin - down luminosity that exceeds the typical @xmath108 erg  s@xmath14 x - ray luminosity of all other magnetars .",
    "such a large spin - down luminosity is almost always accompanied by substantial non - thermal x - ray luminosity , of order @xmath109 , including a resolvable pulsar wind nebula . the absence of any x - ray evidence of such energetic spin - down argues against the presence of a typical magnetar @xmath55-field in the cas  a point source .",
    "thus , cas  a is the focus of sharply contradictory evidence about the birth properties of ccos : their natal magnetic field strengths and initial spin periods . apart from waiting for an sgr or axp - like outburst ( which may never occur ) , the only way to resolve whether cas  a hosts a transient magnetar or an `` anti - magnetar '' is by direct measurement of its spin properties .",
    "a pulsar in cas  a will reveal the spin period and dipole @xmath55-field of a ns at an age that is only a few percent of the known axps and ccos ages , providing a correspondingly more secure representation of their initial values .",
    "if the magnetar hypothesis is not confirmed , it may imply that the high - energy flare was powered by a one - time event in cas a , a first - order phase transition ( corequake ) @xcite , e.g. , to a pion or kaon condensate or deconfined quarks .",
    "that would be a remarkable outcome .",
    "it has long been known that the non - detection of a pulsar in sn 1987a can be explained if the ns was born with a weak @xmath55-field or a long rotation period @xcite .",
    "now , we have established that a cco can have both , which gives it essentially the same spin - down luminosity at birth that it has at an age of @xmath110  yr .",
    "this means that a cco can emit less than the observed limits from sn  1987a even if 100% of its spin - down power is reprocessed into ir emission by dust in the surrounding sn ejecta .",
    "the observed luminosity limits for a point source inside the ring of sn  1987a are  in x - rays : @xmath111 erg  s@xmath14 corrected for extinction @xcite , in the visible range : @xmath112   ) @xmath113 erg  s@xmath14 corrected for dust absorption @xcite , and at mid - ir wavelengths : @xmath114 erg  s@xmath14 for dust emitting at @xmath115  k @xcite .",
    "this mid - ir luminosity can be accounted for by radioactive decay of @xmath116ti , and therefore represents a very conservative upper limit on the spin - down power of an embedded pulsar . at an age of @xmath117  yr",
    ", a cooling ns need emit only @xmath118 erg  s@xmath14 of soft x - rays at a temperature of @xmath119  k @xcite , some of which is absorbed by sn ejecta or ism in the lmc .",
    "so we conclude that a cco is a promising model for an unseen ns in sn  1987a .",
    "given the lack of any other ns signatures from ccos , a continuing search for surface thermal x - ray emission as the ejecta thin out is perhaps the best hope of detecting the ns in sn  1987a , even though it is becoming more difficult as the snr brightens dramatically .",
