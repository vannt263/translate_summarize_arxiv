    "graph partitioning is used in many applications , including community detection  @xcite , image segmentation  @xcite , and data mining  @xcite , where it is necessary to partition a graph into modules or clusters of similar , or similarly behaving , nodes .",
    "spectral partitioning uses the eigenvectors associated with the @xmath0 smallest eigenvalues of the graph laplacian matrix ( or its normalized version ) to partition the graph into @xmath0 clusters  @xcite .",
    "existing methods for spectral partitioning are closely associated with random walks on graphs .",
    "a random walk is a stochastic dynamic process where transitions take place from a node to a random neighbor of that node , and it is described by the ( normalized ) graph laplacian .",
    "the existence of a good partition implies that random walks take a long time to reach a stationary distribution on the graph  @xcite , because they spend a long time within a module and seldom pass between modules  @xcite .",
    "this forms a basis for objective functions used to select which edges to cut so as to partition the graph , such as normalized cut and conductance , though these functions have trouble partitioning real - world graphs where many inter - module edges obscure the underlying structure  @xcite .",
    "epidemic diffusion is another type of dynamic process on a graph .",
    "an epidemic undergoes transitions simultaneously to all the neighbors of a given node , rather than a single neighbor , and is often used to model the spread of a virus or an innovation through a social network  @xcite .",
    "recently , lerman and ghosh introduced the replicator matrix  @xcite , an analog of the graph laplacian , to describe epidemic diffusion on graphs .",
    "they used the replicator to simulate dynamics of synchronization in a network of oscillators , showing that oscillators coupled via epidemic diffusion synchronize into different structures than oscillators coupled via random walk - like diffusion .",
    "we propose a method for spectral graph partitioning based on epidemic diffusion .",
    "first , we show that the replicator is equivalent to the symmetric normalized laplacian of a reweighted graph , where new edge weights are the product of old edge weights and the eigenvector centralities of the two end points .",
    "the eigenvector centrality  @xcite of a graph is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix .",
    "therefore , edges linking central nodes are given a higher weight by the reweighting scheme .",
    "the equivalence between the replicator and symmetric normalized laplacian of a reweighted graph allows us to exploit well - known relationships between spectral clustering and graph partitioning . to use the replicator for spectral partitioning",
    ", we give a computationally efficient procedure that orders nodes based on the componentwise ratio of the second to first eigenvectors and selects a partition that minimizes a quality function computed on the reweighted graph .",
    "this tends to preserve dense structures , since edges linking more central nodes in such dense clusters are less likely to be cut .",
    "we study the performance of the proposed spectral partitioning method using synthetic graphs with known community structure .",
    "we demonstrate that spectral clustering based on epidemics leads to a better recovery of ground truth communities than traditional methods based on the graph laplacian , especially in graphs that are more challenging because of the presence of many edges between clusters .",
    "our work suggests that epidemic diffusion can be a useful probe of graph structure , as it can illuminate properties of graphs that are distinct from those found by methods based on the random walk .",
    "an unweighted graph @xmath1 , with vertices ( or nodes ) @xmath2 and edges ( or links ) @xmath3 , can be represented by a @xmath4 adjacency matrix @xmath5 , with @xmath6 if the edge @xmath7 , and @xmath8 otherwise . by convention @xmath9 .",
    "we consider undirected graphs , where @xmath10 .",
    "the degree of node @xmath11 is defined as the number of edges incident on it , @xmath12 .",
    "other useful constructs are @xmath13 , a diagonal degree matrix where @xmath14 , and the identity matrix @xmath15 .      the graph laplacian matrix is defined as @xmath16 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath17 capture many properties of the graph . in the simplest case ,",
    "if the graph has @xmath0 disjoint components , the @xmath0 smallest eigenvalues of @xmath17 are zero , and the associated eigenvectors are indicator functions assigning nodes to their respective cluster or community  @xcite .",
    "even if the @xmath0 smallest eigenvalues are not all zero , their corresponding eigenvectors can be used to partition nodes into @xmath0 clusters by projecting these nodes onto a subspace of the first @xmath0 eigenvectors and using standard clustering techniques such as @xmath0-means  @xcite .",
    "the simplest spectral clustering method , spectral bisection , partitions nodes based on the values of the second eigenvector @xmath18 of the adjacency matrix or the graph laplacian . a splitting value @xmath19 is used to divide the nodes into different clusters based on whether @xmath20 or @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "a range of splitting values have been used , including zero , the median value within the vector , the largest gap , and the value producing the best ratio cut , best conductance  @xcite , or another measure .    in practice ,",
    "normalized versions of the graph laplacian produce better results in spectral clustering applications  @xcite .",
    "two examples are the symmetric normalized laplacian @xmath22 and the random walk laplacian @xmath23 , so named because the matrix of transition probabilities for a random walk on a graph is given by @xmath24 .      intuitively , a cluster is a set of nodes @xmath25 that are more tightly connected to each other than to nodes outside of the cluster .",
    "we use @xmath26 to denote the complement of @xmath27 , which consists of nodes that are not in @xmath27 . in order to bisect the graph into two disjoint clusters , one typically wants to minimize the number of cut edges between clusters , @xmath28 while maximizing cluster size , which may be measured by the number of nodes it contains , @xmath29 , or the sum of the degrees of the nodes in the set , @xmath30 ,",
    "also called volume of the set .",
    "several functions have been proposed for measuring the quality of a graph cut .",
    "the best known of these are ratio cut @xmath31 and normalized cut @xmath32 : @xmath33    there is a relationship between graph cuts and spectral clustering .",
    "deciding which edges to cut to optimize any of these quality functions is an np - complete problem .",
    "spectral clustering solves a relaxation of the problem , where the discrete indicator variables that assign nodes to clusters become continuous .",
    "although in general there are no useful bounds for the approximation produced by this relaxation  @xcite , in practice it often provides a simple and effective clustering method .",
    "solutions to the relaxed optimization problem are given by the second eigenvector of the graph laplacian @xmath17 or the normalized graph laplacian @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "relaxing ratio cut leads to spectral clustering using @xmath17 , while relaxing normalized cut leads to spectral clustering using @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "such relaxation methods have also been applied productively to the popular modularity maximization method for community detection  @xcite . by analogy with spectral bisection  @xcite",
    ", the leading eigenvector approach assigns nodes to clusters based on the sign of the components of the leading eigenvector of the modularity matrix .",
    "there exists a further relationship between spectral clustering , the partition quality function , and properties of random walks .",
    "a random walk on a graph is a stochastic process where transitions take place to a randomly chosen neighbor of a given node .",
    "cluster properties of the graph can be expressed in terms of the transition matrix @xmath24  @xcite of a random walk .",
    "spectral clustering finds a partition such that a random walk stays within the same cluster for a long time and seldom jumps between clusters  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the presence of a good partition ( low normalized cut value ) implies that it will take a random walk a long time to reach its equilibrium distribution .",
    "an epidemic is a dynamic process that simultaneously undergoes transitions to every neighbor of the current node .",
    "epidemics are used to model the spread of disease  @xcite and innovation  @xcite in social networks .",
    "epidemics differ from random walks in important ways .",
    "first , rather than choosing a single neighbor to transition to or `` infect '' as the random walk does , an epidemic will attempt to `` infect '' every neighbor of a node . in a random walk ,",
    "the probability of finding the walker in a given location is a conserved quantity that diffuses through the graph , and the random walk transition matrix is a stochastic matric .",
    "epidemics , on the other hand , replicate themselves with each successful transmission , without following a conservation law  @xcite .    lerman and ghosh",
    "@xcite introduced the replicator operator @xmath35 to describe dynamics of synchronization in a network of nodes coupled via epidemic diffusion . here",
    "@xmath36 is the largest eigenvalue of @xmath5 , also known as the epidemic threshold  @xcite . in this system ,",
    "a dynamic variable @xmath37 associated with node @xmath11 can change its value based on the values of its neighbors according to : @xmath38 where @xmath39 replaces the laplacian used in the analogous heat equation that gives the ( diffusive ) evolution of a random walk on a graph  @xcite . by construction",
    ", the replicator has a steady state given by @xmath40 , the eigenvector of @xmath5 associated with @xmath36 : @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath40 is also known as the _ eigenvector centrality _",
    "@xcite , and was introduced by bonacich to explain the importance of actors in a social network based on the importance of the actors to which they were connected .",
    "clusters of nodes with similar values of the dynamic variable @xmath42 emerge as the system of coupled nodes evolves towards the steady state  @xcite .",
    "this motivates a community detection method with nodes classified according to the rate of convergence to their steady - state values . for large time @xmath43",
    ", we approximate the solution to eq .",
    "[ eq : evolution ] using the two leading eigenvectors @xmath40 and @xmath44 of @xmath39 , @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are constants , and @xmath48 is the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath39 associated with eigenvector @xmath44 , guaranteed to be nonzero if the graph is connected .",
    "therefore , convergence depends on @xmath49 , the componentwise ratio of the second to first eigenvectors .",
    "note that eigenvectors of @xmath39 corresponding to @xmath39 s two smallest eigenvalues are the same as the eigenvectors of @xmath5 corresponding to @xmath5 s two largest eigenvalues .      in a social network , one might expect nodes of high `` importance '' to attract other nodes , resulting in communities forming around nodes with large eigenvector centrality values @xmath50 . in this section",
    "we propose a modification of our graph , converting the unweighted network into a weighted one where weights are given by the product of the eigenvector centralities of an edge s end points : @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , we show that the replicator on the unweighted graph given by @xmath5 is in fact exactly equivalent to the symmetric normalized laplacian of the reweighted graph given by @xmath52 .    in the reweighted graph ,",
    "the degree of node @xmath11 is given by @xmath53 for convenience , define @xmath54 as the diagonal matrix whose elements are the components of eigenvector @xmath40 , i.e.,@xmath55 .",
    "then , from @xmath56 and @xmath57 above , @xmath58 we can now write the symmetric normalized laplacian of the reweighted graph : @xmath59 hence , @xmath60 .",
    "the equivalence between epidemics and the diffusive process of random walks is at first surprising .",
    "diffusive processes conserve the total amount of the substance diffusing , whereas no such conservation law holds for epidemics  @xcite .",
    "the intuition for the equivalence of the two processes is the following .",
    "a node s eigenvector centrality gives the number of paths connecting it to all other nodes in the graph  @xcite ; hence , the product of eigenvector centralities of a pair of nodes captures how much of the substance is newly created when the epidemic follows the edge linking the pair . by encoding the amount of non - conservation in edge reweighting ,",
    "this scheme allows the epidemic to be reduced to diffusion .",
    "the equivalence proved above allows us to exploit the properties of the symmetric normalized laplacian , along with its relationship to graph partitioning , for epidemic diffusion . since the replicator is simply @xmath34 of the reweighted graph @xmath52 , spectral clustering using the replicator corresponds to a relaxation of normalized cut on this reweighted graph .",
    "the appropriate measure for assessing graph cut quality with the replicator is therefore normalized cut on the reweighted graph @xmath61 .",
    "we use a simple example to highlight the differences between traditional graph partitioning and one based on epidemics . consider the graph in figure  [ fig : toy ] , which shows a dense cluster connected through node 6 to a sparsely linked cluster .",
    "such a configuration is common in social networks , where a high - degree hub linking different communities may obscure community boundaries .",
    "we expect a good partition to group node @xmath62 with other nodes in its clique . however , the cut ( @xmath63 ) that minimizes normalized cut ( @xmath32 ) groups node @xmath62 with nodes @xmath64@xmath65 and assigns nodes @xmath66@xmath67 to the other cluster .",
    "multiple cuts minimize ratio cut ( @xmath31 ) , including one that groups together nodes @xmath68@xmath65 .",
    "node @xmath62 has the highest eigenvector centrality .",
    "furthermore , nodes that belong to the clique have higher centrality values than other nodes .",
    "consequently , in the _ reweighted _ graph , the edges linking node @xmath62 to the rest of the clique are more `` expensive '' to cut , and nodes @xmath62@xmath67 are grouped together by the preferred cut ( @xmath69 ) that minimizes both the ratio cut @xmath70 and the normalized cut @xmath61 on the reweighted graph .",
    "the quality measures of the cuts are shown in the table in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy ] . by giving edges linking central nodes a higher weight ,",
    "epidemic - based graph partitioning thus preserves dense , clique - like structures .",
    "accordingly , deleting these edges will have the greatest impact on reducing the spread of an epidemic  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      we now describe an efficient method for spectral clustering using epidemic diffusion based on spectral bisection  @xcite .",
    "first , we create a vector @xmath18 that is the componentwise ratio of the second eigenvector @xmath44 to the first eigenvector @xmath40 of the operator @xmath39 and sort its values .",
    "next , we examine all @xmath71 cuts in this ordering ( where @xmath72 ) and pick one corresponding to the partition that minimizes an appropriate quality measure .",
    "the quality measure we use with @xmath39 is normalized cut on the reweighted graph ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we compare the resulting partition with those produced by applying an analogous splitting procedure to @xmath17 , with quality measure @xmath31 , and @xmath34 , with quality measure @xmath32 ( on the original graph ) .",
    "the proposed optimization procedure is exhaustive , since it tests all @xmath71 possible cuts within the ordering produced by @xmath18 .",
    "it may seem that there would be some loss in accuracy from restricting our search to cuts in a one - dimensional projection , rather than searching over the entire subspace spanned by the first two eigenvectors @xmath40 and @xmath44 .",
    "however , it has been observed  @xcite that the componentwise ratio of the second to first eigenvector of @xmath34 is precisely equal to the second eigenvector of the random walk laplacian @xmath73 , whose first eigenvector is a constant vector .",
    "thus , our algorithm is effective because it is a computationally efficient procedure for finding the best normalized cut in the two - dimensional eigenspace of @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath73 on the reweighted graph .",
    "the advantages of using @xmath73 in spectral clustering are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we use synthetic graphs to gain better insight into the differences between operators @xmath17 , @xmath34 , and @xmath39 and the characteristics of graphs for which different operators find better solutions .",
    "lancichinetti and fortunato have proposed an algorithm to generate random graphs with known hierarchical community structure  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath75 nodes are divided into macro communities , which are themselves composed of micro communities , and then edges between nodes are created using mixing parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 designates the fraction of a node s edges that will connect to nodes in a different macro community , and @xmath77 gives the fraction of edges that will connect to nodes in a different micro community within the same macro community .",
    "the remaining @xmath78 fraction of edges link to other nodes within the same micro and macro communities .",
    "these benchmark networks allow us to systematically explore the performance of different spectral clustering approaches .    .",

    "a higher weight is placed on globally important nodes .",

    "we have introduced a spectral bisection approach based on the componentwise ratio of the second to the first eigenvector of @xmath39 , choosing the partition by splitting the sorted vector so as to minimize an appropriate quality measure . comparing the performance of different methods on synthetic graphs with known community structure , we have shown that spectral partitioning using the replicator is better able to recover the underlying community structure , especially in cases where more edges between the two macro communities make it more difficult for the laplacian and symmetric normalized laplacian to identify communities . by reweighting the edges using eigenvector centrality , the replicator assigns more importance to central nodes .",
