    "as the story goes , in 1927 niels bohr asked paul dirac `` what are you working on mr .",
    "dirac ? '' to which dirac replied `` i m trying to take the square root of something . ''",
    "once dirac achieved his goal , to identify the desired operator that squares to the klein - gordon equation , he had not only laid down a description of relativistic electrons replete with spin and antimatter @xcite . as it emerged later , dirac",
    "s very same operator also plays a central role for topological considerations in differential geometry , where the atiyah - singer index theorem addresses its zero modes @xcite .",
    "the zero modes in the topological materials considered today are a direct extension of this connection @xcite .",
    "fundamental symmetries can guarantee that all positive - energy states are paired with negative - energy states , with the exception of a protected set of zero - energy states whose number @xmath0 is obtained from a topological invariant .",
    "these properties may follow from a charge - conjugation symmetry , as encountered in superconductors @xcite , or from a chiral symmetry , as encountered for the dirac operator @xcite ; both operations anticommute with the hamiltonian and therefore single out a spectral symmetry point . in combination with possible invariance under time - reversal ,",
    "these spectral symmetries determine a ten - fold system of universality classes @xcite , which can be further extended by including aspects of dimensionality @xcite and the space group ( i.e. , crystal symmetries ) @xcite  for example , nonsymmorphic symmetries involving fractional lattice translations can replace fundamental symmetries normally associated with fermionic systems @xcite . depending on the universality class",
    ", the topological invariant may take the values @xmath1 , leading to the notion of a @xmath2 invariant , or be any integer , leading to the notion of a @xmath3 invariant .",
    "these topological features are not present in the klein - gordon equation , from which dirac had started to take the square - root of , a task which was non - trivial as it required him to introduce extra components and matrices .",
    "here we describe how rich topological effects arise when one takes an analogous non - trivial square root on a tight - binding lattice .",
    "tight - binding lattices provide an ubiquitous description of electronic bands in crystalline solids , but also extend to atoms and photons in suitably engineered optical and photonic lattices .",
    "this includes topological systems in all universality classes , such as the paradigmatic su - schrieffer - heeger model , originally proposed for polyacetylene @xcite , and non - topological variants such as the rice - mele model for conjugated polymers @xcite , both of which have been implemented on a wide range of platforms @xcite .",
    "both models possess two bands in their clean incarnation .",
    "the ssh model features a chiral symmetry which constraints the bloch states and allows to define a topological winding number @xcite .",
    "defects between regions of different winding number introduce localized , square - normalisable defect states of a fixed chirality that are pinned to the midgap energy . the procedure of taking square roots of lattice systems proposed here provides a mechanism to generated a wider class of models , including models with multiple band gaps , where some of the topological properties can be traced back to features of a parent system while others emerge from the square - root operation . given a suitable parent system with energy bands at positive energies , taking the non - trivial square root",
    "provides us with a symmetric arrangement of energy bands at positive and negative energies .",
    "if the original system harboured 2@xmath0 protected modes around a spectral symmetry point @xmath4 , the new system will harbour @xmath0 protected modes around energy @xmath5 and @xmath0 such modes around energy @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the resulting system can also have topologically protected states around the newly emergent spectral symmetry point @xmath7 , whose formation is controlled by an independent topological invariant .",
    "as we will show , these features arise because the square - root operation allows us to induce ( typically nonsymmorphic ) _ spectral _ symmetries at the expense of broken _ crystal _ symmetries .",
    "we justify this proposition with some general preparatory remarks ( section  [ sec : prep ] ) , and then demonstrate the resulting features by deriving a simple minimal model that complies with the properties mentioned above ( section  [ sec : bowtie ] ) . applying a @xmath2 gauge transformation ,",
    "the derived system takes the form of a bow - tie chain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which displays a chiral symmetry involving a fractional lattice translation ; the system can also be interpreted as a topological extension of the rice - mele model shown in fig .",
    "the bow - tie chain allows to explicitly demonstrate the topological nature of the different bands , band gaps and interfaces , as expressed via topological zak phases , generalized witten indices , and their mismatch at boundaries and defects ( see section [ sec : top ] and figs .",

    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) . beyond the setting of this paradigmatic model",
    ", we then consolidate our general criterion whether a square root of a tight - binding system qualifies as non - trivial  the resulting system has to exhibit reduced crystal symmetries , manifested e.g. via additional components that give rise to an increased number of bands with newly emerging spectral symmetries  and identify a number of systems in higher dimensions where this is encountered as well ( see section [ sec : general ] as well figs .",
    "[ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] ) .",

    "the topological properties of the su - schrieffer - heeger model can be associated with the chiral symmetry @xmath46 @xcite , which lifts the system into a topologically non - trivial universality class .",
    "it is also useful to note that the chiral operator @xmath47 constitutes a special case of a @xmath2 gauge transformation , in general given by @xmath48 with independently chosen @xmath49 .",
    "such a gauge transformation allows to change the sign of off - diagonal elements ( couplings ) in a tight - binding hamiltonian .      for further motivation ,",
    "let us have a more general look at periodic tight - binding systems with bloch hamiltonian @xmath50 , which may include an arbitrary range of the couplings , and explore a particular consequence of a chiral symmetry @xmath51",
    ". it will be consistent with the following discussions to set the dimensions of this hamiltonian to @xmath52 , as it is our goal to relate it to a parent hamiltonian with only @xmath19 components .",

    "the upshot of this discussion is the following proposition : taking a square root of a parent tight - binding system as described by @xmath73 , it can be possible to break crystal symmetries , at the expense of an expanded unit cell with twice as many components and a brillouin zone half in size , and in the process generate a chiral symmetry @xmath74 that induces spectrally symmetric bands . we will show that this can indeed be achieved , including in cases where the band structure is already topological , resulting in a non - trivial square - root system which displays richer topological features .",
    "in particular , we construct a practically realisable model system that only features nearest - neighbour couplings .",
    "according to the features described in the preceding section , we require that our minimal parent system features a band gap about a spectral symmetry point ; the unit cell therefore needs to comprise at least two sites ( @xmath32 ) . to be non - trivial",
    ", the square - root system will have to have four bands , thus , be periodic with period 2 in the original unit - cell indices .",
    "together with the required spectral symmetries , this allows to identify a minimal model , which will turn out to correspond to the bow - tie chain depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    to implement these constraints we start with the putative non - trivial square root system ( termed the ` candidate ' ) and iterate the tight - binding equations once , giving @xmath75 where",
    "@xmath76    [ eq : iter2 ]    we interpret this as a new tight - binding system , describing the parent system with a positive energy spectrum .",
    "this parent system should be periodic , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , with vanishing next - nearest neighbour couplings @xmath79 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , taking the rice - mele model as the candidate this construction leads to a parent system consisting of two uncoupled chains with onsite energies @xmath13 and couplings @xmath15 ; the rice - mele model then constitutes a trivial square root without any newly emerging topological features , consistent with the fact that it still has the same period as its parent .    to ensure that we obtain a non - trivial square root , with four bands arranged symmetrically about @xmath7 , we demand that the candidate system has a period of two , and possesses a chiral symmetry which maps @xmath22 to @xmath80 .",
    "this can be enforced by the choice @xmath81 the chiral symmetry is induced by a translation @xmath82 , thus , a fractional translation by half a period of the candidate system .",
    "this spectral symmetry is trivial in the parent system , and therefore emerges only upon taking the square root , at the expense of a reduced translational crystal symmetry .",
    "the constraint @xmath79 requires @xmath83 .",
    "the freedom to choose the basis in every cell then allows us to write @xmath84 which defines the minimal non - trivial square root system .",
    "its parent system is given by    @xmath85    via a suitable @xmath2 gauge transformation we can enforce that the couplings @xmath86 are real and nonnegative , which we will assume from hereon .      with help of fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , we now can confirm that the parent hamiltonian corresponds to a two - legged ladder , with onsite energies @xmath13 , couplings @xmath15 and @xmath87 along the two legs and coupling @xmath88 along the rungs . given the opposite couplings along the legs , each plaquette is penetrated by a flux phase of @xmath89 .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian of the parent is @xmath90 and the two energy bands are @xmath91    as depicted in the figure , the non - trivial square root system can be unfolded into a linear chain , where all couplings are still restricted to nearest neighbours ( see the appendix for a very detailed description ) . along the chain , the system then displays a repeating coupling sequence @xmath10 , @xmath9 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and a repeating sequence of onsite energies @xmath35 , @xmath35 , @xmath34 , @xmath34 .",
    "we interpret this as an extended rice - mele model , but with topological features that we establish in the next section .",
    "for the photonic implementation we will make all couplings positive by an additional @xmath2 gauge transformation ; schematically , the system is then composed of oppositely orientated dimers that form the repeating bow - tie pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for the analytical considerations , it is more convenient to retain the system with the coupling sequence as derived .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian of the unfolded linear chain is @xmath94 and the four energy bands are @xmath95 where the label @xmath96 selects the bands at positive and negative energies .",
    "the four bands thus come in two pairs , covering the ranges    @xmath97    [ eq : edges ]    separated by gaps at    @xmath98    the band edges are given by    @xmath99    these expressions feature an index @xmath100 which changes its sign when the central gap closes while parameters are steered through a band inversion of the inner bands .",
    "analogously , the index @xmath101 changes its sign in a band inversion in which the finite - energy gaps close ( @xmath41 , where we recover the su - schrieffer - heeger model with only a single , central , gap ) .    the indices @xmath102 and @xmath103 encode information which can not be inferred by simply inspecting the band structure  the same band structure is found when one changes the sign of @xmath35 , which changes the sign of @xmath12 ; the band structure is also invariant when one passes over to parameters @xmath104 which changes the sign of @xmath102 . in figs .",
    "[ fig3]-[fig5 ] , the four cases delivering the same band structure are distinguished via the orientation of the dimers ( which effectively controls the sign of @xmath35 and thus @xmath103 ) , while dimers with @xmath105 are denoted in orange - brown , and dimers with @xmath106 are denoted in blue . as we show next , the indices @xmath102 and @xmath103 indeed capture the topological features of the band structure .",
    "to establish the topological features of the bow - tie chain , we identify its symmetries and describe how they relate to the associated topological indices .",
    "the index @xmath102 arises from the chiral symmetry that emerges by taking the square root , while the index @xmath103 is inherited from the chiral symmetry of the parent system and translates into an uncommon algebraic property of the linear chain .",
    "these indices can be expressed in terms of winding numbers in the bands and in the gaps , while interfaces between regions with different indices give rise to topologically protected defect states .",
    "the spectral symmetry @xmath107 of the band structure about @xmath7 is a consequence of the chiral symmetry , which for the bloch hamiltonian takes the form @xmath108 as mentioned before , this symmetry originates from a fractional lattice translation , by half a period of the system .",
    "we also note the relations @xmath109 which correspond to a reflection symmetry and a conventional time - reversal symmetry .",
    "both entail that the bands also are symmetric in @xmath27 , which simplifies the determination of topological indices @xcite .",
    "the spectral symmetry @xmath110 of the squared bands about @xmath111 is the consequence of the chiral symmetry @xmath112 in the parent system . for the unfolded linear chain , this gives the remarkable algebraic relation @xmath113 a property which would be difficult to interpret without knowledge of the underlying parent system .",
    "this inherited spectral symmetry plays an important role throughout the remainder of this work .",
    "given these symmetries , applying the conventional classification of free - fermion models we expect that the topological features in the central gap can be captured by the symmetry class bdi for chiral systems with a conventional time - reversal symmetry @xcite , i.e. , the same symmetry class as for the ssh model . as explained in the appendix by adapting the considerations in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same expectation is born out when we take into account that the chiral symmetry encountered in our model is nonsymmorphic .",
    "for the finite - energy gaps , we arrive at the same conclusions starting from the topological features of the parent system , which also suggests that the corresponding topological index is independent . to show that these expectations indeed hold true we explicitly construct the topological invariants for the different bands and band gaps .",
    "each band can be associated with a zak phase @xcite @xmath114 this phase depends on a gauge choice , which can be fixed by demanding that the component @xmath115 is real and positive . in topological systems ,",

    "given the amplitudes @xmath20 in a cell , the tight - binding equations at fixed energy @xmath22 allow to determine the amplitudes in the next cell as @xmath120 .",
    "the matrix @xmath121 then describes the transfer by two cells , thus a period of the square - root system .",
    "unitarity of quantum mechanics enforces the symplectic symmetry @xmath122 , which amounts to flux conservation .",

    "this can normally done , e.g. , via the witten index @xcite , which here relates to the reflection phase at a spectral symmetry point @xcite . in the finite - frequency gaps ,",

    "the phase @xmath149 is fixed to the symmetry - protected values @xmath150 or @xmath89 , so that @xmath151 as discussed above . as one crosses the gap , the reflection coefficient winds along the unit circle , which encodes topological information .",
    "as dictated by causality @xcite , the winding is always in the clockwise sense , and in the system considered here , is always by @xmath89 .",

    "since the witten index in the finite energy gap at positive energies is opposite to the one at negative energies , exactly one such finite - energy bound state exists for any given combination of parameters ; in the central gap , the state only exists for some configurations .",

    "this occurs exactly when the witten index of the gap differs on the two sides of the interface .",
    "the central gap supports a topological defect state if @xmath181 , while a topological defect state in both of the finite - frequency gaps appears if @xmath182 .",

    "this system appears to be the most natural extension of the bow - tie chain to two dimensions .        as a third example , we consider honeycomb systems such as graphene @xcite .",

    "the lost crystal symmetries may be replaced by new spectral constraints , as exemplified by the chiral symmetry in the bow - tie chain ; additional features such as a chiral symmetry of the parent system yield further nontrivial constraints , as exemplified by eq .  .",

    "we identified the simplest non - trivial one - dimensional example , the bow - tie chain , and found that it possesses a rich topological band structure , providing means to generate a versatile combination of edge and interface states .",
