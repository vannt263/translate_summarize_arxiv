    "its 2d - analogue , however , was answered long time ago by tutte @xcite , who proved that there are asymptotically fewer than @xmath7 combinatorial types of triangulated @xmath8-spheres .",

    "why are @xmath8-spheres `` not so many '' ?",
    "every combinatorial type of triangulation of the @xmath8-sphere can be generated as follows ( figure [ fig : treetriangles ] ) : first for some even @xmath10 build a tree of @xmath4 triangles ( which combinatorially is the same thing as a triangulation of an ( @xmath11)-gon ) , and then glue edges according to a complete matching of the boundary edges .",
    "a necessary condition in order to obtain a @xmath8-sphere is that such a matching is _",
    "planar_. planar matchings and triangulations of ( @xmath11)-gons are both enumerated by a catalan number @xmath12 , and since the catalan numbers satisfy a polynomial bound @xmath13 , we get an exponential upper bound for the number of triangulations .     triangles ( i.e. , a triangulated @xmath14-gon).,title=\"fig:\"]-4 mm    neither this simple argument nor tutte s precise count can be easily extended to higher dimensions .",
    "indeed , we have to deal with three different problems when trying to extend results or methods from dimension two to dimension three :    many combinatorial types of simplicial @xmath0-spheres are not realizable as boundaries of convex @xmath15-polytopes ; thus , even though we observe below that there are only exponentially - many simplicial @xmath15-polytopes with @xmath4 facets , the @xmath0-spheres could still be more numerous .",
    "the counts of combinatorial types according to the number @xmath16 of vertices and according to the number @xmath4 of facets are not equivalent any more .",

    "if , on the other hand , we restrict ourselves to `` local gluings '' , we generate only a limited family of @xmath0-spheres , as we will show below .    in the early nineties , new finiteness theorems by cheeger @xcite and grove et al .",
    "@xcite yielded a new approach , namely , to count @xmath1-manifolds of `` fluctuating topology '' ( not necessarily spheres ) but `` bounded geometry '' ( curvature and diameter bounded from above , and volume bounded from below ) .",
    "this allowed bartocci et al .",
    "@xcite to bound for any @xmath1-manifold the number of triangulations with @xmath4 or more facets , under the assumption that no vertex had degree higher than a fixed integer",
    ". however , for this it is crucial to restrict the topological type : already for @xmath20 , there are more than exponentially many triangulated @xmath8-manifolds of bounded vertex degree with @xmath4 facets .    in 1995",
    ", the physicists durhuus and jonsson @xcite introduced the class of `` locally constructible '' ( lc ) @xmath0-spheres .",
    "an lc @xmath0-sphere ( with @xmath4 facets ) is a sphere obtainable from a tree of @xmath4 tetrahedra , by identifying pairs of adjacent triangles in the boundary .",
    "`` adjacent '' means here `` sharing at least one edge '' , and represents a dynamic requirement . clearly , every @xmath0-sphere is obtainable from a tree of @xmath4 tetrahedra by matching the triangles in its boundary ; according to the definition of lc , however , we are allowed to match only those triangles that _ are _ adjacent  or that have _ become _ adjacent by the time of the gluing .",
    "durhuus and jonsson proved an exponential upper bound on the number of combinatorially distinct lc spheres with @xmath4 facets .",
    "based also on computer simulations ( @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite ) they conjectured that all @xmath0-spheres should be lc .",
    "a positive solution of this conjecture would have implied that spheres with @xmath4 facets are at most @xmath5 , for a constant @xmath6  which would have been the desired missing link to implement discrete quantum gravity in three dimensions .    in the present paper , we show that the conjecture of durhuus and jonsson has a negative answer : there are simplicial @xmath0-spheres that are not lc .",
    "( with this , however , we do not resolve the question whether there are fewer than @xmath5 simplicial @xmath0-spheres on @xmath4 facets , for some constant  @xmath6 . )    on the way to this result , we provide a characterization of lc simplicial @xmath1-complexes which relates the `` locally constructible '' spheres defined by physicists to concepts that originally arose in topological combinatorics .    [ theorem  [ thm : hierarchyspheres ] ] [ mainthm : hierarchyspheres ] a simplicial @xmath1-sphere , @xmath21 , is lc if and only if the sphere after removal of one facet can be collapsed down to a complex of dimension  @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , there are the following inclusion relations between families of simplicial @xmath1-spheres : _ @xmath23 _",
    "we use the hierarchy in conjunction with the following extension and sharpening of durhuus and jonsson s theorem ( who discussed only the case @xmath24 ) .",

    ".    we will give a proof for this theorem in section  [ sec : numbers ] ; the same type of upper bound , with the same type of proof , also holds for lc @xmath1-balls with @xmath4 facets .    already in 1988",
    "kalai @xcite constructed for every @xmath27 a family of more than exponentially many @xmath1-spheres on @xmath16 vertices ; lee @xcite later showed that all of kalai s spheres are shellable . combining this with theorem  [ thm : announced ] and theorem  [ thm : hierarchyspheres ] , we obtain the following asymptotic result :    for fixed @xmath27 , the number of shellable simplicial @xmath1-spheres grows more than exponentially with respect to the number @xmath16 of vertices , but only exponentially with respect to the number @xmath4 of facets .",
    "the hierarchy of main theorem  [ mainthm : hierarchyspheres ] is not quite complete : it is still not known whether constructible , non - shellable @xmath0-spheres exist ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we proceed this way until all the @xmath382 facets in the boundary of @xmath183 have been matched ( after @xmath383 steps , say ) .",
    "clearly @xmath384 , and since the @xmath385 s are positive integers , @xmath386 must hold .",
    "this means there are at most @xmath387 possible perfect matchings of @xmath37-simplices in the boundary of a tree of @xmath4 @xmath1-simplices .",
    "we sharpen this bound by observing that not all ridges may be chosen in the first round of identifications . for example , we should exclude those ridges that belong to just two @xmath1-simplices of @xmath183 .",
    "an easy double - counting argument reveals that in a tree of @xmath1-simplices , the number of ridges belonging to at least 3 @xmath1-simplices is less than or equal to @xmath388 .",
    "so in the upper bound above we may replace the first factor @xmath389 with the smaller factor @xmath390 .",
    "to bound the sum from above , we use @xmath391 and @xmath392 , while ignoring the conditions @xmath393 . thus we obtain the upper bound @xmath394 the factor @xmath395 is asymptotically negligible",
    ". thus the number of ways to fold a tree of @xmath4 @xmath1-simplices into a sphere via a local construction sequence is smaller than @xmath396 . combining this with proposition [ prop : countdtrees ] , we conclude the proof for the case of @xmath1-spheres .",

    "the upper bound of theorem  [ thm : announced ] can be simplified in many ways .",
    "for example , for @xmath397 it is smaller than @xmath398{4}^{d^2 n}$ ] . from theorem [ thm : announced ]",
    "we obtain explicit upper bounds :        and so on .",
    "we point out that these upper bounds are not sharp , as we overcounted both on the combinatorial side and on the algebraic side .",
    "when @xmath20 , tutte s upper bound is asymptotically @xmath401 , whereas the one given by our formula is @xmath402 . when @xmath24 , however , our constant is smaller than what follows from durhuus ",
    "jonsson s original argument :      for the count of trees of tetrahedra we obtain an essentially sharp bound of @xmath405 .",
    "( the value implicit in the durhuus  jonsson argument @xcite is larger since one has to take into account that different trees of tetrahedra can have the same unlabeled dual graph . )      we have just obtained an upper bound ; we also get a lower bound from proposition [ prop : countdtrees]/corollary [ cor : exponentialbounds ] , since the boundary of a tree of @xmath276-simplices is a stacked @xmath1-sphere , and for @xmath62 the stacked @xmath1-sphere determines the tree of @xmath276-simplices uniquely .",
    "we know very little about the number of lc @xmath1-spheres with @xmath4 facets when @xmath1 is not constant and @xmath4 is relatively small ( say , bounded by a polynomial ) in terms of @xmath1  and whether the lc condition is crucial for that .",
