    "on a wireless channel , diversity techniques are used to combat channel fadings .",
    "recently , there has been a growing interest in the so called _ cooperative diversity _ techniques , where multiple terminals in a network cooperate to form a virtual antenna array in order to exploit spatial diversity in a distributed fashion . in this manner",
    ", spatial diversity gain can be obtained even when a local antenna array is not available . since the work of @xcite , several cooperative transmission protocols have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these protocols can be categorized into two principal classes  : the amplify - and - forward  ( af ) scheme and the decode - and - forward  ( df ) scheme . in practice ,",
    "the af scheme is more attractive for its low complexity since the cooperative terminals  ( relays ) simply forward the signal and do not decode it .",
    "actually , for most _ ad hoc _ wireless networks , it is not realistic for other terminals to decode the signal from a certain user , because the codebook is seldom available and the decoding complexity is unacceptable in most cases .",
    "the non - orthogonal amplify - and - forward  ( naf ) scheme was proposed by nabar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the single - relay channel and was then generalized to the multiple - relay case by azarian _",
    "et al._@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the naf scheme outperforms all previously proposed af schemes in terms of the fundamental diversity - multiplexing tradeoff  ( dmt)@xcite and that it is optimal within the class of af schemes in the single - relay case .",
    "the superiority of the naf scheme comes from the fact that the source terminal is allowed to transmit during all the time , which boosts up the multiplexing gain .",
    "however , even though they showed that the dmt of this scheme can be achieved using a gaussian random code of sufficiently large block length , no practical coding scheme that achieves the tradeoff has been proposed since then .",
    "the main contributions of our work are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we extend the single - antenna naf scheme proposed in @xcite to the multiple - antenna case .",
    "we establish a lower bound on the optimal dmt of the mimo naf channel . in particular , we show that the maximum diversity order of a single - relay mimo naf channel is lower - bounded by the sum of the maximum diversity order of the source - destination channel and the maximum diversity orders of the source - relay - destination product channels .",
    "this lower bound is tight when the source , relay and destination antenna number @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfy @xmath25 2 .",
    "we provide an explicit algebraic construction of _ short _ block codes that achieves the optimal dmt of the general multiple - antenna multiple - relay naf cooperative diversity scheme .",
    "our algebraic code construction is inspired by the non - vanishing determinant  ( nvd ) space - time codes design for mimo rayleigh channels  @xcite .",
    "first , we show that for any linear fading gaussian channel  ( not only the rayleigh channel as in @xcite ) @xmath26 in the high snr regime , the error event of a `` good '' space - time code @xmath27  ( which will be properly defined later ) occurs only when the channel is in outage . therefore , the optimal dmt can always be achieved by @xmath27 .",
    "then , as in @xcite , we derive equivalent signal models of the af cooperative schemes in the form  ( [ eq : linear_model ] ) , subject to certain input constraint  ( _ e.g. _ , block diagonal for multiple - relay channel ) .",
    "since codes that achieve the optimal dmt of the equivalent channel  ( [ eq : linear_model ] ) also achieve the optimal dmt of the corresponding cooperative channel , optimal codes for an af cooperative channel can be obtained from the nvd criterion . as a result",
    ", we show that for a single - relay af channel with @xmath22 antennas at the source terminal , a @xmath28 full rate nvd space - time code  ( _ e.g. _ , the golden code  @xcite for the single - antenna case and the @xmath1 perfect code  @xcite for the two - antenna case ) can be directly applied to construct an optimal block code . in the @xmath0-relay case ,",
    "the optimal code is constructed from a block - diagonal nvd space - time code with @xmath0 blocks .",
    "the performance of our construction is confirmed by simulation results .",

    "maximum diversity gain is obtained without a superframe structure , which means a significant reduction of coding - decoding complexity .    as an example , let us consider a @xmath105 relay channel with @xmath106 . in this case , the received signal at the relay can be projected into a one - dimensional subspace .",
    "consider a superframe of @xmath23 cooperation frames .",
    "in each cooperation frame , a different relay antenna is used .",
    "this scheme is virtually an @xmath0-relay single - antenna channel .",
    "the only difference is that the equivalent source - relay link , which is @xmath107 after the matched filter operation , is the same for the @xmath0 virtual relays . in this scheme ,",
    "the achievable diversity order of the source - relay - destination link is @xmath23 , since the channel is in outage only when @xmath107 is in deep fade or all the @xmath23 relay - destination links are in deep fade . when feedback is possible , the antenna selection scheme can be used .",
    "the difference from the first scheme is that only the antenna with maximum relay - destination channel gain  ( say , @xmath108 ) is used in the relaying phase .",
    "therefore , only one cooperation frame is needed and the diversity order is also @xmath23 .      with the discussion above , considering the case",
    "@xmath75 is without loss of generality .",
    "in addition , since the destination is usually equipped with more antennas than the relays are in practice , we will restrict ourselves to the case @xmath109 hereafter .",
    "in the rest of this section , we study the optimal dmt of the mimo naf cooperative channel . unlike the single - antenna case , a closed form expression of the dmt of the mimo naf channel is difficult to obtain , since the probability distribution  ( in the high snr regime or not ) of the eigenvalues of @xmath94 defined in ( [ eq : channelh_mimo ] ) is unknown . in the following",
