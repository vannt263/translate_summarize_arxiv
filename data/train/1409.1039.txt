    "the general aim of our work is the `` visualization and verbalization of data '' @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the data here is the narrative of the flow of tweets ( microblogs ) in the online ( web 3.0 ) social medium , twitter .",
    "the general approach to analysis of twitter conversations taken in @xcite is based on hashtags ( terms preceded with the character `` # '' which can be cross - referenced in twitter ) and users ( preceded with the `` @ '' character ) .",
    "more than 10 connections were required between users ( a connection of a user to another being the explicit use of each other s `` @ '' names ) and a graph of such exchanges was used for community analysis .",
    "the latter , in the case of @xcite , was primarily aimed at the pro and contra viewpoints relative to climate change .",
    "based on such polarization of views , and greater prevalence of tweeting in the unsupportive - to - supportive direction ( relative to action to counteract climate change ) , it was nonetheless concluded that more work was required : `` content analysis of the tweets could be a possible qualitative approach that could shed light on [ ... ] and provide new knowledge about the content of conversational connections discovered ... '' . in our work in this article , we look at the conversational connections starting from what is aiming at being an initiating , instigational and influencing tweet .    in @xcite , twitter - based behaviour ( relating to the 2009 h1n1 swine flu ) was subjected to content analysis that included analysis of retweets , seeking particular words and phrases , and manual labelling for content and sentiment characterization , followed by analysis of that .",
    "such work was carried out by querying the twitter data .",
    "the queries were sophisticated with many boolean connectives ( `` and '' , `` or '' , etc . ) . rather than a querying , matching and supervised approach such as this , and used in general for sentiment analysis , our work in this article will be data - driven and unsupervised .",
    "we will map out the underlying semantics of our social media data through the text .",
    "the text used provides the `` sensory surface '' @xcite of the underlying semantics .",
    "social media monitoring was originally adopted by public relations and advertising agencies , who used it as a means to identify negative comments posted on the web about their clients @xcite .",
    "it is defined as the activity of observing and tracking content on the social web .",
    "each activity on social media has an outcome , or effect , which can be measured by observing and then quantifying specific behaviours .",
    "effects can be one of the following : retweets , mentions , favourites , follows , likes , shares , comments , sentiment .",
    "social media are used by companies and public relations agencies , by local and central governments , who all seek to evaluate the use of social media channels as a communication or engagement tool . in the evaluation of online success of museums @xcite , and the social media metric for us federal agencies @xcite",
    ", the emphasis is not on evaluating social media efforts for marketing purposes , but to provide organisations with tools to be able to understand if their efforts in engaging citizens have been successful and , crucially , what defines success .",
    "it is specifically the emphasis on engagement and collaboration with citizens that makes these approaches different from the marketing strategies , which are more focused on connecting companies with their clients .    of direct relevance to our second case study",
    "is our previous work , as follows .",
    "we @xcite used tools that are freely available on - line to analyse social media traffic .",
    "the most basic form of effectiveness thus becomes creating social media conversation .",
    "this includes attracting more and new people , engaging them in different actions , and assessing how they participate in conversations both theme - wise and among themselves .",
    "four main measurement approaches were used : ( 1 ) growth of community , ( 2 ) engagement ( e.g.  retweets ) , ( 3 ) content indicators , and ( 4 ) conversations ( e.g.  number of these ) . for each category",
    "different metrics were defined and compared , using , as we have noted , publicly available software tools .",
    "we @xcite concluded : `` ... although useful in understanding the effectiveness of a communication campaign in its numerical terms , the proposed methodology can only be the first step of a more in - depth investigation about what people can learn during their on - line participation , and what is the perceived impact of the process on them , behaviour- or citizenship - wise .",
    "consequently a more in - depth analysis of the characteristic of the community and a content analysis of on - line conversations is necessary ... '' . in this present work",
    "we are primarily focused on the content analysis of on - line ( twitter ) conversations .",
    "we seek to analyse the semantics of the discourse in a data - driven way .",
    "the following is concluded by @xcite : `` top - down communication campaigns both predominate and are advised by those involved in ` social marketing ' ... .",
    "however , this rarely manifests itself through measurable behaviour change ... '' .",
    "thus our approach is , in its point of departure and vantage point , bottom - up .",
    "i.e.  our approach is based on the observable data .",
    "mediated by the latent semantic mapping of the discourse , we will develop semantic distance measures between deliberative actions and the aggregate social effect .",
    "we let the data speak ( a benzcri quotation , noted in @xcite ) in regard to influence , impact and reach .",
    "twitter data presents all sorts of problems for word , or certainly more so for linguistic , analysis .",
    "one example from the stephen fry tweets that we use is the following that is part of a tweet : `` too twired to teet , too mailed out to e - shag . ''",
    "( the first part of this play on words and language is referring to `` too tired to tweet '' , and the second part has even more play on words relating to `` e - mail '' and the informal expression for being very tired , `` to be shagged '' ) .",
    "another example is a mention of the city of manchester as `` madchester '' with its `` reet pleased ( note stunningly accurate mancunian accent ) '' .",
    "there are many further examples of informal expressions , `` gr8ly '' meaning `` greatly '' , and some use of languages other than english ( an exchange in dutch , culinary terms in french . )",
    "one result of our work is to show how semantic properties of words extracted from twitter are usable in practical , application - oriented analysis , that is lexically - based , and that has potential for revealing the underlying or latent semantics . since our analysis takes into account all pairwise relationships , specified through shared associations , therefore there is incorporation of context of words and their use . from the comprehensive set of relationships between tweets , between words , and between tweets and words , we have the basis for analysis of semantics .",
    "the methodology used is based on a latent semantic , metric space embedding followed , if desired , by induction of a hierarchical clustering , also expressed as the inducing of an ultrametric or rooted tree topology .      in our first case study , we take impactful tweets and study their role in the twitter narrative . in the second case study , we take twitter data from a carefully planned campaign to influence through twitter the environmentally - conscious attitudes as manifested in the twitter medium .",
    "we apply the approach used in @xcite to take the text of a narrative and divide it into lexically homogeneous subsequences or parts , and coupled with this , to detect natural breakpoints in the narrative flow .",
    "the advantage of the geometric data analysis approach used in @xcite is that the structure of the narrative , and the semantic flow , are revealed in a bottom - up manner , based on the actual textual data .",
    "our geometrical data analysis approach uses corresponence analysis in order to map out `` the flow of thought and the flow of language '' @xcite in a euclidean metric , latent semantic factor space . from that factor space , a hierarchical topology",
    "is determined , and this hierarchy express the semantics at a continuum of resolutions or scales .    unlike previous work that uses geometric data analysis on textually - expressed narrative , including @xcite , here in this work we are involved with social media data where the narrative is much more diffuse and less focused .",
    "twitter , consisting of streams of text messages called tweets that are each a maximum of 140 characters in length , is very often a dialogue with other tweeters , with names preceded by the `` at '' sign , @ , and frequently there is reference to topics that are made linkable through being preceded by the hash symbol , @xmath0 . in our work here , we use a single tweeter s flow of tweets .",
    "firstly , we map out a narrative from an individual tweeter s vantage point .",
    "secondly , we develop new approaches for assessing effect , and impact if the effect is successful , from within the tweeter s narrative flow .      when in october 2009 , the actor , presenter and celebrity stephen fry announced his retirement from twitter to his near 1 million followers , it was a newsworthy event .",
    "it was reported @xcite that ",
    "fry s disagreement with another tweeter began when the latter said ` i admire and adore ' fry , but that he found his tweets ` a bit ... boring ... ( sorry stephen ) ' .",
    "the tweeter , who said that he had been blocked from viewing fry s twitter feed , later apologised and acknowledged that fry suffers from bipolar disorder .",
    "    having caused major impact among his followers and wider afield , fry actually returned to twitter , nearly immediately , having had an apology from the offending tweeter , @brumplum .",
    "the two crucial tweets of stephen fry s were as follows .",
    "( in discussion below , we refer to them as , respectively , the `` i retire '' tweet or the `` aggression '' tweet . )    6:09 a.m. on 31 october 2009 : + @brumplum you ve convinced me .",
    "i m obviously not good enough .",
    "i + retire from twitter henceforward .",
    ".    6.13 a.m. on 31 october 2009 : + think i may have to give up on twitter .",
    "too much aggression and + unkindness around .",
    "well , it s been fun .    in order to look at those decisive tweets in context",
    ", we took a set of 302 of fry s tweets , spanning the critical early morning of 31 october 2009 .",
    "these were from 22 october 2009 to 22 november 2009 .",
    "words are collected from the 302 tweets .",
    "initially we have 1787 unique words defined as follows : containing more than one consecutive letter ; with punctuation and special characters deleted ( hence with modification of short urls , hashtags or twitter names preceded by an at sign , but , for our purposes not detracting from our interest in semantic content ) ; and with no lemmatization nor other processing , in order to leave us with all available emotially - laden or emotionally - indicative function words . for our analysis",
    "we do require a certain amount of sharing of words by the tweets .",
    "otherwise there will be isolated tweets ( that are disconnected through no shared terms ) .",
    "so we select words depending on two thresholds : a minimum global frequency and a minimum number of tweets for which the word is used .",
    "both thresholds were set to 5 ( determined as a compromise between a good overlap between tweets in terms of word presence , yet not removing an overly large number of words ) .",
    "this led to 143 words retained for the 302 tweets .",
    "a repercussion is that some tweets became empty of words : 293 were non - empty , out of the 302 tweet set .    for high dimensional word usage spaces , it is normal for correspondence analysis to have a lack of concentration of inertia in the succession of factors ( cf .",
    "appendix b ) , that is to say , the latent semantic factors are of relatively similar importance . hence , we developed an analysis methodology as outlined in the following sections .",
    "first we pursued the following analysis approach .",
    "taking the two crucial tweets noted in section [ shock ] , there were 33 words , as follows .    ``",
    "to '' , `` and '' , `` it '' , `` on '' , `` you '' , `` me '' , `` not '' , `` have '' , `` up '' , `` too '' , `` from '' , `` good '' , `` well '' , `` think '' , `` ve '' , `` been '' , `` may '' , `` much '' , `` twitter '' , `` fun '' , `` brumplum '' , `` enough'',``everyone '' , `` give '' , `` obviously '' , `` aggression '' , `` around '' , `` bye '' , `` convinced '' , `` henceforward '' , `` pity'',``retire '' , `` unkindness ''    ( note `` ve '' , from `` have '' , due to the removal of an apostrophe . )",
    "then we seek out all other tweets that use at least one of these words . that resulted in 225 out of the total of 302 tweets being retained .",
    "figure [ fry1 ] positions our two critical tweets in a best planar projection of the tweets and associated words . in figure",
    "[ fry1 ] , the contribution to the inertia of factor 1 by the `` aggression '' tweet is the greatest among all tweets , and the contribution to the inertia of factor 2 by the `` i retire '' tweet is the greatest among all tweets .",
    "while useful for finding dominant themes ( expressed by the words used in the tweets ) , and perhaps also for the trajectory of these themes , we can use the full dimenensionality of the latent semantic representation of this twitter data by clustering the tweets , based on their ( euclidean metric ) factor projections .",
    "we use a chronologically ( or sequence ) constrained complete link agglomerative hierarchical clustering .",
    "see @xcite for this hierarchical clustering approach .        .",
    "our two critical tweets are the 166th and 167th ones here , the `` i retire '' and `` aggression '' tweets .",
    "section [ shock].),width=453 ]    figure [ fry2 ] displays this hierarchical clustering of the twitter narrative .",
    "figure [ fry2b ] is a close - up view of part of the dendrogram .",
    "our crucial tweets are located at the end of a fairly compact clustering structure .",
    "this points to how our two crucial tweets can be considered as bringing a sub - narrative to a conclusion .",
    "our interest is therefore raised in finding sub - narratives in the twitter flow .",
    "these sub - narratives are sought here as chronologically successive tweets , i.e.  a segment in the chronological flow of tweets .      to investigate our two critical tweets , such as the immediate or other precursors , and the repercussions or subsequent evolution of the twitter narrative , we will now determine sub - narratives in the overall twitter narrative .",
    "this we will do through segmentation of the flow of tweets .",
    "so a sub - narrative is defined as a segment of this flow of tweets .",
    "that is , the sub - narrative consists of groups ( or clusters ) of successive tweets that are semantically homogeneous .",
    "semantic homogeneity is defined through a statistical significance approach .",
    "we return now to the full , original word set .    on the full set of tweets and the words used in these tweets ,",
    "a threshold of 5 tweets was required for each word , and the total number of occurrences of words needed to be at least 5 .",
    "this lowered our word set , initially 1787 , to 143 .",
    "then we removed stopwords , and partial words , in a list that we made : `` the '' , `` to '' , `` and '' , `` of '' , `` in . '' , `` it '' , `` is '' , `` for . '' , `` that '' , `` on '' , `` at '' , `` be '' , `` this '' , `` what '' , `` an '' , `` if . '' , `` ve '' , `` don '' , `` ly '' , `` th '' , `` tr '' , `` ll '' . that led to 121 words retained .",
    "there remained 280 non - empty tweets ( from the inital set of 302 tweets ) .",
    "our two critical tweets ( the `` i retire '' and the `` aggression '' ones ) were among the retained tweet set .",
    "following correspondence analysis of the 280 tweets crossed by 121 words , an agglomerative hierarchical clustering was applied on the full - dimensionality factor space coordinates .",
    "the chronological sequence of tweets was hierarchically clustered . with the set of 280 tweets , crossed by the 121 word set , figure [ fry3 ]",
    "shows the chronological hierarchical clustering .",
    "our two critical tweets are in their chronological sequence in the 280-tweet sequence ( at the 211th and 212th tweet positions in this sequence ) .",
    "a note follows now on why we did not use hashtag words ( themes referred to ) , or at - sign prefaced words ( other tweeters by twitter name ) .",
    "the hashtag was not used all that often , the usages being : # media140 , # thearchers , # frys , # frys , # 140conf , # grandslamdarts , # pdc ( previous two generally together ) , # webwar , # threestrikes ( previous two together always ) , # svuk",
    ". the total number of at - sign names was 86 .",
    "this was insufficient to base our entire analysis on twitter names , even if hashtag themes were added .        to exploit the visualization of the twitter narrative that is expressed in figure [ fry3 ]",
    ", we will summarize this visualization by determining a segmentation of the flow of tweets .",
    "that is equivalently expressed as determining a partition of tweets from the dendrogram . furthermore ,",
    "as described in the next subsection , we look for internal nodes of the dendrogram that are statistically significant ( using the approach that will now be described ) .      in line with @xcite",
    ", we made these agglomerations subject to a permutation test to authorize or not each agglomeration that is deemed to be significant . in the description that now follows for determining significant segments of tweets",
    ", we follow very closely @xcite .",
    "statistical significance is that the agglomerands validly form a single segment .",
    "all the distances between pairs of objects of the two adjacent groups that are candidates for agglomeration are computed .",
    "these distances are divided into two groups : 50% of the distances with the highest values are coded with 1 and 50% with the lowest values are coded with 0 .",
    "the count of high distances is denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the count of high distances between permuted groups is also computed .",
    "the number of permutations producing a result equal to or over @xmath1 , divided by the number of permutations that are performed , gives an estimate of the probability @xmath2 of observing the data under the null hypothesis ( the objects in the two groups are drawn from the same statistical population and , consequently , it is only an artefact of the agglomerative clustering algorithm that they temporarily form two groups ) .",
    "probability @xmath2 is compared with a pre - established significance level @xmath3 . if @xmath4 , the null hypothesis is accepted and the fusion of the two groups is carried out . if @xmath5 , the null hypothesis is rejected and fusion of the groups is prevented .",
    "changing the value of @xmath3 changes the resolution of the partition obtained , which is what is obtained when the sequence of agglomerations is not allowed to go to its culmination point ( of just one cluster containing all entities being clustered ) .",
    "an @xmath3 significance level of 0.15 was set ( giving an intermediate number of segments between not too large , if @xmath3 were set to a greater value , or a small number of segments if the significance level were more demanding , i.e.  smaller in value ) .",
    "assessment of significance used 5000 permutations ( found to be very stable relative to a number of permutations that were a few hundred upwards ) .",
    "the number of segments found was 40 .",
    "a factor space mapping of these 40 segments was determined , in their 121-word space .",
    "four of these segments ( 6th , 18th , 36th , 39th ) had just one tweet .",
    "since they would therefore quite possibly perturb the correspondence analysis , in being exceptional in this way , we took these particular tweets as supplementary tweets .",
    "this means that the correspondence analysis factor space ( i.e.  the latent semantic space endowed with the euclidean metric ) was determined using the active set of 40 less these four tweets , and then the four supplementary tweets were projected into the factor space .",
    "the mapping is shown in figure [ fry4 ] .",
    "it is noticeable that segment group 30 , that contains our critical tweets towards the end of it , is very close to the origin , which is the average tweet here .",
    "the average tweet can be taken as the most innocuous .",
    "therefore the factor plane of factors 1 and 2 is not useful for saying anything further about segment group 30 , beyond the fact that it is fully unremarkable .    the contributions of segment group 30 to the factors 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 are , respectively 0.04 , 1.71 , 9.94 , 1.62 , 0.27 .",
    "we will look at factors 2,3 because they are determined far more ( than the other factors here ) by segment group 30 .",
    "figure [ fry6 ] displays the words that are of greater contribution to the mean inertia of factors 2 and 3 .",
    "we note that figure [ fry7 ] displays the important tweet segments in the factors 2,3 plane , i.e.  the tweet segments with contribution to the inertias of these factors that are greater than the mean . the chronological trajectory linking these important tweet segments",
    "is also shown .",
    "early tweet segments are positive on factor 3 .",
    "then there is a phase ( with important tweet segments 21 , 22 , 25 ) that are fairly neutral on factor 3 , but range , first negatively on factor 2 , and then positively . then comes a phase ( through tweet segment 27 ) of strong factor 3 positivity .",
    "recall that positive and negative orientations of factor axes are relative only and contain no judgemental character whatsoever .",
    "with tweet segment 28 , there is a move that is reinforced by tweet segment 30 , containing our crucial two tweets , back towards the other extremity of factor 3 .",
    "further tweet segments then play out their roles on the negative factor 3 half - axis .    in summary",
    "we find the following description of the segment groups .",
    "positive factor 3 : segment group 27 , appearance in la ( los angeles ) ; segment group 28 , relating to appearance on the morning news and entertainment television show `` good day , la '' ; segment group 20 , recording of british science fiction television series , `` dr .  who '' .    negative factor 3 : segment group 34 , cambridge ( england ) and ( london street ) norwich ; segment group 37 , london ( england ) . segment group 32 concerns computer - related purchases and issues , and a london event ; segment group 33 relates to royal geographic society and other events",
    "so our tweet segment of interest , segment group 30 , is between tweets that are mainly dealing with la and the london area . in segment group 30",
    ", there is the alternation with twitter user @brumplum , and also a mention of having arrived in la .",
    "we note therefore these geographic linkages in the twitter vicinity of the crucial tweets relating to `` aggression '' and `` i retire '' .",
    "furthermore we note the transition back to the london area , where events that stephen fry was involved in were based .",
    "the completes our analysis of the stephen fry case study .",
    "we have described initally how we did not find anything remarkable in the narrative flow relating to our two crucial tweets .",
    "then we pursued analysis of sub - narratives , determined by segments of the narrative flow .",
    "we found a number of special characteristics both of , and closely related to , the two crucial tweets .",
    "our next case study relates to the furthering and encouragement of environmental citizenship , i.e.  engagement and responsibility in regard to environmental issues .",
    "the background to this work encompasses the following aspects : ( 1 ) the testing of social media with the aim of designing interventions ; ( 2 ) application to environmental communication initiatives ; and ( 3 ) measuring impact of public engagement theory . the latter aspect is in the ( renowned social and political science theorist ) jrgen habermas sense of public engagement centred on communicative theory . by implication therefore , this points to discourse as a possible route to social learning and environmental citizenship . for us , here , discourse is twitter - based .    in @xcite",
    "we deal with the practical challenge of how on - line activity can actually be measured .",
    "the twitter campaigns set up and used in @xcite  which we use in this work  are considered as discourse - based media and as such they have links with public engagement centred on habermas s communicative theory . in order to define and then measure terms like `` influence '' , `` impact '' and `` reach '' , we sought , in @xcite , to evaluate if this is simply the number of friends , followers , re - tweets or `` like '' in a social media ( twitter , facebook ) setting , and whether such social media actions could be considered , in appropriate circumstances , as an act of citizenship or public engagement .        for us , _",
    "impact _ will be the semantic distance between the initiating action , and the net aggregate outcome",
    ". this can be statistically tested",
    ". it can be visualized .",
    "facets and indeed components of such impact can be further visualized and evaluated .",
    "essential enabling aspects are ( 1 ) the _ data structure input _ , comprising characterization of relevant actions , characterization of the initiating actions ; and for all relevant actions , and the initiating actions , we have their context mode ( called `` campaign '' here ) which allows both intra and inter analyses . ( 2 ) _ mapping _ of this characterization data ( presence / absence , frequency of occurrence , mode category ) _ into a semantic space _ that is both qualitatively ( through visualization ) and quantitatively analyzed .",
    "this semantic space is a euclidean , factor space .",
    "for visualization we use 2-dimensional projection , but for quantitative analysis , we use the full factor space dimensionality , hence with no loss of information .",
    "the eight campaigns in late 2012 were as follows , with the date during which the campaign was carried out , and the theme of the campaign .    1",

    "only alphabetic characters are retained .",
    "so @ , # are dropped but we can generally spot user or hashtag terms from the remaining term stump .",
    "numerical data are dropped including dates , since we will focus exclusively on word - based data .",
    "punctuation and special characters go too , e.g.  in urls .",
    "we could handle these were it advisable to do so .    the html expression for ampersand (",
    "`` & amp ; '' ) , in our processing left with a rump , `` amp '' , is substituted with `` and '' .",
    "all upper case is set to lower case ( with no loss of information involved ) .",
    "we deleted `` ll '' ( left over from e.g.  `` i ll '' ) , `` s '' ( from e.g. `` it s '' ) , and `` t '' ( from e.g.   `` is nt '' or `` would nt '' ) .",
    "we find 3323 terms used in the original set of 985 tweets .",
    "terms on a stopword list ( `` and '' , `` the '' , etc . ) are deleted and this decreases the 3323 term set to 3056 terms . in @xcite ( section 5.3 ,",
    "`` tool words : between analysis of form and analysis of content '' ) we discuss the case for considering such function words or `` tool words '' in many languages , that are especially important for characterizing style",

    "the greatest frequency of occurrence value is 3 .",
    "typically the frequency of occurrence is 1 .",

    "our thresholds of 5 were such that rarely used terms were pinpointed , and not at the cost of removing too many terms .    the 968 retained ( non - initiating ) tweets , and the 8 initiating tweets , are crossed by 339 terms .",

    "typically we visualize this semantic , factor representation of the data by taking two factors at a time .",
    "planar projections lend themselves to such display . in the analysis discussion to follow , we tidy up these displays , in order to highlight useful and/or important outcomes .",
    "our first analysis shows the principal factor plane of the 8 tweets that initiated the campaigns , where we projected the supplementary rows ( cf .",

    "we see that campaigns 3 , 5 , 8 have initiating tweets that are fairly close to the net overall campaign in these cases . by looking at all tweets , and all terms , it is seen that the campaign initiating tweets , and the overall campaign means , are close to the origin , i.e.the global average .",
    "that just means that they , respectively  initiating tweets , and means  are relatively unexceptional , and express aggregates .",
    "the very low rates of inertia explained by the factors is an aspect which is fairly standard for such analysis of very sparse cross - tabulations , although it does point to the fact that we are seeing in figure [ fig1 ] just a projection of our data .",
    "therefore , while tweets initiating campaigns 3 , 5 , 8 are the closest to their respective campaign means , this is based on the best fitting planar , two - dimensional dimensions . it is based on the best factor plane , defined by factors 1 and 2 .",

    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] do provide us with a visualization of a particular narrative underlying campaign 7 .",
    "it may be noted that in our earlier work relating to impact of a causal communicative action ( the initiating tweet ) relative to the evolution of the discourse ( the tweets ) , we used the full information space , i.e.  the full dimensionality of the semantic , factor space , in order to draw conclusions .",
    "in the stephen fry twitter case , we saw how we could visualize the critical tweets as a culmination of some relatively homogeneous preceding tweets , and with the following two tweets being semantically very different .",

    "these can be determined in such a way as to be statistically significant .",
    "we discussed the overall flow of the narrative in a way that was between the extremes ( of course , to be checked for in the context of the given data ) of being innocuous versus being exceptional .",
    "we took being innocuous as having a close - to - average semantic profile , in terms of projection in the factorial , latent semantic space .    in the environmental citizenship experimental case study",
    ", we developed a new approach to assessing impact , based on the process of discourse .",
    "a causal element is used , and this is compared to the overall aggregate of a selected part ( since that will be meanginful ) of the course of the discourse .",
    "we studied this comparatively , using 8 different `` campaigns '' .",
    "we traced out the semantic path from initiating tweet to the mean tweet of the associated campaign .",
    "we noted the differences between campaigns .",
    "we did this using the most salient ",
    "the most important  two - dimensional latent semantic , or factor , subspace , in order to illustrate our approach , as well as in the full dimensionality space , using all information and avoiding any approximation .",
    "we noted differences , e.g.  campaign 3 overall was closest to its initiating tweet in the two - factor projection ; but with all information in use , campaign 7 was the most effective campaign of all , in the sense of the initiating tweet being closest to the overall semantic mean of that campaign .",
    "we have also developed a statistical test of significance of impact .",
    "planar projections in our semantic , factor space allow visualization of outcomes .",
    "we looked in detail at campaign 7 , pointing to what were the most influential tweets , and the most revealing terms associated with the underlying ( latent semantic ) components . in some cases , this indicated who ( the tweeter , @ ) or what themes ( hashtag , # ) were dominant , and in other cases particular words were at issue .",
    "our word sets used were carefully selected .",
    "nonetheless they were flexibly open to various grammatical forms , and to stumps of words serving as proxies for words containing punctuation , web addresses , or other non - standard character strings .",
    "we avoided punctuation ( including multiple explanation marks ) and special characters ; we treated words that were run together as a composite word ( possibly to be removed in our preprocessing as a rare word ) ; we avoided numeric data as being non - interpretable for the type of narrative that is of interest to us here ; and we allowed urls or abbreviations to be retained in our analysis as stumps of words ( again possibly removed due to rarity ) .    in our second case study , we noted how top - down , command or managerially imposed approaches to behaviour change have been found to be often inadequate and ineffective .",
    "our motivation was to accept a habermasian view that democratic , inclusive engagement through communicative processes is a better way to bring about behaviour change .",
