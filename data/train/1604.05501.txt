    "the oh molecule was discovered using the @xmath4 doublet transition observed between the levels of the ground rotational state @xmath5 j = 3/2 at 18 cm @xcite ; later its electronic transitions were identified in ultraviolet spectra of bright ob - stars @xcite .",
    "two lines of the a@xmath6x@xmath7 band near 3078 and 3082 @xmath0 are available to ground - based observatories and in a series of papers @xcite estimates of oh column densities along 17 translucent lines of sight from these transitions have been derived .",
    "these observations performed using the high - resolution vlt / uves - spectrograph verified the oscillator strengths for the 3078 and 3082@xmath0 and also suggested a close correlation between the column densities of oh and ch molecules .",
    "early chemical models have suggested production of hydrides like oh and nh due to grain catalysis reactions @xcite .",
    "hence observation of oh to derive abundances towards translucent sightlines with larger than normal far - uv extinction is interesting .",
    "interstellar ch is often observed using its strongest a  x transition at 4300@xmath0 .",
    "however this line being saturated , reliable estimates of ch column densities are derived from the spectral lines due to the weaker b  x system at 3886@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there exist many studies of ch to explore its correlation to the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) at 5780 and 5797@xmath0 @xcite",
    ". however availability of data for oh is significantly worse .",
    "observations have shown the abundances of ch molecule to be tightly correlated with those of the h@xmath2 molecule @xcite .",
    "the correlation is sufficiently strong so that in many recent studies column densities of ch have been used to derive estimates for h@xmath2 column density @xcite .",
    "the correlation is understood in terms of higher formation rates of ch in reactions involving molecular hydrogen .",
    "the aim of this work is to incorporate the newly available oh and ch data for 13 lines of sight ( 5 of which are new ) in order to investigate the correlation between oh and ch in diffuse / translucent molecular clouds .",
    "this correlation is particularly interesting considering the tight correlation between ch and h@xmath2 .",
    "we shall show that the oscillator strengths for the c  x system of lines of ch at 3137@xmath0 are correct so that these can be equivalently used to determine the column densities of ch .",
    "we shall use simple chemical models to check whether the observed correlation between oh and ch or the absence of it is predicted by the chemical models .",
    "we extend the analysed sample of @xcite by combining it with sample of the highly reddened early - type stars which were analyzed by @xcite . in order to complete the information on all the lines of sight as much as possible , we have also analyzed fully processed uves / vlt data of both pairs of ch lines , obtained from the eso science archive facility .",
    "@xcite had identified 30 known features ( 11 atomic and 19 molecular ) and tentatively detected up to 7 new interstellar absorption lines of unknown origin towards 346 targets . out of this entire sample only for 13 sources observations of both the 3078 and 3082@xmath0 transitions of oh were available . out of these 13 sources 8 were already present in the sample used by @xcite .",
    "the observed data for the two ch transitions b@xmath8x@xmath7 at 3886 and 3890@xmath0 for 19 of these sightlines were also presented by @xcite .",

    "the equivalence of the ch column densities derived from a combination of transitions at 3137 and 3143@xmath0 and a combination of transitions at 3886 and 3890@xmath0 has enabled us to combine types of ch datasets .",
