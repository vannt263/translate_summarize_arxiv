    "to increase the energy in higher excited states , the competition of these energies contributes the complicated behavior shown in fig.[excite](b ) .      to investigate the crossover from two - site to single - site bipolarons in quantum information science",

    "so the entire charge of the electrons and entire deformations of the lattices are restricted on one site , leading to the formation of a single - site bipolaron . however , the two - site bipolaron is known as that each electron just interacts with phonons of its own site and then the linear entropy is expected to be much smaller than that of the singlet - site bipolaron . as shown in fig.[entangl1 ] the linear entropy reaches its maximum @xmath112 in the strong coupling region , which displays that the single - site bipolarons are maximally entangled . obviously the crossover point shifts to a large value of the coupling strength @xmath75 as @xmath13 increases .",
