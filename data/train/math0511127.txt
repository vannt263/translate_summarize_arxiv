    "wiener - hopf plus hankel operators ( as well as their discrete analogues based on toeplitz and hankel operators ) are well known to play an important role in several applied areas .",
    "e.g. , this is the case in certain wave diffraction problems , digital signal processing , discrete inverse scattering , and linear prediction . for concrete examples of a detailed enrollment of those operators in these ( and others ) applications we refer to @xcite .    in view of the needs of the applications ,",
    "it is natural to expect a corresponding higher interest in mathematical fundamental research for those kind of operators .",
    "in fact , in recent years several authors have contributed to the mathematical understanding of wiener - hopf plus hankel ( and their discrete analogues ) under different types of assumptions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we recall that the name  wiener - hopf operators \" is due to the initial work of norbert wiener and eberhard hopf @xcite where a reasoning to solve integral equations whose kernels depend only on the difference of the arguments was provided : @xmath0 i.e.  the so - called _ integral wiener - hopf equations_. here @xmath1 @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fixed , @xmath6 is given and @xmath7 is the unknown element .    from those wiener - hopf equations arise the _ ( classical ) wiener - hopf operators _ defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 belongs to the _ wiener algebra _ : @xmath10 ( which is a banach algebra when endowed with the norm @xmath11 and the usual multiplication operation ) . having in mind the convolution operation ,",
    "the definition of @xmath12 in ( [ wh : op ] ) gives rise to an understanding of the wiener - hopf operators as convolution type operators .",
    "therefore , they can also be represented as @xmath13 here @xmath14 denotes the subspace of @xmath15 formed by all the functions supported in the closure of @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the _ restriction operator _ from @xmath15 into @xmath18 , and @xmath19 denotes the _",
    "fourier transformation_. the wiener - hopf operators on @xmath14 may also be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ zero extension operator _ , @xmath22 is the _",
    "canonical projection _ of @xmath15 onto @xmath14 , and @xmath23 is the translation invariant operator @xmath24 . looking now to the structure of the operators in ( [ wh : geral ] ) and ( [ w1 ] ) , we recognize that possibilities other than only the wiener algebra can be considered for the so - called _ fourier symbols _ @xmath9 of the wiener - hopf operators .",
    "namely , we may consider to choose @xmath9 among the @xmath25 elements ( i.e. , as a measurable essentially bounded function in the real line ) .    within the context of",
    "( [ wh : eq ] ) and ( [ wh : op ] ) , the _ hankel integral operators _ have the form @xmath26 ( for some @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is well known that @xmath27 , as an operator defined between @xmath28 spaces , is a compact operator .",
    "however , as seen above , it is also possible to provide a rigorous meaning to the expression ( [ h : op ] ) when the kernel @xmath5 is a temperate distribution whose fourier transform belongs to @xmath25 .",
    "we would like to mention that the discrete analogue of @xmath27 has its roots in the year of 1861 with the ph.d .",
    "thesis of hermann hankel  @xcite . there",
    "the study of finite matrices with entries depending only on the sum of the coordinates was proposed .",
    "determinants of infinite complex matrices with entries defined by @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 , and where @xmath31 is a sequence of complex numbers ) were also studied . for these ( infinite ) hankel matrices , one of the first main results was obtained by kronecker in 1881 @xcite when characterizing the hankel matrices of finite rank as the ones that have corresponding power series , @xmath32 , which are rational functions . in 1906 , hilbert proved that the operator ( induced by the famous hilbert matrix ) , @xmath33 , is bounded on @xmath34 .",
    "this result may be viewed as the origin of ( discrete ) hankel operators , as natural objects arising from hankel matrices .",
    "later on , in 1957 , nehari presented a characterization of bounded hankel operators on @xmath34 @xcite . due to the importance of such characterization",
    ", we may say that it marks the beginning of the contemporary period of the study of hankel operators .    as for combinations between wiener - hopf ( or toeplitz ) and",
    "hankel operators , an important initial step occurred in 1979 when power @xcite used the @xmath35algebra generated by toeplitz and hankel operators .",
    "in particular , power devoted a particular attention to those kinds of operators having piecewise continuous fourier symbols . later on , several other authors considered also interactions between wiener - hopf and hankel operators , as well as the algebra generated by them ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the theory of wiener - hopf plus hankel operators is nowadays well developed for some classes of fourier symbols ( like in the case of continuous or piecewise continuous symbols ) .",
    "in particular , the invertibility and fredholm properties of such kind of operators with piecewise continuous fourier symbols are now well known ( and of great importance for the applications @xcite ) . however , this is not the case for almost periodic fourier symbols which are also important in the applications in view of their appearance due to , e.g. , ( i )  particular finite boundaries in the geometry of physical problems @xcite , or ( ii )  the needs of compositions with shift operators which introduce almost periodic elements in the fourier symbols of those operators @xcite .",
    "the present paper introduces characterizations of the invertibility and fredholm properties of wiener - hopf plus hankel operators with almost periodic fourier symbols .",
    "the main objects of the present work are the wiener - hopf plus hankel operators with fourier symbols in the algebra of almost periodic functions , and acting between @xmath28 lebesgue spaces . in a detailed way",
    ", we will consider operators with the form @xmath36 with @xmath12 and @xmath37 being _ wiener - hopf _ and _ hankel operators _ defined by @xmath38 respectively . here and in",
    "what follows , @xmath39 is the _ reflection operator _ given by the rule @xmath40 . according to , and , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the _ identity operator _ in @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the _ even extension operator _ ,",
    "we may write the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator as @xmath45 finally , the fourier symbol @xmath9 belongs to the algebra @xmath46 of _ almost periodic functions _ , i.e. , the smallest closed subalgebra of @xmath47 that contains all the functions @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50",
    ".    we will proceed now with some basic definitions which will be needed in what follows .",
    "let @xmath51 be a bounded linear operator acting between banach spaces .",
    "the operator @xmath52 is said to be _ normally solvable _ if @xmath53 is closed . in this case , the _ cokernel of t _ is defined as @xmath54 . for a normally solvable operator @xmath52 , the _ deficiency numbers _ of @xmath52 are given by @xmath55 if at least one of the deficiency numbers is finite , the operator @xmath52 is said to be a _ semi - fredholm _ operator .",
    "a normally solvable operator @xmath52 is said to be : ( i ) a _ fredholm _ operator if both @xmath56 and @xmath57 are finite ; ( ii ) _ left - fredholm _ if @xmath56 is finite ; ( iii ) _ right fredholm _ if @xmath57 is finite . in the case when only one of the deficiency numbers is finite , the operator @xmath52 is said to be a _",
    "properly semi - fredholm _ operator . in a more detailed way",
    ", a normally solvable operator @xmath52 is said to be _ properly left - fredholm _",
    "if @xmath56 is finite and @xmath57 is infinite , and _ properly right - fredholm _ if @xmath57 is finite and @xmath56 is infinite .",
    "we point out that in german and russian literature , fredholm operators are often called ( semi-)_noether operators_. this is due to the pioneering work @xcite of fritz noether who was the first to discover that singular integral operators with nonvanishing continuous symbols are normally solvable , and have finite kernel and cokernel dimensions . once again , in german and russian literature ( and related with the notation used in ( [ kercoker ] ) ) , right - fredholm operators and left fredholm operators are frequently called _ @xmath58-normal operators _ and _ @xmath59-normal operators _ , respectively ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let us choose the notation @xmath60 for the group of all invertible elements of a banach algebra @xmath61",
    ". by bohr s theorem , for each @xmath62 there exists a real number @xmath63 and a function @xmath64 such that @xmath65 since @xmath63 is uniquely determined , @xmath63 is usually called the _ mean motion _ of @xmath9 .    for wiener - hopf operators with fourier symbols in @xmath66 , there is a famous semi - fredholm and invertibility criterion due to gohberg - feldman / coburn - douglas based on the sign of the mean motion of the fourier symbol of the operator ( cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite or ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2.28 ) ) :    * if the mean motion of the fourier symbol is negative , then the wiener - hopf operator is properly right - fredholm and right - invertible ; * if the mean motion of the symbol is positive , then the wiener - hopf operator is properly left - fredholm and left - invertible ; * if the mean motion of the symbol is zero , then the wiener - hopf operator is invertible .",
    "this criterion was one of the initial motivations for the present work .",
    "accordingly , the main purpose of this paper is to establish an invertibility and fredholm criterion for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators with almost periodic fourier symbols . to reach such criterion , we need to introduce a new factorization concept for @xmath46 functions  the so - called @xmath46 asymmetric factorization . as we will see in section  [ sect4 ] ( definition  [ def4.1 ] ) , a function @xmath62 is said to admit an @xmath46 asymmetric factorization if it can be represented in the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "( [ ap- ] ) ) , and @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , assuming that @xmath62 admits an @xmath46 asymmetric factorization , the obtained invertibility and fredholm criterion for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators @xmath72 ( cf .",
    "theorem  [ th1 ] ) has a similar structure as the theorem of gohberg - feldman / coburn - douglas mentioned before , and states the following :    * if @xmath73 , then the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator is properly right - fredholm and right - invertible ; * if @xmath74 , then the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator is properly left - fredholm and left - invertible ; * if @xmath75 , then the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator is invertible .    under such conditions",
    ", we can do even better : we can provide a formula for the one - sided and two - sided inverses of the wiener - hopf plus hankel operators by using the factors of the @xmath46 asymmetric factorization .",
    "this result is stated in the last section , in theorem  [ th3 ] , and exhibits the importance of having convenient factorizations for the fourier symbols of the corresponding operators .",
    "we will also present a result on the invertibility dependencies between wiener - hopf and wiener - hopf plus hankel operators with the same @xmath46 fourier symbol ( cf .",
    "corollary  [ cor5.3 ] ) . at a first glance",
    ", this may appear to be a very surprising result .",
    "noticing however that ( in this case ) we will be dealing with a particular kind of factorization , it is more natural to hope to achieve the invertibility of wiener - hopf plus hankel operators from the invertibility of wiener - hopf operators ( by using certain relations between different @xmath46 factorizations ) .    before arriving at the main section  [ sect5 ] ( where the last briefly described results will appear in detail ) , we will recall in section  [ sect2 ] several useful details about almost periodic functions , operator identities for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators are exhibited in section  [ sect3 ] ( allowing therefore the understanding of certain compositions of those kind of operators ) , and factorization concepts are proposed and analyzed in section  [ sect4 ] .",
    "the theory of almost periodic functions ( _ @xmath46 functions _ ) was created by harald bohr between 1923 and 1925 . since then , many contributions to the development of the theory of @xmath46 functions were made ( namely by v.  v.  stepanov , h.  wyel , a.  s.  besicovitch , s.  bochner , j. von neumann , c.  corduneanu , and others ) .",
    "the importance of @xmath46 functions in problems of differential equations , stability theory and dynamical systems potentiated the development of the theory of these functions .    for defining @xmath46 functions , bohr used the concepts of _ relative density _ and _ translation number _",
    "a set @xmath76 is said to be _ relatively dense _ if there exists a number @xmath77 such that any interval of length @xmath78 contains at least one number of @xmath79 .",
    "in addition ( considering @xmath9 being a real or complex function defined on the real line ) , a number @xmath80 is called a _ translation number _ of @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath81 , if @xmath82 for all @xmath83 .",
    "these two last concepts provide the conditions to present the alternative definition of @xmath46 function : a continuous function @xmath9 defined on the real line is called _ almost periodic _ if for every @xmath81 there exists a relatively dense set of translation numbers of @xmath9 corresponding to @xmath84 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath9 is called an @xmath46 function if for every @xmath81 there exists a number @xmath77 such that any interval of length @xmath78 contains at least one number @xmath80 for which @xmath85 for all @xmath83 .    like the periodic functions , @xmath46 functions",
    "can also be represented by fourier series . to obtain such representation",
    ", we have to consider the mean value of an @xmath46 function . by the _",
    "mean value theorem _ , it follows that for every @xmath86 there exists the _",
    "bohr mean value _",
    "( or the _ mean value _ ) of @xmath9 : @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 , the function @xmath90 , being the product of two ap functions , is also an @xmath46 function ( recall that @xmath49 , @xmath91 )",
    ". therefore , there exits the mean value of @xmath90 .",
    "the set @xmath92 is at most countable , and is called the _ bohr - fourier spectrum _ of @xmath9 .",
    "the fourier series associated with the function @xmath9 is given by @xmath93 and we may write @xmath94 where @xmath95 . the elements @xmath96 of the bohr - fourier spectrum are called the _ fourier exponents _ , and the corresponding mean values @xmath97 are called the _ fourier coefficients_.    in @xcite , we find the _",
    "fundamental theorem _ of the theory of @xmath46 functions .",
    "the fundamental theorem states that the class of almost periodic functions is identical with the closure of the class of all _ trigonometric polynomials _ : @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 . to reach to the fundamental theorem",
    ", bohr proved that the limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of @xmath46 functions is also an almost periodic function .",
    "thus , being trigonometric polynomials almost periodic functions , it follows that the limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of trigonometric polynomials is an @xmath46 function .",
    "this means that every function belonging to the closure of the class of all finite sums ( [ trigpol ] ) is in the class of almost periodic functions .",
    "the converse also holds .",
    "that is , every @xmath46 function is the limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of trigonometric polynomials .",
    "this result is called the _ approximation theorem_. more precisely , the approximation theorem asserts that given @xmath86 , for each @xmath81 , there exists a trigonometric polynomial @xmath101 , whose exponents are the fourier exponents of @xmath9 , and such that @xmath102 for all @xmath83 .     for @xmath103 in @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]   for @xmath103 in @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]     for @xmath103 in @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ] for @xmath103 in @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    from the approximation theorem , we obtain a characterization of almost periodic functions which is sometimes presented as the definition of almost periodic functions .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite where @xmath46 functions are those complex - valued functions defined on the real line which can be uniformly approximated by trigonometric polynomials , and @xcite where the algebra of the @xmath46 functions is defined as the smallest closed subalgebra of @xmath47 that contains all the functions @xmath106 .    to illustrate the notion of @xmath46 function , figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] exhibit the images of two particular @xmath46 functions @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    from bohr s theorem ( cf .  also ( [ meanm ] ) ) , it is possible to observe that the argument of an invertible @xmath46 function is given by the sum of a linear function and an @xmath46 function . for @xmath109 ,",
    "the mean motion of @xmath9 can be obtained by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is any continuous argument of @xmath9 .",
    "considering that every function in @xmath46 may be represented by a series , but not every function in @xmath46 may be represented by an absolutely convergent series , it is also useful to consider the subclass @xmath112 of all functions @xmath113 which can be written in the form of an absolutely convergent series : latexmath:[\\[\\varphi(x)=\\sum_j \\varphi_j e^{i\\lambda_jx}\\quad ( x\\in \\mathbb{r}),\\qquad \\lambda_j \\in \\mathbb{r},\\qquad \\sum_j     to end this section about @xmath46 functions , we present the definitions of other special subsets of @xmath46 that will have a preponderant use in the proposed factorizations of @xmath46 functions in below .",

    "the study of relations between different classes of operators is an important subject in operator theory since ( in particular ) it allows the transfer of properties from one class of operators to other ones .",
    "an example of these kind of relations is the _ equivalence _ between operators : considering two bounded linear operators acting between banach spaces , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the operators @xmath52 and @xmath124 are said to be _ equivalent _ @xcite if there are two boundedly invertible linear operators , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 another important example of relation between operators is the _ equivalence after extension _ relation ( or _ matricial coupling _ ) , which is a generalization of the equivalence relation between operators . in @xcite ,",
    "bart and tsekanovskii proved that two operators acting between banach spaces are equivalent after extension if and only if they are matricially coupled .",
    "it follows from that if two operators are equivalent , then they belong to the same _ regularity class _ @xcite . in particular ,",
    "this implies that one of these operators is invertible , one - sided invertible , fredholm , properly left - fredholm , properly right fredholm or normally solvable , if and only if the other operator enjoys the same property .",
    "in our case we are interested in obtaining relations between wiener - hopf plus hankel operators and wiener - hopf operators , and this idea will be used ahead in the process of obtaining an invertibility criterion for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators .",
    "therefore , in order to reach such relation , we will start by identifying certain operator identities for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators and wiener - hopf operators .    from the wiener - hopf and hankel operator theory ,",
    "the following relations are well known : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the zero extension operator .",
    "additionally , from the last two identities , it follows that @xmath130 and @xmath131    let @xmath132 denote the set of all bounded and analytic functions in @xmath133 , and let @xmath134 be the set of all functions in @xmath25 that are non - tangential limits of elements in @xmath135 we will also use @xmath136 , which is defined in the obvious corresponding way . due to ,",
    "if we consider @xmath137 or @xmath138 being an even function , then we obtain a multiplicative relation @xmath139    note that if the fourier symbol of a wiener - hopf operator admits a factorization of the form @xmath140 , where @xmath141 and @xmath142 , it is possible to apply to the wiener - hopf operator the multiplicative property @xmath143 ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 2.17 ) ) . with a convenient change , it is possible to construct for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators a corresponding result as the one known for wiener - hopf operators . in the present case",
    "we may apply the multiplicative property on the left if the left factor belongs to @xmath134 and on the right if the right factor is an even function , like the following proposition asserts .",
    "[ prop2 ] let @xmath144 .",
    "if @xmath145 and @xmath146 , then the following operator factorization takes place : @xmath147    from the hypothesis @xmath148 , we may apply the already presented multiplicative relation for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators , see .",
    "thus @xmath149 in addition , since @xmath146 , it also follows from that @xmath150 from and , we have that @xmath151 since @xmath148 , we have @xmath152 due to the structure of the hankel operators .",
    "therefore @xmath153 and it follows from that @xmath154 .    from ( [ eq6 ] )",
    "we have that if the symbol of the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator is factorized in such a way that the right factor is an even function , this leads to a factorization of the wiener - hopf plus hankel operator , where a wiener hopf plus hankel operator with an even symbol appears .",
    "due to the multiplicative relation for wiener - hopf plus hankel operators ( see ( [ eq6 ] ) ) , we conclude that the wiener hopf plus hankel operator with an even symbol is an invertible operator .",

    "rewriting @xmath174 and @xmath175 by using the factors of the right @xmath46 factorization , @xmath243 and @xmath244 , we have @xmath245    [ cor1 ] let @xmath62 . if @xmath9 admits a canonical right @xmath46 factorization , @xmath246 then @xmath9 admits a canonical @xmath46 asymmetric factorization , @xmath247 with @xmath229 , and @xmath230 .",

    ", it holds that @xmath250 and hence @xmath251 due to proposition  [ prop2 ] and also taking into account that , because @xmath250 , @xmath252 . since @xmath253 , by the characterization of @xmath195 , there exists a @xmath196 such that @xmath254 .",

    "after having reached an invertibility criterion for the wiener - hopf plus hankel operators , we start looking for an explicit formula for the reflexive generalized inverses of these wiener - hopf plus hankel operators .",
    "the obtained formula is expressed in terms of the factors of the @xmath46 asymmetric factorization . from the value of @xmath216 of the middle factor of the @xmath46 asymmetric factorization , @xmath117 , it is possible to distinguish that the reflexive generalized inverse is in fact a right - inverse , left - inverse or inverse .",
    "i.e. , depending on @xmath73 , @xmath266 and @xmath75 , we obtain the right - inverse , the left - inverse and the inverse of @xmath267 , respectively .",
    "as we will see in the theorem below , the explicit formula for the reflexive generalized inverse of @xmath267 is given in terms of an arbitrary extension operator @xmath268 .",
