    "a great deal of work has recently gone into studying the possibility that the universe may possess compact spatial sections with a nontrivial topology , including the construction of different topological indicators ( see , for example , refs .",

    "@xcite and weeks  @xcite have discussed the detectability of cosmic topology of nearly flat hyperbolic universes . an important outcome from these studies  @xcite  ",
    "@xcite is that by using any method of detection of topology which rely on observations of repeated patterns the topology of an increasing number of nearly flat ( hyperbolic and spherical ) becomes undetectable as @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it would appear at first sight that in the limiting case @xmath6 the topology of flrw universes would definitely be undetectable .",
    "however , it is well known that when @xmath1 is exactly one the topological possibilities for the universe are completely different , and the detectability of cosmic topology may again become possible . in this article",

    "we remark from the outset that our use of an _ ad hoc _ hypothesis , such as that of bernshten and shvartsman s , is just for illustrative purposes , and we are not suggesting that this particular hypothesis is a realistic assumption for establishing a relation between topological typical lengths and the dynamics of flat models . as a particular result",

    "the details of the isometric classification of compact flat @xmath0-dimensional manifolds is treated in appendix  a. finally in appendix  b we present the relevant piece of calculations which lead to the expressions of the volume of all compact euclidean @xmath0-manifolds .",
    "we shall assume in this work that the universe is modelled by a @xmath8-manifold @xmath9 which allows a @xmath10 splitting , @xmath11 , endowed with robertson - walker metric with locally flat spatial sections [ flrw1 ] ds^2 = -c^2dt^2 + r^2 ( t ) , where @xmath12 is a cosmic time , @xmath13 is the speed of light , and @xmath14 is the scale factor .",
    "furthermore , we shall also assume that the @xmath0-space @xmath15 is a compact flat manifold , i.e. @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a discrete group of euclidean isometries acting freely on @xmath18 .",
    "the group @xmath17 is the so - called the covering group of @xmath15 , and is isomorphic to the fundamental group @xmath19 .    for non - flat models ( @xmath20 ) ,",

    ", @xmath21 can still be interpreted as the distance of any point with coordinates @xmath23 to the origin of coordinates in units of @xmath14 , but since the curvature radius of euclidean @xmath0-space is infinite , one can not identify @xmath14 with the curvature radius , and so in this case there is no natural unit of length . thus in this work , differently from refs .",
    "@xcite , we will use megaparsecs ( @xmath24)as unit of length .    in the light of current observations ,",
    "we assume the current matter content of the universe to be well approximated by pressureless dust plus a cosmological constant  @xcite .",

    "finally we note that the horizon radius @xmath29 is defined as the limit of ( [ redshift - dist ] ) when @xmath30 .    to close this section we remark that it is unlikely that astro - cosmological observations can fix the density parameter @xmath1 to be exactly equal to one .",
    "however , since the algebraic structure of the fundamental group of a constant curvature manifold is different for each constant curvature @xmath0-geometry , the identification of the topology of space would unambiguously fix the sign of the @xmath0-curvature .",
    "moreover , if it turns out that @xmath1 is exactly equal to one , topology seems to be the only way to precisely determine such a sharp value for @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the classification of all flat compact @xmath0-manifolds ( treated in full details in appedix  a ) and derive the explicit expressions for the corresponding injectivity radii @xmath31 .",
    "further , we also present the formulae for the volumes of these @xmath0-manifolds , which are obtained with some details in appendix  b. the expressions for the injectivity radii are needed to build the topological indicator @xmath2 ( section  [ dettop ] ) , which together with the expressions for the volumes are employed in section  [ toys ] to concretely discuss the detectability of the topology of classes of compact flat cosmological models .",
    "the diffeomorphic classification of euclidean @xmath0-dimensional space forms is well known  @xcite .",

    "for example , a @xmath0-torus can be constructed by taking any parallelepiped and identifying opposite faces by translations .",
    "note that parallelepipeds with different volumes give rise to non - isometric torii . also stretching the parallelepiped in one or more directions",
    "while leaving the volume constant also gives rise to non - isometric torii .",
    "more exactly , the generators of the covering group of a torus form a basis in euclidean @xmath0-space .",
    "since the only condition for three vectors in euclidean @xmath0-space to form a basis is to be linearly independent , no restriction is imposed on the lengths of these vectors , nor on their mutual orientations , i.e. the angles between them .",
    "these six parameters ( three lengths and three angles ) uniquely characterize a torus  locally \" in the @xmath78-dimensional parameter space formed by the lengths of the basis vectors and the angles between them .",
    "so , two torii with these six parameters approximately equal are non - isometric , but very similar in shape and size",
    ". however , this characterization is not unique .",
    "this can be seen by considering any basis @xmath32 , and using it to construct another basis , say @xmath79 , that generates the same fundamental group , and hence the same torus .",
    "clearly the lengths of the vectors and the angles between them are very different for these two bases .",
    "thus we have two different sets of these six parameters characterizing the same torus .",
    "it is therefore clear that , to uniquely characterize isometrically a torus , one has to perform some identifications in the @xmath78-dimensional parameter space formed by the lengths of the basis vectors and the angles between them .",
    "this resulting quotient space is a kind of modular space for the torus , and uniquely gives the isometric classification for it . the isometric classification , i.e. the modular spaces , of euclidean @xmath0-dimensional compact space forms is given with some details in appendix  a , where we rectify some points of wolf s classification  @xcite .",
    "a natural way to characterize the shape of compact manifolds is through the size of their closed geodesics .",
    "a suitable indicator is constructed using the injectivity radius defined by ( see  @xcite ) [ rinj ] r_inj = _ ( g , x ) p \\{_g(x ) } , where @xmath80 denotes the covering group without the identity map , i.e. @xmath81 , and @xmath82 is any fundamental polyhedron for @xmath15 .",

    "g(x ) = d(x , gx ) , for all @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the euclidean metric .",
    "the distance function gives the length of the closed geodesic associated with the isometry @xmath87 that passes through the projection of @xmath37 onto @xmath15 .",
    "so , from  ( [ rinj ] ) and  ( [ dist - function ] ) one has that the injectivity radius is half of the length of the smallest closed geodesic in @xmath15 , or equivalently , the radius of the smallest sphere inscribable in @xmath15 . '' .",
    "it was defined by saying that `` at distances @xmath88 there is nt a single ghost '' . in modern terms",
    "it means that any survey with depth smaller than the injectivity radius does not present multiple images nor pattern repetitions ( see section  [ dettop ] ) .",
    "] in a globally homogeneous manifold , the distance function for any covering isometry @xmath89 is constant , and so is the length of the closed geodesic associated to @xmath89 and that passes through any @xmath90 .",
    "however , this is not the case in a locally , but not globally , homogeneous manifold , so the calculation of @xmath31 for these cases requires some careful work .    to compute @xmath31",
    "it is convenient to choose a faithful representation of @xmath15 .",
    "we take the dirichlet domain @xmath82 of @xmath17 centered at the origin of euclidean @xmath0-space .",
    "consider the subset @xmath91 consisting on the isometries that transform @xmath82 to a neighbouring cell in the correspondent tessellation .",
    "thus for all @xmath92 , @xmath93 is either a face , an edge , or a vertex of @xmath82 .",
    "now , for any @xmath94 , the set of points that @xmath35 leaves unchanged ( the axis of rotation if @xmath95 , or the plane of reflection if @xmath96 ) passes through the origin and thus intersects @xmath82 , so [ mindelta ] _ x p \\{_g(x ) } = |a_g^| , where @xmath97 is the projection of @xmath98 onto the set of fixed points of @xmath35 . from eqs .",
    "( [ rinj ] ) and  ( [ mindelta ] ) and taking into account the above reasoning we have @xmath99    analyzing separately each case from tables  [ tb : oesf ] and  [ tb : noesf ] one can compute the injectivity radius for any compact euclidean @xmath0-dimensional space form .",
    "the results are exhibited in the third column of each table .",
    "let us illustrate this procedure for the case of manifolds of class @xmath56 .",
    "firstly note that the matrices @xmath45 , @xmath57 and @xmath61 satisfy the products @xmath100 , where the indices @xmath101 run in a cyclic order .",
    "secondly note that the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath41 , and @xmath13 , are parallel to the axes of rotation of @xmath45 , @xmath57 and @xmath61 respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "any isometry of the covering group of a manifold of class @xmath56 is of the form @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 is a linear combination of the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath41 , and @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath105 has no fixed points , then the coefficient of @xmath34 is a non - zero integer if @xmath106 , and similarly for other values of @xmath107 .",
    "it is now clear that @xmath108 is a multiple of @xmath34 , @xmath41 , or @xmath13 for @xmath109 or 3 respectively .",
    "thus the minimum length of a closed geodesic in a @xmath56 manifold is @xmath110 .    to conclude this section note that the volumes of all closed euclidean @xmath0-manifolds are listed in the fourth column of tables  [ tb : oesf ] and  [ tb : noesf ] .",
    "the relevant calculations are given in appendix  b.",
    "regardless of our present - day inability to predict the topology of the universe , its detection and determination is ultimately expected to be an observational problem . at present",
    "it is becoming clear that the detection of a possible nontrivial topology of the universe may be a difficult problem to accomplish in view of the bounds on the cosmological parameters set by recent observations  @xcite  ",
    "indeed , it was shown in  @xcite ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for detectability of spherical spaces , and also  @xciteand  @xcite for the hyperbolic manifolds ) that , if one uses pattern repetitions , increasing number of nearly flat spherical and hyperbolic possible topologies for the universe become undetectable as @xmath5 .",
    "it would appear at first sight that in the limiting case @xmath6 the topology of such universes would definitely be undetectable .",
    "it turns out , however , that when @xmath1 is exactly one the topological possibilities for the universe are completely different , and the detectability of cosmic topology may again become possible . in this section",
    "we shall briefly review our approach to the detectability of cosmic topology in order to study explicitly in section  [ toys ] the detectability of the topology of flat universes .    for cosmological models with compact spatial sections @xmath15",
    "which have nontrivial topology it is clear that any attempt at the discovery of such a topology through observations must start with the comparison between the horizon radius and suitable characteristic sizes of the manifold @xmath15 .",
    "we use the injectivity radius as a characteristic size of @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio of the injectivity radius to the horizon radius , [ t_hor ] t_inj^hor= , is very useful to identify cosmological models whose topology is undetectable through methods that rely on the existence of multiple images or pattern repetitions in any survey .",
    "in fact , for the case in which @xmath111 the whole observable universe lies inside a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath15 , no matter what is the location of the observer in the manifold ( universe ) .",
    "in such cases no multiple images ( or pattern repetitions ) will arise from any survey .",
    "thus , any method for the search of cosmic topology based on the existence of repeated patterns ( multiple images ) will fail  the topology of the universe is _ definitely undetectable _ in such cases .",
    "note that this is nothing but a formal rewording of sokolov and shvartsman s statement quoted in footnote  2 .",
    "we shall now discuss the detectability problem when we restrict the search to specific catalogues .",
    "there are basically three types of catalogues which can possibly be used in order to search for repeated patterns in the universe : namely , clusters of galaxies , containing clusters with redshifts of up to @xmath112 ; active galactic nuclei ( mainly qso s and quasars ) , with a redshift cut - off of @xmath113 ; and maps of the cmbr with a redshift of @xmath114 . in this way ,",
    "instead of @xmath29 it is observationally more suitable to consider the largest distance @xmath115 covered by a given survey , and define the indicator [ t_inj ] t_inj= . in this context",
    ", we shall refer to the region covered by a given survey by  observed universe \" .",
    "now , if for a given catalogue @xmath116 , every source in the survey is inside a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath15 , no matter the location of the observer within the manifold . actually , the whole",
    " observed universe \" lies inside a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath15 .",
    "so , there are no multiple images in that survey any method for the search of cosmic topology based on the existence of repeated patterns will fail  the topology of the universe is _ undetectable _ with this specific survey .",
    "thus , there emerges trivially from eq .",
    "( [ t_inj ] ) and the expressions for the injectivity radii for all classes of flat manifolds given in section  [ flat3man ] the undetectability conditions for each ( topological ) class of flat universes .",
    "equations  ( [ undregion ] ) of section  [ toys ] constitute an example of such conditions for the flat classes @xmath48 and @xmath54 ( see also  @xcite for another explicit example ) .    the bounds provided by recent cosmological observations  @xcite    @xcite can be used to identify flat models having undetectable topologies , since an absolute lower bound of @xmath31 for undetectability of flat universes can be obtained by calculating the horizon radius corresponding to the limiting values of the density parameters .",
    "indeed , for @xmath117 and @xmath118 , one obtains @xmath119 from equation  ( [ redshift - dist ] ) .",
    "thus , flat universes for which @xmath120 have undetectable topologies . ) , the undetectable flat universes are now those for which @xmath121 , making clear that relative lower bounds arise when different catalogues are used . ]",
    "some remarks are in order here .",
    "the indicator @xmath2 is useful for the identification of cosmological models whose topology is undetectable by search methods based on the presumed existence of multiple images , for when @xmath122 , the whole",
    " observed universe \" lies inside a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath15 .",
    "however , it should be noted that without further considerations , nothing can be said when @xmath123 .",
    "in fact in this case , despite the depth of a given survey is larger than @xmath31 , it may be that , due to the location of the observer , the  observed universe \" would still be inside a fundamental polyhedron of @xmath15 making the topology undetectable .",
    "this is the case when the smallest closed geodesic that passes through the observer is larger than @xmath124 .",
    "there is the case when @xmath4 is larger than the length of the smallest closed geodesic that passes through the position of the observer , but not too much larger , so that only a small fraction of the `` observed universe '' contains multiple images .",
    "current methods that look for multiple images are not sensitive enough to detect this small quantity of copies , so even in this case the topology of the universe would be in practice undetectable until suitable refined new methods are developed ( and used ) . these and other points will be dealt with in future works .",
    "the topology of a given cosmological model being undetectable for a given survey up to a depth @xmath125 , clearly may be detectable by using a deeper survey .",
    "however , the deepest catalogue ( survey ) ever constructed will have @xmath126 .",
    "thus the quotient  ( [ t_inj ] ) computed with @xmath127 is a lower bound for the indicator @xmath2 .",
    "it turns out that , in practice , there is almost no difference if we push @xmath127 to infinite , and take @xmath128 as the lower bound for @xmath2 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "since there is no natural unit of length in euclidean geometry , there is no natural way to relate the typical lengths of the spatial sections of a flat cosmological model with the density parameters within the general relativity framework , as in the case of non - flat cosmological models ( see e.g.  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "so one should rely on other kinds of grounds to establish such a connection .",
    "althouigh it is not our purpose here to discuss the origin and motivation of this sort of connection , it is interesting to concretely explore the consequences of one of such a hypothetical interrelation . for this purpose",
    "we will construct some toy models based on a hypothesis first proposed by bernshten and shvartsman  @xcite .",
    "a word of clarification is in order here .",
    "we emphasize that we are not claiming that this is a sound assumption for constructing realistic theoretical models for our universe . instead",
    ", our intention here is to illustrate how a hypothesis like this , that may arrive from , e.g. , a fundamental theory unifying elementary particles with gravity , can be used to construct models which can be in principle confronted with cosmological observations .",
    "thus , following bernshten and shvartsman  @xcite we will suppose that the total number of baryons in our universe equals the reciprocal of the square of the gravitational fine structure constant , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the gravitational constant , here @xmath131 is planck s constant and @xmath132 is the proton mass .",
    "this hypothesis enables one to construct cosmological models in which the volume of the universe is related to cosmological parameters and fundamental physical constants as follows .",
    "since the total baryonic mass is @xmath133 , the volume of our universe is @xmath134 where we have used @xmath135 for the baryon density parameter . taking the current value for @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , one obtains @xmath138 for the volume of the universe .    in order to illustrate the method of analysis of detectability of topology in these models ,",
    "let us restrict to those ones whose spatial sections have a @xmath48 or @xmath54 topology .",
    "note that the expressions for both @xmath31 and the volumes of these two classes are identical , and moreover , the other classes can be dealt with in a similar way .",
    "let us also consider that we are looking for multiple images with a catalogue of clusters of galaxies with redshift cut - off @xmath139 . using the values @xmath140 and @xmath141",
    "( see  @xcite ) for @xmath142 one obtains @xmath143 . from table",
    "[ tb : oesf ] we have that the region of undetectability is given by    this region is shown in figure  1 , together with a curve of constant volume given by  ( [ voluniv2 ] ) .",
    "this figure shows that the region of undetectability does not intersect the curve of constant volume , making clear that it may be possible to detect the topology in such universes .",
    "however , the possibility of detecting and even deciding the topology in these models clearly also depends on other factors such as the location of the observer in @xmath15 , and the quality and reliability of the catalogues and methods used for the search of repeated patterns . we will deal with these problems in forthcoming articles .    #",
    "1#20.5#1    it is interesting to mention that if one introduces a modified version of the bernshten - shvartsman assumption in which @xmath144 equals the reciprocal of the square of a new gravitational fine structure constant now given by _",
    "gr^-2 = ( ) ^-2 9.68 10 ^ 82 , where @xmath145 is the electron mass , following the above reasoning one obtains a figure in which the curve of constant volume lies in the undetectability region , making clear that the topology of such flat universes of classes @xmath48 and @xmath54 is undetectable even if cmbr is used .",
    "we shall not go into details of such a simple ( and rather similar ) calculations here for the sake of brevity .",
    "furthermore , note that the above results are insensitive to substantial variations of the values of the cosmological density parameters @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "in fact , even for the extreme cases of einstein - de sitter ( @xmath146 ) and pure cosmological constant ( @xmath147 ) , the constant volume curve does not cross the undetectability region of figure  1 if the bernshten - shvartsman assumption is used , whereas if the above mentioned modified version of this assumption is employed one arrives at flat universes with undetectable topologies .",
    "alternatively , one can consider models in which the injectivity radius of the universe before inflation was of the order of the planck length .",
    "a simple calculation shows that to the topology be undetectable , inflation should have expanded the universe more than a factor of @xmath148 .",
    "thus the detection of topology would set stringent constraints on inflationary models .",
    "it is becoming generally known that the detection of a possible nontrivial topology of the universe may be a difficult problem to accomplish in view of the bounds on the cosmological parameters set by recent observations which seem to indicate that we live in flrw accelerating universe with nearly flat spatial sections indeed , its has been shown in  @xcite  ",

    "the isometric classification can be collected together in the following theorem :    [ th : isom - fe - e-3 ] the isometric classification of euclidean @xmath0-dimensional compact space forms is as follows :    1 .",
    "the class @xmath149 is parametrized by the equivalence classes @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the matrix whose rows are formed by the vectors of a base of euclidean @xmath0-space that generates the covering group of the torus .",
    "the class @xmath44 is parametrized by the ordered triples @xmath152 , where the pair @xmath153 parametrizes the bidimensional torus generated by the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath13 .",
    "the classes @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 are parametrized by the ordered pairs @xmath157,@xmath158 .",
    "the classes @xmath56 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 are parametrized by the ordered triples @xmath157,@xmath161,@xmath162 .",
    "the classes @xmath163 and @xmath164 are parametrized by the triples @xmath165 , where the pair @xmath153 parametrizes the double covering of the modular space of the bidimensional torus generated by the vectors @xmath34 and @xmath41 , which interchanges the generators of the lattice . additionally , for the class @xmath68",
    ", we have the constraint @xmath166 .",
    "* proof . *",
    "we begin by constructing the modular space for the simplest classes , namely @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath54 .",
    "consider first the class @xmath48 and note that @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 . since @xmath49 is an orthogonal transformation",
    ", it follows that @xmath170 , and from latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\langle b , c \\rangle & = & \\langle bb , bc \\rangle \\\\                                      & = & - \\ , \\langle c , b+c   \\rangle \\\\                                      & = & - \\langle b , c \\rangle -     @xmath41 and @xmath13 is @xmath172 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath34 is orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have then that all the angles between the basis vectors are fixed , and two lengths ( those of @xmath41 and @xmath13 ) are equal , leaving just two free parameters , namely @xmath173 and @xmath161 .",
    "it is now clear that the ordered pair @xmath174 parametrizes isometrically manifolds of class @xmath48 .",
    "manifolds of classes @xmath51 and @xmath54 are analyzed in a similar way , by just looking at the action of the transformations @xmath52 and @xmath55 on the basis vectors , respectively .",
    "one obtains the following :    @xmath51 .",
    ": :    the three basis vectors are mutually orthogonal , and @xmath41    and @xmath13 are of the same length . the ordered pair    @xmath174 parametrizes isometrically this class . @xmath54 . : :    the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath13 are of the same length    and the angle between them is @xmath175 , furthermore    @xmath34 is orthogonal to both @xmath41 and    @xmath13 .",
    "again , the ordered pair @xmath174    parametrizes isometrically this class .",
    "let us now turn our attention to manifolds with @xmath0-dimensional modular spaces , i.e. manifolds of classes @xmath56 , @xmath71 and @xmath74 .",
    "in all these cases the basis vectors are mutually orthogonal , as can be seen by analyzing the action of the transformations @xmath45 , @xmath57 , @xmath61 and @xmath66 on the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , there is no restriction on the lengths of these vectors , so the parameter space is @xmath0-dimensional . in order to see that these classes are parametrized by the ordered triple @xmath176 note that the vector @xmath34 is the only one that enters as a translation along the axis of rotation of a screw motion . also , for the classes @xmath71 and @xmath74 , the vector @xmath41 is in the invariant subspace of the reflection @xmath66 , while @xmath13 is not . on the other hand , for the class @xmath56",
    ", the vector @xmath41 is in the invariant subspace of the rotation in the screw motion @xmath177 , while @xmath13 does not have an analog property . clearly",
    ", the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath13 play distinguished roles as translations in the generators of the corresponding covering groups .",
    "we now briefly review the isometric classification of the bidimensional torus in order to continue with the proof of theorem [ th : isom - fe - e-3 ] .",
    "the generators of the covering group of a 2-torus are two linearly independent vectors in the euclidean plane , say @xmath178 .",
    "these two vectors generate a lattice in the plane , namely @xmath179 actually , the lattice @xmath180 is the orbit of the origin under the action of the group generated by the basis @xmath181 .",
    "it is clear that two different bases give rise to equivalent lattices if they are related by an orthogonal transformation of the plane , so one can always order the generators so that ( i ) @xmath182axis , and ( iii ) @xmath41 is in the upper half plane with non - negative first component .",
    "moreover , the bases @xmath183 and @xmath184 , with @xmath185 being a positive integer , give rise to the same lattice , so @xmath41 can be taken to be such that its projection to the @xmath186axis lies between 0 and @xmath187 .",
    "thus a 2-torus is characterized isometrically by the pair @xmath153 , where @xmath188 , and @xmath189 is the complex number representing the same point in the plane as the vector @xmath190 .",
    "the parameter @xmath189 satisfies the following conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath191 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath192 .",
    "next we study classes with 4-dimensional parameter spaces .",
    "class @xmath44 is the simplest , the vector @xmath34 is orthogonal to @xmath41 and @xmath13 , and there is no restriction to the angle between these two vectors , nor to the lengths of the three basis vectors . thus ordering the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath13 such that @xmath193 one concludes that the modular space of the class @xmath44 is @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the modular space for the bidimensional torus generated by @xmath41 and @xmath13 .",
    "for the class @xmath65 one notes that the vectors @xmath34 and @xmath41 are in the invariant subspace of the reflection @xmath66 , and @xmath13 is orthogonal to it . since there is no restriction to the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath41 , these two vectors form a bidimensional torus .",
    "however , one can not simply set the condition latexmath:[$|a| \\leq     @xmath41 enter in a very different way in generating the covering group of the manifold , i.e. @xmath41 is a pure translation while @xmath34 enters as part of a glide reflection",
    ". hence we use a double covering of the modular space of the 2-torus generated by @xmath34 and @xmath41 to parametrize the class @xmath65 , one sheet parametrizing the case @xmath195 , the other parametrizing the case @xmath196 .",
    "the class @xmath68 is similar to the class @xmath65 , except that @xmath13 is not orthogonal to the plane formed by @xmath34 and @xmath41 , but has a projection @xmath197 on this plane .",
    "this is the origin of the constraint latexmath:[$|c| >      finally let us consider the class @xmath40 , or the @xmath0-dimensional torus .",
    "the isometric classification of the torus has been partially discussed in section  [ flat3man ] .",
    "there , we have seen that bases related by orthogonal transformations give rise to isometric torii , and furthermore , one has to perform additional identifications on the set of bases of @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space to give a unique characterization of isometric torii . to put this in mathematical ( and useful ) language ,",
    "let us first choose as a reference basis the canonical one ( @xmath199 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 ) to write the components of vectors and transformations .",
    "now , let us write a basis in euclidean @xmath0-space as a square matrix whose rows are the components of the vectors of the basis .",
    "if the basis @xmath202 is related to the basis @xmath203 by an orthogonal transformation , one can write @xmath204 where @xmath205 . in this case , the bases @xmath181 and @xmath206 generate two isometric torii .",
    "a lattice in euclidean @xmath0-space is the orbit of the origin by the action of a group generated by three linearly independent vectors .",
    "thus if @xmath207 , the lattice generated by @xmath181 is the set @xmath208 now , two bases @xmath181 and @xmath206 may produce the same lattice , and hence generate the same torus .",
    "in fact , consider the group @xmath209 formed by the square matrices of order three with integer entries and determinant unity .",
    "any two bases related by a matrix @xmath210 generates the same lattice , for if @xmath211 , each @xmath212 is an integer linear combination of @xmath181 , and thus @xmath213 . on the other side , @xmath214 , thus @xmath215 , and",
    "so @xmath216 . we have that two bases @xmath181 and @xmath206 generate the same torus if there exist @xmath217 and @xmath205 such that @xmath218 .",
    "in this appendix we show how to calculate the volumes of compact flat @xmath0-manifolds in terms of their modular spaces .",
    "the calculations are based on the following simple observations :    1 .",
    "the volume of a compact manifold of constant curvature equals the volume of any of its fundamental domains . 2 .",
    "if @xmath17 is the covering group of a compact flat @xmath0-dimensional manifold in the form given in tables [ tb : oesf ] and  [ tb : noesf ] , the orbit of the origin by @xmath17 is a lattice , and a fundamental domain of this lattice is a fundamental domain of @xmath17 .",
    "a fundamental domain of the lattice generated by the base @xmath219 is the parallelepiped naturally constructed with these vectors , and thus its volume is @xmath220 .",
    "now , in terms of the correspondent modular spaces given in theorem  [ th : isom - fe - e-3 ] , the orbit of the origin by the covering group of a manifold of any of the classes @xmath40@xmath221 or @xmath65@xmath222 , is the lattice generated by the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath41 and @xmath13 . while the orbit of the origin by the covering group of a manifold of class @xmath56 is a lattice generated by the vectors @xmath34 , @xmath58 and @xmath223 .",
    "finally , note that a manifold of class @xmath74 is a double covering of the manifold of class @xmath71 with the same parameters , hence its volume doubles that of the corresponding manifold of class @xmath71 .",
