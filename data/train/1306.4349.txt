    "in the ref . [ 1 ] the center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of a kerr black hole studied and proposed that this might lead to signals from ultra high energy collisions such as dark matter physics [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "it yields to universal property of rotating black holes which is infinite cm energy of colliding particles and investigated by several papers [ 4 - 16 ] .",
    "+ now , aim of this paper is studying the particle acceleration mechanism of stu black hole [ 16 - 22 ] . the stu black hole exist in special case of @xmath0 , @xmath1 gauged supergravity theory which is dual to the @xmath2 sym theory with finite chemical potential . in this background , generally there are three electric charges . in this paper",
    "we assume that three of them will be equal and discussed about uncharged black holes .",
    "therefore , first we introduce stu black hole and then try to obtain cm energy of two colliding particles near the stu black hole and then discuss about consequence .",
    "stu black hole is described by the following solution , @xmath3 where , @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the constant ads radius which relates to the coupling constant via @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the radial coordinate along the black hole .",
    "the black hole horizon specified by @xmath8 which is obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "also @xmath10 is called non - extremality parameter .",
    "so , for the extremal limit one can assume @xmath11 .",
    "moreover @xmath12 includes @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the hawking temperature of stu black hole is given by , @xmath15 so , in the case of @xmath16 we get , @xmath17 here it is useful to discuss horizon structure of the metric ( 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 reduced to the following equation , @xmath18 where , @xmath19 and , @xmath20 a possible solutions of the equation ( 5 ) is given by , @xmath21 where , @xmath22 the @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote outer and inner horizons respectively .",
    "in order to obtain the cm energy we consider planar motion which yields @xmath25 .",
    "other 4-velocity of the particles are @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the first two components obtained by using the following relations , @xmath29 and , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote the test particle energy and the angular momentum parallel to the symmetry axis per unit mass respectively . in order to obtain @xmath28 we assume , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is proper time .",
    "then we use , @xmath35 and , @xmath36 therefore , we can summarize , @xmath37 if we take the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath38 , @xmath39 and energy per unit mass @xmath40 , @xmath41 , respectively , also @xmath42 as the rest mass of both particles , then using the following relation , @xmath43 and obtain cm energy as the following , @xmath44 where , @xmath45 and we used the following re - scaling , @xmath46 it is clear that near the black hole ( @xmath47 ) we have @xmath48 and cm energy will be infinite as expected .",
    "in order to find effect of black hole charge on the cm energy , first we study uncharged black hole . if we set @xmath16 , then @xmath49 and cm energy will be , @xmath50 where , @xmath51 from the fig .",
    "1 we can see that the maximum energy is near the black hole horizon .",
    "choosing @xmath52 and @xmath53 tells that @xmath54 which yields to @xmath55 , while the maximum of cm energy is about 4.8 .",
    "also we see negative energy in the fig . 1 which shows regions far from the black hole . however at @xmath56 , as we expected , the cm energy yields to zero .    , @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "then solid line drawn for @xmath59 and dashed line for @xmath60 . ]",
    "in that case we set @xmath61 and find that the black hole charge restricted to have positive cm energy near the black hole . by choosing @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 we obtain @xmath62 is necessary to have positive energy near the black hole horizon . in that case",
    "we find that the black hole charge may be decreased or increased the cm energy .",
    "this point illustrated in the fig .",
    "3 .    , @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . then , space - dotted line drawn for @xmath63 , dashed line drawn for @xmath64 , solid line drawn for @xmath65 and dotted line drawn for @xmath66 . ]    , @xmath52 .",
    "we choose @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . ]",
    "in this paper we considered stu black hole and calculate center of mass energy of two colliding particles near the black hole horizon .",
    "we found that the black hole charge may be increased or decreased the cm energy which depend on distance from the black hole .",
    "also it is clear that the cm energy on the black hole horizon will be infinite .",
    "+ we found that far from the black hole the cm energy yields to zero and black hole charge is not important parameter . + for the future work and complete this job it is interesting to discuss about cm energy in extremal limits of stu black hole , also one can consider this black hole in the flat space .",
