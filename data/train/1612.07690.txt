    "a supersolid is a spatially ordered material with superfluid properties . practically , since the discovery of superfluidity by p.  kapitza , j.  f.  allen and d.  misener  @xcite , there have been constant efforts to understand and find systems that exhibit supersolidity . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the most plausible mechanism of supersolidity is based on the so called andreev - lifshitz - chester scenario  @xcite . in this theory",
    "it is assumed that vacancies , empty sites normally occupied by particles in an ideal crystal , exist even at absolute zero .",
    "these vacancies might be caused by quantum fluctuations , which also causes them to move from site to site .",
    "because vacancies are bosons , if such clouds of vacancies can exist at very low temperature @xmath0 , then a bose - einstein condensation of vacancies could occur at temperatures less than a few tenths of a kelvin .",
    "a coherent flow of vacancies is equivalent to a `` superflow '' ( frictionless flow ) of particles in the opposite direction . despite the presence of the gas of vacancies , the ordered structure of a crystal",
    "is maintained , although with less than one particle on each lattice site on average  @xcite .",
    "shevchenko presented another scenario for supersolidity , in which mass flow occurs along dislocation cores forming a 3d networks  @xcite .",
    "this models has many difficulties , since it requires large density of dislocations and their interconnections .",
    "supersolidity regarded from this point of view is inevitably connected to the question whether solid helium is a quantum crystal ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "leggett@xcite was perhaps the first to propose various direct test of supersolidity , but so far there is no clear evidence for supersolidity in the ground state ( @xmath1 ) in superfluid @xmath2he , and there is an ongoing debate  @xcite .",
    "the debate concerns the effects of elasticity , the presence of defects due to preparation , or the absence of vacancies at @xmath1 ( cf .",
    "anderson argued recently@xcite that bose fluids above the critical temperature may behave as incompressible vortex fluids and this may explain recent experimental results concerning `` supersolidity '' .",
    "recent intensive studies of helium crystals by balibar s group , on the other hand , suggest : ( i ) no supersolidity in bulk @xmath2he crystals ; ( ii ) no clear evidence for superfluidity in defects of @xmath2he crystals except from simulations ; ( iii ) clear evidence for quantum tunneling of kinks on dislocations , and @xmath3he impurities in bulk @xmath2he .",
    "more recently trapped ultracold atoms or molecules with dipolar  @xcite , or induced soft - core interactions  @xcite .",
    "rydberg - dressed atomic systems are also very promising candidates to display the supersolidity , when confined in an optical lattice @xcite have been proposed as candidates to realize supersolid structures .",
    "optical lattices provide a perfect playground for many exotic and challenging phenomena  @xcite : they are amazingly clean ( perfect lattices with no defects at all ) and highly controllable ( with respect to interactions , lattice height , filling , number of defects , etc ) .",
    "several works have predicted the possibility of creating supersolids with atoms / molecules interacting via dipolar forces  @xcite .",
    "the supersolid state may be also induced dynamically in systems with short range interactions as an out - of - equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , spin - orbit coupling in bose - einstein condensates can be used to create supersolid stripes as recently observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we believe that optical lattices provide also an ideal setup to study the andreev - lifshitz - chester mechanism , since they permit to :    * create a ground state with vacancies ( not possible in helium ) ; * create a microscopic number of defects , by removing some atoms using atom - microscope techniques  @xcite ( which should also be a feasible scenario for helium ) ; * create a macroscopic number of defects by appropriate loading ( not feasible regime for helium ) .    in the last case",
    ", a mismatch between two characteristic momenta  corresponding to effective fermi and brillouin zone  is expected to result in complicated spatial correlations .    in this paper",
    "we investigate this possibility and study a one - dimensional bose gas with short - range repulsive interactions in an optical lattice at incommensurate filling .",
    "we confirm that it provides a perfect candidate to study the andreev - lifshitz - chester scenario for supersolidity .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate how the presence of vacancies leads to the appearance of superfluidity with modulated density , i.e. the genuine ground state supersolidity .",
    "of course , modulation in the present study is not spontaneous ",
    "it is caused by the presence of the optical lattice .",
    "we expect , however , that the same mechanism will be effecting in lattice gases with dipolar or soft core potentials , and will be responsible for formation of supersolids at low commensurate fillings and at spontaneous appearance e of density modulations at periodicities lager than the lattice constant ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the detailed analysis of this mechanism in dipolar gases will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "we begin by discussing the case of infinite interactions ( tonks - girardeau limit ) in section  [ sec : tg ] and analyze the single particle excitation spectrum in a homogeneous system in section  [ sec : tg : hom ] and in the presence of an optical lattice in section  [ sec : tg : lattice ] .",
