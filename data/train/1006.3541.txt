    "a _ grid _ @xmath0 has vertex set @xmath1 , and edge set @xmath2 .",
    "grids are often thought of in terms of their usual graphical representation , where vertices are the intersection points of lines that cross over each other in a regular pattern , as illustrated in figure  [ figgridgraphs](a ) .",
    "grids are planar bipartite graphs .",
    "a _ unit - length embedding _ ( or _ embedding _ , for short , throughout the whole text ) is a mapping from the vertex set of a graph @xmath3 to a subset of the points of a grid , along with an incidence - preserving assignment of the edges of @xmath3 to unit - length grid segments .",
    "we refer to such set of points and unit - length segments as a grid _ drawing_. two embeddings are equal if they correspond to the same drawing , short of rotation , translation and reflection .",
    "a _ partial grid _ is any subgraph ( not necessarily induced ) of a grid , and can also be characterized as a graph that admits a unit - length embedding .",
    "grid embeddings are widely studied due to applications in vlsi design  @xcite and simulation of parallel architectures  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , deciding whether a graph admits a unit - length embedding is np - complete  @xcite , even when restricted to binary trees  @xcite .",
    "indeed the so - called _ logic engine paradigm _ for proving the np - hardness of problems in graph drawing is described in  @xcite , where the seminal references  @xcite and further applications  @xcite are discussed . on the other hand , in the context of graph theory",
    ", the recognition of partial grid graphs is often stated as an open problem  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph .",
    "the vertex and edge sets of @xmath3 are denoted @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and @xmath6 stands for the degree of vertex @xmath7 in @xmath3 .",
    "now let @xmath8 be a set of integers .",
    "we say @xmath3 is a @xmath8-_graph _ if , for all @xmath9 , we have @xmath10 , e.g.  paths are \\{1,2}-graphs , cycles are \\{2}-graphs , a complete graph on @xmath11 vertices is a \\{@xmath12}-graph etc .",
    "figure  [ figgridgraphs](b ) illustrates a \\{1,2,4}-tree .",
    "the partial - grid recognition problem ( pgr ) asks whether a graph @xmath3 is a partial grid . in this paper",
    ", we establish the problem s complexity dichotomy into polynomial and np - complete when the input is restricted to @xmath8-graphs , for every @xmath13 , thus exhausting all possible sets whose elements can be found as vertex degrees in partial grid graphs .",
    "all graphs we consider are connected , since the problem can be solved independently for each connected component of a disconnected graph .",
    "moreover , we will certainly use the facts that , ( i ) if the problem is np - complete for @xmath8-trees , then it is also np - complete for @xmath14-trees , @xmath15 , and for @xmath8-graphs and @xmath14-graphs  allowing cycles  as well ( _ superset property _ ) ; and , analogously , if the problem is polynomial for @xmath8-graphs , then it is also polynomial for @xmath14-graphs , @xmath16 , and for @xmath8-trees and @xmath14-trees as well ( _ subset property _ ) .    in section  [ secprelim ] , we revisit the seminal np - completeness proofs and define the basic concepts for the sections to come .",
    "section  [ seccd ] is the core of the present paper , addressing the complexity of each outstanding case  we either prove its np - completeness , or state its triviality , or give a polynomial - time algorithm when applicable .    additionally , motivated by recent advances in three - dimensional chip manufacturing  @xcite , we consider the natural three - dimensional version of the problem in section  [ sec3d ] .",
    "we then illustrate the power of our techniques by proving simple theorems that settle the complexity classes of recognizing 3d partial grids for the vast majority of acceptable input degrees .",
    "section  [ secconclusion ] closes the paper with concluding remarks and open problems .",
    "( a ) the grid @xmath17 .",
    "( b ) unit - length embedding for a \\{1,2,4}-tree . ]",
    "let @xmath3 be a graph .",
    "we say @xmath18 is a _ consistent orientation _ for @xmath3 when it holds that , if @xmath3 is a partial grid , then there is an embedding for @xmath3 where every edge in @xmath19 is drawn horizontally , and every edge in @xmath20 is drawn vertically on the grid .",
    "note that , if @xmath3 is not a partial grid , then any boolean function is a consistent orientationfor @xmath3 .",
    "we say two graphs @xmath21 have the same _ immersibility _ if ( i ) both @xmath22 and @xmath23 are partial grids , or ( ii ) neither @xmath22 or @xmath23 is a partial grid .    in  @xcite , bhatt and cosmadakis proved that deciding the existence of unit - length embeddings for arbitrary trees is np - complete .",
    "their proof was based on the reduction of the well - known np - complete problem not - all - equal 3cnf sat ( not - all - equal conjunctive - normal - form satisfiability with 3 literals per clause ) to the problem of deciding the existence of a unit - length embedding for a special \\{1,2,4}-tree they define , called the _ extended skeleton _ ( see figure  [ figskeleton ] ) .",
    "this problem is referred to as the bhatt - cosmadakis problem .",
    "grid embedding for bhatt and cosmadakis s extended skeleton @xmath24 associated to the 3cnf formula @xmath25 .",
    "the existence of such embedding for @xmath24 relates to the existence of a satisfying assignment for @xmath26 , namely @xmath27 . ]    though we will not give the details of such special tree here , the following fact is of utmost importance :    [ pro : known_orientations ] if @xmath24 is an extended skeleton , then a consistent orientation for @xmath24 can be determined in polynomial time .",
    "an extended skeleton @xmath24 comprises a subgraph @xmath28 , called _ skeleton _ , and a set of edges in @xmath29 , called _ flags _ ( flags are shown in bold lines , in figure  [ figskeleton ] ) .",
    "the skeleton is itself a partial grid which can not accept two distinct embeddings , due to the rigidity granted by its main and transversal _ spinal cords _ ( the main spinal cord can be easily pinpointed in figure  [ figskeleton]it comprises the long path of 4-degree vertices drawn in a straight horizontal line ) .",
    "the flags , on their turn , can only be embedded with the same orientation as the edges in the main spinal cord . on these grounds ,",
    "the algorithm in figure  [ algsphi ] gives a consistent orientation for @xmath24 in polynomial time , and fact  [ pro : known_orientations ] follows .",

    "<S> we provide such a classification based on the set of allowed vertex degrees in the input graphs , yielding a full dichotomy on the complexity of the problem . as byproducts , the previous np - completeness result for binary trees was strengthened to strictly binary trees , and the three - dimensional version of the problem was for the first time proven to be np - complete . </S>",
    "<S> our results were made possible by introducing the concepts of consistent orientations and robust gadgets , and by showing how the former allows np - completeness proofs by local replacement even in the absence of the latter . </S>"
