    "this leads to linear in @xmath7 upper critical field @xmath8@xcite . at zero temperature",
    ", @xmath9 is normally below the clogston - chandrasekhar @xcite or the pauli pair - breaking limit given by @xmath10 ( in tesla ) for the singlet pairing .",
    "recent high - magnetic - field studies in cuprates @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and pnictide superconductors @xcite , spin - ladders @xcite and organic superconductors @xcite have revealed a non - bcs upward curvature of the resistive @xmath3 . in some cases @xcite",
    "the pauli limit was exceeded by several times .",
    "a non - linear temperature dependence in the vicinity of tc has been unambiguously observed in a few samples @xcite .",
    "the observation of the departure from the bcs behaviour creates some controversy in the interpretation of the resistive critical field @xcite .",
    "if in some cases there are little doubts that the resistive transition corresponds to the upper critical field @xmath4 @xcite , some measurements on high temperature superconductors suggest that the real upper critical field is much higher than the resistive transition @xcite .",
    "indeed , the thermodynamic determination of @xmath4@xcite and anomalous diamagnetism above the resistive transition @xcite seem to justify such a conclusion .",
    "several theoretical concepts have been proposed in order to explain a non - bcs upward curvature of the resistive @xmath3 . some of the concepts are based on the fact that the size of the pairs is smaller than the average distance between electrons and therefore superconducting state may be approximated by the weakly interacting charged bose gas@xcite . in that case",
    "upper critical field has universal temperature dependence @xmath13 near @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "another approach is based on the multiband picture @xcite . in the case",
    "when the fermi surface has few sheets the gaps on different branches of the fermi surface are independent functions with different coupling constants .",
    "in such a system the upper critical field may deviate considerably from the classical bcs behaviour leading to the weak upward curvature in the temperature dependence of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "similar temperature dependence of the upper critical field may be caused by the field induced mixture of the superconducting gaps of different symmetries@xcite .",
    "on the basis of the phenomenological ginzburg - landau approach it has been suggested that in addition to the d - wave gap the external field may lead to generation of the s - wave@xcite , additional d - wave@xcite or p - wave@xcite components of the order parameter .",
    "this effect is caused by the fact that symmetry allows nontrivial gradient terms in the free energy@xcite including lifshitz invariants@xcite .",
    "this type of coupling may also lead to unusual temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath3@xcite .",
    "this type of ginzburg - landau equations were later derived from gorkov equations assuming nonlocal potential between electrons@xcite .",

    "we generalize werthamer - helfand - hohenberg ( whh ) theory @xcite to the case of a nonlocal interaction between electrons .",
    "it allows us to go beyond the high - temperature limit and consider the upper critical field behavior caused by the intermixture of the different order parameters at arbitrary temperature .",
    "we demonstrate that the nonlocal interaction is characterized by the parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi momentum and @xmath2 is the radius of electron - electron interaction .",
    "we show that in the presence of the external magnetic field the finite radius of electron - electron interaction leads to the generation of additional components of the order parameter with different angular dependence .",
    "this effect leads to the enhancement of the upper critical field above the orbital limiting field as well as to the upward curvature in the temperature dependence of @xmath3 in the clean limit .",
    "the increase of the impurity concentration suppress the effect .",
    "we consider superconductor with a non - local pairing potential @xmath15 that explicitly depends on coordinates @xmath16 and can be characterized by the radius of interaction @xmath2 .",

    "the equation of motion for the field operator @xmath22 derived from the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the order parameter of the superconductor .",
    "in contrast to the bcs model the order parameter explicitly depends on two coordinates @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    multiplying equation ( [ motion1 ] ) to @xmath27 we obtain the equation for the anomalous green s function @xmath28 .",
    "we write this equation in terms of matsubara frequencies @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is integer @xmath31 the anomalous green s function is closely related to the order parameter @xmath32 in the present study we are interested in the upper critical field .",
    "the order parameter at magnetic field close to critical is small .",
    "it allows us to use a normal state expression for the normal green s function @xmath33 @xcite .",

    "the variable @xmath40 describes the relative motion of electrons in the cooper pair .",
    "it appears due to the non - local pairing potential and describes the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "if we select local pairing potential @xmath41 , @xmath36 should be always equal to zero .",
    "our theory is reduced to the conventional bcs theory in this case . in the more general case the important values of @xmath36 are of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "the internal coordinate @xmath36 allows an additional degree of freedom to the superconductivity .",
    "we are especially interested in the angular dependance of @xmath36 .",
    "we will show that the order parameter can be divided into the components related to the different angular momenta of @xmath36 .",
    "these components are independent without the external magnetic field . in the magnetic field",
    "these components are intermixed .",
    "it can lead to the upward curvature of @xmath3 dependence . in the present study we focus on the 2d case .",
    "it may be realized experimentally in the atomically thin films or in very anisotropic superconductors similar to high-@xmath6 superconductors . in this case",
    "the components of the order parameter can be classified by the projection of the angular momentum on the axis perpendicular to the 2d plane . in principle",
    "a similar theory can be formulated in 3d when the components of the order parameter are classified by the value of the angular momentum .",
    "however this issue goes beyond of the present study .",
    "we start our consideration from the clean limit ( @xmath42 ) where the mean free path @xmath43 is much larger that the coherence length @xmath44 of the superconductor . in this case",
    "we neglect the effects of the impurities and we can give an explicit expression for the green s function .",
    "@xmath45 here we consider the limit @xmath46 .",
    "the expression ( [ gf ] ) corresponds to the normal green s function without magnetic field .",
    "the green s function in the magnetic field is related to @xmath47 as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "we also neglect the paramagnetic effects assuming that they are small as @xmath50",
    ". these effects may be important in the case where the upper critical field reaches pauli pair - breaking limit .",
    "this usually occurs due to strong impurity scattering .",
    "however , as it will be shown later , strong impurity scattering suppresses the field induced mixture of pairing with different angular momenta .",
    "the equation for the order parameter with the green s functions ( [ gf ] ) is @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the kernel @xmath55    let us assume for simplicity that the pairing potential has the form @xmath56 , where @xmath2 plays the role of the interaction radius .",
    "the potential with the finite range of interaction leads to the formation of pairs with different angular momenta . indeed ,",
    "fourier components of the potential @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , depend only on polar angles @xmath59 of vectors @xmath60 . calculating the matrix elements",
    "@xmath61 we obtain : @xmath62 here @xmath63 is the bessel function .",
    "therefore this potential leads to the pairing in the channels with nonzero orbital moments @xmath30 with the critical temperatures @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that the strength of the pairing is determined by the parameter @xmath0 .",

    "when @xmath70 one of the channels with @xmath71 can have the largest @xmath6 and corresponds to the main order parameter of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "in real systems the smallest radius of interaction is determined by the screening radius and therefore the situation @xmath72 seems to be natural .",
    "similar to the conventional bcs theory we do not try to choose a realistic pairing potential . real interaction between electrons",
    "is complicated and may not be characterized by the potential . on the other hand we believe that the exact form potential is not very important for our results . all the final results will be expressed in terms of critical temperatures @xmath73 in different pairing channels ( see eqs.(19),(21 ) and ( 29 ) ) .",
    "therefore the exact form of the potential drops out from our results .",
    "also we want to note that as long as the pairing potential acts only on the electrons near fermi surface it can be reduced to its dependence on angles @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "this dependence define @xmath76 in the eq .",

    "@xmath91 are not dependent on @xmath92 and can be considered as functions @xmath93 . moreover , this gauge allows us to relate different terms @xmath91 of the order parameter to different coordinate functions @xmath94 @xmath95 that correspond to the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator . here",

    "the coordinate dependence ( [ delta - x ] ) reduces the integral equation ( [ eqnd+d- ] ) to a matrix equation .",
    "the size of the matrix is formally infinite .",

    "the calculated critical fields for this case are presented on fig.1 .",

    "note that the curves in the dirty limit are below the orbital limiting field ( eq.(22 ) ) . on the other hand the curve of @xmath3 in the clean limit and for @xmath174 exceeds substantially the orbital limiting field .",
    "therefore we can conclude that finite radius of interaction substantially increases the critical field only in the clean limit . in the dirty limit the critical temperature in the channels with @xmath111",

    "accordingly in the intermediate points of the ladder shown on the figure [ fig : ladder - r ] both green s functions corresponding to the upper and the lower lines end at the same coordinates @xmath202 , @xmath203 , etc . in terms of the kernels @xmath204 and @xmath143 it corresponds to @xmath205 in the intermediate points of the ladder .    in the main text we expanded the order parameter @xmath206 over the values of the angle moment of vector @xmath36 .",
    "it allows us to consider the kernel @xmath146 as a matrix @xmath207 . @xmath208 the possibility of non - zero @xmath30 is related to finite values of the bessel functions @xmath209 .",
    "the equation ( [ eqk - r ] ) also allows the matrix representation .",
    "however the intermediate points correspond to the impurity potential and to the effective value @xmath210 .",
    "therefore alongside with the matrix elements @xmath211 the equation includes @xmath212 the resulting matrix equation reads @xmath213 where the term of the kernel @xmath214 satisfy the equation : @xmath215    in the equation ( [ knn1 ] ) we substituted the dependence on the coordinate @xmath36 with the matrix .",
    "the next step is to reduce the coordinate @xmath35 to the matrix elements . to do it we choose the basis functions",
    "@xmath216 defined in eq.(14 ) in the main text .",
    "then we consider the kernels @xmath146 and @xmath217 as operators .",
    "for example , the kernel @xmath218 corresponds to the operator @xmath219 these operators can be represented with matrixes corresponding to the basis @xmath94 .",
    "it appears that analogously to the clean limit discussed in the main text the operators @xmath220 allow direct relation between indexes @xmath30 and @xmath148 : @xmath221 .",
    "the value @xmath108 corresponds to the leading order parameter .",
    "the indexes @xmath154 should be considered as @xmath67 for the purpose of this relation .",
    "the equations ( [ knn1],[k001 ] ) in this basis are reduced to @xmath222 @xmath223    the equations ( [ knn2],[k002 ] ) actually represent the solution of the equation ( [ eq0 ] ) .",
    "naturally , the matrix elements of zero - order kernel can be written explicitly @xmath224 where the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath225 have the absolute value @xmath2 and the polar angles @xmath74 and @xmath75 correspondingly .",
    "the matrix elements of the kernel @xmath211 can be obtained directly from @xmath156 with equations ( [ knn2],[k002 ] ) .",
    "the total kernel @xmath226 can be used to find the upper critical field as described in the main text ."
