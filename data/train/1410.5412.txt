    ", these zero - energy majorana bound states ( mbs ) can be used as the building blocks of a fault - tolerant quantum computer @xcite . recently , realistic materials such as chiral @xmath1-wave superconductors e.g. , strontium ruthenate@xcite , topological insulator - superconductor interfaces @xcite , fermionic cold atom gases @xcite , spin - orbit coupled semiconducting thin films @xcite and nanowires @xcite in proximity to conventional superconductors , all realizing an analog of topological spinless @xmath1-wave superconductors@xcite , have been proposed as hosts for mbs .",
    "recent experimental observations in semiconductor - superconductor heterostructures @xcite seem to support the presence of mbs in condensed matter systems , although any conclusive evidence for non - abelian statistics is still lacking @xcite .    in concurrent formal theoretical developments ,",
    "recent work @xcite established that the quadratic hamiltonians describing gapped topological insulators and topological superconductors ( ts ) can be classified into ten distinct topological symmetry classes , and that each is characterized by a topological invariant counting the number of topologically protected edge modes . according to this classification ,",
    "the experimentally investigated semiconductor - superconductor heterostructures @xcite belong to the topological class d in which mbs are protected by the superconducting particle - hole ( ph ) symmetry .",
    "additionally , one - dimensional topological superconductors belonging to the time reversal class diii@xcite and bdi @xcite have recently been proposed .",
    "diii topological superconductivity is indexed by a @xmath2 topological invariant indicating the presence or absence of a majorana kramers pair , while in bdi topological superconductivity , for instance as recently proposed@xcite in the context of putative spin - triplet ferromagnetic superconductors such as the organic superconductors and lithium purple bronze ( @xmath3 ) , a @xmath4 invariant counts the number of mbs .",
    "very recent experimental work @xcite suggests that atomic scale ferromagnetic fe nanowires on the [ 110 ] surface of superconducting pb may support majorana modes and topological superconductivity . the theoretical prediction that proximity induced superconductivity in ferromagnetic ( or half - metallic ",
    "a half - metal is a perfect ferromagnet with complete spin - polarization at the fermi level ) wires might lead to a topological superconducting phase with the associated localized majorana zero energy modes was made some years ago by several groups @xcite .",
    "there was even an experimental report of the observation of long - range superconducting proximity effect through a ferromagnetic nanowire @xcite .",
    "very recently , two theoretical papers @xcite have predicted the possible existence of topological superconductivity in ferromagnetic nanowires lying on superconducting substrates using shiba chain @xcite and a one - dimensional nanowire@xcite model , respectively , closely mimicking the experimental system ( i.e. fe atoms on superconducting pb ) studied in ref .  .",
    "extensive recent theoretical work by different groups has suggested several different mechanisms which could lead to mbs - carrying ts in magnetic nanowires placed on superconducting substrates .",
    "the earliest such mechanisms @xcite modeled the nanowire as a chain of magnetic impurities in a spin - spiral phase . the spin - spiral , following previous work @xcite , is used to mimic an effective spin - orbit coupling that would in turn lead to an effective triplet pairing superconducting proximity effect from the singlet superconducting substrate , exactly as in the existing semiconductor nanowire models of topological superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the magnetic impurities were suggested to generate an array of yu - shiba - rusinov @xcite bound states in the superconductor .",
    "the combined effect of the superconductivity and spin - texture leads to an effective kitaev chain model @xcite that can support majorana bound states under appropriate conditions @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical plausibility of creating such a spin - spiral phase@xcite was debated , and it was shown that such spin spirals are unstable toward the formation of purely ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic phases @xcite .    the absence of a spin - spiral in the experimental system has led to the conjecture of an alternative mechanism involving the strong spin - orbit coupling of the pb superconducting substrate itself contributing to topological superconductivity in the magnetic nanowire @xcite . the basic model , which has been studied in this context by several authors @xcite , proposes that only the spin - triplet component of cooper pairing , _ if any _",
    ", may be proximity - induced in a ferromagnetic wire from a spin - orbit coupled superconductor .",
    "this mechanism has previously been proposed as an approach to topological superconductivity @xcite and also been invoked @xcite to explain the long - range proximity - effect observed through ferromagnetic nanowires @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of triplet proximity effect on a ferromagnetic wire arising from a spin - orbit coupled superconducting substrate has been studied in detail by three of us recently and shown to potentially support mbs - carrying topological superconductivity in the bdi chiral symmetry class @xcite .",
    "such a symmetry would suggest unsplit majorana modes whenever the effective chemical potential in the ferromagnetic wire is positive .    in this context",
    "it is useful , particularly for later discussion of the experimental results @xcite , to briefly review two realistic theoretical models for topological superconductivity , and majorana bound states , in one - dimensional ( or quasi - one - dimensional ) ferromagnetic nanowires ( fe in ref .  )",
    "lying on a two - dimensional surface of an underlying bulk superconductor ( pb in ref .  ) .",
    "one model , which we refer to as the shiba model ( or shiba chain model ) , discussed in refs .   and",
    "respectively for the helical and the ferromagnetic magnetic order in the wire , describes the magnetic atoms ( fe in ref .  )",
    "as essentially independent quenched classical magnetic impurities with little direct inter - atomic hopping along the chain , i.e. the one - dimensional band width of the chain is basically zero ( or equivalently , vanishing inter - atomic hopping amplitude @xmath5 ) .",
    "the other model , which we refer to as the nanowire ( or simply , the wire ) model , introduced in ref .   for the ferromagnetic order in the magnetic chain , describes the ferromagnetic chain as strongly directly tunnel - coupled along the chain with considerable inter - atom hopping leading to one - dimensional bands of fairly large band - widths ( or equivalently , large inter - atomic hopping amplitude @xmath5 ) .",
    "these two models have been recently introduced and studied in the context of a ferromagnetic chain on a superconductor ( i.e. the experimental system of ref .  ) in refs .   and respectively .",
    "the accompanying band structure calculations for the fe chain on pb presented in the experimental work @xcite indicate that the hoping term on the chain @xmath5 is of the order of @xmath6 whereas the superconducting gap in pb is of course of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "given the large ratio between the hopping and superconducting parameters , as quoted in ref .",
    ", the system can be modeled within the nanowire model . as we discuss later in this work , this fundamental inconsistency between different aspects of the results presented in ref",
    ".   remains unresolved with the reported induced topological gap being @xmath8 and the observed strong lattice - level , @xmath9 , localization of the majorana mode requiring an estimated superconducting gap of @xmath10 .",
    "this basic incompatible dichotomy must be resolved ( see below for a discussion of a recent work [ 60 ] in this context ) before the observations of ref .",
    "can be considered to be evidence for the existence of localized mbs in the fe / pb hybrid system .    a possible resolution of this apparent paradox , i.e. that of a very small proximity induced superconducting gap in the nanowire and a very small associated coherence length giving rise to strongly localized majorana edge modes , has very recently been proposed in ref .",
    "by peng et al . using a zero - temperature theory of a helical magnetic chain on a superconducting substrate .",
    "the basic idea , originally studied in refs .",
    ", for 2d heterostructures made of semiconductor / superconductor @xcite or topological - insulator / superconductor @xcite sandwich systems , is that the presence of the superconducting substrate could substantially renormalize the parameters of the effective induced superconductivity , leading to a situation where the effective parameters determining the proximity superconductivity are radically different from those applying to an isolated p - wave superconducting system ( i.e. without any substrate ) . in particular ,",
    "peng et al .",
    "explicitly show@xcite , by using a minimal mean - field - theoretical model of a linear helical chain of anderson magnetic adatom impurities on a bulk superconductor , that a strong velocity renormalization in the wire induced by the substrate could lead to a small majorana localization length in spite of the wire having a small induced superconducting gap . if this physics is indeed operational in the experimental system of ref .",
    ", then the lowering of temperature should show considerable sharpening of the zero - bias peak in future experiments even if the induced gap itself remains small .",
    "our interest in the current work is , however , a theoretical modeling of the high - temperature situation ( with the induced gap being comparable to the temperature ) as studied in ref .  ,",
    "and the precise majorana localization itself is not particularly important for considering the high - temperature situation as we show in the finite - temperature results presented in this paper .",
    "one issue directly resolved by peng et al .",
    "@xcite is that the ferromagnetic nanowire model considered in this work and the shiba model are _ not _ separated by any quantum phase transition  they are two extreme aspects of the same underlying crossover physics akin to the bcs - bec crossover in superfluidity / superconductivity with the appropriateness of each description being determined by underlying experimental parameters .",
    "we mention , however , that the key parameter underlying the strong majorana localization established in ref .",
    "is the strength of the tunneling between the substrate and the adatom chain , and experimentally there is no information on how strong this tunneling is . when this tunneling is weak ( strong ) , the ferromagnetic wire ( shiba chain ) model applies . in the current work",
    ", we primarily follow the ferromagnetic nanowire model since this is the description used in ref .   itself to describe the data ,",
    "although we specifically show ( see figs .  18 and 19 ) that at the high experimental temperatures used in ref .  , the tunneling conductance measured experimentally would look very similar in either the ferromagnetic or the shiba model , and the physics of strong majorana localization would become relevant only if the experimental temperature is lowered to well below ( less than half at least ) the induced superconducting gap in the nanowire .",
    "we emphasize again that the shiba and nanowire models are two extreme and complementary aspects of the same underlying physics ( i.e. the physics of a linear array of ferromagnetic magnetic atoms lying on a 2d or 3d superconducting substrate with strong spin - orbit coupling in the environment  a 1d magnetic chain on a 2d or 3d superconducting substrate in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling ) , and there is no phase transition between the two situations .",
    "indeed the models can be understood as two limiting cases where the weak ( strong ) hopping between d - band orbitals corresponds to the shiba ( nanowire ) regime@xcite . with our main interest in the current work being the role of temperature ( compared with the induced superconducting gap in the wire ) ,",
    "it should not matter which model is used , although the nature of the majorana mode localization scales are very different in the two models@xcite depending on the crossover parameter given by the tunneling hybridization scale between the superconductor and the magnetic chain .",
    "an extremely important physical parameter in the experiment of ref .",
    "is the very high experimental temperature ( @xmath11 ) which is comparable to the estimated induced topological superconducting gap ( @xmath12 ) extracted in ref .  .",
    "the fact that @xmath13 in the experiment makes any discussion of a precise zero - energy majorana mode quite meaningless because at such high temperatures , the majorana response will be broadened over the whole subgap regime ( or perhaps even above the gap ) with the majorana signal indistinguishable from any ordinary fermionic subgap state .",
    "we also point out that the experiment of ref .   does not actually observe any obvious superconducting gap in the ferromagnetic nanowire , and",
    "the evidence for the existence of any topological gap is indirect .",
    "in fact , the instrumental energy resolution in ref .   is also of the order of the topological gap and the temperature , making any discussion of possible weak subgap features as representing anything definitive somewhat premature . given that the experiments in ref .",
    "are carried out at temperatures equal to the induced superconducting gap using an experimental instrumental resolution also comparable to the gap , we believe that any subgap features would manifest very broad and very weak differential tunneling conductance peak consistent with the observations , and only a lowering of the temperature in future experiments can distinguish possible zero - bias majorana features from fermionic subgap features .    our goal in the current paper is a detailed numerical modeling of temperature effects in the ferromagnetic nanowire - superconductor hybrid system in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling in order to provide qualitative ( and semiquantitative ) insight into the physics of the system studied in ref .  .",
    "the current work is an extension of ref .   carried out in the context of the putative experimental mbs observation claimed in ref .   in order to provide a detailed critical comparison between theory and experiment , which is necessary since the rather strong claim of a direct observation of majorana modes must be thoroughly validated from all possible perspectives .",
    "it may be useful in this context to emphasize that the recent spurt in the experimental mbs activity , including both the earlier work on semiconductor ( insb and inas ) nanowires @xcite and the very recent work on fe nanowires@xcite , is completely dependent on theoretical predictions and analyses for its validation since the observations themselves involving tiny zero - bias tunneling conductance peaks at low temperatures in rather complex hybrid systems are remarkably unremarkable , becoming noteworthy only because theories specifically predicted that such zero - bias tunneling peaks should exist in these specific hybrid structures as mbs signatures .",
    "in particular , ref .   not only predicted the existence of the majorana bound states in semiconductor - superconductor hybrid structures , specifically laying out the type of structures ( and the materials ) experiments should use , but also carried out realistic calculations showing that the resulting mbs - induced zero - bias tunneling peaks should have a small height ( because of finite temperatures , tunnel barrier heights , and wire lengths ) compared to the expected quantized value @xcite associated with the perfect andreev reflection anticipated for mbs .",
    "this early paper@xcite also specifically suggested the use of stm in order to look for topological zero energy majorana excitations in hybrid systems as has eventually been accomplished in ref .",
    "following the later suggestion in ref .   of using an stm coupled specifically with a magnetic chain on a superconductor .",
    "while topological superconductivity in the chiral symmetry class has been established for ferromagnetic wires with a single spatial orbital per atom , the number of majorana modes arising from such a model is limited to two . on the other hand , the band - structure calculation for the experimentally realistic system @xcite suggests that the number of channels in the wire can be significantly enhanced by the presence of multiple orbitals per atom and multiple atoms along the diameter of the chain . in this work",
    ", we consider a multichannel generalization of the fm heterostructure and its topological properties starting from the nanowire model of ref .  .",
    "non - trivial zero - bias phenomena appear across a broad range of parameters in contrast to the fine tuning necessary for a non - trivial topological phase in class d @xcite or diii systems @xcite . within this framework , manipulating the system width ( i.e. coupling parallel magnetic chains ) enhances or reduces the zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) height accordingly .",
    "manipulation of the zero - bias conductivity tuned by the width of the magnetic chain would be a direct signature of the chiral class bdi topological superconductors .",
    "additionally , we calculate spatially resolved scanning tunneling conductance profiles including effects of finite temperature and finite size of the wire ( as well as the finite tunnel barrier effects ) which are experimentally accessible by stm .",
    "finally , we show that the fractional josephson effect maintains its @xmath14 periodicity in phases supporting multiple spatially overlapping mbs and comment on how the josephson current may be enhanced in the presence of majorana multiplets @xcite for a definitive conclusion regarding the existence of mbs in the ferromagnetic nanowire system of ref .",
    ".    it may be useful to point out the connection between mbs in much - studied semiconductor nanowire systems with that in the new platform of interest in ref .   involving ferromagnetic nanowires .",
    "although it may appear at first sight that the two systems are completely distinct , from a theoretical perspective the mbs in the ferromagnetic wires are described by essentially the same theory as developed earlier for the semiconductor nanowires in refs . , provided that one is in the nanowire limit of large inter - atomic hopping along the chain ( and not in the shiba limit ) , and that one is in the limit of the spin splitting ( induced in the semiconductor case by an external magnetic field or by a proximate exchange splitting ) being very large ( much larger than the other energy scales in the problem including the spin - orbit coupling energy , the fermi energy , and the superconducting gap in the ferromagnetic wire case ) . in this large spin - splitting limit ,",
    "the semiconductor system is also essentially an effective  half - metallic ferromagnet \" exactly as the fe wire studied in ref .",
    "is claimed to be . in the semiconductor nanowire case also",
    ", the topological superconducting phase will be generic in this very large spin - splitting limit since the chemical potential would by definition be in the single spin polarized subband , with the superconducting gap being smaller than the spin splitting .",
    "thus , the distinction made between semiconductor nanowires and magnetic nanowires with respect to topological superconductivity is a distinction without much difference , since one can take the existing theory for the semiconductor nanowire and obtain all the necessary formula for the ferromagnetic wire case by assuming the spin - splitting to be by far the largest energy scale .",
    "( we provide the details on this connection to the semiconductor nanowire system in appendix a ) .",
    "we emphasize , however , the obvious fact that although the ferromagnetic wire case can be thought to be a limiting situation ( i.e. very large spin - splitting limit ) of the semiconducting nanowire majorana theory , the two experimental systems ( namely , the semiconductor nanowire in the presence of an external magnetic field inducing spin - splitting and the ferromagnetic nanowire with its spontaneous exchange - driven spin - splitting ) are , of course , completely different physical platforms from an experimental perspective utilizing totally different materials and measurement techniques .",
    "the emergence of this ferromagnetic nanowire platform @xcite , in addition to the already existing semiconductor nanowire platforms @xcite , is therefore an exciting new development in the search for mbs and topological quantum computation .",
    "taken very close to a sample surface , an stm can be used as an electrode to measure transport properties ( fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "a movable scanning point contact tunneling experiment is potentially very useful in investigating the edge character of majorana zero modes since the stm is particularly well - suited in measuring the local density of states .",
    "this idea , originally proposed in ref . , is rather impressively implemented in the highly demanding spin - polarized stm measurements presented in ref .  .",
    "provided the electrical contact is good between the ferromagnet ( fe nanowire ) and the superconducting substrate ( pb ) , cooper pairs will leak into the ferromagnet , thereby proximity inducing superconductivity in the nanowire .",

    "one could of course assume that the measured gap already incorporates the disorder effect ( starting from a much larger clean topological gap ) , but this would imply very strong dependence of the measured topological gap on the wire length , not reported in ref .  .    in the next section ,",

    "are taken into account .",
    "the most compelling qualitative features of the experimental stm results presented in ref .  , providing evidence for zero - energy majorana modes in fe chains lying on superconducting pb substrates , are the existence of a ( weak and broad ) zero - bias differential tunneling conductance peak spatially localized near the ends of the chains which seems to disappear as the stm tip probes the middle regions of the chains away from the ends .",
    "this observation of a zero - bias peak seemingly spatially localized at the wire ends while being a necessary signature for majorana modes as pointed out a long time ago@xcite is , however , not sufficient ( see the next section for the chiral fractional josephson effect which could serve as a sufficient condition ) .",
    "the puzzling features of the experimental observation @xcite are many : ( i ) the lack of any obvious superconducting gap manifesting in the stm data on the fe nanowire although a striking gap , in precise quantitative agreement with the bcs theory , shows up for the pb substrate itself ; ( ii ) the observed zero - bias peak is minuscule , being reduced by a factor of @xmath239 to @xmath240 from the canonical @xmath155 zero - bias conductance associated with the perfect andreev reflection from the majorana mode ; ( iii ) the zero - bias peak is exceptionally broad , being comparable to the estimated topological superconducting gap in the nanowire ; ( iv ) the experimental temperature is comparable to the estimated topological superconducting gap which makes it very difficult , if not impossible , to discuss features associated with majorana modes ; ( v ) the very small topological gap implies very long coherence length , and consequently , long majorana localization length ( @xmath241 ) , which makes the experimental observation of the spatial localization of the majorana modes to atomic sharpness ( @xmath242 ) very puzzling to say the least since given that the experimental coherence length is @xmath243 ; ( vi ) the observed strong particle - hole asymmetry is puzzling since the majorana mode and the subgap bdg spectrum should obey - particle hole symmetry ; ( vii ) given the small topological gap and the consequent long superconducting coherence length in the nanowire , it is unclear why ( and how ) the majorana modes could be at zero energy since there should be considerable hybridization between the two end majorana modes leading to split quasi - majorana subgap modes away from zero energy ; ( viii ) connected with the last item , the long coherence length ( @xmath244 ) and the short lengths of the nanowire ( @xmath245 ) used in the experiment imply that considerable majorana splitting oscillations should manifest themselves in the experiment ( since the coherence length is greater than the wire length ) , which are , however , not seen ; ( ix ) no obvious majorana peak ( even split peaks ) is seen in the very short ( @xmath246 ) wires ; ( x ) the stm gap signature for superconductivity which manifests itself strikingly in the pb substrate itself away from the nanowire , disappears completely on the nanowire without any obvious signature for the shiba subgap states in the pb superconducting gap as should be expected for fe , a magnetic impurity , on pb , an ordinary @xmath247-wave superconductor ( unless , of course , the weak peaks being identified as majorana modes are really the subgap shiba states induced by fe in pb ) .",
    "some of the problems with the majorana interpretation of the data in ref .   have already been mentioned in the earlier sections of this paper , but we summarize all of them tougher right in the beginning of this section because we will provide detailed numerical results in this section establishing that , in spite of all these problems the observations in ref .",
    "are not inconsistent with the majorana interpretation , but any definitive conclusion would necessitate much lower measurement temperatures and much higher instrumental resolution , as well as a system exhibiting a more definitive topological gap .    first , the high measurement temperature ( @xmath248 ) suppresses and broadens all features associated with any induced superconducting gap and all associated subgap features ( majorana or non - majorana ) , thus making it difficult to observe any majorana energy splitting oscillations since the features are simply too weak . to make this point explicit , we show in figs .",
    "10 - 12 our calculated stm tunneling spectra on the superconducting ferromagnetic nanowire at the wire end ( @xmath163 ) for three different temperatures ( @xmath249 ) , two different topological gap values ( @xmath250 ) , and four different wire lengths ( @xmath251 ) with a typical coherence lengths being @xmath252 ( for @xmath179 ) and @xmath253 ( for @xmath226 ) .",
    "we have chosen the temperature , the topological gap , the wire length and the stm tunnel barrier strength at the tip ( @xmath204 ) to be qualitatively consistent with the experimental results , and , by construction , the voltage bias region ( @xmath254 ) chosen along the abscissa focuses entirely on the possible majorana physics in the topological gap of the ferromagnetic wire .",
    "we note that since our model has , by construction , no subgap states other than the majorana zero modes ( which may very well be split due to hybridization in the finite wire ) , any subgap structure manifesting itself in our results , by definition , arises from the majorana fermions . the most prominent feature of figs .",
    "10 - 12 is that , although the @xmath42 majorana peaks are sharp and may manifest energy splitting ( the magnitude of the splitting decreases with increasing wire length ) as expected theoretically , the finite temperature differential conductance at @xmath163 for all four wire lengths shows very broad features ( with the broadening being comparable to or even larger than the topological gap itself ) with a weak smooth peak at zero energy . for the smallest gap ( @xmath226 in fig .",
    "11 ) and for the shorter wires ( @xmath255 ) , the peak is actually asymmetric and in fact goes out of the gap region ( see fig .",
    "11 ) due to the majorana overlap .",
    "these features are all consistent with the experiment where a very weak and very broad zero bias peak is seen only in the longer wires ( at the wire ends ) , and for shorter wires , the peak is not observed .    to understand the absence of any split majorana peaks or majorana oscillations away from the ends of the fe wire in the experiment",

    "in fact , all traces of majorana modes , have disappeared completely around @xmath213 in the finite temperature results in agreement with the experimental finding , although the superconducting coherence length ( @xmath258 , certainly @xmath259 ) is long enough that one would expect ( as found at @xmath42 ) signatures of majorana oscillations at @xmath213 .",
    "again , the high experimental temperature compared with the induced superconducting gap in the nanowire is responsible for the suppression of majorana oscillations .    finally in figs .  16 and 17 we show color plots for the spatial profiles of the differential conductance calculated at @xmath42 ( fig .",

    "10 - 15 : ( i ) the conductance is mostly localized at the wire ends at the finite temperatures of the experiments , and ( ii ) in shorter wires ( @xmath261 ) the majorana peak is pushed out of the gap due to strong hybridization making it impossible to observe .",
    "both of these findings are consistent with experiment as emphasized already .",
    "we note that there is an additional element of physics , beyond the the scope of the current work , which may lead to further spatial localization of the majorana modes as observed in the experimental system studied in ref .  .",
    "this is the effective system dimensionally of the experimental setup , which has been assumed to be almost purely one - dimensional in the current work with all substrate degrees of freedom associated with pb being integrated away .",

    "explicitly illustrates how the majorana decay length exceeds the chain length in the limit of weak hybridization between the host superconductor and magnetic impurities ( i.e. the nanowire limit ) , while if the hybridization is strong ( shiba limit ) the modified superconducting band structure indicates a strong renormalization of the fermi velocity @xmath265 which modifies the majorana coherence length ( recall @xmath266 ) .",
    "obviously a rigorous inclusion of this enhanced localization effect ( because of the denominator ) is well beyond the scope of the current effective 1d theory , but we could incorporate the denominator approximately by multiplying the majorana overlap term by @xmath267 ( 2d ) or @xmath268 ( 3d ) compared with our calculated 1d result .",

    "since our model has no subgap states other than the majorana zero modes by construction , we can conclude that the experimental observations are indeed superficially consistent with the majorana theory .",
    "this is , however , an important achievement since at first sight , the very long superconducting coherence length associated with the very small topological gap appears to be prima facie inconsistent with the spatial localization of the majorana modes at the wire ends .",
    "we have shown that , given the high temperature and poor experimental resolution ( as well as extremely weak sm tunneling strength ) , that majorana features away from the wire ends ( as well as any majorana energy splitting effects due to hybridization ) are simply not observable in the current experiment .",
    "we have also shown that these same experimental limitations lead to the non - manifestation of any majorana - like features in short wires as the split - majorana zero modes are pushed essentially above the topological gap where thy are unobservable . only going to temperatures much lower than the topological gap values",
    "can decisively determine whether the observed weak and broad zero bias peak has anything to do with majorana bound states or are arising from other subgap states present in the system .",
    "we mention before concluding that very recent theoretical work has appeared in the literature @xcite , after the original submission of our work , suggesting that the ferromagnetic shiba chain model @xcite rather than the ferromagnetic nanowire model @xcite might be the appropriate starting point for the physics underlying the system studied in ref .  .",
    "notably , ref .   illustrates that if this indeed the case , the majorana decay length can be strongly renormalized leading to general qualitative agreement between theory and experiment at zero temperature .",
    "we have , however , shown that the tunneling conductance at high temperatures ( comparable to the induced gap ) is qualitatively the same in both the ferromagnetic nanowire ( weakly localized majorana ) and the shiba chain ( strongly localized majorana ) model , and thus experiments at temperatures much lower than the induced gap are necessary for any definitive conclusion .",
    "if the majorana modes are indeed strongly localized , then the zero - bias peak should become very sharp at low temperatures in long wires whereas clear majorana splitting should be observable for shorter chains .",
    "such observations of sharp zero - bias peaks ( split peaks ) for long ( short ) chains at low temperature will be the definitive evidence for the experimental observation of topological edge modes for fe chains on pb substrates .",
    "however , a very recent work@xcite even suggests that the observations of ref .   can be simply explained by the appearance of shiba bound states ( rather than majorana zero modes ) in the system without any need to invoke any topological superconductivity .",
    "we emphasize that ( @xmath302 ) these theoretical suggestions , while interesting , are not yet experimentally validated , and ( @xmath303 ) temperature effects studied in our work are not discussed at all in these works and , based on our results shown in fig .",
    "19 , we conclude that thermal effects are similar in the shiba chain model and the ferromagnetic nanowire model as long as the induced gap remains comparable to the experimental temperature . only temperatures much lower than the induced superconducting gap could distinguish between the shiba chain and the ferromagnetic nanowire models , and",
    "we hope that our results will encourage experiments at much lower temperatures .",
    "we conclude now with a succinct discussion ( see the appendix ) of the theoretical novelty of the ferromagnetic nanowire platform as compared with the semiconductor nanowire platform studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "one apparent important qualitative difference seems to be that the semiconductor nanowire necessitates a fine - tuning of the zeeman splitting ( or chemical potential ) whereas the ferromagnetic platform manifests generic majorana zero modes without fine - tuning by virtue of its very large exchange - induced spin splitting .",
    "it turns out , however ( the details are provided in the appendix ) , that the ferromagnetic nanowire is simply a special limiting case of the semiconductor nanowire majorana problem with @xmath304 , where @xmath75 , @xmath305 and @xmath23 are the ferromagnetic exchange spin splitting in the nanowire ( or the external magnetic field induced zeeman spin splitting in the semiconductor nanowire ) , the superconducting gap and the chemical potential respectively . since the condition @xmath304 is presumably satisfied in the experimental system of ref .   according to the recent band structure calculations@xcite ,",
    "the ferromagnetic nanowire platform is simply a special ( and interesting ) limit of the already well - studied semiconductor nanowire case .",
    "we provide these details in the appendix .",
    "this work is supported by lps - cmtc and jqi - nsf - pfc at the university of maryland and by afosr ( fa9550 - 13 - 1 - 0045 ) at clemson university .",
    "we show here that the topological properties of the fm wire on an sc substrate in the presence of spin - orbit coupling follow directly from those in the extensively studied superconductor - semiconductor hybrid system in the limit of very large spin splitting . using eq .",
    "( 33 ) from ref .   in the semiconductor - superconductor system , we have for the clean - limit quasiparticle gap @xmath40 in the topological superconducting state : @xmath306 where @xmath307 is the proximity induced topological gap ( in the fe wire ) , @xmath30 is the @xmath247-wave pairing potential in the substrate ( pb in our case ) , @xmath308 is the spin - orbit coupling required to induce @xmath1-wave proximity pairing from an @xmath247-wave sc as originally discussed in ref .  , @xmath309 is the ( exchange ) spin splitting in the fe nanowire , and @xmath310 is the tunneling energy coupling the substrate sc ( pb ) and the nanowire ( fe ) , essential for inducing the proximity effect in the nanowire .",
    "we note that it makes no difference in obtaining eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] whether the spin - orbit coupling energy @xmath311 arises from the substrate or the nanowire .",
    "the condition for the existence of the topological phase ( and the applicability of eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] describing the effective @xmath1-wave topological gap in the nanowire ) is the following ( c.f .",
    "( 35 ) in ref .",
    "): @xmath312 ( i.e. @xmath313 ) where @xmath23 is the chemical potential in the nanowire .    restricting now to the fm nanowire on the sc substrate of our interest here @xcite , we consider the extremely large spin - splitting situation given by @xmath314 where we conclude that the topological condition is trivially satisfied generically , without tuning of parameters ( as long as @xmath315 is large enough for the fe system to be a half - metal ) as in eq .",
    "[ eq : topo_condition ] since spin - splitting is by far the largest energy scale .",
    "this leads to the immediate ( and somewhat trivial ) conclusion that , as long as eq .",
    "[ eq : fm_limit ] is satisfied , the system is in the topological phase with no fine - tuning necessary .",
    "this is assumed to be the situation in ref .   and in ref .",
    "( where detailed band structure results for the experimental system are provided ) as already emphasized in ref .",
    "this generic existence of a topological phase in the ferromagnetic nanowire , however , comes with the heavy price of a minuscule topological gap @xmath31 as is obvious by taking the @xmath316 limit in eq .",
    "[ eq : delta ] : @xmath317 note that there are two terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : minuscule ] ( within the two parenthesis ) have different physical origins : the first term , @xmath318 , is the proximity effect induced by the substrate itself and the second term , @xmath319 , is the topological effect in the magnetic wire .",
    "writing the first term as @xmath320 where @xmath321 is essentially the @xmath247-wave pairing potential induced in the wire by the substrate we obtain the useful relation : @xmath322 we note that eq .",
    "[ eq : delta_p ] has recently been quoted in ref .   as a new result without the realization that this formula is simply a special limit of the earlier topological theories studied in the context of semiconductor nanowire majorana fermions .",
    "[ eq : delta_p ] defines the operational equation for the topological induced gap in the ferromagnetic nanowire , establishing clearly that the ferromagnetic wire on a superconducting substrate is not a new majorana platform at all from the _ theoretical perspective _ , but is simply a large spin - splitting limit of the well - studied topological semiconductor system .",
    "this point may not have been emphasized in the recent publications @xcite on this topic .",
    "one immediate consequence of the large spin - splitting limit is that that topological gap is suppressed by the factor @xmath315 , which is the largest scale in the problem . since @xmath323 ( at best ) and @xmath324 whereas @xmath325 in the pb - fe hybrid system , one gets an agreement with the experimental findings in ref .",
    "@xmath326 thus , a minuscule topological gap is the price one must pay to have a generic topological phase in the ferromagnetic nanowire problem .",
    "we see no escape from this small gap conundrum for the fe on pb topological platform .",
    "using the semiconductor nanowire analogy , we can also estimate the effect of disorder on the topological gap .",
    "it is known that although the disorder in the substrate superconductor has no effect on the topological gap ( by virtue of anderson s theorem ) any disorder in the fe wire itself has a profound detrimental effect @xcite on the topological gap since p - wave superconductivity is vulnerable to elastic scattering as anderson s theorem does not apply in the topological wire itself .    using the existing work in semiconductor nanowires",
    "@xcite we have ( see eq.(20 ) in ref .  ) the following condition for the requisite elastic disorder scattering time for topological superconductivity to be possible in the hybrid system : @xmath327 this indicates that the system is highly susceptible to disorder in the large @xmath315 limit ( since @xmath328 , we conclude that we must have @xmath329 , requiring very long scattering times for the survival of topological superconductors ) and we can easily obtain a crude numerical estimate by equating the induced topological gap @xmath31 with the disorder - induced level broadening @xmath330 to write the condition for the survival of the topological superconductivity in the fe wire as : @xmath331 converting the above condition to a minimum necessary mean free path ( @xmath332 ) in the fe chain , by using @xmath333 as quoted in ref .",
    "and from the known material parameters for the fe wire , we conclude that the following condition on the fe chain mean free path would be necessary for the observation of the majorana zero modes : @xmath334 since the nanowires used in ref .",
    "are shorter that this minimum required mean free path ( and by definition , a mean free path can not be longer than the system length ) , we conclude that any majorana zero mode would be strongly suppressed by disorder effects in the fe nanowire .",
    "a simple way of appreciating the disorder problem in the fe / pb system is to note that the reported topological gap ( @xmath335 ) is @xmath336 , where @xmath5 is the typical hopping energy in the fe chain .",
    "this means that any fluctuation or error in @xmath5 arising , for example , from the expected lack of an absolutely precise periodic arrangement of the fe atoms along the chain ( or from environmental impurities and defects ) must be well below 1 part in @xmath337 for a robust topological gap .",
    "this is a rather demanding requirement .",
