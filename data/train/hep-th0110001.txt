    "the conjecture that the only long - range information associated with the endpoint of gravitational collapse is that of its total mass , angular momentum and electric charge is referred to as the no - hair conjecture of black holes @xcite .",
    "much work has been carried out over the years on this conjecture , either upholding it in certain instances ( e.g. scalar fields @xcite ) or challenging it in others , such painting yang - mills , quantum hair @xcite or nielsen - olesen vortices @xcite on black holes .",
    "in fact the uniqueness of the classical no - hair theorems is a qualified uniqueness@xcite , incorporating additional criteria associated with stability , non trivial topology , and the possibility of field configurations on the horizon ( referred to as ` dressing ' ) , and one must be quite specific about what is meant by ` hair ' @xcite .",
    "the study of nielsen - olesen vortices in the background of the charged black holes was done in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and @xcite .",
    "virtually all efforts in this area have been concerned with asymptotically flat spacetimes , and it is only recently that extensions to other types of asymptotia have been considered .",
    "scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity can not provide hair for asymptotically de sitter black holes @xcite , but can do so if the spacetime is asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) @xcite . a solution to the @xmath3 einstein - yang - mills equations that describes a stable yang - mills hairy asymptotically",
    "ads black hole has been shown to exist @xcite . in a recent paper with dehghani",
    ", we have shown that the @xmath4 higgs field equations have a vortex solution in both four dimensional ads spacetime @xcite and ads - schwarzschild backgrounds @xcite .     in this paper",
    "we extend our investigation of possible vortex hair for non - asymptotically flat black holes to include rotation and charge .",
    "specifically , we seek numerical solutions of the abelian - higgs field equations in the four dimensional rotating kerr - ads and reissner - nordstrom - ads black hole backgrounds .",
    "although an analytic or approximate solution to these equations appears to be intractable , we confirm by numerical calculation that kerr - ads and reissner - nordstrom - ads black holes could support a long range vortex ( or cosmic string ) as a form of stable hair .",
    "this is the first demonstration that rotating black holds can carry abelian higgs hair , for both the asymptotically flat and asymptotically ads cases .",
    "we also show ( to first order in the gravitational coupling ) that the effect of the vortex on a rotating black hole is to create a deficit angle through the spacetime , analogous to its non - rotating counterpart .",
    "we consider the question of flux - expulsion by extremal black holes and find that in the case of extremal kerr - ads , kerr and reissner - nordstrom - ads black holes , an extremal horizon is indeed pierced by the vortex , and its flux is not expelled from the black holes .",
    "this not only confirms earlier computations of non - expulsion of vortex lines @xcite for the extremal reissner - nordstrom case , but also proves the non - expulsion phenomenon to the extremal rotating case in asymptotically ads and asymptotically flat spacetimes . finally , we consider the dependence of the characteristic vortex on the rotation parameter of the black hole and find that it is qualitatively the same its dependence on the magnitude of the cosmological constant : an increase in both causes a decrease in the thickness of the core .",
    "in section two , we solve numerically the abelian - higgs equations in the kerr - ads background for different values of the cosmological constant and black hole rotation parameter . in section three , we consider the abelian - higgs equations in the limiting case of  kerr - ads background with cosmological constant to be zero , yielding the vortex equation in the kerr black hole background . in section four ,",
    "we repeat this calculation for a reissner - nordstrom - ads background for different values of the black hole charge . in the limiting case of reissner - nordstrom - ads black hole with cosmological constant to be zero , yielding reissner - nordstrom black hole ,",
    "our solution is in good agreement with the previous obtained results @xcite . in section five , by an analytical discussion , we obtain the effect of the vortex self gravity on the kerr black hole to the first order of gravitational constant .",
    "we establish that the effect of the vortex is to induce a deficit angle in the kerr background and find the deficit angle in terms of vortex fields .",
    "then in section six , by studying the behaviour of the string energy - momentum tensor , we find the effect of the vortex self gravity on the kerr - ads and reissner - nordstrom - ads black hole backgrounds .",
    "we give some closing remarks in the final section .",
    "the abelian higgs lagrangian is    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a complex  scalar klein - gordon field , @xmath8 is the field strength of  the electromagnetic field @xmath9 and @xmath10 in which @xmath11 is the covariant derivative in a spacetime with metric @xmath12 .",
    "we employ planck units @xmath13 which implies that the planck mass is equal to unity , and write the kerr - ads black hole metric in the analogue of boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath14 where @xmath15    @xmath16    and @xmath17 the parameter @xmath18 is related to the mass of the black hole @xmath19 by @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the angular momentum @xmath22 by @xmath23 the cosmological constant @xmath24 @xmath25is equal to @xmath26 the metric ( [ kerradsmetr1 ] ) is valid only where @xmath27 and is singular where @xmath28 if  @xmath29 @xmath30has at most two real roots and the event horizon is located at @xmath31 the largest real root of the equation @xmath32 for some values of the parameters @xmath33  the two real roots coincide in which case the kerr - ads black hole is extremal .",
    "if roots are not real , then the spacetime described by the metric ( [ kerradsmetr1 ] ) is a naked singularity . as in the non - rotating case",
    "@xcite , we define the real fields @xmath34 via the following equations    @xmath35    from which we can rewrite the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and the equations of motion in terms of these fields as @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the field strength of the corresponding gauge field @xmath39 .    provided the field @xmath40 is not single valued , the resultant solutions contain physical information and are referred to as vortex solutions @xcite .",
    "the requirement that @xmath7 be single - valued implies that the line integral of @xmath40 over any closed loop is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an integer .",
    "through such a closed loop the flux of electromagnetic field @xmath43is quantized with quanta @xmath44    we seek a vortex solution for the abelian higgs lagrangian ( [ lag2 ] ) in the background of kerr - ads black hole .",
    "this solution can be interpreted as a string piercing the black hole ( [ kerradsmetr1 ] ) .",
    "considering the static case of winding number @xmath45 with the gauge choice , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , we rescale @xmath48 where @xmath49 thereby obtaining    @xmath50    @xmath51    for the equations of motion ( [ eqmo2 ] ) , where @xmath52 the equations ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) in the special cases of  @xmath53 and @xmath54 reduce to the equations of motion of the vortex in the schwarzschild - ads and ads backgrounds respectively @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we emphasize that even in the simplest case of an abelian higgs vortex in asymptotically flat spacetime ( ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) in the limit @xmath55  @xmath56 ) , no solution that is everywhere analytic has been found .  indeed ,",
    "even for @xmath57  no exact analytic solutions are known for equations ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "furthermore , no vortex solutions have ever been obtained for rotating black hole spacetimes .",
    "we now proceed with a numerical search for the existence of vortex solutions for the above coupled non linear partial differential equations .",
    "first , we consider the _ thin _ string with winding number one , in which one can assume @xmath58 thicker vortices and larger winding numbers will be discussed later in this section .",
    "employing the ansatz    @xmath59    where @xmath60 ,  we obtain the following equations :    @xmath61    @xmath62    where the functions @xmath63 and @xmath64 are given by , @xmath65 @xmath66    when @xmath67 the vortex solutions of the abelian higgs equations in flat spacetime ( without a black hole ) satisfy the @xmath68 limit of equations up to errors which are proportional to @xmath69@xcite@xmath70 these errors are very tiny far from the black hole horizon , whereas near the horizon @xmath71 they are of the order of @xmath72 which is negligible for large mass black holes .",
    "this suggests that a string vortex solution could be painted to the horizon of a schwarzschild black hole , and numerical calculations @xcite have indeed shown the existence of vortex solutions of the abelian higgs equations in this background .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for finite @xmath73 . for  @xmath56 ( and @xmath74 ) we have shown in a previous paper @xcite that the abelian higgs equations of motion  in the background of anti - de - sitter spacetime ( ( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) in the limit of  @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) have vortex solutions ( denoted by @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) with core radius @xmath77 .",
    "the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) up to errors which are proportional to @xmath78 although these errors go to zero far from the black hole , for a large mass black hole , @xmath79 , the term @xmath80 is at least of  the order of unity , and so the possibility of obtaining a string vortex solution for finite @xmath73 in this background is unclear .     by numerically solving eqs .",
    "( [ eqx2],[eqp2 ] ) in the @xmath56 case we have shown that vortex solutions exist on , near and far from the horizon of the ads - schwarzschild black hole for various winding numbers and different values of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "as in the asymptotically flat case the results indicate that increasing the winding number yields a greater vortex thickness .",
    "furthermore as @xmath73 decreases the black hole becomes completely covered by a vortex of decreasingly large winding number .",
    "also , for a vortex with definite winding number , the string core decreases with decreasing @xmath81 but the ratio of string core to the size of the black hole horizon increases .",
    "the @xmath82  and @xmath83 fields less rapidly approach their respective maximum and minimum values at larger angles as @xmath73 decreases .    for finite values of the rotation parameter @xmath21 , equations ( [ eqx2 ] ) and ( [ eqp2 ] ) which are equivalent to equations ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) are considerably more complicated than in the @xmath56 case . to obtain numerical solutions of  ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) outside the black hole horizon we must first select appropriate boundary conditions . at large distances from the horizon",
    "physical considerations motivate a clear choice : we demand that the @xmath84  solutions approach the solutions of the vortex equations in pure ads spacetime given in ref .",
    "this means that we demand @xmath85 and @xmath86 as @xmath87 goes to infinity . on the symmetry axis of the string and beyond the radius of horizon @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we take @xmath91 and @xmath92 . finally ,",
    "on the horizon , we initially take @xmath93 and @xmath94    we then employ a polar grid of points @xmath95 where @xmath96 goes from @xmath88 to some large value of @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) which is much greater than @xmath88 and @xmath98 runs from @xmath99 to @xmath100  we use the finite difference method and rewrite the non linear partial differential equation ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) as @xmath101 @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 for the interior grid points and horizon grid points , the coefficients @xmath105 can be straightforwardly determined from the corresponding continued differential equations ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "the form of the coefficients is somewhat complicated , and we so relegate them to an appendix .    using the well known successive overrelaxation method @xcite for the above mentioned finite difference equations , we obtain the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields inside the grid , which we denote them by @xmath106 and @xmath107 . then by calculating the @xmath96-gradients of @xmath82 and @xmath83 just outside the horizon and iterating the finite difference equations on the horizon , we get the new values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields on the horizon points",
    ". then these new values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields are used as the new boundary condition on the horizon for the next step in obtaining the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields inside the grid which could be denoted by @xmath108 and @xmath109 . repeating this procedure ,",
    "the value of the each field in the @xmath110 -th iteration is related to the @xmath42-th iteration by    @xmath111    @xmath112    where the residual matrices @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the differences between the left and right hand sides of the equations ( [ findiffx][findiffxx ] ) and ( [ findiffxp ] ) respectively , evaluated in the @xmath42-th iteration and @xmath40 is the overrelaxation parameter .",
    "the iteration is performed many times to some value @xmath115 such that @xmath116 and @xmath117 for a given error @xmath118 .",
    "it is a matter of trial and error to find the value of @xmath40 that yields the most rapid convergence .",
    "some typical results of this calculation are displayed in figures ( [ fig1 ] ) , ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig4]),([fig5 ] ) , ( [ fig6 ] ) for different values of @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .  in the first case ,",
    "we consider both @xmath56 and @xmath121 and in the second case , we consider @xmath122  for @xmath123 , the black hole mass is taken to be the constant value @xmath124 whereas for @xmath120 the mass is taken to be @xmath125  in @xmath126 the horizon is located in @xmath127 for @xmath56 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 also , for the case of @xmath130 the horizon for different values of @xmath131 are @xmath132 respectively .",
    "for these two values of @xmath73 , the black holes are non - extremal for all values of @xmath21 .  the diagrams ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig4 ] ) when @xmath56 are exactly the same as the results of @xcite for the ads - schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we notice that by increasing the rotation parameter @xmath21 from @xmath99 to @xmath133 the string core decreases slightly in the @xmath134 kerr - ads black hole .",
    "figure ( [ fig3 ] ) shows explicitly the string core decreasing as the rotation parameter increases .",
    "the physical reason for the core size decreasing with increasing rotation parameter @xmath21  is due to a decrease in the horizon radius @xmath88 .",
    "this quantity is given by the root of equation ( [ deltar ] ) and decreases slowly as the parameter @xmath21  increases from@xmath135  to its maximum value .",
    "on the other hand , since we know from previous work that the string thickness compared to horizon radius drastically changes by changing unbounded physical quantities like the winding number or black hole mass , we expect that string core changes a little with changing the bounded black hole parameters like the rotation parameter @xmath21 . since the effect of increasing @xmath136  ( when @xmath56 ) is the same as the effect of decreasing @xmath21 on the value of the horizon size  @xmath137 we expect commensurate changes in the horizon size .",
    "indeed this is what we find : the core thickness increases with decreasing parameter @xmath21 , analogous to what happens when the value of @xmath73 is increased for @xmath56 .",
    "figure ( [ fig7 ] ) illustrates for @xmath120  a similar decrease of the string core as @xmath21  increases from @xmath99  to @xmath138  and then to @xmath139  confirming again our expectation .",
    "our numerical results agree with the above statement relating the horizon radius and different physical quantities of the black hole .",
    "similar calculations for the string with larger winding numbers in a kerr - ads black hole with definite parameters @xmath140 , show that increasing the winding number yields a greater vortex thickness .    for the extremal kerr - ads black hole with cosmological parameters @xmath130mass @xmath141  and rotation parameter @xmath142  we have calculated the vortex fields . in this case",
    "the horizon radius is located at @xmath143  we find that the behaviour of the vortex @xmath82  and @xmath83  fields are the same as the non - extremal cases .",
    "the contours of the @xmath82  and @xmath83  fields attach to the horizon in the same way they attach to the horizon of non extremal black holes presented in the figures [ fig1],[fig2],[fig4],[fig5],[fig6 ] .",
    "since the results are so similar to the non - extremal cases we do not present them here .",
    "the crucial point is that in the extremal case , no flux - expulsion is occurred in the thin vortex configuration .",
    "we consider here a special case of the preceding section , namely the abelian higgs vortex in a kerr black hole background .",
    "the kerr metric is a special case of  ( [ kerradsmetr1 ] ) in the limit @xmath144 the metric is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 the horizon is located in @xmath147 the equations of motion for the @xmath82 and @xmath83 fields can be obtained from the equations ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) in the limit of @xmath148 they are , @xmath149 @xmath150 we solved the differential equations ( [ eqxkerr ] ) and ( [ eqpkerr ] ) numerically , using the same approach employed in solving ( [ eqx ] ) and ( [ eqp ] ) .",
    "some typical results of the calculation are displayed in figures ( [ fig8 ] ) , ( [ fig9 ] ) and ( [ fig10 ] ) . in these calculations ,",
    "we consider a string with unit winding number in the background ( [ kerrmetr1 ] ) with @xmath151  along  the extremal case  @xmath152 . throughout the black hole mass",
    "is taken to be @xmath124 , and so the horizon is respectively located at @xmath153 , with @xmath154 in the extremal case .    the figures in ( [ fig8 ] ) , when @xmath56 are exactly the same as the results of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we note that in changing of the rotation parameter from a value of @xmath135 ( corresponding to a schwarzschild black hole ) to the extremal value of @xmath155 , both the @xmath82 and @xmath83 contours undergo only a small change .",
    "in fact , as the diagrams in figure ( [ fig11 ] ) show , we observe a change on the @xmath156 and @xmath157 contours . by increasing the rotation parameter ,",
    "both the @xmath82 and @xmath83 contours decrease a little .",
    "similar arguments regarding the decrease of the horizon of a kerr - ads black hole with increasing rotation parameter also apply to the kerr black hole , which explains the decrease of the string fields @xmath82  and @xmath158  in figure ( [ fig11 ] ) with increasing @xmath21 . in the extremal case",
    "we find that an extremal horizon is indeed pierced by a thin string , so the vortex flux is not expelled from the black hole .",
    "in this section , we consider the abelian higgs vortex lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) in the background of a charged black hole .",

    "the equations of motion derived from the lagrangian for the @xmath166 and @xmath167 fields after rescaling of coordinates in the background ( [ rnadsmetric ] ) are @xmath168 @xmath169    we note that in the special case @xmath170 , the equations of motion ( [ eqxrnads ] ) and ( [ eqprnads ] ) reduce to the equations of motion of the vortex in the background of ads - schwarzschild background studied in @xcite .",
    "also we note that in the special case of @xmath171 the above mentioned equations reduce to the equations of motion in the background of the reissner - nordstrom black hole discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider the static case of a string solution with winding number one .",

    "is presented in figure ( [ fig115 ] ) . as figure ( [ fig116 ] ) shows , by increasing the parameter @xmath73 from @xmath173 to @xmath174 the string core changes a little .",
    "such a tiny increase of string core also has been observed in the case of ads - schwarzschild black hole by increasing the parameter @xmath73 @xcite . in the special case of @xmath68 , a typical solution of ( [ eqxrnads ] ) and ( [ eqprnads ] ) for a reissner - nordstrom black hole with @xmath124 and @xmath175",

    "our results establish that flux - expulsion does not take place for extremal black holes , and that generically a cosmic vortex will pierce both rotating and charged black holes , with the stress - energy of the vortex inducing a deficit angle in these black hole metrics .",
    "other interesting issues concern the development of  a holographic description of the vortex solution in these spacetimes .",
    "the holographic description of a vortex in was given by a discontinuity in the logarithmic derivative of a scalar - two point function in a cft formulated on a spacetime with deficit angle .",
    "it is reasonable to conjecture that our extensions of vortex solutions to charged and rotating cases will yield a similar effect , but with the cft at a finite temperature due to the presence of the black hole event horizon .",
