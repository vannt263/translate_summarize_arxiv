    "the consideration of quantum effects in information theory has a rich history , starting with the pioneering work of gordon @xcite , and later pursued , among others , by helstrom @xcite and holevo @xcite .",
    "a trait shared by these works is the special role played by thermal noise and coherent states , the natural quantum counterpart of the gaussian model from classical communication theory .",
    "inspired by recent work on reference frames in information theory @xcite , where schumacher is quoted as saying that `` restrictions on the resources available for communication yield interesting communication theories '' , we consider , in addition to thermal noise , the effect of decoherence , by which we mean absence of a shared phase reference between transmitter and receiver , and deal with the information rate loss incurred by such restriction , viz .",
    "decoherence between transmitter and receiver .",
    "our work is related to the analysis of direct detection methods at optical frequencies @xcite in the sense that communication is non - coherent . however , the discrete channel model we use is different , as it represents the radiation field as a photon gas .",
    "details are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : semiclassicalmodel ] from a semiclassical perspective .",
    "the key element is that information is sent by modulating the energy of the fourier modes of the field ; at the receiver , energy is measured .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : channelcapacity ] we determine the channel capacity of the photon gas model and derive the main result of this paper , namely that decoherence leads to no loss in information rate when the signal - to - noise ratio lies below a threshold ; above the threshold , up to half of the capacity is lost . for a frequency @xmath0 ( in hertz ) , this threshold is approximately given by @xmath1 at 290 , and is thus large only for radio and microwave frequencies .",
    "previous studies of direct detection @xcite showed a non - negligible capacity penalty . in sec .",
    "[ sec : additiveenergyfield ] we relate this discrepancy to a different way of accounting for the energy of a mixture of thermal and coherent radiation .",
    "in this section , we present a semiclassical analysis of the effect of radiation decoherence .",
    "we consider one polarization of the electromagnetic field at an aperture , which we denote by @xmath2 , a complex - valued function . as is well - known",
    ", we can perform a fourier decomposition of the function @xmath2 onto frequencies of the form @xmath3 , lying in a band of width @xmath4 around a reference frequency @xmath5 ; here @xmath6 is the duration of the observation interval .",
    "further , the function @xmath2 is the sum @xmath7 , where the signal @xmath8 and noise @xmath9 are respectively given by @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the useful signal of mode @xmath12 , set at the transmitter ( except for a propagation loss and a phase rotation ) , and @xmath13 are samples of gaussian noise ; all quantities are complex . with coherent detection ,",
    "the quantities @xmath14 are recovered at the receiver @xcite .      an implicit assumption behind eq .",
    "is the existence of a shared phase reference between transmitter and receiver . in general",
    ", however , decoherence takes place and a phase drift @xmath15 , possibly a function of the fourier mode @xmath12 , appears . following lax s analysis of oscillator noise @xcite ,",
    "we model the phase drift @xmath15 as a brownian motion with zero mean and variance @xmath16 = 2\\pi\\beta_m t$ ] .",
    "the total signal at the receiving aperture is still given by @xmath17 , but the transmitted signal is now @xmath18    when @xmath19 , we obviously recover the coherent model .",
    "however , for any @xmath20 , however tiny , as the observation duration increases @xmath21 , then the signal in the @xmath12-th output of a coherent receiver vanishes , i.  e.@xmath22 in this case , a different detection method is required .",
    "fortunately , the energy in the @xmath12-th mode is well defined ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : additiveenergyfield ] ) by the sum @xmath23 .",
    "this suggests using a form of direct detection , which we now describe .    by construction",
    "the signal @xmath8 is a mixture of independent frequency tones .",
    "demultiplexing them at the receiver generates a set of parallel signals @xmath24 given by @xmath25 the instantaneous energy @xmath26 can be integrated in the interval @xmath27 to generate an output @xmath28 , @xmath29    there are now two possibilities , depending on how fast the phase noise @xmath15 varies in time .",
    "if @xmath15 is constant , i.  e.  @xmath19 , the output @xmath28 is given by @xmath30 as for the squared output of a coherent receiver . in the approximation that the energy is continuous , @xmath28 follows a non - central chi - square distribution ; its square root @xmath31 is distributed according to a rician distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "if the energy is discrete , the distribution of @xmath28 is laguerre with parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite . in the second alternative , we take @xmath34 , and then @xmath35 namely the sum of the energies of signal and noise . as mentioned previously , this condition holds true as @xmath21 as long as @xmath20 .",
    "if the energy is assumed discrete , then the signal component is modelled as a poisson random variable and the additive noise has a bose - einstein distribution @xcite .",
    "one can think of this model as a photon gas , where the receiver counts the number of photons in each fourier mode .",
    "otherwise , for a continuous - energy approximation , the noise energy @xmath33 has an exponential density , which is both the limiting form of a bose - einstein distribution and the density of the squared amplitude of complex gaussian noise @xcite .    the output @xmath28 in eq .",
    "is the sum of the energies of signal and noise .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that this additivity in energy does not hold for the laguerre distribution , the standard result for the superposition of a thermal field and a coherent state . in the next section",
    "we briefly review the derivation of the laguerre distribution and discuss the conditions under which energy is additive .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : channelcapacity ] we compare the information rates over the gaussian model with those achievable by an energy measurement .",
    "we then use the difference in information rates between the coherent and non - coherent models as an estimate of the effect of decoherence .      for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider the superposition of two continuous - time signals @xmath36 and @xmath37 . the instantaneous energy @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 with a beat term @xmath40 . even though its mean is zero",
    ", it is not identically zero .",
    "moreover it makes the total energy after integration different from the sum of the energies of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as in eq .  .",
    "we solve this issue by noting that the superposition model is not unitary and choose instead a unitary matrix to represent it .",
    "consider such a matrix @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a phase offset . instead of @xmath44",
    ", there are now two outputs , say @xmath45 and @xmath46 , linear combinations of the inputs , namely @xmath47 the instantaneous energy at each output , @xmath48 , is then @xmath49 where the sign @xmath50 goes with output @xmath51 .",
    "the total output is the sum over the two branches , @xmath52 .",
    "each output , observed individually , follows a laguerre distribution .",
    "however , the outputs are not independent but correlated through the beat term .",
    "as these terms have different sign , they cancel out when we sum the two outputs , and we indeed see that the total energy is the sum of the energy in the signal and the noise components .",
    "we have discussed two models , viz .  coherent detection and energy detection . for the latter ,",
    "we have in turn described two options , a photon gas model where the energy is discrete and an exponential noise model under the approximation that the energy is continuous .",
    "all cases are described by a channel model of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a measurement on the @xmath12-th fourier mode , @xmath11 the @xmath12-th signal component , @xmath55 the useful signal at the output , and @xmath13 the @xmath12-th sample of additive noise .",
    "the specifics of each model are    1 .   for coherent detection , @xmath54 , @xmath56 , and",
    "@xmath13 are complex - valued .",
    "further , @xmath13 are samples of gaussian noise with variance @xmath57 .",
    "2 .   for the photon gas model , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath13 are non - negative integers , a number of photons of energy @xmath58 each .",
    "the signal component @xmath55 has a poisson distribution with mean @xmath11 , and the noise component @xmath13 has an bose - einstein ( or geometric ) distribution with mean @xmath59 , as thermal radiation . here",
    "@xmath0 is assumed constant for all modes , and equal to @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is a temperature .",
    "3 .   for continuous energy , @xmath54 , @xmath56 and @xmath13",
    "are non - negative real numbers .",
    "then , @xmath13 are samples of exponential noise with mean @xmath60 .    in all cases , a constraint on the signal energy @xmath61 is imposed , where @xmath62 is the average number of signal photons , and @xmath63 the corresponding energy . moreover",
    ", it is convenient to set @xmath64 . for the first and third models , we define an average signal - to - noise ratio @xmath65 as @xmath66 .",
    "the largest information rate that can be sent over a channel with output conditional density @xmath67 is the channel capacity @xmath68 @xcite , given by @xmath69 where the maximization is over all input densities @xmath70 satisfying the energy constraint , and @xmath71 is the mutual information between channel input and output . for continuous output",
    "the mutual information is given by @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "for discrete output , the integrals over @xmath74 should be replaced by sums .      in classical information theory , the capacity @xmath75 is given by the well - known shannon formula @xcite , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is a common approximation to the noise spectral density .",
    "in addition , with a quantum model for measurement , noise is additive gaussian with variance @xmath78 @xcite , and one obtains the quantum capacity with coherent detection @xmath79 , given by @xmath80 at radio and microwave frequencies , @xmath81 and we recover shannon s formula , @xmath82 these expressions give the information rates with thermal noise and in absence of decoherence .      in the photon gas model , two sources of noise",
    "are present at the output : poisson noise , arising from the signal itself , and additive noise .",
    "distinct behaviour is to be expected depending on which noise prevails . in a first approximation ,",
    "the behaviour is determined by the noise variance .",
    "the additive noise variance is given by @xmath83 ( it follows a bose - einstein distribution ) , whereas the signal variance @xmath62 ( it is a poisson random variable ) @xcite .",
    "of practical importance is the region where @xmath84 , for which the variances coincide when @xmath85 .",
    "when @xmath62 is below the threshold , additive noise prevails ; above the threshold , poisson noise dominates .    in appendix",
    "[ sec : upperbounds ] we prove that the capacity @xmath86 of the photon gas model is upper bounded by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are respectively given by @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the entropy of a geometric distribution with mean @xmath92 , given by @xmath93 . note that @xmath94 does not depend on @xmath95 .    both functions @xmath88 and @xmath89 are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath62 .",
    "they have a crossing point , whose position we now determine under the approximation @xmath84 and @xmath96 .",
    "we can then use the asymptotic forms of the upper bounds to the capacity , @xmath97 and we obtain again the expression @xmath98 , previously derived by reasoning in terms of noise variance .    the threshold can be written in terms of the signal - to - noise ratio of the underlying classical channel , @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath0 is the frequency ( in hertz ) . in decibels ,",
    "@xmath101 , where the frequency is in ghz .",
    "next to the upper bounds , we derive in appendix  [ sec : lowerbound ] a lower bound to the capacity .",
    "its value is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an incomplete gamma function , @xmath104 .",
    "the threshold can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : t20061026 ] , which depicts the upper and lower bounds to the capacity as a function of the input number of quanta @xmath62 and for several values of @xmath95 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds are close , differing by at most 1.1 .",
    "the looseness at low @xmath62 is due to the pessimistic estimate of the conditional output entropy @xmath105 ( details are given in appendix  [ sec : lowerbound ] ) , which is smaller than the gaussian approximation we have used . at high @xmath62 the gap is likely due to the non - optimal input distribution , a gamma density with @xmath106 , the density used in @xcite on the bound the capacity of the discrete - time poisson channel would likely close this gap .",
    "the capacity is closely given by the upper bound in eq .  .",
    "]    as proved in appendix  [ sec : upperboundbounds ] , for finite values of @xmath62 , @xmath107 is bounded by @xmath108 the information rates over the photon gas model are strictly smaller than those of the classical limit with signal energy @xmath61 and noise @xmath109 . nevertheless , the loss due to decoherence is negligible when @xmath110 ; here we assumed that the upper bound to the capacity is tight ( see comments above and sec .",
    "[ sec : capacityaen ] ) . on the other hand , above this energy level , the upper bound @xmath89 becomes dominant , and eventually half of the achievable information rate is lost to decoherence .",
    "a connection , worthwhile mentioning , can be made with non - coherent communications in gaussian channels @xcite , where one of the two signal quadratures is not used , and a similar change in slope in the capacity takes place .",
    "a similar limitation arises in phase - noise limited channels @xcite .",
    "as the threshold @xmath111 is close to the point where existing digital communication systems using electromagnetic radiation suffer from the effects of phase noise , it would be interesting to verify which of the two models defines most accurately the effective channel capacity . regarding this issue , note that the cost in information rates of maintaining the phase coherence between transmitter and receiver are usually ignored .      under the approximation that the energy is continuous , poisson noise vanishes , in the sense that the density of the random variable signal energy approaches a delta function , @xmath112 . in addition",
    ", the bose - einstein distribution collapses onto an exponential density .",
    "the capacity of a channel with additive exponential noise was studied by verd @xcite .",
    "applied to our channel model , we obtain the somewhat surprising @xmath113 as in the classical limit with gaussian noise .",
    "of course , this was to be expected since this model is a good description of the regime where @xmath88 accurately gives the capacity , and the formula here follows from @xmath88 as @xmath114 .",
    "in this paper , we have compared two models for the transmission of information via electromagnetic radiation : the standard wave model with gaussian noise and an alternative as a photon gas , where the radiation is an ensemble of photons over a set of fourier modes .",
    "the second model represents a scenario with decoherence in the form of absence of phase reference between transmitter and receiver .",
    "we have limited our analysis of decoherence to coherent states ( in a semiclassical formulation ) and do not consider quantum states such as squeezed states or fock states , neither the use of entanglement .",
    "even though decoherence makes the von neumann entropy of the source radiation states increase @xcite , it does not necessarily lead to an information rate loss , even though the quadrature components of the field are not used separately .",
    "essentially , the entropy of the received signal is determined by that of thermal radiation , if the signal energy is below a threshold .",
    "a simple approximation for this threshold has been given .",
    "below this threshold , there is no information loss caused by decoherence ; above it , up to half of the chanel capacity is lost .",
    "capacity - achieving systems at radio and microwave frequencies operate below the threshold ; optical systems are known to suffer from phase noise @xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to find a practical example whose information rates , including the cost of maintaining coherence , would exceed that of the photon gas model .",
    "we conjecture that the information rates of practical communication systems are bounded by the capacity of the photon gas model and may be thus significantly smaller than those obtained from a gaussian model .    finally , we mention that the photon gas model is somewhat close to a representation of classical matter as a set of particles , and that the results presented in this paper may be of help in exploring the quantum - classical border for radiation . differently from other examples of decoherence @xcite ,",
    "the time scales at which einselection ( in a quantum formulation of our semiclassical analysis ) takes place are easily controllable , and therefore in principle observable , as opposed to decoherence in matter .",
    "for any input @xmath115 the mutual information satisfies @xmath116 as the geometric distribution has the highest entropy under the given constraints @xcite . then , @xmath117 because the entropy of a sum of two independent random variables is at least as large as than the entropy of each of them ( exercise  18 of chapter  2 of @xcite ) and @xmath118 and @xmath119 are independent .",
    "therefore , @xmath120 as this holds for all inputs the upper bound @xmath88 follows .    the variables @xmath119 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 form a markov chain in this order , @xmath123 , so that an application of the data processing inequality @xcite yields @xmath124 that is the mutual information achievable in the discrete - time poisson channel ; a good upper bound to the capacity of the latter was given in @xcite .",
    "our lower bound is derived from the mutual information achievable by a specific input with density @xmath125 it is easy to prove that the channel output induced by this input achieves the largest output entropy ; a similar proof can be found in @xcite for the exponential noise channel . as a particular case",
    "we recover the exponential input , which maximizes the output entropy of a discrete - time poisson channel @xcite .    by construction ,",
    "the output is bose - einstein ( geometric ) with mean @xmath126 and the output entropy @xmath127 is therefore given by @xmath128 .",
    "we compute the mutual information with this input as @xmath129 .",
    "we estimate the conditional entropy as @xmath130 we obtain a term @xmath131 , which can be computed as @xmath132 .",
    "a second summand is upper bounded by the differential entropy of a gaussian random variable ( see theorem  9.7.1 of @xcite ) , @xmath133 the desired expression follows from carrying out the integration and using the definition of the incomplete gamma function .",
    "first , we prove the strict inequality @xmath134 for all values of @xmath135 , @xmath136 . using the definition of @xmath88 , we rewrite this expression as @xmath137",
    "proving this is equivalent to proving that the function @xmath138is monotonically increasing for @xmath139 .",
    "it is indeed so since its first derivative @xmath140 is @xmath141 which is positive since @xmath142 for positive @xmath143 .",
    "we now move on to prove @xmath144 from the definition of @xmath88 , and after cancelling common terms , we rewrite the condition as @xmath145 this equation is true because the function @xmath146 is monotonically increasing for @xmath139 , since it monotonically approaches the number @xmath147 from below ."
