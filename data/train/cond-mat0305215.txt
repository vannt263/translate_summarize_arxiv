    "the electronic potentials and dipole moments are calculated with the configuration - interaction ( ci ) valence bond method .",

    "is that the electronic molecular wavefunction @xmath11 is constructed from wavefunctions , which are products of wavefunctions that describe the constituent atoms @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in essence , the molecular wavefunction is given by @xmath14 where each @xmath15 is an antisymmetrized ( @xmath16 ) product of two atomic slater determinants @xmath17 the atomic slater determinants @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constructed from one - electron functions centered on the nucleus of atom @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the variational ci coefficients @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) are obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue matrix problem , since in our approach the @xmath21 are not orthogonal .",
    "the permanent molecular dipole moment of the molecular wavefunction @xmath11 is calculated from @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the total number of electrons in the molecule and @xmath24 is the electron charge .",
    "the first term of eq .",
    "[ dipole ] depends on the position @xmath25 and charge @xmath26 of nuclei @xmath27 and @xmath13 and is zero by choosing an appropriate coordinate origin . the second term of eq .",

    "@xmath32 has two or four values , respectively .",
    "the single - electron density matrix is @xmath33 where the transition density matrix between determinants @xmath34 and @xmath35 is defined by @xmath36 @xmath37 is the determinant of the @xmath38 overlap matrix @xmath39 = @xmath40 , and the @xmath41 and @xmath42 denote the single - electron functions used in constructing the basis functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "moreover , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the determinants of the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the one - electron wavefunctions @xmath47 and @xmath48 are obtained by self - consistently solving hartree - fock and sturmian equations for a nonrelativistic calculation and dirac - fock and sturmian equations for a relativistic calculation @xcite .",
    "transition dipole moments can be derived in a similar fashion by assuming different initial and final states in eq .",
    "[ dipole ] .",
    "the atomic determinants for the krb dimer are constructed from single - electron hartree - fock or dirac - fock functions / orbitals for electrons in closed and valence shells .",
    "sturmian wavefunctions complement the basis functions and are used to describe virtual orbitals .",
    "one - electron functions are characterized by a main quantum number @xmath49 and orbital angular momentum @xmath50 for both nonrelativistic and relativistic calculations .",

    "single electron excitations from the closed @xmath57 shell of k and @xmath58 shell of rb are allowed and introduce core - valence correlations in the ci .",
    "the @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 valence orbitals of k and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 orbitals of rb are allowed to contain at most two electrons .",
    "in addition , for the nonrelativistic calculation we allow at most two electrons in the @xmath64 , @xmath63 , and @xmath65 virtual orbitals of potassium and the @xmath66 , @xmath65 , and @xmath67 virtual orbitals of rubidium .",
    "for the relativistic calculation computational limitations restricted us to the @xmath64 and @xmath63 virtual orbitals of k and @xmath66 and @xmath65 virtual orbitals of rb . both covalent and ionic configurations",
    "are constructed .",
    "the ci expansions with these basis sets have 493 nonrelativistic and 1459 relativistic configurations .",
    "the ground state potentials have equilibrium distances @xmath68 and dissociation energies @xmath69 that agree with experimental rkr values @xcite and other theoretical potentials .",

    "the experimentally determined dissociation energy for the @xmath6 potential @xcite is 26 @xmath72 smaller than ours .",
    "we performed calculations of the @xmath6 and @xmath2 state potentials and their permanent dipole moments in both nonrelativistic and relativistic approximation .",
    "for the same set of one - electron orbitals the influence of relativistic effects on the potential energy is very small whereas its influence on the dipole moments is large . at @xmath68",
    "a relativistic calculation leads to a 30% increase in the absolute value of the dipole moment for the @xmath0 state and a 50% decrease for the @xmath2 state .",
    "moreover , we find large correlation effects in the electric dipole moment in both nonrelativistic and relativistic calculations . the implementation of core polarization , for instance , leads a 50% of reduction in the absolute value of the dipole moment at the bottom of the singlet potential .",
    "figures [ 1s_dipole ] and [ 3s_dipole ] show the electric dipole moments of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 potentials of krb as a function of internuclear separation , respectively .",
    "a negative dipole moment implies an excess electron charge on the potassium atom .",
    "the presented dipole moments are calculated with the relativistic and nonrelativistic hamiltonian .",
    "curve 1 in figs .",
    "[ 1s_dipole ] and [ 3s_dipole ] is determined from the most accurate nonrelativistic calculation , which includes the two - electron occupation of all orbitals upto @xmath65 for the k atom and @xmath67 or the rb atom .",
    "curve 2 in figs .",
    "[ 1s_dipole ] and [ 3s_dipole ] shows the @xmath73 relativistic calculation . the number of excited orbitals is smaller than in the nonrelativistic basis set and limited to excitations upto @xmath64 and @xmath63 for k atom and @xmath66 and @xmath65 for rb atom .",
    "the difference between the dipole moments of the @xmath73 and 1 component of the @xmath2 potential is much smaller than the uncertainties of our calculations .",
    "tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] tabulate the permanent dipole moment of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 potentials shown in the figures .",
    "our calculation shows that the distribution of the charge density between k and rb is very diffuse .",
    "it means that the dipole moment depends not only on the electron charge transfer from rb to k atom but also on the induced polarization from the charge transfer , i.e. the electrons occupy excited @xmath74 and @xmath75 orbitals .",
    "charge transfer and the induced polarization are of opposite sign .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath76 state .",
    "we find that the excess charge is almost equal for the singlet and triplet states , but the latter has a smaller dipole moment .",
    "the permanent dipole moments of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 state multiplied by @xmath77 , based on a the relativistic calculation are shown in fig .",
    "it shows that the long - range behavior of the dipole moment of the two states are equal and proportional to @xmath78 .",
    "this long - range behavior is due to the modification of the molecular wave function by the dipole - dipole and dipole - quadrupole multipole interactions @xcite .",
    "we believe that our convergence with respect to correlation or the number of basis function is of the same order as the difference between nonrelativistic and relativistic calculation .",
    "consequently , we feel that the most accurate dipole moment is obtained from averaging the nonrelativistic and relativistic calculation and assuming an one - standard deviation uncertainty equal to half the difference between the two calculations . for the @xmath0 state",
    "the dipole moment is @xmath790.30(2 ) @xmath1 at @xmath80 @xmath81 , while for the @xmath2 state the dipole moment is @xmath790.02(1 ) @xmath1 at @xmath68=11.2 @xmath81 .",
    "in this section we analyze the possibility of the creation of dipolar krb molecules in an optical lattice .",
    "we assume that colliding atoms are initially in the doubly spin - polarized state , which only allow them to come together on the state @xmath7 potential .",
    "thus photoassociation via an excited molecular @xmath82 or @xmath83 state produces @xmath7 molecular levels . in principle",
    "this makes the production of molecules in the @xmath6 state problematical , since one has to get from the triplet to singlet spin manifold .",
    "there is , however , a viable route from the doubly spin - polarized colliding ground state atoms to ground @xmath84 levels via the excited state . when the detuning of the photoassociation laser from atomic resonance is small compared to the excited state spin - orbit splitting , as will be the case for most practical photoassociation schemes , then an excited @xmath10 = 0 or 1 hund s case ( c ) state can have both singlet and triplet character .",
    "thus , an excited molecular state can be formed from excitation from a @xmath7 state that can re - emit light in a transition to a @xmath6 state .",
    "this process is absent in homonuclear dimers , since the additional gerade- ungerade selection rule for electronic transitions prevents it .",
    "figure  [ excpot ] shows the @xmath85 and @xmath86 relativistic excited state potentials as a function of internuclear separation .",
    "the excited state potentials are obtained with the basis described in sec .",
    "[ gs ] . at short internuclear separation",
    "the potentials are described by the @xmath87 hund s case ( a ) labeling following ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath88 is a projection of the electronic orbital angular momentum on the molecular axis and @xmath89 is the total electron spin . at longer @xmath5 the curves",
    "are better described by @xmath90 hund s case ( c ) labeling and relativistic effects are important .",
    "the potentials dissociate to the excited k(4s)+rb(5p @xmath91 ) and k(4p @xmath91 ) + rb(5s ) fine structure limits .",
    "the two lowest dissociation limits correspond to the two fine structure states of the excited rb atom plus a ground state k atom .",
    "the long - range behavior of the relativistic potentials dissociating to these two limits is attractive .",
    "there are seven attractive potentials with @xmath73 and @xmath86 .",
    "our potentials agree with the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the attractive excited - state potentials are the most likely candidates for use in two - color raman photoassociation experiments .",
    "we calculate transition dipole moments relevant for transitions from the @xmath92 state , through the attractive @xmath85 and 1 potentials , to the @xmath93 state .",
    "figures  [ 3s_trans ] and [ 1s_trans ] show the nonzero transition dipole moments from the @xmath2 and @xmath0 states , respectively .",
    "curves with the same style in the two figures indicate the same intermediate excited state .",
    "photon selection rules ensure that @xmath94 @xmath95 @xmath96 transition are not allowed . at long - range",
    "the transition dipole moments become independent of @xmath5 and their absolute values approach the rb 5s @xmath95 5p(@xmath97 ) transition dipole moment when the corresponding excited potential dissociates to the k(4s)+rb(5p @xmath91 ) limit .    at short - range internuclear separation",
    "the dipole moments strongly depend on @xmath5 .",
    "this behavior reflects the change from a hund s case ( a ) to a relativistic coupling scheme between 20 @xmath81 and 30 @xmath81 . in fig .",
    "[ 3s_trans ] the @xmath98 to @xmath99 and in fig .",
    "[ 1s_trans ] the @xmath93 to @xmath100 transition dipole moments approach zero at short @xmath5 because singlet to triplet transitions are not allowed . in fig .",
    "[ 3s_trans ] both @xmath101 to @xmath100 and @xmath102 to @xmath100 have a small dipole moment at small internuclear separation .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the structure of the ground and excited state potentials shown in figs .",
    "[ potentials ] and [ excpot ] is similar to that of homonuclear alkali - metal dimers , where gerade / ungerade symmetry is valid . in homonuclear dimers electric dipole transitions between gerade and ungerade states",
    "are forbidden .    the sudden change in dipole moment in fig .",
    "[ 1s_trans ] near 13 @xmath81 is related to the avoided crossing indicated by the circle in fig .",

    "we estimate that the uncertainty of the transition dipole moments is 0.1 @xmath1 based on a comparison of the calculated dipole moments at @xmath106 with the known 5s to 5p dipole moments of rb@xcite .",
    "we determined the permanent dipole moments of the @xmath4 states of the ground configuration of the krb heteronuclear molecule using a nonrelativistic and relativistic ci valence bond method .",
    "the krb permanent dipole moments are small compared to `` truly '' polar molecules , such as nacl .",
    "it might , however , be large enough for experiments that aim to confine krb in optical traps .",
    "in addition we calculated the potential energy curves and transition dipole moments to excited states correlating to k(4s)+rb(5p ) atomic limits .",
    "we have shown that there exist allowed transitions starting from colliding doubly polarized k and rb atoms via an exited state to the singlet x@xmath107 state .",
    "the calculation of the electric dipole moments is a first step towards obtaining quantitative estimates of photoabsorption and molecular production rates in a gas of k and rb atoms . in the future we plan to evaluate frank - condon factors between vibrational levels of ground and excited state potentials .",
