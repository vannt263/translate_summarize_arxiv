    "the two sources considered in this paper belong to a small group of x - ray pulsars which are called anomalous x - ray pulsars ( hereafter axps ) , with periods in the @xmath0512 s range .",
    "this narrow pulse period distribution of the axps , is significantly different from that of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrbs ) where the pulse periods span a range from 69 ms to 25 min .",
    "their x - ray spectra have steep power law indices @xmath0 3 - 4 in addition to soft blackbody components with kt@xmath00.5 kev in some of the sources ( stella et al . ,",
    "they lack observed optical counterparts .",
    "their x - ray luminosities are at the order of 10@xmath3 - 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 and spin down rates are relatively constant .",
    "the first proposed model for axps was accretion from low - mass x - ray companions at lower accretion rates ( l@xmath6erg s@xmath5 ) with magnetic fields of b@xmath7 gauss ( mereghetti @xmath2 stella 1995 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the observed pulse periods of axps can be explained as rotation periods of neutron stars close to the equilibrium periods for accretion from a disk .",
    "however , orbital signatures such as periodic delays in pulse arrival times or periodic flux changes have not been observed in the axps . this has led several researchers to alternative interpretations based on the single pulsar hypothesis .",
    "corbet et al . ( 1995 ) suggested the possibility of accretion from a molecular cloud .",
    "alternatively , axps could be isolated stars which are accreting from a disk formed as remnants of the common envelope evolution of hmxrbs ( van paradijs et al . 1995 , ghosh et al . 1997 ) .",
    "on the other hand thompson @xmath2 duncan ( 1993 ) proposed that these sources are highly magnetized ( @xmath010@xmath8-@xmath9 gauss ) isolated neutron stars ( magnetars ) which are slowing down due to electromagnetic dipole radiation . according to the magnetar theory",
    "there should be several unseen very large glitches in pulse period histories of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 and 1e 2259 + 586 ( heyl @xmath2 hernquist 1999 ) .",
    "these glitches should be at least a factor of hundred larger than the radio pulsar glitches in @xmath10 ( thompson @xmath2 duncan 1996 , heyl @xmath2 hernquist 1999 ) .",
    "1e 1048.1 - 5937 was discovered by the einstein satellite during the observations of the carina nebula ( seward , charles @xmath2 smale 1986 ) .",
    "1e 2259 + 586 is located at the center of the radio / x - ray supernova remnant g109.1 - 1.0 ( fahlman & gregory 1981 ) .",
    "both sources lack bright optical counterparts ( mereghetti , caraveo @xmath2 bignami 1992 , coe @xmath2 jones 1992 ) .",
    "if they are binary systems , their companion stars should be either white dwarfs or helium - burning stars with m@xmath110.8m@xmath12 ( mereghetti , israel , stella , 1998 , baykal et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the torque changes of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 and 1e 2259 + 586 were studied by mereghetti ( 1995 ) , corbet @xmath2 mihara ( 1997 ) and baykal @xmath2 swank ( 1996 ) .",
    "both sources showed pulse frequency changes which can support the accretion hypothesis . in this work ,",
    "we present two new pulse frequency measurements from long observations in the archival rxte data base . in the @xmath0400 day time span of the observation",
    ", we found the spin - down rate of 1e  1048.15937 to change by 30 % .",
    "recent pulse timing analysis of 1e  2259 + 586 ( kaspi et al . , 1999 ) has shown that the source had constant spin down over a 2.6 yr time span , with very low timing noise .",
    "we extracted archival data of 1e 2259 + 586 and constructed a bolometric x - ray luminosity time series .",
    "we found that the x - ray luminosity is almost constant while the spin - down rate is constant ( kaspi et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the archival observations of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 and 1e 2259 + 586 are listed in table 1 . the results presented here",
    "are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters operating in the 2 - 60 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath13 and a field of view of @xmath14 fwhm .",
    "background light curves and the pulse height amplitudes were generated using the background estimator models based on the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission with the standard pca analysis tools ( ftools ) and were subtracted from the source light curve obtained from the first good xenon layer of event data .",
    "the background subtracted light curves were corrected with respect to the barycenter of the solar system . from the long archival data string , pulse periods for 1e 1048.1 - 5937 were found by folding the time series on statistically independent trial periods ( leahy et al .",
    "master pulses were constructed from these observations by folding the data on the period giving the maximum @xmath15 .",
    "the master pulses were arranged in 55 phase bins and represented by their fourier harmonics ( deeter & boynton 1985 ) and cross - correlated with the harmonic representation of average pulse profiles from each observation .",
    "the pulse arrival times are obtained from the cross - correlation analysis .",
    "the linear trend of pulse arrival times is a direct measure of the pulse frequency during the observation , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis , @xmath18 is the mid - time of the observation , @xmath19 is the phase offset at t@xmath12 , @xmath20 is the deviation from the mean pulse frequency ( or additive correction to the pulse frequency ) .",
    "the pulse period measurments of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 from archival rxte observations are presented in table 2 .    during the rxte observations the pulse frequency derivative of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 decreased approximately by 30 % ( see table 2 ) .",
    "however these changes can not be correlated with x - ray flux changes since eta carinae lies 45 a way from 1e 1048.1 - 5937 .",
    "the strong flux changes of eta carinae ( corcoran et al . , 1997 ) contaminate the fov of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 since the fwhm of rxte / pca @xmath14 .",
    "it should also be pointed out that in the archival rxte observations , there are found short , @xmath0 2000 sec , observations separated by months ; due to the pulse frequency derivative changes we have not phase connected them in order to avoid any cycle count ambiguity .",
    "similarly , two successive ginga observations of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 which were separated by 10 days can not be combined in phase because of the cycle count ambiguity ( corbet @xmath2 day 1990 ) .",
    "einstein , exosat and ginga observations of 1e 1048.15937 provided 5 pulse frequency measurements over 10 years , which were consistent with a constant spin - down rate of @xmath21 hz s@xmath5 ( mereghetti 1995 ) .",
    "this is @xmath2238 times higher than that of 1e 2259 + 586 ( baykal et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "observations with rosat in 1992 - 1993 indicated that the spin down rate almost doubled from its value in 1988 ( mereghetti 1995 ) .",
    "the mean flux decreased by a factor of 3 compared to the value measured with exosat in mid of @xmath0 1985 ( corbet @xmath2 mihara 1997 ) .",
    "these variations are consistent with accretion - powered x - ray emission .    in order to deduce the pulse frequency changes of 1e 1048.1 - 5937",
    ", the residuals of pulse frequencies are extracted from their linear trends and the residuals are presented in terms of their sigma values .",
    "1 ( lower ) clearly shows that the pulse frequency fluctuations are significant at the order of several @xmath23 levels .",
    "the residual pulse frequencies between @xmath0 48600  mjd @xmath0 50800 mjd yield a noise strength on the order of @xmath24 rad@xmath25 sec@xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the normalized variances of residual pulse frequencies and pulse arrival times and @xmath29 is the total time span ( see cordes 1980 for further definitions of noise strength ) .",
    "this value is comparable with typical accretion powered pulsar noise strength baykal @xmath2 gelman ( 1993 ) .",
    "recent rxte observations of 1e 2259 + 586 have shown a constant spin down rate with a low upper limit on timing noise ( kaspi et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "the residuals of the pulse arrival times gives an upper limit to the noise strength at @xmath30 years , s@xmath31 rad@xmath25 sec@xmath26 .",
    "this value is 5 decades lower than the value which is deduced from 15 years of pulse period history of 1e 2259 + 586 ( baykal @xmath2 swank 1996 , baykal @xmath2 gelman 1993 ) and 2 orders lower than that of the crab pulsar ( boynton et al . , 1972 ) or that of the lmxrb pulsar 4u 1626 - 67 ( chakrabarty 1997 ) .",
    "this upper limit is indeed very low for an accretion - powered x - ray pulsar .",
    "if the pulse period changes are due to variations in the accretion process , the x - ray luminosity would be a constant ( ghosh @xmath2 lamb 1979 ) . in order to check the variations in its x - ray luminosity , we derived the x - ray luminosities for all observations from the x - ray spectra .",
    "the x - ray background spectrum was calculated using the background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission as used to calculate background light curves .",
    "the x - ray spectra are fitted with a power law spectrum with a photon index 4.78 and column density n@xmath32=(2.2@xmath33 0.8)@xmath34 10@xmath35 @xmath36 , parameters consistent with those obtained from asca and sax measurements in the 2 - 10 kev range ( corbet et al . , 1995 , parmar et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the resultant background subtracted x - ray luminosity time series in the energy range 2 - 10 kev is presented in fig .",
    "2 . the variation in the bolometric x - ray luminosity is less than @xmath37 .",
    "this is consistent with low timing noise and secular spin down according to accretion models .    in ginga observations",
    "1e  2259 + 586 had flux levels a factor of two higher than average ( iwasawa et al .",
    "this implied that , if due to accretion , the rate onto the source was variable and fluctuations in the spin down rate would be expected .",
    "indeed for this era high noise levels @xmath38rad@xmath25sec@xmath26 are found ( baykal @xmath2 swank 1996 ) .",
    "in the pulse timing analysis of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 , we found pulse frequency changes on the time scale of 400 days .",
    "the source spin down rate has doubled since 1992 ( mereghetti 1995 , corbet @xmath2 mihara 1997 ) .",
    "the pulse frequency measurements since 1992 show significant fluctuations from the average spin down trend .",
    "the level of pulse frequency fluctuations of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 are found to be consistent with typical noise levels of accretion powered pulsars ( baykal @xmath2 gelman 1993 ) .",
    "two soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgr ) sgr 1806 - 20 , sgr 1900 + 14 were recently identified as magnetars ( kouveliotou et al . 1998 ; 1999 ) .",
    "the similarity of sgr and axp pulse periods and secular spin down trends raised the question whether all axps are actually magnetars . according to the magnetar theory pulse frequency fluctuations",
    "may be caused by processes such as : variable emission of alfven waves or particles from magnetars ( thompson @xmath2 blaes 1998 ) , radiative precession of magnetars ( melatos 1999 ) , or discontinous spin up events ( glitches ) like those seen in radio pulsars ( thompson @xmath2 duncan 1996 , see also kaspi et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "heyl @xmath2 hernquist ( 1999 ) investigated the pulse frequency histories of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 and 1e 2259 + 586 and proposed that the irregularities of these sources are explained by several large glitches with sizes @xmath39 s@xmath5 and @xmath40 s@xmath5 , respectively . while the values of @xmath20 are only about 20 times those of the vela and crab pulsars , respectively , the values of @xmath41 are several orders of magnitude larger than radio pulsar glitches and they occur much more frequently than scaling from the statistics of large radio pulsar glitches would lead us to expect ( alpar @xmath2 baykal 1994 ) .    in summary ,",
    "both sources have shown pulse frequency fluctuations on the order of a few decades ( mereghetti 1995 , baykal @xmath2 swank 1996 ) .",
    "the level of torque changes of 1e 2259 + 586 over a time scale of 15 years is consistent with accretion - powered x - ray binaries ( baykal @xmath2 swank 1996 ) .",
    "the steady level of the bolometric x - ray luminosity during the quiet spin down epoch ( kaspi et al . , 1999 ) is consistent with accretion models .",
    "alternatively it may turn out to be made out of discrete glitches over a background of relatively quiet spin down , as in isolated pulsars and magnetars ( heyl @xmath2 hernquist 1999 ) .",
    "continued phase coherent x - ray timing of this source should prove extremely important in finally deciding its nature .",
    "the correlation of the spin - down rate of 1e 1048.1 - 5937 with the x - ray flux supports the possibility that it is an accreting source ( mereghetti 1995 , corbet @xmath2 mihara 1997 ) .",
    "our work indicates that the source has high timing noise . to see the exact nature of correlations between x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivatives ,",
    "an even more extensive broad band x - ray observation should be carried out .",

    "the solid lines ( upper panel ) are fits to the measurements before and after sep 1988 , respectively .",
    "residuals from these linear trends are shown in terms of sigma values ( lower panel ) .",
    "measurements with einstein , exosat , and ginga ( x ) fit a trend well , while the later measurements with rosat and asca ( open circles ) and rxte ( filled circles ) fit a trend of higher spin - down , but with well measured deviations ."
