    "assuming the four color theorem ( 4ct ) it is easy to show that every cubic ( bridgeless ) planar graph has a three - edge - coloring since tait found an equivalent formulation of the 4ct in terms of 3-edge - coloring .. this is an old - conjecture due to tait in the squeal of  efforts in settling the four - color conjecture at the end of the 19th century . in this paper",
    "we have given an independent proof of this famous conjecture .",
    "again as we have recently introduced the new concept `` spiral chains '' in maximal planar graphs in the new non - computer proof of the four color theorem , we continue the use of spiral chains in the cubic plane graph for its three - edge - coloring [ 15 ] .",
    "note that there are other equivalent formulation of 4ct in terms of three edge - coloring of the pairs of binary trees [ 4].[5 ] .",
    "we have first shown that any cubic planar graph can be decomposed into vertex disjoint spiral chains which in turn expressed as the union of _ folded _ special spiral caterpillar ( spiral - combs ) . then based on the spiral - comb(s ) decomposition",
    "we have provided a simple three - edge - coloring algorithm for any given cubic planar graph . in the second part of the paper we will show that the same method can also be applied to a similar but more general three - edge cubic graph ( non - planar ) coloring conjecture of tutte which has been recently settled by a series lengthy papers using the classical four color theorem proof technique .",
    "that is    every @xmath0-connected cubic graph with no petersen minor is 3-edge colorable .",
    "this extends the four color theorem as tait showed that the four color theorem is equivalent to the statement that every planar @xmath0-connected cubic graph is @xmath1-edge colorable .",
    "it also implies that certain non - planar graphs are 3-edge colorable .",
    "let us say that g is _ apex _ if @xmath2 is planar for some @xmath3 and @xmath4 is _ doublecross _ if it can be drawn in the plane with crossings , but with atmost two crossings and with all the crossings on the boundary of the finite region .",
    "both apex and doublecross graphs have no petersen minor so tutte s conjecture implies :    ( rst ) ( 1 ) every 2-connected apex cubic graph is 3-edge colorable and ( 2 ) every 2-connected doublecross cubic graph is 3-edge colorable .    the above conjecture is the outcome of joint efforts of robertson , seymour and thomas ( rst ) [ 6,7,8 ] and it appears that excluding roberstson , sanders joins in the team for edge 3-coloring of cubic apex and doublecross graphs [ 9,10 ] .",
    "tutte and rst equivalences has been shown in [ 6 ] that `` a minimum counter - example '' mean a 2-connected cubic graph @xmath4 with no petersen minor which is not @xmath1-edge colorable , with @xmath5 minimum .",
    "that is every minimum counter - example is either apex or doublecross .",
    "eventually tutte s conjecture has been settled by a series of papers [ 6]-[10 ] by using the classical proof method of the four color theorem [ 12],[13],[14 ] .",
    "the concept of spiral chain has been introduced by the author for an non - computer proof of the four - color theorem in 2004 [ 15 ] .",
    "we have applied spiral - chain coloring technique to the maximal planar graphs and we will use it the same for cubic planar and almost planar ( apex and doublecross ) cubic graphs .",
    "therefore the main aim of this paper is to give an independent proof of the famous tait s conjecture for bridgeless cubic planar graphs by using spiral - chain edge - coloring and then to show that it would be possible to extend it to the proof of conjecture rst .",
    "hence to the proof of conjecture 1 .    ....    ....",
    "throughout the paper the numbers @xmath6 attached on the edges of a graph correspond , respectively to the colors ( r)ed , ( o)range and ( g)reen . that is @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a @xmath0-connected ( bridgeless ) cubic planar graph drawn in the plane without crossings .",
    "let @xmath9 be denote its outer - boundary cycle consist of vertices @xmath10 .",
    "without loss of generality select the edges starting from vertex @xmath11ends at vertex @xmath12 in the clockwise - direction ( or anti - clockwise - direction ) in the plane .",
    "that is we have selected the path from vertex @xmath11 to @xmath12 on the @xmath9 .",
    "we can do this always by selecting unused right - most edge in the plane , that is if the vertex @xmath13 is in the spiral @xmath14 then @xmath15 will be in the @xmath14 only if @xmath16 is the right - most edge incident at @xmath13 .",
    "delete these selected vertices @xmath17 from the boundary cycle of @xmath18 and obtain the subgraph @xmath19 note that we have not selected the edge @xmath20 since @xmath21 is the outer - boundary cycle of @xmath22 . then continue in this way for the other ( inner ) vertices on the outer - boundary vertices of the subgraph @xmath23 that is select the edge @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the outer - boundary vertices @xmath27 of @xmath28 in the clockwise direction and delete them form @xmath28 and the repeat the same process for @xmath29",
    "let us assume that repeatation of this spirally selection of the vertices results an empty graph at stage @xmath30 .",
    "now union of deleted vertices of @xmath31 forum the spiral - chain @xmath14 of @xmath32we may describe spiral - chain @xmath14 in terms of consecutive edges between the deleted edges as @xmath33where @xmath34 @xmath35 is the edge connecting two spiral segments of @xmath22 and @xmath28 .",
    "not all @xmath36-connected cubic planar graphs are hamiltonian , see for example famous tutte graph in fig.2 .",
    "otherwise the proof of tait s conjecture would be immediately obtained by coloring hamiltonian cycle with colors 1 and 2 and coloring other edges with color 3 . but deciding whether a cubic planar graph has an hamiltonian cycle or not is not an easy task .",
    "therefore on tait coloring of cubic planar graphs hamiltonicity is not our primary concern . on the other hand",
    "a @xmath0-connected cubic planar graph may have a hamiltonian cycle but have several spiral chains ( see fig . 1 and 5 ) .",
    "edge coloring of these figures will be explained later .",
    "let @xmath37 be tree with @xmath38 vertices .",
    "base tree @xmath39 of @xmath37 is obtained by removing end - vertices of @xmath37 .",
    "a tree @xmath37 is called _ _",
    "caterpilla__r if its base tree is a path .",
    "we will use in our spiral - chain edge - coloring a special caterpillar called comb - tree :    comb tree @xmath40 is a caterpillar in which all vertex degrees are @xmath41 or @xmath42    we will be investigating 3-edge coloring of @xmath0-connected cubic planar graphs under two classes of cubic planar graphs since the `` triangles '' ( cycle of length three ) are the main issue in the uniqueness of the three colorings in planar graphs .",
    "for example t. fowler and r. thomas have settled a conjecture of fiorini and wilson , and fisk about uniquely colorable planar graphs e.g. ,    a 3-regular planar graph has a unique edge 3-coloring if and only it can be obtained from the complete graph on four vertices by repeatedly replacing vertices by triangles .",
    "we will return to the uniquely edge 3-coloring planar graphs from the point - view of spiral - chain coloring .",
    "let us start with a result on three edge - coloring of cubic planar graphs with triangles .",
    "three edge - coloring of a cubic planar graph @xmath43 with triangles can be obtained from three edge - coloring of a triangle - free cubic bridgeless planar graph @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath43 be denote a cubic ( bridgeless ) planar graph .",
    "then @xmath44 can only contains ( a ) vertex disjoint triangles , ( b ) two triangles with only one edge common , call it _ twin - triangle _ and ( c ) if it contains three mutually adjacent triangles then @xmath45assume that all triangle - free cubic planar graphs have been three edge - colored .",
    "consider any cubic graph @xmath43 which contains an triangle @xmath46 without an common edge with another triangle .",
    "that is let @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath43 must have also vertices @xmath49 such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be the set of the three colors , i.e. , @xmath53 . in any proper edge - coloring of @xmath43 the subgraph formed by the triangle",
    "@xmath54 together with the edges @xmath55 must have an unique edge - coloring as shown in fig .",
    "since the colors of the edges @xmath56 are @xmath57 we can shrink the triangle @xmath46 into a vertex @xmath58 and obtain a new cubic graph ( see also fig .",
    "we repeat this process for every triangle till we arrive to a cubic - graph without distinct triangles .",
    "order the new vertices so created as @xmath59 if @xmath44contains twin - triangle then it must have vertices @xmath60 and edges @xmath61 and two more edges @xmath62 and @xmath63 to make vertex degrees of the twin - triangle all three .",
    "now all possible three edge - coloring of the subgraph has been shown in fig .",
    "note that we have @xmath64 otherwise it implies a bridge in @xmath43 . since the color of the edges @xmath62 and @xmath63 is @xmath65",
    "we delete the twin - triangle from @xmath43 and join @xmath66 and @xmath67 with an new edge @xmath68to obtain another possibly triangle free cubic planar graph . if not we repeat the above processes for each twin - triangles in @xmath43 till we get an triangle - free cubic planar graph @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath69 be set of new edges inserted during the deletion of twin - triangles . since we have assumed that @xmath4 is a three edge - colorable we start from a coloring of @xmath4 and re - insert all the deleted triangles for each @xmath70 and twin - triangles for each @xmath71 back into @xmath4 but this time with suitable edge - colors based on the coloring of @xmath4 and the cases in fig .",
    "hence we have obtained three edge - coloring of @xmath43 . note that @xmath72 is an isolate case and is shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) .",
    "characterization of uniquely 3-edge colorable graphs have been given by towler and thomas . since these cubic planar graphs can only be obtained from the complete graph on four vertices by repeatedly replacing vertices by triangles , we note that they are hamiltonian and admit a very simple unique @xmath73edge coloring e.g. , consider the coloring of fig .",
    "let @xmath74 be an uniquely 3-edge colorable graph .",
    "let the vertices @xmath75 induce an triangle in @xmath74 and let @xmath76 .",
    "we say the edge colors of  an triangle is positive `` + '' if the colors of the edges @xmath77 respectively are @xmath78 and negative `` - '' if the colors of its edges respectively are @xmath79 .",
    "that is in a positively signed triangle , numbers corresponding colors are rotated in clockwise direction while negatively signed triangle numbers are rotated in anti - clockwise direction ( see fig .",
    "we also say that a vertex @xmath3 in @xmath80 is mature if it is on the corner of an triangle otherwise we call immature vertex .",
    "if all vertices of @xmath74 are mature we say the graph is complete and denote it by @xmath81 i.e. , complete with respect to the number of triangles@xmath82 for example the cubic graph shown in fig .",
    "5 is a complete graph on six triangles .",
    "some properties of @xmath74 are :    - except @xmath72 ( complete graph with four vertices ) , for any cubic graph @xmath80 no two triangles have a common edge",
    ".    -  let @xmath14 be a spiral - chain in @xmath83 for an 3-edge coloring of @xmath74 the sign of all triangles incident to outer - boundary cycle have the same polarity , say all are + . furthermore",
    "because of the character of the construction of uniquely 3-edge colorable graphs they constitute shell - structure ( known also anti - matroids ) of triangles in the graph and triangles in the consecutive shells must be labeled with opposite signs . for example in fig .",
    "5 all triangles labeled with positive signs are the triangles in the outer shell and neighbor shell triangles are labeled with negative signs . since spiral - chains are shelling structure [ 15 ] , we can use this property when we color the edges of @xmath74 .",
    "that is we can extract the sign of the triangle from the knowledge of the location of the edge in the spiral chain and from the sign of the previous triangle when we meet one along the edges of the spiral chain .",
    "we omit details of the spiral - chain coloring algorithm for 3-edge uniquely colorable graphs since the algorithm given in the next section may as well be applied for this class of cubic planar graphs .      in this section",
    "we will give an three edge - coloring algorithm which uses spiral chains of the given cubic bridgeless planar graph .",
    "let @xmath84 in the figures we use numbers@xmath6 on the edges instead of letters to avoid confusion .",
    "let @xmath14 be denote a spiral - chain of @xmath4 .",
    "as we go through the vertices of @xmath14 we construct a path @xmath85 with vertices @xmath86 and assume that @xmath87i.e .",
    ", @xmath88 we will investigate cubic graphs with several spiral - chains later .",
    "edges incident to @xmath85 together with the edges @xmath89 of the path constitute a comb - caterpillar tree @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "an edge @xmath96 of the @xmath97 is called the _",
    "backbone_-edge if @xmath98 and is called the _ hair_-edge @xmath99 if @xmath100 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath101 but some of the edges of @xmath102 are counted twice since any hair - edge of @xmath97 has two ends in the spiral - chain @xmath103 again as we go through the edges of @xmath14 we call that hair edge @xmath104 is _ real _ if it is encountered for the first - time and _ imaginary _ if it is encountered for the second - time . in the figures all the real - hair edges have been shown in straight - lines while the imaginary - hair edges are shown with dashed - lines .",
    "the importance of the real and imaginary hairs will be clearer when deciding the color of the current edge in the spiral chain .",
    "we have classify the colors into two classes .",
    "the color green @xmath4 is called as the `` primary '' color while the colors orange @xmath105 and red @xmath106 are called the `` secondary '' colors . in the coloring algorithm given below primary color @xmath4 is used mostly for the spiral - chain backbone edges and the secondary colors @xmath105 and @xmath107 are used mostly for the hair - edges .",
