    "many symmetrical molecules exist in nature only in the form of nuclear spin isomers @xcite .",
    "these isomers differ by symmetry of nuclear spin wave function and , consequently , by symmetry of molecular spatial wave function .",
    "relaxation between different spin states ( spin conversion ) is extremely slow process if it is compared with other gas kinetic rates , e.g. , vibrational relaxation .",
    "it makes nuclear spin isomers unique objects with many potential applications .",
    "it was shown in a recent paper @xcite that external radiation can influence conversion of spin isomers both through level populations and through optically induced coherences .",
    "purpose of the paper @xcite was to investigate main features of the coherent control of isomer enrichment and conversion . in order to achieve the goal , the process was considered in a simplest arrangement in which microwave radiation excited molecular rotational transition .",
    "in the present paper we will consider the process in more complicated arrangement which promises significantly better control of spin conversion .",
    "one outcome of this high efficiency is that the coherent control in new arrangement can be used for detection of very weak ( @xmath0  hz ) interactions in molecules .",
    "first , we give qualitative picture of the process .",
    "let us assume that a test molecule has two nuclear spin states , ortho and para , and that there is a laser radiation resonant to the rovibrational transition , @xmath1 , in the ortho subspace , fig .",
    "the low state @xmath2 is not mixed with para states , but the upper state @xmath3 is mixed by the _ intramolecular _",
    "perturbation @xmath4 with the para state @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , there is the ortho - para level pair , @xmath6 , in the ground vibrational state mixed by another _ intramolecular _",
    "perturbation @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that collisions of the test molecules can not alter their spin state .",
    "this arrangement corresponds to the general formulation of _ quantum relaxation _ in which one has collisionally isolated subspaces of states mixed together by internal perturbation @xcite .",
    "suppose that the molecule is placed initially in the ortho subspace of the ground vibrational state .",
    "due to collisions the test molecule will undergo fast rotational relaxation _ inside _ the ortho subspace .",
    "this will proceed until molecule jumps to the state @xmath8 , which is directly mixed with the para state @xmath9 , or to the state @xmath2 which is mixed by combined action of the external field and intramolecular perturbation @xmath4 with the para state @xmath5 .",
    "admixture of a para state implies that the next collision can move the molecule to another para states and thus localize it inside the para subspace .",
    "it is clear that resonant radiation can significantly modify the spin conversion .",
    "one knows from the literature on resonant interaction of strong laser radiation with matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that radiation can change population of states , split states and create coherences in the system .",
    "all these can affect the mixing of ortho and para states and thus the spin conversion process .",

    "the data shown in this figure correspond to @xmath106  khz , and @xmath107  mhz .",
    "the peak at @xmath105 appears because the excitation probability , @xmath40 , has maximum at this frequency .",
    "amplitude of this peak is determined mainly by the rate @xmath108 .",
    "as @xmath44 grows , the amplitude of the peak  2 reaches the value @xmath109 which constitutes @xmath110 .",
    "the peak at @xmath105 in isomer enrichment was predicted in @xcite by considering only the level population effects .",
    "peak at @xmath111 appears because the ortho state @xmath69 crosses the para state @xmath71 at this frequency of the external field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this peak is determined mainly by @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath44 increases its amplitude grows to much bigger values than the amplitude of the peak at @xmath105 . at resonant frequency",
    "@xmath111 the rate @xmath81 is enhanced by large factor @xmath112 .",
    "this explains much larger enrichment at @xmath111 .",
    "note , that large enrichment occurs only if the excitation probability at this frequency , @xmath113 , is not very low .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] correspond to strong optical field , @xmath114  mhz , and three values of @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath116 was taken equal 2  mhz .",
    "one can see , that strong optical field is able to convert almost all molecules to the para state if @xmath117 .",
    "thus relatively weak ( 3  khz ) coupling in upper state is able to produce macroscopic effect , viz .",
    ", almost complete enrichment of spin isomers .",
    "it is of fundamental importance , that even for much weaker coupling in upper state , enrichment is still significant .",
    "for example , if the perturbation in upper state , @xmath118  hz , one has the enrichment , @xmath119% .",
    "enrichment at this level can easily be measured .",
    "it is important that the enrichment peak at @xmath111 is narrow ( the width @xmath120 ) and thus can be distinguished from much wider structures ( the width @xmath121 ) induced by population effects .",
    "equilibration rate in the system is given by @xmath85 , see eq .",
    "( [ overro ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to characterize the conversion rate in relative units , @xmath122 conversion rate , like enrichment , has two peaks in its frequency dependence at low @xmath44 .",
    "if rabi frequency , @xmath44 , is large and the ortho - para couplings in upper and low states have the same order of magnitude , conversion can be significantly enhanced ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "again , this enhancement appears because of the crossing of ortho and para states in upper vibrational state by external field .",
    "the phenomenon considered in the paper is based on the level splitting produced by resonant electromagnetic radiation .",
    "sometimes , this splitting is called in optics the dynamic stark effect .",
    "the essence of the effect can be understood as follows .",
    "mixing of ortho and para states depends on magnitude of the perturbation @xmath4 but also on the ortho - para level gap .",
    "optical field splits the molecular state and thus change the gaps between the ortho and para states .",
    "conversion rate is significantly enhanced when the ortho and para states cross .",
    "similar enhancement occurs when ortho and para states are crossed by ordinary stark effect in an external dc electric field @xcite .    in the same way",
    ", one can understand high sensitivity of the phenomenon to weak ortho - para couplings in excited state .",
    "equilibrium concentrations of ortho and para molecules are achieved when one has the ortho - to - para flux in excited state equal to the back flux in the ground vibrational state .",
    "back flux is slow because it is determined by the non - degenerate ortho - para level pair .",
    "on the other hand , the flux in excited state can be significantly enhanced by proper choice of radiation parameters which allows to cross the ortho and para states in upper vibrational state .",
    "high efficiency of the proposed enrichment method can be used to detect weak perturbations in excited vibrational state .",
    "first of all , it can be the hyperfine perturbations of the same origin and similar magnitude as the perturbations in the ground vibrational state .",
    "we have seen that hyperfine coupling of the order of @xmath123  hz is able to convert almost all molecules in one spin state .",
    "one can also detect much weaker interactions in molecules . in this case one should select the ortho - para level pair in excited vibrational state which is not mixed by `` ordinary '' hyperfine interactions in order to avoid the weak interaction to be hidden by stronger , ordinary hyperfine interactions . an interesting case is the crossings of states having opposite parity . mixing of such ortho and para states can be performed only by spin - dependent , parity - odd interactions which are not observed in molecules yet .",
    "we have performed analysis of the spin isomer enrichment and conversion governed by molecular rovibrational excitation .",
    "this analysis was done using a few simplifications .",
    "we have neglected the doppler broadening of the absorbing transition , degeneracy of molecular states , and resonant vibrational exchange between excited and unexcited molecules .",
    "these simplifications are not crucial for the existence of the phenomenon .",
    "more detailed analysis will be done elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that coherent control of nuclear spin conversion in molecules can be efficiently performed by strong radiation resonant to rovibrational molecular transition .",
    "a possible applications of this phenomenon is the enrichment of molecular spin isomers .",
    "another application is the detection of very weak ( @xmath0  hz ) interactions in molecules , which can be , e.g. , parity - odd interactions .",
