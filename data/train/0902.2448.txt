    "in the inflationary scenario , the primordial fluctuation comes from the quantum vacuum fluctuation of the inflaton which drive the inflation @xcite . then the quantum fluctuation becomes classical when the corresponding scale goes out of the horizon . the primordial fluctuation produced in this method is regarded to be gaussian random and scale invariant , which are confirmed by many astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "this explanation of the origin of the primordial fluctuation seems reasonable and successful .",
    "however it is not a rigorous theory and needs more experimental tests . besides the inflation , there exist other ideas to produce the primordial fluctuations , for example , the string gas model @xcite . even in the inflationary scenario , there are many kinds of modification to the primordial power spectrum , for example , the case that translational invariance is broken @xcite or rotational invariance is broken @xcite .",
    "the quantum - classical transition in the inflationary scenario is also criticized by @xcite .",
    "considering these uncertainties , our paper is motivated by checking one of the main features of the gaussian random fluctuation from the experiments : the different modes of the primordial fluctuation in the fourier space are independent from each other . as we know",
    ", the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is the relics of early universe , which can provide precise measurement on the primordial fluctuation .",
    "so in this paper we introduce a small correlation between different modes of the primordial fluctuation ( in fourier space ) and then study how the correlation affects the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the above mentioned correlations of the primordial fluctuation in fourier space . in section iii",
    "we calculate the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section iv and the discussions are given in section v.",
    "the meaning of the gaussian random primordial density fluctuation is @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the fourier mode of the primordial density fluctuation @xmath3 .",
    "the delta function indicates that different mode does not correlate with each other .",
    "one can relax this property by allowing different modes to correlate . generally speaking",
    ", one can rewrite the above equation as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is not required to be a delta function any more .",
    "however @xmath5 is not arbitrary , it must satisfy some constraints since @xmath3 is a real field .",
    "@xmath6 gives @xmath7 , which means the real part of @xmath5 is symmetric under the interchange of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the imaginary part of @xmath5 is antisymmetric under the interchange of @xmath8 , @xmath10 . besides this , @xmath11 , which indicates that @xmath12 .",
    "thus one obtains @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is such a special function with a zero imaginary part .",
    "however , these constraints provide no positive information on the function @xmath5",
    ". we must construct a concrete form of the above function .",
    "it is not strange to require that delta function is a good approximation to this function , and noting that when @xmath16 , @xmath17 } \\rightarrow \\delta ( x - y)$ ] , one can use a very simple form @xmath18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to replace the delta function .",
    "when @xmath19 , it approaches @xmath20 . here",
    "@xmath21 is a pure number and @xmath22 is the comoving wave number .",
    "this is a gaussian form function , which is completely determined by the parameter @xmath23 and its maximum is located at @xmath24 .",
    "the fwhm is @xmath25 .",
    "then in order to satisfy the above constraints , one can generalize @xmath26 to @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "their difference can be ignored in the weak correlation case ( @xmath29 is small ) , but can not be ignored in the strong correlation case ( @xmath29 is great ) . however",
    ", it is easy to note that the strong correlation case is excluded by the cmb observation , so in this paper we only take @xmath30 }   \\label{fkk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as an example to study the correlation effects on cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "in fact , the following discussions not only apply to primordial fluctuation with form ( [ fkk ] ) but also to such a form @xmath31 .",
    "it can be rewritten as @xmath32",
    "for scalar type of primordial density fluctuation , the cmb temperature anisotropy at direction @xmath33 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the transfer function , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the conformal time and @xmath38 is the conformal time of today . following the standard methods , the temperature anisotropy can be expanded by the spherical harmonic coefficients @xmath39 an important property of the modified primordial power spectrum @xmath40 is that the cmb anisotropy produced by such a form of primordial density fluctuation is statistically rotational invariant which means that for any rotation @xmath41 one always have @xmath42 the definite proof of eq.([rt ] ) is postponed to appendix . with this property ,",
    "one can obtain the following conclusion @xcite @xmath43 so the angular power spectrum @xmath44 is sufficient to reflect all the two point correlators of cmb anisotropy .",
    "the cmb angular power spectrum can be calculated by @xmath45 substituting eq.([talm ] ) into eq.([ctl ] ) , one obtains @xmath46 where the formula @xmath47 has been used and @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 where @xmath50 . in the appendix",
    "we have proved @xmath51 so , @xmath48 is only a function of @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 introducing new variables @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , one obtains @xmath56 where @xmath57 . since @xmath48 is only a function of @xmath58 , one can safely set @xmath59 in the @xmath60 direction @xmath61 , then @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 . noting that the integrand is only a function of @xmath65 , and using @xmath66 one obtains @xmath67 finally noting that the integrand is an even function of @xmath68 , one obtains a simple form , @xmath69 where @xmath50 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "in this paper we use the boltzmann code cmbfast ( @xcite ) to do numerical calculation and adopt a flat @xmath73 model with cosmological parameters : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . where @xmath81 is the optical depth , @xmath82 is spectral index and @xmath83 is the primordial scalar perturbation amplitude . in cmb power spectrum calculation",
    "@xmath84 is only a normalization factor , the value of which is determined by observational data .",
    "thus we can safely set it to be unit ( usually the value of @xmath84 is taken to be about @xmath85 ) , which will not affect the following discussion , since we mainly care about the relative change of the power spectrum .",
    "first we calculate @xmath86 for @xmath87 as a function of @xmath88 . when there is no correlation between the different modes , the cmb angular power spectrum is @xmath89 , which reduces to @xmath90 when the spectrum is scale invariant . from fig.([f1 ] ) it is easy to note that for different @xmath0 the main contribution to @xmath44 comes from different region of @xmath88 .",
    "the larger is @xmath0 , the main contributions to @xmath44 comes from larger @xmath88 .     on @xmath88 , from left to",
    "right these curves correspond to @xmath91 respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    then we plot @xmath92 for @xmath93 in their main region ( see fig.([f2],[f3],[f4 ] ) ) .",
    "one note that when @xmath94 @xmath95 is almost positive except for small @xmath88 where there exist a negative peak .",
    "one also note that for @xmath96 the average period is longer than that for @xmath97 .     on @xmath88.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     on @xmath88.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     on @xmath88.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the cmb angular power spectra are plotted in fig.([power ] ) and the relative angular power spectra changes and the relative cosmic variance are plotted in fig.([change ] ) .",
    "it is easy to note that the amplitude of angular power spectrum decreases when correlation is introduced .",
    "the greater is @xmath29 , the lower is the amplitude . from fig.([rt ] ) it can be seen that the angular power spectrum decreases more significantly at the neighborhood of @xmath97 than at smaller or larger @xmath0 .",
    "this is because of the phenomenon we mentioned in the last paragraph .",
    "numerical calculation tells us that the contribution of @xmath98 to @xmath44 ( eq.([cf ] ) ) concentrate at the neighbourhood of @xmath99 and @xmath100 in this case when @xmath29 is small ( so @xmath101 ) .",
    "thus one can simply consider such a quantity @xmath102 ( refer to eq.([fde ] ) ) and compare it with @xmath103 to understand the above mentioned phenomenon , where @xmath104 is a small fixed value . from fig.([f2],[f3],[f4 ] ) one know that @xmath95 oscillate with @xmath88 , so one can further consider such a function , @xmath105 the quantity @xmath106 , while another quantity @xmath107 ( here @xmath108 ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath109 . as the same reason , the angular power spectrum decrease when the primordial density fluctuation is correlated in fourier space . at the same time ,",
    "when @xmath110 , @xmath111 . due to this , for a fix @xmath104 , @xmath112 decrease less in the case that @xmath95 oscillates with a longer average period than the decrease in the case that @xmath95 oscillates with a shorter average period .",
    "thus the angular power spectrum at large @xmath0 decrease less than that at about @xmath113 , since @xmath114 oscillates with a shorter average period compared with @xmath115 .",
    "at last one note that when @xmath116 is always positive , the integrand @xmath117 is also positive , while when @xmath116 is positive and negative alternate , the integrand @xmath117 is not always positive .",
    "so when @xmath95 is always positive @xmath112 tends to decrease less than the case that @xmath95 takes positive value and negative value alternately .",
    "this is the reason that the angular power spectrum decrease less at small @xmath0 than that at @xmath97 .",
    "these features can be used to constrain the correlation strength parameter @xmath29 from the real data .     as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the gaussian random case , while the long dashed line , the short dashed line and the dotted line corresponds to @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]     on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath120 is defined as the cmb angular power spectrum with correlation minus the one without correlation .",
    "the solid line , long dashed line and short dashed line correspond to @xmath118 and @xmath119 respectively .",
    "the dotted line is the cosmic variance of the angular power spectrum @xmath121 in the uncorrelated case ( here @xmath122 is plotted).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "in this paper we only discussed a special type of the correlation of the primordial density fluctuation in the fourier space .",
    "there exist other forms of correlation . from the point of experimental view",
    ", the correlation discussed in our paper is typical because the correlation between two modes is large only when they are almost the same .",
    "however , it is possible that the correlation in the fourier space is scale dependent .",
    "such possibilities can not be excluded .",
    "a better method is to divide these possible forms into several types , and then consider their effects on cmb .",
    "besides cmb temperature , the effects on cmb polarization and large scale structure also need a further study .",
    "we would like to thank dr sun weimin for improving the manuscript .",
    "in this appendix we shall give a proof for the statistically rotational invariance of @xmath123 and rotational invariance of @xmath48 .    from eq.([talm ] ) , @xmath124 can be expressed as @xmath125 then the two point ensemble statistical average after rotation @xmath41 is @xmath126 replace the dummy variables @xmath127 by @xmath128 and note that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 and @xmath133 , one obtains @xmath134 since @xmath135 and @xmath136 , one finally obtain @xmath137 the same reasoning can be applied to @xmath48 . from eq.([fd ] ) , one obtains @xmath138 replace the dummy variables @xmath127 by @xmath128 as before and noted that @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 = \\dfrac{\\delta^{3 } ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^ { ' } - \\vec{\\delta})}{|r| } = \\delta^{3 } ( \\vec{k}-\\vec{k}^ { ' } - \\vec{\\delta})$ ] , one gets @xmath51 ."
