    "in many engineering and non - engineering applications , quantities of interest are time averages of some specific instantaneous output and this output may be affected by parameters of the physical system / model .",
    "for example , when evaluating the performance of a wing , the time averaged drag it produces is of great importance for aerodynamicists .",
    "any shape parameter of this wing ( width , lenght , curvature ... ) clearly has an impact on the produced drag and could be consequently considered a parameter of the system .",
    "computing the derivative of the quantity of interest ( time - averaged output ) with respect to the system s parameters is crucial in :    * * numerical optimization * : the derivative feeds a gradient - based algorithm which is then used to optimize the systems parameters * * uncertainty quantification * : the derivative itself gives a useful assessment of the sensitivity and/or uncertainty of the system with respect to its parameters    for chaotic systems such as those encountered in turbulent fluid flows , the so - called _ butterfly effect _ makes conventional tangent / adjoint algorithms fail when computing the derivative of the quantity of interest . indeed",
    ", the computed values are , in general , orders of magnitude bigger than the real one @xcite .",
    "some methods have been proposed to overcome this problem @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "_ least squares shadowing _ ( lss ) is a relatively simple and efficient algorithm that evaluates the desired derivative by solving a constrained least squares problem @xcite . in its actual version , corrective time dilation factors have to be introduced to ensure its convergence but these same terms",
    "lead to a heavier and more expensive system of equations to solve . in this paper , we introduce a modified version of lss in which the introduction of the time dilation factors is replaced by a simple _ windowing _ procedure : the result of the non corrected system of equations is multiplied by a specific windowing function .",
    "this procedure has been used for systems that have a periodic behavior @xcite , but we will show that the fundamental idea is still valid in our framework and can be transposed to chaotic dynamical systems . since this _",
    "`` windowing '' _ operation is almost costless , the new algorithm is more efficient than standard lss . + the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , we introduce the new algorithm in both its tangent and adjoint versions .",
    "then , in the second section , the underlying theory of the algorithm is presented and we prove that the result given by simplified lss converges to the one given by the original algorithm when integration time goes to infinity . finally , the last section is dedicated to a numerical application of the new algorithm using the lorenz @xmath0 test case dynamical system .",
    "consider a family of ergodic dynamical systems satisfying a differential equation parameterized by @xmath1 : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is smooth with respect to both @xmath4 and @xmath1 .",
    "ergodicity means that a long - time averaged quantity @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a measurable function and @xmath7 is a trajectory for parameter @xmath1 , does not depend on the initial condition of the trajectory @xmath8 .",
    "the derivative of such long - time averaged quantity can be approximated by the following three steps :    1 .",
    "integrate equation ( [ ode ] ) till the initial transient behavior has passed . then further integrate the equation over a period of @xmath9 , which should be multiple of the longest time scales in its solution . store the trajectory of the second time integration as @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   find a function @xmath11 with the least @xmath12 norm that satisfies the linearized equation @xmath13 where the time - dependent jacobians @xmath14 and @xmath15 are based on the trajectory obtained in the previous step .",
    "this @xmath16 can be found by solving a system of linear equations derived from the kkt conditions of the constrained least squares problem : @xmath17 note that this is the least squares shadowing problem in previous literature @xcite , but without a time - dilation term .",

    "this resulting derivative approximation converges to the true derivative as @xmath25 , as mathematically derived in section [ proof ] and under the same assumptions as the original least squares shadowing method @xcite .",
    "+ in the algorithm above , the cost of solving the constrained least squares problem ( [ kkttan ] ) scales with the dimension of @xmath1 , and is independent from the dimension of @xmath6 .",
    "such an algorithm , which favors a low - dimensional parameter @xmath1 and a high - dimensional quantity of interest @xmath6 , can be categorized as a tangent method in sensitivity analysis .",
    "a corresponding adjoint method can be derived , whose computation cost favors a high - dimensional @xmath1 and a low - dimensional @xmath6 .",

    "this system of linear differential equations is the dual of the system in step 2 of the previous algorithm , derived by combining it with equation ( [ objlsstan ] ) and integrating by parts .",
    "approximate the derivative of @xmath18 by the following equation , derived together with equations ( [ kktadj ] ) in step 2 : @xmath31    we can show that this adjoint algorithm produces a consistent approximation to that produced by the tangent algorithm .",

    "this error depends on the trajectory @xmath26 , but does not depend on whether the tangent or adjoint algorithm is used .",
    "throught out this paper , we mostly analyze the tangent algorithm , but the conclusions are also valid for the adjoint version since both algorithms approximate the derivative in a consistent way .",
    "the method introduced in this paper is similar to the original least squares shadowing method , except for two major differences .",
    "the first difference is the use of a smooth windowing function @xmath20 satisfying @xmath33 which averages to 1 and tapers off to 0 at both ends of the interval @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "the second difference is the lack of a time dilation term in equation ( [ kkttan ] ) ( equation ( [ kktadj ] ) for the adjoint version ) .",
    "removal of the time dilation term can simplify the implementation of a chaotic sensitivity analysis capability for many solvers .",
    "+ to understand the removal of the time dilation term , we should first understand the original least squares shadowing formulation @xcite , and why it has a time dilation term .",
    "the least squares shadowing method approximates the derivative of a long time average via an exchange of limit and derivative : @xmath34 as a sufficient condition for this exchange , we require the total derivative of @xmath6 with respect to @xmath1 , @xmath35 to be uniformly continuous . for this to hold , we ask for @xmath6 to have uniformly continuous partial derivatives , and @xmath36 to be uniformly bounded and continuous . among these conditions , it is most difficult to make @xmath36 uniformly bounded , when @xmath4 is governed by a family of chaotic dynamical systems .",

    "has to be slightly modified to : @xmath41 for some uniformly bounded scalar function of time @xmath42 , @xcite .",
    "the solution to this equation @xmath43 describes the difference between two solutions that satisfy the governing equation with both infinitesimally different parameter @xmath1 and infinitesimally different rate of time marching .",
    "specifically , if @xmath26 satisfies the equation @xmath44 then @xmath45 satisfies the equation @xmath46 the relative difference between the rates of time marching is quantified by @xmath42 .",
    "the shadowing lemma ensures that there exists a pair of @xmath43 and @xmath42 that are both uniformly bounded in time and satisfy equation ( [ linearizedeta ] ) .",

    ", we obtain : @xmath55 meaning that @xmath49 satisfies the simple no time - dilated equation ( [ linearizednoeta ] ) .",

    "+ note that lemma [ lem : win ] does not apply to the windowed average on the right hand side of equation ( [ limitderivwin ] ) in theorem 1 .",
    "this is because the lemma requires @xmath67 to be independent of the averaging length @xmath9 .",
    "but in theorem 1 , @xmath51 and thus @xmath75 depends on @xmath9 . to apply lemma [ lem : win ] , we must first decompose @xmath49 according to equation ( [ vv0 ] ) .",
    "lemma [ lem : win ] can then be applied to all but one of the components : @xmath76 if @xmath77 .",
    "here we used the fact that : @xmath78 we then apply integration by parts to the remaining windowed average , and use the assumption that @xmath22 in theorem 1 , to obtain : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the derivative of the window function @xmath20 . by substituting equation ( [ ibp ] ) into equation ( [ decomposevv ] ) , then comparing with equation ( [ limitderiv ] ) , we see that we can prove theorem 1 by proving the equality @xmath81 we now establish this equality , thereby proving theorem 1 , through two lemmas :    [ lemma3 ] if @xmath42 is bounded and @xmath82 exists , then @xmath83 }          \\left(\\tfrac{1}{t}\\left(\\textstyle\\int_{\\check{\\tau}}^t \\eta(\\tau ) d\\tau\\right ) -    \\langle\\eta\\rangle \\frac{t - \\check{\\tau}}{t}\\right)\\right ) = 0.\\ ] ]    the proof of this lemma is given in [ appendix2 ] .",

    "all windows respect the criteria of theorem 1 in exception of the square one which is equivalent to not using any window .",
    "the major difference between the last four functions is their taylor expansion in the neighborhood of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "actually , we can expect the areas around the extremities to be the most `` sensible '' ones , leading the the biggest error terms in the approximation of @xmath104 since @xmath49 is maximal in these areas .",
    "thus , choosing a windowing function that collapses quite fast on the extremities seems to be a good idea .",
    "the simple sine has non zero derivatives on the extremities , the squared one has a zero derivative on both sides , the hann - squared function has zero coefficients till the 3rd order derivative while the bump function has zero coefficients for all derivative orders . a deep and rigorous analysis of this intuitive idea has been carried out by krakos and al . for the periodic case ( periodic dynamical system)@xcite .",

    "the dynamical system is known to be quasi - hyperbolic and the analysis we carried out in the previous section remains valid .",
    "+ knowing that the analytical value of @xmath104 is around @xmath107 , we conclude that original lss as well as the windowed algorithms give consistent and very similar results except for the square window .",
    "this is quite reassuring since the square window is , de facto , not a valid windowing function ( @xmath126 ) and , above all , it confirms that the other windows are efficiently `` correcting '' the error coming from the unboundedness of @xmath49 .",
    "+ nevertheless , all windows do not seem to have the same performance : the results obtained with the hann - squared and the bump window are smoother and more self - consistent than the ones coming from the sine squared and much more smoother than the ones given by the simple sine window . in order to point out this phenomenon ,",
    "a complementary analysis has been done : for @xmath117 , @xmath127 and integration time lenghts of @xmath128 , @xmath125 and @xmath118 , @xmath129 simulations ( each one with a different initial condition ) were run to compute a @xmath130 confidence interval of the standard deviation of @xmath131 for each one of the windows ( see figure [ varplot ] ) .",
    "the results confirm our previous remark : for a fixed @xmath9 and @xmath117 , the hann - squared and bump windows have the lowest standard deviations meaning they are more robust than the other windows . among the valid windowing functions , the simple sine gives the worst results .",
    "then , for a fixed window , we notice that increasing the time integration lenght decreases the standard deviation which is an intuitive result since when @xmath9 gets bigger the influence of the initial condition on the dynamical system fades out ( due to ergodicity ) . finally , for @xmath127 , all windows give bad results ( standard deviation of order 1 ) which can be explained by the fact that the dynamical system is no longer quasi hyperbolic for this value of @xmath100 .",
    "the theory we have developped does nt hold anymore and there is no reason for simplified lss to converge to the true value of @xmath104 ( for @xmath118 , the confidence intervals were so big and uninformative that we only represented the standard deviation estimator ) .",

    "simplified lss is an improvement of the standard lss in the sense that the time dilation factors have been removed from the formulation of the problem leading to a much simpler system of equations to solve . for a long enough integration lenght @xmath9 , both algorithms give similar results .",
    "+ the simplification has been made possible thanks to the introduction of a windowing function that mitigates the linear growth of the shadowing direction @xmath49 .",
    "this function is required to be continuously differentiable , null at its extremities and with integral equal to @xmath132 . once picked in this class of functions ,",
    "the major caracteristic of the window is the way it decays at its extremities : a rapidly decaying function such as the bump window or the hann - squared one will be less sensitive to transient behavior and give more robust results . since all windowing functions lead to the same computational cost , our study strongly recommends the choice of a fastly decaying window . in the same way ,",
