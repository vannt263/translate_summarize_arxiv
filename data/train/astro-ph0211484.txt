    "the advent of new infrared ( ir ) facilities ( both space and ground - based ) with superb spatial resolution and sensitivity is allowing us to make significant progress toward the understanding of the ir nuclear properties of local universe agn . the ir emission in agns ( seyfert galaxies and radio quiet quasars )",
    "is often interpreted as produced by hot dust in a torus / disk configuration ( e.g. , barvainis 1987 ; sanders et al . 1989 ; pier & krolik 1993 ) . however , until recently , the nuclear non - stellar ir continuum of seyfert 2 galaxies has eluded us because of the dominance of the stellar emission shortward of @xmath4 m ( e.g. , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we summarize recent results obtained by our group on the ir nuclear properties of seyfert galaxies in the local universe .",
    "we have analyzed _ hst_/nicmos @xmath2 m observations of 112 seyfert galaxies and found that @xmath5% of the seyfert 2s in the revised shapely - ames ( rsa ) catalog and cfa redshift sample contain unresolved nuclear continuum sources at @xmath2 m .",
    "most seyfert @xmath0s display unresolved nuclear continuum sources at this wavelength .",
    "these unresolved sources have @xmath2 m fluxes of order 1mjy , near - ir luminosities of order @xmath6ergs@xmath7 , and absolute magnitudes @xmath8 .",
    "non - seyfert galaxies from the rsa catalog display significantly fewer ( @xmath9% ) nuclear unresolved sources with lower luminosities , which could be due to compact star clusters .",
    "we have also found that the luminosities of the unresolved seyfert @xmath10 sources at @xmath2 m are correlated with the [ oiii]@xmath115007 and hard ( @xmath12kev ) x - ray luminosities , implying that these sources are non - stellar .",
    "we find no strong correlation between the unresolved @xmath2 m fluxes and hard x - ray or [ oiii]@xmath115007 fluxes for the pure seyfert 2s .",
    "these galaxies also tend to have lower @xmath2 m luminosities compared to the seyfert @xmath10 galaxies of similar [ oiii ] luminosity .",
    "this is in agreement with the findings of alonso - herrero et al .",
    "( 1997 ) using @xmath13 ( @xmath14 m ) nuclear fluxes .",
    "either large extinctions ( @xmath15mag ) are present toward their continuum - emitting regions or some fraction of the unresolved sources at @xmath2 m in seyfert 2s are compact star clusters ( see quillen et al .",
    "2001 for more details ) .",
    "further evidence for the non - stellar origin of the unresolved nuclear emission at @xmath2 m comes from variability shown by 9 of the 14 nuclei studied in quillen et al .",
    "the variability is at the level of @xmath16 on timescales of @xmath17 months , depending upon the galaxy . a control sample of seyfert galaxies lacking unresolved sources and galaxies lacking seyfert nuclei show less than 3% instrumental variation in equivalent aperture measurements .",
    "we have put together nuclear seds in the @xmath18 spectral range for the entire cfa sample of seyfert galaxies , including those liners reclassified as seyferts by later spectroscopic studies ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "we find that the spectral indices ( @xmath19 ) of the unresolved agn emission in the region @xmath20 vary from @xmath21 0.9 to 3.8 .",
    "the shapes of the spectra are correlated with the seyfert type in the sense that steeper nuclear seds ( @xmath22 increasing with increasing wavelength ) tend to be found in seyfert 2s and flatter seds ( @xmath23 constant ) are in the seyfert @xmath24s ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the majority of galaxies optically classified as seyferts 1.8s and 1.9s display values of @xmath25 either as in type 1 objects ( mean for type 1s @xmath26 ) , or intermediate between seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the sed of intermediate seyfert @xmath27s may be consistent with a pure seyfert 1 sed viewed through moderate amounts ( @xmath28mag ) of foreground galaxy extinction .",
    "torus models usually adopt high equatorial opacities to reproduce the ir properties of seyfert 1s and 2s ( e.g. , pier & krolik 1993 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson 1995 ) , resulting in a dichotomy of seds flat for type 1s , and steep for type 2s .",
    "such dichotomy is not observed in the cfa seyferts , and in particular there is a wide range of observed @xmath25 in type 2s ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the lack of steep seds , and large numbers of objects with intermediate spectral indices can not be reconciled with predictions from existing optically thick torus models .",
    "possible modifications to existing torus models include low optical depth tori , clumpy dusty tori and high optical tori with an extended optically thin component .",
    "the hard x - ray ( @xmath12kev ) emission of seyfert galaxies is known to be a good indicator of the intrinsic luminosity of the agn for those cases where it is transmitted through the torus , that is , in compton thin galaxies .",
    "other proposed isotropic ( that is , not dependent on the viewing angle to the agn ) indicators of the agn emission in seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s include the [ oiii]@xmath29 luminosity ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1994 ; heckman 1995 ) or the nonthermal 1.45 ghz radio continuum ( heckman 1995 ) .    we find a good correlation between ground - based @xmath30 m and _ iso _ @xmath31 m and hard x - ray fluxes and luminosities for both seyfert 1s and compton thin ( @xmath32 ) seyfert 2s ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2001 , also krabbe et al .",
    "this indicates that the mid - ir emission in seyfert galaxies can be used as a measure of the agn luminosity .",
    "the improved correlations at 4.8 and @xmath31 m with respect to those at shorter wavelengths ( alonso - herrero et al .",
    "1997 , and section  2 ) are explained in terms of the reduced extinction . some compton thick sources ( e.g. , ngc  1068 and mrk  533 ) are bright ir sources suggesting that the component responsible for the bulk of the ir emission in seyfert galaxies is more visible from all viewing angles than that responsible for the hard x - ray emission .",
    "we have also compiled a heterogeneous sample of local agn that includes seyfert 1 galaxies , seyfert 2 galaxies , and pg quasars to investigate for the first time the relation between black hole ( bh ) mass and mid - ir nuclear emission ( fig .  2 , left panel ) .",
    "we find a clear relation between the bh mass and the @xmath33 m nuclear luminosity for these local agns .",
    "there are no significant differences between type 1 and type 2 objects , implying that the reprocessing of the @xmath33 m nuclear emission is not severely affected by geometric and optical depth effects .",
    "we also confirm that the bh mass is related to the @xmath12kev x - ray luminosity , but only for compton - thin galaxies ( fig .  2 , right panel ) .",
    "our results show that rest - frame @xmath33 m and hard x - ray luminosities ( especially the former , which is applicable to all agn types ) may be used to derive bh masses at high redshift and to probe their cosmological evolution ( see alonso - herrero et al .",
    "2002a ) .",
