    "the cessation of eclipses in a binary star is a rare phenomenon that can most often be explained by the presence of a third object in the system inducing perturbations in the orbital elements of the inner pair .",
    "the modulation of the inclination angle to the line of sight , in particular , is the direct cause of a change in the orientation of the plane of the binary such that eventually the stars no longer block each other s light at conjunction .",
    "few examples of this phenomenon are known , among them ay  mus ( sderhjelm 1974 ) and v907  sco ( lacy , helt & vaz 1999 ) .",
    "an especially interesting case is ss  lacertae ( hip  108981 , bd@xmath33782 , @xmath4  days , , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , epoch and equinox j2000 ) , which stopped eclipsing around the middle of the 20@xmath0 century .",
    "our knowledge about light variations in this binary when it _ was _ eclipsing comes entirely from visual and photographic measurements that go back more than a century , but that are unfortunately of rather poor quality .",
    "however , the object has received considerable attention recently as a result of a re - measurement of archival plate material and new spectroscopic observations .",
    "lehmann ( 1991 ) re - measured original plate material from the sonneberg observatory ( 1890 - 1989 ) , presenting the first evidence that the depth of the eclipses had changed over the years .",
    "he correctly interpreted this as due to the presence of an unseen third star in the system , which is gradually changing the inclination angle of the inner pair .",
    "tomasella & munari ( 1998 ; hereafter tm98 ) derived a double - lined spectroscopic orbit for the binary , confirming earlier reports that the system had not been disrupted by a chance encounter with another star and that the period had not changed , as had been proposed initially to explain the disappearance of eclipses .",
    "milone et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter m00 ) carried out an exhaustive analysis of all available light curves of ss  lac , and presented clear confirmatory evidence of changes in the depth of the eclipses using their new measurements of the original harvard observatory patrol camera plates ( see dugan & wright 1935 ; hereafter dw35 ) as well as other published measurements .",
    "further extensive spectroscopic observations were presented by torres & stefanik ( 2000 ; hereafter ts00 ) , who showed that the system is indeed triple .",
    "they determined the orbital elements of the distant third object , with a period of about 679  days and a slightly eccentric orbit .",
    "they also detected apsidal motion for the first time , which is another manifestation of perturbations caused by the third star .",
    "further properties and the history of observations of the system are described in detail by m00 and ts00 .",
    "adding to its interest , ss lac is a member of the open cluster ngc  7209 , and therefore other information such as estimates of the age , distance , and metal abundance is available .",
    "conversely , accurate dimensions for the binary components , if they can be determined , offer a chance to perform critical tests of stellar evolution models as well as valuable clues on the cluster itself , since ss  lac is located very close to the turnoff point in the h - r diagram . as pointed out by ts00 , their high - quality spectroscopic orbital solution for ss lac has the potential of giving very precise absolute mass determinations if the inclination angle at the current epoch can be established accurately enough .",
    "spectroscopic observations only allow the minimum mass of each star to be determined , in the form of the quantity @xmath7 .",
    "the value of the inclination at the present time can only be inferred by extrapolation , and this requires in particular that its _ rate of change _ be known very accurately .",
    "estimates have been made in a variety of ways by a number of authors , as described later , but are typically based on very limited data .",
    "the motivation for this study is precisely to use the new information that has now become available in the form of light curves analyses and measurements of the amplitude of the eclipses , to improve our knowledge of the time dependence of the inclination angle and thus to allow the absolute masses and also the radii of the component stars to be established .",
    "we explore ways of doing this and apply a physically realistic model based on the known properties of the binary and the effects of the third star expected from theory .",
    "although as we describe later this potential can still not be realized because of limitations in the observations , new insights can be gained on the timescale and the pattern of the appearance and disappearance of eclipses .",
    "m00 presented measurements of the depth , @xmath8 , of the eclipses in ss  lac that show convincingly that the amplitude of the minima decreased gradually from the 1890 s and early 1900 s to shortly before the middle of the 20@xmath0 century , when eclipses were last recorded .",
    "the peak amplitude is believed to have occurred around 1910 or so .",
    "we will re - examine these data in detail in  3 , but we focus first on a procedure to extract information on the rate of change of the inclination angle from these measurements .    as a means of estimating the approximate time of onset and cessation of eclipses , or the beginning and end of the _ eclipse season _ , as they termed it , m00 presented a quadratic fit to the measurements around the primary eclipse as a function of time ( their fig .",
    "7 ) that provides a reasonable representation of the data .",
    "they correctly pointed out , however , that a quadratic fit is not necessarily a realistic model for the true variation , which is more likely to taper off at either side of the maximum rather than end abruptly .",
    "as an alternative , m00 discussed a fit to a model involving the complementary error function^2\\right\\}$ ] .",
    "the quadratic argument makes the function symmetrical around the maximum . for the benefit of other readers we note also that the phases listed in their table  10 and table  11 , while computed from the tm98 ephemeris , have an integer number of cycles added ( 2713 ) to render them positive",
    ". also , the cycle number for their primary minimum # 40 should read 2421.988 . ] , which has the desired property of decreasing slowly at both ends although it still lacks any physical basis and is merely a mathematical tool .",
    "the true variation of the depth of the eclipses may be separated into two parts : a function we call @xmath9 ( one for each minimum ) , which describes the change in the amplitude as a function of the inclination angle @xmath10 , and a second function @xmath11 that describes the time variation of @xmath10 .",
    "this latter function is what we seek to determine from the observations .",
    "we will assume here that the inclination angle is the only orbital element that changes significantly with time due to the third star , although strictly speaking this may not be true for ss  lac .",
    "on the one hand apsidal motion has been detected ( ts00 ) , and the secular variation in @xmath12 ( the longitude of periastron ) will alter the shape of the light curve slightly over long timescales ( @xmath11000  yr ; see ts00 ) . on the other hand the perturbations from the third star can also cause a modulation of the eccentricity of the binary ( see , e.g. , mazeh & shaham 1979 ) , although this effect has not yet been detected .",
    "neither of these effects will change the amplitude of the eclipses appreciably in this case , so for our purposes all elements except @xmath10 may be assumed to be constant .",
    "similar arguments to describe the time variation of @xmath8 appear to have been used by lehmann ( 1991 ) in the first report presenting evidence of morphological changes in the light curve of ss  lac , although few details are given .",
    "he correctly attributed the changes in the inclination angle to perturbations from a third object in the system , and estimated the timescale for the variation .",
    "the change in the depth of the eclipses as a function of the inclination angle can be derived in a fairly straightforward way once a fit to a representative set of observations has been made , using any of the current computer codes to analyze a binary light curve .",
    "one simply holds all elements fixed and changes @xmath10 to produce a family of synthetic light curves , and then measures the depth of the eclipses ( separately at both minima ) on each of these as a function of @xmath10 . a table can then be produced that represents @xmath9 , and this may be interpolated for ease of use .",
    "the critical step here is arriving at a light curve solution from the real observations that accurately represents the physical properties of the components .",
    "the very fact that the light curve is changing with time and the relatively poor quality of the historical brightness measurements of ss  lac make this step more difficult than it would seem .",
    "light curve analyses of the photometric observations for ss  lac have been described in detail by m00 .",
    "they used the university of calgary version of the wilson - devinney code ( wilson 1992 ; milone , stagg & kurucz 1992 ; stagg & milone 1993 ; kallrath et al .",
    "1998 ) , and examined the three most complete data sets available :    \\1 .",
    "photographic measurements by dw35 based on harvard college observatory patrol camera plates , covering the interval 1890 - 1934 . these were published only in graphical form as an average light curve , already folded using the ephemeris by the authors .",
    "a sizeable fraction of these plates and subsequent plates taken at harvard were re - measured by schiller , bridges , & clifton ( 1996 ) , although these new measures were not used by m00 for their light curve analyses .",
    "photographic measurements by wachmann ( 1936 ) based on plates from bergedorf spanning the interval 1924 - 1932 .",
    "low light levels occur only during the last two years of this interval .",
    "visual estimates by kordylewski , pagaczewski , & szafraniec ( 1961 ) between 1927 and 1948 .",
    "in all cases the solutions were iterated with fits to the radial velocity measurements of tm98 , under various assumptions on the relative temperatures , luminosities , and mass ratio of the components . in their attempt to avoid smearing of the light curve due to real changes in shape as a function of time , m00 analyzed these three data sets separately . as a result",
    "some of them are rather sparse , which adds to the difficulties imposed by the poor quality of the observations .",
    "in addition , there are some inconsistencies between separate solutions , and in the end m00 adopted their results for the dw35 data set as being more reliable .",
    "a light curve solution for ss  lac was also presented by ts00 , who chose to merge the datasets by dw35 and wachmann ( 1936 ) since they overlap in time .",
    "they used the computer program ebop ( etzel 1981 ; popper & etzel 1981 ) , which , although simpler than the wilson - devinney code , is quite adequate for this well - detached system .",
    "the m00 and ts00 solutions show some significant differences , no doubt a reflection of the difficulties mentioned above , but also because the m00 analyses were done without the benefit of the new spectroscopic information obtained by ts00 , which only appeared later .",
    "the light ratio ( secondary / primary ) derived by m00 is approximately 2.2 , while the spectroscopic measurements by ts00 indicate a value quite close to unity ( @xmath13 ) , with much larger ratios being clearly ruled out by those observations .",
    "tm98 seem to concur with ts00 , at least qualitatively , reporting that the secondary is  slightly \" more luminous than the primary from the relative depths of the doppler cores and h@xmath14 line wings in their spectra .",
    "because of the inherent difficulty of determining the ratio of the radii , @xmath15 , from light curves such as that of ss  lac in which the stars are nearly equal and the eclipses only partial , ts00 incorporated their spectroscopic light ratio as an external constraint on their light curve solution . in this way they derived a ratio of the radii of @xmath16 ( secondary / primary ) .",
    "the unconstrained solution by m00 , on the other hand , leads to a value of @xmath15 around 1.5 , similar to that obtained originally by dw35 also without the use of an external constraint .",
    "such a large value seems somewhat unusual for main - sequence stars with very similar masses ( @xmath17 ; ts00 ) .",
    "we note also that the maximum amplitude of the minima from the m00 solution , setting @xmath18 , is @xmath10.45  mag ( see fig .  1 ) , whereas their empirical fit to the measured amplitudes , mentioned earlier , suggests peak values considerably higher than this .",
    "several of the measurements of the depth of the eclipses presented by the same authors ( their table  10 and table  11 ) also reach larger values ( as large as 0.76 in one case ) between 1900 and 1910 .",
    "similar indications are seen in the work by lehmann ( 1991 ) .",
    "admittedly some of these measurements suggesting deeper minima have rather large errors due to the photographic nature of the material , and two of them by m00 at about the epoch of maximum amplitude actually have much lower values , as do two independent measurements by lehmann .",
    "further light may be shed on this issue by examining the individual brightness estimates for ss  lac from the harvard plates as re - measured by schiller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( see also m00 ) .",
    "these measurements were kindly provided to the author by e.  f.  milone .",
    "2 shows a sequence of those measurements from 12 harvard plates taken on the night of 1902 may 30 ( jd @xmath19 ) during a primary eclipse .",
    "the brightness estimates have been referred , for convenience , to the mean light level of the system outside of eclipse .",
    "comparison with the same curves shown in fig .",
    "1 gives the clear impression that the primary minimum was indeed deeper than 0.45  mag , and that the data are considerably better represented by the ts00 curve .",
    "the solution by ts00 for @xmath18 indicates depths of about 0.7  mag , which is close to what is expected for component stars of roughly equal brightness .",
    "the adoption of a representative light curve solution has a rather significant impact on the results described below .",
    "although the ts00 solution is certainly not exempt from criticism , based on the arguments presented above we have chosen for the present analysis to adopt that solution as a more consistent representation of the physical properties of the stars in ss  lac , pending improvements that may become possible as we discuss later in  6 . using ebop as described earlier we have determined the functions @xmath20 and d@xmath21 for the depths of the primary and secondary eclipse , respectively , which do not differ greatly .",
    "they are represented graphically in fig .",
    "the simplest approximation , and the one usually adopted , is that of a uniform variation of the inclination angle with time . as a convenient expression",
    "we adopt @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the epoch at which eclipses are central ( @xmath24 ) . in  5",
    "we describe a more realistic representation but we show also that , given the quality of the data at our disposal , the linear expression is a sufficiently accurate description in the time interval covered by the present data . for other purposes such as large extrapolations or determining the boundaries of the eclipse season of ss  lac ,",
    "a linear change in @xmath10 is inadequate ( see  6 ) .",
    "several estimates of the slope @xmath25 have been made in recent years based on a variety of assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "lehmann ( 1991 ) used measurements of the eclipse amplitudes based on photographic plates from the sonneberg observatory in a procedure similar to what we described above , and obtained @xmath26  deg  yr@xmath27 .",
    "he also estimated the eclipses to have been central in @xmath28 .",
    "few of the details are given , however , and the original data are not available except in graphical form .",
    "tm98 assumed typical radii for the stars ( @xmath29  r@xmath30 ) based on an adopted spectral classification . from the linear separation between the components derived from their spectroscopic orbital solution they estimated the inclination angle at the end of the eclipsing season to be @xmath31 .",
    "the authors assumed that the eclipses were central in 1900 - 1915 , and also that they disappeared at about 1960 based on lehmann s ( 1991 ) work . from this they arrived at @xmath32  deg  yr@xmath27 . extrapolating to the mean epoch of their radial velocity measurements they estimated @xmath33 .",
    "m00 estimated the inclination angle at the mean epoch of the velocity measurements by tm98 to be @xmath34 , through a procedure involving iterations between separate spectroscopic and light - curve solutions using the photometric data by dw35 . adopting an epoch of 1912 for central",
    "eclipses , they then obtained @xmath35  deg  yr@xmath27 .",
    "ts00 combined the photographic measurements by dw35 and wachmann ( 1936 ) to obtain a light curve solution giving @xmath36 , which they assigned to a mean epoch of @xmath37 .",
    "based on this analysis and on their spectroscopic orbit , they estimated the minimum inclination angle for eclipses to occur to be @xmath38 , and adopted 1951 as the epoch of cessation of eclipses . from this",
    "they derived @xmath39  deg  yr@xmath27 .",
    "although all these estimates of @xmath25 turn out to be rather similar , they are not independent and the assumptions made are quite varied and sometimes inconsistent , mostly due to limitations in the observational material . in the sections that follow",
    "we describe our own efforts based on observations that have not been used before for this purpose .",
    "measurements of the depth of the eclipses in ss  lac were compiled by m00 from several sources : their own re - measurement of many of the original harvard plates used by dw35 ; photographic observations published by wachmann ( 1936 ) , nekrasova ( 1938 ) , and mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) ; visual determinations by kordylewski et al.(1961 ) ; and more recent photoelectric measurements obtained by them at the rothney astrophysical observatory and also by mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) , after the eclipses stopped .",
    "a total of 43 estimates of @xmath8 were collected for the primary minimum , and 27 for the secondary minimum , over a period of nearly 100 years .",
    "some of them are averages determined from several individual brightness measurements .",
    "in addition to these , lehmann ( 1991 ) reported estimates of the amplitude of the eclipses from sonneberg observatory plates , but they were published only in graphical form .",
    "further photographic observations of ss  lac were made by tashpulatov ( 1965 ) from 1937 to 1955 .",
    "however , these data have been called into question by mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) , and a re - examination of some of the original plate material by other investigators has cast similar doubts ( see m00 ) . because of this , and because they contain relatively few measurements at low light levels , we have not considered the tashpulatov observations here . with regard to the other measurements , for the purpose of this paper we ignore the minor difference between the visual and photographic bands , following m00 .    the crucial ingredient in the selection of brightness measurements for estimating the amplitude of the eclipses is the ephemeris used to establish which observations are near an eclipse .",
    "m00 adopted the ephemeris by tm98 , min  i  @xmath40 , which was the most recent at the time .",
    "a much more accurate determination is now available from ts00 , based on all published times of eclipse as well as their new radial - velocity measurements , and accounting also for light travel time ( due to the presence of the third star ) and apsidal motion .",
    "the sidereal period ( @xmath41  days ) is significantly different from the previous value , and one order of magnitude more precise . over the time interval in which the eclipse amplitude measurements of m00 are non - zero ( @xmath11890 - 1940 , or 50  yr ) , the difference in the periods alone accumulates to a phase shift of 0.02 , almost exactly half of the width of an eclipse . in extreme cases a measurement regarded by m00 to be near",
    "mid - eclipse may actually fall beyond the limits of eclipse , leading to an underestimate of depth of the corresponding minimum .",
    "this is especially true given that m00 adopted the conservative approach ( precisely to allow for possible errors in the tm98 ephemeris ) of including all brightness measurements they determined to be within @xmath42 in phase from the minima , which is actually twice the true half - width of the eclipses .",
    "an illustration of this effect can be seen in fig .",
    "4 . in the top panel",
    "we show 17 visual brightness estimates obtained near primary eclipse by kordylewski et al .",
    "( 1961 ) on the night of 1930 november 28 ( filled symbols ) , phased with the ephemeris by tm98 .",
    "this is the longest published sequence of measurements made on a single night during an eclipse that shows a clear change in brightness .",
    "the light curve displayed for comparison purposes is from the solution adopted in  2.1 , with a maximum depth appropriate for the date of these observations .",
    "also shown with a different symbol are all measurements by wachmann ( 1936 ) that are near primary eclipse .",
    "these observations are confined to a 2-yr interval ( mean epoch @xmath11931.8 ) , as mentioned in  2.1 , that happens to be very close to the kordylewski date .",
    "the phase shift is fairly obvious for both data sets .",
    "when the same measurements are folded with the ephemeris by ts00 , on the other hand , the fit is considerably better ( lower panel ) .",
    "we point out , incidentally , that both the kordylewski observations and the wachmann observations are completely independent of the ephemeris by ts00 since they were not used by the authors in its derivation , and thus they serve as an independent check on its accuracy , @xmath11902.4 ) were folded with the tm98 ephemeris , yet they show good phase agreement with the predicted light curves , seemingly conflicting with the evidence above .",
    "as it turns out , if the phasing is done instead with the ts00 ephemeris the result is essentially the same because both prescriptions made use of the main epoch of primary minimum from dw35 in their determination , which happens to be the very night of these measurements . in the case of tm98 this epoch",
    "is imposed exactly , and for ts00 it enters more weakly as part of a least squares adjustment .",
    "the main difference will then be simply a phase shift , equal to the residual of that epoch of primary minimum from the ts00 fit ( see their table  6 ) . ] .",
    "additional phase errors may be incurred because of uncertainties in the epoch , or even in the geometric elements @xmath43 ( eccentricity ) and @xmath12 , which essentially determine the location of the secondary minimum in relation to the primary through the quantity @xmath44 .",
    "1 shows some hint of this effect ( lower panel ) .    as pointed out by m00 ,",
    "it is to be expected that some measurements will fall on the branches of the minima , and therefore they will underestimate the true amplitude . to assess the importance of this effect they plotted the measured eclipse depths as a function of phase ( their fig .",
    "6 ) . from the fact that not all low amplitude values showed large displacements from the centers of the eclipses they concluded that the effect was unimportant . if the phases are computed instead with the new ephemeris , the general impression from such a plot is rather different ( see fig .  5 ) :",
    "nearly all low amplitude values are quite far from mid - eclipse , and several are even beyond the true limits of the eclipse ( c.f .  fig .  1 ) .",
    "this suggests that some of the amplitudes may indeed be underestimated , and again that the contamination from measurements outside of eclipse can not be ignored .",
    "this prompted us to revise the compilation of eclipse depths by m00 by re - examining all the original data using the new ephemeris .",
    "as a result , our list of amplitudes for the primary and for the secondary eclipse is somewhat different : some estimates were removed because they lie outside of eclipse , and new ones were added .",
    "the 591 harvard measurements used by m00 were made available to us by the senior author , and in addition we considered the measurements from wachmann ( 1936 ) , nekrasova ( 1938 ) , kordylewski et al.(1961 ) , and mossakovskaya ( 1993 ) .",
    "for each source we first computed the average magnitude outside of eclipse .",
    "each measurement during an eclipse was then compared to this average level to derive the amplitude . in the case of the harvard data three observations during primary minimum and",
    "one during secondary minimum were much _",
    "brighter _ than the average level outside of eclipse ( by up to 0.75  mag ) , and were rejected . on nights with several brightness estimates during eclipse we averaged the data as well as the dates , except in cases when the sequence of measurements crossed over from the descending branch to the ascending branch . in such instances the average brightness will always underestimate the true amplitude at the average phase , and therefore we split the data at the center of the eclipse .",
    "the uncertainty we assigned to an amplitude estimate is the standard deviation of a single observation outside of eclipse , for each source . in cases where several measurements were averaged ,",
    "the error was decreased by the square root of the number of observations .",
    "finally , we included an estimate in 1991 derived from the hipparcos measurements ( esa 1997 ) , which was shown by ts00 to be very close to mid - secondary eclipse .",
    "table  1 and table  2 list all the measurements we considered for the primary ( 40 ) and the secondary eclipse ( 45 ) , respectively .",
    "[ tab1 ]    [ tab2 ]    unfortunately the original dates of the measurements by lehmann ( 1991 ) have not been published , and this prevents us from recomputing the phases to establish whether they can be incorporated into the analysis .",
    "we have therefore chosen not to use them here .",
    "the procedure we followed consists of fitting the @xmath45 model ( composed of @xmath20 and @xmath46 for the primary and secondary eclipse , and @xmath11 , as described above ) to the eclipse depth measurements , in order to determine @xmath11 . measured amplitudes for both the primary and secondary eclipses were used simultaneously . because many of these estimates are not exactly centered at the minima , and therefore will always underestimate the true amplitude , they must first be corrected for this systematic effect .",
    "this was done as follows . for each date of observation we predicted an inclination angle using a preliminary estimate of @xmath11 . with this",
    "we computed a synthetic light curve using ebop , which therefore has an amplitude appropriate for the date of the measurement .",
    "next we calculated the phase of the observation using the ephemeris , and we applied a correction to the measured depth equal to the difference in magnitude between a point on the curve with the same phase as the observation , and a point at the center of the eclipse .",
    "amplitude measurements displaced in phase by 0.017 or more from the center of a primary or secondary minimum ( half width = 0.02 ) were not considered , to guard against possible errors in the ephemeris ( period or epoch , or perhaps even residual variations that have not been accounted for caused , for example , by the presence of additional stars in the system ) and also because such a small drop in brightness is essentially within the errors of measurement of the visual and photographic techniques .",
    "we then carried out the fit for @xmath25 and @xmath23 , and improved our preliminary estimate of @xmath11 .",
    "the procedure is iterative , and at each step the corrections are slightly different .",
    "the eclipse ephemeris reported by ts00 was derived by those authors simultaneously with the apsidal motion and with the spectroscopic elements of the eclipsing binary and of the tertiary star ( including light - time effects , which can amount to 1/10 of the eclipse half - width ) . because the apsidal motion depends on the assumed inclination angle , and",
    "this angle is time - dependent , ts00 adopted their own determination of @xmath11 to account for this variation .",
    "therefore , the phases we initially compute here from this ephemeris also depend in principle on that determination of @xmath11 relied to some extent on observations by tashpulatov ( 1965 ) , through the estimated epoch of cessation of eclipses .",
    "their ephemeris derivation indirectly incorporated this time dependence of @xmath10 , although in practice it has little or no effect on the results . as mentioned in  3 , the tashpulatov observations are now considered to be unreliable",
    "however , because of the procedure adopted here , any residual effect from those data on the present analysis disappears completely after the first iteration . ] . in order to be self - consistent , for the present analysis we have recomputed the ephemeris at each iteration using the same methods and the same data employed by ts00 ( times of eclipse , and radial velocities ) , starting from their estimate .",
    "successive iterations use updated expressions for @xmath11 , and the change in the phases calculated at each step was found to be very small .",
    "the apsidal motion and spectroscopic elements also did not change significantly .",
    "the procedure converged in 7 iterations , using standard non - linear least - squares techniques at each step to solve for @xmath25 and @xmath23 ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "1992 ) . in order to ensure that we converged at the absolute minimum of the @xmath47 surface , rather than at a local minimum",
    ", we checked the results using a genetic algorithm ( see charbonneau 1995 ) , which explores all of parameter space .",
    "6 displays our best fit to the amplitude measurements of the primary and secondary eclipse , in which the resulting time variation of the inclination angle is represented by @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "the maximum amplitude ( corresponding to central eclipses ) according to this fit was therefore reached somewhere between 1904 and 1907 .",
    "table  1 and table  2 include the phase displacement of each measurement , the final amplitude corrections we applied , and the corrected eclipse depths as used in the least squares adjustments and figures .",
    "as pointed out earlier , a linear approximation to the time dependence of the inclination angle may be valid over relatively short time intervals ( i.e. , the duration of the observations in our case ) , but in reality the change in @xmath10 is more complex .",
    "perturbations induced by the third star on the inner pair cause the angular momentum vectors of both orbits to precess around the total angular momentum vector of the system , which is fixed in space .",
    "the phenomenon is known as the  regression of the nodes \" effect ( sderhjelm 1975 ; mazeh & shaham 1976 ) .",
    "one of the observable consequences is a periodic change in the inclination angle of the inner orbit that may be expressed conveniently for our case as @xmath49,\\ ] ] in which @xmath50 is the angle between the invariable plane of the system ( which is perpendicular to the total angular momentum vector ) and the plane of the sky .",
    "the angle @xmath51 is measured between the orbital plane of the eclipsing binary and the invariable plane , and the argument of the cosine term on the far right represents the secular change in @xmath52 , the longitude of the ascending node of the binary orbit , with a period @xmath53 .",
    "the angle @xmath50 is constant , but in general @xmath51 may also vary on long timescales , although this would be problematic to measure and is likely to be a small effect . for the purpose of this paper we will consider @xmath51 not to vary . as before , @xmath23 represents the epoch at which @xmath10 reaches @xmath54 . the angle",
    "@xmath55 is the position angle of the ascending node at the same instant . from the condition of",
    "central eclipses @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , and thus the four unknowns in the new expression for @xmath11 are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 , and @xmath23 .",
    "given the quality of the data available for ss  lac it is unrealistic to attempt to solve for all four parameters .",
    "however , the nodal period can be estimated from the theory of three - body interactions .",
    "ts00 gave an order - of - magnitude estimate of 500  yr .",
    "an improved value may be obtained from the expression derived by sderhjelm ( 1975 ) ( his eq.[27 ] ) , which depends not only on the masses of the three stars ( and therefore on the unknown inclination angles of the inner and outer orbits ) , but also on the orbital periods ( known ) , the outer eccentricity ( known ) , and the relative angle between the orbits as well as the orientation of each orbit relative to the invariable plane of the system .",
    "several useful constraints on some of these quantities were discussed by ts00 .",
    "for example , from the fact that eclipses no longer occur the inclination angle of the binary at the present time must be smaller than @xmath57 , based on the size and separation of the components .",
    "in addition , the inclination of the plane of the outer orbit with respect to the line of sight is expected to be no smaller than @xmath58 based on the spectroscopic solution , since smaller angles would imply that the third star would be massive enough and therefore bright enough that it would have been detected spectroscopically , if it is a main - sequence star .",
    "this , in turn , along with the measured apsidal motion , restricts the range of possible values for the relative inclination angle between the orbits ( @xmath59 ) to be between about @xmath60 and @xmath58 ( ts00 ) .",
    "though all these limits are helpful , the various angles involved are still not known exactly , so we have performed monte carlo simulations subject to all available constraints in order to determine the probability distribution of @xmath53 .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "periods near 680  yr seem more likely , but the range of possible values extends from 600 to 700  yr .",
    "sderhjelm ( 1982 ) has tested the accuracy of the analytical expression used above for @xmath53 by direct integration of the equations of motion in the three - body problem . for stars with orbital and dynamical characteristics similar to those in ss  lac he concluded that @xmath61 may be overestimated by that equation by up to 10% or so .",
    "we may therefore adopt as a representative value for ss  lac a nodal period of @xmath62  yr .",
    "to arrive at the best fit to the observations we again used a genetic algorithm to search the parameter space , and found two solutions that are conjugates of each other ( the result of a reflection of some of the angles around @xmath63 ) .",
    "they represent physically equivalent scenarios that correspond to direct and retrograde motion of the binary on the plane of the sky .",
    "to determine which of these configurations holds for this system requires astrometric measurements , which are not available for ss  lac . in both cases",
    "the plane of the orbit of the binary is moving away from @xmath54 at the present time , and the consequence for eclipses is the same .",
    "mathematically the ambiguity is expressed by the inclination angle numerically increasing or decreasing from @xmath54 during the 20@xmath0 century .",
    "choosing the scenario in which @xmath10 is decreasing ( as was done implicitly in  4 and following the usual convention ) , we performed least - squares fits as in  4 to solve for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath23 , using the data for both eclipses simultaneously .",
    "the corrections to the measured amplitudes were adopted from the final iteration in  4 ( see table  1 and table  2 ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , which are consistent with all available constraints .",
    "the angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 are significantly correlated , and this is reflected in their formal uncertainties .",
    "8 shows this fit ( solid lines ) along with the corrected observations . for comparison",
    "we show also the solution from  4 using a linear model for @xmath11 ( dashed lines ) , which is seen to be very similar to the new result and provides an equally good fit .",
    "the epoch of maximum eclipse amplitude is essentially the same in both solutions .",
    "even though the fits from both models for @xmath11 are virtually indistinguishable given the errors in the observations , the corresponding predictions for the long - term behavior of the inclination angle and the implications for the eclipsing seasons of ss  lac are very different .",
    "according to the linear model the inclination angle completes a full revolution in 2500  yr , leading to eclipse seasons that repeat every 1250  yr . however , a secular change in @xmath10 is not what is generally expected from three - body interactions .",
    "instead , the inclination typically oscillates in a roughly sinusoidal fashion , the exact shape depending on the angles involved in eq.(2 ) .",
    "the period of this modulation for ss  lac is about @xmath67  yr , as discussed above , which is the length of a full nodal cycle .",
    "the eclipse  seasons \" ( defined here as intervals when eclipses happen ) can in general occur once or twice during the cycle . in the present case",
    "the indications are that there are _ two _ seasons per nodal cycle , each lasting roughly 100  yr .",
    "this is shown in fig .  9 , where we display the depth of the eclipses ( primary and secondary ) over an interval of 1500  yr according to the model fit in  5 , as well as the behavior of the inclination angle to the line of sight .",
    "eclipses can take place only for values of @xmath10 in the shaded area indicated in the lower panel ( @xmath68 ; see ts00 ) .",
    "the eclipse seasons recur in pairs , which combined last for about 350  yr . the observations during the 20@xmath69 century ( top two panels ) are seen to cover the second season of one of such pairs , and no further eclipses are expected until shortly after the year 2200 , if the present model is correct . for comparison",
    "we show also in the bottom panel the trend expected for the inclination angle according to the linear model ( dashed line ;  4 ) , which is seen to match the slope of the more realistic model very well at the present time .",
    "the conjugate solution mentioned in  5 gives an identical pattern of eclipse seasons , but the function representing @xmath11 is a reflection about an axis at @xmath18 of the curve drawn in the lower panel of fig",
    "the end of an eclipse season depends in practice on the precision of the measurements , as argued by m00 .",
    "they concluded on the basis of their analysis of the amplitudes that , in the absence of photoelectric data , the eclipses effectively ended between 1937 and 1938 .",
    "the slower decline resulting from the present fits favors a somewhat later date around 1945 for the primary eclipses and @xmath11950 for the secondary eclipses , if we assume that amplitudes under 0.1  mag are undetectable by the visual and photographic techniques applied to ss  lac .",
    "also , central eclipses occurred some 5 or 6 years earlier than in the m00 estimate according to the fits in  4 or  5 .",
    "though probably closer to the truth than the linear form of @xmath11 , the more sophisticated  regression of the nodes \" model is not without its weaknesses .",
    "the fit to this model is not as robust as the simpler approximation , partly because of the lack of amplitude measurements to the left of the maximum . instead of two unknowns",
    ", three quantities must be solved for ( after fixing @xmath53 ) out of the limited amount of information contained in the data . in addition",
    ", the errors given for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath23 do not include uncertainties in the mean light curve adopted from ts00 , in the value of @xmath53 , or in the constraints used on @xmath51 , which are based on the measured apsidal motion as reported by ts00 .",
    "all these uncertainties are rather difficult to quantify .",
    "we can not rule out that , given additional measurements of the depth of the minima , the detailed shape of the function depicted in fig .  9 as well as",
    "the pattern of the eclipse seasons described above could change somewhat , particularly regarding the spacing of the two seasons in each nodal cycle .    as it turns out",
    ", the inclination angle of the orbital plane of the binary extrapolated to the mean epoch of the spectroscopic observations by ts00 ( @xmath11998 ) remains ill - determined . from the linear model for @xmath11 we obtain @xmath70 , while the other model predicts @xmath71 , which would seem to indicate good agreement .",
    "although the formal errors in these quantities are roughly @xmath72 , the true uncertainty is likely to be larger so that the absolute dimensions of the components can still not be computed reliably , especially considering also the possible systematic errors in the mean light curve ( see below ) .",
    "the main limitation in the present analysis lies in the quantity and quality of the data , both for the amplitude measurements and the light curves .",
    "however , improvements can still be made in both areas .",
    "it is possible that useful information on the depths of the eclipses can still be extracted from the harvard plates that were not re - measured by schiller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , as well as from the valuable plate material obtained at the sonneberg observatory and used by lehmann ( 1991 ) , but never published .",
    "the light curve solutions might also benefit from these new measurements , and this is important not only to improve our knowledge of the physical properties of the components in ss  lac , but for the determination of the depth functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 as well (  2.1 ) .    the most difficult problem faced by all previous investigators attempting to fit the light curves of ss",
    "lac has been the fact that the inclination angle of the binary changes with time .",
    "inevitably this will affect the solution in subtle ways , and it is likely that several of the photometric elements are biased to some degree as a result of the averaging of the measurements during the minima , as the amplitude changes .",
    "a complication of a similar nature has been noted before by other investigators concerning the apsidal motion in eccentric binaries , particularly in systems with short apsidal periods . in this case , even if an accurate apparent period from a linear ephemeris is used for the primary , the effect is a distortion and widening of the secondary minimum because of the changing longitude of periastron .",
    "an example where this distortion is quite important is v477  cyg .",
    "the solution to the problem of variable photometric elements would seem rather obvious , yet the common practice has been to circumvent the issue by dividing up the data into shorter time intervals , with the effect that data sets are poorer and the phase coverage more incomplete , as in ss  lac . if the change in the element(s ) is linear to first order , as is often the case , it should not be difficult to correct for this directly in the computer program used to solve the light curve , allowing for the variation as a function of time . in the apsidal motion case , this has in fact been done for the system mentioned above , v477  cyg , by gimnez & quintana ( 1992 ) using the computer program ebop .",
    "they modified the appropriate subroutines so that the phase calculated for each observation accounts for the change in the longitude of periastron using a pre - determined value of @xmath75 .",
    "similarly , either ebop , the wilson - devinney code , or other programs in use could in principle be modified to account for @xmath25 in calculating the theoretical flux to be compared with each photometric measurement , thus referring all observations to a standard ( arbitrary ) epoch with a _ fixed _",
    "inclination angle .",
    "more ambitious investigators might be tempted to add @xmath25 as a variable to be determined from the solution along with the other light elements , but this may only be possible in the best observed systems .",
    "alternatively , the individual photographic and visual observations for ss  lac may first be corrected along the lines described in  4 for the amplitude measurements , and then submitted to the light curve analysis .",
    "this would require no change in the current computer codes .",
    "the present analysis of the eclipse amplitude measurements could then be repeated once an improved light curve solution becomes available , and the procedure iterated until convergence .",
    "among the very few eclipsing binaries in which the amplitudes of the minima have been seen to change , to the point where the eclipses disappear completely due to the cumulative effect of the perturbations from a third star in the system , only a handful are as well documented as ss  lac . despite obvious limitations in the observational material spanning more than a century ,",
    "this has presented us with a rare opportunity to learn more about the configuration of the system in the light of current theoretical ideas about three - body interactions among stars . in particular , the eclipse amplitude measurements provide a valuable record of the change in the inclination angle that , with the possible exception of the succinct report by lehmann ( 1991 ) , has not been investigated in detail by applying the direct constraints offered by these observations .    the three main contributions of this paper to the study of this phenomenon are ( i ) the use of a more accurate ephemeris ( from ts00 ) to select from the historical record the brightness measurements that were obtained during an eclipse ; ( ii ) the application of corrections to the amplitude estimates to account for the systematically lower values typically measured on the branches of the minima ; and ( iii ) the consideration of more physically realistic models than used before for the change in the eclipse depth , based on the known properties of the system ( mean light curve solution ) and expressions for the expected time variation of the inclination angle .",
    "for the latter we have explored both a linear approximation that is found to be quite satisfactory over the period covered by the observations , and a more rigorous prescription derived from the theory of the  regression of the nodes \" effect in triple systems .",
    "equally good fits are achieved with both expressions for @xmath11 , but realistic long - term predictions on the future occurrence of eclipses in ss  lac can only be made from the second approach .",
    "our fits suggest that the eclipse seasons ( duration @xmath1100  yr ) come in pairs that repeat after about 600  yr , and that we may expect the current lack of eclipses to last until approximately the beginning of the 23@xmath76 century .",
