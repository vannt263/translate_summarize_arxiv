    "_ stochastic resonance _ ( sr ) describes the phenomenon where an incoming , generally weak signal can become amplified upon harvesting the ambient noise in metastable , nonlinear stochastic systems @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is based on a stochastic synchronization between noise - induced hopping events and the periodic , externally applied signal @xcite .",
    "sr has since been observed in an abundance of systems in physics , chemistry , engineering , biology and biomedical sciences  and the list of examples and applications is still growing .",
    "in particular sr has found widespread interest and has been applied to many differing applications within biological physics @xcite . in many situations ,",
    "however , the strength of the noise acting upon a system is not arbitrarily controllable ; e.g. the strength of the internal noise source can be so large that sr simply will not occur , as it may happen for sr in globally coupled ion channel clusters of small size @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of ultimate importance to devise control schemes to attain and manipulate sr in real systems .",
    "a concept which was proposed in prior literature @xcite in order to enhance or suppress the spectral power is based on a modulation of the threshold in a discrete detector or in a bistable system dynamics .",
    "this in turn results in `` breathing '' oscillations of the barriers . by doing so , the `` classical '' sr effect could be both characteristically enhanced and suppressed by changing the phase difference between the threshold modulation and the input signal .",
    "in this work we suggest a different , although related control scheme which we base on harmonic mixing input signal @xcite",
    ". the sinusoidal input signal is superposed by a second , sinusoidal signal with twice the frequency of the former , monochromatic input signal . by controlling the phase difference between these two signal parts",
    "we obtain a powerful tool for the manipulation of sr .",
    "to start out , we consider the motion of a brownian particle in a bistable and symmetric potential in the presence of noise and periodic forcing .",
    "the particle is furthermore subjected to viscous friction . with the assumption that inertia effects are negligible ( overdamped dynamics ) , the driven langevin dynamics reads in scaled units @xcite :    @xmath2    with the static double - well potential given by @xmath3 . the harmonic mixing driving signal @xmath4 has the form , @xmath5 the relative phase difference is denoted by @xmath6 , and it is this quantity which we shall predominantly use in the following as our control parameter for steering sr .",
    "the coupling to the heat bath is modeled by zero - mean , gaussian white noise @xmath7 with autocorrelation function : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the noise strength .    the corresponding fokker - planck equation for the probability density @xmath10 @xcite is thus given by , @xmath11 p(x , t )    + d \\frac{{\\partial}^{2}}{{\\partial}x^{2 } } p(x , t)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the absence of the second signal ( i.e. @xmath12 ) eq .",
    "forms the archetypical model for sr@xcite . the dependence of sr - measures such as the spectral power amplification @xcite or the signal - to - noise ratio @xcite , respectively , exhibits a bell - shaped behavior _ vs. _ the noise strength @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , due to the dynamical generalized parity symmetry @xcite only odd higher harmonics emerge which all exhibit the effect of sr . in contrast , for asymmetric double - well potentials also the even numbered higher harmonics are generated : the generation rate of the third harmonic then depicts a characteristic noise - induced suppression @xcite . due to our harmonic mixing signal , and particularly due to the relative phase difference @xmath6 and the ratio of amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , we can systematically break the symmetry dynamically and thus , control the response at higher harmonics .",
    "before we elucidate the fokker - planck dynamics ( [ eq : fokkerplanck ] ) , the deterministic case is instructive for obtaining an understanding of the physics of the harmonic mixing driving on the dynamics of a particle in a symmetric double - well .",
    "the langevin equation ( [ eq : langevin ] ) thus turns into the time - dependent deterministic equation :    @xmath15    in absence of any modulation , i.e. @xmath16 , there exist two stable attractors at @xmath17 and one unstable attractor at @xmath18 . for sub - threshold harmonic mixing , @xmath19 , two oscillatory stable orbits are formed within the potential wells .",
    "the domains of attraction are separated by an unstable orbit , oscillating close to the former , unstable point near the barrier .",
    "are plotted for @xmath20 in fig .",
    "( a ) with @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast , there exists also a parameter regime for the phase difference @xmath6 where only one stable orbit exists ( depicted in panel ( b ) ) .",
    "for example , the orbit is located in the left potential well for @xmath22 ( solid line ) and in the right well for @xmath23 ( dashed line ) ; harmonic mixing thus causes symmetry breaking . ]    upon increasing the amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , the oscillations of the stable and instable orbits become larger ; consequently , the corresponding orbits approach each other . at",
    "even stronger driving the situation changes drastically and the variation of the phase difference @xmath6 possesses salient effects : the symmetry breaking by the harmonic mixing signal becomes evident : in fig .",
    "[ fig : deterministic ] the amplitudes @xmath13 and @xmath14 both equal the barrier height @xmath24 and the basic frequency is @xmath25 . for phases",
    "@xmath6 around @xmath26 or @xmath27 two stable and one unstable orbits are present , whereas for @xmath22 or @xmath23 there is only one attractor located in either the left or in the right potential well of the static potential , respectively .",
    "the reason for this symmetry breaking is the interplay between the asymmetry of the harmonic mixing signal and the non - linearity of the quartic double - well potential .    for large signal amplitudes and arbitrary phase differences",
    ", there occurs only one stable periodic orbit which spreads over both potential wells ( not depicted ) .",
    "in view of our findings for the deterministic dynamics , we expect , that the noisy system exhibits sr similarly to that occurring in asymmetric potentials driven by sinusoidal signals @xcite . in order to check the former statement",
    "we have numerically solved the continuous fokker - planck model and developed an approximate treatment for in terms of a two - state model .    for small driving frequencies , i.e. for frequencies which are much smaller than the noise induced hopping rate ,",
    "the adiabatic potential modulation can be invoked . applying kramers rate formula @xcite for the transition rates among potential wells we find to leading order in the driving amplitudes @xcite the results : @xmath28 wherein @xmath29 is the kramers rate of the unperturbed symmetric system , i.e. @xmath30 . the occupation probabilities @xmath31 for the two states @xmath17 obey the following master equation @xcite : @xmath32 due to normalization of probabilities ,",
    "i.e. @xmath33 , the differential equation for the mean value ( @xmath34 ) reads @xmath35 { \\langle x(t ) \\rangle}+ k_{+}(t ) -    k_{-}(t)\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming @xmath36 and @xmath37 the asymptotic , periodic long time solution of eq .   can be expanded beyond linear response into a series with respect to the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "next , in order to identify higher harmonics , we expand @xmath40 into a fourier series : @xmath41 with corresponding fourier coefficients @xmath42 and phase lags @xmath43 .",
    "the spectral amplification factors @xmath44 , which are defined as ratio of the output power stored at the corresponding higher harmonic driving frequency to the input power , are given by @xmath45      we start our discussion with the zeroth order fourier coefficient @xmath46 , namely the time- and noise averaged mean value .",
    "this nonlinear response reads in leading order : @xmath47 please note that generally @xmath46 differs from zero .",
    "this is so , because the unbiased , but asymmetric input signal , possessing particularly nonvanishing time - averaged odd numbered higher moments @xmath48 dynamically breaks the symmetry of the system @xcite . for illustration",

    "[ fig : meanvalue](a ) . at an optimum noise level @xmath9 the accumulation in one state is extremal . similar to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance",
    ", this effect manifests itself by a synchronization of noise - activated hopping events between the two metastable states and the driving force @xmath4 .     of the nonlinear response of the two - state system driven by a harmonic mixing signal with amplitudes @xmath51 , fundamental frequency @xmath52 and phase differences @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
