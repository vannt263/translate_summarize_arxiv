    "present data from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments favour the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations .",
    "nevertheless , this interpretation requires confirmation from further experiments , in particular from laboratory experiments .",
    "all solar neutrino experiments @xcite find less @xmath5 than predicted theoretically .",
    "however , the uncertainties in the calculation of the solar neutrino flux may still be rather large @xcite and new experiments @xcite are being planned to further investigate the possible origin of the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "as for atmospheric neutrino experiments , two of them @xcite measure a ratio @xmath6 smaller than expected from theoretical calculations . here ,",
    "in addition to the uncertainties on the estimation of the atmospheric neutrino flux and on the neutrino - nucleon cross section @xcite , one has to add the uncertainties due to the modest data sample .",
    "new experiments are also being planned in this area @xcite .",
    "a complementary approach is to look for neutrino oscillations in laboratory experiments , where the experimental conditions , in particular the shape , energy , and flux of the neutrino beam are under control .",
    "a number of neutrino experiments have recently started taking data .",
    "these are the lsnd experiment at los alamos @xcite , which looks for @xmath7 oscillations , and the chorus @xcite and nomad @xcite experiments at cern , which are primarily sensitive to @xmath8 oscillations .",
    "recent data from lsnd may be consistent with the existence of neutrino oscillations @xcite , although no formal claim has been made so far by the collaboration .",
    "first results from chorus and nomad should be available in 1996 .",
    "in addition , a number of new @xmath9 oscillation experiments are being discussed . at fermilab , a new",
    ", very intense @xmath10 beam is planned to be available around the year 2001 .",
    "two complementary experiments are being discussed to benefit from this beam .",
    "these are e803 @xcite , a short - baseline experiment similar in design to chorus , and minos @xcite , a long - baseline experiment , which proposes to detect the neutrinos produced at fermilab with a @xmath11 kton detector located in the soudan mine , around 730 km away from the neutrino source .",
    "furthermore , new experimental techniques are being studied to upgrade nomad and chorus @xcite .",
    "ultimately , these new techniques could result in the design of new detectors able to improve the performance of nomad and chorus / e803 by one order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "such detector(s ) could be operated either at cern or at fermilab beams .    in this paper",
    "we examine the prospects of success of all these experiments in the light of present data . chorus and nomad",
    "were conceived at a time when the dominant scenario for neutrino masses was consistent with very light @xmath5 , @xmath12 and a @xmath13 of about @xmath11 ev constituting the hot component of the dark matter .",
    "this scenario arose as the most natural solution to explain the solar neutrino problem , simultaneously providing a candidate for the hot dark matter .",
    "however , present data no longer favour this simple scenario . indeed , explaining the results from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments in the usual three - neutrino framework is very difficult and requires a large degree of fine - tuning .",
    "one has to choose between throwing away part of the data and considering a larger scheme .",
    "the  minimal \" scheme to explain @xmath1 data without fine - tuning seems to be a four - neutrino framework @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a sterile neutrino . using this framework we perform a consistent analysis of the data from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as results on neutrino - oscillation laboratory experiments .",
    "this analysis enables us to re - assess the discovery potential of chorus and nomad as well as to study the prospects for the new experiments discussed above .",
    "we find that chorus and nomad have a rather marginal chance of discovering @xmath16 oscillations .",
    "however , the future @xmath13 oscillation experiments have much better prospects since they cover a very large fraction of the oscillation parameter space .",

    "there are two types of laboratory experiments to search for neutrino oscillations . in a disappearance experiment one",

    "a neutrino beam will be available when the main injector becomes operational , around the year 2001 .",
    "compared with the cern sps beam , the main injector will deliver a beam 50 times more intense , but with an average energy around one third of that of the sps neutrinos @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fluxes ] ) .",
    "there are currently two experiments proposed to operate in this beam .",
    "one is a short - baseline experiment , e803 @xcite , very similar in design and fiducial mass to chorus .",
    "nevertheless , e803 is foreseen to have a sensitivity ten times better than chorus , thanks essentially to a much larger data sample ( in addition to a more intense beam , the experiment expects a 4-year run ) .",
    "minos @xcite is a long - baseline experiment , which proposes two detectors , separated by 732 km .",
    "this experiment can perform several tests to look for a possible oscillation @xmath3 in the small mass difference range . of those ,",
    "the most sensitive is the comparison of the fraction of cc - like ( defined for @xmath12 ) and nc - like events ( a @xmath13 event , appears , except for the decay @xmath160 as a neutral current in the minos detector ) .",
    "the main characteristics and expected performance of e803 and minos are summarized in table [ tab : e803 ] .",
    "finally we will consider the possibility of installing the nausicaa detector ( see table [ tab : nausicaa ] ) as an alternative or a successor to e803 in the fermilab beam .",
    "we now turn to the study of the prospects for the discovery of @xmath13 oscillations in the upcoming cern experiments chorus and nomad , in the future experiment e803 at fermilab as well as a possible improved experiment , nausicaa , operated both at cern and fermilab beam . as an example of long - baseline experiment we also analyse the prospects for minos .    after implementing the limits derived in sec .",
    "[ global ] and considering the sensitivity of the experiments , one sees that for all facilities the only observable @xmath161 transition oscillates with an oscillation length @xmath131 such that @xmath162 figure [ etau ] shows the regions accessible to the experiments in the @xmath163 plane .",
    "as can be seen , the almost complete accessible range of parameters for the cern experiments chorus and nomad is already excluded by the bugey data in the favoured range for the mass difference due to dark matter considerations .",
    "e803 at fermilab and nausicaa at cern could observe these oscillations in the whole favoured range of @xmath164 , provided that @xmath165 .",
    "furthermore , nausicaa operated at the fermilab beam can go as low as @xmath166 .",
    "minos , being a @xmath12 disappearance experiment is not sensitive to this oscillation .    for transitions @xmath45",
    "a four - neutrino framework predicts ( unlike the naive two - family framework ) @xmath167 oscillations , dominated by the characteristic lengths @xmath131 and @xmath122 .",
    "all experiments are in principle sensitive to both oscillations depending on the values of the mixing angles @xmath168    in fig .",

    "e803 and nausicaa at cern can marginally see this oscillation in the favoured range for @xmath164 for maximum @xmath117 mixing .",
    "in particular if the lsnd data are confirmed , this oscillation could be observable at both experiments for this optimum value of the @xmath117 mixing .",
    "for smaller values of the @xmath117 mixing these oscillations became very marginal or invisible .",
    "nausicaa at fermilab can observe this oscillation for @xmath171@xmath172 .",
    "if the lsnd results are confirmed , the same oscillation could then be detected in nausicaa at fermilab , provided @xmath173 .",
    "as seen in the figure the accessible range for minos is already excluded by the e776 data .",
    "figure [ mutauat ] shows the region accessible to the experiments in the @xmath174 parameter space for different values of the other mixings . as seen in the figure",

    "[ mutauat].a ) .",
    "it must be pointed out , however , that cern experiments can observe this oscillation very marginally only . for larger values of the @xmath117 mixing",
    "the situation is almost the same as long as the @xmath116 mixing remains zero .",
    "if both mixings take their maximum allowed value the whole parameter space for the cern experiments is ruled out by the atmospheric and e776 experiments data ( see fig .",

    "in this paper we have studied the discovery potential of laboratory experiments searching for the oscillation @xmath16 , after considering existing data on solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments as well as the results from laboratory experiments on neutrino oscillations . to understand all these results in a common framework ,",
    "we have introduced a fourth sterile neutrino and we have performed a comprehensive reanalysis of the data in this four - neutrino scenario . as an outcome of this analysis",
    "we can predict the number of expected events at future @xmath13 oscillations experiments at cern and fermilab for the allowed oscillation parameters . we find that at these facilities @xmath161 oscillations are dominated by mass differences of the order of @xmath178@xmath11 ev@xmath50 while @xmath179 oscillations could occur with both @xmath119 and @xmath180@xmath181 ev@xmath50 .",
    "our predictions are rather pessimistic for the upcoming experiments nomad and chorus , which , we find , are able to explore only a small area of the oscillation parameter space in both @xmath161 and @xmath45 channels .",
    "the prospects are much better for future @xmath13 experiments .",
    "e803 and/or an improved detector ( nausicaa ) at cern can explore @xmath161 with @xmath182 .",
    "as for @xmath45 , the oscillations with @xmath119 could be observed at e803/nausicaa - cern in the range favoured by the lsnd results , while oscillations with @xmath118 are accessible for mixing values allowed by the atmospheric neutrino data if @xmath183 ev@xmath50 .",
    "the proposed long - baseline experiment minos at fermilab has the unique potential of completely exploring the region dominated by @xmath118 thus , if present atmospheric neutrino data are correct minos @xmath184 observe the oscillation @xmath3 . finally , a future high - performance detector such as nausicaa at fermilab could have the potential of exploring a very sizeable region of the parameter space for all the oscillation modes .",
    "the @xmath185 , oscillations could be detected in the limit @xmath186 and @xmath187 ev@xmath50 ; @xmath3 oscillations dominated by @xmath164 could be detected in the limit @xmath188 and @xmath189 ev@xmath190 and @xmath191 oscillations dominated by @xmath118 could be detected in the limit @xmath192 and maximal mixing . indeed , nausicaa has the potential to observe @xmath2 @xmath3 and @xmath185 oscillations .",
