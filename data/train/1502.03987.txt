    "there has been enormous interest in investigating the switching of the magnetization of a nanomagnet by the spin - polarized electric current or by the electric field as possible routes to increasing computer speed .",
    "spin transfer torque random access memory ( stt - ram ) devices have been successfully engineered as cache memory and have entered the market .",
    "large effort has been developed to achieve fast switching of the magnetic moment by the electric field in magnets interfaced with piezoelectric materials and in multiferroic systems @xcite .",
    "this latter task is difficult to achieve due the linear relation , @xmath1 , between the magnetic moment @xmath2 and the electric field @xmath3 is prohibited by symmetry .",
    "it prompted researchers to look for , e.g. , @xmath4-degree rotation of the magnetization through the effect of the electric field on the magnetic anisotropy , or consider combined effects of the electric field and the exchange bias in layered systems .    in this paper",
    "we propose a nanoelectromechanical system ( nems ) for switching of the magnetic moment by the electric field that is based upon a different principle .",
    "it follows from the observation that symmetry permits linear relation between @xmath2 and the angular velocity @xmath5 of the rotation .",
    "the latter can be generated by a pulse of the electric field applied to a multiferroic particle attached to a torsional cantilever , or by the electric field pulse applied to a ferroelectric cantilever containing a magnetic particle . according to the larmor theorem , in the coordinate frame of a nanomagnet ,",
    "torsional vibrations are equivalent to the ac magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the latter is known to be capable of switching the magnetic moment , see , e.g. , ref . and references therein .",
    "the advantage of mechanical vibrations over the ac magnetic field is that they can be localized at the nanoscale .",
    "this permits miniaturization down to molecular dimensions as has been demonstrated by recent measurements of a single molecular spin in a nems obtained by grafting of a single - molecule magnet on a carbon nanotube @xcite .     and",
    "electric polarization @xmath6 is a part of a torsional oscillator rotating about the @xmath7 axis .",
    "the system is placed inside a pair of capacitors .",
    "the reversal of the magnetic moment is generated by pulse voltages , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , on the capacitors.,width=340 ]    coupling of mechanical vibrations to the magnetization of a thin film deposited on a small cantilever has been studied before @xcite . in a multidomain magnetic film",
    "it is related to the motion of domain walls @xcite . in a single - domain system",
    "the magnetomechanical magnetization reversal was shown to have strong sensitivity to the parameters @xcite .",
    "the concept of spin - rotation coupling sheds new light on the origin of the observed stochasticity .",
    "circularly polarized ac field switches the magnetic moment in a predictable manner via the consecutive absorption of photons of one helicity ( i.e. , one spin projection ) while a linearly polarized field consists of photons of different helicity that are absorbed intermittently , raising or decreasing the corresponding projection of the magnetic moment .",
    "although torsional vibrations can not be reduced to either linear or circular polarized ac field , understanding of how the ac field reverses the magnetic moment @xcite allows one to design the optimal geometry in which rotations induced by the electric field can do the job .",
    "the equivalence of mechanical rotations to the ac magnetic field in the rotating frame makes the problem of the electromechanical magnetization reversal uniquely defined and free of any unknown coupling constants .",
    "interaction of the magnetic moment with torsional oscillations is completely determined by the larmor theorem and by the dynamics of the total angular momentum @xcite , spin plus mechanical , in the presence of the mechanical torque generated by the electric field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system under consideration and the model are described in section [ model ] where dynamical equations for the magnetic moment and mechanical rotations caused by the time - dependent electric field are derived .",
    "numerical solution of the equations and switching phase diagrams are presented in section [ numerical ] .",
    "estimates for real systems and possible applications of our results are discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider the system schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "magnetic energy of the uniaxial ferromagnetic particle in its own coordinate frame is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnetic anisotropy constant , @xmath12 is the volume of the particle , @xmath13 is the magnetic field in the frame of the particle , and @xmath14 is its constant - length magnetization .",
    "the body - frame @xmath15-axis in this formula coincides with the easy magnetization direction .",
    "the particle is allowed to rotate mechanically around the @xmath7-axis , with @xmath16 being the angle that the easy axis makes in the @xmath17-plane with the stationary @xmath15 direction in the laboratory frame .",
    "we shall assume that , in addition to the magnetic moment , the system also possesses the electric polarization characterized by the vector @xmath6 directed along the anisotropy axis of the particle .",
    "this can be achieved by either using a composite multiferroic material or by interfacing the magnet with the ferroelectric .",
    "interaction of the electric polarization with the crystal lattice , being of coulomb origin , is strong , providing that the orientation of the particle in space follows the orientation of @xmath6 . on the contrary ,",
    "interaction of @xmath2 with the mechanical rotation of the particle is of the relativistic spin - orbit origin .",
    "consequently , the magnetization vector does not necessarily follow the rotations of the anisotropy axis if the latter are sufficiently fast .",
    "mechanical rotation of the particle in our model is achieved due to the interaction of @xmath6 with the electric field @xmath3 , @xmath18 no interaction of @xmath2 with @xmath6 in addition to the magnetic anisotropy is assumed . the effective coupling between @xmath2 and @xmath3 is provided by the rotation of the magnetic anisotropy axis that follows the direction of @xmath6 .",
    "the easiest way to take this effect into account is by noticing that according to the larmor theorem the rotation with the angular velocity @xmath19 generates the effective magnetic field @xmath20 in the coordinate frame of the rotating particle . in what follows",
    "we shall assume that no external magnetic field is applied .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath21 is the only field felt by the particle in its own coordinate frame .",
    "while the easy magnetization axis in our model follows the direction of the electric polarization @xmath6 , the latter does not necessarily follow the direction of the electric field @xmath3 because of the finite moment of inertia of the rotator .",
    "we shall now proceed to the derivation of coupled equations for the magnetic moment and mechanical rotation caused by the application of the time - dependent electric field .",

    "it is in the balpark of @xmath108mt , which is more than sufficient for magnetization reversal by the ac magnetic field @xcite , thus allowing for even weaker torsional oscillations than @xmath107 used in the estimate .",
    "the effect of the electric field on the oscillator is described by the electromechanical ratio @xmath109 .",

    "this gives voltages in the ballpark of a few volt .",
    "making such a device , while challenging , must be a doable task in the light of the recent progress in manufacturing nems .",
