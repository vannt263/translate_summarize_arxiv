    "perturbative calculations deal only with partons in the final state .",
    "however , hadrons and not partons are observed in the detector .",
    "the hadrons are the result of the fragmentation of the partons such that all the hadrons originating from a given parton are contained in a narrow region around the direction of the original parton , what is commonly called a jet .",
    "therefore , the first step in comparing data and theory is to reconstruct the parton topology .",
    "this is best done with jet algorithms , which define the jets in a very specific way .",
    "the jets obtained display the following characteristics : _ ( i ) _ the longitudinal momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution of the hadrons in a jet should scale with the jet energy ; _ ( ii ) _ the transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) distribution of the hadrons should have a mean value of about 300 mev .",
    "thus , the mean angle ( @xmath2 ) between a hadron and the jet axis and the size of a cone which contains a constant fraction of energy will decrease with increasing jet energy . at high energies , this picture is modified since gluon emission from the original parton overcomes the fragmentation effects and so the structure of the jets is driven by radiation , which has the advantage of being calculable in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "thus , the investigation of the internal structure of jets gives insight into the transition between the parton produced in the hard process and the experimentally observed jet of hadrons .",
    "qcd predicts that _",
    "( i ) _ the jet substructure is driven by gluon emission off primary partons at sufficiently high jet transverse energy , @xmath3 , where fragmentation effects become negligible , _",
    "( ii ) _ jets originating from gluons are broader than those originating from quarks since the gluon - initiated jets radiate more due to their larger colour charge and _ ( iii ) _ the jet substructure depends mainly on the type of primary parton ( quark or gluon ) from which it originated and to a lesser extent on the hard scattering process .",
    "the experimental results from hera which confirm these predictions are presented in this report .",
    "the jet substructure can be studied in terms of two different observables , namely the jet shape  @xcite and the subjet multiplicity  @xcite .",
    "the jet shape is defined as the fraction of the jet transverse energy that lies inside a cone in the @xmath4 plane of radius @xmath5 , @xmath6 , concentric with the jet axis .",
    "the mean integrated jet shape is given by    @xmath7 to compute the jet shape , the jets can be reconstructed either with the cone  @xcite or the @xmath8  @xcite algorithms .",
    "in contrast , the subjet multiplicity can be computed using only the jets reconstructed with the @xmath8 algorithm and is obtained by reapplying the algorithm until for every pair of particles inside the jet , the quantity    @xmath9\\ ] ] is above @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the resolution parameter .",
    "the mean subjet multiplicity is given by    @xmath12    the calculations of the jet substructure using qcd - based leading - order ( lo ) monte carlo ( mc ) models , such as pythia  @xcite , herwig  @xcite , ariadne  @xcite and lepto  @xcite , are approximations based on a parton - shower approach .",
    "in fixed - order qcd calculations , the lowest order provides no structure for the jets since there is only one parton inside a jet .",
    "higher - order terms give the lowest non - trivial contribution to the jet substructure .",
    "in particular , it is possible to obtain next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations for jet substructure in neutral current ( nc ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) in the laboratory frame from @xmath13 predictions since , in this case , three partons can be inside one jet .",
    "thus , measurements of jet substructure provide a stringent test of pqcd directly beyond lo .",
    "the pqcd calculations of the jet shape and subjet multiplicity are obtained via    @xmath14 @xmath15}{\\sigma_{\\rm jet}(\\etjet)}\\ ] ]    @xmath16 @xmath17",
    "at hera , the main source of jets is photoproduction . at lo qcd",
    ", two processes contribute to the jet production cross section , resolved , in which the photon interacts via its partonic structure , and direct processes , in which the photon interacts as a point - like particle .",
    "both processes give rise to two jets in the final state .",
    "the observable @xmath18 measures the energy invested by the photon in producing the dijet system and can be used to separate resolved and direct processes since they populate different regions of phase space . resolved processes give rise to jets of quarks and gluons in the final state . on the other hand ,",
    "direct processes are dominated by quark jets , so the @xmath19 dependence of the jet substructure is expected to show quark - like jets in the rear direction and gluon - like jets in the proton direction due to hera dynamics , since for the dominant resolved diagram ( @xmath20 ) , the gluon goes forward . on the other hand ,",
    "the jets in an inclusive - jet sample of nc or charged current ( cc ) dis processes are dominated by quark jets so that no significant dependence with @xmath19 is expected . only for a dijet sample , which contains a larger fraction of gluon jets , some dependence with @xmath19 could be observed .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the mean integrated jet shape as a function of @xmath5 for different regions of @xmath19 .",
    "the jets become broader as @xmath19 increases .",
    "the comparison with the qcd - based mc calculations shows that models with only fragmentation predict jets that are too narrow compared to the data . in contrast , models which include initial- and final - state qcd radiation describe the data well for @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , parton radiation is the dominant mechanism responsible for the jet shape .",
