    "accretion models for the formation of the terrestrial planets need to reproduce the following properties of our solar system .",
    "( 1 ) the spatial mass distribution of the terrestrial planets is radially concentrated .",
    "namely , the earth and venus contain most of the mass inside of jupiter s orbit , whereas the masses of mars and mercury are an order of magnitude smaller than the earth s mass ( @xmath4 ) and the total mass of asteroids is only @xmath5 @xmath4 . the orbital separation between earth and venus is only 0.3 au .",
    "( 2 ) the orbits of the earth and venus are nearly circular and coplanar even though orbital excitements are expected in the late stage of accretion where large protoplanets experience mutual collisions .",
    "this probably indicates that there were some damping mechanisms to reduce their orbital eccentricities and inclinations near the end of their formation processes .",
    "( 3 ) isotope records such as w / hf and u / pb for the earth and moon indicate that the moon - forming giant impact occurred @xmath6 myr after the beginning of the solar system ( touboul et al . , 2007 ;",
    "allgre et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "some accretion models can reproduce two of the three properties but there is no accretion model that satisfies all three properties .",
    "@xmath0-body simulations that follow only the gravitational interactions of protoplanets ( or with the giant planets ) usually produce too large orbital eccentricities of the final planets ( chambers , 1998 ; agnor et al . , 1999 ;",
    "raymond et al . , 2004 ; kokubo et al . ,",
    "2006 ) . to resolve this issue two damping mechanisms have been proposed : one is by remnant planetesimals ( chambers , 2001 ; obrien et al . , 2006 ; raymond et al . , 2006 , 2009 ; morishima et al . , 2008 ) and",
    "another is by remnant nebular gas ( agnor and ward , 2002 ; kominami et al . , 2002 , 2004 ;",
    "nagasawa et al . , 2005 ;",
    "ogihara et al . , 2007 ; thommes et al . ,",
    "2008 ) .    in particular , the dynamical shake - up model of nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and thommes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is the most successful model so far in reproducing both the small orbital eccentricities and the radial mass concentration .",
    "their model initially places a few tens of protoplanets embedded in a gas disk and takes into account the effect of the gas giant planets with orbital eccentricities comparable to or slightly larger than the present values ( the present eccentricities of both jupiter and saturn are @xmath7 0.05 ) .",
    "the secular resonance with jupiter migrates from @xmath74.0 to 0.6 au with dissipation of the gas disk and sweeps protoplanets toward the current location of the earth .",
    "mutual impacts between protoplanets occur even when a large amount of gas remains , and the remnant gas disk reduces the orbital eccentricities of formed earth - like planets .    if the formation of the moon occurred very late , as indicated by recent isotope measurements ( touboul et al . , 2007 ) , significant damping due to remnant gas may be problematic for the following reasons .",
    "significant depletion of gas already at @xmath7 10 myr is suggested from direct measurements of line emissions of circumstellar disks ( pascucci et al .",
    "2006 ) and from h@xmath8 emission profiles of central stars due to accretion shock ( muzerolle et al . , 2000 ) , although we can not rule out the possibility that our protosolar nebular was exceptionally long - lived .",
    "another potential problem for long - lived gas disks is depletion of the solid component due to type i migration , which is neglected in the model of nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and thommes et al .",
    "once a protoplanet becomes as massive as mars in a gas disk , the gravitational torque from spiral density waves launched by the protoplanet causes rapid inward migration of the protoplanet , referred to as type i migration ( goldreich and tremaine , 1980 ; ward , 1986 , 1997 ; tanaka et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "mcneil et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and daisaka et al .",
    "( 2006 ) conducted @xmath0-body simulations taking type i migration into account and found that the decay time scale for a gas disk needs to be @xmath9 myr in order to retain sufficient solid mass for the formation of earth - size planets .",
    "some remnant planetesimals are likely to have existed even at 100 myr particularly in the asteroidal region .",
    "several authors have conducted @xmath0-body simulations starting with protoplanets and remnant planetesimals ( chambers , 2001 ; chambers and cassen , 2002 ; obrien et al . 2006 ; raymond et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 ) .",
    "their results show that final eccentricities of planets tend to be lower with increasing total mass of remnant planetesimals .",
    "even with the same total mass of planetesimals , the damping is more effective when the size of an individual planetesimal is smaller and planetesimals are placed uniformly over both the terrestrial and asteroidal regions rather than in the asteroidal region only ( obrien et al . , 2006 ; raymond et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "an eccentricity of jupiter comparable to or slightly larger than the present value is preferred in regard to the radial mass concentration ( chambers and cassen , 2002 ; obrien et al . , 2006 ; raymond et al . , 2009 ) , although none of simulations have succeeded in reproducing the very high radial mass concentration of the current terrestrial planets .",
    "the spatial and size distributions of remnant planetesimals are arbitrarily assumed in these simulations . in order to clarify these distributions",
    "one needs to follow the growth of planetesimals and protoplanets in the runaway growth stage .",
    "in addition , the above simulations neglect the effects of gas .",
    "the protosolar nebular must have existed at least until the formation of jupiter , and probably survived somewhat longer .",
    "even a rapid dissipation of gas of the order of 0.1 myr in the presence of jupiter strongly affects the orbital evolution of asteroidal bodies ( nagasawa et al . , 2000 ) .    in the present study",
    "we perform @xmath0-body simulations starting with a wide planetesimal disk and continue until the end of the accretion phase .",
    "since we directly calculate the runaway growth of the protoplanets , we can obtain reasonable spatial and size distributions of remnant planetesimals in the late stage .",
    "we take into account the gas giant planets and all the possible effects of gas in laminar disks : aerodynamic gas drag , disk - planet interaction including type i migration , and global disk potential . in a previous study ,",
    "morishima et al . ( 2008 ) also conducted @xmath0-body simulations that followed the evolution of a protoplanetary disk starting with planetesimals only until the end of accretion .",
    "however , their simulations started from radially narrow annuli ( widths of 0.3 - 0.5 au ) and neglected any external forces . in sec .  2",
    ", we introduce our new @xmath0-body code , review the effects of nebular gas , and outline our choice of simulation parameters . in sec .  3",
    ", we show time evolution of two contrasting examples , present the results of all simulations and compare them with the solar system . in principle , none of our simulations succeed in satisfying all the three constraints listed in the first paragraph of this section . in sec .  4",
    ", we discuss possible solutions for this problem . in sec .  5 , we give our conclusions .",
    "any @xmath0-body code consists of a gravity solver to calculate the mutual gravity force and an integrator to update positions and velocities for a next time step .",
    "existing @xmath0-body codes applied for the runaway growth stage have good gravity solvers , such as tree methods ( richardson et al . , 2000 ; stadel , 2001 ) or special hardware such as harp or grape ( kokubo and ida , 1996 ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath0-body codes applied for the late stage have good integrators , such as symba ( duncan et al . , 1998 ) and mercury ( chambers , 1999 ) , so that one can take a large time step size , while solving the mutual gravity by direct @xmath10 calculation .",
    "the new @xmath0-body code we have developed has both a good gravity solver and a good integrator , allowing us to follow accretion stages of planetary systems with large @xmath0 and over a large number of orbits . the code is still being upgraded and details of the complete version will be reported elsewhere . here",
    "we briefly describe the version of the code used for simulations in this paper .",
    "the gravity solver we use is a parallel - tree method , pkdgrav ( stadel , 2001 ) .",
    "the original version of pkdgrav uses a leap - frog integration scheme , where individual particles are updated in hierarchical time step blocks , each block with a factor of two smaller time - step according to the local dynamical time of its particles .",
    "richardson et al . ( 2000 ) added some functions for planetary accretion to the code and conducted simulations for the runaway growth stage . in the tree method ,",
    "all particles are divided into hierarchal tree - structured groups .",
    "then , the gravity forces from distant particle groups are calculated using their multipole expansions .",
    "the zeroth - order multipole expansion corresponds to the gravity from the mass center of a particle group . in order to keep good accuracy",
    ", we include multipole expansions up to the fourth order .",
    "the computer time of gravity calculation using this gravity solver is only proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "we find a significant speed up in the gravity calculation with our tree method as compared with the direct @xmath10 calculation when @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , the tree method is suitable for parallel computing , and this results in further speed up when @xmath13 .",
    "since the number of particles decreases with growth of planets , we switch calculation methods from parallel - tree to serial - tree , and to serial - direct @xmath10 calculations . the error in the total energy due to the tree method appears as a random walk , and thus is proportional to the square root of the number of time steps .",
    "therefore , with some short additional simulations , we can estimate the accumulated error after a long term evolution of a system .",
    "the accuracy of the method is controlled by the opening angle for tree cells and we set it to be 0.5 in the present paper .",
    "we confirm that the expected error due to the gravity calculation is sufficiently smaller than the error due to the integrator s , which rises most notably during close encounters .",
    "the integrator implemented in the code is a mixed - variable symplectic ( mvs ) integrator , symba ( duncan et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "in mvs integrators such as symba and mercury , the hamiltonian is split into a part which describes the keplerian motion around the central star and another part which describes the perturbation from other bodies . the former part corresponds to updates of positions and velocities along kepler orbits .",
    "this can be done nearly analytically .",
    "the latter part corresponds to velocity changes due to the perturbation from other bodies , which we calculate using the tree method described above .",
    "these types of integrators are very accurate and allow us to take very large time steps for long term simulations .",
    "we use a time step size , @xmath14 , of 6 days .",
    "this is comparable to those used in previous high - resolution @xmath0-body simulations using mvs integrators ( obrien et al . , 2006 ; raymond et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "practically , the time step size needs to be chosen so that a fraction of particles in close encounters defined below is small enough .    in close encounter search , we first search for 1020 nearest neighbors of each particle using the same algorithm in the tree sph code , gasoline ( wadsley et al . , 2004 ) . with the relative velocities and positions at the beginning and end of a time step",
    ", the closest distance of a pair during the step is calculated using a third order interpolation ( eq .",
    "( 11 ) of chambers , 1999 ) . in order to judge whether a particle is in a close encounter or",
    "not , we first define the critical distance for each particle .",
    "the critical distance is defined as the larger of ( 1 ) @xmath15 or ( 2 ) @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are numerical factor ( we use @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is the hill radius , and @xmath22 is the epicyclic velocity of the particle with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 being the kepler velocity , eccentricity , and inclination , respectively . if the closest distance of a pair is smaller than the sum of the critical distances , we regard this pair to be in a close encounter . in the original symba code",
    "( duncan et al . , 1998 ) , only the first condition is used .",
    "however , the second condition is necessary if the relative velocity is much larger than the mutual escape velocity ; such encounters usually occur near resonances of the giant planets or between small planetesimals stirred by large protoplanets . in the mercury code",
    "( chambers , 1999 ) , the second condition uses the largest @xmath23 in all particles instead of each body s @xmath26 which we apply .",
    "although this criterion of the mercury code gives better energy conservation ( for a same @xmath18 ) , it also results in too many pairs being identified as involved in close encounters during the runaway growth stage , where the number density of particles is large .",
    "if the number density is not large , as is the case in the late stage , use of the mercury s criterion is recommended ( although we do not use it even in the late stage in this paper ) .",
    "all the above computations are performed in parallel ( if @xmath13 ) , while particles in close encounters are collected on a single cpu during the domain decomposition ; the procedure which distributes the workload , and hence the remaining particles , amongst processors .",
    "then , multistep time stepping is done until all particles proceed to the end of the original time step , following the procedure described in duncan et al .",
    "the closest mutual distance in a substep is always estimated by interpolation using the information of both the beginning and the end of the step .",
    "this guarantees time symmetry of the integrator which is essential to avoid secular errors .",
    "the computational time for the substep procedure is small enough as it is simply proportional to the number of particles in close encounters .",
    "we set the ratio of the cut - off radius to that of the next order to be 2.08 and the number of next order substeps in the current substep to be 3 after duncan et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we assume that two bodies merge when they partially overlap .",
    "we assume the density of particles to be 2 g @xmath27 .",
    "since we do not apply the artificial enhancement of radii ( kokubo and ida , 2002 , morishima et al .",
    ", 2008 ) , the accretion time scale we will show is realistic .",
    "a particle is assumed to collide with the sun when either the heliocentric distance is less than 0.1 au or the semimajor axis is less than 0.25 au .",
    "a particle is assumed to escape from the system when the heliocentric distance is larger than 100 au .",
    "the energy error after completion of accretion is typically @xmath28@xmath29 .",
    "note that energy changes due to merging or gas forces can be explicitly calculated and are subtracted in the above error .",
    "the largest portion of the error usually accumulates after the runaway growth stage where a large number of excited small particles experience mutual encounters .",
    "therefore , the energy error primarily depends on how long small particles survive .      in this section",
    ", we review the forces due to the nebular gas .",
    "the acceleration due to the gas is incorporated in the integrator by placing the half kicks before and after the kepler drift operation .",
    "this symmetric placement once again avoids secular errors coming from the inclusion of gas forces .",

    "the growth rate of a protoplanet is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath24 is the orbital eccentricity of planetesimals , and the balance between viscous stirring by protoplanets and damping due to gas drag gives @xmath56 ( eq .  ( 25 ) of kokubo and ida , 2000 ) .",

    "therefore , the growth time scale of protoplanets will be significantly overestimated in our model . in order to reproduce the growth rate of protoplanets surrounded by small planetesimals ( @xmath60 ) ,",

    "the largest planet has 1.4 @xmath4 while both of other two have 0.3 @xmath4 .",
    "the locations of these three planets resemble those of the current terrestrial planets ( except we do not have a mercury analog ) , although the masses are somewhat different .",

    "if the orbits of the gas giant planets are nearly circular , the effects of the secular resonances are much weaker than the case of the ejs orbits .",
    "consequently , a large fraction of particles stay in the asteroidal region for a long period of time",
    ". nevertheless , the orbital eccentricities of the gas giant planets can not be completely zero when there are two ( or more ) gas giant planets .",
    "therefore , resonances gradually sculpture orbits of particles in the asteroidal region .",
    "some enhancements at the 3:1 mean motion resonance ( 2.6 au ) and the @xmath110 secular resonance ( 3.2 au ) are seen at 3 myr ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "these enhancements gradually propagate to non - resonant locations via mutual gravitational interactions ( raymond et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the mass transfer from the asteroidal region to the terrestrial region slowly occurs as excited asteroidal bodies encounter and collide with inner planets .    at 3 myr",
    ", there are about 15 mars - size protoplanets in the terrestrial region .",
    "the fraction of small particles is very small in the terrestrial region whereas small particles are still dominant in mass in the asteroidal region .",
    "this situation is similar to some of the initial conditions adopted in previous @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. , raymond et al .",
    ", 2006 ) . in our simulation , however , the mean orbital separation between protoplanets is @xmath7 20 hill radius at 3 myr while previous late stage simulations usually assume the orbital separation to be @xmath156 hill radius , based on the oligarchic growth model of kokubo and ida ( 1998 ) .",
    "the larger separation in our simulation is due to type i migration , which makes inner protoplanets start to migrate inward earlier than outer planets ( mcneil et al . , 2005 ) . with the large orbital separation and the orbital stabilization due to the nebular gas , mutual collisions between protoplanets are rare until @xmath7 10 myr .",
    "after 10 myr , mutual collisions between protoplanets start to occur , and the orbital separation increases as the number of protoplanets decreases . strictly speaking",
    ", the orbital separation normalized by the mutual hill radius , and averaged over pairs of planets , increases nearly logarithmically with time ( from @xmath157 at 3 myr to @xmath158 at 800 myr ) , and this is probably because the stable time scale of a planetary system exponentially increases with the normalized separation ( chambers et al .",
    ", 1996 ; ito and tanikawa , 1999 ; yoshinaga et al . , 1999 ) . through giant impacts , an earth - size planet forms slightly inside of 2 au .",
    "this planet highly enhances orbital eccentricities of asteroidal bodies and their number gradually decreases by either hitting this planet or escaping from the system after encounters with jupiter .",
    "there are still a large number of remnant planetesimals at 100 myr , but not at 300 myr ( figs .  5 and 6 ) .",
    "therefore , damping due to planetesimals is expected until giant impacts complete at around 100 myr . in this simulation ,",
    "the last potentially moon - forming impact occurs at 139.5 myr on the outermost planet ( fig .",
    "nevertheless , the mean orbital eccentricity in the end of the simulation ( @xmath7 800 myr ) is not small , as the two middle planets are still strongly interacting ( fig .",
    "these two planets are stirred by the innermost and outermost planets which have larger masses than the middle planets .",
    "this simulation succeeded in reproducing the very late giant impact , but failed to reproduce the nearly circular orbits and the radial mass concentration of the current system .      in this section",
    ", we examine the properties of planetary systems formed in all runs and compare them with those for our own system .",
    "we consider the following three properties of systems ( see also raymond et al . , 2009 ) .    1 .   the spatial mass distribution .",
    "the radial mass concentration statistic , @xmath159 , is defined as ( chambers , 2001 ) @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the mass and the semimajor axis of each planet , and the subscript @xmath163 is given in the order of @xmath162 .",
    "the function in the parenthesis is calculated for @xmath73 throughout the terrestrial planet region , with @xmath159 being the maximum value .",

    "the small content of iron in the moon is explained when the impact velocity is as slow as the mutual escape velocity ( canup , 2004 , 2008 ) ; this constraint will be also discussed ( figs .  13 and 16 ) .",
    "raymond et al . ( 2009 ) considered two additional constraints .",
    "the first one is the absence of planetary bodies ( @xmath181 @xmath4 ) in the asteroidal region ( @xmath1 2 au ) .",
    "they showed that bodies which are too massive destroy the observed radial variation of the asteroidal taxonomic types ( gradie and tedesco , 1982 ) .",
    "if massive bodies exist in the asteroidal region , this system usually has too large @xmath185 or too small @xmath159 , because we do not exclude a massive body in the asteroidal region to be defined as a planet .",
    "therefore , this constraint is automatically included in our first constraint .",
    "their second additional constraint is the earth s water content .",
    "they showed that the mass supply from asteroidal bodies to terrestrial planets decreases with increasing eccentricity of jupiter . as a result ,",
    "the water content of an earth - analog is insufficient in their ejs and eejs simulations . on the other hand , in our ejs and eejs simulations with the nebular gas ,",
    "a large fraction of mass of an earth - analog comes from the asteroidal region , while protoplanets which formed from planetesimals originally in the terrestrial region spiral into the sun by type i migration ( sec .",
    "probably , the problem here is rather that we need to consider how to remove excess water from our earth - analogs .",
    "the properties of the planetary systems from the ejs and cjs simulations are summarized in table  1 . also , figures  8 and 9 show the snapshots on the @xmath73-@xmath24 plane at the end of all ejs and cjs simulations , respectively . for both ejs and cjs simulations ,",
    "the total mass and the typical size of planets decrease with increasing gas decay time @xmath126 because of type i migration .",
    "when the surface density is large , protoplanets rapidly grow and then spiral into the sun",
    ". therefore , the final total mass @xmath186 depends on the initial surface density only weakly for a certain @xmath126 .",
    "this trend is particularly evident when @xmath187 myr , because the mass depletion due to type i migration propagates to the outer asteroidal region for large @xmath126 .",
    "the number of planets @xmath188 is usually 3 or 4 . in the ejs simulations with @xmath189 myr ,",
    "however , @xmath188 is smaller ; in these simulations , the @xmath109 resonance effectively sweeps most of the remnant mass to its current location ( 0.61au ) , and a planet with dominant mass ( @xmath190 @xmath4 ) forms there .",
    "we plot the final planets on the plane of semimajor axis versus mass ( fig .",
    "the crosses on the figure represent the current terrestrial planets .",
    "the ejs simulations clearly have better radial mass concentration than the cjs simulations . in the cjs simulations ,",

    "are smaller when the initial surface density in the asteroidal region is small , as is the case for small @xmath191 or large @xmath54 .",
    "in addition , for the ejs simulations , the radial mass concentration is indirectly affected by the initial spatial distribution of planetesimals via their interactions with jupiter .",
    "asteroidal particles reduce @xmath132 either by angular momentum exchange at the @xmath109 resonance or by energy exchange in close encounters with jupiter ; in both cases , the decrease in @xmath132 is given as @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is jupiter s mass .",
    "with decreasing @xmath132 , the effect of the @xmath109 resonance decreases ( nagasawa et al . , 2005 ) .",

    "such systems can obtain high radial mass concentration since jupiter s perturbation remains effective .",
    "this accounts for the large difference in the radial mass concentration between cases with @xmath194 and 10 @xmath4 in the ejs simulations ( fig .",
    "the @xmath110 resonance is also important for the radial mass concentration , and it also works effectively when @xmath134 is large ( we will discuss its effect at fig .",
    "17 more in detail ) . since saturn s eccentricity @xmath134",
    "is primarily determined by the eccentricity forced by jupiter , @xmath134 is usually comparable to or slightly larger than @xmath132 .",
    "figure  11 shows the plot of the final planets on the plane of mass versus orbital eccentricity .",
    "the small orbital eccentricities are well reproduced in the ejs simulations with @xmath116 @xmath4 but not in those with @xmath195 @xmath4 .",
    "this difference is closely related to the radial mass concentration . in the case with @xmath196 , the @xmath109 resonance effectively sweeps most of the bodies and giant impacts between protoplanets complete early while there remains a sufficient amount of gas and planetesimals . on the other hand , the systems starting with @xmath195 @xmath4",
    "radially expand even after the secular resonance passage and jupiter continuously perturbs the outer planets .",
    "these planets eventually trigger orbital instability and cause giant impacts after both gas and planetesimals significantly deplete .",
    "giant impacts tend to occur very late in the cjs simulations .",
    "however , small asteroidal bodies remain for a long time here as well and tend to damp eccentricities of the planets .",
    "this is why planets in cjs simulations have moderately small eccentricities both for @xmath116 and 10 @xmath4 . for the cjs simulations",
    ", we found a simple correlation between the mass weighted mean orbital eccentricity , @xmath197 and the mass weighted mean semimajor axis , @xmath185 ( fig .",
    "the longer the gas decay time , the larger @xmath185 , because mass depletion due to type i migration propagates outward with time .",
    "since jupiter perturbs outer planets more strongly than inner planets , we have this simple correlation",
    ". the cjs simulations always produce too large a value for @xmath185 , while the ejs simulations well reproduce the current value of @xmath185 except for runs with @xmath189 myr where @xmath185 becomes too small .",
    "figure  13 shows angular momenta and impact velocities of all potentially moon - forming impacts as functions of time .",
    "the most important result is that giant impacts occur most commonly at @xmath156 myr in the ejs simulations whereas at @xmath6 myr in the cjs simulations . in the ejs simulations ,",
    "some early giant impacts occur between protoplanets trapped in the @xmath109 resonance .",
    "it is more common , however , that giant impacts occur slightly later when orbital eccentricities of planets have sufficiently damped after passage of the resonance so that mutual gravitational attraction is enhanced . in the cjs simulations ,",
    "giant impacts usually occur after gas completely depletes and planetesimals in the asteroidal region also significantly ( but not completely ) deplete .",
    "the time of the last moon - forming impact in each simulation is shown in table  1 .",
    "in fact , last giant impacts in some of the ejs simulations occur very late .",
    "these systems , however , inevitably have either large eccentricities or low radial mass concentrations .    when we see a single simulation in fig .  13 , the impact velocity , @xmath198 , is as small as the mutual escape velocity @xmath199 at early time , but @xmath200 increases with time so that its value for the last impact is notably larger than unity .",
    "some simulations , however , have final impacts with @xmath201 , which is favorable for the small iron content of the moon ( canup , 2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "when the orbital separation of two planets , normalized by the mutual hill radius , slowly decreases due to their growth or weak perturbation from other planets , an impact between them with @xmath201 can occur after the jacobi integral in hill s equation slightly exceeds the potential at the hill s sphere .",
    "orbits of other protoplanets are affected only weakly during the time that two colliding protoplanets interact . on the other hand , if three or larger number of planets interact strongly , their relative velocity increases to the escape velocity . in this case , the typical impact velocity is @xmath202 .",
    "further higher @xmath203 are possible between small protoplanets stirred by larger planets or if jupiter s perturbation is strong .",
    "the former type of slow giant impacts usually occur in early stages while the latter type of high - velocity giant impacts occur after depletion of both gas and planetesimals ( fig .",
    "systems with @xmath172 and @xmath204 as small as those for the current system do not usually experience the latter type of impacts . therefore , not only the small orbital eccentricities of the earth and venus but also the small iron content of the moon are likely to support the presence of some damping forces at the time of the moon - forming impact .      as shown in table  1 , @xmath132 ( and @xmath134 ) decreases via interactions with particles in the asteroidal region .",
    "remnant planetesimals orbiting outside of jupiter s orbit may also reduce @xmath132 , although we do not include these bodies in our simulations .",
    "therefore , the initial @xmath132 and @xmath134 are likely to have been larger than those adopted in the ejs simulations , if their initial semimajor axes were ( nearly ) the same as the present values . on the other hand , if their initial semimajor axes were those given in the nice model , @xmath205 and @xmath206 might have been nearly zero throughout the terrestrial planet formation , but larger initial @xmath132 and @xmath134 are not excluded .",

    "clearly , the effect of jupiter s perturbation is more important if @xmath132 in the late stage is larger regardless of initial values of @xmath132 . in fig .  18 , we plot the angular momentum deficit @xmath172 , the radial mass concentration parameter @xmath207 , and the time of the last one of potentially moon - forming impacts @xmath183 versus the value of @xmath132 at the end of a simulation , @xmath208 ( averaged over a few myr ) .",
    "we find that @xmath207 more appropriately represents the radial mass confinement than does @xmath159 because systems consisting of small planets with large @xmath73 tend to obtain large @xmath159 while @xmath209 is large ( particularly in the cjs simulations ) .",
    "simple linear @xmath210 fits suggest that @xmath207 and @xmath183 increases / decreases with @xmath208 , although the scatter of the simulation data are very large .",
    "the problem is that @xmath207 can be as large as the present value when @xmath208 is large whereas @xmath183 can be as large as that suggested from isotope records only when @xmath208 is small enough . for @xmath172",
    ", we fit the data with a quartic function as two competing effects are expected : large @xmath132 means stronger perturbation while quick accretion due to large @xmath132 means stronger damping forces due to remnant gas and planetesimals .",
    "we find that @xmath172 is nearly flat for small @xmath208 and increases with increasing @xmath211 when @xmath211 is larger than the present value . in an ensemble average sense , @xmath172 is usually much larger than the current value , although some simulations have @xmath172 consistent or even smaller than the present day value .",
    "the dependence of all three properties on @xmath208 is stronger for the cjs+cjsecc simulations than for the ejs+eejs simulations .",
    "it is unclear to us , however , whether this is really physically meaningful because fits for the cjs+cjsecc simulations are not very reliable with only a few points at large @xmath132 .",
    "none of our simulations succeeded in satisfying all of the three constraints listed in sec .  3.2 .",
    "the most serious issue we found is a trade - off between the radial mass concentration parameter , @xmath207 , and the time of the potentially moon - forming impact , @xmath183 ( the upper panel of fig .",
    "the large @xmath207 in the current system is due to the small masses of mars and mercury and the small orbital separation between the earth and venus .",
    "it is hard to satisfy both of these conditions in a system with large @xmath183 .",
    "since the evolution time scale is longer in the outer regions , giant impacts can occur late when a large amount of mass stays in the outer region for a long time .",
    "such a system usually has outer planets more massive than mars . also , if a planetary system slowly evolves with weak perturbations from jupiter ( e.g. , the cjs simulations ) , the orbital separation between neighboring planets normalized by the mutual hill radius inevitably becomes larger than that between the earth and venus ( 26.3 ) owing to the mutual orbital repulsion .",
    "if @xmath132 is as large as the present value or larger , @xmath207 can be as large as today s value because jupiter tends to radially compress a system .",
    "however , accretion completes too rapidly in such a case .",
    "there is also a trade - off between the angular momentum deficit @xmath172 and @xmath183 ( the lower panel of fig .",
    "namely , in order to obtain small @xmath172 , a final large impact needs to occur while some damping forces work effectively .",
    "otherwise , @xmath172 ends up with much larger than the current value .",
    "this trend is particularly clear for the ejs and cjs simulations ( filled and open circles ) .",
    "small @xmath172 even without any damping forces seems to be possible but such a case is statistically rare .",
    "our failure indicates that there may be some missing physics in our simulations or flaws with the assumptions that we have adopted . in the following ,",
    "we suggest three possible scenarios / solutions for future studies .    in the case with an eccentric jupiter ,",
    "a possible solution is that @xmath126 is much longer and type i migration is much slower than we assumed .",
    "this situation actually corresponds to that adopted in the original dynamical shake up model of nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and thommes et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in their simulations ( @xmath212 and 5 myr )",
    ", the giant impacts usually occur at @xmath213 @xmath126 when the @xmath109 resonance reaches near 1 au .",
    "therefore , @xmath214 myr is required for the late moon - forming impact indicated from isotope records ( @xmath215 50 myr ; touboul et al .",
    "if @xmath216 myr , the gas density is still @xmath217 of the minimum mass solar nebular at @xmath218 myr , and observations suggest that such a gas disk is exceptionally long - living ( pascucci et al .",
    "slightly smaller @xmath219 30 myr ) is not excluded from the terrestrial w / hf records only ( jacobsen et al . ,",
    "2009 ) , but this still requires a long - surviving disk ( @xmath220 myr ) .",
    "recent theories indicate significant changes in type i migration rate due to the non - isothermal effect ( baruteau and masset , 2008 ; paardekooper and mellema , 2008 ) and the non - linear effect of the co - rotation resonance ( masset et al . , 2006 ; paardekooper and paparoizou , 2009 ) .",
    "these mechanisms cause slow down of inward migration or even outward migration if the radial entropy gradient is negative for the former mechanism or if the radial surface density gradient is nearly flat or positive for the latter one .",
    "therefore , if a local density maximum exists , planetary migration slows down or protoplanets even tend to migrate toward this point ( kretke et al .",
    ", 2009 ) . a local density maximum can exist at the boundary between the optically thin inner region and the optically thick outer region ( i.e. , the inner boundary of the so - called dead - zone ; kretke and lin , 2007 ; brauer et al . , 2008 ) .",
    "protoplanets might have survived in the protosolar nebular for a long time with such mechanisms .    an alternative possibility for the case with an eccentric jupiter",
    "is that the nebular gas inside of jupiter might have dissipated very rapidly after the formation of jupiter .",
    "this situation corresponds to previous @xmath0-body simulations for the late stages without gas ( chambers , 2001 ; obrien et al . , 2006 ; raymond et al . , 2009 ) . without gas",
    ", @xmath183 tends to be larger than those in our simulations , because the effect of @xmath109 is less signifiant .",
    "non - uniform gas dissipation models , such as inside - out and gap - opening models discussed in nagasawa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , probably have similar outcomes , because @xmath109 passes a certain location after the gas dissipates there .",
    "raymond et al . ( 2009 ) showed that some of their eejs simulations nearly satisfy all the three constraints listed in sec .",
    "in fact , these simulations satisfy the small mass of mars , but not the small orbital separation between the earth and venus .",
    "this is why the values of @xmath159 in all of their simulations are smaller than the current value .",
    "this problem might be resolved , however , if they adopt even higher resolution with smaller planetesimals ( e.g. , morishima et al . ,",
    "2008 ) and inelastic rebounds for high - speed or grazing collisions ( agnor and asphau , 2004 ; asphau et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "because these effects are likely to enhance the damping effects and reduce the orbital excursions of planets , the orbital separation between neighboring planets will probably be smaller .",
    "very quick or non - uniform dissipation of gas seems to be favorable , at least , in the asteroidal region in the case with large @xmath132 .",
    "as we have shown , the @xmath109 resonance is so strong in the asteroidal region , except the cjs simulations , that the radial compositional structure in the asteroidal region is destroyed even for @xmath221 myr .",
    "the gas dissipation of the order of 0.1 myr or shorter seems to be necessary for the uniform dissipation model ( nagasawa et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "jupiter might have opened a wide gap around its orbit , extending to the entire asteroidal region immediately after its formation ( however , @xmath221 myr or larger may be still possible if @xmath132 is small , when @xmath109 passes the asteroid region , and increases later ) .",
    "in the case of a circularly orbiting jupiter , the initial planetesimals needed to be radially highly concentrated in order to satisfy a large @xmath159 .",
    "in other words , the depletion of mass in the asteroidal region needed to occur before the formation of planetesimals .",
    "such a concentration of planetesimals may be possible if planetesimal formation occurs in radially limited regions after the increase of the surface density due to dust migration ( youdin and shu , 2002 ; youdin and chiang , 2004 ; kretke and lin , 2007 ; brauer et al . ,",
    "morishima et al . (",
    "2008 ) performed @xmath0-body simulations starting from highly concentrated disks in the absence of gas , and found that some of the resulting planetary systems were similar to the current solar system .",
    "the problem of their simulations is that accretion usually completes very quickly ( @xmath222 myr ) , as well as our ejs simulations . nevertheless , one simulation ( run 1 of morishima et al . ,",
    "2008 ) has a very late giant impact .",
    "this system unfortunately has slightly too large an orbital separation between the two largest planets .",
    "hansen ( 2009 ) also made simulations similar to morishima et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and found the mean time of last giant impacts to be 45 myr .",
    "however , the lower limit to the impactor mass ( 0.02 @xmath4 ) used for his definition of giant impacts is probably too small for formation the moon .",
    "further explorations for planetary accretion starting from radially concentrated disks are necessary .",
    "we have performed @xmath0-body simulations which follow the growth and accretion histories of the terrestrial planets , including the effects of the giant planets and the interaction with gas in laminar disks .",
    "we vary initial total mass and spatial distribution of planetesimals , the time scale of dissipation of a gas disk , and the orbits of jupiter and saturn .",
    "it is a remarkable success of numerical simulations , that planetary systems with global properties similar to the terrestrial planets can be obtained starting with a proto - planetary disk .",
    "we are now at the stage where fine details of the models can be compared with solar system constraints . in order to retain a final total mass as massive as the present total mass ( @xmath7 2 earth mass ) in the presence of standard type i migration , the time scale of dissipation of gas needs to be 1 - 2 myr .    using the results from a large number of simulations we compared the evolutionary histories of the resulting planetary systems with the following three properties of the terrestrial planets : ( 1 ) the high radial mass concentration , ( 2 ) the small orbital eccentricities and ( 3 ) the very late moon - forming impact ( @xmath6 myr ) .",
    "the orbital eccentricities of the planets can be as small as their present values if giant impacts finish whilst there is still remnant gas or planetesimals , as expected .",
    "the most serious issue we found was a trade off between the radial mass concentration and the late moon - forming impact .",
    "if the orbital eccentricities of jupiter are as large as the present value , most of bodies in the asteroidal region are swept up to the terrestrial region owing to inward migration of the secular resonance .",
    "although this mechanism helps planetary systems to have high radial concentrations in the end , giant impacts between protoplanets most commonly occur too early ( @xmath710 myr ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the orbital eccentricity of jupiter is close to zero as suggested in the nice model , the effect of the secular resonance is negligible and a large amount of mass stays for a long period of time in the asteroidal region .",
    "although giant impacts usually occur around 100 myr , we inevitably have an earth size planet at around 2 au in this case .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain spatially concentrated terrestrial planets with very late giant impacts , as long as we include all the effects of gas and assume initial disks similar to the minimum mass solar nebular .",
