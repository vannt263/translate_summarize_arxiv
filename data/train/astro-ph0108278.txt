    "multiple galaxies are close to the sight line ( see , e.g. , the top of figure 1 or figure 3 in tripp et al .",

    ", cosmological simulations suggest that the missing baryons are hidden in low - density regions of the igm that have been shock - heated to @xmath3 k. such gas can be revealed using qso absorption lines such as the o  vi or ne  viii doublets ( the o  vi ion fraction peaks at @xmath30 300,000 k ) , and this has been the primary motivation for the observations discussed in this paper .    the first stis observations for this program ( tripp et al . 2000 ; tripp & savage 2000 ) suggested that the number of o  vi systems per unit redshift is indeed interesting .",
    "tripp et al . ( 2000 ) found @xmath31 50 for @xmath32 30 m , albeit with large error bars .",
    "this is more comparable to @xmath23 of low@xmath0 ly@xmath25 absorbers than of other types of metal absorbers , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "we now have more observations , and figure 4 summarizes the @xmath23 of o  vi absorbers from more recent papers , as a function of the limiting equivalent width of the particular sample .",
    "the redshift density of other types of absorbers from the literature are also shown in figure 4 for comparison .",
    "figure 4 shows that @xmath23(o  vi ) appears to increase with decreasing limiting equivalent width,(o  vi ) decreases with increasing limiting @xmath16 at lower redshifts as well . ] as predicted by cosmological simultations ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ; fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "however , more observations are needed to firmly establish this trend .",
    "the high @xmath23 suggests that o  vi systems are an important baryon reservoir .",
    "following analogous calculations ( e.g. , burles & tytler 1996 ; rao & turnshek 2000 ) , the baryonic content of the o  vi absorbers , expressed in the usual fashion ( @xmath33 ) , can be estimated using the following expressions : @xmath34 or , alternatively , @xmath35 assuming @xmath36 = 0 . here",

    "values for ( o / h)@xmath40 and @xmath42(o  vi ) must be assumed , but a conservative result can be obtained by assuming the largest plausible values for these parameters thereby minimizing @xmath24(o  vi ) . in this way , tripp et al .",
    "( 2000 ) derived @xmath43(o  vi ) @xmath44 for a sample with @xmath45 m , assuming a mean metallicity of 1/10 solar and @xmath42(o  vi ) = 0.2 .",
    "similarly , tripp & savage ( 2000 ) obtained @xmath43(o  vi ) @xmath46 for a sample with @xmath47 m .",
    "these lower limits are comparable to the cosmological mass density in the form of stars , cool neutral gas , and x - ray emitting cluster gas at the present epoch ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "however , there are several issues and sources of uncertainty .",
    "first , the results have large error bars due to the small size of the initial samples ; using eqn .",
    "2 , tripp & savage ( 2000 ) obtained @xmath43(o  vi ) @xmath48 at the @xmath49 level",

    "( 2001 ) find @xmath43(o  vi ) @xmath50 with a limiting equivalent width of 50 m , for example .",
    "second , the blocking of some regions of the spectrum by unrelated lines ( e.g. , due to the milky way ism ) reduces the redshift path probed for o  vi lines .",
    "the blocking correction affects @xmath43(o  vi ) because reducing @xmath51 ( and @xmath52 in eqn .",
    "1 ) increases @xmath23 and @xmath43(o  vi ) . in the initial papers",
    ", we used a very simple algorithm to estimate this blocking correction . any strong line that obscured either the o  vi @xmath151032 or @xmath151038 lines reduced the total @xmath51 .",
    "this is conservative and simple , but since we are using a doublet , a more accurate blocking correction can be obtained by checking for the other line of the doublet . if a particular strong line masks @xmath151032 at some redshift , a corresponding @xmath151038 feature should be present at the same @xmath2 ( and vice versa ) . if no corresponding feature is evident , then the strong line does not block an o  vi system .",
    "a more accurate assessment of blocking increases @xmath53 and decreases @xmath43(o  vi ) , but the change is less than a factor of 2 .",
    "third , the mean metallicity of the absorbers may be higher than 0.1@xmath54 .",
    "however , this is countervailed by the fact that @xmath42(o  vi ) is almost certainly less than 0.2 . from their cosmological simulations ,",
    "cen et al . (",
    "2001 ) find @xmath42(o  vi)(z/@xmath55 0.01 for a collisionally ionized o  vi absorber with a 50 m  @xmath151032 line .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath212 lower than the value we have assumed [ reducing @xmath42(o  vi)(z/@xmath56 increases @xmath43(o  vi ) ] .",
    "fourth , there is a concern about double - counting in the baryon census .",
    "the contribution of low@xmath0 ly@xmath25 absorbers to the baryon inventory has been estimated ( penton et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these absorbers are assumed to be photoionized and relatively cool ( @xmath57 k ) .",
    "however , in the hydrodynamic simultions , some ly@xmath25 lines arise in substantially hotter gas ( see figure 4 in dav & tripp 2001 ) . likewise ,",
    "some o  vi systems could be photoionized by the uv background from qsos if the density is low enough .",
    "consequently , some effort is required to disentangle the photoionized and shock - heated absorbers for purposes of the baryon census .",
    "this will likely be challenging , but guidance is already being provided by simulations ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ; fang & bryan 2001 ) .",
    "= 5.0 in    as noted in the previous sections , it is important to understand the physical conditions and metallicities of the o  vi systems in order to assess their baryonic content . what fraction of the o  vi ( and ly@xmath25 ) absorbers are photoionized ?",
    "how can the photoionized and collisionally ionized systems be distinguished ?",
    "answering these questions will greatly alleviate the double - counting problem .",
    "what metallicity should be assumed for calculation of @xmath24(o  vi ) ?",
    "physical conditions and metallicity are interesting properties in their own right , for understanding the nature and evolution of the igm and its influence on and interaction with galaxies and large - scale structures .",
    "our group has scrutinized the ionization mechanism in several o  vi absorbers and derived metallicity constraints ( e.g. , tripp & savage 2000 ; tripp et al .",
    "2001 ; savage et al .",
    "it is often difficult to definitely rule out one source of ionization or another , but in several cases one ionization mechanism is strongly favored . for example , in the intervening o  vi absorber at @xmath6 = 0.06807 in the spectrum of pg0953 + 415 , h  i , c  iii , c  iv , and n  v lines are detected and are well - aligned with the o  vi lines , and all of the column densities are reproduced by a photoionization model with metallicity @xmath58 ( savage et al .",
    "perhaps more importantly , the h  i ly@xmath25 and ly@xmath59 lines associated with the o  vi are narrow and appear to be composed of only one component , and the upper limit on @xmath60 from the width of the h  i lines is @xmath61 k. this precludes collisional ionization , at least in equilibrium , unless the h  i arises in a different phase from the o  vi .",
    "a similar situation is found for the o  vi system studied by tripp & savage ( 2000 ) , although in this case it is possible to hide a broad component in the complicated ly@xmath25 profile , assuming the absorber is a multiphase medium ( see their figure 6 ) .",
    "the o  vi / ly@xmath25 system at @xmath62 in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 is an example of a system which is likely collisionally ionized ( tripp et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this case",
    "a very broad component is evident in the ly@xmath25 profile , which implies that the gas has @xmath63 k. in addition , c  iv is * not * significantly detected , and the o  vi / c  iv column density ratio provides a lower limit on @xmath60 .",

    "derive @xmath64 k and @xmath65 [ o / h ] @xmath66 .",
    "= log ( o / h ) - log ( o / h)@xmath67 . ]",
    "the @xmath1values of the lines provide an important clue regarding the physical conditions of the absorbers .",
    "they provide a straightforward upper limit on the temperature of the gas , @xmath68 ( an upper limit because other factors besides thermal motions , such as turbulence or unresolved blended components , can contribute to the line width ) .",
    "the ly@xmath25 lines provide the most useful constraint along these lines due to the lower mass of hydrogen .",
    "however , fang & bryan ( 2001 ) and cen et al . (",
    "2001 ) have recently noted that in their cosmological simulations , the photoionized and collisionally ionized o  vi systems can be distinguished on the basis of the o  vi @xmath1values : the photoionized absorbers are narrower and have lower equivalent widths than the collisionally ionized systems .",
    "figure 5 shows the doppler parameters and column densities of the o  vi absorbers in table  1 , determined using the profile - fitting software written by fitzpatrick & spitzer ( 1997 ) with the line - spread functions from the stis handbook , along with the formal 1@xmath69 error bars from the profile - fitting code .",
    "the doppler parameter of an o  vi line arising in gas at @xmath70 k , assuming the line width is dominated by thermal broadening , is shown with a dashed line .",
    "the median @xmath1value of the entire sample is 22 km s@xmath19 , and the median o  vi column density is @xmath71 @xmath72 . of course , some of the `` single - component '' systems are so broad that we can be confident that the broadening is not entirely due to thermal motions ( e.g. , the highest column density system in the figure ) , but we do not have sufficient information in the line profiles to decompose these cases into subcomponents .",
    "nevertheless , it is intriguing that the majority of the lines shown in figure  5 have @xmath1values reasonably close to the value expected for gas at @xmath73 k , the temperature at which o  vi peaks in abundance .",
    "there are a few apparently narrow o  vi lines ( but usually these are consistent with @xmath73 k within the 1@xmath69 error bars ) , and these tend to be weaker systems .",
    "this suggests that most of the o  vi absorbers arise in collisionally ionized hot gas .",
    "this contribution has briefly summarized results obtained from high - resolution spectroscopy of low - redshift o  vi absorbers .",
    "initial observations indicate that there is a high number of o  vi systems per unit redshift in the nearby universe , and these systems likely harbor a significant quantity of baryons .",
    "more observations are planned to increase the sample size and total redshift path and thereby place these measurements on firmer statistical grounds .",
    "the systems are correlated with luminous galaxies and are intervening , not ejected / intrinsic absorbers .",
    "however , the nature of the relationship between galaxies and o  vi systems is not yet clear  these lines could arise in unvirialized large - scale filaments ( cen et al .",
    "2001 ) , the intragroup medium in galaxy groups ( mulchaey et al . 1996 ) , escaping winds from individual galaxies ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ) , or the bound ism of individual galaxies ( jenkins 1978 ; savage et al .",
    "the physical conditions and metallicities show a broad range of properties , but in some cases the absorbing media are multiphase . in general , the properties of the o  vi absorbers appear to be broadly consistent with predictions of cosmological simulations of structure growth , but much more observational work and improvements in the simulations are required to flesh out the nature of these absorption line systems and accurately assess their contribution to the baryon budget .",
