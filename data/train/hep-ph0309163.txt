    "recent developments in string theory and its extension m - theory have suggested that the standard model particles are confined on a hypersurface ( called brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional space ( called bulk ) .",
    "only gravity and other exotic matter such as the dilaton can propagate in the bulk  @xcite .",
    "our universe may be such a brane - like object . in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "constraints on the size of extra dimensions become weaker because the standard model particles propagate only in three spatial dimensions .",
    "arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali considered a flat bulk geometry in ( 4+d)-dimensions , in which @xmath0 dimensions are compact with radius @xmath1 ( toroidal topology )  @xcite .",
    "considerable progress was made by randall and sundrum , who considered non - flat , i.e. warped bulk geometries  @xcite . in their first paper , they proposed a mechanism to solve the hierarchy problem by a small extra dimension . in their second paper ,",
    "the braneworld with a positive tension was investigated .",
    "the effective einstein equations and the generalized friedmann equation on the brane were derived  @xcite .",
    "since the energy density of the brane appears quadratically in the new friedmann equation in contrast with the linear behaviour of the usual equation , the scenario has interesting cosmological implications , in particular , the prospects of inflation are enhanced on the brane  @xcite .",
    "modifications to the friedmann constraint equation lead to a faster hubble expansion at high energies and a more strongly damped evolution of the scalar field .",
    "this assists slow rolling inflation , enhances the amount of inflation obtained in any given model , and drives the perturbations towards an exactly scale - invariant harrison - zeldovich spectrum  @xcite .",
    "recently , several authors have investigated the cosmological implications of a tachyon rolling down its potential , which have not been derived from string theory , to its ground state  @xcite .",
    "sufficient inflation driven by the rolling tachyon can be achieved in the context of the braneworld scenario  @xcite .    to date",
    "a question which has not yet been addressed in the literature on inflation in the braneworld scenario is the issue of constraints on the phase space of initial conditions for inflation .",
    "if inflation is to be truly predictive , the evolution when the scalar field is at some given point on the potential has to be independent of the initial conditions .",
    "otherwise , any result , such as the amplitude of density perturbations , would depend on the unknowable initial conditions .",
    "however , the scalar wave equation is a second - order equation , implying that @xmath2 , in principle , can take on any value anywhere on the potential , and so , there certainly is not a unique solution at each point on the potential .",
    "therefore inflation can be predictive only if the solutions exhibit an attractor behavior , where the differences between solutions of different initial conditions rapidly vanish . in the standard cosmology",
    "the inflationary equations do indeed possess this vital property  @xcite . in the braneworld scenario ,",
    "it is interesting and necessary to investigate the initial conditions for inflation . in this paper , using the hamilton - jacobi formalism , we show that inflation driven by a scalar field or a tachyon field on the brane possesses the attractor behavior and obtain a set of exact inflationary solutions . as examples we plot the trajectories in the phase space numerically .",
    "phase portraits indicate that an initial kinetic term decays rapidly and it does not prevent the onset of inflation .",
    "moreover , we find that the trajectories more rapidly reach the slow rolling curve in the braneworld scenario than in the standard cosmology .",
    "in the five - dimensional braneworld scenario  @xcite , the four - dimensional einstein equations induced on the brane can be written as  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter on the brane , @xmath5 is a tensor quadratic in @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a projection of the five - dimensional weyl tensor , describing the effect of bulk graviton degrees of freedom on brane dynamics .",
    "the effective cosmological constant @xmath8 on the brane is determined by the five - dimensional bulk cosmological constant @xmath9 and the brane tension @xmath10 as @xmath11 and the four - dimensional planck scale is given by @xmath12 in a spatially flat friedmann - roberson - walker ( frw ) model the friedmann equation on the brane becomes  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an integration constant arising from @xmath7 , and thus transmitting bulk graviton influence onto the brane .",
    "this term is called the dark radiation term , which can be obtained from a full analysis of the bulk equations . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which indicates that these is a fine - tuning @xmath17 .",
    "if the brane tension @xmath10 is much below the energy scale on the brane , then the new term in @xmath18 is dominant in the modified friedmann equation .",
    "hence , the term in @xmath19 is negligible during inflation in early universe .",
    "we consider a scalar field @xmath20 confined on the brane with self - interaction potential @xmath21 .",
    "the evolution equation of the field is @xmath22 subject to the modified friedmann constraint @xmath23 one can derive a very useful alternative form of these equations by using the scalar field as a time variable  @xcite .",
    "this requires that @xmath20 does not change sign during inflation . without loss of generality",
    ", we can choose @xmath24 throughout .",
    "if this is not satisfied , it can be brought about by redefining @xmath25 .",
    "differentiating eq.([fe ] ) with respect to @xmath26 and using eq.([ee ] ) gives @xmath27 we may divide each side by @xmath2 to eliminate the time dependence in the friedmann equation , obtaining @xmath28 which gives the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to write the friedmann equation in the first - order form @xmath29 ^ 2- \\frac{\\sqrt{6\\sigma}}{\\kappa_4}h(\\phi)=-v(\\phi).\\ ] ] this new set of equations ( [ hj1 ] ) and ( [ hj2 ] ) is the hamilton - jacobi equations , which is normally more convenient than the eqs.([ee ] ) and ( [ fe ] ) .",
    "it allows us to consider @xmath30 , rather than @xmath21 , as the fundamental quantity to be specified .",
    "once @xmath30 has been specified , we immediately can obtain the corresponding potential from eq.([hj2 ] ) . also , eq.([hj1 ] ) gives the relation between @xmath20 and @xmath26 , which enables us to obtain @xmath31 , which , if it is desired , can be integrated to @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , this is the most direct route to obtaining a large set of exact inflationary solutions .    as an example of using ( [ hj1 ] ) and ( [ hj2 ] ) ,",
    "let us consider a universe in the braneworld scenario with @xmath33 .",
    "elementary algebra now gives the potential to be of the form @xmath34 the corresponding evolution of @xmath35 is @xmath36 then we obtain @xmath37   & \\alpha \\ne 2",

    "suppose @xmath38 is any solution to eq.([hj2 ] ) , which can be either inflationary or non - inflationary .",
    "add to this a linear homogeneous perturbation @xmath39 ; the attractor condition will be satisfied if it becomes small as @xmath20 increases . for simplicity , we shall assume , discuss further below , that the perturbations do not reverse the sign of @xmath2 , though the result holds under more general circumstances . substituting @xmath40 into eq.([hj2 ] ) and linearizing it , we find that the perturbation obeys @xmath41 which has the general solution @xmath42,\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the value at some initial point @xmath44 .",

    ", the integrand within the exponential term is negative definite , and hence all linear perturbations do indeed die away . if there is an inflationary solution , all linear perturbations approach it at least exponentially fast as the scalar field rolls .    to study an explicit numerical computation of the phase space trajectories in the braneworld scenario , it is most convenient to rewrite the evolution equations ( [ fe ] ) and ( [ ee ] ) for @xmath48 and @xmath20 as a set of two first - order differential equations with two independent variables @xmath20 and @xmath2 @xmath49\\dot{\\phi}-v'(\\phi).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let us consider two different examples .",
    "in the first example , we consider a new inflation model in the braneworld scenario , with a potential of coleman - weinberg type @xmath50 we choose different initial conditions in the range @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and we follow the evolution until the field begins to oscillate around the true vacuum at @xmath53 .",
    "figure 1 displays the trajectories in the @xmath54 plane for this model in the braneworld scenario , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are dimensionless coordinates @xmath57 we find that an initial kinetic term decays rapidly and it does not prevent the onset of inflation .",
    "there is a curve that attracts most of the trajectories .",
    "this curve corresponds to the slow rolling solution .",
    "moreover , comparing the phase portrait figure 1 to figure 2 reveals that the trajectories more rapidly reach the slow rolling curve in the braneworld scenario than in the standard cosmology .",
    "assuming @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the trajectory with @xmath61 reaches the slow rolling curve at @xmath62 in figure 1 while at @xmath63 in figure 2 .    in the second example",
    ", we investigate the simplest chaotic inflation model on the brane driven by a scalar field with potential @xmath64 all solutions to these two equations can be represented as trajectories in the two - dimensional phase space of @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 displays the trajectories in the @xmath54 plane for this model , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are dimensionless coordinates @xmath65 we see that there is a curve that attracts most of the trajectories .",
    "however , unlike the new inflation case where only a small part of it corresponds to inflation , in the chaotic case the attractor is the inflationary solution . comparing figure 3 to figure 4 , an initial kinetic term decays more rapidly in the braneworld scenario than that in standard cosmology .",

    "we have derived the hamilton - jacobi equations of the inflation driven by a scalar field or a tachyon field , which is confined on a three - dimensional brane in five - dimensional einstein gravity , and have obtained a set of exact inflationary solutions . to demonstrate the attractor behavior",
    ", we use the hamilton - jacobi formalism , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "we restrict ourselves to linear homogeneous perturbations , which is all that is needed because , classically at least , inflation does indeed generate large smooth patches . if the perturbation is nonlinear , then the solution is made more complicated but , because the full equation is only first order , it is easy to see that solutions are compelled to approach one another regardless of whether the perturbation is linear or not . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the perturbations do not reverse the sign of @xmath2 , which can matter only if the perturbation takes the field over the top of a maximum in the potential because otherwise it will simply roll up , reverse its direction , and pass back down through the same point , where it can be regarded as a perturbation on the original solution with the same sign of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , we have investigated two typical models for the scalar field : the new inflation with the coleman - weinberg potential and the chaotic inflation with the simplest potential , and have investigated the tachyon inflation on the brane with the exponential potential .",
    "the phase space trajectories indicate that an initial kinetic term decays rapidly and it does not prevent the onset of inflation , that is , inflation on the brane possesses the attractor behaviour . in phase space",
    "there is a curve that attracts most of the trajectories .",
    "this curve corresponds to the slow rolling solution .",
    "our numerical results show that the initial kinetic terms more rapidly decay and so the trajectories more rapidly reach the inflationary solution in the braneworld scenario than in the standard cosmology . at low energies , @xmath102 , the modified freidmann equation ( [ frw ] )",
    "reduces to the standard form since the term quadratic in the energy density is negligible .",
    "however at high energies , @xmath103 , the term quadratic in the energy density dominates the modified freidmann equation .",
    "the effect of the modified friedmann equations ( [ fe ] ) and ( [ fet ] ) at high energies is to increase the hubble parameter by the new factor @xmath104 .",
    "thus the friction term @xmath105 in the evolution equation of the field ( [ ee ] ) or ( [ eet ] ) becomes larger , which leads to more rapid decay of the initial kinetic term .",
