    "in systematic investigations of the e1 transitions @xcite the low  lying 1@xmath3 have been observed in spherical nuclei states , which are characterized by strong b(e1;@xmath4 ) , of the order of several units@xmath5 .",
    "it was demonstrated that these low  lying 1@xmath3 states arise as @xmath6 due to coupling of the collective quadrupole 2@xmath7 and the collective octupole 3@xmath8 states .",
    "similar 1@xmath8 states have been observed in the cd , sn , ba , ce , nd , and sm isotopes .",
    "their two  phonon character has been proved by the observed strong e2 and e3 transitions to the corresponding one  phonon states @xcite and by the fact that the energies of these 1@xmath8 states are very close to the summed energies @xmath9 .",
    "strong correlations between the values of b(e1;@xmath10 ) and the product of average squares of the quadrupole @xmath11 and octupole @xmath12 deformation parameters in nonmagic nuclei @xcite clearly show that away from the closed shells the large b(e1 ) values have a collective nature connected with the motion of the nuclear shape .",
    "the ratio @xmath13/@xmath14 is amazingly constant , although the b(e1 ) strength varies by an order of magnitude in the considered nuclei .    accepting a two  phonon picture of the 1@xmath8 states",
    "let us consider the other important experimental facts characterizing strong e1 transitions between low  lying states .",
    "+  analyzing the experimental data on the ratio b(e1;@xmath15/b(e1;@xmath16 it was shown in @xcite that this ratio is a constant equal to 1 within a factor of 2 although these e1 transition strengths can differ by about two orders of magnitude for different nuclei .",
    "semimagic even@xmath17 nuclei and even  even nuclei with two or four nucleons outside a closed shell were considered in this analysis .",
    "these nuclei are rather vibrational and can be understood , at least qualitatively , in a harmonic phonon picture . in the last model b(e1;@xmath15/b(e1;@xmath18 .",
    "this correlation of the e1 strengths can be considered as an additional support for the quadrupole  octupole coupled character of the 1@xmath8 states . + ",
    "the b(e1;@xmath19 is small in sn isotopes ; however , it increase in cd , te isotopes and approach the alaga value for the ratio b(e1;@xmath19/b(e1;@xmath15 in deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "+  a minimum has been found in the @xmath17dependence of b(e1;@xmath15 in the nd , sm and ba isotopes when the number of neutrons @xmath20 is equal to 78 or 86 @xcite .",
    "this characteristic feature of the behavior of b(e1;@xmath15 as a function of @xmath20 has been discovered earlier in the rpa  based calculations in @xcite .",
    "+  strong e1 transitions between the @xmath21 octupole  phonon states and the 2@xmath22 mixed  symmetry quadrupole one  phonon states in the spherical nuclei @xmath23zr@xmath24 , @xmath25mo@xmath24 , @xmath26ru@xmath24 and @xmath27ce@xmath28 are observed @xcite . in these four nuclei",
    "the e1 transitions to the 2@xmath22 state are stronger than to the 2@xmath29 state .",
    "probably , this is a consequence of the isovector nature of the e1 transition operator , which enhances e1 transitions between the mixed symmetry states and the isoscalar ones . in the last case",
    ", this is the isoscalar octupole vibrational state .",
    "+ since b(e1;@xmath30 are strong the question arises if there should appear strong e1 transitions from the ground state to the @xmath31 state , which is expected at the excitation energy 4187 kev in @xmath32zr , 4601 kev in @xmath33mo , 4934 kev in @xmath34ru and 3658 kev in @xmath35ce .",
    "however , anharmonic effects , which can shift the energies of these two  phonon states , should not be excluded .    summarizing the short review of the data we can see that the microscopical model describing strong e1 transitions at low energies basing on the two  phonon quadrupole ",
    "octupole model of the low lying 1@xmath8 states should explain : +  the fact that b(e1;@xmath15/b(e1;@xmath36 at least in near magic nuclei ; + an increase of b(e1;@xmath19 when going away from the closed shell ; +  the existence of the minimum in the @xmath17  dependence of b(e1;@xmath37 when moving off the semimagic nuclei ; +  the fact that b(e1;@xmath38 b(e1;@xmath16 .",
    "+  proportionality of b(e1;@xmath37 to @xmath39 in collective nuclei ; +",
    "in @xcite the @xmath1  phonon approach to the description of the positive parity collective states was developed within the interacting boson model .",
    "it was shown that the wave vectors of the yrast , the second @xmath40 and the second @xmath41 states could be described to a high accuracy over the whole parameter space of the consistent @xmath1 hamiltonian , i.e. , far outside of the region where a picture of harmonic vibrations was correct , by simple universal expressions contaning only one or two multiple @xmath1phonon configurations .",
    "a simple structure of the wave vectors helps derive different relations between transition matrix elements .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , where the @xmath1phonon approach was formulated for the bosonic configurational space of the interacting boson model , in the present paper this approach is formulated for the fermionic configurational space .",
    "in addition , we consider both positive and negative parity states .    in the @xmath1phonon approach the @xmath42 state is presented by the following expression @xmath43 is the ground state vector ,",
    "@xmath44 + = @xmath45/ @xmath46 and @xmath47 is in our case the standard shell model quadrupole moment operator @xmath48 expressed in terms of the nucleon creation @xmath49 and annihilation @xmath50 operators .",
    "let us include into consideration the octupole mode @xmath51 = @xmath52/ @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the fermionic octupole moment operator @xmath55 as we know from the rpa type calculations @xcite both expressions ( [ 1-eq ] ) and ( [ 3-eq ] ) are very good approximations for the lowest collective @xmath40 and @xmath56 states .",
    "in fact , this is a consequence of the well  known from the experiment result that e2 and e3 transitions from the ground state to the @xmath42 and @xmath21 states , correspondingly , are much stronger than transitions to higher lying @xmath40 and @xmath56 states .    continuing along this line and remembering that the 1@xmath8 state is mainly a quadrupole  octupole two  phonon state we suggest for the 1@xmath8 state vector that @xmath57 we obtain the following relation : @xmath58 the last three terms in the right  hand side of ( [ 6-eq ] ) can give a noticeable contribution only in the case of strong mixing of the two  phonon quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole and two  phonon octupole ",
    "octupole states .",
    "however , as it is known from the rpa type calculations @xcite , this mixing is insignificant : less than 1@xmath59 . neglecting these terms we obtain an approximate relation @xmath60    the wave vector ( [ 5-eq ] ) can be written in terms of the rpa collective phonons and the two ",
    "quasiparticle components which correspond to the noncollective rpa solutions . written in this way",
    "the wave vector ( [ 5-eq ] ) has the two  phonon component with one quadrupole and one octupole collective rpa phonons as the main component , the three ",
    "phonon component with two collective quadrupole and one collective octupole rpa phonons , and the two ",
    "quasiparticle @xmath61 components .",
    "it means that the results of our @xmath1  phonon approach should be compaired not with the pure rpa calculations but with the rpa based calculations which include also anharmonic effects .",
    "a contribution of the last two components to the norm of the wave vector ( [ 5-eq ] ) is very small for nuclei considered in the present paper .",
    "of course , when we approach a deformed region the following @xmath1  phonon component @xmath62 becomes more and more important since in this region there are not one but two @xmath61 states with @xmath63=0 and @xmath63=1 . to construct the @xmath61 state with @xmath63 as a good quantum number ,",
    "it is necessary to take a mixture of the states ( [ 5-eq ] ) and ( [ 8-eq ] ) .",
    "this mixing , which can be estimated as 70@xmath59 of one component plus 30@xmath59 of the other one can be considered as an upper limit for the error connected with the approximation ( [ 5-eq ] ) .",
    "of course , near spherical nuclei this mixing is much smaller . in transitional nuclei with soft @xmath64  mode the @xmath1  phonon state @xmath65 can also become important .",
    "the strength of the @xmath1  phonon scheme lies in a possibility to derive relations between electromagnetic transition matrix elements also outside the analytically solvable harmonic vibrator and rotor limits .",
    "this is possible because of the simple form of the wave vectors in this approach .",
    "this possibility is realized in this section below and in sections iii and iv .",
    "however , the wave vectors ( [ 1-eq ] ) , ( [ 3-eq ] ) and ( [ 5-eq ] ) only look simple .",
    "the multipole moment operators in these expressions act on the exact ground state .",
    "thus , for calculations we needed an expression for the ground state vector . in section",
    "v we take as an approximation to the ground state vector the vacuum state of the rpa phonons .",
    "let us apply the model formulated above to calculations of the matrix element of the e1 @xmath2 transition .",
    "we obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the operator of the electric dipole transition .",
    "since multipole operators @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 commute with each other we can rewrite the last expression as @xmath71 using expressions ( [ 1-eq ] ) , ( [ 3-eq ] ) and relation ( [ 7-eq ] ) we can rewrite ( [ 11-eq ] ) in the following way : @xmath72 > from the last expression using the wigner  eckart theorem we obtain @xmath73 and from ( [ 13-eq ] ) we get @xmath74 the last value coincides with that of the harmonic phonon picture",
    ". however , we did not use the assumption of harmonicity of quadrupole and octupole vibrations .",
    "thus , the @xmath1phonon model explains qualitatively one of the experimental results mentioned in introduction .",
    "however , the value of the ratio 7/3 deviates from the experimental observation 1@xmath752 . a possible reason for this deviation can be the presence of some admixtures in the @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 states which are not taken into account by the @xmath1phonon approach .",
    "the corrections to relation ( [ 7-eq ] ) discussed above will also influence the number in the right  hand side of ( [ 14-eq ] ) .",
    "mention , however , a very small value of @xmath79 obtain in @xcite . taken together with the known value of @xmath80 it produces the value of the ratio ( [ 14-eq ] ) which is much larger than 7/3 .",
    "let us consider the matrix element @xmath82 .",
    "this matrix element can be written in the following way : @xmath83 having in mind that the @xmath2 transition is the strongest one among the low  lying states we can rewrite approximately ( [ 15-eq ] ) as @xmath84 and as a consequence of ( [ 16-eq ] ) we obtain @xmath85 the quadrupole moment of the @xmath0 state can be expressed approximately in terms of the quadrupole moments of the @xmath42 and @xmath21 states .",
    "finally , we have @xmath86 > from ( [ 18-eq ] ) we can see that going from the magic or semimagic nuclei to nuclei with open shell the ratio b(e1;@xmath81)/b(e1;@xmath87 ) increases with the quadrupole moments of the first @xmath40 and @xmath56 states . in order to obtain the alaga rule for the ratio of the matrix elements @xmath88/@xmath89 , we must take into account an admixture of @xmath90 to the @xmath76 state .",
    "for completeness of the consideration the results of the very schematic ibm  based analysis of the e1 transitions between the low  lying collective states are given in this section below .",
    "a detailed analysis is presented in @xcite .",
    "let us analyse qualitatively the quantity b(e1;@xmath2 ) in order to understand a possible reason for the appearance of the minimum in the neutron number dependence of this quantity when going away from the closed neutron shell @xmath20=82 . as it follows from relation ( [ 13-eq ] ) , instead of @xmath91 we can consider the matrix element @xmath92 . in the ibm @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the states with the maximum value of the @xmath93spin : @xmath94 .",
    "the dipole transition operator @xmath70 is mainly the @xmath93spin vector . to simplify the discussion",
    ", we assume below that the e1 transition operator is exactly the @xmath93spin vector .",
    "then @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the numbers of the valence protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "if we consider a nucleus with the closed neutron , shell , then as it is seen from ( [ 19-eq ] ) , only protons will contribute to the matrix element @xmath92 .",
    "if we start to increase the number of valence neutrons , then a neutron contribution to @xmath92 will increase compensating , partly , a proton contribution .",
    "this matrix element takes the minimum value when @xmath98 .",
    "of course , this phenomenological analysis can not give us the value of @xmath99 at which @xmath92 has a minimum because the physical e1 transition operator does not reduce to the @xmath93  spin vector .",
    "in the ibm  based consideration it is assumed , in fact , that a microscopic structure of the proton and the neutron bosons does not change from nucleus to nucleus .",
    "however , it is not evident that this assumption will be supported by the microscopic calculations .",
    "the results of the rpa based microscopic analysis are presented below .    in a similar way , transitions between the @xmath21 and @xmath100 states @xcite can be considered .",
    "in contrast to the preceding case the @xmath101 state is a state with @xmath102 . therefore , @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 . therefore , @xmath106 it is seen from ( [ 20-eq ] ) and ( [ 21-eq ] ) that in contrast to ( [ 19-eq ] ) there is no cancellation of the proton and neutron contributions to the matrix element .",
    "thus , this analysis indicates a possible reason for a large value of the @xmath107 matrix element @xcite .",
    "let us assume , by analogy with section ii , that the @xmath108 state is created by an action of the operator @xmath109 on the ground state . here",
    "@xmath110 is the neutron ( proton ) quadrupole operator .",
    "this state is constructed so as to be orthogonal to the @xmath42 state . then using as above a commutativity of the operators ( [ mixed - eq ] ) and @xmath70 we obtain from the inequality + @xmath111 that @xmath112 .",
    "the last statement seems to be in disagreement with the analytical result presented in @xcite ( table 3 ) . a possible reason is connected with a different proton  neutron structure of the shell model e1 transition operator and the two  body term in the @xmath113 ibm2 e1 transition operator .",
    "roughly speaking , the proton and neutron parts of the shell model e1 transition operator has opposite signs . only a small part of this operator proportinal to @xmath114 , which appears because of substraction of the center of mass motion , contains proton and neutron contributions with the same signs .",
    "however , the two  body term in the @xmath113 ibm2 e1 transition operator used in @xcite contains the proton and neutron parts with the same sign . as a consequence , the value of b(e1;@xmath115 ) , to which only a two  body term contributes , becomes small and if @xmath116=1 , i.e. , a two  body term becomes the @xmath93spin vector , b(e1;@xmath115)=0 .    in this paper",
    ", we did not calculate the matrix element @xmath117 .",
    "however , if we take expression ( [ mixed - eq ] ) as an approximation for the operator , which produces the @xmath100 state acting on the ground state , then the proton and the neutron contributions to this matrix element will have the same sign and for this reason @xmath118 will be larger than @xmath119 .",
    "the aim of this section is to calculate the dipole transitional matrix element @xmath120 , basing on expressions ( [ 1-eq ] ) , ( [ 3-eq ] ) and ( [ 5-eq ] ) for the state vectors @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath76 and on the rpa approximation for the ground state .",
    "thus , in the calculations below it is assumed that the wave vectors of the @xmath42 , @xmath21 and @xmath0 states are @xmath121 ) and ( [ 18-eq ] ) is independent of a concrete structure of the @xmath122 state and is based only on the @xmath1phonon form of the wave vectors , the results obtained below are consistent with relations ( [ 14-eq ] ) and ( [ 18-eq ] ) .",
    "we assume below that the ground state contains only those correlations which are produced by the quadrupole ",
    "quadrupole and the octupole  octupole interactions .",
    "the quadrupole and octupole interaction constants are fixed so as to reproduce the experimental values of the b(e2;@xmath123 and the b(e3;@xmath124 , respectively .",
    "the ground state correlations related to the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction are not included .",
    "therefore , calculating the strength of the e1 transitions we must introduce the core polarization factor @xmath125 which takes into account a shift of a part of the e1 strength to the giant dipole resonance @xcite .",
    "mention that the rpa  type calculations of the e1 transitions were performed in @xcite .    in our approach based on the @xmath1phonon description",
    "the following expressions describe a microscopic structure of the @xmath77 and @xmath78 state vectors @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 in the above expressions summation is performed over both proton and neutron single particle states . in ( [ 25-eq ] ) and ( [ 26-eq ] )",
    "@xmath129 and @xmath130 are the creation operators of the most collective quadrupole and octupole rpa phonons corresponding to the first roots of the rpa secular equation ; @xmath131 is the quasiparticle creation operator ; @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the rpa amplitudes describing a microscopic structure of the most collective phonons @xmath129 and @xmath129 ; @xmath134 are the coefficients of the bogoliubov transformation ; @xmath135 is the normalization factor . in ( [ 25-eq ] ) and ( [ 26-eq ] ) dipole excitations are presented by the two  quasiparticle and not by the phonon operators because dipole ",
    "dipole correlations in the ground state are not taken into account .",
    "of course , summation is performed over all @xmath136 two  quasiparticle states .",
    "contributions of the second terms in ( [ 25-eq ] ) and ( [ 26-eq ] ) to the total norm are of the order of 1@xmath59 or less .",
    "the wave vector of the @xmath0 state contains the following components : @xmath137,@xmath138 @xmath139 and @xmath140 . among them",
    "the first one gives the main contribution to the norm , which is close to 100@xmath59 .",
    "there are also other components in the wave vectors of the @xmath42 , @xmath21 and @xmath0 states .",
    "however , they are small and unimportant for calculations of the e1 transitions . a similar conclusion about a microscopic structure of the @xmath0 state was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the components of the wave vectors of the @xmath42 , @xmath21 and @xmath0 states , containing operators creating two ",
    "quasiparticle @xmath61 states , appear because the quadrupole and the octupole multipole operators representing the corresponding state vectors according to ( [ 1-eq ] ) , ( [ 3-eq ] ) and ( [ 5-eq ] ) , are not exhausted by the one  boson term expressed in collective bosons only . in the calculations based on the quasiparticle ",
    "phonon model @xcite this admixture is generated by the quasiparticle ",
    "phonon coupling term which is produced by the terms in @xmath68 and @xmath69 additional to the one  boson term . however , the weight of this contribution in the norm of the eigenstate is similar in both the approaches . for the reduced matrix element @xmath89 we obtain the following expression : @xmath141 where @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 in ( [ 33-eq ] ) , ( [ 34-eq ] ) and ( [ 35-eq ] ) @xmath147 or @xmath148 .",
    "the quantities @xmath149 and the matrices @xmath150 are determined by the expressions analogous to ( [ 29-eq ] ) and ( [ 27-eq ]  [ 28-eq ] ) , respectively , though with summation over proton or neutron single particle states only .",
    "the results of the calculations of the electric dipole transitional matrix element are presented in figures 1 and 2 and in tables 19 . here besides the total calculated dipole transitional matrix element @xmath151 including all contributions the results obtained without inclusion of the contribution coming from the @xmath136 two  quasiparticle admixture denoted by @xmath152 are also shown .",
    "the results presented in tables 1 and 2 and in figs . 1 and 2 show that in cd , sn , ba , ce and partly in nd and sm isotopes the experimental data are between the results of calculations obtained with and without a contribution of an admixture of a dipole two  quasiparticle component to the @xmath0 state .",
    "however , in many cases the matrix element @xmath153 , which includes only a collective contribution , is closer to the experimental data than the total matrix element , which includes both collective and two  quasiparticle contributions .",
    "nevertheless , we can see that the two  quasiparticle admixture to the collective quadrupole  octupole two  phonon component of the @xmath0 state should be taken into account to improve agreement with the experimental data . in the present calculations ,",
    "this contribution of the two  quasiparticle component is overestimated . however , since the weight of this component is smaller than 1@xmath59 it is difficult to expect such an accuracy from the microscopic calculations .",
    "we can conclude that the two  phonon component @xmath154 , which gives the main contribution to the norm of the @xmath76 state , determines an excitation energy and the e2 and e3 decay properties of the @xmath76 state .",
    "however , for description of the electric dipole transitions @xmath2 it is necessary to take into account also an admixture of the dipole two  quasiparticle component .    as it is seen from expressions ( [ 25-eq ] ) and ( [ 26-eq ] ) , the components containing two  quasiparticles coupled to angular momentum @xmath155=1 contribute also to the structure of the @xmath42 and @xmath21 states .",
    "since the microscopic e1 transitional operator contains in addition to the quadrupole ",
    "octupole phonon term a term changing the number of quasiparticles by two units , these components contribute to the @xmath156 transition matrix element .",
    "both sets of the results obtained with and without inclusion of the contribution of the two  quasiparticle component of the @xmath0 state reproduce also an experimental @xmath17dependence of the reduced matrix element . only in @xmath157nd and @xmath158sm a depth of the minimum in the @xmath17dependence of @xmath159 is significantly larger than in the calculated results . as it was noted in introduction this matrix element has a minimum when the number of neutrons is equal to the magic number plus(minus ) four neutrons . in tables",
    "38 the calculated ratios of the matrix elements @xmath160/@xmath161 are compared with the experimental ones .",
    "it is seen that in the case of cd , sn , ba and ce isotopes our calculations reproduce an @xmath17dependence of the reduced dipole matrix element .",
    "however , in nd and sm isotopes experimental data have a deeper minimum than the calculated values .",
    "calculations rather show a delay in an increase of the absolute value of the matrix element with increasing a number of the valence particles or holes",
    ".    in the case of the nd and sm isotopes the results of the microscopic calculations deviate from the picture which follows from the analysis of an @xmath17dependence of @xmath162 in the interacting boson model , where it is clearly seen that the reduced matrix element @xmath162 decreases if the number of valence protons is fixed , but the number of valence neutrons increases from zero . in the microscopic calculations , a proton contribution to the e1 transition matrix element changes when the number of valence neutrons varies",
    "although the number of valence protons continue to be fixed .",
    "this fact is illustrated by the results presented in table 9 where the quantities @xmath163 and @xmath164 determined by eqs .",
    "( [ 31-eq][32-eq ] ) are shown for the nd isotopes .",
    "the nature of the electric dipole two  quasiparticle component admixed to the wave function of the @xmath0 state is an interesting question .",
    "since this component is a mixture of many spherical two  quasiparticle states , we can consider it formally as the @xmath165boson introduced in @xcite .",
    "if we separate this component from the wave function of the @xmath0 state , change its normalization coefficient so as to obtain a wave function with the norm equal to one and calculate the e1 reduced matrix element between this artificially constructed state and the ground state , we obtain the value of the order of 0.60.7 @xmath166fm . for comparison , for a pure alpha  cluster state we obtain approximately 6 @xmath166fm . for the 1p1h ( 1h@xmath167 1g@xmath168)@xmath169 proton state this matrix element is equal to 1.7 @xmath166fm .",
    "so , it is difficult to do a definite conclusion about the nature of this two  quasiparticle admixture .    concluding this section we should like to stress that any microscopic consideration of the enhanced e1 transitions can not be performed in a harmonic approximation , i.e. ,",
    "can not be carried out in the framework of the pure rpa and requires from the beginning an inclusion of the anharmonic effects .",
    "indeed , in the pure rpa calculations only those parts of the one  body fermion operators are taken into account which change the number of quasiparticles by two units .",
    "the terms of the form @xmath170 are neglected .",
    "the only exception is the part of the nuclear hamiltonian which describes noninteracting quasiparticles because of its leading role .",
    "however , just the term of the form @xmath170 describes @xmath171 e1 transition .",
    "therefore , the terms of this kind in the @xmath68 and the @xmath69 operators should be included into consideration .",
    "however , this inclusion leads to appearance of the anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian since the latter contains quadrupole  quadrupole and octupole  octupole interactions .",
    "an inclusion into the operators @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the terms proportional to @xmath172 is necessary to conserve commutativity of these operators .",
    "this conclusive remark shows that a comparison of the present microscopic consideration , which from the beginning contains anharmonic effects , with the u(5 ) limit of ibm is difficult .",
    "in conclusion , based on the @xmath1phonon representation of the wave vectors of the low  lying collective states we have derived the relations between different reduced matrix elements of the e1 transition operator .",
    "these relations explain qualitatively the experimentally observed correlations among data on e1 transitions .    using the rpa approximation for the ground state vector and the @xmath1  phonon form of the @xmath0 state we performed microscopic calculations of the reduced matrix element of the e1 transition operator between @xmath173 and @xmath76 states .",
    "it is shown that the two  quasiparticle component of the wave vector of the @xmath76 state should be taken into account to achieve an agreement with the experimental data in spite of a small contribution of this component to the norm of the @xmath76 state .",
