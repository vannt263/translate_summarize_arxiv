    "the high @xmath0 oxides fall in the category of highly correlated systems .",
    "a manifestation of this fact is that in the underdoped regime there exists a pseudogap.@xcite precisely how it is to be described remains controversial.@xcite in certain theories it is closely related to superconducting correlations,@xcite and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 is the temperature at which phase coherence is lost . in other theories",
    "the pseudogap has its origin in completely different correlations and is a manifestation of a competing order such as a @xmath3-density wave ( ddw ) . in any case interactions among charge carriers",
    "play an important role in such systems and can not be ignored in any realistic approach to their properties even around optimum doping which is the case of interest here .",
    "while many aspects of the superconducting state can be understood qualitatively on the basis of extensions of bcs theory , particularly around optimum doping , the search for essential differences@xcite has remained an important avenue of investigation .",
    "in particular the idea of kinetic energy as opposed to potential energy driven superconductivity ( i.e. : the kinetic energy is reduced at the transition temperature ) and its relation to the os has recently been given serious consideration in theory@xcite and experimentally.@xcite an issue of importance is the relation of the kinetic energy ( ke ) to the optical sum ( os ) .",
    "a recent paper@xcite has provided some insight into this relationship and has given a comparison with experiment for the temperature variation of the os in the normal state , its change at @xmath0 , and its further evolution in the superconducting state .",
    "correlations beyond bcs pairing were not considered , however .",
    "there have also been several recent studies of the temperature dependence of the os , experimentally for the system la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , ref .  , and , theoretically , using other models.@xcite    within a bcs model , the condensation is potential energy driven and , in fact , the ke increases because the probability of occupation of the state * k * @xmath7 becomes smeared at the fermi energy by the opening of the gap .",
    "this translates into a decrease in the os as compared with its normal state value .",
    "but this is opposite to the behavior obtained experimentally in ref .  .",
    "however , as mentioned , the theoretical discussion of ref .   is based on a non interacting model in the normal state and includes pairing correlations in the superconducting state only at the level of bcs .",
    "more sophisticated formulations of the theory of superconductivity could give different results .",
    "also , interactions can significantly modify the results even in the normal state , as has been demonstrated recently by knigavko _",
    "et al._@xcite in a simplified model in which the charge carriers are coupled to a single einstein mode .",
    "while only the normal state was considered , it was found that boson hardening ( softening ) results in an increase ( decrease ) in the os and that interactions play an important role in determining temperature dependences .    in this paper",
    "we study a tight binding model with an emphasis on the effect interactions can have on the os , particularly on its temperature dependence and its relationship to the ke . here , the interactions among the charge carriers are treated in the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( naffl ) model.@xcite a review of its main properties and successes is given in ref .  .",
    "the model is phenomenological and falls into the general class of boson exchange models where the interaction between electrons proceeds through the exchange of spin fluctuations.@xcite the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility replaces the phonon propagator of the classic electron - phonon eliashberg theory . the spin susceptibility could be calculated from microscopic theory .",
    "more usually , however , it is fit to experimental data , specifically to nmr in ref .  .",
    "the basic idea is that the doped metallic cuprates are near an antiferromagnetic phase boundary and that coupling to spin fluctuations is therefore strong .",
    "while there is no consensus as to the validity of such a model when applied to the oxides the naffl model has been widely discussed and has had considerable successes particularly in correlating superconducting properties,@xcite and has been used to give a detailed description of the optical properties in the high @xmath0 oxides at optimum doping . in any case , the naffl model@xcite provides a convenient and specific framework within which we can study the effect of correlations on the os and on related properties .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we summarize the basic equations that are needed to compute the optical sum integral as well as the ke .",
    "they are a set of three coupled generalized eliashberg equations written for any momentum * k * in the two dimensional cuo@xmath8 brillouin zone .",
    "they involve renormalized matsubara frequencies , the renormalized quasiparticle energies as well as the superconducting energy gap . the interaction between the charge carriers",
    "is mediated by the exchange of spin fluctuations and involve the spin susceptibility .",
    "fast fourier transforms ( fft ) provide solutions which give a @xmath3-wave gap as observed in experiments . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we apply our solutions to evaluate the probability of occupation of the state of momentum * k * and spin @xmath2 @xmath1 from which the os and the ke follow .",
    "their temperature dependence is studied .",
    "comparison with the non interacting case is made and it is concluded that interactions can profoundly modify results .",
    "different behaviors can result depending on the choice of microscopic parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we consider explicitly the superconducting state . here , again , generalized eliashberg equations give variations with @xmath9 which are considerably different from earlier bcs results .",
    "when the electron - exchange boson interaction is taken as temperature independent and independent of state , the os is lower in the superconducting than in the normal state .",
    "nevertheless , it can keep increasing with decreasing temperature in contrast to bcs where it was found to decrease .",
    "this increase can be traced to the underlying temperature dependence of the os which depends on details of the band structure and interactions involved , for example on the model spin susceptibility .",
    "further , if we take account of the low energy gaping of the spin susceptibility which is brought about by the superconducting transition ( a process which is not operative in the normal state ) the ke can be further decreased and there is an additional increase in the os which can effectively increase faster than it does in the normal state . in this case",
    "the ke in the superconducting state with low energy gaping of the spin susceptibility can be less than in the normal state without low energy gaping .",
    "an important conclusion of our work is that the observation of a faster increase in the os with decreasing temperature in the superconducting state than in the normal state can not unambiguously be taken to be an indication of kinetic energy driven superconductivity in contrast to a recent claim by van der marel _ et al._@xcite in sec .",

    "we note , however , that in our formulation the os , at any given temperature , is always below ( although not very much ) its normal state value at this same temperature calculated with the spectrum with a low frequency cutoff ( open triangles ) .",
    "but this cutoff is only operative in the superconducting state and is responsible for making the open triangles fall above the solid squares .",
    "the kinetic energy in the superconducting state with low frequency cutoff is now less than the normal state kinetic energy without cutoff . including the feedback mechanism of the formation of the superconducting state on the spin susceptibility itself has the net effect , at zero temperature ( where it is largest ) , of changing the sign of the ke contribution to the condensation energy from that in bcs .",
    "we have used the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid model to study the effect of interactions on the optical sum and on the kinetic energy in tight binding bands .",
    "comparison of normal state results with equivalent results when interactions are neglected showed that temperature variations can be strongly affected by details of the microscopic parameters involved in the spin fluctuation exchange mechanism .",
    "behaviors are possible which can be quite different from the non interacting independent particle model .",
    "comparison with normal state experimental data proves that the tight binding model of non interacting particles is certainly not adequate to describe properly the temperature dependence of the optical sum .",
    "( this has also been observed by benfatto _",
    "et al._@xcite ) taking into account interactions between the charge carriers makes the tight binding model a viable model for the analysis of the temperature dependence of the normal state optical sum .",
    "this was demonstrated for the particular case of bscco and a particle interaction modeled on the naffl .",
    "other models , like the one presented by toschi _",
    "et al._@xcite are also capable to reproduce the temperature dependence @xmath97 but they lack agreement with the value of the optical sum at zero temperature .    when superconductivity is considered within an eliashberg formalism , the superconducting gap has @xmath3-wave symmetry as a function of momentum in the two dimensional brillouin zone .",
    "the optical sum is found to decrease with decreasing temperature for some range of parameters characterizing the spin susceptibility but can also increase .",
    "this increase can not necessarily be interpreted as kinetic energy driven superconductivity .",
    "in fact , in all cases considered , the optical sum is always lower , at a given temperature in the superconducting state , than it is in the corresponding normal state but , in some cases not by much .",
    "correspondingly , the kinetic energy is increased in the superconducting state .",
    "what makes the optical sum and ke integral continue to go up ( in some cases ) with decreasing temperature is the fact that the interactions themselves introduce a temperature dependence in the underlying normal state .",
    "the results just described were obtained for a fixed ( i.e. : temperature independent ) value of the spin susceptibility . if we consider the possibility that the spin fluctuation spectrum may itself be modified@xcite by the onset of superconductivity and by temperature , even larger increases in the optical sum with decreasing temperature can be obtained .",
    "it is widely recognized that a generic feature of an electronic mechanism of superconductivity is the possible gaping of the excitation spectrum itself at small energies due to the opening of the superconducting gap .",
    "this leads to a weakening of interactions at small @xmath103 and to the so called collapse of the inelastic scattering rate@xcite which manifests itself as a large peak in the temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity .",
    "the weakening of the interaction in the superconducting state through the opening of a low energy gap in the spin susceptibility corresponds to a decrease in ke in the superconducting state which can , in the case considered , more than compensate for the intrinsic increase that accompanies the formation of cooper pairs and , consequently , the os rises with a larger slope in the superconducting state than in the normal state just above @xmath0 . at @xmath0",
    "there is no low energy gaping of the spin susceptibility and , therefore , the mechanism for ke reduction just described is not operative . in this sense our model",
    "does not describe ke driven superconductivity .",
