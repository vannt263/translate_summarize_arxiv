    "the origin of dust grains in the universe is one of the fundamental problems in astrophysics .",
    "it is widely believed that the evolution of dust content in galaxies is influenced by dust formation in stellar ejecta , dust destruction in supernova ( sn ) remnants , and grain growth by the accretion of metals onto the preexisting dust grains in molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "various authors have shown that grain growth in molecular clouds dominates the increase of dust mass in nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite also mention that grain growth depends on the mean surface - to - volume ratio of the dust grains . in our previous work (",
    "* hereafter hk11 ) , we have investigated the effects of dust grain size distribution on grain growth , and found that the grain size distribution has a large influence on the efficiency of grain growth because the surface - to - volume ratio is governed by the grain size distribution .",
    "the extinction curves in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds can be explained with dust grain size distributions @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the grain radius and @xmath5 is the number density of grains whose radius is between @xmath4 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "however , high - redshift quasars exhibit different extinction curves from the ones in local galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may indicate different grain size distributions .",
    "different dust sources and/or different grain processing in the early universe may be the reason for the different extinction curves in high-@xmath2 quasars . in the early universe ,",
    "type ii supernovae ( simply denoted as sne in this paper ) should be the foremost source of dust formation because of the short lifetimes of the progenitors @xcite , albeit asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars may have contribution even at @xmath0 for some stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "star - forming regions may also host significant grain processing such as shattering @xcite .",
    "grain growth in molecular clouds may dominate the grain mass increase not only in the local universe but also at high @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the potential importance of dust grain size distributions in grain growth has not been focused on . as emphasized above",
    ", the grain size distributions in high-@xmath2 quasars should be different from those in local galaxies .",
    "therefore , we should reconsider grain growth by using grain size distributions applicable to high-@xmath2 systems .",
    "size distributions of grains produced and ejected from sne ( called sn - dust ) are calculated by @xcite , who take dust condensation and destruction in sne into account .",
    "they show that the average grain size of sn - dust is biased to large sizes because small grains are efficiently trapped in the shocked region and considerably destroyed by thermal sputtering .",
    "this means that the grain size distribution is completely different from the local @xmath7-law and that the surface - to - volume ratio is smaller than the local one . as a result",
    ", we have to reexamine whether grain growth is efficient enough to explain the large dust abundance in high-@xmath2 quasars .",
    "after sn - dust is injected into the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the grain size distribution can be modified .",
    "dust grains acquire large velocity dispersions in a warm ionized medium through dynamical coupling with turbulent motion @xcite .",
    "grain collisions at velocities driven by turbulence lead to efficient shattering , which produces a large number of small grains @xcite",
    ". the extinction curve observed in a high-@xmath2 quasar by @xcite is also reproduced by a grain size distribution after shattering @xcite .",
    "shattering raises the surface - to - volume ratio , leading to a higher grain growth rate .    in this letter , we examine the significance of grain size distribution on grain growth in high-@xmath2 quasars by focusing on two different grain size distributions as representative ones expected theoretically in high-@xmath2 quasars : one is the grain size distribution of sn - dust @xcite , and the other is the size distribution of grains processed by interstellar shattering @xcite .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explain theoretical models of dust enrichment , focusing on grain growth by accretion . in section 3",
    ", we show the results , which we discuss in more general contexts in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 gives the conclusion .",
    "we adopt a chemical evolution model that describes the time evolution of gas , metals , and dust in a galaxy . in order to focus on the effect of grain size distribution on grain growth",
    ", we adopt a simple model , which has already been shown to be applicable to nearby galaxies ( @xcite ; hk11 ) , but use parameter values suitable for high-@xmath2 ( @xmath0 ) quasars .",
    "we neglect inflow and outflow , and treat the system as a closed box .",
    "the abundances of dust and metals are tightly related , so the model equations are finally reduced to the relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity by adopting the instantaneous recycling approximation ( hk11 ) , which can be applied as long as we consider time - scales longer than the lifetime of massive stars : @xmath8_{\\rm{acc}},\\label{eq : dddx }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass abundance of element x ( x is a key element of a dust species ; x = si for silicate and x = c for carbonaceous grains ) in both gas and dust phases , @xmath10 is the mass abundance of a dust species whose key element is x , @xmath11 is the returned fraction of the mass from stars formed , @xmath12 is the mass fraction of element x that is newly produced and ejected by stars , @xmath13 is the dust condensation efficiency of the element x in the ejecta , @xmath14 is the star formation rate , @xmath15 is the destruction efficiency of dust by sn shocks ( defined below ) , and @xmath16_\\mathrm{acc}$ ] is the increasing rate of dust mass by accretion .",
    "the destruction efficiency by sn shock was introduced by @xcite as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fraction of dust destroyed in a single sn blast , and @xmath19 is the gas mass swept per sn blast , and @xmath20 is the sn rate .",

    "some quantities are eliminated .",
    "the gas mass is used to normalize the metal and dust masses to obtain @xmath9 and @xmath22 , respectively , and thus acts as a normalizing factor in our formulation .",
    "the star formation time - scale is also eliminated : changing the star formation time - scale just varies the quickness of metal and dust enrichment , leaving the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath22 unchanged .",

    "since the chemical properties of these species in grain growth is poorly known , we simply categorize them into two groups following @xcite : the carbonaceous species and the silicate species ( all the species other than c ; si is dominated ) , and hypothesize that they evolve separately and independently in molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite have calculated the grain size distribution by considering dust condensation and destruction in a sn , and have shown that small grains are efficiently trapped in the shocked region and considerably destroyed by thermal sputtering , and thus the size distribution of grains finally ejected into the ism is biased towards larger sizes . because destruction of small grains with @xmath58 is common regardless of the progenitor mass and the treatment of mixing in the he core in @xcite ( similar grain size distributions are also acquired by @xcite )",
    ", it is sufficient to examine a single representative case for the grain size distribution for sn - dust .",
    "this case is called ` grain size distribution _ without _ shattering ' .",

    "although it is difficult to constrain @xmath62 and @xmath63 from observations , this single case is sufficient to demonstrate the importance of the change of grain size distribution by shattering .",

    "we examine the relation between dust - to - gas ratio and metallicity for the grain size distribution without shattering . the result is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_metal]a . at low metallicities [ @xmath65 , the dust is simply supplied from sne , which leads to an approximately linear increase of the dust - to - gas ratio in terms of the metallicity .",
    "when @xmath22 reaches @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 for silicate and carbonaceous dust , respectively ) , the dust destruction becomes comparable to the dust supply from sne ( equation [ eq : dg_metal ] ) .",
    "thus , the increase of the dust - to - gas ratio saturates around @xmath69 . around @xmath70 ( @xmath71 z@xmath53 )",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio rapidly increases because of the nonlinearity of grain growth ( @xmath72 ; that is , grain growth occurs as a result of collisions between dust grains and metals ) in molecular clouds .",
    "as shown in hk11 , the grain growth becomes prominent at a certain critical metallicity depending on dust grain size distribution ( see section [ subsec : critical ] ) . under the size distribution without shattering , dust growth becomes prominent only after the metallicity reaches a super - solar value .",
    "this is because of inefficient grain growth caused by the large surface - to - volume ratio of dust grains .",
    "in addition , sne produce a large amount of silicate than carbonaceous dust .",
    "after grain growth in molecular clouds , the silicate species is still dominant over the carbonaceous species .",
    "if we adopt the grain size distribution with shattering , we obtain the result exhibited in fig .",

    "dust - to - gas ratio occurs at a lower metallicity , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 z@xmath53 ) , because shattering remarkably raises the surface - to - volume ratio of the dust grains .",
    "@xcite have estimated the dust and gas mass by using the millimeter continuum and co lines , respectively , for nine @xmath0 quasars .",
    "their samples show high dust - to - gas ratios from @xmath75 to @xmath76 , which could be regarded as upper limits because they did not take neutral hydrogen into account .",
    "if we alternatively utilize their dynamical mass as an upper limit for the gas mass , we then obtain @xmath77 ( assuming an inclination angle of 40@xmath78 ) to be a lower limit of the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "@xcite claim that high-@xmath2 ( @xmath0 ) quasars are likely to have super - solar metallicities ( @xmath79 z@xmath53 ) based on observations of broad line regions .",
    "narrow line regions ( nlrs ) may trace the metal content of the entire qso better , and @xcite indicate that the nlrs in quasars at @xmath80 have solar metallicities . considering that the bright qsos at @xmath0 are highly biased to the most luminous and metal - enriched systems",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the metallicities of @xmath0 qsos is @xmath81 . comparing our results with the observational lower limit of dust - to - gas ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_metal ] ) , we find that at least @xmath82 ( @xmath83 z@xmath53 ) is required to explain the lower - limit of dust - to - gas ratio if we adopt the grain size distribution without shattering .",
    "thus , a super - solar metallicity is strongly required to explain the rich dust content in high - redshift quasars . with shattering",
    ", however , the dust - to - gas ratio reaches the observational lower limit at a more moderate metallicity ( @xmath84 ; @xmath85 z@xmath53 ) because of the grain growth at a lower metallicity .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that the grain growth by accretion dominates the grain abundance if the metallicity is larger than a certain critical metallicity . according to hk11 ,",
    "the critical metallicity @xmath86 is the metallicity such that @xmath87 . for the dust grain size distribution without shattering , the critical metallicity of the silicate species and carbonaceous species are @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( @xmath714 z@xmath53 ) , respectively .",
    "these metallicities actually correspond to the metallicity levels where a strong rise of dust - to - gas ratio occurs by grain growth ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dg_metal ] ) .",
    "in contrast , for the dust grain size distribution with shattering , the critical metallicity becomes @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 z@xmath53 for silicate and carbonaceous species .",
    "the variation in the critical metallicity between the grain size distributions with and without shattering explains the difference of the metallicity level at which the dust - to - gas ratio is raised by grain growth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_metal ] ) .      according to equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) ,",
    "the hydrogen number density in molecular clouds , @xmath43 , is also an important quantity that determines the time - scale of grain growth , @xmath41 .",
    "we have presumed that @xmath93 . however , in some environments such as circumnuclear starburst regions in high-@xmath2 quasars , the physical conditions of molecular clouds can be quite different .",
    "some recent observations imply that the density in molecular clouds in high-@xmath2 quasars is higher than that in nearby galaxies @xcite . in order to investigate a possibility of a larger @xmath63",
    ", we adopt @xmath94 @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dg_metal]c , we show the result for the dust grain size distribution without shattering .",
    "we observe that higher gas density enhances grain growth and that the rapid increase of dust - to - gas ratio occurs at a lower metallicity .",
    "therefore , the grain size distribution without shattering can be reconciled with the observed dust - to - gas ratio in high-@xmath2 quasars if we assume such a high density as @xmath95 @xmath60 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) offers another possibility of enhancing grain growth .",
    "the dust mass increment @xmath96 is a function of @xmath97 . as a result",
    ", a longer lifetime of molecular clouds hosting the grain growth @xmath98 has the same effect as a shorter typical time - scale of grain growth @xmath41 , which means that @xmath99 instead of @xmath100 has the same effect as applying @xmath101 instead of @xmath93 . @xcite",
    "have indicated that the existence of sheared structure within the spiral arms in the milky way supports a lifetime of molecular clouds comparable to galactic rotational time - scales ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "moreover , the gas temperature @xmath49 and the sticking probability @xmath103 also enter the time - scale ( see equations [ eq : tau_sil ] and [ eq : tau_car ] ) ; however , since @xmath104 and @xmath103 can not be much larger than the adopted values , it is difficult to make @xmath41 shorter by changing @xmath104 or @xmath103 .",
    "the importance of grain size distribution on dust enrichment in high - redshift ( @xmath0 ) quasars has been investigated in this work .",
    "we have found that , if the grain size distribution of sn - dust is considered , very high metallicity ( @xmath105 ) is required to explain the dust - to - gas ratio of those quasars under a similar quantities to the local molecular clouds ( @xmath106 @xmath60 and @xmath107 yr ) .",
    "however , if small grains are produced by shattering , grain growth is activated and the dust - to - gas ratio in high-@xmath2 quasars can be explained by more moderate metallicities(@xmath108 z@xmath53 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dust grain size distribution has a dramatic impact on the evolution of dust content in high-@xmath2 quasars .",
