    "recently the cleo collaboration has observed@xcite the exclusive radiative decay @xmath7 with a branching fraction of @xmath8 .",
    "the inclusive @xmath9 branching ratio measured by cleo@xcite is : @xmath10 the newest upper and lower limits of this decay branching ratio are @xmath11 as a loop - induced flavor changing neutral current(fcnc ) process the inclusive decay(at quark level ) @xmath9 is in particular sensitive to contributions from those new physics beyond the standard model(sm)@xcite .",
    "there is a vast interest in this decay .",
    "the decay @xmath9 and its large leading log qcd corrections have been evaluated in the sm by several groups @xcite .",
    "the reliability of the calculations of this decay is improving as partial calculations of the next - to - leading logarithmic qcd corrections to the effective hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "on the other hand the discovery of the top quark and the measurement of its mass ( in this paper we use the weighted average @xmath12 from the announced results of @xmath13 by cdf and d0@xcite wherever possible ) at fermilab basically eliminated a source of uncertainties for the calculation of the decay @xmath9 in the sm and in beyond theories .",
    "the great progress in theoretical studies and in experiments achieved recently encourage us to do more investigations about this decay in technicolor theories .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the possible contributions to the decay @xmath9 from the exchange of the charged pseudo - goldstone bosons which will appear in no - minimal technicolor models , such as the farhi - susskind one - generation technicolor model ( ogtm ) @xcite . we know that the experimental data seems disfavor the ogtm which generally tend to predict @xmath14 parameter large and positive @xcite .",
    "why we here still choose it to do the calculations ?",
    "the reasons are the following :    \\(1 ) at first , presence of the pseudo - goldstone bosons in the particle spectrum is a common feature of those non - minimal tc models with ordinary or novel etc sectors , no matter the specific differences of structures between those models .",
    "the gauge couplings of the pgbs are determined by their quantum numbers , while the yukawa couplings of pgbs to ordinary fermions are generally proportional to fermion masses for many tc / etc models . among the non - minimal tc models ,",
    "the ogtm @xcite is the simplest and most frequently studied model .",
    "many relevant works @xcite have been done since the late 1970 s .",
    "one can use those existed results directly in further investigations .",
    "\\(2 ) on the other hand , the constraints on the @xmath14 parameter could be relaxed considerably by introducing three additional parameters @xmath15 @xcite . a global fit to the data in which all six oblique parameters s through x are allowed to vary simultaneously gives the one standard deviation bound on @xmath14 : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this fact means that the constraint on the ogtm from the parameter @xmath14 could be considerably weakened if we consider the effects from light technifermions and light pgbs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we estimate the possible contributions to the rare decay @xmath9 from the charged pgbs in the framework of the ogtm .",
    "at least , one can regard our results as an estimation for the `` correct '' output of the future `` realistic '' tc models .",
    "this paper is organized as the following : in section 2 , we present the basic ingredients of the ogtm and then calculate the pgb contributions to @xmath17 decay , together with the full leading log qcd corrections . in section 3 , we obtain the branching ratios of this decay , and derive out the constraints on masses of charged pgbs by phenomenological analysis .",
    "the conclusions are also included in this section .",
    "in the ogtm @xcite , when the technifermion condensate @xmath18 was formed , the global flavor symmetry will break as follows : @xmath19 . consequently",
    ", 63 ( pseudo)-goldstone bosons will be produced from this breaking .",
    "when all other interactions but the technicolor are turned off , these 63 goldstone bosons are exactly massless .",
    "three of them are eaten by the @xmath20 and @xmath21 gauge bosons .",
    "the others acquire masses when one turned on the gauge interactions , and therefore they are pseudo - goldstone bosons(pgbs ) .    according to previous studies ,",
    "the phenomenology of those color - singlet charged pgbs in the ogtm is very similar with that of the elementary charged higgs bosons @xmath22 of type - i two - higgs - doublet model(2hdm ) @xcite . and",
    "consequently , the contributions to the decay @xmath23 from the color - singlet charged pgbs in the ogtm will be very similar with that from charged higgs bosons in the 2hdm . as for the color - octet charged pgbs ,",
    "the situation is more complicated because of the involvement of the color interactions .",
    "other neutral pgb s do nt contribute to the rare decay @xmath9 .",
    "the gauge couplings of the pgbs are determined by their quantum numbers .",
    "the yukawa couplings of pgbs to ordinary fermions are induced by etc interactions and hence are model dependent .",
    "however , these yukawa couplings are generally proportional to fermion masses with small differences in the magnitude of the coefficients for different tc / etc models .",
    "the relevant couplings needed in our calculation are directly quoted from refs.@xcite and summarized in table [ table1 ] , where the @xmath24 is the corresponding element of kobayashi - maskawa matrix . for the ogtm ,",
    "the goldstone boson decay constant @xmath25 in table [ table1 ] should be @xmath26 , in order to ensure the correct masses for the gauge bosons @xmath21 and @xmath20 @xcite .    .",
    "the relevant gauge couplings and effective yukawa couplings for the ogtm . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in ref.@xcite , randall and sundrum have estimated the contributions to @xmath9 from the exchange of etc gauge bosons in various etc scenarios . in the case of `` traditional ''",
    "etc ( just the case which will be studied here ) , the dominant contribution to @xmath9 occurs when the etc gauge boson is exchanged between purely left - handed doublets and when the photon is emitted from the technifermion line . but the resulted etc contribution is strongly suppressed with respect to the sm by a factor of @xmath27 for @xmath28@xcite . in short ,",
    "the etc contribution to the decay @xmath23 is small and will be masked by still large experimental and theoretical uncertainties .",
    "we therefore can neglect the etc contributions to @xmath9 at present phenomenological analysis .    in fig.1 , we draw the relevant feynman diagrams which contribute to the decay @xmath9 , where the half - circle lines represent the w gauge boson of sm as well as the charged pgbs @xmath29 and @xmath30 of ogtm . in the evaluation",
    "we at first integrate out the top quark and the weak w bosons at @xmath31 scale , generating an effective five - quark theory . by using the renormalization group equation",
    ", we run the effective field theory down to b - quark scale to give the leading log qcd corrections , then at this scale , we calculate the rate of radiative @xmath32 decay .    after applying the full qcd equations of motion@xcite ,",
    "a complete set of dimension-6 operators relevant for @xmath17 decay can be chosen to be : @xmath33    the effective hamiltonian appears just below the w - scale is given as @xmath34 the coefficients of 8 operators are calculated from diagrams of fig.1 : @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 arise from graphs with w boson exchange are already known contributions from sm ; while the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 arise from diagrams with color - singlet and color - octet charged pgbs of ogtm .",

    "this can also be seen from the numerical results and discussion in the next section .",
    "the running of the coefficients of operators from @xmath31 to @xmath47 was well described in refs.@xcite .",

    "fig.2 is the plot of the branching ratio @xmath73 as a function of the top quark mass .",
    "the upper dashed curve in fig.2 represents the branching ratio in the standard model , while the solid curve shows the same ratio with the inclusion of the contributions from @xmath29 and @xmath30 assuming @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the band between two dash - dotted lines corresponds to the newest cleo limits : @xmath76 at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath78 with large contribution from ogtm , is much more sensitive with the top quark mass , compared with the case of pure sm .",
    "it is known from the decoupling theorem that for heavy enough nonstandard boson , we should recover the sm result .",
    "so for sufficiently large values of @xmath6 , @xmath79 ( e.g. @xmath80gev , @xmath81gev ) , the contributions from ogtm shall be negligible .",
    "this can also be seen from the fact that the functions @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 go to zero , as @xmath82,@xmath83 . for",
    "not so large @xmath6 , @xmath79 , the ogtm contribution cancels much of the sm contribution because of the relative minus sign between their contribution . as a result",
    ", the branching of @xmath84 reached the lower limit of the cleo experiment .",
    "so a large region of @xmath6 , @xmath79 ( i.e. @xmath85 , for all @xmath6 ) is ruled out .",
    "when @xmath6 , @xmath79 go on smaller , their contribution is about two times as large as contribution of sm ( recall there is a relative minus sign ) , the branching ratio of @xmath78 resumes to experiment allowed region .",
    "but if the @xmath6 , @xmath79 are smaller enough , the contribution of ogtm is more larger , the region is also excluded by the upper limit of cleo experiment",
    ". the whole result is illustrated at fig.3 , large part of the parameter space in the @xmath86 plane can be excluded according to the current @xmath1 95% c.l .",
    "limits on the ratio @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that no direct limits on @xmath88 can be obtained at present for free @xmath79 , but at the same time , one can simply read out the lower bound on the mass of color octet pgbs : @xmath89 for free @xmath6 ( assuming @xmath90 ) , if we simply interpret the @xmath1 @xmath91 limits on the ratio @xmath87 as the bounds on the masses of charged pgbs .    of cause",
    ", we have not considered the effects of other possible uncertainties , such as that of @xmath92 , next - to - leading - log qcd contribution@xcite , qcd correction from @xmath93 to @xmath94@xcite etc .",
    "the inclusion of those additional uncertainties will broaden the border lines between the allowed regions and excluded regions in fig.3 .",
    "the limitations drawn from the calculations will be surely weaken , i.e. , the lower limit will become @xmath95 at @xmath96 if we include an additional @xmath97 theoretical uncertainties .    as a conclusion , the size of contribution to the rare decay of @xmath9 from the pgbs strongly depends on the values of the masses of the top quark and the charged pgbs .",
    "this is quite different from the sm case . by the comparison of the theoretical prediction with the current data one can derives out the constraints on the masses of the color octet charged pgbs : @xmath98 at @xmath96 for free @xmath88 , assuming @xmath90 .",
