    "in general , the transport phenomena in metals are very important physical objects because they offer much information on many - body electronic properties of the system . especially in strongly correlated electron systems like high - tc cuprates or heavy fermion systems , various transport coefficients show striking non - fermi liquid type behaviors .",
    "historically , theoretical studies on transport phenomena give considerable progresses in various fields of the condensed matter physics , such as kondo problem and high - tc superconductivity .    according to the linear response theory @xcite or the kubo formula @xcite ,",
    "transport coefficients are given by corresponding current - current correlation functions .",
    "thus , to study transport phenomena , we need to calculate the two - body green function with appropriate vertex corrections ( vc s ) .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases it is a difficult analytical or numerical work .",
    "therefore , at the present stage , transport coefficients are usually studied within the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) , by dropping all the vc s .",
    "the effect of the vc can be included by the standard variational method by ziman based on the boltzmann transport theory @xcite however , it is not so powerful for anisotropic correlated systems because there is no systematic way of choosing the trial function .",
    "thus , it is desired to establish the microscopic transport theory based on the linear response formula .",
    "based on the kubo formula , eliashberg derived a general expression for the dc - conductivity ( @xmath8 ) in the fermi liquid by taking the vc s into account , by performing the analytic continuation of the current - current correlation functions @xcite .",
    "based on the expression , yamada and yosida proved rigorously that @xmath7 diverges even at finite temperatures if the umklapp scattering process is absent . @xcite . by generalizing the eliashberg s theory including the outer magnetic field ,",
    "the exact formulae for the hall coefficient ( @xmath9 ) @xcite and the magnetoresistance ( @xmath10 ) @xcite in fermi liquid systems were derived . by using these formulae , in principle",
    ", we can perform the conserving approximation for these coefficients with including appropriate vc s for currents @xcite .    in general , the vc s for currents are expected to be important especially in strongly correlated systems . for example , in high - tc cuprates , the so - called kohler s rule ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) is strongly violated @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath13 in electron - doped compounds , although the shape of the fermi surface is everywhere hole - like .",
    "these behaviors , which can not be explained within the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) , had been an open problem in high - tc cuprates . based on the conserving approximation , we found that these anomalies are well reproduced by the vc s for electron currents @xcite .",
    "the effect of the vc s , which are dropped in the rta , becomes much important in a fermi liquid with strong antiferromagnetic or superconducting fluctuations .",
    "however , as for the thermoelectric transport coefficients such as the thermoelectric power ( tep , @xmath0 ) , the nernst coefficient ( @xmath1 ) , and the thermal conductivity ( @xmath2 ) , we do not know useful expressions for analysis in the strongly correlated systems so far .",
    "here , the definition of @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 under the magnetic filed @xmath14 parallel to the @xmath15-axis are given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the heat current .",
    "unfortunately , the conserving approximation for these coefficients is not practicable because we do not know how to calculate the vc s for them .",
    "thus , at the present stage , only the rta is accessible , which will be insufficient for a reliable analysis of the strongly correlated systems because vc s should be included .",
    "there is a long history of the microscopic study on thermoelectric transport phenomena . to this problem",
    ", we can not apply the kubo formula to the electronic conductivity naively because there is no hamiltonian which describes a temperature gradient @xmath18 . in 1964",
    "luttinger gave a microscopic proof that thermoelectric transport coefficients are given by the corresponding current - current correlation function @xcite .",
    "later , mahan et al . much simplified the luttinger s expression in the case of electron - phonon and electron - impurity interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of the vc for the heat current for electron - electron interacting systems is still an open problem , which is necessary to go beyond the rta",
    ". this analysis will be more complicated and profound than that for the electric conductivity performed by eliashberg @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we derive the thermoelectric transport coefficients by performing the analytic continuations of the current - current correlation functions , on the basis of the linear response theory developed by luttinger or mahan .",
    "our expressions are valid for general two - body interactions .",
    "the vc for the heat current is given without ambiguity by the ward identity with respect to the local energy conservation law .",
    "the derived expressions are `` exact '' as for the most divergent term with respect to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the quasiparticle damping rate .",
    "the present work enables us to perform the `` conserving approximation '' for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which is highly demanded to avoid unphysical results .",
    "actually , the vc s would totally modify the behavior of these quantities in strongly correlated electron systems , as it does for the hall effect and the magnetoresistance . in this respect ,",
    "the rta is unsatisfactory because all the current vc s are neglected there .",
    "we note that langer studied the ward identity for the heat current , and discussed the thermal conductivity @xcite . however , the derived ward identity was not correct as explained in  iii , although it did not influence the thermal conductivity at lower temperatures fortunately .",
    "we derive the correct ward identity in  iii , and give expressions for @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in thermodynamics ,",
    "the tep of metals becomes zero at absolute zero temperature , which is the consequence of `` the third law of the thermodynamics '' .",
    "( as is well known , the third law also tells that the heat capacity vanishes at @xmath21 . )",
    "similarly , both @xmath1 and @xmath2 also become zero at @xmath21 if the quasiparticle relaxation time @xmath22 is finite at @xmath21 due to impurity scatterings . unfortunately ,",
    "these indisputable facts are nontrivial in a naive perturbation study once the electron - electron correlations are set in . in the present work ,",
    "we derive the general expression for @xmath0 which automatically satisfy @xmath23 owing to the ward identity for the heat velocity .",
    "in high - tc cuprates , the nernst coefficient @xmath1 increases drastically below the pseudo - gap temperature , which is never possible to explain within the rta @xcite .",
    "according to recent theoretical works , superconducting ( sc ) fluctuation is one of the promising origins of the pseudo - gap phenomena @xcite .",
    "based on the opinion , we studied @xmath1 for high - tc cuprates using the general expression derived in the present paper @xcite .",
    "then , we could reproduce the rapid increase of @xmath1 only when the vc s due to the strong antiferromagnetic and superconducting fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "this work strongly suggests that the origin of the pseudo - gap phenomena in high - tc cuprates is the strong @xmath24-wave superconducting fluctuations .    in the case of heavy fermion systems",
    ", the tep takes an enhanced value around the coherent temperature , and its sign changes in some compounds at lower temperatures .",
    "such an interesting non - fermi liquid like behavior is mainly attributed to a huge energy dependence of the relaxation time , @xmath25 , due to the kondo resonance .",
    "this phenomenon was studied by using the dynamical mean field theory @xcite .",
    "also , the tep in the kondo insulator was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "the contents of this paper are as follows : in  ii , we develop the linear response theory for thermoelectric transport coefficients . by performing the analytic continuation , we derive the general formula of @xmath0 and @xmath2 in the presence of the on - site coulomb potential @xmath6 . in  iii , we derive the ward identity for the heat velocity which is valid for general two - body interactions , by using the local energy conservation law .",
    "the ward identity assures that the expressions for @xmath0 and @xmath2 derived in the previous section are valid even if the range of the interaction is finite , as for the most divergent terms with respect to @xmath26 . in ",
    "iv , the general formula for @xmath1 is derived .",
    "it is rather a complicated task because the gauge invariance should be maintained . in ",
    "v , we calculate @xmath2 in a spherical correlated electron system in the absence of umklapp process , and obtain its exact expression by including the vc s within the second order perturbation .",
    "the physical meaning of the vc is discussed .",
    "finally , the summary of the present work is shortly expressed in ",
    "first , we shortly summarize the linear response theory for thermoelectric transport coefficients , initiated by luttinger . here",
    "we consider the situation that both the electron current @xmath27 and the heat current @xmath28 are caused by the external forces @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the electric field . in the linear response ,",
