    "the distance of 1.76 kpc , similar to the statistical distance of 1.69 kpc provided by @xcite , will be used hereafter .",
    "the cspn of a30 is confirmed to be very hot ( @xmath10kk ) , and the emission line spectrum originates from a stellar wind composed predominantly of helium , carbon and oxygen , which is typical for the [ wc ] spectral type .    besides small changes in the values of the stellar temperature and helium and carbon abundances ,",
    "the present results do not differ appreciably from those previously reported by @xcite based on a much earlier version of our model atmosphere code without the inclusion of iron - line blanketing .",
    "the major difference between the current and earlier calculations , however , is induced by the inclusion of clumping and mass - loss rate ( @xmath11 ) effects . in the `` microclumping '' approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the emission line fit yields the product @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the so - called `` clumping factor '' , is difficult to constrain .",

    "the only study for the wind of a cspn @xcite came to a similar result , although this parameter was poorly constrained .",

    "it is interesting to compare these chemical abundances with those of the hydrogen - deficient knots , where the he : c : n : o element number ratio is 100:4.0:2.7:11.6 @xcite",
    ". the low c / o ratio of the hydrogen - poor knots , @xmath20.3 , is at variance with the stellar wind , and is also in contradiction to theoretical models of born - again pne that predict c / o higher than unity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , the spectral fit of the uv and optical spectra of a30 ( fig.[fig : linefit ] ) has allowed us to build its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) shown in figure[fig : sed ] .",
    "the fit of the sed shown in fig.[fig : sed ] requires only a small interstellar reddening with @xmath15=0.18@xmath16mag that corresponds to a hydrogen column density @xmath17=(6.8@xmath31.9)@xmath710@xmath18 @xmath19 according to the relation @xmath17/@xmath15=3.8@xmath710@xmath20",
    "@xmath19  mag@xmath4 prescribed by @xcite .",
    "we note that the interstellar extinction law of @xcite used to deredden the observed spectral data does not reproduce properly the uv absorption at @xmath22470   which is attributed to carbonaceous dust @xcite , and thus the value of the hydrogen column density given above is suspect .",
    "the original _ hst _ wfpc2 narrow - band [ o  iii ] images of a30 ( fig .",
    "[ img.opt]-_right_ ) were obtained on 1994 march 6 ( epoch 1994.2 ) , but we noticed that the _ hst _ archive also contained wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) images obtained through the f555w filter on 2009 december 31 ( epoch 2010.0 ) .",
    "it is reasonable to compare these images , taken @xmath215.8 yr apart , because the nebular emission registered by the f555w filter is mostly dominated by the [ o  iii ] emission lines .",
    "such comparison indeed unveils the proper motion of the hydrogen - poor knots of a30 , as shown in figure  [ fig : exp ] . following the method used by @xcite to study the angular expansion of ngc6543",
    ", we have magnified the earlier epoch image ( the f502n image ) by several factors and produced the residual maps shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] .",
    "these maps suggest that the hydrogen - poor knots of a30 have expanded @xmath22% .",
    "a detailed analysis of the location of both bipolar and equatorial knots along different directions in the images of the two epochs has allowed us to refine this result and conclude that the 1994.2 image needs to be magnified by 1.019@xmath30.003 in order to match the 2010.0 image .",
    "such 1.9% expansion in a time lapse of 15.8 yr implies an expansion age of 850@xmath0 yr that can be interpreted as the time since the born - again episode took place circa ad 1160 .",
    "the angular expansion rate can also be used to estimate the averaged expansion velocity of the knots in the equatorial ring . assuming that the equatorial ring is circular in shape , its major axis lies on the plane of the sky and thus the semimajor axis of 48 implies a radius of 0.041 pc at a distance of 1.76 kpc . for an age of 850 yr , an averaged expansion velocity of @xmath250 km  s@xmath4",
    "is derived .",
    "finally , we note the presence of a star @xmath2525 from the cspn of a30 at pa@xmath2144 .",
    "the possible physical connection of this star with the cspn of a30 was used by @xcite to estimate a distance of 2020  pc toward a30 .",
    "the comparison between the 1994.2 and 2010.0 epoch images reveals a change of 015 in the position of this star relative to the location of the cspn of a30 .",
    "this shift is much larger than the orbital motion expected in the time lapse of 15.8 yr for a companion star with the orbital separation of 10,580 au estimated by @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that this star and the cspn of a30 do not form a binary system , but they are rather optical doubles .",
    "consequently , the distance estimate of 2020 pc is not valid and should not be used .",

    "after excising these periods from the data , the resulting useful exposure times amount to 31.63 ks for epic - mos1 , 31.31 ks for epic - mos2 , 24.58 ks for epic - pn , 31.81 ks for rgs1 and 31.53 ks for rgs2 .",

    "the small - scale spatial distribution of the x - ray emission is revealed by the comparison between the _ chandra _ acis - s and _ hst _ wfpc2 [ o  iii ] images shown in figure  [ img.xopt]-_left_. most of the emission detected in the _ chandra _ acis - s image corresponds to a point source coincident with the central star of a30 , but some additional emission , 8.2@xmath33.5 counts , is found @xmath24  to the southwest of a30 cspn .",
    "this emission is soft , with a median energy @xmath20.30 kev , and seems spatially coincident with an [ o  iii ] bright knot in the equatorial ring of the hydrogen - poor ejecta .",
    "given the extremely low count level of the acis - s background in the soft energy band , @xmath20.025 counts  arcsec@xmath21 , the probability that this source were a statistical fluctuation in the background is negligible , @xmath2210@xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ img.xopt ] shows that this source is coincident with one of the brightest patches of diffuse x - ray emission suggested by _ rosat _",
    "hri images @xcite .",
    "the large - scale spatial distribution of the x - ray emission is illustrated by the comparison between the _ xmm - newton _ epic and ground - based [ o  iii ] images shown in figures  [ fig : ximg ] and [ img.xopt]-_right_. the x - ray emission in the _ xmm - newton _ epic image peaks at the location of the central star , in agreement with the _ chandra _ acis - s image . the image does not show any obvious diffuse x - ray emission associated with the round outer shell of a30 .",
    "instead , the x - ray peak at the central star is surrounded by a `` halo '' of diffuse emission whose spatial distribution is consistent with that revealed by _ rosat",
    "_ pspc observations at a poorer spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "there is a tantalizing correlation between the _ xmm - newton _ epic x - ray contours of this diffuse x - ray emission and the `` petals of the cloverleaf '' pattern interior to the round outer shell .    to further assess whether this x - ray emission is extended ,",
    "we have used the sas 10.0 task `` eradial '' to extract a radial profile of the x - ray emission from a30 and fit it to the theoretical _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn psf that can be described as a king function with core 55 and exponent 1.6 .",
    "however , a direct fit to the radial profile has yielded inconclusive results because a30 is located at @xmath270  from a chip gap in the epic - pn camera , and thus does not allow the extraction of a sufficiently extended radial profile to accurately assess the background level for the psf fit .",
    "the epic - mos images are not useful for this purpose as they lack sufficient statistical significance .    to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "we have compared a bright , soft point source ( nova lmc1995 , * ? ? ? * ) with a30 .",
    "a preliminary inspection of the soft images of a30 and nova lmc1995 is also inconclusive because nova lmc1995 also seems to be surrounded by a halo of diffuse emission most likely associated with the psf of the epic - pn .",
    "a close comparison of the radial profiles of a30 and nova lmc1995 ( figure  [ psf]-_left _ ) built using the sas task `` eradial '' finally found evidence suggesting that the radial profile of a30 departs from that of a point source at distances @xmath2413 . to reinforce this result",

    "the comparison , shown in figure  [ psf]-_right _ , confirms that a30 shows additional emission peaks at distances @xmath2413 , further strengthening the conclusion that a30 displays extended x - ray emission .",
    "the limited spatial resolution of the _ xmm - newton _ epic - pn observations , however , makes it impossible to estimate the extent and distribution of this diffuse emission within 20  from the central star of a30 .",
    "an attempt to remove the emission from the point source has been made by using a point source model derived from the observation of nova lmc1995 and scaled to the emission peak of the cspn of a30 .",
    "the residual diffuse emission is basically consistent with the contours shown in figure  [ img.xopt]-_right_.      to study the spectral properties of the x - ray emission from a30 , we have extracted the epic - pn and epic - mos background - subtracted spectra of a30 shown in figure  [ xspec_all]-_left_. the spectra are extremely soft even when compared to those of diffuse emission from other pne ( e.g. , ngc6543 , * ? ? ?",

    "there is much fainter emission at @xmath20.58 kev , but no further emission is detected above 0.6 kev .",
    "a comparison with optically thin plasma emission models of different chemical abundances suggests that the emission at 0.35 kev may correspond to either the c  vi lines at 33.7   ( @xmath250.37 kev ) or the c  v lines at 35.0   ( @xmath250.35 kev ) , while the weak feature at 0.58 kev seems consistent with the o  vii triplet at 21.8   ( @xmath250.57 kev ) .",
    "similarly , the rapid decline above 0.35 kev seems consistent with plasma emission models for which the contribution from the n  vi 0.43 kev and n  vii 0.50 kev emission lines is rather small .",
    "the rgs spectrum of a30 , despite having a limited signal - to - noise ratio ( figure  [ xspec_all]-_right _ ) , has allowed us to identify the emission peak in the epic - pn spectrum of a30 as the ly@xmath1 line of c  vi at 33.7   ( @xmath250.37 kev ) and to confirm that there is no significant contribution from nitrogen lines .",
    "since the analysis of the radial profile of x - ray emission from a30 reveals extended emission , we have extracted separate spectra for the central source from a circular region of radius 12  and for the diffuse emission from an annular region with a 20  inner radius and a 35  outer radius .",

    "the comparison of the spectra of the diffuse emission and point source suggests spectral differences , with the diffuse emission spectrum lacking the peak at @xmath20.37 kev associated with the c  vi line and having a relatively more important contribution of the o  vii triplet at 0.57 kev .",
    "the epic and rgs spectra of a30 imply the presence of emission lines , thus suggesting that the x - ray emission from a30 can be modeled using an optically thin plasma emission model .",

    "the stellar winds of cspne are radiatively driven , i.e. , the stellar wind s momentum is provided by radiation pressure on spectral lines .",
    "we can thus expect that the hydrodynamic instability , which is inherent to radiatively driven stellar winds , will lead to shocks embedded in the stellar wind and produce x - ray emission as for the stellar winds of ob and wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the wind is basically transparent down to the photosphere at 20    ( 0.62 kev ) , but at longer wavelengths , the opacity increases and the wind stays optically thick out to 7 stellar radii above 50   ( 0.25 kev ) .",

    "a small fraction of this mechanical luminosity would be able to power the x - ray emission which is observed at the central source of a30 .",
    "as for the diffuse x - ray emission detected in other pne , the present stellar wind can be heated when it rams into previously ejected slower material to form a hot bubble .",
    "the situation in a30 is different from other pne due to its born - again history : while the hot bubble of the old , large pn has faded out , a `` born - again hot bubble '' , powered by the present wind , may be responsible of the x - ray emission at the central source .",

    "ion - ion charge transfer processes , considered for the production of x - ray emission in the winds of hot stars @xcite , is plausible as the large kinetic energy of the ions in the stellar wind of a30 can overcome the coulumb repulsion of carbon and oxygen ions in the knots . on the other hand ,",
    "neutralization of highly ionized ions on the surface of dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "an upper limit of the x - ray luminosity produced by charge transfer reactions can be computed from the following relation @xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the wind terminal velocity , @xmath76 is the wind ion density at the location of the neutral material , @xmath77 is the fraction of ions capable of releasing an x - ray photon in a charge - exchange reaction , @xmath78 is the photon energy , and @xmath79 is the cross - section of the hydrogen - poor knots .",

    "4.3.4 , the spectrum of the diffuse emission of a30 is dominated by the c  v 0.31 kev line . using the energy of the c  v line , assuming all carbon atoms are found as c  vi with a particle fraction of 0.09 derived from the chemical abundances of the wind , and adopting a ring - like structure 5  in radius and 05 tall for the estimate of the cross - section , the expected x - ray luminosity is 2.6@xmath710@xmath51 erg  s@xmath4 for the present fast stellar wind and 2.6@xmath710@xmath52 erg  s@xmath4 for the post - born - again wind .",
    "these figures show that the post - born - again wind may produce significant x - ray emission through charge transfer reactions , whereas the present fast stellar wind can not .",
    "a similar result can be reached for the x - ray emission at the cspn , where the greater density of the stellar wind at close locations of the cspn ( 0.12 @xmath56 at 05 from the cspn ) is compensated by the smaller cross - section , so that the maximum attainable x - ray luminosity would be @xmath25.7@xmath710@xmath69 erg  s@xmath4 .",

    "<S> the spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse x - ray emission is highly suggestive that it is generated by the post - born - again and present fast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen - poor ejecta of the born - again event . </S>",
    "<S> this emission can be attributed to shock - heated plasma , as the hydrogen - poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds , under which circumstances the efficient mass - loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its density and damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> charge transfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of the born - again ejecta has also been considered as a possible mechanism for the production of diffuse x - ray emission , and upper limits on the expected x - ray production by this mechanism have been derived . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the x - ray emission from the central star of a30 is puzzling : shocks in the present fast stellar wind and photospheric emission can be ruled out , while the development of a new , compact hot bubble confining the fast stellar wind seems implausible . </S>"
