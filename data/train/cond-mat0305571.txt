    "we consider first the case @xmath80 . as the gas approaches the instability points for demixing or collapse as given by eq.([hom_cond ] ) , we observe a softening of the particle - hole spectrum until most of the oscillator strength is transferred to the bosonic mode at the point of collapse or demixing ( see the first panel in figure [ fig1 ] ) . in the case",

    "we investigate how the spectrum of collective excitations is modified as the confined cloud moves toward demixing or collapse .",
    "important differences arise from the presence of the confinement , under which both the bogoliubov sound and the fermionic particle - hole spectrum are quantized .",
    "in particular the discrete energy levels depend on the static hartree - fock fields and shift as we vary the coupling strength , so that we know _ a priori _ that the spectra will not be symmetric under a change in the sign of @xmath89 .    for the finite system we follow the usual convention of evaluating the spectral strength functions @xmath104 @xcite , which are defined as @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the intensities of the time - dependent external potentials driving the two atomic species . in the case of spherical confinement",
    "these have the form @xmath107 and correspondingly we can decompose the response functions into components of definite angular momentum , @xmath108 in these equations @xmath109 are the spherical harmonic functions and @xmath110 denotes the unit vector along @xmath111 .    phase separation into",

    "the cloud responds to a monopolar excitation with only two well - defined modes , a purely fermionic one at frequency @xmath120 @xcite and a purely bosonic one at frequency @xmath121 @xcite .",
    "the latter , of course , is not present in the fermionic spectrum for @xmath122 . upon turning on the boson - fermion interactions the bosonic peak appears in the fermionic strength function with a considerable oscillator strength , showing that due to the boson - fermion coupling the fermionic cloud can oscillate in resonance with the bosons even in the collisionless regime .",
    "this `` bosonic '' mode moves to higher frequency as @xmath15 is increased , analogously to what is found in the homogeneous mixture .",
    "a second `` bosonic '' peak also appears in the fermionic strength function , corresponding to a mode at @xmath123 in the absence of boson - fermion coupling .",
    "this @xmath124 mode is not excited by a monopolar perturbation in a pure bosonic cloud , but is excited in the mixture due to the dynamical coupling between bosons and fermions . within the rpa the fermionic density fluctuations act as further perturbing fields on the bosons , and _ vice versa_. .",
    "for values of the frequency close to the original purely fermionic peak we observe a strong fragmentation of the strength function , most of which is already present at mean - field level in the hartree - fock fermionic spectrum .",
    "this fragmentation , which has also been reported for other choices of system parameters @xcite , is due to boson - fermion interactions lifting the angular degeneracy of the single - particle levels for fermions in the trap .",
    "in addition to fragmentation we observe a softening of the original fermionic spectrum .",
    "the softening stops when the topology of the cloud changes , with the opening of a hole in the fermionic density at the trap center , although strong overlap of the two clouds is still present .",
    "this dynamical transition has also been found in the collisional regime @xcite and occurs in both regimes at the same point , which is well described by the analytical expression ( [ ec : sounddemix ] ) . for larger values of the boson - fermion coupling the original fermionic component of the spectrum",
    "moves upward , again in analogy with the behavior of a trapped mixture in the collisional regime @xcite .",
    "this effect is intrinsically due to the harmonic confinement : at increasing @xmath15 the fermion cloud forms a shell around the bosons with increasing average density and decreasing thickness , thus increasing its stiffness in response to the monopolar perturbation . in the homogeneous system instead the softening of the fermionic spectrum continues up to the point of full thermodynamic separation .",
    "the role of the number of bosons in the cloud is also evident from figure  [ fig : spec0 ] .    as in sec .",
    "[ sec_hom ] , it is possible to monitor the softening or hardening of a part of the spectrum in the trapped cloud by looking at the `` minus - one '' moment of the monopolar spectral strength distribution .",
    "this spectral moment is specially sensitive to the low - frequency part of the spectrum and , owing to the kramers - kronig relations , yields the static limit @xmath125 of the strength function , thus defining four generalized compressibilities which measure the reaction of the cloud to a radial pressure exerted on a given component . in fig .",

    "the four compressibilities in the trapped cloud have a nonsymmetric behavior for positive and negative values of the boson - fermion coupling .",

    "for example , in the homogeneous gas one always finds a negative value of -@xmath127 for @xmath28 irrespectively of the actual values of the densities , whereas as is shown in fig .",

    "the amount of the shift can be predicted analytically in the limit @xmath128 , where the interactions with the bosons simply renormalize the trap frequency ( see appendix [ appa ] ) . in the same limit",
    "the bosonic modes are almost unaffected by the interactions with the fermions , as the fermionic hartree field becomes almost negligible for the bosons .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have studied how the mutual interactions of bosons and fermions affect the spectrum of collective excitations of a dilute boson - fermion mixture in the collisionless regime as the mixture goes towards either demixing or collapse . to this purpose",

    "we have also derived a dynamical condition for the two instabilities , which coincides with that obtained by studying the linear stability of the mean - field energy functional .    in the trapped system",
    "we have studied the @xmath112 monopolar excitations . while in the absence of interactions the spectrum of density fluctuations shows only two sharp and independent modes , the boson - fermion coupling induces fragmentation of the original fermionic mode , revealing the presence of many occupied single - particle levels in the fermi sphere . at increased repulsive couplings we observe a softening of the spectrum up to the point where the topology of the fermionic cloud changes by the formation of a hole at its center .",
    "the spectrum is then shifted to higher values of the frequencies at larger values of @xmath15 . for negative values of the coupling",
