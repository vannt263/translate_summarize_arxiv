    "a classical problem in studying the helmholtz equation @xmath0 is that of finding a physically meaningful criterion for uniqueness of solutions .",
    "when @xmath1 is real ( and nonzero ) and @xmath2 is a real - valued function , the sommerfeld radiation condition ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and the rellich theorem @xcite are the basis for such studies .",
    "many papers have been written to extend the sommerfeld and rellich radiation conditions to situation in which the index of refraction @xmath2 has special properties . if the refraction index tends to a constant @xmath3 in all directions ( with an appropriate behaviour ) , the usual uniqueness assumption is given by the so - called outgoing sommerfeld radiation condition @xmath4 uniformly ; here , @xmath5 is the dimension of the space and @xmath6 is the radial variable . under the same assumptions , rellich condition is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ball of radius @xmath6 and @xmath9 is the surface element .",
    "both the conditions above say something about the geometry of the level sets of the phase of the solution : they are circles at leading order and their radii grow at a specific rate .",
    "when such homogeneity condition at infinity of the refraction index is perturbed , it is unclear which should be the right geometry .",
    "many papers have been written on this topic ; we refer to section 1 in @xcite and references therein for a more detailed description of known results .",
    "moreover , _",
    "large _ perturbations of some fixed refraction index could change the rate of growing of the radii of the level sets of the phase function ( that correspond to the right choice of the propagation constant in the radiation condition ) .    in this paper",
    "a step forward in those directions is given for the helmholtz equation @xmath10 u = f , \\quad ( x , z ) \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is of the form @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 is a real - valued function of bounded variation of the variable @xmath14 , with @xmath15 positive constants and @xmath16 is a perturbing term satisfying certain hypothesis to be specified later .",
    "our work is motivated by the study of infinite open waveguides.under the _ weakly guiding approximation _",
    "( see @xcite ) , and for @xmath17 , describes the electromagnetic wave propagation in an optical or acoustical waveguide , where @xmath1 is the wavenumber and @xmath2 is the index of refraction .",
    "the peculiarity of the problem is the fact that the index of refraction @xmath2 is not a compact or _ small _ perturbation of the plane , and it may cause the appearance of _ guided modes _ , i.e. waves which propagates ( each one with a different constant of propagation ) in the @xmath18-direction without decaying .",
    "we will call _ radiating waves _ the waves that are not guided by the waveguide .",
    "our work is based on the knowledge of a green s function @xmath19 for the non - perturbed ( @xmath17 ) helmholtz equation @xmath20 with @xmath2 given by ; as done in @xcite , such a green s function can be found by using titchmarsh theory @xcite on eigenfunction expansions .",
    "we will make use of the results and notations in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ( where the case @xmath21 is deeply studied ) and @xcite and @xcite ( for the expression of the green s function in the general case ) .    due to the presence of guided modes , the usual sommerfeld radiation condition does not guarantee the uniqueness of solutions .",
    "the conditions proposed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide the uniqueness for the helmholtz equation in stratified media and they consist in a collection of sommerfeld - like conditions for all guided components of the field and for the radiative component , each of them having its own wavenumber . in @xcite,@xcite ,",
    "the author studies the case of a stratified medium with compactly supported inhomogeneities and gives a radiation condition in the spirit of . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "analogous results are obtained by using an integral formulation of the radiation condition . in the present paper",
    ", we improve the mentioned results in the following sense : ( i ) we weaken the radiation condition ( we use a radiation condition which is in the spirit of ) ; ( ii ) we consider inhomogeneities that can be extended to infinity in the direction of the waveguide but have to be small in some sense ( see ( h2 ) later ) .",

    "both condition and say that the level sets of the phase of the radiating part of the solution are given by the sets @xmath34 .",
    "an asymptotical approximation of the sets @xmath34 may be also used in the radiation conditions ( in particular , it may be also a ball ) ; we prefer to use the sets @xmath35 because they lighten the analysis the asymptotic behaviour of the green s function ( see @xcite ) . regarding guided waves , and do not seem to distinguish which is the right geometry of the level sets , even if both of them ensure the uniqueness of the problem .",
    "we notice that guided waves are one dimensional solutions of the helmholtz equation and thus the level sets of the phase function are just straight lines in the @xmath14-direction .",
    "in this paper we provide a radiation condition of sommerfeld - rellich type which guarantees the uniqueness of solutions of , with @xmath2 given by and where @xmath36 is such that    1 .",
    "@xmath37 for @xmath38 for some positive @xmath39 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath16 satisfies @xmath40    here , @xmath19 is the green s function for the unperturbed stratified medium mentioned above ( see section [ section preliminaries ] for more details ) . in particular",
    ", we are assuming that the perturbation is small in some sense and has compact support in the direction transversal to the waveguide .",
    "our first result is the following :    [ teo1 ] let @xmath16 satisfy assumptions ( h1 ) and ( h2 ) .",

    "we notice that theorem [ teo1 ] still holds if we consider the following radiation condition @xmath43 we prefer to use because it better describes the behaviour of guided modes : ( i ) the sets @xmath42 suggest the geometry of the level sets of the guided modes ( which are straight lines in the @xmath14-direction ) ; ( ii ) the presence of @xmath44 suggests that guided modes are lower dimensional solution of the helmholtz equation .    the latter result of this paper concerns the existence of a solution satisfying .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath16 satisfies the following additional assumption :    1 .",
    "@xmath45 is such that @xmath46 for some constant @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "then , our result is the following :    [ teo2 ] let @xmath49 and @xmath16 satisfy the assumptions ( h1 ) and ( h3 ) and assume that @xmath16 satisfies ( h2 ) , too .",
    "then , there exist a unique bounded solution of satisfying the radiation condition .",
    "in particular , such a solution is the only bounded solution of the following integral equation : @xmath50 d\\xi d{\\zeta}.\\ ] ]    we notice that , if the waveguide is not rectilinear , the propagation constants @xmath24 become complex ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ teo2 ] guarantees that , under the given assumptions , the propagation constants of the radiating and guided parts of the solution are ( approximately ) the same as in the unperturbed case and still guarantee the existence and uniqueness of a solution . to the author s knowledge , it is not known if the exponent @xmath51 in ( h3 ) can be improved ( see also @xcite for the case of non - stratified medium ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ section preliminaries ]",
    ", we recall and prove some preliminary results which will be useful in the rest of the paper .    theorem [ teo1 ]",
    "will be proved in section [ section uniqueness ] .",
    "the technique used is in the spirit of classical results on the helmholtz equation , in particular those contained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other techniques may be used to prove such theorem ( for instance , the limiting absorption principle , see @xcite and @xcite ) ; we shall include our proof of theorem [ teo1 ] because it is simple and direct .",
    "in section [ section existence ] we will prove theorem [ teo2 ] . here ,",
    "a careful analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of the solution is done .",
    "similar arguments for the free space case can be found in @xcite .",
    "we wish to mention that our approach can be generalized to stratified media in higher dimensions and in more general unbounded domains .",
    "clearly , stratified media in higher dimensions may present more than one kind of stratification ( in three dimensions , for instance , planar or cylindrical stratifications lead to different behaviours of the solution ) .",
    "once a uniform asymptotic expansion of the green s function is known , then it is possible to use the same technique in this paper and obtain analogous results",
