    "_ chandra s _ sub - arcsecond resolution routinely images tens to hundreds of x - ray sources in individual observations of galaxies out to virgo - cluster distances down to detection limits of @xmath2 erg s@xmath1 . in analogy with the milky way ,",
    "these are mostly x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "detection limits are of order 10 counts , corresponding to count rates of several @xmath3 c s@xmath1 for typical exposure times of 10 to 100 ks so that meaningful lightcurves can only be obtained for the most luminous sources and only over time intervals of order 1 day at most . in rare cases ,",
    "these lightcurves display periodic dips or other structures that can be used to constrain properties of the xrbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "multi - epoch x - ray observations of nearby galaxies allows for the study of the long - term variability of their x - ray source populations .",
    "we know from previous temporal and spectral analysis on the most luminous xrbs in nearby galaxies that they exhibit behaviours similar to what is seen in the galactic xrbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for example , @xcite find that among the 204 sources detected in the nearby spiral galaxy m31 , 50 per cent are variable on the time - scale of several weeks and 13 are transients .",
    "we expect that ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , defined as extranuclear point - like sources of x - rays with @xmath4 erg s@xmath1 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exhibit similar very - long - term modulations to those seen in the galactic xrb population .    owing to the lack of regular , multi - epoch observations of extragalactic xrbs , not much is known about their variability on time - scales of tens to hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "shorter time - scales can also be challenging for a variety of reasons : ( a ) count rates are always too low to see very short fluctuations like pulse periods ; ( b ) a few short , presumably orbital , modulations have been detected in rare cases in which the modulations occur 23 or more times within a single observation ; however , these required exposure times in the 10100 ks range , yet the typical _ chandra _ exposure times reported here are less than this ; and ( c ) transient - like behaviour  in which variations in luminosity are by a factor of 100 or greater  can almost always only be seen in multi - epoch exposures ( typically separated by of order 100 days ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "notable exceptions are some of the super - soft sources that vary rapidly within a given observation as well as between observations @xcite .",
    "thus , there are only a handful of examples of category ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "however , @xcite demonstrated that regular pointed x - ray observations can be successfully deployed as monitoring instruments for extragalactic xrbs .",
    "this is particularly true of _ chandra x - ray observatory _ because of its superior resolution .",
    "longer term , non - orbital periodicities have been observed in both lmxbs and hmxbs , are termed _ superorbital _ , and range from tens to hundreds of days @xcite .",
    "the study of these modulations are a probe of the physical processes occurring within both the donor star and the accretion disc , and also a probe of the interaction of the intense x - ray luminosity with the accretion flow .",
    "these superorbital modulations display different properties depending on the type of interacting binary in which they are found @xcite .",
    "highly relevant here are systems which display long - term superorbital modulations due to the coupled precession of their accretion discs and relativistic jets , such as the 35-d modulation of @xcite and the 162-d modulation of ss433 @xcite ; this mechanism may be responsible for the 115-d modulation seen in the ulx @xcite . only with a properly designed long - term monitoring program",
    "can we distinguish between the competing physical explanations of these superorbital periods .    to date",
    ", there have been extensive investigations of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) in m87 @xcite .",
    "some studies contain observations separated by @xmath5 years , but without regularly repeated visits ( typical of monitoring campaigns ) extended over a baseline of many years .",
    "these have primarily focused on the pointing - to - pointing variability of the spectra and fluxes of lmxbs , and their association with globular cluster systems within m87 . other important work on these xrbs includes the nature of the apparently years - long transient outbursts discovered in these sources @xcite .",
    "better samplings have been obtained for lmxbs in globular clusters near the central region of m31 @xcite .",
    "monitoring of xrbs in the milky way has led to numerous major discoveries .",
    "for example , the discovery within our own galaxy of relativistic jets and their superluminal motion in an accreting compact binary @xcite provided a link to the physics of distant quasars that are thought to behave in a similar ( yet much more powerful ) manner .",
    "the discovery of warping and precessing of the accretion discs was revealed through monitoring the long - term periodic variations in systems like ss433 , , and @xcite . and , the discovery of sub - millisecond quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in @xcite demonstrated a probe of the dynamics of the inner accretion flow in a xrb . as was shown in @xcite , only with regular , sustained monitoring",
    "is it possible to measure longer - term ( quasi- ) periodicities that range from weeks to hundreds of days , with greater precision for the longer variations such as that achieved for ss433 coming only after years ( up to decades ) of follow - up observations @xcite .",
    "_ chandra _ has now studied m87 many times over @xmath5 10 years ; this has the potential for showing long - term modulations or transient behaviour in several xrbs in m87 ( ngc 4486 , @xmath6  mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have selected a handful of the brightest sources in this galaxy and searched archival data to study their very long - term variability .",
    "the ciao data reduction threads were used to process the data , generating level-2 events lists for each observation .",
    "we used version 4.4.1 of ciao and version 4.5.1 of caldb to reprocess the data .",
    "all the data presented here were recorded with _",
    "chandra s _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) s3 chip .",
    "the data span the period 2000 july 29 to 2010 may 14 . with a handful of exceptions ,",
    "the 85 independent observations included in this analysis were typically 5 ks in duration .",
    "chandra detects photons at a rate of about @xmath3 c s@xmath1 for a source of about @xmath7 erg cm @xmath8 s@xmath1 or only about 15 counts from a borderline ulx ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) in these 5 ks observations .",
    "also , many of the observations were performed in subarray mode ( mostly due to the brightness of the core and jet of m87 ) and with varying roll angles .",
    "this led to somewhat sporadic coverage for a few sources .    to test for the presence of periods of high background or strong flares",
    ", we excluded the regions of the chip containing the core and jet of m87 , as well as regions containing point sources detected by the ciao tool ` wavdetect ` , then examined the lightcurve of the remaining events of the observation ( binning of 200s ) using the tool ` lc_sigma_clip ` , rejecting any events that are beyond 5@xmath9 from the mean count rates .",
    "no significant flares or periods of high background are detected .",
    "this means that the total exposure accumulated during the good time intervals ( gtis ) as recomputed by ` lc_sigma_clip ` are nearly identical to the value of the keyword ` exposure ` in each observation s fits file , and this time was used to compute the mean count rate .",
    "eight sources were visually selected for analysis based on their apparent relative brightness in the x - ray images , their higher sampling given the roll angles of the observations , and their being distinct from either the nucleus of the galaxy or the jet ( including knots or other clumps of diffuse emission ) .",
    "all of these sources appear in the catalogue of sources analysed in @xcite .",
    "the x - ray sources are listed in table [ summary ] , and are hereafter individually referred to by the labels indicated therein ( x1 , x2 , et cetera ) .",
    "source regions were defined as 1.5-arcsec circles centred on the identified point sources .",
    "the background regions were defined for the sources as annuli centred on the sources with inner and outer radii of 1.5 and 2.5 arcsec , respectively , to account for the diffuse emission that surrounds some of the sources while minimizing the effects of overlapping source and background regions . a spatial extraction of the total number of counts in the source and background regions , in the 0.58.0 kev range ,",
    "was performed using the ciao tool ` dmextract ` , with the error in the counts estimated using gehrels method @xcite .",

    "each point on the lightcurves represents the mean count rate ( in c s@xmath1 ) of an individual observation .",
    "data points on the lightcurves that are consistent with zero counts per second to within twice their 1@xmath9 poisson errors are denoted by arrow markers on all lightcurves , and we treat these data as upper limits .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ lightcurves ] , which is the long - term lightcurve for the source x7 .",
    "the largest distance of any of these sources from the focal point ( i.e. the narrowest point - spread function , or psf ) of the acis s3 chip is @xmath10 arcmin .",
    "we estimate the 90 per cent encircled energy radius of a 1.5-kev event to be 1.0 arcsec on - axis and 2.0 arcsec at 3 arcmin off - axis , and that for a 6.4-kev event to be 2.0 arcsec on - axis and 2.6 arcsec at 3 arcmin off - axis .",
    "we checked the most off - axis sources for any differences in period detection arising from the factor of 2 increase in the radii of the extraction apertures and background annuli , finding none . in the event that a particular source was not on the active subarray",
    ", there was no data point recorded for such a source .",
    "we confirmed each off - subarray instance visually with after inspecting all extractions returning exactly zero counts for both source and background regions .",

    "the sum of the flux within each source and background region was computed using the ciao tools ` eff2evt ` and ` dmstat ` .",
    "the source regions are defined exactly as in the lightcurve extraction step and background fluxes were estimated for a region of the same radius near the source using .",
    "the events were filtered on the 0.58 kev band .",

    "having invoked the gehrels error estimation method in the counts extraction step , the poisson errors in the case of low counts are properly taken into account . to be conservative , the larger of the asymmetric poisson errors is used .",

    "figure [ lsp ] is the lsp of the data in figure [ lightcurves ] . in order to identify spurious period detections due to sampling ,",
    "each power spectrum was compared to its corresponding window function power spectrum .",
    "figure [ windown96 ] is the window function of the data in figure [ lightcurves ] corresponding to the power spectrum in figure [ lsp ] .    to determine the white noise levels , monte carlo simulations of 10,000 randomly generated data sets for each source",
    "were made using the time values , and the mean and standard deviation of the count rate values .",
    "lsps were computed for the random data sets , and the resulting maxima in the power spectra are used to construct a cumulative probability distribution function , which describes the false - alarm probability ( fap ) associated with each value of the power .",
    "hence , a 3@xmath9 confidence level is the power associated with fap of 0.27 per cent . for our lightcurves , the power typically associated with fap of 0.27 per cent is @xmath17 610 . for the source x6 ,",

    "the recoverability chart for the data plotted in figure [ lightcurves ] is shown in figure [ recover ] .",
    "we conducted period recoverability analysis for amplitudes ranging from 25200 per cent for the source x7 .",
    "generally , the recoverability charts show the expected result that the sampling of the available data is adequate for recovery of longer - term periods for higher amplitude modulations and for higher count rates .",
    "interestingly , the charts also show that for amplitudes of @xmath5 20 per cent , which is similar to that found in ss433 , long - term periods would have low recoverability with the current sampling , and hence we would not have expected to see them had they been present .",
    "however , a more extreme amplitude variation of @xmath18 50 per cent could have enabled recovery of a wide range of periods in the existing data for the source x7 had they been present .",
    "none of the sources show strong evidence for periodic variations , although the source x7 does show marginally significant periodic variability . the remaining sources may show variability of a more general nature ( see table [ summary ] ) .",
    "henceforth , we will use the case of x7 ( see figure [ lightcurves ] ) as an exemplar in our discussion , although the analysis discussed in section [ analysis ] was applied to all sources .

    "s data are fitted to a constant ( the median count rate ) , and the resulting @xmath16 statistic is tabulated , along with the degrees of freedom @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the null hypothesis probability .",
    "the nature of ulxs in nearby galaxies continues as a subject of intense speculation and debate .",
    "once considered to be the long - sought intermediate - mass bhs , current models invoke slightly heavier than stellar - mass bhs ( 2050m@xmath23 ) to account for their observed spectra and luminosities @xcite .",
    "their controversial status has been maintained with contemporary mass estimates for the ulx ranging from 20 to 5000m@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "its 115-d modulation is either orbital , or superorbital and related to a precessing jet , as in the hyperaccreting ss433 .",
    "if the latter is the case then ulxs might be expected to display superorbital variations in the 50200 day range , and these should be visible in x - ray lightcurves .",
    "such variations require multi - year long term systematic studies and could only be carried out by _ chandra _ due to its superior spatial resolution and its more flexible scheduling capabilities compared with other x - ray telescopes . rather than having random sampling of the xrbs ,",
    "if we design a sampling plan such as is proposed here ( section [ propsim ] ) then we are able to recover these long - term periods .      to demonstrate the potential of a long - term x - ray campaign , we have used the observed x - ray modulations of ngc 5408 x-1 and ss  433 ( described above as indicative of the periodicities we wish to search for ) as input to simulate the outcomes of such a campaign .",
    "the range that we wish to be sensitive to ( 40200 days ) infers a data sampling rate of 12 observations per year ( i.e. one every 34 weeks ) , which is then repeated over the subsequent two years .",
    "we found that the observations within each year s observing window can be pseudo - random , in that they should not be closer together than 14 days .    to test the viability of such a program ,",
    "we have simulated the expected lightcurves for ulxs having a mean count rate of 0.03 counts per second .",
    "a time series is generated with an aperiodic , white noise component with root mean square variability @xmath24 to which we add a coherent sinusoidal signal with amplitude @xmath25 and period @xmath26 .",
    "the average of the series is taken to be the actual detected count rate of the ulx being simulated .",
    "the time series is binned over the typical observation duration of @xmath27 s and a poisson realisation is undertaken to obtain a simulated light - curve of counts per time bin .",
    "the simulated light - curve is then sampled on the 36 observations spread over the 3 years , and these data points are input to periodogram analysis , in order to see whether the input periodicity @xmath26 can be recovered .",
    "we have constructed simulations with periodic modulations of 50 , 100 and 150 days , with amplitudes of 20 per cent ( typical of , , and ss433 ) , and for a variety of samplings .",
    "all recover the input periodicity , but with varying degrees of significance .",
    "best results are obtained with 12 observations per year ( spacings of 24 weeks ) , for all the periodicities , and a typical example , including both the lightcurve and the power spectrum , is shown in figure [ ulxsim ] .",

    "* ) is not recovered .",
    "all previous attempts to study long - term variability with _ chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton _ have been based on relatively few archival observations randomly distributed in time .",
    "they serve only to indicate why such a study needs to be undertaken in a well - defined , systematic manner over at least a 3-year baseline , as simulated here .",

    ", we found no statistically significant periods .",
    "we also found no visible evidence of transient outburst events .",
    "however , using period recoverability analysis we found that for amplitude modulations of @xmath5 20 per cent ( similar to what is observed for ss433 , ngc5408 , and m82 ) , period recovery with the current data is very low for a wide range of periods",
