    "the complexity of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , with several parameters controlling their properties , hinders progress in uncovering their superconducting mechanism .",
    "it is extremely difficult to isolate and control only one parameter at a time . to overcome the experimental challenge in the study of htsc , we prepare and investigate single crystalline samples of the ( ca@xmath0la@xmath1)(ba@xmath2la@xmath3)cu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( clblco ) system , with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this system is isostructural to yba@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( ybco ) and supplies us with two tuning parameters : the amount of oxygen @xmath7 and the ratio of calcium to barium set by @xmath6 .",
    "each @xmath6 defines a superconducting family .",
    "calcium and barium have the same valence , and their total amount in the chemical formula is constant .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 does not serve as a formal dopant . however , @xmath6 tunes the cu - o - cu bond distances and buckling angles , leading to variations in the overlap of orbitals .",
    "@xcite this property of clblco opens a window to investigate the relation between @xmath16 and the physical parameters that are determined by orbital overlap .",
    "[ figure1 ] = 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 .",
    "@xmath17 , @xmath18 ( open symbols ) and @xmath16 are plotted as a function of oxygen composition @xmath7 .",
    "the long arrows point to the @xmath7 values where @xmath17 starts to drop , which defines @xmath19 .",
    "the samples @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are marked by their @xmath25 values .",

    "they summarize muon spin rotation ( @xmath29sr )  @xcite and transport  @xcite experiments performed on powder samples .",
    "it can be seen that the transition temperatures to the antiferromagnetic , spin - glass , and superconducting phases ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 , respectively ) are strongly @xmath6 dependent . in particular , the superconducting transition temperature of the optimally doped samples @xmath9 increases by more than 30% from the @xmath10 family to the @xmath30 family . however , high - resolution powder x - ray diffraction  @xcite and nmr experiments  @xcite indicate that @xmath10 samples are more ordered than @xmath30 ones .",
    "therefore , disorder can not be responsible for the reduction of @xmath9 as @xmath6 decreases ; there has to be a more fundamental reason for these variations of @xmath9 .",
    "figure 1(b ) depicts a re - scaled phase diagram for clblco .",
    "we obtain this unified diagram by replacing @xmath17 with the superexchange strength @xmath8 , normalizing the temperature scales by @xmath9 ,  @xcite and transforming the oxygen composition parameter @xmath7 according to @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite the scaling parameter @xmath32 translates to the doping efficiency with which holes are introduced in the cuo@xmath33 planes and was determined via measurements of the @xmath34o nuclear quadrupole resonance parameter @xmath35 .",

    "the unified phase diagram suggests a similar origin for the magnetic and superconducting phase transitions .",
    "the superexchange @xmath8 is determined by orbital overlap and is closely related to the hopping rate @xmath37 . while @xmath8 is well - defined for only the parent compounds , hopping exists even in the doped system . a close relation between @xmath16 and @xmath8",
    "would therefore imply that superconductivity in this family of cuprates is dominantly driven by kinetic energy .",
    "@xcite    however , the values for @xmath8 were determined by @xmath29sr .",
    "this method requires measurements over a wide range of temperatures in which @xmath8 could change due to lattice expansion .",
    "furthermore , the theory that extracts @xmath8 from the data is rather involved and can only fit the data to a certain extent .",
    "@xcite the work presented here overcomes these challenges by using two - magnon raman scattering experiments .",
    "this technique determines @xmath8 directly by measuring the shift in photon energy @xmath38 between incoming and outgoing light due to a spin - flip process of two adjacent spins .",
    "our measurements of the raman shift as a function of both @xmath6 and @xmath7 reveal a strong correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 in clblco .",
    "several single crystals of ( ca@xmath0la@xmath1)(ba@xmath2la@xmath3)cu@xmath4o@xmath5 with varying @xmath7 for both the @xmath10 and @xmath30 families , as well as one single crystal of the @xmath39 family , were successfully grown in a floating zone furnace .",

    "@xcite    for the raman measurements the crystals were cleaved to obtain a shiny , flat , virgin surface .",
    "the cleaving produces facets which are perpendicular to the @xmath40 axis .",
    "therefore , the light scatters with its polarization within the @xmath41 plane for all measurements . polarized raman spectra were obtained using a jobin - yvon micro - raman spectrometer ( labram hr ) in backscattering geometry with a @xmath42 nm solid - state nd : yag laser , a 50@xmath43 magnification objective , and a diffraction grating with 1800 grooves / mm .",
    "the detection was done with a nitrogen - cooled ccd ( horiba spectrum one ) . to prevent damage to the sample from overheating the laser power at the sample",

    "the clblco system crystallizes in a simple tetragonal structure ( space group @xmath44 ) .",
    "five raman - active phonon modes are expected from backscattering within the @xmath41 plane .",
    "four of these phonon modes are of @xmath45 symmetry , where the scattered light has the same polarization as the incident light .",
    "@xcite one phonon mode has a @xmath46 symmetry , where the polarization of the scattered light @xmath47 is perpendicular to the incident light polarization @xmath48 and the phonon intensity reaches a maximum when both @xmath48 and @xmath47 are at @xmath49 from the @xmath50 and @xmath51 axes .",

    "the respective line - width is a measure of the crystal quality and the electron - phonon coupling strength .",

    "1(a ) in the following .",
    "since the oxygenation of crystals is slow and raman scattering is surface sensitive , it is also important to check the antiferromagnetic part of the phase diagram .",
