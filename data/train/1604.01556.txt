    "in the standard theory of particle collisions , both classical and quantum , one assumes the existence of asymptotic states in which the particles can be regarded as non - interacting . for this picture to be valid , the interaction force between the colliding objects has to fall down sufficiently fast with the distance .",
    "meanwhile , in various physical systems , like quarks joined by the gluon strings , this is not so , and the question arises , whether one can sensibly define the notion of the potential energy within the classical relativistic two - body problem . with this motivation , we consider the scattering problem for a point particle impinging onto the brane imbedded into space - time with the codimension one , in which case the interaction force does not fall down asymptotically",
    ". we will be interested in the two - body problem , accounting for the brane back - reaction on equal footing with the particle .",
    "this problem may have physical applications in cosmology @xcite , in particular , perforation of the domain walls by black holes was suggested as a novel mechanism of domain walls destruction in the early universe @xcite .",
    "it may be of interest also in the study of the black hole escape from the randall - sundrum brane , in the dynamical description of colliding branes in supergravity / string theory and so on .",
    "recently we have shown @xcite that the perforation of the domain wall by a point particle can be described within linearized gravity in terms of distributions . here",
    "we concentrate on the the energy - momentum balance @xcite in this process , extending the treatment to the second order in gravitational constant .",
    "this allows to introduce the effective gravitational stress - tensor which has to be taken into account in the energy - momentum balance .",
    "this tensor generically is non - local , but we show that it can be still unambiguously divided between the two objects leading to the notion of gravitationally dressed momenta whose balance involves an extra momentum flux through the lateral surface of the world tube .",
    "our system consists of a point particle moving along the world - line @xmath0 and an infinitely thin domain wall filling the world - volume @xmath1 given by the embedding equations in @xmath2 dimensional space - time ( ) with the metric @xmath3 , @xmath4 of the signature @xmath5 .",

    ". the retarded solution of this equation consists of two parts @xmath42 , where the first is antisymmetric in time and represents an eventual deformation of the wall correlated with the particle motion .",
    "the second part is the spherical branon wave starting at the moment of perforation @xmath43 and propagating to infinity with the velocity of light @xcite : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a bessel function of the first kind .",
    "in the first order in @xmath11 the total energy - momentum tensor consists of three contributions ( [ psi2eq ] ) and satisfies the conservation equation @xmath46 . to convert the latter into the energy - momentum balance equation one has to integrate over the world - tube @xmath47 : @xmath48 bounded by the closed hypersurface , consisting of two space - like hypersurfaces associated with the moments of time @xmath49 ( usually chosen orthogonal to the time - axis ) , and the closing lateral hypersurface @xmath50 at spatial infinity .",
    "since the wall is infinite its total energy - momentum diverges both in zero and the first order in @xmath11 , so some subtraction is required .",

    "one is able to introduce , instead of the potential energy , the dressed quantities for the particle in the gravitational field of the domain wall , and respectively , of the domain wall in the gravitational field of the particle such that their sum is conserved .",

    "the balance equation contains the lateral flux : @xmath73 note that , since @xmath74 and @xmath75 are linearly independent , this extra contribution holds separately for @xmath76 and @xmath77 branon components .",
    "we have shown that non - local gravitational stresses effectively localize within perturbative treatment of gravity enabling us to establish the local energy - momentum conservation for the scattering problem without asymptotical free states .",
    "the unusual feature of the balance equation is the existence of non - zero flux of @xmath78component of the momentum density through the lateral surface of the world - tube due to the branon . strictly speaking , in this case",
    "the conserved momentum can not be defined as an integral over the space only .",
    "but if one still keeps such a definition , the imbalance will be exactly accounted for by the lateral flux playing the role of an external force .",
