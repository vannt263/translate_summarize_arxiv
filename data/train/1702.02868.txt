    "volatile elements , such as nitrogen , carbon , and oxygen are crucial for the chemistry of life .",
    "the prevalence of water is of particular importance .",
    "the distributions of water and other volatiles in our solar system were controlled primarily by temperatures in the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "interior of the snow line in the disk , water remained in the gas phase , and rocks were , consequently , relatively dry . beyond the snow line ,",
    "water was stable as ice , vestiges of which persist to this day in some asteroids , icy moons , comets , and kuiper - belt - objects ( kbos ) . even further out , nitrogen ice condensed into rocks and could be present in comets from the kuiper belt and oort cloud .",
    "it is commonly argued that terrestrial planets , having formed inside of the snow line , may have accreted from dry refractory materials , and that water and other volatile compounds were delivered later by the impact of planetesimals from the asteroid belt and/or kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "the presence of kbos around other stars has been inferred by excess @xmath0 50 k blackbody radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . however , the concentrations of water and other volatiles within such extrasolar minor bodies are largely unknown",
    ".    the sizes and masses of some individual extrasolar planets can be measured when combining radial velocity and transit observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the bulk density of an extrasolar planet can be inferred , but it is difficult to find a unique solution for the planet s internal composition @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that many white dwarfs are actively accreting rocky debris that  pollutes \" their atmospheres @xcite .",
    "typically , a white dwarf s atmosphere is dominated by either hydrogen or helium because heavier elements sink due to the high surface gravity . heavy elements , if detected , must therefore come from an external source , and in many cases that source is an accretion of tidally disrupted rocky objects @xcite . as a result , high - resolution spectroscopic observations of polluted white dwarfs provide a unique way to measure the bulk compositions of extrasolar planetary objects @xcite .",
    "there are at least a dozen polluted white dwarfs with detailed measurements of accreted material @xcite .",
    "their abundance patterns are similar to those of rocky objects in our solar system , including bulk earth and chondrite meteorites from the asteroid belt ",
    "o , fe , si , and mg are the four dominant elements in familiar proportions .",
    "volatile elements are almost always depleted , just as they are in earth and meteorites from the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "excess oxygen relative to which can be bound to rock - forming elements like mg , si , fe , and ca has only been detected in three white dwarfs .",
    "the excess oxygen is attributable to accretion of h@xmath2o rich objects @xcite .",
    "the rarity of water among the objects sampled by polluted white dwarfs to date is likely to be an indicator of low primordial water content because water and volatiles are generally expected to survive the post main sequence evolution of the host star @xcite . in general , the overall compositions of extrasolar rocky material identified thus far closely resemble those of dry , relatively volatile - poor asteroids in our solar system .    here , we report results of high - resolution spectroscopic observations of the polluted white dwarf wd 1425 + 540 with the _ keck telescope _ and the _ hubble space telescope_. wd 1425 + 540 ( g200 - 39 , 14:27:36.0 , + 53:48:28.4 j2000 ) was first reported in greenstein s degenerate star catalog @xcite .",
    "it has a k dwarf companion g200 - 40 located 40.0 arcsec away at 14:27:37.1 , + 53:47:49.2 j2000 @xcite .",
    "wd 1425 + 540 has a helium - dominated atmosphere but also contains a large amount of hydrogen ; it is the prototype of the  dba \" class of white dwarfs that display both helium and hydrogen lines @xcite .",
    "wd 1425 + 540 was observed with the blue collimator of the hires @xcite on the _ keck telescope _ on 2008 february 13 and 2014 may 22 ( ut ) .",
    "the weather was clear on both nights .",
    "the c5 decker was used , and the resolution was @xmath0 40,000 .",
    "the total exposure time was 5960 s. data were reduced using standard iraf routines developed for reducing echelle data following @xcite .",
    "the final combined spectrum has an almost continuous coverage from 3115 to 5960  .",
    "wd 1425 + 540 was observed with the cos onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ under program i d 13453 ( pi : m. jura ) on 2014 december 8 ( ut ) .",
    "we used the g130 m grating with a central wavelength of 1291  , which gives a wavelength coverage of 1130 - 1431  with a small gap in the middle .",
    "the spectral resolution was @xmath0 20,000 .",
    "we had five consecutive orbits on this star and the total exposure time was 8358 s. the data were processed with the pipeline calcos 2.18.5 . following @xcite , around the o",
    "i triplet 1304  region , we used the timefilter to extract the night - time portion of the data to minimize the effect of geocoronal emissions .",
    "wd 1425 + 540 has a trigonometric parallax and the derived distance is 58 @xmath3 13 pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite fitted the optical spectra and found the effective temperature t@xmath4 = 14,490 k , surface gravity log g = 7.95 , and the hydrogen to helium ratio log n(h)/n(he ) = -4.2 .",
    "they also derived a spectroscopic distance of 56 pc , in good agreement with the parallax .",
    "however , this model can not reproduce the strong asymmetric ly @xmath5 in the _ cos _ data @xcite .",
    "ly @xmath5 can be contaminated with interstellar absorption , which makes it stronger than expected from the optical hydrogen abundance .",
    "an interstellar hydrogen column density @xmath0 10@xmath1 @xmath6 is required to fit the red wing of ly @xmath5 .",
    "however , the schlegel map shows that the extinction e(b - v ) is 0.02 along the line of sight of wd 1425 + 540 @xcite .",
    "that corresponds to an upper limit of the hydrogen column density of 10@xmath7 @xmath6 , which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of h required to fit ly @xmath5 .",
    "thus , interstellar absorption along the line of sight can not explain the order of magnitude discrepancy between the model - derived optical and ultraviolet hydrogen abundances .    in order to search for a solution that fits all of the observed parameters , we computed a grid of models that cover t@xmath4 between 13,000 k and 16,500 k , log g between 7.5 and 9.0 , and log n(h)/n(he ) between -3.0 and -5.0 .",
    "we compared the models with the observed sed , he lines , balmer lines , and ly @xmath5 .",
    "however , we were unable to find a solution that fits all of the observables ; the discrepancy between balmer lines and ly @xmath5 is always present .",
    "wd 1425 + 540 represents an extreme case , but discrepancies between optical and ultraviolet hydrogen abundances have been observed in other helium - dominated white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite investigated this issue and found it is possibly due to atmospheric stratification . finding the best white dwarf parameters that fit all available data is beyond the scope of this paper , and we defer it to a future study .",
    "fortunately , the relative element abundances are not sensitive to white dwarf parameters for white dwarfs like wd 1425 + 540 ; they are comparable within the measurement uncertainties @xcite .",
    "we adopted the temperature and surface gravity as listed in @xcite . to assess the effect of hydrogen abundance on the heavy elements",
    ", we calculated synthetic white dwarf model spectra for two sets of hydrogen abundances : model i adopts log n(h)/n(he ) = -4.2 , as derived from balmer lines , while model ii uses log n(h)/n(he ) = -3.0 from ly @xmath5 , which is different from our value of -3.0 .",
    "it is likely due to the presence of heavy elements , which changes the temperature and pressure profile of the atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "] . to derive the abundances of heavy elements",
    ", we followed the method outlined in @xcite and divided the spectra into 10 - 20  segments .",
    "each element typically has 2 - 4 segments and each segment was fitted separately , as shown in figure [ fig : wd1425 ] .",
    "the flux level of the model in each segment was another free parameter ; this was particularly important for the lines in the wings of ly @xmath5 ( e.g. , figure [ fig : wd1425 ] , panels ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) , and ( g ) ) , because we were not able to reproduce the asymmetric profile of ly @xmath5 .",
    "we used a chi - squared minimization routine to iterate our calculation of the model atmosphere until the difference between the observed spectra and the model has reached the minimum .",
    "the uncertainty was calculated by taking the standard deviation of the abundances derived from each segment .",
    "some representative spectra are shown in figure [ fig : wd1425 ] .",
    "both the _ cos _ data and the model spectra are available in the supplementary material .    at 58",
    "pc , there can still be a small amount of interstellar absorption present in the ultraviolet spectra of wd 1425 + 540 .",
    "the average radial velocity of the stellar spectral lines is 3.0 @xmath3 4.8 km s@xmath8 , very close to the velocity of typical interstellar lines . in order to assess the potential influence of interstellar lines , we only fit lines that are most likely to have an interstellar contribution based on previous studies @xcite ; these include si ii 1260.4  , c ii 1334.5  , o i 1302.2  , and the n i triplet around 1200  .",
    "we found the derived abundances based on these lines to be comparable to those from the other photospheric lines . we conclude that interstellar lines do not contribute significantly to the spectra , and we used all available lines , as also seen in previous studies @xcite , to derive the final abundances reported in table [ tab : abundances ] .",
    "specifically , the abundance of n is derived from n i 1243.2  ( panel ( f ) in figure [ fig : wd1425 ] ) , the n i triplet around 1200  ( panel ( e ) in figure [ fig : wd1425 ] ) , and the n i triplet around 1145  .",

    "* ) . however , the increase of hydrogen abundance could also come from some unexplored evolutionary sequence , such as convective mixing of a thin hydrogen - rich atmosphere below the helium convection zone @xcite .",
    "the accreting material observed in wd 1425 + 540 provides direct evidence for the presence of kbo analogs around stars other than the sun . in addition , wd 1425 + 540 has a k dwarf companion at 40.0 arcsec ( 2240 au ) away @xcite .",
    "the presence of a distant stellar companion can impact the stability of extended planetary systems and , thus , enhance the chances of perturbing objects  that initially orbit far from a white dwarf  into its tidal radius via the kozai - lidov mechanism @xcite .",
    "when on the main sequence , wd 1425 + 540 would have had a mass of about 2 m@xmath16 and a luminosity of 10 l@xmath17 . thus , the semimajor axes of cold nitrogen - bearing kbos would have been about 120 au  that is about 3 times further from the star than is the sun s kbo .",
    "then , mass loss on the agb would have moved the star s kuiper belt out another factor of about 3 .",
    "therefore , the object that has been accreted by wd 1425 + 540 likely was orbiting the white dwarf out beyond 300 au before it began its fateful journey toward oblivion .",
    "previous studies show that white dwarfs are mostly accreting from dry , volatile - depleted minor planets .",
    "the discovery of a kuiper - belt - object analog , which has polluted the atmosphere of wd 1450 + 540 , provides strong evidence that volatile - rich planetesimals also exist around other stars . in the solar system ,",
