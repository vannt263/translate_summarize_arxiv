    "when confronted with the mysteries of the quantum world , one often calls for classical analogues . quantum information is no exception . for example , it has been asked whether quantum computation is a quantum analogue to classical digital or to classical analog computation . in this regard ,",
    "it was pointed out that classical analog computation can not be stabilized against error while quantum computation can @xcite .",
    "it is therefore hard to perceive the two as mutual analogues .    here",
    "we explore the remaining possibility , namely that quantum computation is digital .",
    "we pursue this position not as an end , but rather as a means to inquire about the foundations of quantum computation , and to aim at a different approach to quantum algorithms .",
    "the established concepts of quantum interference , phase estimation @xcite and amplitude amplification @xcite provide a framework within which the most powerful known quantum algorithms , such as shor s factoring algorithm @xcite and grover s search algorithm @xcite , are conveniently explained .",
    "these concepts therefore shape our thinking about quantum algorithms and the origin of the quantum speed - up . in the search for novel quantum algorithms and their construction principles",
    ", we may therefore begin with an alternative concept of the above general kind .",
    "our pick is the digital character of quantum computation , or _",
    "discreteness_. we take the position that both classical and quantum computation are built on discrete data structures ; and this is the respect in which they are mutual analogues . is such a position justifiable ? what can be deduced from this starting point ?",
    "the elementary unit of information in classical computation is the ` bit ' .",
    "its quantum counterpart is usually taken to be the qubit  the merger of the classical bit with the superposition principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "but the qubit is _ not _ discrete : in any neighborhood , however small , of a valid one - qubit quantum state there is another such state .    to begin",
    ", we therefore need to identify discrete structures in hilbert space that underlie algorithmic procedures .",
    "such structures exist , and we provide examples for them in this paper .",
    "to summarize , our program is as follows : ( 1 ) identify discrete structures in finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , and relate them to quantum mechanical computation , ( 2 ) show that quantum mechanics is indeed harnessed in these computations , ( 3 ) identify key features required for a speed - up to emerge and construct families of algorithms that possess these features . repeat until an example algorithm with a significant quantum speed - up",
    "( 4 ) develop a theory for discrete quantum computations .",
    "in the present paper , we complete steps 1 and 2 of the above program .",
    "we derive examples for discrete quantum algorithms from quantum codes with non - clifford transversal gates .",
    "that is , we sever quantum codes from their originally intended use of correcting errors , and instead let them compute .",
    "a further discrete quantum algorithm is derived from a counterexample @xcite to the recently refuted lu - lc conjecture @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a suitable setting for our discussion is deterministic quantum computation @xcite , where the computational result is obtained with unit probability .",
    "thus , voluntarily and emphatically we restrict to quantum phenomena in which the general probabilistic character of quantum - mechanical predictions does not come into play .",
    "thereby , arguably , one of the most prominent features of quantum mechanics is left out of the picture .",
    "we therefore need to ask : what is quantum mechanical about deterministic quantum algorithms ?",
    "we address this question in section  [ ksgen ] .",
    "we prove that no deterministic quantum computation which computes a non - linear function can , in its measurement - based version , be described by a non - contextual hidden - variable model .",
    "in other words , every such computation implies a proof of the kochen - specker theorem @xcite .",
    "also note that efficient quantum algorithms remain in our class .",
    "specifically , a deterministic version of the quantum algorithm solving _ discrete log _ exists @xcite .",
    "it is closely related to shor s factoring algorithm @xcite , and breaks the diffie - hellmann public key exchange .",
    "we point out that the simple deterministic quantum computations discussed as examples in this paper do not yet lead to significant quantum speed - ups .",
    "we discuss them nonetheless , in order to demonstrate first of all that there are discrete structures in hilbert space that give rise to computations .",
    "the functions computed in these examples are non - linear .",
    "the ` linear vs.@xmath0 non - linear ' separation is important and natural for the one - way quantum computer @xcite .",
    "also , it is the separation between measurement - based quantum computations which can and which can not be described by a non - contextual hidden variable model .",
    "a setting conducive to our study is deterministic quantum computation @xcite .",
    "specifically , we restrict to operation on finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , and require    for deterministic quantum computations ,    [ d ] @xmath1{9cm}{input and output are classical   bit strings;\\vspace{1.5mm}}\\\\    \\label{d2 }    \\parbox[t]{9cm}{the computation succeeds with certainty . }",

    "we consider deterministic quantum computation in both the circuit and the measurement - based model .",
    "the former requires less preparation , but in the latter the connection with contextuality of quantum mechanics is easier to make .",
    "we consider a quantum register of two sets @xmath2 and @xmath3 of qubits , with @xmath4 the computational basis of @xmath5 , and a unitary circuit @xmath6 such that @xmath7 we regard @xmath8 as the input and @xmath9 as the output of the computation , and are interested in the function @xmath10 .",
    "we now translate the circuits ( [ gencirc ] ) into their measurement - based versions , for which the connection with contextuality of quantum mechanics will be easier to make . specifically , we consider the one - way quantum computer @xcite in which quantum computation is driven by local measurements on an entangled quantum resource state @xmath11 .    for all qubits @xmath12 in the support @xmath13 of @xmath11 the measured local observables take the form @xmath14=\\cos \\phi_k x_k + ( -1)^{q_k}\\sin \\phi_k y_k.\\ ] ] we call the @xmath15 , the measurement angles .",

    ". however , our present much weaker criterion seems adequate for the task of gathering initial phenomenology .",
    "there is three - fold justification for placing a separation line between linear and non - linear functions ,    1 .",
    "the separation between linear vs. non - linear functions is natural in measurement - based quantum computation with cluster states @xcite .",
    "there , the computational capability of the classical control device is restricted to addition modulo 2 .",
    "this limited device can evaluate all linear functions by itself ; for non - linear functions it requires access to a quantum resource .",

    "deterministic measurement - based algorithms which compute a non - linear function can not be described by a non - contextual hidden - variable model , and are thus non - classical .",
    "see section  [ ks ] .",
    "the separation between linear vs. non - linear functions in measurement - based quantum computation ( containing one - way quantum computation as a special case ) has recently been emphasized in @xcite .",
    "therein , a particularly simple measurement - based realization of the `` and''-gate was presented , using a ghz - state as quantum resource . if supplemented by ghz - states and the capability to measure them locally , a classical control computer restricted to additions mod 2",
    "becomes classically universal .",
    "for this ghz example , a relationship between computational power and the violation of local realistic theories was established .    in this paper",
    ", we will only consider deterministic quantum computations which , in addition to obeying criterion  [ crit1 ] , contain non - clifford operations .",
    "the reason is that such computations are not amenable to efficient classical simulation by the stabilizer formalism @xcite .",
    "_ equivalence of non - linear functions .",
    "_ in the scenario introduced above , the ability to compute non - linear boolean functions is a resource whereas computing linear functions is for free .",

    "this section introduces , through a simple example , the two main themes of this paper : identifying discrete structures in hilbert space for computation , and the relation of these structures to foundational aspects of quantum mechanics .",

    "it is easily verified that @xmath72 is an eigenstate with eigenvalue 1 of the following tensor product operators : @xmath73 note that two of these operators , namely those with all @xmath74 or all @xmath75 , carry a minus sign .",
    "now , if @xmath76 then @xmath77 , and the local measured observables are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath78 .",

    ". then , @xmath79 . in the six other cases , @xmath86 .",
    "thus , the computed function is @xmath87 with the equivalence relation ( [ fuequiv ] ) , i.e. , modulo linear functions , the function @xmath88 computed by measurement - based computation on the resource @xmath72 is equivalent to a toffoli gate @xmath89 . in ( [ fuequiv ] ) , let @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and similar expressions hold for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath93 .",
    "certainly , it does not require a quantum system to efficiently implement a classical toffoli gate .",
    "therefore , for our quantum - mechanical way of implementing it , we need to ask : _ do we really harness quantum mechanics in this computation ? _",
    "the answer is ` yes ' .",
    "our procedure is quantum , or at least non - classical , because it can not be described by a non - contextual hidden - variable model .",
    "hidden - variable models ( hvms ) were spurred by einstein , podolsky and rosen s observation @xcite that , given a set of assumptions about what should constitute ` physical reality ' , quantum mechanics could not be considered a complete description of the physical world .",
    "contrary to a quantum - mechanical description of a physical system , according to which the outcome of a measurement is brought into existence by the act of measurement , in a hidden - variable model the outcome is merely revealed by the measurement and was a property of the measured system all the time before .",
    "specifically , for each member in an ensemble of identically prepared states , values @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , .. are assigned as pre - existing measurement outcomes to observables @xmath3 , @xmath97 , @xmath6 , .. .",
    "the sets of values may differ from copy to copy in the ensemble , and are distributed in such a way as to reproduce the quantum - mechanical predictions for the measurement of a set of commuting observables .    with no additional assumptions made ,",
    "hidden - variable models can not be ruled out as descriptions of physical reality ; see @xcite for an example .",
    "this changes , however , with the seemingly most innocent additional assumptions .",
    "one such assumption is _ non - contextuality_. it asserts that , for commuting observables , the values @xmath98 only depend upon the observable they are assigned to , but not on the observables measured in conjunction ; i.e , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , etc . with this additional assumption ,",
    "hvms are ruled out by the bell - kochen - specker theorem @xcite .",
    "versions of the bell - kochen - specker ( bks ) theorem have been derived for different settings , and the original proofs have been simplified @xcite - @xcite . in the context of quantum information",
    ", the bks theorem has been related to quantum codes @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , two - party secure computation @xcite and to quantum games @xcite .",
    "also , the bks theorem has recently been tested experimentally @xcite .",
    "of particular interest to us are mermin s proofs @xcite of the bks theorem , one applying to a hilbert space of dimension @xmath101 and one to @xmath102 .",
    "the latter of the two admits the foundation of non - contextuality in locality .",
    "also , the argument becomes state - dependent , with the state in question being a three - party greenberger - horne - zeilinger state ( ghz - state ) @xcite .",
    "this state - dependence may appear as a drawback from some perspective , but for us it provides a link to computation : as has been shown by anders and browne @xcite , accessing ghz - states by local measurement renders a very limited classical control computer classically universal .",
    "since the present computational resource is a four - particle ghz - state , our discussion of contextuality will closely parallel mermin s argument @xcite for a three - particle ghz - state .",
    "we start from the assumption that a non - contextual hidden variable model describing measurement - based computation on @xmath72 exists , and derive a contradiction .",
    "we consider the nonlocal observables from the first row of eq .",
    "( [ ghzcorr ] ) and the local observables @xmath103 , @xmath104 , for @xmath105 , whose measurement drives the computation .",
    "an hvm must assign values @xmath106 to the respective observables such that its predictions are compatible with quantum mechanics . from eq .",
    "( [ ghzcorr ] ) then follows that @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "also , in order to agree with quantum - mechanics , for a set of mutually commuting operators the corresponding values @xmath98 must obey the same identities as the operators do .",
    "thus , @xmath109 implies @xmath110 , etc , such that @xmath111 no assignment to local values @xmath112 can satisfy the set of constraints ( [ ghzcon ] ) .",
    "the product @xmath113 of all @xmath98 as they appear in ( [ ghzcon ] ) can be evaluated in two ways , namely ( a ) by first multiplying within the rows and ( b ) by first multiplying within the columns . in ( a ) one",
    "obtains @xmath114 , as is evident from the right column in ( [ ghzcon ] ) . regarding ( b ) , note that every @xmath115 appears an even number of times in the table , hence @xmath116 . contradiction .",
    "thus , the statistics from measurement of observables ( [ lr ] ) on a four - particle ghz - state does not permit a non - contextual hvm description .",
    "the connection between deterministic quantum computation and contextuality of quantum mechanics is not limited to a few examples such as the one discussed in the previous section .",
    "rather , it generalizes to a large class of deterministic measurement - based quantum computations . in this regard , note the following    [ nlincon ] consider measurement - based quantum computation by local projective measurements on a multi - qubit quantum state , with at most two choices for the measurement basis at each qubit location .",
    "if such a computation deterministically computes a non - linear boolean function then it can not be described by a non - contextual hidden - variable model .    in other words ,",
    "every proper deterministic quantum computation by measurement implies a proof of the bell - kochen - specker theorem , albeit in higher dimensions than three .",
