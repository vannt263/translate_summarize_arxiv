    "it has been said that `` in the thirties , under the demoralizing influence of quantum - theoretic perturbation theory , the mathematics required of a theoretical physicist was reduced to a rudimentary knowledge of the latin and greek alphabets . '' likewise , the ability to evaluate multi - loop feynman diagram can be reduced to an ability to do some simple tensor algebra , some graphical manipulations to purge the calculations of divergences , a knowledge of some basic properties of @xmath1 functions , and the ability to evaluate integrals numerically . since this is obviously damaging to the delicate egos of theoretical physicists we advocate that the entire procedure can",
    " and should  be automated and handed over to computers which do not have egos and , as is well - known , never make mistakes .",
    "precision measurements related to properties of elementary particles are nowadays on a level which makes the inclusion of quantum corrections to theoretical pre- and post - dictions mandatory .",
    "as will be explained below these quantum corrections are evaluated in the context of quantum field theoretic perturbation theory , the loop expansion .",
    "this allows for a systematic evaluation of quantum corrections to  in principle  any order in the coupling parameters of the theory under consideration .",
    "the complexity of perturbative calculations grows with the number of free internal momenta which are integrated over ( loops ) , and the number of external particles of the process under consideration ( legs ) .",
    "only a limited number of observables have actually been calculated beyond the one - loop level . for one - loop scattering amplitudes on the other hand only one complete scattering process with more that five external legs has been evaluated up to now : the electroweak corrections to four fermion production in electron positron collisions which is highly relevant for @xmath2collider phenomenology @xcite . for hadron colliders",
    "a lot of progress has been made very recently concerning the evaluation of six - point amplitudes .",
    "different methods have been designed to tackle this problem and benchmark amplitudes for six - photon @xcite and six - gluon scattering @xcite are now available . in the one - loop case so - called unitarity based methods have played a prominent role in these developments ( see @xcite for a review and references therein ) . the unitarity approach is not based on feynman diagrams but rather on bootstrapping tree level amplitudes .",
    "although it has a big potential its applicability to amplitudes with internal and external masses needs further developments before it may replace the feynman diagrammatic approach .",
    "it should be noted that the closed - form structure of one - loop amplitudes is completely understood .",
    "one can show that each one - loop feynman integral is expressible in terms of dilogarithms . even at two loops the situation is less clear : only a limited number of four - point amplitudes , mainly for massless particles ,",
    "are known .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are reduced first to an independent set of basis functions , the so - called master integrals , by using integration by parts identities @xcite and relations from lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "the analytic knowledge of the amplitude relies then on the successful evaluation of the master integrals .",
    "this is a formidable task and typically only successful if the number of scales is very restricted .",
    "for example a breakthrough in that direction was the analytical evaluation based on mellin - barnes representations of the massless planar @xcite and non - planar @xcite four - point two loop integrals in 2000 .",
    "although there has been some progress for more complicated cases it has been very slow .",
    "unfortunately , even direct numerical evaluation is highly non - trivial as the presence of infrared ( ir ) and ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences within the graphs necessitates regularization ; even in their absence integrable singularities due to internal thresholds requires new numerical methods @xcite .      beyond the two loop level essentially",
    "only one - scale problems have been evaluated so far .",
    "a very remarkable result here is the recent analytical evaluation of the three - loop splitting functions in qcd @xcite . by mapping the splitting functions to mellin moment integrals",
    "one can generate a hierarchy of difference equations which have to be solved recursively .",
    "the project took many person - years and needed to accumulate a database of integrals which occupied about 3.5 gbytes of disk space .",
    "the algebraic manipulations relied on the domain - specific language form , or more precisely on constant improvements of this code . indeed , the successful completion of this important calculation relied on the fact that the author of the algebraic manipulation code was a member of the collaboration .",
    "the form code was also the basis of the few known four - loop computations in perturbative qcd .",
    "all renormalization constants are known at this level @xcite .",
    "an important milestone was in this respect the evaluation of the four - loop @xmath3-function in qcd @xcite in the so - called @xmath4 renormalization scheme .",
    "the problem was mapped to the evaluation of three loop propagator functions which were computed with the form package mincer .",
    "the project amounted to the evaluation of about 50,000 feynman diagrams and its confirmation by an independent group was an important issue @xcite .",
    "the latter mapped the problem to the evaluation of the divergent part of some four - loop tadpole master integrals which were evaluated by solving integration by parts identities using a dedicated c++ code . to give a prominent example of a five - loop contribution to a",
    "very precisely measured observable we should mention the numerical evaluation of the anomalous magnetic moment of leptons by kinoshita  et .",
    "some dominant contributions are known numerically now even at the five - loop level @xcite .",
    "the parameter integrals corresponding to the feynman diagrams are evaluated with the monte carlo integration routine vegas .",
    "this heroic effort will presumably not be matched by an analytic computation in the foreseeable future .",
    "remarkably enough the three loop fully analytic result is available @xcite .",
    "when quantum field theories ( qfts ) were developed in the 1930s they were expressed in terms of field operators acting on hilbert spaces and satisfying various commutation and anticommutation relations .",
    "nowadays we prefer to think of them in terms of functional ( or path ) integrals , which give us greater geometrical insight ( for example for the introduction of fadeev - popov ghosts for gauge - fixing non - abelian gauge theories ) with just as high a level of mathematical rigour ( namely not very much ) .",
    "the quantities we want to calculate are matrix elements of the scattering ( @xmath5 ) matrix , and these can be written as integrals over all possible field configurations with a measure @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the action which is the space - time integral of the lagrangian density @xmath8 defining the theory .",
    "we take the dimension of space - time to be @xmath9 rather than four as this is a convenient way of `` regulating '' the divergences that occur ; when we have removed all the divergences by some `` renormalization '' procedure that we shall discuss later then we will take the limit that @xmath10 ( or @xmath11 which is convenient for the scalar @xmath12 theory we are using as an example ) . for a scalar field theory , which for simplicity is all we shall consider here the lagrangian is @xmath13 .",
    "a typical @xmath5-matrix element is then @xmath14 where the points @xmath15 and @xmath16 are at time @xmath17 and @xmath18 is at @xmath19 .",
    "the integral is over all fields @xmath20 : that is @xmath21 where the product is taken over all space - time points .",
    "we shall not dwell on the precise definition of such integrals but we will consider the situation where the coupling constant @xmath22 is small and we can apply perturbation theory . formally one can consider that the weight factor @xmath23 should be written as @xmath24 in order to get the dimensions correct , and that as planck s constant @xmath25 is very small the integral will be dominated by field values near to the minimum of the action which occurs at @xmath26 . in reality",
    "this is completely bogus , firstly because we are interested in phenomena where the natural scale is set by working in units where @xmath27 , and secondly because our @xmath12 action is not bounded below as @xmath28 . to justify our argument we need to point out that we are really expanding in the powers of @xmath22 rather than @xmath25 , and that for small perturbations about @xmath29 the theory does not notice the `` non - perturbative '' instability of the vacuum .",
    "we could try to be a little less cavalier and consider a @xmath30 interaction instead of or as well as the @xmath12 one , but it turns out that this theory is also sick , and so we will keep things simple and just ignore these problems .",
    "the perturbative expansion we use is just an ( unjustified ) generalization of the method of steepest descents to an infinite dimensional integral .",
    "we add a linear source term @xmath31 to the action so that we can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 z_0(j;0)\\ ] ] where we have written @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where we have introduced the kernel @xmath37 and its green s function @xmath38 with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we obtain the required asymptotic expansion by expanding @xmath39 as a taylor series , and then each resulting term can be drawn as a feynman diagram with the rules that there is a factor of @xmath40 associated with each vertex whose position is integrated over all space - time locations , and a propagator @xmath41 with each edge .",
    "if we fourier transform to momentum space then we obtain the equivalent diagrams but with the rules that momentum is conserved at each vertex and there is an integral over the momentum flowing round each loop , and the propagators become @xmath42 .",
    "the infamous uv divergence disease of qft is now immediately apparent , it manifests itself even if we work in euclidean rather than minkowski space .",
    "even the simplest one - loop diagram corresponding to the euclidean integral @xmath43[(k+p)^2+m^2 ] } < c\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dk\\,\\|k\\|^{n-1}}{\\max(\\|k\\| , m)^4}\\ ] ] for some constant @xmath44 , and this clearly diverges in @xmath45 dimensions .",
    "what saves the day is that the divergence is local ( a dirac @xmath46-function or its derivatives in space - time , or equivalently a polynomial in the external momentum @xmath47 in momentum space ) .",
    "we may see this easily by differentiating the feynman integral with respect to @xmath47 : @xmath48 [ ( k+p)^2+m^2]^2}.\\ ] ] for large @xmath49 the integrand now behaves as @xmath50 rather than @xmath51 as before ; differentiating @xmath52 times suffices to render the integral convergent .",
    "we may therefore express the feynman integral as @xmath53 by iterating the fundamental theorem of calculus @xmath54 times ( otherwise known as taylor s theorem ) where @xmath55 is a polynomial of degree @xmath54 with divergent coefficients .",
    "we have simplified the notation by writing @xmath56 for @xmath57 , suppressing all the tensor indices ( such as @xmath58 ) , and lumping together all the external momenta into one @xmath47 .",
    "we can remove the offending divergent polynomial by adding it to the action as a new term giving rise to a vertex that is formally of one - loop order .",
    "the number of loops in a feynman diagram is formally equal to the corresponding power of @xmath25 in the perturbation expansion , so we may choose to imagine that all the couplings in the action , @xmath22 , @xmath59 , and the coefficient @xmath60 of the kinetic term @xmath61 that we forgot to include originally , may be expanded in powers of @xmath25 where all the terms but the first just serve to remove the unwanted divergences .",
    "clearly there are two requirements that must be satisfied for this to work : ( i )  all the divergences must be of the form of terms that occur in the action , and ( ii )  all the divergences must add up in just the right way to correspond to such counterterms .",
    "we usually rephrase ( i ) by saying that we must include all monomials in the action that are allowed ( i.e. , which do not violate physically necessary conditions such as locality and unitarity ) , as if we do not we will have to come back later and put them in so as to cancel the divergences that arise .",
    "of course , we can only allow there to be a finite number of parameters ( and thus monomials ) in the action if we are to have a theory with any predictive power , but happily we can get away with including only monomials of dimension less than @xmath9 , as this suffices to cancel all possible divergences by a simple power - counting argument  ( q.v . ,   [ sec : powercounting ] ) .      of course this is all rather messy and embarrassing , so we reformulate the procedure in the following language : in order to define a qft we need to introduce a regulator of some kind which makes our manipulations mathematically well - defined .",
    "we then renormalize the theory by adjusting the `` bare '' coefficients in the action to absorb all the would - be divergences , and finally we take the regulator away to obtain a well - defined finite theory as the limit of a renormalized regularized functional integral .",
    "there are many choices of regulator , working in @xmath9 dimensions ( `` dimensional regularization '' @xcite ) is just one rather convenient possibility , and they are all supposed to give the same answer .",
    "what turns out to be crucial is that the regulator preserves as many of the symmetries of the original theory as possible , as we can then exclude counterterms that do not also have these symmetries .      in order to fix the finite parts of the counterterms in the action we need to specify a set of renormalization conditions , i.e. , a set of experimentally determined values for some processes that can be solved for the parameters in the action",
    "this is no different from what happens in classical theories , except that the parameters themselves have a less obvious physical meaning .",
    "indeed , we can choose the renormalization conditions in many different ways ; for example we can specify them as a function of some energy scale @xmath58 , and the fact that they all fix the same physical theory tells us the physical quantities must not depend upon @xmath58 .",
    "the invariance under this group of reparameterizations is known as renormalization group invariance , and is very useful because it is not in general respected by the perturbative expansion to any given order .    the parameters in the action that are just constants on the classical level thus become in general scale dependent if radiative corrections are included . in the context of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ,",
    "our theory of the strong interactions , this leads to asymptotic freedom , the logarithmic decrease of the coupling strength with increasing interaction energy .",
    "for qcd the perturbative approach is limited to the high energy regime where the gauge coupling parameter , @xmath62 is sufficiently small .    in the case of gauge theories ( which are the theories we really use to describe nature ) we must choose renormalization conditions that preserve the gauge symmetries or the whole theory falls apart . on the other hand",
    "there are certain symmetries , such as some forms of chiral symmetry ( a peculiar symmetry that occurs because our theories involve fields that transform as spinor representations of the covering group @xmath63 of the lorentz group @xmath64 ) and scale invariance symmetry can not be maintained by any regulator and thus are not symmetries of the quantum theory even though they look like perfectly good symmetries of the underlying classical action .",
    "there are physical implications of these so - called anomalies , such as the decay of a pion into two photons @xmath65 , and this is evidence that renormalization is necessary and not just an ugly contrivance that we could avoid by being more clever .    what will concern us for the rest of this paper is a more detailed investigation of  ( ii ) , namely showing that all the divergences are local and appear in the right way to be cancelled by counterterms in the action . for instance , if we go beyond one - loop feynman diagrams are all the divergences still local ?",
    "the trouble is that multi - loop feynman diagrams are very complicated integrals , and it is hard to see what is going on without getting lost . nevertheless , with a little effort one can see that a typical two loop diagram @xmath66 has non - local divergences",
    "; however , before abandoning all hope we notice that the one - loop counterterms we introduced to cancel the one - loop divergences have to appear in loop diagrams themselves .",
    "their divergent coefficients thus multiply the non - local finite parts of the corresponding feynman integrals also leading to non - local divergences .",
    "what we must show is that these one loop countergraphs , which are formally of two loop order ( @xmath67 ) exactly cancel the non - local part of our two loop graphs , leaving only a local divergence that can be absorbed by adding local two loop counterterms to the action .",
    "this is most easily done in two stages .",
    "the first is we define a procedure that removes all divergences by local taylor series subtractions , and then we show that the subtractions thus made add up to give local counterterms .",
    "we will discuss the first stage here , as it is what needs to be implemented to automate the renormalization process ; the second is a purely combinatorial proof which the interested reader can find in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the two - loop diagram @xmath66 illustrates the difficulty we face .",
    "clearly when all the loop momenta get large simultaneously the diagram diverges as @xmath70 , and this overall divergence is local .",
    "however , what happens when one of the two three - line loop momenta gets large while the other stays small ?",
    "how do we disentangling these overlapping subdivergences ?",
    "our approach is a systematic decomposition of the space of all loop momenta based on the structure of the graph itself .",
    "we need only consider graphs which are one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) , that is ones which remain connected when any line is cut . for any line @xmath71 in a 1pi feynman diagram",
    "@xmath72 we can decompose the graph uniquely into a single loop containing @xmath71 stringing together a set of 1pi subgraphs that we will call a henge @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we will discuss efficient ways of representing and computing henges in   [ sec : algorithms ] .    clearly at any point the space of all loop momenta some line must carry the smallest ( euclidean ) momentum . hence we may decompose an arbitrary feynman diagram @xmath72 into a sum of contributions each from a region where a particular line @xmath74 carries the smallest momentum , and in each such region we can use our henge decomposition to write the feynman integral as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the feynman integral for the graph @xmath77 restricted to the region of momentum space where all the lines carry momenta of magnitude greater than @xmath22 , and @xmath78 is the product of all the lines in the single loop @xmath79 obtained by shrinking all the graphs in @xmath80 to points , again restricted to have momentum of magnitude greater than @xmath22 .",
    "the `` small momentum cutoff '' @xmath22 serves as a convenient parameter for our recursive definition .    as an example",
    "let us consider the overlapping two - loop diagram we considered before .",
    "its concomitant feynman integral is @xmath81 the henges that arise are @xmath82 , where the heavy lines show the henges corresponding to each of the light lines .",
    "for example , the contribution from the region where the light line in the first diagram is smallest is @xmath83 where @xmath84 and the inner integral ( corresponding to the blob in the diagram on the left and the heavy loop in that on the right ) is @xmath85 observe how the graphical structure dictated the change of variable @xmath86 to the loop momentum of the shrunken graph .    with this decomposition",
    "it is obvious that the divergences can be put into two classes , overall divergences that occur when all the momenta simultaneously get large , and subdivergences that are isolated to the subgraphs occurring in the henges .",
    "let us introduce an operator @xmath87 that removes all the divergences from a given feynman diagram : it first removes all the subdivergences ( an operation that is called @xmath88 ) by recursively applying @xmath87 to the elements of the henges @xmath89 and then it removes the overall divergence ( if necessary ) by subtracting the leading terms of the taylor series expansion in the external momenta as described before for the one - loop case , @xmath90 .",
    "the number of terms removed by the taylor subtraction operation @xmath91 is fixed by simple power counting rules ( q.v . ,  [ sec : powercounting ] ) . note the subtle but vital fact that the subtraction term has its small momentum cutoff set to zero .      in order for this to be a valid renormalization procedure we need to prove two things :",
    "first that all the overall divergences are local  that is polynomial in the external momenta  so that they get eaten by the taylor series subtraction , and second that all the subtractions that are made add up in such a way as to correspond to counterterms in the action .",
    "the former condition is equivalent to showing that the derivatives @xmath92 with respect to the external momenta are finite , and follows by induction from ( a )  the inductive assumption that @xmath93 for some constant @xmath44 , ( b )  the requirement that differentiation lowers the power - counting degree , @xmath94 , and ( c )  the fact that differentiation commutes with the @xmath87 operation , @xmath95=0 $ ] . to prove  ( c ) , as well as the condition  ( ii ) above",
    ", we rewrite the @xmath88 operation in purely graphical form ( as it was originally defined by bogoliubov and parasiuk ) , namely @xmath96 here @xmath97 is a spinney , that is a covering of @xmath72 by a set of 1pi subgraphs ( possibly including single vertices ) , and the proper wood @xmath98 is the set of all such spinneys ( excluding the one consisting of just @xmath72 itself ) .",
    "the notation @xmath99 means that the 1pi subgraph @xmath1 in @xmath72 is to be shrunk to a point and replaced with the value @xmath100 .",
    "proving the equivalence of this definition of @xmath87 to the previous one for @xmath101 is left as an exercise for the dedicated reader who need just show that in the recursive henge decomposition the sequence of subtractions made always correspond to some spinney , and that for each spinney @xmath97 the corresponding subtractions occur in the henge decomposition for every ordering of the line momenta in @xmath102 .",
    "one can expand out the recursion even more and obtain an explicit formula for all the subtractions that are made in a graph in terms of nested non - overlapping taylor subtractions ; the necessary graphical apparatus for this was given by zimmermann @xcite in his forest formula .",
    "zimmermann introduced his forest formula because it explicitly defines a convergent integral corresponding to a feynman diagram without the need for any intermediate regularization scheme .",
    "this property is the reason for our practical use of the @xmath87 operation : we use it to generate the integrand of a manifestly convergent integral , although in practice this is more easily implemented using henge recursion . from a formal point of view the utility of zimmermann s approach",
    "is limited by the fact that although it defines finite integrals these are not directly related to the original functional integral in a straightforward way , and therefore the various identities between feynman integrals that follow because of this that are needed to guarantee desirable properties such as gauge invariance ( ward or brs identities ) or unitarity ( cutting relations ) are no longer manifest .",
    "indeed the former are still untrue in the case of anomalies despite the fact that no regulator is introduced .",
    "the fact that bogoliubov s definition is purely graphical makes it obvious that @xmath95=0 $ ] , and it is also possible to give a combinatorial argument that shows that all the subtractions made , summed over all feynman graphs , formally corresponds to adding @xmath103 to the action  @xcite .",
    "the bph theorem tells us how to remove all the divergences from a feynman diagram by local subtractions , but it does not guarantee that the number of counterterms required is finite .",
    "if it is not then the resulting theory has little if any predictive power , as an infinite number of renormalization conditions will be needed to fix the finite parts of all these new vertices in the theory .",
    "the class of theories that can be renormalized with a finite number of counterterms , called renormalizable theories , is therefore of central interest",
    ". we can give a simple power counting rule that tells us when a theory is renormalizable ( but not the converse ) .    the @xmath104 function introduced in ",
    "[ sec : r ] must be chosen such that @xmath105 for all vertices , propagators ( lines ) , and their derivatives in the feynman rules associating integrals with graphs ; this is the starting point for the inductive proof that @xmath106 that is used to establish the bph theorem in our approach . for our working example of @xmath12 theory in @xmath9 dimensions",
    "the degree of each propagator is @xmath107 and the vertices have degree @xmath108 .",
    "the degree of a graph with @xmath109 internal lines , @xmath110 vertices , and @xmath111 loops is thus @xmath112 , recalling that there is an @xmath9-dimensional momentum integration associated with each loop .",
    "now , any connected graph with @xmath110 vertices has a spanning tree containing exactly @xmath113 edges , and the remaining @xmath114 edges each give rise to an independent loop ; furthermore each internal line has two ends and , in our theory , each vertex connects three lines , so `` conservation of line ends '' implies that @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of external lines . eliminating @xmath111 and @xmath109 from these equations",
    "we find that @xmath117 where the dimension of the field @xmath118 and of the vertex is @xmath119 .",
    "these dimensions can be read directly from the lagrangian describing the theory by some simple rules .",
    "we see that if @xmath120 then we can find arbitrarily overall divergent graphs just by increasing the number of vertices sufficiently , whereas if @xmath121 then only a finite number of graphs can have overall divergences ( such theories are called superrenormalizable ) . the case @xmath122 ( renormalizable ) is particularly interesting as there can be an infinitude of overall divergent graphs , but as their degree is bounded by @xmath123 ( provided this is positive ) only a finite number of green s functions are overall divergent . in four dimensions",
    "@xmath124 we have @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath12 theory , so it is superrenormalizable , whereas in six dimensions @xmath127 and @xmath128 it is renormalizable .",
    "heretofore people have usually calculated feynman integrals by using some regulator to make all the manipulations well - defined and then arranged the resulting expressions to cancel the would - be divergences between graphs and countergraphs , leaving answers with a finite limit as the regulator is removed .",
    "this procedure is effective if all the integrals can be evaluated in closed form , loops is about the same as that to evaluate the finite parts with @xmath71 loops . ] but it is very difficult to completely automate the procedure as the closed - form evaluation of the integrals is a new challenge at each order of the loop expansion .",
    "we wish to use the @xmath87 operation to generate manifestly finite feynman integrals , which we can then evaluate numerically .",
    "the advantages of this approach are obvious , but there is a price to pay .",
    "first , we need to evaluate the albeit finite integrals for every value of the external momenta and parameters ( renormalization conditions ) separately .",
    "second , the integrals are over a unit cube in @xmath129 dimensions ( q.v . ,  [ sec : parameters ] ) where @xmath109 is the number of edges in the graph , and thus we have to resort to monte carlo methods in all but the most trivial cases , so we are only able to achieve limited precision .",
    "third , in most cases where perturbation theory is applicable we are expanding in a small parameter ( the fine structure constant @xmath130 in qed for example ) , so there is no point in computing the @xmath131 loop contributions unless the errors at @xmath71 loops are sufficiently small .",
    "our window of opportunity is to compute one loop higher order that the current best closed - form solutions .",
    "we now consider how we can implement the @xmath87 operation in practice in our symbolic ",
    "numeric scheme .",
    "it is much easier to implement the more recursive henge approach than bogoliubov s definition or zimmermann s explicit forest formula , as the complexity of the problem is then naturally handled by a correspondingly recursive program . to do this we need some reasonably efficient graph manipulation algorithms , as the text - book methods using adjacency matrices and suchlike are slow in practice .",
    "fortunately such algorithms are well - known , such as the galler ",
    "fisher @xcite algorithm for finding equivalence classes given pairwise equivalence relations , which may be equivalently viewed as a means of splitting a graph into its connected components .",
    "the basic idea is to represent a graph as a set of edges each represented as a pair of vertices , and to label the vertices with small integers ; for instance the graph @xmath66 could be represented as @xmath132 .",
    "we create an array @xmath133 indexed by vertices and initialised to some special value ( such as zero ) , and then run once through the edges @xmath134 computing the ancestor of each of its vertices , where the ancestor @xmath135 is @xmath136 if @xmath137 = 0 $ ] or @xmath138)$ ] otherwise .",
    "if the ancestors are unequal @xmath139 then we set @xmath140 \\gets a(j)$ ] . when we have exhausted the supply of edges the ancestor of any vertex labels the connected component that the vertex belongs to .",
    "this algorithm is pleasantly easy to extend to carry out other graphical tasks efficiently . to find all the irreducible edges in a connected graph ( those that may be cut without disconnecting it ) we just keep track of the route from a vertex to its ancestor by introducing an @xmath141 chain chain is a sum of edges with coefficients  @xmath142 or  @xmath143.]-valued array @xmath144 indexed by vertices that contains the chain of edges connecting @xmath136 to @xmath137 $ ] , and defining the route @xmath145 from @xmath136 to @xmath135 to be zero if @xmath146 or the chain @xmath147 \\oplus r(f[i])$ ] otherwise .",
    "upon examining the edge @xmath134 we note that the chain @xmath148 connects @xmath135 to @xmath149 , so if @xmath139 as well as updating @xmath137 $ ] as above we also set @xmath150\\gets c_{ij}$ ] . if , on the other hand , @xmath151 then we have discovered that @xmath152 is a closed loop , and all the edges occurring in this loop are marked as irreducible .",
    "all the edges not so marked by the end of the loop over edges are reducible .",
    "one use of this algorithm is to route momenta through a graph .",
    "we multiply each loop by a symbol for the corresponding loop momentum , and for each vertex @xmath136 at which external momentum @xmath47 enters the graph we multiply the route @xmath145 by @xmath47 .",
    "the coefficient of any edge in the sum of all these @xmath47-chains - chain consists of sums of edges with coefficients being @xmath153 symbolic names for momenta . ]",
    "is the momentum flowing through that edge .",
    "indeed , it is but a small step further to devise an efficient henge - finding algorithm .",
    "start with a 1pi graph @xmath72 and remove any edge  @xmath71 ; as @xmath72 is just a set of edges this graph is just the set of edges @xmath154 .",
    "now apply the previous algorithm to this graph , partitioning the lines into two sets @xmath155 of irreducible lines and reducible lines , and apply the first algorithm to partition @xmath109 into disconnected pieces @xmath156 .",

    "we have implemented the subtractions specified by the @xmath87 operation on an arbitrary diagram in @xmath12 theory , and the generalization to more interesting theories with more complicated actions is both straightforward and in progress .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting for the benefit of the dedicated reader who has thought about the equivalence of the henge and bogoliubov definitions of @xmath87 that too nave an implementation of the former will produce the same spinney multiple times , corresponding to different orderings of lines in @xmath159 .",
    "we have described in some detail the means of obtaining a finite feynman integral , but we still have to evaluate it . there are various ways of doing this : we could for example directly evaluate the loop integrals in momentum space , leading to an @xmath160-fold real integral . for some regulators , such as the lattice , where we discretize the functional integral by approximating space - time by a hypercubic grid",
    ", this is essentially the only way to proceed . in practice , however , we usual carry out perturbative qft calculations using dimensional regularization in which case all of the propagators are essentially inverse quadratic forms in the momenta , as we used above . in this case",
    "there is a convenient @xmath1 function identity that allows us to write a product of such propagators as a power of a single quadratic form @xmath161 this can be iterated to establish the formula @xmath162^n } ,    \\label{eq : feynmanparameters}\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath163 being known as feynman parameters .    introducing feynman parameters and interchanging the order of the momentum and parameter integrals ( which is valid in the presence of a regulator ) we can combine all @xmath164 loop momenta into a single vector and carry out the momentum integration using another @xmath1 function identity , @xmath165^\\alpha } = \\pi^\\omega \\frac{\\gamma(\\alpha -\\omega)}{\\gamma ( \\alpha ) } f(p , m)^{\\omega-\\alpha}\\ ] ] and related formul  obtained from this by differenting with respect to the external momentum  @xmath47 .",
    "we are then left with @xmath109 parameter integrals to evaluate , in our case numerically .",
    "it is interesting to see how the henge decomposition is reflected in feynman parameter space . to this end",
    "we define a sector of feynman parameter space as a region where the parameters are totally ordered , for example one such sector is @xmath166 .",
    "if we restrict the integral in equation  ( [ eq : feynmanparameters ] ) to this sector we find @xmath167^n } \\\\    & & \\hskip4 cm = \\frac1{(n-1 ) ! }",

    "this means that the quadratic form denominator @xmath91 corresponding to parameter @xmath169 is guaranteed to be smaller than all the other denominators , which means that it corresponds to a line carrying the smallest momentum in the henge decomposition .",
    "we note in passing that especially in the context of overlapping ir divergences the the iterated application of sector decomposition has proved to be a powerful way to deal numerically not only with multi - loop feynman diagrams @xcite but also high - dimensional phase - space integrals  @xcite .",
    "in this pedagogical presentation we have illustrated our calculations using only scalar fields ; in general we need to introduce vector fields for gauge bosons and spinor fields for fermions , these lead to the additional complication of having tensor expression in the feynman integrand numerators .",
    "actually our symbolic manipulation code already has to deal with such numerators , as they occur when we taylor subtract even for scalar theories .",
    "what we end up with is some complicated @xmath175 tensor expressions which need to be simplified into some canonical form ; these expressions can themselves be viewed as graphs , where the tensors are the vertices and the edges are pairs of contracted indices , and we use the algorithms of section   [ sec : algorithms ] to carry out this simplification .    for spinors , which strictly speaking",
    "are representations of the universal covering group @xmath176 of @xmath177 , the numerators also become functions of spinor operators built out of the dirac ( clifford ) algebra generators @xmath178 that satisfy the anticommutation relations @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the metric tensor .",
    "efficient algorithms are known for simplifying @xmath0 matrix expressions @xcite and have been implemented in the reduce package cvit @xcite ; these algorithms are based on reducing the `` spin - network '' or `` birdtrack '' diagrams in terms of sums of irreducible representations of @xmath176 and their @xmath181 and @xmath182 coefficients .",

    "there are two different situations to consider :    * there are true ir divergences that make the theory meaningless .",
    "for example , massless scalar field theory does not exist because it is ir sick in this manner .",
    "* there are ir singularities that occur at special values of the external momenta .",
    "the emission of a zero - energy photon in qed exemplifies this situation .",
    "we shall reject theories in the first case , whereas in the second we evade the problem by insisting that on physical grounds one must average the cross - section for emission of soft photons ( brehmsstrahlung ) over some experimental resolution for the detection of the photon energy .",
    "the crucial observation is that while the green s functions may have ir divergences the cross - sections smeared over experimental resolutions are always finite . at the diagrammatic level what happens",
    "is that there are cancellations between loop integrals ( or feynman parameter integrals ) and phase space integrals , so our intention is to extend our program to treat loop and phases space integrals consistently .",
    "what we must do is to ensure that all divergences cancel locally in the integrand , just as we do for green s functions by our use of the @xmath87 operation .",
    "to this end we intend to generate the integrands for cross sections by representing them as cut bubble diagrams , where the cut propagators correspond to on - shell particles convoluted with the experimental resolution functions .",

    "we therefore need to generate efficient numerical code to evaluate the integrand for use within our special - purpose monte carlo integration programs .",
    "it is not too important which language is used , our example is in c but it would be trivial to generate fortran if that was preferred .      the computational model that form uses is to stream a sum of many terms from disk to disk , either applying pattern - based transformations or sorting and collecting terms as the data passes through the processor .",
    "this model is justified by the huge size of the expressions that are generated in realistic feynman diagram computations , unlike the toy example of figure  [ fig : examplemaple ] . while our maple program works well on moderate size problems it dies a horrible death when the entire problem no longer fits in memory .",
    "we suggest that the huge intermediate expressions generated are not really an intrinsic property of the problem , but are an artefact of the way we think about and implement the programs .",
    "to be specific , our program first applies the @xmath87 operation generating a sum of taylor subtraction terms as it recurses through the henge decomposition ; it then runs through all these terms converting them into feynman parameter integrals ; it simplifies the tensor structures in the numerators ; and it then collects all the terms with similar quadratic forms in their denominator before finally generating c code .",
    "this multi - pass approach is not necessary , it is just convenient for thinking about and debugging the program , as it separates the computation into logically independent steps .",
    "we could avoid generating huge intermediate expressions by generating the terms lazily , and this could be done declaratively without altering the logic of the program if maple implemented a lazy map primitive , or a yield statement for use within loops .",
    "we would then generate each term and immediately apply subsequent operations on it until we reach the `` collection '' phase , in which terms could be collected into elements of a hashed array .",
    "eventually this approach will still run out of memory if this array has to live in ( virtual ) memory , but this could be circumvented by writing the array elements to disk when necessary .",
    "current perturbative calculations in qft are unthinkable without the use of computer algebra . whether this requires domain - specific languages such as form or more careful memory choreography in general purpose systems such as maple remains to be seen .",
    "all of the pieces of the calculation , including renormalization , can be fully automated except for evaluation of the feynman parameter integrals where the lack of closed - form solutions forces us into the arms of numerical integration .",
