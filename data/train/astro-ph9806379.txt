    "the galaxy and m31 are surrounded by small companion galaxies .",
    "some of them belong to the classification category called `` dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) . '' through recent observations , we have been obtaining the properties of the local group dsphs .",
    "the dsphs have luminosities of order @xmath10@xmath11 , and are characterized by their low surface brightnesses ( gallagher & wyse 1994 for review ) .",
    "the knowledges of such low - luminosity objects are important for some reasons .",
    "for example , in a galaxy formation theory based on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , low mass galaxies are considered to be the first bound luminous objects ( e.g. , blumenthal et al . 1984 ) .",
    "thus , the dsphs are expected to have dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "observations of velocity dispersions of dsphs ( aaronson 1983 ; see also mateo et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) indicate too large virial mass to be accounted for by the visible stars in the dsphs . in other words , dsphs have generally high mass - to - luminosity ratio",
    "this fact can imply the presence of dm in these systems ( e.g. , mateo et al .",
    "the large spatial distribution of stars to their outer regions ( faber & lin 1983 ) also suggests the existence of dm .",
    "however , if a dwarf galaxy orbiting the galaxy is significantly perturbed by galactic tides , observed velocity dispersion of the dwarf can be larger than gravitationally equilibrium dispersion ( kuhn & miller 1989 ; kroupa 1997 ) .",
    "moreover , bellazzini , fusi pecci , & ferraro ( 1996 ) pointed out that there is a strong correlation between tidal forces by the galaxy and the surface brightnesses of the dsphs and that this correlation supports the strong tidal perturbation by the galaxy .",
    "hirashita , kamaya , & takeuchi ( 1998 , paper i ) , however , showed that this correlation is not exclusively supports the tidal picture , since it may reflect the correlation between the galactocentric distances and the surface brightnesses of the dsphs .",
    "paper i seem to support the dm - dominated picture of the dsphs .",
    "piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) and oh , lin , & aarseth ( 1995 ) showed by numerical simulations that it is difficult to inflate the central velocity dispersion of dsphs by tidal force and to account for the apparent large virial mass calculated from the observed velocity dispersions .    the dsphs are known to contain such a small amount of gas that they show little evidence of recent star formation ( e.g. , gallagher & wyse 1994 ) .",
    "saito ( 1979a ) showed that instantaneous gas ejection from supernovae ( sne ) can make the gas in proto - dsphs escape ( see also larson 1974 ) .",
    "however , he considered only self - gravity of gas : the dm potential , whose existence is both observationally and theoretically supported as mentioned above , is not taken into account . in the presence of dm potential",
    "well , the gas may not easily escape ( mac low & ferrara 1998 , hereafter mf98 ; ferrara & tolstoy 1998 , hereafter ft98 ) .",
    "dekel & silk ( 1986 ) showed that the sn feedback mechanism nicely accounts for the observed scaling relations of mass , luminosity and metallicity of each dsph , taking into account the presence of dm halo ( see also peterson & caldwell 1993 ) .    since recent observations of the local group dsphs provide us data with much better quality than those in ten years ago , we re - examined the relation of observed quantities of the dsphs",
    ". we will consider initial star formation ( sf ) and sn feedback in the formation epochs of the dsphs with the dm - dominated picture , in order to derive the present relation between their virial mass and luminosity .",
    "total bolometric luminosity and virial mass of a dsph are denoted as @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "first of all , in the next section , we present the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 for the local group dsphs .",
    "the condition for the blow - away by sne is explained in  3 .",
    "we present a physical interpretation of the @xmath3@xmath1 relation in  4 .",
    "the final section is devoted to the summary .",
    "in this section , we present the observed properties of the local group dsphs .",
    "we focus on their virial mass @xmath1 and total bolometric luminosity @xmath2 .",
    "the virial mass is derived from the internal velocity dispersion by using the king - model fitting ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) .",
    "we used the compiled data in table 11 of mateo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for the virial masses and the total luminosities for draco , carina , ursa minor , sextans , sculptor , fornax , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 . for leo i",
    ", we used the data in zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , caldwell et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and lee et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and for leo ii , we refer to vogt et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( see also table 1 of paper i ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath1 for the above 11 dsphs .",
    "we divide these galaxies into two groups ; the lower - mass group ( group l ; draco , carina , ursa minor , sextans , sculptor , leo i and leo ii ) and the higher - mass group ( group h ; fornax , ngc 147 , ngc 185 , and ngc 205 ) . the virial mass of the former group is less than @xmath9 , while that of the latter is more than @xmath9 .",
    "we see that @xmath3 of group h is almost constant , though the number of samples is small .",
    "analyses with larger number including samples out of the local group show that bright dwarf spheroidals ( dwarf ellipticals ) are on a distinct sequence from group l ( bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ; peterson & caldwell 1993 ) though the dispersion of @xmath3 is large ( an order of magnitude ) .    as for group h , the constant @xmath3 may be due to the inefficiency of escape of sn - heated gas ( dekel & silk 1986 ; mf98 ; ft98 ) , since the potential of dm is deep .",
    "this is discussed in the next section . on the other hand , for galaxies belonging to group",
    "l , the gas easily escapes out of them once their gas is heated by sne ( saito 1979a ) and ob - star radiation , because of their shallow gravitational potentials .",
    "we discuss this point later in  4 .",
    "we note that the two groups can be distinguished in the @xmath12@xmath13 plot ( figure 8 of vogt et al .",
    "our plot in figure 1 ( @xmath12@xmath14 plot ) makes the separation of the groups prominent .",
    "the log - linear regression for the quantities in group l is @xmath15 and the correlation coefficient is 0.92 , which shows a strong correlation . for the correlation study for other quantities concerning the local group dsphs ,",
    "see bellazzini , fusi pecci , & ferraro ( 1996 ) , and paper i. an interpretation of equation ( [ reg ] ) is discussed in  4 .",
    "as discussed by saito ( 1979a ) , sn - driven winds blow the gas in low - mass proto - galaxies away because of their shallow potential wells .",
    "recent numerical simulations of sn - driven wind at initial starburst of low - mass galaxies ( mf98 ; ft98 ) showed that if their gas mass is more than @xmath16 , the gas ejection efficiency is very low .",
    "this mass corresponds to @xmath17 if the mass fraction of baryon is 0.1 .",
    "this value agrees with the separation line of the two groups ( h and l ; figure 1 ) .",
    "this fact is physically interpreted as follows .",
    "galaxies with @xmath7 form stars whose total mass is proportional to the initial gas mass , which leads to the constant mass - to - light ratio ( dekel & silk 1986 ) .",
    "on the other hand , galaxies with @xmath5 blow the gas away soon after the formation of the first - generation stars : if a little fraction of gas becomes stars , the sne resulting from these stars are enough to blow away the rest of the gas ( saito 1979a ; nath & chiba 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the members in the low - mass category tend to have little baryonic matter ( i.e. , higher @xmath3 ) .",
    "equation ( [ reg ] ) shows that the virial mass and total luminosity of the lower - mass group ( group l ) in figure 1 satisfy the relation , @xmath18 the error of the index is obtained from the uncertainty of @xmath14 ( typically @xmath19 ; estimated from the uncertainty of galactocentric distance and velocity dispersion ) . in this section",
    ", we will derive this relation by considering the physical processes in the formation epoch .",
    "the presence of dm in dsphs is indicated by observations of velocity dispersions ( e.g. , mateo et al .",
    "1993 ; but see kuhn & miller 1989 ) .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to consider the gas collapse in dm potential to form proto - dsphs .",
    "we assume that the distribution of dm is not affected by baryon , since the mass fraction of baryon is much lower than dm ( e.g. , bahcall 1997 ) .",
    "we assume that the initial star formation rate ( sfr ) of a dsph is determined by the cooling time @xmath20 ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the free - fall time @xmath23 yr ) .",
    "we , here , note that the free - fall time is determined by the dm mass density @xmath24 , while the cooling time is determined by the gas density .",
    "the cooling time @xmath20 is determined by the density and temperature of the gas as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cooling function .",
    "since the virial temperature of such a low mass galaxy is much lower than @xmath27 k , the cooling is dominated by h and he recombination ( rees & ostriker 1977 ) : @xmath28 ( peacock & heavens 1990 ) . from the above assumption that the sfr is determined by the cooling timescale",
    ", we obtain the following expression for the sfr ( @xmath29 ) : @xmath30 the temperature in the quasistatic collapse phase is determined by virial temperature ( rees & ostriker 1977 ) .",
    "thus , the following expression for the temperature is satisfied : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the typical size of the dm distribution . using the scaling relation of virial mass and size ( saito 1979b ; nath & chiba 1995 ) ; @xmath33",
    ", we obtain from relations ( [ sfr ] ) and ( [ virial ] ) @xmath34 where we assume that the initial mass ratio of gas to dm is constant ( i.e. , @xmath35 . )    in normal galaxies , the sf is stopped in the epoch of onset of galactic wind , when the thermal energy produced by sne becomes equal to the binding energy of the galaxy ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "however , in dwarf galaxies belonging to the low - mass group , the heating by uv photons from first - generation ob stars is large enough to supply the thermal energy equal to the gravitational potential ( @xmath36 ob stars @xmath37 ob association ) .",
    "thus the remaining gas in a low - mass dwarf evaporates from the system soon after the formation of first - generation stars .",
    "we estimate the sf - terminating time by using the crossing time of the wind generated in an ob association .",
    "the velocity of the wind is estimated by the sound speed @xmath38 of @xmath27 k , which is a typical temperature of the heated gas .",
    "the crossing time @xmath39 is estimated as @xmath40 .",
    "if we keep @xmath38 constant , the following expression for the @xmath39 is obtained by using the above scaling law @xmath33 : @xmath41 we note that the typical value for @xmath39 becomes @xmath42 yr ( for @xmath43 kpc and @xmath44 km s@xmath45 ) , which is shorter than the cooling time .",
    "thus , the formation of the second - generation stars is difficult .",
    "the total mass of the stars , @xmath46 , is estimated by @xmath47 .",
    "thus , from relations ( [ scale ] ) an ( [ cross ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 this relation means that the mass - to - light ratio is scaled as @xmath49 where @xmath2 is considered to be proportional to @xmath46 .    comparing the observed relation ( [ obs ] ) with the theoretical prediction ( [ theor ] )",
    ", we see that the two agree well in the range of the observational error .",
    "we note that it is difficult to obtain an absolute value for the mass of the formed stars , since the star formation efficiency is uncertain .",
    "thus , we here only calculate the scaling relation .",
    "we discuss a physical interpretation of the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the virial mass and the total luminosity of a dsph , respectively .",
    "we used 11 dsphs in the local group as the sample .",
    "we find two distinct sequences on the @xmath3@xmath1 plane : @xmath4 for dsphs with @xmath5 , whereas @xmath6 constant for @xmath7 .",
    "a `` discontinuity '' is seen at @xmath8 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we interpret the `` discontinuity '' as the threshold for the gas in dsphs to be blown away by successive supernovae ( mf98 ; ft98 ) .",
    "if a dsph has virial mass ( most of which is dark mass ) less than @xmath9 , the gas is blown away , while in a dsph with larger mass , the deep potential well prevents the blow - away mechanism from working effectively .",
    "thus , large mass ratio of dm to gas ( i.e. , large @xmath3 ) is realized in a low - mass ( @xmath5 ) dsph through the gas depletion , whereas @xmath3 becomes lower in high - mass ( @xmath7 ) dsphs .",
    "we further explained the above relation for the low - mass dsphs , @xmath4 based on estimate of cooling time .",
    "we used scaling laws of virial temperature , virial mass and radius of dwarf spheroidals .",
    "the timescale for the duration of sf is estimated by the crossing time of ob - association - heated wind , since the heating by ob - star photons is effective in low - mass systems .",
    "we finally note that this condition for the cessation of sf in low - mass dsphs is different from that in higher - mass galaxies where the sn heating is essential to terminate the sf .",
