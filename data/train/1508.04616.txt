    "the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect @xcite , @xcite is one of the most striking distinguishes between quantum and classical words . in a nutshell ,",
    "it states that a quantum particle feels electro - magnetic potentials even though no classical forces exist .",
    "its first description can be traced to the paper of ehrenberg and siday @xcite , but it is only after the seminal work of aharonov and bohm @xcite that this subject attracts a wide attention .",
    "the success of that paper can be attributed to the fact that in addition to a general discussion of the phenomenon the authors presented a clear - cut analytic calculation of physical scattering on one singular ab vortex thus validating common arguments .",
    "today there exists a huge literature about this effect but , surprisingly , analytically results are rare . in @xcite a diagrammatic - like",
    "series for the amplitude of scattering on a few ab vortices had been proposed but for real energy it is similar to a formal multiple scattering expansion and hardly can be used for calculations .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the problem of scattering on two ab vortices .",
    "the principal result is that this problem is integrable and the calculations of the green function and the scattering amplitude can be reduced to a solution of a series of differential equations whose lowest level includes the painlev v ( or iii ) equation .",
    "the method used in derivation of these results is a generalization of the one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the diffraction on a finite slit has been treated .",
    "it is based on the point - like nature of the ab potential which permits to fix solutions by fixing its behavior near vortex positions .",
    "it means that only a few constants uniquely determine the full solution .",
    "using different transformations commuting with the laplacian leads to a system of equations for these constants . besides equations , it is necessary to know the values of different quantities at small and/or large distances between vortices . for large vortex separation",
    "it can be done by perturbation series and for small distances between vortices it is achieved by the using riemann - hilbert method .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section  [ general_considerations ] is devoted to a general discussion of the problem of scattering on ab vortices .",
    "special attention in this section is focused on the uniqueness of the solution and , in particular , on the fact that any solution obeying all boundary and radiation conditions but without in - coming incident waves is identically zero . in sections  [ green_function]-[scattering_amplitude ] it",
    "is demonstrated how the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to the case of two vortices .",
    "first of all , a set of auxiliary functions independent of incident fields with prescribed singularities at vortex positions are introduced .",
    "these functions are analogues of the hankel functions for one - vortex problem and play a prominent role in what follows . the main idea of ref .",
    "@xcite is that there exists a group of differential operators which commute with the lagrangian and cancel the incident field .",
    "transformed solution is non - zero as the action of these group operators change boundary conditions near vortices .",
    "but these changes can be compensated by a suitable linear combination of new functions . in this manner one",
    "gets a set of equations for unknown functions .",
    "calculation of group commutators done in section  [ determination_constants ] permits to find equations for all necessary functions . in section  [ green_function ] the green function",
    "is discussed and in section  [ scattering_amplitude ] this procedure is done for the scattering amplitude . to use the obtained equations one needs to find the asymptotics of correct solutions at small and/or at large separation between vortices .",
    "this is achieved in section  [ small_distance ] where explicit forms of the solution when the distance between vortices tends to zero and to infinity are obtained .",

    "the relation of these results to the theory of holonomic quantum field @xcite is in short discussed here .",
    "appendix  [ uniqueness ] is devoted to the proof of the uniqueness of the solution and to derivation of the reciprocity relation for the scattering on two ab vortices . in appendix  [ one_vortex ] properties of one - vortex solution",
    "are briefly discussed .    to diminish the paper size only the main steps of derivations are presented and details are often omitted .",
    "the ab vector potential , @xmath0 , is a pure gauge potential , @xmath1 , and can be removed by a gauge transformation .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of ab vortices manifests in non - zero circulation along any closed contour encircling only vortex @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic flux associated with the vortex ( we assume that @xmath5 integer ) .    the existence of a non - zero circulation implies that after potential removing from each vortex emanates a line of phase discontinuity ( the cut ) denoted @xmath6 such that the function and its normal derivative on the both sides of the cut differ by a phase @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are coordinate respectively along and perpendicular to the cut .",
    "each cut has two different sides which can be connected by a contour encircling one or more vortices .",

    "[ contour ] a convenient choice of cuts for two ab vortices used throughout the paper is sketched .        in this case",
    "the two cuts coincide along the negative @xmath8-axis and boundary values of wave function and its @xmath9-derivative on the cut are related as follows @xmath10 where piece - wise constant function @xmath11 is @xmath12 and subscripts @xmath13 corresponds to limit @xmath14 from positive and negative values of @xmath9 respectively .",

    "the proof of this fact can be done by a generalization of usual arguments developed for diffraction problems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for completeness , we present in appendix  [ uniqueness ] a brief demonstration of uniqueness stressing the necessity of all requirements ( a)-(e ) .",

    "let us introduce auxiliary functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 independent of the incident field which obey all the conditions - except that at one vortex indicated by @xmath2 they have the following asymptotic behavior @xmath46 these functions are uniquely fixed by these conditions and will play an important role below .    the uniqueness of the solution together with point - like character of boundary conditions permit to find different equations between functions @xmath47 @xcite .",
