    "the macmahon master theorem is one of the jewels in enumerative combinatorics , and it is as famous and useful as it is mysterious .",
    "most recently , a new type of algebraic generalization was proposed in  @xcite and was further studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present further generalizations of the macmahon master theorem and several other related results . while our generalizations are algebraic in statement , the heart of our proofs is completely bijective , unifying all generalizations .",
    "in fact , we give a new bijective proof of the ( usual ) macmahon master theorem , modulo some elementary linear algebra .",
    "our approach seems to be robust enough to allow further generalizations in this direction .",
    "let us begin with a brief outline of the history of the subject .",
    "the master theorem was discovered in 1915 by percy macmahon in his landmark two - volume _",
    "`` combinatory analysis '' _ , where he called it `` a master theorem in the theory of partitions ''  @xcite . much later , in the early sixties",
    ", the real power of master theorem was discovered , especially as a simple tool for proving binomial identities ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of the macmahon master theorem using lagrange inversion is now standard , and the result is often viewed in the analytic context  @xcite .",
    "an algebraic approach to macmahon master theorem goes back to foata s thesis  @xcite , parts of which were later expanded in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the idea was to view the theorem as a result on `` words '' over a ( partially commutative ) alphabet , so one can prove it and generalize it by means of simple combinatorial and algebraic considerations .",
    "this approach became highly influential and led to a number of new related results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    while the master theorem continued to be extended in several directions ( see  @xcite ) , the `` right '' q- and non - commutative analogues of the results evaded discovery until recently . this was in sharp contrast with the lagrange inversion , whose @xmath1- and non - commutative analogues were understood fairly well  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no reasonable generalizations of the master theorem followed from these results .",
    "an important breakthrough was made by garoufalidis , l and zeilberger ( glz ) , who introduced a new type of @xmath1-analogue , with a puzzling algebraic statement and a technical proof  @xcite . in a series of papers , foata and han",
    "first modified and extended the cartier - foata combinatorial approach to work in this algebraic setting , obtaining a new ( involutive ) proof of the glz - theorem  @xcite .",
    "then they developed a beautiful `` 1 = q '' principle which gives perhaps the most elegant explanation of the results  @xcite .",
    "they also analyze a number of specializations in  @xcite .",
    "most recently , hai and lorenz gave an interesting algebraic proof of the glz - theorem , opening yet another direction for exploration ( see section  [ s : final ] ) .",
    "this paper presents a number of generalizations of the macmahon master theorem in the style of cartier - foata and garoufalidis - l - zeilberger .",
    "our approach is bijective and is new even in the classical cases , where it is easier to understand .",
    "this is reflected in the structure of the paper : we present generalizations one by one , gradually moving from well known results to new ones .",
    "the paper is largely self - contained and no background is assumed .",
    "we begin with basic definitions , notations and statements of the main results in section  [ s : basic ] .",
    "the proof of the ( usual ) macmahon master theorem is given in section  [ macm ] . while the proof here is elementary , it is the basis for our approach . a straightforward extension to the cartier - foata case",
    "is given in section  [ cf ] .",
    "the right - quantum case is presented in section  [ rq ] .",
    "this is a special case of the glz - theorem , when @xmath2 .",
    "then we give a @xmath1-analogue of the cartier - foata case ( section  [ cfq ] ) , and the glz - theorem ( section  [ q ] ) .",
    "the subsequent results are our own and can be summarized as follows :    @xmath3  the cartier - foata @xmath4-analogue ( section  [ cfqij ] ) .",
    "@xmath3  the right - quantum @xmath4-analogue ( section  [ qij ] ) .",
    "@xmath3  the super - analogue ( section  [ super ] ) .",
    "@xmath3  the @xmath0-extension ( section  [ beta ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4-analogues are our main result ; one of them specializes to the glz - theorem when all @xmath5 .",
    "the super - analogue is a direct extension of the classical macmahon master theorem to commuting and anti - commuting variables .",
    "having been overlooked in previous investigations , it is a special case of the @xmath4-analogue , with some @xmath6 and others  @xmath7 .",
    "our final extension is somewhat tangential to the main direction , but is similar in philosophy .",
    "we show that our proof of the macmahon master theorem can be easily modified to give a non - commutative generalization of the so called @xmath8-extension , due to foata and zeilberger  @xcite .    in section  [ ks ]",
    "we present one additional observation on the subject . in  @xcite , krattenthaler and schlosser",
    "obtained an intriguing @xmath1-analogue of the macmahon master theorem , a result which on the surface does not seem to fit the above scheme .",
    "we prove that in fact it follows from the classical cartier - foata generalization .",
    "as the reader shall see , an important technical part of our proof is converting the results we obtain into traditional form .",
    "this is basic linear algebra in the classical case , but in non - commutative cases the corresponding determinant identities are either less known or new . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we present concise proofs of all of them in section  [ proofs ] .",
    "we conclude the paper with final remarks and open problems .",
    "we begin by stating the master theorem in the classical form :    [ macm1 ] ( macmahon master theorem ) let @xmath9 be a complex matrix , and let @xmath10 be a set of variables",
    ". denote by @xmath11 the coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath13 let @xmath14 be another set of variables , and @xmath15 .",
    "then @xmath16 where the summation is over all nonnegative integer vectors @xmath17 .    by taking @xmath18 we get @xmath19 whenever both sides of the equation are well defined , for example when all @xmath20 are formal variables . moreover , replacing @xmath20 in   with @xmath21 shows",
    "that   is actually equivalent to  .",
    "we will use this observation throughout the paper .      consider the following algebraic setting .",
    "denote by  @xmath22 the algebra ( over  @xmath23 ) of formal power series with non - commuting variables @xmath20 , @xmath24 .",
    "elements of @xmath22 are infinite linear combinations of words in variables @xmath20 ( with coefficients in  @xmath23 ) . in most cases we will take elements of @xmath22 modulo some ideal  @xmath25 generated by a finite number of relations .",
    "for example , if  @xmath25 is generated by @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is the symmetric algebra ( the free commutative algebra with @xmath29 variables @xmath20 , @xmath24 ) .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume that @xmath10 commute with  @xmath20 , and that @xmath30 and @xmath31 commute up to some nonzero complex weight , i.e. that @xmath32 with @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we can then expand the expression @xmath35 move all @xmath30 s to the right and order them . along the way",
    ", we will exchange pairs of variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 , producing a product of  @xmath36 s .",
    "we can then extract the coefficient at @xmath12 .",
    "as before , we will denote this coefficient by @xmath11 .",
    "each such coefficient will be a finite sum of products of a monomial in @xmath36 s , @xmath37 , and a word @xmath38 , such that @xmath39 , the number of variables @xmath40 is equal to  @xmath41 , and the number of variables @xmath42 is equal to  @xmath43 .    to make sense of the right - hand side of in the non - commutative case , we need to generalize the determinant . throughout the paper the ( non - commutative ) determinant",
    "will be given by the formula @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a permutation and @xmath46 is a certain constant weight of  @xmath47 .",
    "of course , @xmath48 is the usual case , where @xmath49 is the number of inversions in  @xmath50 .",
    "now , in all cases we consider the weight of the identity permutation will be equal to @xmath51 : @xmath52 .",
    "substituting @xmath53 in  , this gives us @xmath54 where  @xmath55 is a certain finite sum of words in  @xmath20 and both left and right inverse of @xmath56 are equal to the infinite sum on the right .",
    "from now on , whenever justified , we will always use the fraction notation as above in non - commutative situations .    in summary",
    ", we just showed that both @xmath57 are well - defined elements of @xmath22 .",
    "the generalizations of the master theorem we present in this paper will state that these two expressions are equal modulo a certain ideal  @xmath25 . in the classical case",
    ", the macmahon master theorem gives that for the ideal @xmath58 generated by @xmath26 , for all @xmath59 .",
    "fix complex numbers @xmath34 , where @xmath60 .",
    "suppose the variables @xmath10 are @xmath61-commuting : @xmath62 and that they commute with all @xmath20 .",
    "suppose also that the variables @xmath20 @xmath61-commute within columns : @xmath63 and in addition satisfy the following quadratic equations : @xmath64 we call @xmath65 with entries satisfying   and   a _ right - quantum @xmath66-matrix_.    for a matrix @xmath67 , define the @xmath66-_determinant _ by @xmath68 where @xmath69    [ t : main ] let @xmath70 be a right - quantum @xmath66-matrix . denote the coefficient of @xmath12 in @xmath71 by @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath72 where the summation is over all nonnegative integer vectors @xmath17 .    theorem  [ t : main ] is the ultimate extension of the classical macmahon master theorem .",
    "our proof of the theorem uses a number of technical improvements which become apparent in special cases . while the proof is given in section  [ qij ] , it is based on all previous sections .",
    "let @xmath73 be an invertible @xmath74 matrix over  @xmath23 . denote by @xmath75 the matrix @xmath76 without the first row and the first column , by @xmath77 the matrix @xmath76 without the first two rows and the first two columns , etc . for the entries of the inverse matrix we have : @xmath78 substituting @xmath79 and iterating  , we obtain : @xmath80 provided that all minors are invertible . now let @xmath20 be commuting variables as in subsection  [ ss : basic - words ] .",
    "we obtain that the right - hand side of equation   is the product of entries in the inverses of matrices , and we need to prove the following identity : @xmath81    since @xmath82 , we get a combinatorial interpretation of the @xmath83-entry : @xmath84 where the summation is over all finite sequences @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "a combinatorial interpretation of the other product terms is analogous .",
    "recall that we already have a combinatorial interpretation of @xmath11 as a summation of words .",
    "therefore , we have reduced the master theorem to an equality between two summations of words  , where all the summands have a positive sign .",
    "to finish the proof we construct an explicit bijection between the families of words corresponding to both sides .      throughout the paper we consider _ lattice steps _ of the form @xmath88 for some @xmath89 , @xmath24",
    "we think of @xmath90 being drawn along @xmath90-axis , increasing from left to right , and refer to  @xmath91 and  @xmath92 as the _ starting height _ and _ ending height _ , respectively .    from here on , we represent the step @xmath88 by the variable  @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , we represent a finite sequence of steps by a word in the alphabet @xmath93 , @xmath24 , i.e. by an element of algebra @xmath22 .",
    "if each step in a sequence starts at the ending point of the previous step , we call such a sequence a _ lattice path_.    define a _ balanced sequence _ ( _ b - sequence _ ) to be a finite sequence of steps @xmath94 such that the number of steps starting at height  @xmath91 is equal to the number of steps ending at height  @xmath91 , for all  @xmath91 .",

    "( _ o - sequence _ ) to be a b - sequence where the steps starting at smaller height always precede steps starting at larger heights .",
    "in other words , an o - sequence of type @xmath17 is a sequence of @xmath96 steps starting at height  @xmath51 , then @xmath97 steps starting at height  @xmath98 , etc .",

    "we will call this a _",
    "path sequence _ ( _ p - sequence _ ) .",

    "first , observe that choosing a term of @xmath112 means choosing a term @xmath113 @xmath96 times , then choosing a term @xmath114 @xmath97 times , etc .",
    ", and then multiplying all these terms .",
    "in other words , each term on the left - hand side of   corresponds to an o - sequence in @xmath99 for a unique vector @xmath17 .",
    "similarly , by  , a term on the right - hand side of   corresponds to a p - sequence , i.e. to an element of @xmath109 for a unique vector @xmath17 .",
    "let us define a bijection @xmath115 with the property that the word @xmath116 is a rearrangement of the word  @xmath117 , for every o - sequence @xmath117 .",
    "take an o - sequence @xmath117 , and let @xmath118 $ ] be the maximal interval on which it is part of a p - sequence , i.e. the maximal interval @xmath118 $ ] on which the o - sequence has the property that if a step ends at level @xmath91 , and the following step starts at level @xmath119 , the o - sequence stays on or above height @xmath92 afterwards .",
    "let  @xmath91 be the height at  @xmath90 .",
    "choose the step @xmath120 in the o - sequence that is the first to the right of @xmath90 that starts at level @xmath91 ( such a step exists because an o - sequence is a balanced sequence ) .",

    "the new object is part of a p - sequence at least on the interval @xmath122 $ ] . continuing this procedure",
    "we get a p - sequence @xmath116 .",
    "for example , for the o - sequence given in figure  1 we have @xmath123 and  @xmath124 . the step we choose then is @xmath125 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath126 .    [ l : vp ] the map  @xmath127 constructed above is a bijection .",
    "since the above procedure never switches two steps that begin at the same height , there is exactly one o - sequence that maps into a given b - sequence : take all steps starting at height @xmath51 in the b - sequence in the order they appear , then all the steps starting at height @xmath98 in the p - sequence in the order they appear , etc .",
    "clearly , this map preserves the type of a b - sequence .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the switches for an o - sequence of type @xmath128 , and the p - sequence in figure  [ fig1 ] is the result of applying this procedure to the o - sequence in the same figure ( we need @xmath129 switches ) .",
    "in summary , lemma  [ l : vp ] establishes the desired bijection between two sides of equation  .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "although we already established the macmahon master theorem , in the next two subsections we will refine and then elaborate on the proof .",
    "this will be useful when we consider various generalizations and modifications of the theorem .",
    "first , let us define _ q - sequences _ to be the b - sequences we get in the transformation of an o - sequence into a p - sequence with the above procedure ( including the o - sequence and the p - sequence ) .",
    "examples of q - sequences can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] , where an o - sequence is transformed into a p - sequence via the intermediate q - sequences .",
    "formally , a q - sequence is a b - sequence with the following properties : it is part of a p - sequence on some interval @xmath118 $ ] ( and this part ends at some height  @xmath91 ) ; the rest of the sequence has non - decreasing starting heights , with the exception of the first step to the right of  @xmath90 that starts at height  @xmath91 , which can come before some steps starting at lower levels",
    ". for a q - sequence  @xmath117 , denote by @xmath130 the q - sequence we get by performing the switch defined above ; for a p - sequence @xmath117 ( where no more switches are needed ) , @xmath131 . by construction ,",
    "map  @xmath132 always switches steps that start on different heights .    for a balanced sequence ,",
    "define the _ rank _  @xmath133 as follows : @xmath134 clearly , o - sequences are exactly the balanced sequences of rank  0 .",
    "note also that the map  @xmath132 defined above increases by  @xmath51 the rank of sequences that are not p - sequences .",
    "write @xmath135 for the union of two sets of b - sequences of type @xmath17 : the set of all q - sequences with rank @xmath136 and the set of p - sequences with rank @xmath137 ; in particular , @xmath138 and @xmath139 for @xmath140 large enough ( say , @xmath141 will work ) .",
    "the map @xmath142 is a bijection for all  @xmath136 .",
    "a q - sequence of rank @xmath136 which is not a p - sequence is mapped into a q - sequence of rank @xmath143 , and @xmath132 is the identity map on p - sequences .",
    "this proves that @xmath132 is indeed a map from @xmath135 to @xmath144 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath132 is injective and surjective .",
    "the lemma gives another proof that @xmath145 is a bijection .",
    "this is the crucial observation which will be used repeatedly in the later sections .",
    "let us emphasize the importance of bijections  @xmath132 and  @xmath146 in the language of ideals .",
    "obviously we have @xmath131 modulo @xmath58 for every q - sequence @xmath117 .",
    "consequently , @xmath147 modulo @xmath58 for every o - sequence , and we have @xmath148 where the sum is over all o - sequences  @xmath149 . from above , this can be viewed as a restatement of the macmahon master theorem  [ macm1 ] .",
    "the proof we presented above splits into two ( unequal ) parts : combinatorial and linear algebraic .",
    "the combinatorial part ( the construction of the bijection  @xmath146 ) is the heart of the proof and will give analogues of   in non - commutative cases as well . while it is fair to view the equation   as the `` right '' generalization of the master theorem",
    ", it is preferable if the right - hand side is the inverse of some version of the determinant , for both aesthetic and traditional reasons .",
    "this is also how our main theorem  [ t : main ] is stated .    the linear algebraic part , essentially the equation  , is trivial in the commutative ( classical ) case .",
    "the non - commutative analogues we consider are much less trivial , but largely known .",
    "in the most general case considered in the main theorem the formula follows easily from the results of manin on quantum determinants  @xcite and advanced technical results of etingof and retakh who proved   for quantum determinants  @xcite in a more general setting ( see further details in section  [ s : final ] ) .    to avoid referring the technicalities to other people s work and deriving these basic linear algebra facts from much more general results ,",

    ", one may assume that the choice of a @xmath422-analogue was a lucky guess or a carefully chosen deformation designed to make the technical lemmas work .",
    "this was not our motivation , of course .",
    "these quadratic algebras are well known generalizations of the classical quantum groups of type  @xmath348 ( see  @xcite ) . they were introduced and extensively studied by manin , who also proved their koszulity and defined the corresponding ( generalized ) quantum determinants .    while our proof is combinatorial , we are confident that the hai - lorenz approach will work in the @xmath422-case as well .",
    "while we do not plan to further investigate this connection , we hope the reader find it of interest to pursue that direction .      for matrices over general rings ,",
    "the elements of the inverse matrices are called _ quasi - determinants _",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "they were introduced by gelfand and retakh , who showed that in various special cases these quasi - determinants are the ratios of two ( generalized ) determinants . in particular , in the context of non - commutative determinants they established propositions  [ cf3 ] , [ q6 ] and a ( slightly weaker ) corresponding result for the super - analogue .    in a more general context , etingof and",
    "retakh showed the analogue of this result for all twisted quantum groups  @xcite .",
    "although they do not explicitly say so , we believe one can probably deduce our most general proposition  [ qij7 ] from  @xcite and the above mentioned manin s papers .",
    "interestingly , it follows from  @xcite and our work that the ( non - commutative ) determinants of minors considered in this paper always commute with each other .",
    "we do not need this observation for our telescoping argument .",
    "the relations for variables in our super - analogue are somewhat different from those studied in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "note also that our super - determinant is different from the _ berezinian _",
    "@xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we are somewhat puzzled by this and hope to obtain the `` real '' super - analogue in the future .",
    "the relations studied in this paper always lead to quadratic algebras .",
    "while the deep reason lies in the koszul duality , the fact that koszulity can be extended to non - quadratic algebras is suggestive  @xcite .",
    "the first such effort is made in  @xcite where an unusual algebraic extension of macmahon master theorem is obtained .      while we do not state the most general result combining both @xmath0-extension and @xmath422-analogue , both the statement and the proof follow verbatim the presentation in section  [ beta ] .",
    "similarly , the results easily extend to all complex values  @xmath424 .",
    "let us mention here that the original @xmath0-extension of the master theorem ( given in  @xcite ) follows easily from the @xmath0-extension of the lagrange inversion  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the proof of the latter is bijective .      in the previous papers  @xcite the authors used @xmath425 and @xmath426 notation for the left- and the right - hand side of  . while the implied connection is not unjustified , it might be misleading when the results are generalized .",
    "indeed , in view of koszul duality connection ( see subsection  [ ss : final - koszul ] above ) the algebras can be interchanged , while giving the same result with notions of _ bozon _ and _ fermion _ summations switched .",
    "on the other hand , we should point out that in the most interesting cases the _ fermion _ summation is finite , which makes it special from combinatorial point of view .",
    "the krattenthaler - schlosser s @xmath1-analogue ( theorem  [ t : ks ] ) is essentially a byproduct of the author s work on @xmath1-series .",
    "it was pointed out to us by michael schlosser that the cartier - foata matrices routinely appear in the context of `` matrix inversions '' for @xmath1-series ( see  @xcite )",
    ". it would be interesting to see if our extensions ( such as cartier - foata @xmath36-case in section  [ cfqij ] ) can can be used to obtain new results , or give new proofs of existing results .",
    "we are grateful to alexander polishchuk , vic reiner , vladimir retakh , michael schlosser , richard stanley and doron zeilberger for the interesting discussions and help with the references .",
    "we are especially thankful to pavel etingof and christian krattenthaler for helping us understand the nature of theorem  [ t : ks ] .",
