    "we investigate the possible cosmological effects of neutrino mixing .",
    "the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis has been proposed since long time as a probe for particle physics @xcite , but the systematic uncertainties in the measurements of nuclear abundances represent an obstacle for improvements . in the last two years different experiments confirmed the existence of acoustic peaks in the power spectrum of cmb temperature anisotropies @xcite , from which it has been possible to measure , with improved precision , many different cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the precision of these measurements will be further improved by the new satellite experiments : the map satellite , already launched and on the way to its final orbit about the l2 lagrangian point @xcite and the planck satellite whose launch is scheduled in the year 2007 @xcite .",
    "these new observations represent a way to integrate the nuclear abundances observations partly overcoming the obstacle of systematic uncertainties and thus offering new opportunities to detect or constraint new physics in the early universe , in particular the effects of neutrino mixing .    in the section",
    "ii we describe a simple new analytic and graphical procedure to confront a large class of possible non standard effects with the cosmological observations .",
    "we consider both the present situation , finding that the total effective number of neutrino species @xmath2 , but we also point out which results from future observations could be interpreted as signatures of non standard effects . in sections",
    "iii - iv - iv we examine the specific predictions of those neutrino mixing models that have been proposed to explain the current data , including or excluding the lsnd experiment and , with the new procedure , we confront them with the cosmological observations .",
    "we explain why the early universe encounters difficulties in detecting effects from three ordinary neutrino mixing models ( section iii ) , while it is emphasized the unique capability of the early universe to probe a mixing with a new sterile neutrino sector even for very small mixing angles , otherwise out of the reach of earth experiments ( section iv ) . in the case of four neutrino mixing models ( section v )",
    "we study the cosmological predictions using the results obtained in the simple active - sterile neutrino mixing and neglecting the possible presence of phases .",
    "we find the remarkable results that the new data from the sno and sk experiments favour those four neutrino mixing models , both of ` 2 + 2 ' and ` 3 + 1 type ' , that lead to a final @xmath1 . in section",
    "vi we show how an additional sterile neutrino flavor could solve the disagreement with the cosmological bound if its mixing is able to generate a large electron neutrino asymmetry generation that produces a negative contribution to @xmath3 . in section vii",
    "we conclude summarizing which are the possible signatures of neutrino mixing models that should be searched in future observation .",
    "the recent observations of cmb anisotropies @xcite provide a useful consistency test for the other cosmological observations .",
    "the interpretation of data depends on theoretical assumptions . therefore , it is important that the simplest model used to fit the data , that makes use of 7 independent parameters , gives results that are consistent with the other observations .",
    "a combined analysis of the experiments allowing also for the presence of tensor fluctuations and a hot dark matter component by increasing the number of parameters to 11 @xcite , does not show hints of the presence of such components and is remarkable that , when information from galaxy clustering is added , an upper bound of @xmath4 ev on the sum of neutrino masses is found .",
    "although these analysis support a cosmological consistency , one has to be aware that maybe we are excluding important possible effects that are still compatible with the data or that maybe some cosmological observations are affected by systematic uncertainties and are misleading us to wrong conclusions and to exclude important pieces of the picture .",

    ", @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this result practically coincides with ( [ omega ] ) , even though different assumptions have been used .",
    "therefore this seems quite a stable and reasonable value to be used for our analysis .",
    "the standard bbn model ( sbbn ) assumes the particle physics content of the standard model of particle physics ( in particular zero masses and no mixing for neutrinos ) .",
    "moreover it assumes that the neutrino distributions are described by the fermi - dirac ones with zero chemical potentials and with a temperature @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the predicted primordial nuclear abundances are functions of the only parameter @xmath13 , the baryon to photon ratio , related to @xmath14 by the simple relation @xmath15 .",
    "the value ( [ omega ] ) for @xmath16 corresponds to have : in units of @xmath17 , omitting the subscript ` @xmath18 ' to simplify the notation . ]",
    "@xmath19 these predictions have to be compared with the measured values .",

    "we however prefer to continue to distinguish the two different measurements .",
    "the primordial deuterium abundance is measured in quasars absorption systems at high redshift .",
    "this kind of measurements gives the result @xcite : @xmath22 we will not consider measurements of the primordial lithium abundance since it is not fully understood whether we are really able to estimate how stellar processes could have modified it to the present .",
    "a test for the sbbn means to check whether the following conditions are fullfilled : @xmath23 @xmath24 the functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 do not have exact analytical expression but fits around @xmath27 give the results @xcite : annihilations as a non standard effect ( see discussion later on ) and thus we are subtracting this contribution ( @xmath28 @xcite ) from the result found in @xcite : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the neutron life - time . ]",
    "@xmath31 @xmath32 using the cmb value ( [ eta ] ) for @xmath13 , one finds that the sbbn predicts : @xmath33 @xmath34 if we compare these values with the experimental measurements we see that the sbbn is in agreement with the observations if high values of @xmath35 are used , otherwise for low values of @xmath35 there is a @xmath36 discrepancy .",
    "such a comparison of sbbn with the observations can be also done saying that sbbn predicts , from the current @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the following values for @xmath13 ( 3@xmath39 ) : @xmath40 and comparing them with @xmath41 the same previous conclusions follow .",
    "we want now to quantify the possibility that bbn is non standard and of course , in doing this , we will be particularly interested in those non standard bbn models that can result from neutrino mixing . in this case the possible non standard effects are of two kinds and quite well known .",
    "the _ first effect _ is the possibility that the number of energy density degrees of freedom @xmath42 differs from its sbbn value @xmath43 before or during the bbn period . in this way",
    "the expansion rate and the standard bbn predictions for the primordial nuclear abundances would be modified @xcite .",
    "the change of @xmath44 can be expressed in terms of the ( effective ) extra number of neutrino species @xcite @xmath45 : @xmath46 from the definition of @xmath44 it follows that @xmath47 is related to the neutrino energy densities by the following simple expression : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the ` x'-particles include the three ordinary neutrinos plus possible new species ( we will be interested to possible new sterile neutrino flavors ) .",
    "again we can make use of linear fits that account for the contribution of a non zero @xmath45 in the bbn predictions for the primordial nuclear abundances : . while the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath47 can be easily calculated considering that this abundance stays constant for @xmath51 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath52 @xmath53 a _ second class of deviations from sbbn _ are those related to distortions of electron neutrino and anti - neutrino sbbn distributions , given by the fermi - dirac distribution with zero chemical potential ( the same for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ) . in general deviations",
    "can not be described in terms of a finite number set of parameters but by an infinite number of parameters ( the occupation numbers for each quantum state with a given momentum ) .",
    "however one can first calculate the change in @xmath35 caused by these deviations and then normalize this change by introducing the quantity : @xmath54\\over 0.0137}\\ ] ] in this way one weighs the effect of distortions in terms of the presence of extra number neutrino species . a specific model of non standard",
    "bbn should be able to specify the deviations @xmath55 at each momentum and during all the period of bbn .",
    "however it has to be remarked that once that the neutron to proton ratio has frozen , the electron neutrino ditributions do not have any more a direct role in the nuclear reactions . thus everything will depend only on the frozen value of @xmath56 and still on @xmath45 .",
    "this means that the deuterium abundance will depend only indirectly on the electron neutrino distortions through the quantity @xmath57 .",
    "actually such a dependence is very weak and we will neglect it .",
    "of course different @xmath58 can produce the same @xmath57 and this degeneracy represents a lost of information .",
    "would be to detect the electron relic neutrino distributions from which one could infer their values during bbn .",
    "unfortunately relic neutrinos detection appears at the moment beyond the current observations but there are some interesting developments from the study of uhe@xmath59 scattering on relic neutrinos and producing z bursts @xcite . ] the predictions of such non standard bbn models can again be compared with the experimental observations : @xmath60 @xmath61 the @xmath35 measurement puts constraint on the quantity : would assume a more general interpretation and depend also on other non standard parameters like the size of inhomogenenities and thus should be more generally indicated for example with @xmath62 .",
    "in this paper we are interested to focus on non standard effects from neutrino mixing models and thus we completely neglect the possibility for these kinds of inhomogeneities but it is interesting that this procedure could be employed also in a different context . ]",
    "@xmath63 at @xmath64 , assuming high values for @xmath37 , we find : @xmath65 while assuming low values we find : @xmath66 the deuterium abundance provides a complementary information on @xmath47 and the comparison between the prediction and the observed value gives , conservatively at a 3@xmath39 level , an upper bound on @xmath47 : @xmath67 while a lower bound is still not obtained with the current precision of measurements .",
    "the constraints ( [ ntoth ] ) , ( [ ntotl ] ) and ( [ nrho ] ) are shown in * figure 1 * , in a plot @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to see how one can expect that these constraints will improve from future cmb measurements of @xmath13 .",
    "the planck experiment should be able to measure @xmath13 with a precision at the level of 1% or less @xcite . in this way",
    "the uncertainties on the theoretical predictions of the nuclear abundances , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , will become negligible compared to the errors on the experimental values .",
    "assuming that the future measured value @xmath41 will correspond to the current central value of @xmath50 in sbbn , @xmath71 ( see eq.([etad ] ) ) , then the current deuterium observations will constraint @xmath45 to be @xmath72 ( @xmath64 ) ( the horizontal thick dashed line in figure 1 ) while still one does not get a lower bound .",
    "that is not particularly meaningful . at @xmath73 one",
    "gets @xmath74 , that implies the presence of at least one standard neutrino species .",
    "note that a model in which a @xmath75 neutrino was decaying prior the onset of bbn was proposed to solve the bbn crisis from low @xmath76 values @xcite . in such a case one can get negative values of @xmath45 as low as @xmath77 .",
    "nowaday such a model is very disfavored by the neutrino oscillations experiments but nevertheless it gives an example of why it is not meaningless to put a negative lower bound on @xmath45 , that moreover can be considered a sort of consistency check of the basic bbn assumptions .",
    "] the same exercise can be performed with @xmath35 to see how the constraints on @xmath3 would improve and the result is shown with vertical dashed lines in * figure 1*. this time the improvement is slight because the @xmath35 abundance is much less sensitive to @xmath13 than @xmath50 and the error on @xmath3 is dominated by the error on @xmath37 .",
    "the two constraints together , from @xmath50 and @xmath35 , give the gray region in * figure 1 * with thick dashed line contours .",
    "differently it could happen that future cmb observations will indicate @xmath78 ( see eq .",

    "will be the direct measurement of @xmath47 .",
    "the presence of an extra radiative component changes the cmb spectrum , in particular leading to the enhancement of the height of first acoustic peak . at the present",

    "* we indicated with horizontal thin dashed lines a realistic future constraint @xmath92 .",
    "it has to be said that the cmb observations will measure @xmath45 around the time of recombination and thus it could be in principle different from the value of @xmath45 during the earlier period of bbn if some intervening effect modified it . for example",
    "@xmath93 can be higher of @xmath94 in the case of massive neutrino decays . in this case a comparison between the two quantities will test the ` relativity parameter ' @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "their comparison could give also another result : @xmath96 .",
    "this is possible only if one can say that @xmath97 . if one looks at the expressions ( [ dsbbn ] ) and ( [ etad ] ) , such a conclusion is possible if future @xmath80 error observations will give @xmath87 .",
    "for example from @xmath98 one can deduce @xmath99 , while it can happen at the same time that cmb constraints @xmath100 .",
    "this paradoxical situation could occur if @xmath3 is inhomogenous .",
    "we neglected a dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath3 , that means on @xmath35 or , equivalently , on the frozen value of neutron to proton ratio .",
    "this because the @xmath35 observations suggest that @xmath35 can not differ from the sbbn value so much to modify @xmath50 in a sensible way , while the value of @xmath45 is much less constrained and it can considerably alter the value of @xmath50 .",
    "however the observations measure @xmath35 only within about @xmath101 around us , while the @xmath50 abundance is measured in the quasars absorption systems at much larger distances . thus it can not be excluded that @xmath35 can be ` there ' much larger than what we observe around us @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of cmb anisotropies exclude the possibility that this spatial variation can be due to a inhomogenous @xmath45 , and thus it can be due only to a inhomogeneous @xmath102 that should be ` there ' much larger ( and positive ) than around us . in this case",
    "the @xmath50 nuclear abundance can be higher than what predicted by sbbn and compatible with @xmath103 .",
    "such a possibility should be however accompanied by the observation of dispersion in the @xmath50 measurements in the range of values @xmath104 .",
    "note that at the moment values of @xmath87 are already excluded at @xmath105 and thus a small improvement in the measurement precision of @xmath41 should be able to disfavour ( or reveal ! ) such a situation .",
    "however only constraining the dispersion in the values of measured @xmath50 can put more general limits on the presence of inhomogeneities in @xmath57 .",
    "another important possibility is whether future observations will indicate @xmath106 , because then , in order not to violate the bound @xmath2 , one can conclude that there is a negative contribution @xmath57 .",
    "the sbbn corresponds , in the plane @xmath68 , to the origin .",
    "one can consider the correction to the approximation of full neutrino decoupling at the time of electron - positron annihilations ( implying @xmath12 ) .",

    "this would represent an important confirmation of the early universe standard scenario below @xmath110 .    a particular subclass of non standard bbn models , of the type considered here ,",

    "this allows to get more restrictive constraints but in a more specific context and at the expenses of physical insight . in our procedure",
    "we get more conservative constraints becasue of the poorest statistical procedure . on the other hand we gain more physical insight from an analytical procedure valid in a more general framework in which we distinguish @xmath45 in bbn and cmb , the role of @xmath57",
    "is emphasized as we need for our purposes , and we find a bound on @xmath3 missing in @xcite .",
    "all these features are important for our following considerations .",
    "with the exclusion of the lsnd experiment , usually justified with the argument that it is the only experiment not yet confirmed by a second one , a three ordinary neutrino mixing can explain the current data from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments .",

    "however the neutrino heating effect is small like also the difference between the muon / tauon and the electron neutrino populations . thus the bimaximal mixing would represent a correction of an already correcting effect .",

    "an explanation in terms of neutrino mixing of the solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , together with the lsnd experiment , implies three different scales of mass squared differences : @xmath136 .",
    "this requires the existence of at least one new neutrino flavor @xcite that has to be sterile in order to escape the constraint @xmath137 from the invisible decay width of the z - boson @xcite .",
    "a two neutrino mixing between one ordinary neutrino flavor @xmath138 and one sterile neutrino flavor @xmath139 is the simplest case of mixing involving new sterile neutrino flavors . with the new data from the atmospheric and the solar neutrino experiments",
    ", such a simple scheme seems to be excluded , as the three ordinary neutrino flavors appear to be mixed among themselves .",
    "however the solutions of the kinetic equations , necessary to calculate @xmath45 and @xmath3 , present many difficulties and this basic case represents an important starting point .",
    "moreover it can represent a limit case for some of the possible sub - mixings within a realistic multiflavor mixing , as we will see in the next section .",

    "we define the asymmetry of a lepton ( baryon ) particle species @xmath146 as : @xmath147 with @xmath148 being the particle number per comoving volume and @xmath149 is the number of photons per comoving volume at an initial temperature @xmath150 .",

    "a comparison with the results of @xcite , at @xmath177 , is not possible because these take into account also the negative contribution @xmath178 to @xmath45 and are performed in a quantum kinetic formalism that accounts also for the msw effect . ] for @xmath177 , while in @xcite it is claimed that @xmath45 is approximately three times lower .",
    "all these results have been obtained assuming small neutrino asymmetries .",
    "however in the resonant case , at small mixing angles , even if one starts with small neutrino asymmetries , a large @xmath151-neutrino asymmetry is generated around the critical temperature : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the critical ( re - scaled ) momentum @xcite .",
    "the growth is first driven by the neutrino collisions that suppress the msw effect .",
    "when the asymmetry reaches a value for which the interaction length at the resonance is larger than the resonance width , then the growth starts to be driven by the msw effect @xcite that can bring the @xmath138-asymmetry up to a maximum value of @xmath181 .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the msw effect is adiabatic for @xmath182 @xcite .",
    "below this value the msw effect becomes non adiabatic and ordinary neutrinos are not converted efficiently into sterile neutrinos anymore .",
    "however such a small value of the vacuum mixing angle represents by far the best example of how matter effects can enhance the mixing in vacuum , considering that in the sun enterior the msw effect occurs for @xmath183 @xcite .",
    "one would also like to know which is the upper limit on the vacuum mixing angle for the neutrino asymmetry to be generated .",
    "this is a point that has still not been investigated in the literature but we will see , in the next section , that it will prove to be very important for our considerations . fortunately it is possible to get an analytic estimation",
    ". we will be particularly interested to values of @xmath184 . for these values one can use the eq .",
    "( [ g- ] ) to calculate the sterile neutrino production @xmath185 . when the sterile neutrino production is negligible ( @xmath186 ) the value of the critical momentum is approximately given by the peak of fermi - dirac distribution : @xmath187 @xcite .",
    "once that the asymmetry generation has started the sterile neutrino production is suppressed in the collision dominated regime .",
    "this has the effect that the sterile neutrino production calculated by the eq .",
    "( [ nrhos ] ) is halved .",
    "thus , taking into account this effect , one can easily calculate that the condition @xmath188 corresponds to mixing angles @xmath189 .",
    "when this condition is verified , together with the lower limit from the adiabaticity , the final value of the neutrino asymmetry is very close to the impassable limit corresponding to a situation in which , for an initial positive ( negative ) value of @xmath190 , all anti - neutrinos ( neutrinos ) are converted into anti - sterile ( sterile ) neutrinos and thus @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "therefore the maximum value is also independent on the mixing angle in this range of values .",
    "when the sterile neutrino production becomes not negligible ( @xmath192 ) , it has the effect to delay the asymmetry generation since the value of @xmath180 increases and therefore @xmath193 decreases .",
    "when @xmath180 becomes higher than @xmath194 the asymmetry generation at the critical temperature is driven by resonant neutrinos well in the tail of the distribution .",
    "thus it is reasonable to think that when this happens the asymmetry generation mechanism will start to turn off .",
    "unfortunately it is not easy to give an analytic description of this effect .",
    "however there is a much simpler reason for which the final value of the neutrino asymmetry has to decrease when the sterile neutrino production becomes not negligible .",
    "the reason is that the final value is reached during the msw dominated regime that starts when the asymmetry has become large enough , during the collision dominated regime , that the neutrino and anti - neutrino resonances get completely separated and only anti - neutrino resonance can give a relevant effect , while the neutrino resonance is by far in the tail of the distribution if @xmath190 is initially positive , vice - versa if it is negative . in this way the msw effect enhances the asymmetry to its maximum value @xcite .",
    "however if sterile neutrinos have been produced during the previous collision dominated regime , not only ordinary anti - neutrinos will be converted into sterile anti - neutrinos , but also the already produced sterile anti - neutrinos will be converted back into ordinary anti - neutrinos .",
    "thus the maximum value of the final neutrino asymmetry becomes : , is given just by the equilibrium distribution times a coefficient @xmath195 in a way that @xmath196 . ]",
    "@xmath197 , corresponding to a final neutrino asymmetry _ at least _",
    "one order of magnitude less than its maximum value 3/8 .",
    "it is easy to calculate this value : @xmath198    let us discuss now the effects of a large neutrino asymmetry . the neutrino asymmetry generation yields two corrections to the @xmath185 calculated , in the resonant case , from the eq .",
    "( [ nrhos ] ) .",
    "a first correction is due to the effect , just described , of suppression of the sterile neutrino production after the generation of the asymmetry and can be described by a corrective factor to the eq .",
    "( [ nrhos ] ) that can be as low as @xmath199 , for @xmath186 and that becomes quickly @xmath145 ( no suppression ) for @xmath200 @xcite .",
    "a second effect takes into account the sterile neutrino production in the msw dominated regime that results as an additive contribution to @xmath185 from the eq .",
    "( [ nrhos ] ) that accounts only for the sterile neutrino production in the collision dominated regime . in the calculation of @xmath47 one has to take into account also the depletion of ordinary neutrinos .",
    "for @xmath201 the contribution to the sterile neutrino production from the msw dominated regime occurs below the neutrino chemical decoupling and is compensated by an opposite ordinary neutrino depletion and thus there is no contribution to @xmath47 . for higher values of @xmath202 ordinary neutrino",
    "are re - populated by the annihilations and this second contribution to @xmath47 can be as high as @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "however values of @xmath204 are disfavoured by structure formation + cmb considerations ( see for example @xcite ) . in any case",
    "the sum of the two contributions to the total @xmath45 , from the two different regimes , can not be much higher than @xmath145 .",
    "thus the account of the neutrino asymmetry generation leads only to corrections to the calculation of @xmath45 .    in the case",
    "@xmath205 the contribution @xmath47 to @xmath3 is the leading effect at large mixing angles and @xmath206 due to a small depletion of @xmath207 number density induced by the much higher @xmath138 number density depletion @xcite . ] and we can approximately say that the accessible region in the plot @xmath68 lies along @xmath208 for @xmath209 ( see * figure 2 * ) .    in the case",
    "@xmath210 , a large @xmath57 can arise from two different processes .",
    "a first process is the @xmath211 number density depletion that this time is a direct and relevant effect occurring for @xmath212 and yields always a positive @xmath57 that can be even higher than 1 . and",
    "@xmath213 , the @xmath35 production is @xmath214 higher than in sbbn , corresponding to @xmath215 and implying @xmath57 at least as high as @xmath216 ( the value of @xmath45 is not separately shown ) . extrapolating to higher values of @xmath217 it seems also quite evident that much higher values of @xmath3 ( @xmath218 ? ) and of @xmath102 ( @xmath219 ? ) are possible .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of a very recent work @xcite in which it is found that @xmath220 , implying @xmath57 at least as high as @xmath221 .",
    "] the cosmological constraints are thus strongly strenghtened by the account of this effect @xcite and this can be seen in the plot @xmath68 considering that the region @xmath222 lies largely outside the cosmological allowed region ( see * figure 2 * ) .",
    "the second process is the generation of a large electron neutrino asymmetry in the resonant case and at small mixing angles .",
    "this time the sign is the same one of the initial @xmath223 that is observationally unknown and that could be predicted only within a full baryo - leptogenesys model and thus it can be both positive and negative .    for negative values",
    "it is remarkable that the region @xmath224 becomes accessible in the @xmath68 plot . in @xcite",
    "it has been calculated that @xmath57 can be as low as @xmath225 ( for @xmath226 ) and in * figure 2 * one can see that for values @xmath227 , there is compatibility with the region allowed by the low @xmath37 values .",
    "thus @xmath228 oscillations provide a viable mechanism to solve the claimed sbbn crisis @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility , shown in * figure 2 * , is that @xmath228 oscillations would be also able to reconcile possible future ( @xmath80 error ) values of @xmath229 , with the nuclear abundances observations .",
    "]    still another interesting effect could be the possibility to generate the electron neutrino asymmetry in a inhomogeneous way .",
    "this would require the presence of small baryon number inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "this effect could produce inhomogeneous nuclear abundances that could have two kind of indications as discussed in the previous section : indirectly if one finds @xmath230 and @xmath231 or , directly , if one finds a dispersion in the values of @xmath50 measured from quasar absorption systems .",
    "thus the generation of an electron neutrino asymmetry yields many interesting cosmological effects but , within a two neutrino mixing scenario , it appears as a special possibility , considering that it requires @xmath210 , negative @xmath161 and small mixing angles .",
    "however we saw that the generation takes place even for tiny values of the vacuum mixing angles and because of this , the early universe is the most sensitive way to probe small mixings with new sterile neutrino flavors .",
    "moreover when considering realistic multiflavour mixing scenarios the conditions for the occurrence of an electron neutrino asymmetry generation can be more naturally satisfied .",
    "four neutrino mixing models represent the minimal way to explain , in terms of neutrino oscillations , all three anomalies including the results of the lsnd experiment .",
    "these models are described by a @xmath232 unitary mixing matrix @xmath121 connecting the 4 mass eigenstates @xmath233 , with definite masses @xmath118 , to the 4 flavor eigenstates @xmath115 ( @xmath234 ) : @xmath235    there are different possible patterns for the mass spectra but all of them can be distinguished in two types @xcite . in a first type , the ` 3 + 1 ' models ,",
    "the mass eigenvalue @xmath236 is separated by the other three , @xmath118 , by the lsnd gap in a way that @xmath237 .",
    "this case is a minimal modification of a three neutrino mixing model , since the introduction of a fourth mass eigenstate , to incorporate the lsnd results , just perturbs the mixing among the other three explaining solar and atmospheric neutrino results .",
    "this means that the fourth eigenstate is almost coinciding with the sterile neutrino flavor ( @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 ) . in a second type of models , the ` 2 + 2 ' models ,",
    "the spectrum splits in two nearly degenerate pairs with @xmath241 , @xmath242 , separated by the much larger lsnd scale @xmath243 . in this case",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix is very different from the case of three neutrino mixing models .",
    "there is an ongoing debate on which of the two types can better describe the experimental data @xcite . the new data from atmospheric neutrino experiments plus the inclusion of tritium @xmath244 decay data corner ` 3 + 1 ' models in two only allowed regions , at @xmath245c.l .",
    ", around @xmath246 and @xmath247 @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the fact that both atmospheric @xcite and solar neutrino @xcite data disfavour pure active - sterile oscillations , suggests , for ` 2 + 2 ' models , that the @xmath207 s ( for solar ) and the @xmath129 s ( for atmospheric ) are converted into some admixture of both active and sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "thus from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments there is no evidence of the existence of sterile neutrinos and the simplest four neutrino mixing models , predicting pure active to sterile neutrino oscillations , are disfavoured .",
    "however there is not uncompatibility among the three experiments when the full range of possible four neutrino mixing models is considered .",
    "we will now study the cosmological effects of both ` 3 + 1 ' and ` 2 + 2 ' class of models .",
    "the ` 3 + 1 ' models can be distinguished in two classes , a and b , such that @xmath248 in a and @xmath249 in b. in the b case the three heavier mass eigenstates are almost degenerate with @xmath250 or @xmath251 according to which of the two allowed islands is considered .",
    "the heidelberg - moscow experiment on @xmath252 decay puts restrictions on the b class @xcite .",
    "we can make use of the results seen for @xmath253 to get some simple estimations on the cosmological output of the two different classes .",
    "_ class a. _ one has to consider the different possible ways of oscillations into the sterile neutrino flavor .",
    "the sterile neutrino flavor almost coincides with the fourth eigenstate but it is also slightly present in the other three eigenstates .",
    "the mixing between the three light eigenstates and the fourth eigenstate is set by @xmath254 and , since it is positive , there is no neutrino asymmetry generation .",
    "the mixing of the three active neutrinos with the sterile neutrino can be described by three different mixing angles , @xmath255 . for @xmath256",
    "there are limits from the cdhs and bugey experiment for which @xmath257 .",
    "for @xmath258 we can assume the same limit .",
    "thus from the mixing setted by @xmath243 and using the eq.s ( [ nrhos ] ) and ( [ g+ ] ) one can can see that there is a total thermalization ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "the lsnd experiment relates the two mixing angles in a way that @xmath260 .",
    "therefore , even in the case of minimum sterile neutrino production , when @xmath261 one has @xmath262 , very close to a complete thermalization .",
    "a mixing of the three active neutrinos with the sterile neutrino can be also driven by @xmath263 and @xmath242 , since the sterile neutrino is also slightly present in the three light eigenstates . now",
    "the sign of @xmath161 can be also negative and thus a neutrino asymmetry generation could occur in principle but the presence of a large sterile neutrino population , from the mixing set by @xmath243 , will largely decrease the final value of the asymmetry , at least of one order of magnitude ( see the eq .",
    "( [ finl ] ) ) . in any case",
    "such a generation of neutrino asymmetry occurs for @xmath264 and in this case the critical temperature would be lower than the freezing temperature of the neutron to proton ratio and would not affect bbn predictions in a way that @xmath265 is negligible .",
    "thus the only relevant cosmological effect is @xmath262    _ class b. _ in this case the mixing of the three quasi - degenerate heavier eigenstates with the fourth eigenstate has a negative @xmath266 .",
    "therefore the sterile neutrino production is of resonant type and from the eq .",

    "these can be also distinguished in two classes , a and b. in the a ( b ) class the two lightest mass eigenstates , with masses @xmath271 and @xmath272 , explain solar ( atmospheric ) neutrino data while the two heavier , with masses @xmath273 and @xmath236 , explain the atmospheric ( solar ) neutrino data @xcite .",
    "let us define simple limit cases in which the lightest and heaviest pair of mass eigenstates are made only of two flavor eigenstates , that means to consider a mixing matrix with two unmixed @xmath274 blocks .",

    "if some unknown mechanism created large neutrino asymmetries ( @xmath340 ) above @xmath341 ( the characteristic temperature for oscillations with @xmath342 ) , then the sterile neutrino production would be completely suppressed @xcite . in this case",

    "* we neglected completely the presence of phases in the four neutrino mixing matrix since we used the analogy with two neutrino mixing to calculate the cosmological output .",
    "the role of phases in cosmology has never been studied .",
    "a possibility could be that , when phases are taken into account , then the active - sterile neutrino mixing , even with large angles @xmath343 , can generate a large neutrino asymmetry that suppresses the sterile neutrino production , or in the case of an electron neutrino asymmetry , yields a negative @xmath57 .",
    "this possibility should be verified in a full 4 neutrino mixing kinetic theory .",
    "if one assumes the existence of a mixing with a second light sterile neutrino flavor @xmath344 then it is possible to evade the cosmological bound if the mixing generates a large neutrino asymmetry able to suppress the production of the first sterile neutrino and in the case of an electron neutrino asymmetry also to yield a large negative @xmath57 .",
    "this new mass eigenstate should be added to the four neutrino mixing solutions that explain the experiments and that we described in the previous section . for convenience",

    "thus the addition of a second sterile neutrino flavour to the a class ` 3 + 1 ' type models and to the ` 2 + 2 ' models that are close to the limit cases 2 and 3 can not help to evade the cosmological bound .    in the _ resonant case _ the generation of a neutrino asymmetry from the mixing with @xmath344 is not obstacled by the mixing with the lsnd neutrino .",
    "thus any @xmath151-neutrino asymmetry generation has the effect to suppress the sterile neutrino production .",

    "this is the only effect in the case of generation of a muon or tauon neutrino asymmetry and thus @xmath348 .",
    "this means that adding a second sterile neutrino flavor to the ` 2 + 2 ' models ` close ' to the limit case 1 ( those for @xmath349 ) improves the agreement with cosmology but still not within @xmath350 . in the case of an electron asymmetry generation one",
    "can have also a negative contribution from @xmath57 and the cosmological bound can be fully evaded .",
    "this means that the addition of a second sterile neutrino flavor makes possible to evade the cosmological bound only when it is added to four neutrino spectra of type ` 3 + 1 ' class b or ` 2 + 2 ' models close to the limit case 4 ( @xmath351 ) , in which the lsnd neutrino is present mainly in the light pair of mass eigenstates and an electron neutrino asymmetry can be generated .",

    "the recent measurement of the baryon content from cmb anisotropies improves remarkably the cosmological information on new physics .",
    "the present observations do not show evidences of the presence of non standard effects and constraints can be conveniently displayed in the @xmath68 plot .",

    "if ( @xmath358 then , from the bound @xmath0 , one can conclude that @xmath359 .",
    "if the point 2 is verified but @xmath360 , then this can be interpreted as a signature of inhomogenous @xmath57 .",
    "this should be confirmed by inhomogeneities in @xmath50 measurements that should be anyway searched independently on cmb observations .",
    "we have applied these cosmological tools to the search of non standard effects from neutrino mixing . in the case of three ordinary neutrino mixing it seems not possible to find relevant cosmological effects . when a mixing with new light sterile neutrino flavors is considered , like the lsnd experiment seems to suggest ,",
    "then the early universe becomes a powerful probe .",
    "we have shown how the sno and sk experiments favour those four neutrino mixing models for which the sterile neutrino flavor is brought into thermal equilibrium or very close to it , implying that @xmath309 .",
    "at the same time a mechanism of electron neutrino asymmetry generation can not be invoked to have a negative @xmath57 and thus in the end @xmath1 .",
    "the cosmological bound @xmath2 is already quite conservative and future cosmological observations will be compatible with @xmath1 only if they will measure a value for @xmath41 that should be approximately half than the value measured by current observations or , alternatively , a value of @xmath35 that should be about 0.01 higher .",
    "this of course would mean that present observations are affected by large systematic uncertainties or that statistical errors have been largely underestimated .",
    "if one excludes such a possibility then a way out could be the presence of large initial neutrino asymmetries suppressing the sterile neutrino production . in this case",
    "the cosmological information can still be used to constraint the values of the neutrino asymmetries .",
    "such a conclusion would have a quite remarkable impact on baryo - leptogenesis models .",
    "another possibility is that phases in the neutrino mixing matrix could play an important role in the derivation of cosmological output and thus should be taken into account .",
    "another intriguing possibility is to assume the existence of more than one sterile neutrino flavor .",
    "the new sterile neutrino flavor should be mixed with the electron neutrino flavor with the proper mixing parameters such that a relevant electron neutrino asymmetry is generated and both halves the sterile neutrino production and yields a negative @xmath57 .",
    "this is possible only if the electron neutrino flavor is mainly present in the heavy mass eigenstates with @xmath361 .",
    "therefore this scenario will be testable in future @xmath352 decay experiments and with the cosmological tools that we described .",
    "this investigation thus shows that light sterile neutrinos in cosmology are now more constrained than before , because the possibility of a neutrino asymmetry generation in four neutrino mixing models is disfavoured within the statistical significance of the results from the sno @xcite and the sk @xcite experiments .",
    "the result is that the sterile neutrino flavor , required by the lsnd experiment , gets fully thermalized .",
    "therefore the confirmation of the existence of light sterile neutrino flavors in next neutrino mixing experiments would be of great relevance for cosmology .",
