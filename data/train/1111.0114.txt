    "one of the major initial successes of qed was the successful explanation of the famous lamb shift in terms of the effect of vacuum polarization .",
    "for qcd the strange form factors of the nucleon occupy a position of comparable importance .",
    "while lattice qcd has accurately described a number of valence quark dominated hadronic properties , the strange form factors of the nucleon can only arise through quantum fluctuations in which a strange - anti - strange pair briefly bubble into and out of existence .",
    "it is now more than 20 years since it was realized that parity violating electron scattering ( pves ) could provide a third , independent constraint on the vector form factors of the nucleon , thus allowing one to solve for the strange vector matrix elements  @xcite . following a series of state - of - the - art measurements at mit - bates ,",
    "mainz and jlab ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , as well as systematic study of the relevant radiative corrections  @xcite and a careful global analysis  @xcite , we now know that the strange magnetic form factor is at most a few percent of the proton magnetic form factor at low-@xmath0 and the strange electric radius is also at most a few percent of the proton charge radius .",
    "the length of time since the initial studies of nucleon vector form factors in lattice qcd , by leinweber and collaborators , is also around 20 years . in combination with chiral extrapolation of lattice data using finite range regularisation , indirect techniques developed by leinweber and thomas",
    "@xcite led to a very precise determination of both the strange magntic moment of the proton and its strange charge radius  @xcite some 15 years later .",
    "although it initially seemed as though these calculations disagreed with the pves data , it is now clear that the agreement is excellent . furthermore , precise , direct calculations of these form factors from the kentucky group in just the last two years  @xcite agree very well with the results of the earlier indirect work and with the experimental results .",
    "at present , the accuracy of the theoretical calculations exceeds that of the best experiments by almost an order of magnitude  a remarkable exception in strong interaction physics .",
    "clearly the challenge is there for a clever new idea to take us beyond the current experimental limitations .",
    "nevertheless , this future challenge should not blind us to the tremendous achievements thus far and especially to the fact that qcd has passed its equivalent of the `` lamb shift test '' with flying colours .    in the next section we briefly review the state of play with respect to the strange sigma commutator ( the strange scalar form factor ) , for which the best value has taken a major shift in the last two or three years .",
    "we also point out the relevance to dark matter searches . in the third section we recall the recent surprises concerning the h - dibaryon and after recalling the best current estimate of its mass",
    "we explore some of the potential uncertainties .",
    "in many ways it is fortunate that we have not had sufficient computing power to directly calculate hadron properties at the physical quark masses . instead , we have been given data on a number of hadronic properties _ with qcd _ as a function of the masses of the quarks .",
    "this is of course information that nature can not give us but which is nevertheless an invaluable guide to how qcd actually works  @xcite . from those studies it is clear that for whatever reason ( and we suggest one below ) the properties of baryons and non - goldstone mesons made of light quarks behave exactly as one would expect in a constituent quark model once the pion mass is above about 0.4 gev .",
    "that is , all the famous , rapid , non - analytic variation associated with goldstone boson loops is seen to disappear in this region .",
    "there has been some speculation that this scale ( which corresponds to a quark mass around 40 mev ) may have something to do with the size of an instanton .",
    "however , it is clear that such behaviour does emerge maturally if one takes into account the finite size of such hadrons , which necessarily suppresses meson loops at large momentum transfer and at large mass for the goldstone bosons . put simply , meson loops are suppressed when the corresponding compton wavelength is smaller than the size of the hadron emitting or absorbing the meson . given that a typical hadron size is 1fm , and the compton wavelength of a meson of mass 0.4 gev only 0.5fm",
    ", one has a natural explanation .",
    "this qualitative lesson from qcd itself , leads us to anticipate that the contribution of strange quarks to nucleon properties should be suppressed , as the mass of the kaon is 0.5 gev  above the critical scale .",
    "this idea has also been developed to allow quantitative advances in the calculation of hadron properties using finite range regularization ( frr )  @xcite .",
    "this technique allows one to effectively resum the chiral expansion of hadronic properties and to accurately describe the variation of properties such as the mass of the baryon octet over a much larger range of quark masses than expected within naive chiral perturbation theory .    once one has an accurate parametrization of the mass of the nucleon as a function of pion and kaon mass , based on a fit to modern lattice data for the nucleon octet using frr , it is trivial to extract the light quark sigma commutators by differentiation , using the feynman - hellmann theorem .",
    "it is this approach which has recently established that @xmath1 is almost an order of magnitude smaller than had been generally believed for 20 years  @xcite .",
    "very similar conclusions have been reached by several other modern lattice simulations  @xcite , with everyone agreeing that the value is between 20 and 50 mev .",
    "although at first sight it is shocking that there can be such a large shift in a fundamental property of the nucleon , it is quite common with fundamental parameters that apparent convergence can be followed by a shift by far more than the quoted uncertainties when a new technique becomes available .    the importance of this new value for kaon condensation in dense matter remains to be investigated .",
    "it is in the search for dark matter that the new value of @xmath1 has had its immediate impact  @xcite . in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , constrained by all particle physics and wmap data , the so - called cmssm ,",
    "the favoured candidate for dark matter is the neutralino  @xcite , a weakly interacting fermion with mass of order of a hundred gev or more . with the old values of @xmath1 its dominant interaction with",
    "the nucleon was through the strange quark  which had led to ellis and collaborators calling desperately for a more accurate determination of the strange quark sigma commutator  @xcite .",
    "the new value reported above not only reduces the expected cross section by an order of magnitude compared with earlier optimistic expectations but it also makes them far more accurate .",
    "we refer to the work of giedt _ et al .",
    "_ for more details  @xcite .",
    "in this section we turn to the extremely exciting possibility that the @xmath2-dibaryon , which had been abandoned by many , may indeed be almost bound with respect to the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "this possibility was raised only in the last year by the nplqcd and hal collaborations  @xcite , which found the @xmath2 bound by tens of mev at the unphysically large light quark masses where they could perform the calculations .",
    "the issue then becomes whether one can accurately extrapolate these results to the physical quark masses .",
    "given our explanation of the effectiveness of frr and the relatively large quark masses at which much of the data was taken , this seems the natural technique to apply .",
    "it is helpful that the corresponding chiral coefficient for the @xmath2 , assuming that it is indeed a genuine multi - quark state and not a quasi - molecular state like the dueteron , were calculated in the early 80s by mulders and thomas  @xcite .    by making a simultaneous fit to the precise octet baryon masses",
    "noted earlier , as well to the data for the @xmath2 , shanahan _ et al . _",
    "were able to show that at the physical quark masses the @xmath2 is most likely slightly unbound : @xmath4 mev  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we explore , in more detail than was possible in the original article , the uncertainties in this result .",
    "these turn out to be rather small .",
    "we investigate the claim that varying the form of the regulator , @xmath5 , used with the frr formalism does not change the results obtained for the binding of the @xmath2-dibaryon . as well as the dipole form used for the primary fit ,",
    "we investigate monopole and exponential forms : @xmath6 a sharp cut - off was also tested",
    ". fits with each of these regulators yield @xmath7 values ( per degree of freedom ) between 0.48 and 0.49 , with the @xmath2 unbound at the physical point by @xmath8  mev ( monopole and exponential forms ) , or @xmath9  mev ( sharp cutoff ) .",
    "octet masses from each of these fits match the results obtained from the fit with a dipole regulator to within the quoted precision .",
    "best - fit parameter values for these fits are given in table  [ tab : varyreg ] .",
    "it is clear that the form of the regulator does not significantly effect the results , and the selection of a dipole form as regulator is justifiable .",

    ", we do find a significant variation in binding , with little associated variation in the quality of the fit .",
    "for @xmath19 @xmath20 smaller than @xmath21 , the @xmath2 is bound at the physical point by @xmath22  mev .",
    "note , however , that in this case the best - fit value of the chiral coefficient of the @xmath2 , called @xmath17 , grows to approximately 2.5 times the mulders - thomas estimate  @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "@xmath20 larger than @xmath21 , the @xmath2 is unbound by @xmath23  mev . in this case ,",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath17 in fact moves closer to the mulders - thomas estimate ; to within @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath7 per degree of freedom for these fits are 0.47 and 0.49 , respectively , a comparable quality of fit to the primary ( which had @xmath7/dof = 0.48 ) .",
    "best - fit values are shown in table  [ tab : ldiff ] . while naively one may expect that @xmath19 should be somewhat smaller than @xmath21 , corresponding to the expectation that the @xmath2 should be larger than the @xmath10 baryon in coordinate space , this is obscured by the regularisation scheme . as a different choice of @xmath10 corresponds to a difference in the resummation of higher - order terms in the formal chiral expansion , it is likely that the dominant sensitivity of the fit to a variation in @xmath10 will vanish , being compensated for by variations of the fit parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "for this reason , we suggest that , even though the inclusion of a mass parameter @xmath10 was motivated by the physical idea that loop processes with momenta greater than @xmath25 are suppressed , in the regularized frr formalism this parameter simply becomes a scale beyond which the effective theory is no longer valid .",

    "in particular , @xmath27 , the meson decay constant in the chiral limit , and the baryon - baryon - meson coupling constants , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , were set to values determined by chiral perturbation theory and su(6 ) symmetry .",
    "we test the robustness of the method by varying these parameters by @xmath30 , and noting that the dependence of the binding of the @xmath2 on these variations is small compared to the statistical error associated with our fit .",

    "there is little associated variation in the @xmath7 values for these fits , all lying between 0.44 and 0.5 ( compared to 0.48 for the primary fit ) .",

    "we have briefly reviewed the experimental and theoretical status of the strange vector form factors of the proton .",
    "their importance is that since they involve only `` disconnected diagrams '' the capacity of non - perturbative qcd to calculate them is comparable to that of the successful calculation of the lamb shift in qed . as we showed , qcd passes this test with flying colours .    with regard to the strange scalar form factor , there has been a dramatic downward shift in the past couple of years , with the contribution to the mass of the nucleon arising through the strange quark mass now around 3% , rather than 30% .",
