    "induced nucleosynthesis is also of relevance for abundances of isotopes lighter than iron ( especially for neutron ",
    "rich isotopes ) , even though the bulk of these elements has been synthesized by charged  particle induced reactions .",
    "there are three main sites for nucleosynthesis : ( i ) primordial nucleosynthesis forming the light elements h , he and li in the big bang , ( ii ) interstellar nucleosynthesis creating the elements li , be and b and finally ( iii ) stellar nucleosynthesis being responsible for the creation of all the elements from c to u. in these astrophysical scenarios neutron  induced reactions play a role in primordial nucleosynthesis in the early universe , in the s  process occurring in red giants , and in the @xmath0rich freeze  out ( @xmath0process ) and r  process thought to take place in supernovae of type ii . in the early universe",
    "the neutrons are formed through the hadronization of the quark  gluon plasma .",
    "however , these neutrons decay soon due to their mean lifetime of about 15 minutes . in red giants neutrons are formed in helium burning through the reactions @xmath1ne(@xmath0,n)@xmath2 mg and @xmath3c(@xmath0,n)@xmath4o .    the above astrophysical sites and their relevance for neutron  induced nucleosynthesis will be discussed in sect .  2 .",
    "the experimental methods and measurements at thermal ( @xmath5mev ) and thermonuclear energies ( @xmath6 1kev1mev ) are presented in sect .",
    "3 . in that section ,",
    "we focus on neutron radiative capture , even though ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions also play an important role in reaction networks up to @xmath7 . for the experimental detection of the reaction events mainly two signatures characterizing the capture process are discussed : detection of promptly emitted capture @xmath8radiation ( direct detection methods ) and the activity of the reaction product ( activation methods ) .    a survey of the theoretical methods used in calculating reaction cross sections and reaction rates and the underlying reaction mechanisms , i.e. , compound  nucleus ( cn ) formation and direct reaction ( di ) mechanism is given in sect .  4 .",
    "we discuss phenomenological methods ( r  matrix , breit  wigner formula ) and the statistical model ( hauser  feshbach ) that are used for calculations of the cn mechanism .",
    "the methods used for investigating reactions in the di are microscopic methods ( e.g. ,  resonating group method and generator coordinate method ) and potential models ( distorted wave born approximation , direct capture ) .",
    "especially , potential models will be discussed in some detail , because microscopic methods are limited to light nuclei and rarely reproduce simultaneously experimentally known quantities like separation energies , resonance energies and low  energy scattering data .    finally , some specific examples are given in sect .",
    "we start with a detailed investigation of the reaction @xmath9s(n,@xmath8)@xmath10s at thermonuclear and thermal energies , since for this reaction the di mechanism is dominating . for the di mechanism detailed nuclear ",
    "structure information is necessary to calculate cross sections .",
    "the comparison of the calculated capture cross sections of neutron  rich targets using different nuclear  structure inputs with the experimental data serves also as a benchmark for the calculation of neutron  capture using nuclear  structure models to still more neutron ",
    "rich isotopes off  stability . in the reaction @xmath11pb(n,@xmath8)@xmath12pb",
    "the resonant cn  contribution at thermal and thermonuclear energies is of the same order as the non  resonant di contribution . taking this into account excellent agreement with the experimental data",

    "finally , we investigate neutron  capture of gd  isotopes at thermonuclear energies as a specific example where only cn contributions are of relevance . for these reactions statistical hauser  feshbach calculations for the cross sections at thermonuclear energies",
    "are compared with recently measured experimental data .",
    "the paper is concluded by an appendix for the reader looking for more details , giving important formulas and definitions which were too specific to be included in the main body of the text .",
    "nucleosynthesis theory predicts that the formation of most of the nuclear species of mass with about @xmath13 occurs as a consequence of neutron  induced reactions .",
    "charged  particle thermonuclear reactions dominate the production of the heavy elements through approximately iron and nickel . beyond the iron group , however , neutron ",
    "capture processes are favored because of the increasing coulomb barriers which can only be overcome at such high temperatures , so that photodisintegration hinders the build  up of heavy nuclei via charged particle induced reactions . in the past years , a number of neutron ",
    "rich astrophysical environments have been suggested to explain the abundance pattern of heavy nuclei , in all of which neutron  induced reactions play an important role . among these",
    "are the suggested sites for the s and r  processes , but also more exotic scenarios such as primordial nucleosynthesis in inhomogeneous cosmologies . in this chapter",
    "we will briefly discuss the mentioned processes of nucleosynthesis , starting with the s and r  processes and their respective sites .",
    "additional information can be found also in the reviews of @xcite  , and @xcite  .    when examining the heavy  element abundances of solar system matter  @xcite one can find features correlated with the positions of the neutron shell closures at @xmath14 , 82 , and 126 .",
    "the splitting of those abundance peaks ( in the regions @xmath158090 , 130140 , 190210 ) suggests at least two scenarios with very distinct neutron fluxes .",
    "historically , this has led to the definition of two main nucleosynthesis processes , namely the s ( slow neutron capture ) and the r  process ( rapid neutron capture ) , which are thought to take place in quite different astrophysical environments .",
    "common to both is that some pre  existing distribution of seed abundances is exposed to neutron  irradiation , by which heavier elements are produced through subsequent neutron  captures and beta  decays .",
    "the distinction is made by comparison of the relative lifetimes for neutron captures ( @xmath16 ) and beta  decays ( @xmath17 ) . in the case of the s ",
    "process we find @xmath18 , for the r  process it is @xmath19 .",
    "( the definitions of the lifetime @xmath16 and the related astrophysical reaction rates can be found in appendix [ astroapp ] ) .    although the temperatures encountered in astrophysical environments are often of the order of billions of kelvin , the corresponding energies at which the nuclear cross sections have to be known are relatively low by nuclear physics standards . for neutron",
    " induced reactions one can derive a simple formula for the relevant energy range .",
    "the velocity distribution of the interacting particles follow the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at a given temperature .",
    "the dominant peak of that distribution ( i.e. , the ( by far ) most likely energy ) is found at @xmath20 .",
    "when using convenient units , this leads to @xmath21 , with @xmath22 measured in mev ( 1ev = @xmath23j ) and @xmath24 denoting the temperature in @xmath25k .",
    "the maximum temperatures in nucleosynthesis processes are @xmath26710 .",
    "thus , the energies are limited to the range of hundreds of kev and below .",
    "the condition @xmath18 ensures that the neutron ",
    "capture path will remain close to the valley of beta  stability . if an unstable nucleus is encountered in the neutron ",
    "capture chain , usually beta  decay to the next higher element is much faster than another neutron capture .",
    "therefore , the resulting abundances are determined by the respective neutron  capture cross sections .",
    "isotopes with small cross sections act as bottlenecks and build up large abundances .",
    "this leads to s ",
    "process peaks at magic neutron numbers , where the cross sections are particularly small .",
    "these bottleneck isotopes represent neutron exposure monitors determining the required mean s  process exposure .",
    "accurate neutron ",
    "capture cross sections are also needed to study the properties of the s ",
    "process branchings in the capture chain where the rates for capture and beta  decay are comparable . in these branchings very often a group of two , three or four radioactive isotopes is involved ( e.g. , @xmath27sm , @xmath28eu , and @xmath29gd ) .",
    "investigation of the abundance patterns in such branchings can yield a variety of important information , such as estimates of the neutron density , temperature , and electron density during the synthesis .",
    "it turned out that three different s ",
    "process components are necessary for a satisfactory description of the observed s ",
    "process abundances : the bulk of s  process material in the mass range @xmath30 is produced by what is called the _",
    "main _ s  process component , an s  process with an exposure distribution @xmath31 which is smoothly decreasing for increasing neutron exposures @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "especially an exponential exposure distribution is chosen which is considered to be the result of a pulsed neutron flux @xcite .",
    "a _ weak _ component  characterized by a smaller but continuous mean neutron exposure  is added to describe the abundances below @xmath33 .",
    "finally , a _",
    "strong _ component is to be postulated to account for the abundance maximum at lead . for more detailed reviews on the s ",
    "process see  @xcite  , and @xcite   and references therein .",
    "the analyses of s  processing with parametrized models  which can be basically undertaken independently of the true astrophysical sites and neutron sources  had proven to be quite successful .",
    "the s  process calculations can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in a recent development of the main component with a parametrized model using combined burning of two neutron sources ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ", new clues have been found to the pb ",
    "bi formation at the s ",
    ". one important outcome of these investigations is the empirical r  process abundance distribution obtained by subtraction of the calculated s  process abundances from the solar abundances ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the search for the astrophysical s  process site(s ) is still somewhat controversial  @xcite . as neutron sources , the most promising reactions are @xmath1ne(@xmath0,n)@xmath2 mg and @xmath3c(@xmath0,n)@xmath4o  @xcite .",
    "both reactions are typical of he  burning environments .",
    "large amounts of @xmath1ne can be expected to be built up at the very beginning of the he  burning phase .",
    "however , the @xmath1ne neutron source requires rather high temperatures ( @xmath34k ) to be activated . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath3c reaction can easily take place at lower temperatures ( radiative burning at @xmath35k , convective burning at @xmath36k ) but the sufficient supply of @xmath3c poses a problem . in current models both neutron sources",
    "are activated successively @xcite .",
    "a long series of research has been dedicated to the analyses of the he  burning phases in stars of different masses .",
    "it appears that the s ",
    "process components found in the classical model can be attributed to different sites .",
    "so it is now commonly believed that the weak component has to be ascribed to core he  burning in massive stars ( @xmath37 , 1 m@xmath38 = @xmath39 kg ) , but c and ne burning in the outer layers of the star ( `` shell burning '' ) may also be important .",
    "he  shell burning in intermediate and low mass stars ( @xmath40 ) could supply the conditions required for the main component  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the strong component is less understood but it was suggested that the core he  flash in stars of less than 11@xmath41 could be responsible for that contribution .",
    "but there is probably no need for a separate site if the distribution of exposures in the main component is not exactly exponential but is higher than exponential at large exposures @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "approximately half of all stable nuclei observed in nature in the heavy element region about @xmath13 is produced in the r  process .",
    "this r  process occurs in environments with large neutron densities which lead to @xmath42 .",
    "contrary to the s ",
    "process , the successive neutron captures will proceed into the region of neutron  rich nuclei far  off stability . for the large neutron fluxes characteristic of this process",
    ", the closed neutron shells are encountered in the neutron ",
    "rich regions and thus at lower proton numbers .",
    "therefore , the yield peaks are located at slightly lower mass number after the beta  decay of the products to stability , than in the s  process .",
    "in contrast to the beta  decay lifetimes of critical nuclei participating in the s  process in the range from about 10 to 100 years , the most neutron ",
    "rich isotopes along the r  process path have lifetimes of less than one second and more typically 10@xmath43 to 10@xmath44s .",
    "cross sections for most of the nuclei involved can not be experimentally measured anymore due to the short half  lives .",
    "therefore , theoretical descriptions of the capture cross sections as well as the beta  decay half  lives are the only source of the nuclear physics input for r  process calculations . for nuclei with about @xmath45 beta  delayed fission and neutron  induced fission might also become important .    for realistic",
    ", dynamic r  process calculations following temperatures and neutron densities changing rapidly with time ( such as in investigations of freeze  out effects ) , it proves necessary to use a complete reaction network with all relevant reaction and decay rates included .",
    "however , important information about the required r  process temperatures and densities can be derived from parameter studies using simplified models . at high neutron number densities ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) and high temperatures ( i.e. , large high  energy photon density , @xmath48k ) photodisintegrations will be active and balance the capture flow .",
    "decay lifetimes are usually longer than ( n,@xmath8) and ( @xmath8,n)time scales and thus each isotopic chain for any @xmath49 will be populated by an equilibrium abundance . in this case , the differential equations governing the reaction network can be simplified in such a way that the resulting abundance ratios are only dependent on the neutron density , temperature and the neutron separation energies  @xcite .",
    "this is the so  called _ waiting  point approximation _ because the nucleus with maximum abundance in each isotopic chain must wait for the longer beta  decay time scale .",
    "in such an ( n,@xmath8)@xmath50(@xmath8,n ) equilibrium , no detailed knowledge of neutron  capture cross sections is needed .",
    "another simplified approach is the _ steady  flow approximation_. again , the treatment of the full network can be facilitated by assuming an equal flux via beta",
    " decays into an isotopic chain with charge number @xmath49 and out of the chain @xmath49 into @xmath51  @xcite . after a time larger than the longest beta ",
    "decay half  lives , and if fission cycling ( see below ) is neglected , all the nuclei in the network will approach such steady  state abundances .",
    "this simplifies the solution of the equations because the assumption of an abundance at one @xmath49 is sufficient to predict the whole r ",
    "process curve .",
    "however , although steady  flow calculations correctly treat the neutron  capture rates and beta ",
    "decays of individual @xmath49chains , the effects of neutron captures and beta  decays on the dynamics of the r  process are ignored .",
    "depending on the time scales involved , this may or may not be a valid simplification .",
    "therefore , this method is useful when studying a number of different r  process conditions but it is not always comparable to a full dynamic network calculation .    in the quest for finding the site of the r ",
    "process , parameter studies employing the approximations described above yielded important information to put constraints on the required conditions .",
    "additionally , they could also show deficiencies in our knowledge of nuclear physics regarding theoretical mass models and thereby spur a series of investigations aimed at improving the nuclear physics input  @xcite . making use of ( n,@xmath8)@xmath50(@xmath8,n ) equilibrium",
    ", a recent analysis  @xcite of the solar system isotopic r  process abundance pattern revealed that it can only be reproduced with ( at least ) three components with different neutron densities ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) .",
    "this is necessary for correct positions of the three abundance peaks at @xmath52 , 130 , and 195 .",
    "these three components ( at time scales of about 1.52.0s ) also establish a steady flow for beta",
    " decays in between magic neutron numbers .",
    "the steady flow breaks down only at magic neutron numbers where the r  process path comes closest to stability and encounters the longest beta  decay half  lives . a local steady flow behavior had been proven with dominantly experimental mass and half  life knowledge at the magic neutron numbers n=50 and 82 for @xmath53co to @xmath54zn as well as @xmath55rh to @xmath56cd @xcite .",
    "here the path comes closest to stability and experiences increasingly long beta  decay half  lives , before the steady flow breaks down beyond the abundance peaks with the longest half  lives ( which must therefore be comparable with the process time itself ) .",
    "it is then obvious that a steady flow has to apply for the shorter half  lives in between closed shells .",
    "the propagation of an r  process will follow a contour line for a specific neutron separation energy @xmath57  @xcite . from deviations of the calculated",
    "compared to the observed abundances one can then draw conclusions on the validity of the nuclear theory used at a certain @xmath57",
    ".    concerns that this might be an overinterpretation have been raised since @xcite , and that an almost continuous superposition of a multitude of components would automatically be able to prevent the deviations from the solar abundance pattern attributed to deficiencies in nuclear mass models .",
    "however , it was shown that this is not possible @xcite and that therefore there is still an urgent need for improved nuclear theory in astrophysics .    despite many efforts ,",
    "the site of the r  process has not been clearly identified yet , although there are strong clues from recent studies and observations .",
    "the basic requirements for the r  process are neutron number densities @xmath58@xmath47 and temperatures around @xmath25k . in order to be able to synthesize the heaviest elements at @xmath59 one",
    "also needs a sufficient supply of neutrons ( 180 per seed nucleus , when starting at @xmath60 ) .",
    "an average over all isotopes produced gives a mean value of 80 neutrons per seed nucleus .",
    "thus , we arrive at another constraint for the abundance ratio of neutrons over seed nucleus of @xmath61 .",
    "the short time scale ( i.e. , seconds ) for neutron capture and the correspondingly large neutron fluxes required have for some time suggested an explosive astrophysical origin of the r  process .",
    "the currently most favored environment is the high  entropy bubble of an exploding type ii supernova .",
    "the iron core of a typically 825m@xmath38 star will collapse after si  burning when exceeding the chandrasekhar mass limit .",
    "the core will become stable again at nuclear density when the nucleon ",
    "gas becomes degenerate .",
    "the core will bounce back and a shockwave will run through the outer layers of the collapsed star",
    ". however , this shockwave does not carry enough energy to explode the star .",
    "the shock is heating the material to such high temperatures that the previously produced iron is photodisintegrated again .",
    "this process takes 47mev per nucleon ( 7mev for a complete photodisintegration into nucleons ) and will eventually halt the shockfront .",
    "the formation of the neutron star leads to a gain in gravitational binding energy which is released in the form of neutrinos .",
    "although the interaction of neutrinos with matter is quite weak , considerable amounts of energy can reheat the outer layers even if only 1% of the 10@xmath62erg ( 10@xmath63j ) in neutrinos is deposited via neutrino captures on neutrons and protons .",
    "this accelerates the shockwave again and can finally explode the star . because of the heating and expansion of the gas , a zone with low density and high temperature will be formed behind the shockfront , the so  called _ high  entropy bubble _ @xcite .",
    "the nucleosynthesis in the high  entropy bubble is thought to proceed as follows . due to the high temperature",
    ", the previously produced nuclei up to iron will be destroyed again by photodisintegration . at temperatures of about 10@xmath64k the nuclei",
    "would be dismantled into their constituents , protons and neutrons . at slightly lower temperatures one is still left with @xmath0particles . during the subsequent cooling of the plasma",
    "the nucleons will recombine again , first to @xmath0particles , then to heavier nuclei , starting with the reactions 3@xmath65c and @xmath66be , followed by @xmath67be(@xmath0,n)@xmath68c . depending on the exact temperatures , densities and the neutron excess ,",
    "quite different abundance distributions can be produced in this _",
    "@xmath0rich freeze  out _ ( sometimes also called _ @xmath0process _ , not to be confused with the @xmath0process erronously defined by @xcite , @xcite ) , as compared to the nuclear statistical equilibrium found in the late evolution phases of massive stars  @xcite . temperature and density",
    "are dropping quickly in the adiabatically expanding high  entropy bubble .",
    "this will hinder the recombination of alpha particles into heavy nuclei , leaving a high @xmath69 and sufficient neutrons for an r  process , ( acting on the newly produced material ) at the end of the @xmath0process after freeze  out of charged particle reactions .",
    "it should be noted that there are still many open questions and that we still lack a complete , quantitative understanding of the explosion mechanism of type ii supernovae , although progress has been made with improved neutrino transport schemes  @xcite and in multidimensional calculations ( @xcite , @xcite ;  @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . therefore , consistent calculations like @xcite   or @xcite   still bear some uncertainties , especially with respect to the entropies actually obtained .",
    "only a mass of 10@xmath70 to 10@xmath71m@xmath38 of processed matter has to be ejected per supernova event to provide the quantities derived from galactic properties  @xcite .    due to the large difficulties still encountered in type ii supernova calculations , a variety of other models for possible r  process sites had been suggested .",
    "common to all these scenarios is , of course , that they have to be able to provide the necessary conditions for the r ",
    "process , as described above . among these are `` bubbles '' or `` jets '' ejected by the collapse of rotating stellar cores , accretion discs around colliding neutron stars ( neutron star mergers ) and collisions between a neutron star and a black hole ( see  @xcite @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility of a primordial production of at least a floor of r ",
    "process elements is discussed below .      according to the big bang model of cosmology",
    "the early universe could provide the conditions for nucleosynthesis processes creating light elements up to lithium . for more detailed reviews on this topic",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite  , @xcite  , @xcite",
    ". the synthesis does not immediately start at weak freeze  out ( @xmath72mev , age of the universe @xmath73s ) because of the large number of photons relative to nucleons ( @xmath74 ) . as the nucleosynthesis chain begins with the formation of deuterium through the process",
    "p+n@xmath75d+@xmath8 , it is delayed past the point where the temperature has fallen below the deuterium binding energy , which is at @xmath76mev .",
    "nucleosynthesis proceeds by further neutron , proton and light nuclei capture on deuterium , to form @xmath77h , @xmath77he , @xmath78he ( which is the dominant product of big bang nucleosynthesis with an abundance close to 25% by mass ) , and even heavier nuclei .",
    "however , the gaps existing among stable nuclei at mass numbers @xmath79 and @xmath80 inhibit the formation of nuclei beyond @xmath80 . therefore",
    ", the standard big bang can produce only d , @xmath77he , @xmath78he , and @xmath81li in appreciable amounts .",
    "the strength of the standard big bang scenario is that only one free parameter ( @xmath82 ) must be specified to determine all the primordial abundances , ranging over 10 orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between observed and predicted abundances forms one of the cornerstones supporting the big bang model .    a number of possible mechanisms",
    "have been suggested to generate density inhomogeneities in the early universe which could survive until the onset of primordial nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
    "such inhomogeneities could change primordial nucleosynthesis in such a way as to enable the production of heavier elements by by  passing the mass gaps through the reaction sequence + @xmath81li(n,@xmath8)@xmath83li(@xmath0,n)@xmath84b(n,@xmath8)@xmath68b(@xmath85)@xmath68c(n,@xmath8)@xmath3c(n,@xmath8)@xmath86c  + this sequence is inhibited in the relatively proton rich standard big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , in inhomogeneous models the `` bubbles '' of density fluctuations translate into regions of different neutron  to  proton ratios , due to the different mean free diffusion paths of the neutral neutrons and the electrically charged protons .",
    "thus , it becomes possible that neutrons are even over  abundant in the low density zones , whereas the protons remain trapped in the high  density regions .",
    "while in a proton  rich region charged  particle reactions will play the dominant role ( just as in the standard big bang ) , neutron ",
    "induced reactions will be important in the neutron ",
    "rich environment  @xcite .",
    "it was found that not only elements up to carbon and oxygen could be produced but that it was even possible to synthesize r  process nuclei .",
    "although this is done in the low density regions , large abundances can be obtained by _ fission cycling _  @xcite . in an r  process with fission cycling the production of heavy nuclei is not limited to the r  process flow coming from light nuclei but requires only a small amount of fissionable nuclei to be produced initially .",
    "the total mass fraction of heavy nuclei is doubled with each fission cycle and can thus be written as @xmath87 , with @xmath88 denoting the initial mass fraction of heavy nuclei . the cycle number @xmath89 is decreasing with decreasing neutron number density @xmath90 ( and increasing temperature @xmath91 ) because the reaction flux experiences longer half  lives when the r  process path is moving closer to stability .    because of the exponential increase in r  process abundances , with a sufficient number of cycles during the primordial nucleosynthesis era one can even arrive at abundances exceeding the ones found in the solar system .",
    "thus , nucleosynthesis can put severe constraints on the conditions found in the early universe .",
    "contrary to previous estimates , though , it was found that r  processing will only occur at conditions already ruled out by the light element abundances found in the proton  rich , `` standard '' zones  @xcite .",
    "although inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis could not fulfill the hopes put in it initially ( e.g. , providing the means of setting @xmath92 in accordance with the inflationary model ) , it still has to be considered since one still can not completely rule out the existence of density inhomogeneities in the early universe .",
    "( note , however , that these inhomogeneities would be on a scale far too small to solve the current problems in explaining galaxy formation and the large  scale structure of the universe .",
    "the characteristic length of such a region has expanded to a current value of 10@xmath86 m now  @xcite .",
    "this is about 1000 times the distance from earth to the sun and about 1% the distance to the nearest star , tiny by astronomical standards . )",
    "although ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions play an important role in the reaction networks of light isotopes up to the calcium isotopes we will focus our discussion on experimental methods for the detection of the neutron radiative capture process that occurs at all mass numbers . in some cases",
    "the ( n , p ) and ( n,@xmath0 ) reactions even dominate over the ( n,@xmath8 ) process and hence modify the nucleosynthesis path ( see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .    the measurement of neutron radiative capture reaction cross sections for astrophysics requires neutron sources covering an energy range from a few ev to 500kev and detection telescopes for the counting of the reaction events . for the production of a neutron flux of a sufficient strength ,",
    "research reactors , but especially accelerators ( e.g. , van de graaff and electron linear accelerators ) , are currently used . for the detection of the reaction events , signatures characterizing the capture process",

    "the first method , which we will call the _ direct detection method , _ can be applied in principle to each isotope , whereas the second method ( decay counting ) requires an unstable reaction product with suitable decay characteristics ( e.g. , convenient half  life , strong @xmath8ray decay lines ) .",

    "the most straightforward method to detect capture events independent from the details of the prompt @xmath8ray cascades is to sum over all @xmath8cascades to obtain a signal proportional to @xmath95=@xmath100=@xmath101 .",
    "an ideal detector covering the entire solid angle of 4@xmath102 would then yield a spectrum of capture events consisting of a peak at the energy @xmath95 .",
    "however , in differential detection systems ( using the time  of flight  method ) is is difficult to separate signals from scattered neutrons and true capture events .",
    "therefore , the detector should be insensitive to scattered neutrons as scattering is about 10 times more likely than capture in the energy region of astrophysical interest .",
    "the first total absorption detection systems to be constructed with low neutron sensitivity were large liquid scintillation tanks of a volume ranging from 300 to 3000 liters viewed by photomultiplier tubes and with a through  hole to place the capture sample .",
    "however , those systems had serious drawbacks .",
    "the absorption of all @xmath8radiation can not be achieved .",
    "the peak around the excitation energy in the capture process has a large tail towards the lower energies due to partial escape of radiation .",
    "the 2.2mev background from hydrogen capture in the scintillator limits the determination of the peak fraction below .",
    "therefore , an efficiency of typically 70% for the detection of the capture events is obtained .",
    "the idea of total absorption detection has been further improved by using a ball of scintillation crystals viewed by photomultiplier tubes instead of a liquid scintillation tank .",
    "these crystal ball type detectors were first constructed with nai(tl ) crystals to measure @xmath8ray cascades in heavy ion reactions . using baf@xmath103 crystals the crystal ball detector was also suitable for neutron capture measurements .",
    "the neutron sensitivity is considerably lower than that of nai(tl ) , fast timing is possible because of a fast component in the scintillation light ( 600ps decay time ) , and the energy resolution is comparable to that of nai(tl ) . at the karlsruhe 3.75mv van de graaff accelerator such",
    "a detector has been constructed and successfully used to determine neutron capture cross sections .",
    "the detector consists of 42 baf@xmath103 crystals coupled to photomultiplier tubes , 12 pentagon and 30 hexagon crystals , which form a spherical shell of 15 cm thickness .",
    "the loss in 4@xmath102 solid angle due to the openings for the neutron beam , the samples , and leaks between the crystals is less than 5% .",
    "the total efficiency in the measurements is close to 95% .",
    "the accuracy claimed in these capture measurements is as good as 1% .",
    "details of this detector are well documented  @xcite and a series of astrophysically important isotopes has been measured  @xcite .",
    "elements were selected with two or three s  only isotopes in the isotopic chain ( e.g. , @xmath104te , @xmath105ba , @xmath106sm , @xmath107gd ) . however , because the van de graaff accelerator as a white neutron source for time  of  flight measurements can not provide enough neutrons in the energy range from a few ev to about 5kev the measurement of the excitation function of an isotope must remain incomplete .",
    "consequently the maxwellian ",
    "averaged capture ( mac ) cross sections can not be determined at the temperature of the @xmath3c(@xmath0,n ) astrophysical neutron source ( @xmath108812kev ) without relying on supplementing cross  section data from literature . in the s  process",
    "the crucial isotopes are the so  called bottleneck isotopes with magic neutron shells and well  resolved resonance structure up to 100kev . for the measurement of these species another accelerator and detection method , the total energy detection ,",
    "is preferred . in these measurements the required energy range",
    "is completely covered and the resonance strengths are determined with an optimum signal  to  background ratio .",
    "systems for total energy detection in use are the moxon ",
    "rae detector and a generalization of this detection principle to any @xmath8ray detection system .",
    "the principle of these detector types is opposite to the total absorption detectors .",
    "the aim is not to sum up the @xmath8ray cascades of the capture process but to detect not many more than one of the emitted photons of the cascade from each capture event .",
    "mainly , this requires a low efficiency detector .",
    "the moxon ",
    "rae detector consists of a graphite disc for converting @xmath8rays into electrons followed by a thin plastic scintillator coupled to a phototube to detect the electrons . in this way",
    "the efficiency ( @xmath1091% ) becomes proportional to the detected @xmath8ray energy @xmath110 .",
    "accumulating the capture events with such a detector then results in an overall efficiency in the capture measurement of @xmath111 which is proportional to the excitation energy of the capture process , and , therefore , independent of the details of the individual cascades .",
    "this simple detector principle has been extensively used for measurements because of its fast timing abilities and the low sensitivity to scattered neutrons .",
    "unfortunately for moxon ",
    "rae detectors the proportionality of the @xmath8efficiency to @xmath8energy is only fulfilled approximately .",
    "however , the principle of total energy detection can be applied to each kind of detector system provided the detector response @xmath112 ) , i.e. , the probability that a @xmath8ray of energy @xmath113 gives rise to a pulse of amplitude @xmath114 , is transformed on or off ",
    "line by a so  called weighting function w(i ) to an efficiency proportional to the detected photon energy @xmath113 : @xmath115 the integration limits @xmath116 and @xmath117 are chosen to cover the expected pulse height amplitudes in the capture process .",
    "this elegant generalization of the moxon ",
    "rae detector was first applied by macklin and gibbons   to a detector system consisting of a pair of c@xmath118f@xmath118 liquid scintillation detectors . in this way",
    "the efficiency of the detector could be increased to about 15% but the use of this detector for capture measurements depends on an accurate determination of the weighting function , chiefly a property of the detector system .",
    "the new detector keeps the advantages of the moxon ",
    "rae detector , good timing properties and low neutron sensitivity , and improves it in efficiency and in the property of total energy detection . instead of the c@xmath118f@xmath118 scintillator , c@xmath118d@xmath118 with a lower neutron sensitivity",
