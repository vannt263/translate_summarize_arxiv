    "one of the greatest challenges in nuclear science is understanding the structure of light nuclei from both experimental and theoretical perspectives .",
    "figure 1 was used by catford to summarize the different types of clustering discussed during the last cluster conference in debrecen  @xcite .",
    "most of these structures were investigated in an experimental context by using either some new approaches or developments of older methods  @xcite .",
    "starting in the 1960s the search for resonant structures in the excitation functions for various combinations of light @xmath2-cluster ( @xmath0=@xmath1 ) nuclei in the energy regime from the coulomb barrier up to regions with excitation energies of @xmath3=20@xmath450  mev remains a subject of contemporary debate  @xcite .",
    "these resonances  @xcite have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question of how quasimolecular resonances may reflect continuous transitions from scattering states in the ion - ion potential to true cluster states in the compound systems was still unresolved in the 1990s  @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with @xmath2-clustering phenomena @xcite , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach , the cranked @xmath2-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite . in light",
    "@xmath2-like nuclei clustering is observed as a general phenomenon at high excitation energy close to the @xmath2-decay thresholds @xcite .",
    "this exotic behavior has been perfectly illustrated by the famous ",
    "ikeda - diagram \" for @xmath0=@xmath1 nuclei in 1968 @xcite , which has been modified and extended by von oertzen @xcite for neutron - rich nuclei more than 10 years ago , as shown in the left panel of figure 2 .",
    "clustering is a general feature @xcite not only observed in typical light neutron - rich nuclei @xcite , but also in less common systems such as the neutron - halo @xmath5li @xcite and/or @xmath6be nuclei , for instance @xcite .",
    "the problem of cluster formation has also been treated extensively for very heavy systems by gupta @xcite , by zagrebaev and greiner @xcite and by simenel @xcite where giant molecules and collinear ternary fission may co - exist @xcite . finally , signatures of @xmath2 clustering have also been discovered in light nuclei undergoing ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite . in this introductory talk ,",
    "i will limit myself first to the light @xmath7c and @xmath8o @xmath2-like nuclei in section 2 , then to @xmath2 clustering , deformations and @xmath2 condensates in heavier @xmath2-like nuclei in section 3 , and , finally , to clustering in light neutron - rich nuclei in section 4 .",
    "the renewed interest in @xmath7c was mainly focused to a better understanding of the nature of the so called `` hoyle '' state @xcite that can be described in terms of a bosonic condensate , a cluster state and/or a @xmath2-particle gas @xcite .",
    "much experimental progress has been achieved recently as far as the spectroscopy of @xmath7c near and above the @xmath2-decay threshold is concerned  @xcite .",
    "more particularly , the 2@xmath9 `` hoyle '' rotational excitation in @xmath7c has been observed by several experimental groups @xcite .",
    "the most convincing experimental result , displayed in figure 3 , comes from measurements of the @xmath7c(@xmath10,@xmath2)@xmath11be reaction performed at the higs facility @xcite .",
    "the angular distributions of the alpha particles in the region of 9 - 10 mev are consistent with an l=2 pattern , including a dominant 2@xmath12 component .",
    "this 2@xmath9 state that appears at around 10 mev is considered to be the 2@xmath12 excitation of the `` hoyle '' state ( in agreement with the previous experimental investigation of itoh et al .",

    "hoyle '' state @xcite in @xmath7c is most certainly going to decay exclusively by particle emission with very small @xmath10-decay branches , thus , very efficient particle-@xmath10 coincidence techniques will have to be used in the near future to search for them .",
    "bec states are expected to decay by alpha emission to the  hoyle \" state and could be found among the resonances in @xmath2-particle inelastic scattering on @xmath7c decaying to that state . in 1967",
    "chevallier et al .",
    "@xcite could excite these states in an @xmath2-particle transfer channel leading to the @xmath20be@xmath20be final state and proposed that a structure corresponding to a rigidly rotating linear arrangement of four alpha particles may exist in @xmath8o .",
    "very recently , a more sophisticated experimental setup was used at notre dame @xcite : although the excitation function is generally in good agreement with the previous results @xcite a phase shift analysis of the angular distributions does not provide evidence to support the reported hypothesis of a 4@xmath2-chain state configuration .",
    "experimental investigations are still underway to understand the nuclear structure of high spin states of both @xmath8o and @xmath17ne nuclei for instance at notre dame @xcite and/or ithemba labs @xcite facilities .",
    "another possibility might be to perform coulomb excitation measurements with intense @xmath8o and @xmath17ne beams at intermediate energies .",
    "the real link between superdeformation ( sd ) , nuclear molecules and alpha clustering @xcite is of particular interest , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 are typical ellipsoidal elongations for light nuclei ( corresponding to a quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath21 @xmath19 0.6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes ( hyperdeformation ( hd ) with @xmath21 @xmath19 1.0 ) has also been discussed for actinide nuclei @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "typical examples for the possible relationship between quasimolecular bands and extremely deformed ( sd / hd ) shapes have been widely discussed in the literature for @xmath22 @xmath2-conjugate @xmath0=@xmath1 nuclei , such as @xmath23si @xcite , @xmath24s @xcite , @xmath15ar @xcite , @xmath25ca @xcite , @xmath26ti @xcite , @xmath27cr @xcite and @xmath28ni @xcite .",
    "highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been discovered in several light @xmath2-conjugate ( @xmath0=@xmath1 ) nuclei , such as @xmath15ar and @xmath25ca by using @xmath10-ray spectroscopy techniques @xcite . in particular , the extremely deformed rotational bands in @xmath15ar @xcite ( shown as crosses in figure  4 ) might be comparable in shape to the quasimolecular bands observed in both @xmath7c+@xmath16 mg ( shown as open rectangles in figure  4 ) and @xmath8o+@xmath17ne ( shown as full rectangles in figure  4 ) reactions .",
    "ternary clusterizations are also predicted theoretically , but were not found experimentally in @xmath15ar so far @xcite . on the other hand , ternary fission of @xmath28ni  related to its hyperdeformed ( hd ) shapes",
    " was claimed to be identified from out - of - plane angular correlations measured in the @xmath24s+@xmath16 mg reaction with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) at the vivitron tandem facility of the iphc , strasbourg @xcite , though this remains to be confirmed @xcite .",
    "this possibility @xcite is not limited to light @xmath0=@xmath1 compound nuclei , true ternary fission @xcite can also occur for very heavy @xcite and superheavy @xcite nuclei .",
    "the next natural question to be addressed is whether dilute - gas - like structures ( i.e. bec ) @xcite also exist in medium - mass @xmath2-conjugate nuclei as predicted by several theoretical investigations @xcite .",
    "several recent undergoing experiments indicate that it might be the case at least for @xmath16 mg @xcite , @xmath15ar @xcite and @xmath28ni @xcite and much work is in progress in this field @xcite .",

    "square and triangle symbols correspond to cluster bands , whereas diamonds symbols correspond to molecular bands.(figure adapted from @xcite courtesy from von oertzen ) . ]",
    "as discussed previously , clustering is a general phenomenon observed also in nuclei with extra neutrons as it is presented in an extended `` ikeda - diagram '' @xcite proposed by von oertzen @xcite ( see the left and middle panels of figure  2 ) . with additional neutrons ,",
    "specific molecular structures appear with binding effects based on covalent molecular neutron orbitals . in these diagrams",
    "@xmath2-clusters and @xmath8o - clusters are the main ingredients . actually , the @xmath6c nucleus may play a similar role in clusterisation as the @xmath8o nucleus does .",
    "both of them have similar properties as a cluster : i ) closed neutron p - shells , ii ) first excited states are well above e@xmath30 = 6 mev , and iii ) high binding energies for @xmath2-particles .",
    "a general picture of clustering and molecular configurations in light nuclei can be drawn from a detailed investigation of the oxygen isotopes with a @xmath31 17 . here",
    "i will only present recent results on the even - even oxygen isotopes : @xmath29o @xcite and @xmath17o @xcite .",
    "but very striking cluster states have also been found in odd - even oxygen isotopes such as : @xmath32o @xcite and @xmath33o @xcite .",
    "figure 5 gives an overview of all bands in @xmath29o as a plot of excitation energies as a function of j(j+1 ) together with their respective moments of inertia . in the assignment of the bands both",
    "the dependence of excitation energies on j(j+1 ) and the dependence of measured cross sections on 2j+1 @xcite were considered .",
    "slope parameters obtained in a linear fit to the excitation energies @xcite indicate the moment of inertia of the rotational bands given in figure  5 .",
    "the intrinsic structure of the cluster bands is reflection asymmetric , the parity projection gives an energy splitting between the partner bands .",
    "the assignment of the experimental molecular bands are supported by either generator - coordinate - method @xcite or antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations @xcite .",
    "the bands of @xmath17o @xcite shown in figure  6 can be compared with those of @xmath29o displayed in figure .",
    "the first doublet ( k=0@xmath34 ) has a slightly larger moment of inertia ( smaller slope parameter ) in @xmath17o , which is consistent with its interpretation as @xmath6c@xmath35he or @xmath8c@xmath36he molecular structures ( they start well below the thresholds of 16.8 mev and 12.32 mev , respectively ) . the second band , for which the negative parity partner has yet to be determined , has a slope parameter slightly smaller than in @xmath29o",
    "this is consistent with the study of the bands in @xmath17o by furutachi et al .",
    "@xcite , which clearly establishes parity inversion doublets predicted by amd calculations for the @xmath6c@xmath37he quasimolecular ( cluster ) and @xmath6c-2n-@xmath2 molecular structures .",
    "the corresponding moments of inertia illustrated in figure  4 and figure  5 are strongly suggesting large deformations for the cluster structures .",
    "it may be concluded that the reduction of the moments of inertia of the lowest bands of @xmath38o is consistent with the assumption that the strongly bound @xmath6c nucleus have equivalent properties to @xmath8o .",
    "it is interesting to note that the quantum mechanical fragmentation theory ( qmft ) of gupta @xcite reaches to the same conclusion on the possibility of @xmath6c clustering @xcite .",
    "therefore , the `` ikeda - diagram '' @xcite and the `` extended ikeda - diagram '' consisting of @xmath8o cluster cores with covalently bound neutron @xcite must be further extended to include also the @xmath6c cluster cores as illustrated in right panel of figure 2 .",
    "the connection of @xmath2-clustering , quasimolecular resonances , @xmath2 condensates in very light nuclei and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) in heavier nuclei as investigated by more and more sophisticated experimental devices , has been discussed in this introductory talk . in particular , high - precision spectroscopy techniques unable us to uncover important parts of the complete spectroscopy of the so called `` hoyle '' state in @xmath7c .",
    "the origin of carbon for life is likely to be understood in the very near future with answer to the question of the `` hoyle '' state structure . similarly the quest for the 4@xmath2 states of @xmath8o near the @xmath20be+@xmath20be and @xmath7c+@xmath2 decay thresholds , which correspond to the  hoyle `` state .",
    "results have also been presented on neutron - rich oxygen isotopes displaying very well defined quasimolecular bands in agreement with amd predictions .",
    "consequently , the ' ' extended ikeda - diagram \" has been further extended for light neutron - rich nuclei by inclusion of the @xmath6c cluster as a core , similarly to the @xmath8o one .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued by @xmath10-ray spectroscopy measurements , will have to be performed in conjunction with charged - particle techniques in the near future since such states are most likely going to decay by particle emission ( see @xcite ) .",
