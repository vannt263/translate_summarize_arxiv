    "designs for multi - user communications networks and systems have been extensively used during the past decade to implement low - cost , scalable , and limited - message - passing networks . in doing so",
    ", transmitter and receiver pairs with local information determine their transmission strategies in an autonomous manner . to deploy such designs , it is essential to know whether they converge to a ( preferably unique ) equilibrium , and evaluate their performances at the emerging equilibrium / equilibria .",
    "strategic non - cooperative game theory provides an appropriate framework for analyzing and designing such environments where users ( i.e. , transmitter - receiver pairs ) are rational and self - interested players that aim to maximize their own utilities by choosing their transmission strategies . the notion of nash equilibrium ( ne ) ,",
    "at which no user can attain a higher utility by unilaterally changing its strategy , is frequently used to analyze the equilibrium point of non - cooperative games . to derive the conditions for ne s existence and uniqueness , different approaches such as fixed point theory , contraction mapping and _ variational inequalities ( vi ) _",
    "@xcite have been widely applied in both wired and wireless communication networks , including applications to flow and congestion control , network routing , and power control in interference channels @xcite .",
    "however , there are numerous sources of uncertainty in measured parameter values of communication systems and networks such as joining or leaving new users , delays in the feedback channel , estimation errors and channel variations .",
    "therefore , obtaining accurate values of users interactions may not be practical , and considering uncertainty and proposing a robust approach are essential in designing reliable communications systems and networks .    to make a ne robust against uncertainties ,",
    "two distinct approaches have been proposed in the literature : the bayesian approach where the statistics of uncertain parameters are considered and the utility of each user is probabilistically guaranteed , and the worst - case approach where a deterministic closed region , called the uncertainty region , is considered for the distance between the exact and the estimated values of uncertain parameters , and the utility of each user is guaranteed for any realization of uncertainty within the uncertainty region @xcite .",
    "both of these approaches have been applied to the power allocation problem in spectrum sharing environments and cognitive radio networks @xcite to study the conditions for ne s existence and uniqueness , where the uncertain parameters are interference levels and channel gains . however , to incorporate robustness in communications systems and networks , there exist multiple challenges such as : 1 ) how to implement robustness in a wider class of problems in communication systems ?",
    "2 ) how to derive the conditions for existence and uniqueness of the robust ne ( rne ) ?",
    "3 ) what is the impact of considering uncertainties on the system s performance at its equilibrium compared to that of the case with no uncertainty ?",
    "4 ) how to design a distributed algorithm for reaching the robust equilibrium ?    in this paper , we aim to answer the above questions using the worst - case robust optimization . in doing so",
    ", we consider a general class of games where the impact of users on each other is an additive function of their actions , which causes couplings between users .",
    "we refer to this class of game as the additively coupled games ( acgs ) . in the acg , we consider that the users observations of such impacts are uncertain due to variations in system parameters and changes in other users strategies . via the worst - case approach",
    ", we assume that uncertain observations by each user are bounded in the uncertainty region , and each user aims to maximize its utility for the worst - case condition of error .",
    "we refer to an acg that considers uncertainty as a robust acg ( racg ) , and an acg that does not consider uncertainty as the nominal acg ( nacg ) .",
    "to study the conditions for existence and uniqueness of the rne , we apply _ vi _",
    "@xcite , and show that with bounded and convex uncertainty , the rne always exists . we also show that the rne is a perturbed solution of _ vi _ , and derive the condition for rne s uniqueness based on the condition for ne s uniqueness .    furthermore , we compare the performance of the system at the rne with that at the ne in terms of two measures : 1 ) the difference between the users strategies at the rne and the ne , 2 ) the difference between the social utility at the rne and at the ne .",
    "when the rne is unique , we derive the upper bound for the difference between social utilities at the rne and at the ne , and show that the social utility at the rne is always less than that at the ne .",
    "however , obtaining these two measures is not straightforward when the ne is not unique . in this case",
    ", we demonstrate a condition in which the social utility at a rne is higher than that at the corresponding ne .",
    "finally , we apply the proximal response map to propose a distributed algorithm for reaching the rne , and derive the conditions for its convergence .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we summarize the system model of the nacg . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the racg and its rne .",
    "section iv covers the existence and uniqueness conditions if the rne . in section",
    "v , we show that when the utility function is logarithmic , the rne can be obtained via affine _ vi _ ( _ avi _ ) , and its uniqueness condition is simplified . in section",
    "vi , we propose distributed algorithm for reaching rne . in section vii , we discuss the effects of robustness for the case of multiple nash equilibria , followed by section viii , where we provide simulation results to illustrate our analytical developments for the power allocation problem and for the jackson networks .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section ix .",

    "* when @xmath231 is a semi negative definite matrix and @xmath232 for all users , the social utility at the rne is higher than that at the ne .",
    "see appendix g.    proposition 2 implies that when the reduction in the social utility due to the decrease in user s strategies is less than their increase in the social utility due to the decrease in other usrs strategies , introducing robustness in the game increases the social utility .",

    "this is an opportunistic phenomenon in robust games when the game encounters multiple nes . in order to benefit from this and increase the social utility , we propose an opportunistic distributed algorithm in table [ tableopportunesticalgorithm ]",
    "obviously , checking the conditions of proposition 2 in a distributive manner is not easy .",
    "in addition the social utility may increase under other conditions .",
    "therefore , all users play the game @xmath41 without considering the uncertainty . if @xmath235 for user @xmath6 , i.e. , the nacg has multiple nes , users assume uncertainty in their observations . when their utilities increase , they expand their uncertainty regions .",

    "we use simulations in the two examples in table i to provide an insight into the performance of @xmath113 for different bounds on uncertainty region as compared to that of @xmath41 . in the following simulations , the value of @xmath233 is normalized to the nominal value of @xmath242 , i.e. , @xmath243 , each uncertainty region",
    "is considered as a linear norm with order 2 , i.e. , an ellipsoidal region , and uncertainty for all users is assumed to be the same , denoted by @xmath244 .      for the power control game , we begin by studying the effect of uncertainty on its performance in both robust and non - robust approaches in terms of utility variations at their equilibria .",
    "to do so , we consider @xmath245 users and @xmath246 , and the amount of uncertainty is assumed to be @xmath247 at the rne .",
    "after convergence to the rne and to the ne , the system parameter varies uniformly from @xmath248 to @xmath249 , which causes variations in the utility of each user at the ne and at the rne .",

    "next , in fig . [ 6 ] , we compare the effect of uncertainty when theorem 2 holds with that of the case when it does not hold , in terms of the ratio of the social utility at the rne and at the ne for different amounts of uncertainty .",

    "note that when the ne is unique , the total throughput of the system gradually decreases , but for the case of multiple nes , no uniformity is observed .",
    "for example , when @xmath251 , the total achieved utility is higher at the rne as compared to that at the ne ; and when @xmath252 , the ratio falls substantially .",
    "the trend is not monotonic for different values of uncertainty , e.g. , the social utility at the rne is higher for @xmath253 as compared to those for @xmath254 and @xmath255 . in fig . [",

    "note that as shown in this figure , the convergence time of the proximal response map is longer than that of the iwfa without any uncertainty for users .",
    "finally , in fig . [ 8 ] , we compare the performance of the opportunistic approach with that of the nominal game using @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the achieved utility of user @xmath6 by utilizing the opportunistic algorithm at the end of the algorithm .",

    "note that when robustness is not applied , neither of the two algorithms converge to the ne , and increasing uncertainty increases the queuing delay .",

    "[ 9](a ) and [ 9 ] ( b ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath270 , the total delay increases up to @xmath271 as compared to that at the ne , while the total delay is about @xmath272 at the rne .",
    "therefore , rnes are stable , and the iterative algorithm converges very fast .",
    "note that proximal response map , the convergence rate increases when uncertainty region is expanded .",
    "[ 11 ] shows the probability of rne s convergence , versus the total routing probability @xmath273 for different uncertainty regions .",
    "note that by increasing uncertainty , the system converges to the rne for a smaller value of @xmath274 as compared to that of the ne ( i.e. , @xmath275 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath276 , only for @xmath277 , the system converges to its equilibrium , while for @xmath278 , the value of @xmath274 can be up to @xmath279 for convergence to the rne .",
    "[ 11 ] shows that the effect of uncertainty is more profound in a network with a high probability of packet loss , causing poor performance , i.e. , large delays in the network .",
    "therefore , from a practical perspective , when the system encounters a high degree of uncertainty , all nodes should reduce their probability of packet drops and increase their routing probability .",
    "we studied the rne for a wide range of problems in communication systems and networks when users impact on each other can be modeled as an additive function of system parameters and users strategies . in this game , since the user s observations of these impacts are uncertain , each user optimizes its utility using worst - case robust optimization .",
    "we showed that the theory of finite - dimension _ vi _ and its sensitivity analysis can be used to obtain the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the rne when there is no closed - form solution to the optimization problem of each entity .",

    "<S> we study the robust nash equilibrium ( rne ) for a class of games in communications systems and networks where the impact of users on each other is an additive function of their strategies . </S>",
    "<S> each user measures this impact , which may be corrupted by uncertainty in feedback delays , estimation errors , movements of users , etc . to study the outcome of the game in which such uncertainties are encountered , we utilize the worst - case robust optimization theory . </S>",
    "<S> the existence and uniqueness conditions of rne are derived using finite - dimensions variational inequalities . to describe the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the system , we use two criteria measured at the rne and at the equilibrium of the game without uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the difference between the respective social utility of users and , the second is the differences between the strategies of users at their respective equilibria . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are obtained for the case of a unique ne and multiple nes . to reach the rne , we propose a distributed algorithm based on the proximal response map and derive the conditions for its convergence . </S>",
