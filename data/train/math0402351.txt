    "so , at least locally , the contraction property should be preserved .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expand on this here since it seems possible to use a rather different approach @xcite , which has been used for similar problems in game theory , to establish a slightly weaker type of convergence result for all @xmath435 , and probably even on the larger compact set @xmath137 of lemma  .",
    "in this article , we have shown that , for the extreme parameter values @xmath3 ( internal uc ) and @xmath4 ( random uc ) , any initial configuration satisfying a specific condition converges to one of the known fixed points , both in discrete and continuous time .",
    "the condition to be met is , for @xmath3 , the existence of the @xmath34-th moment ( @xmath125 , see theorem  ) , respectively , for @xmath4 , that the corresponding generating function has a radius of convergence @xmath520 ( theorem  ) .",
    "convergence takes place in the total variation norm in all cases .",
    "as argued in the previous section , similar results can be expected for the intermediate parameter values as well .",
    "these results are valid for deterministic dynamics and thus correspond to the case of infinite populations .",
    "with respect to biological relevance , however , we add some arguments that it is reasonable to expect this to be a good description for large but finite populations as well , i.e.ifnextchar , , for the underlying ( multitype ) branching process . for finite state spaces , such as in the mutation ",
    "selection models discussed in @xcite , the results by ethier and kurtz ( * ? ? ?",
    "11.2.1 ) and the generalization ( * ? ? ?",
    "v.7.2 ) of the kesten  stigum theorem @xcite guarantee that in the infinite population limit the relative genotype frequencies of the branching process converge almost surely to the deterministic solution ( if the population does not go to extinction ) . since for the uc models considered here the equilibrium distributions are exponentially small for large copy numbers ( owing to theorem   also for @xmath428 0,1 \\mathclose[}$ ] )",
    ", one can expect these systems to behave very much like ones with finitely many genotypes .",
    "this is also supported by several simulations .",
    "nevertheless , this questions deserves further attention .",
