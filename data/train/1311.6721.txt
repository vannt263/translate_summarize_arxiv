    "with the discovery of the higgs boson  @xcite , particle physics is entering a new era of precision studies of the higgs sector .",
    "the observables are many and include the higgs boson mass , its total decay width , its spin , its decay branching fractions to standard model ( sm ) particles , its possible decay branching fractions to other exotic final states , and its various production rates at colliders .",
    "all of these observables will be studied carefully in time .",
    "the theory under primary consideration in this article is the standard model .",
    "the sub - percent - level determination of the higgs boson mass now enables a complete set of input observables whereby any perturbative high - energy observable involving the higgs boson can be predicted .    in this article ,",
    "our focus is on the careful exposition of the decay partial widths and branching fractions of a sm higgs boson with mass near @xmath9 .",
    "our goal is to provide state - of - the - art formulas that can be used in any precision electroweak analysis to investigate compatibility of the data with the sm predictions in these most fundamental and sensitive observables .",
    "other calculations exist in the literature  , mostly notably from the computer program hdecay  @xcite ; however , we wish to provide an independent calculation that includes the latest advances and allows us to vary the renormalization scale in all parts of the computations . this flexibility will be useful in later discussions regarding uncertainties .",
    "we also aim to detail the errors that each input into the computation propagates to the final answer for each observable  @xcite . in some cases , these uncertainties are large , and constitute a limitation to how sensitive experimental measurements can be to determining the underlying theory parameters .",
    "finally , we discuss some implications for physics beyond the sm sensitivities in precision higgs studies .",
    "there are an infinite number of sm observables that can be defined , yet any one of them in principle can be computed precisely once a fixed , complete , independent , and finite set of input observables are specified .",
    "a convenient set of input observables is @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the list of fermion masses of the sm : @xmath12 etc .",
    "we are ignoring flavor angles for the purposes of the present discussion .",
    "we can specify @xmath13 by @xmath14 alone .",
    "the relation between the two is ( m_z)= , [ eq : alpha ] where @xmath15 is the well - known @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are perturbatively calculable and known very accurately  @xcite .",
    "the weak link to a more precise knowledge of @xmath13 is @xmath14 , which is extracted mostly via dispersion relations from @xmath19 data at low energy .",
    "since all the uncertainty of @xmath13 originates in @xmath14 , it is customary to specify that value as the input , which by , then dictates the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the values of all the input parameters are given in .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ acknowledgments : _ we thank k. chetyrkin for helpful communications .",
    "we thank a. mueck , s. heinemeyer , i. puljak , and d. rebuzzi for drawing our attention to corrections to our original @xmath20 dependencies .",
    "we wish also to thank m.  peskin for bringing to our attention the improvements in uncertainty when using @xmath21 masses directly as inputs ( see addendum for these results ) .",

    "in this appendix , we give the scale dependence to scalar correlator , @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "this contributes to the decay of higgs into heavy quarks in the following form      where @xmath25 is lowest - order cross - section without the outgoing quark masses .",
    "the scale invariance of @xmath26 together with the results for @xmath27 at @xmath28 to @xmath23 given in @xcite , leads to the following additional @xmath29 contributions to @xmath30 previously not found in literature .",
