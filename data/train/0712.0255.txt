    "elastic instabilities of nanoscale rods and in particular the euler ( buckling ) instability have long been recognized as being essential for structural as well as functional aspects of nano- and bio - systems .",
    "some time ago @xcite manning proposed that dna collapse in polyvalent salt solutions proceeds through a type of euler buckling driven by diminished electrostatic repulsive interactions between charged phosphates along the dna backbone .",
    "though the details of his picture appear to be speculative , the general framework has been completely vindicated by later work @xcite .",
    "buckling instability appears to play also an important part in the conformation of linker dna within the chromatin fiber @xcite , in the case of a growing microtubule pushing against a microfabricated rigid barrier @xcite and in the stability of afm - tips , nanotubes @xcite and nanorods @xcite .",
    "the confinement of nanoscale rods to micro- and nano - channels presents yet another set of experimental and theoretical problems @xcite centered around the technological challenges of manufacturing nanopores and nanochannels for investigating and manipulating dna . here",
    "the main theoretical thrust is in the direction of understanding the various contributions to the confinement free energy that depend on the size of the confining space and the intrinsic properties of the confined nanorods .",
    "the behavior of confined semiflexible polymers is particularly important in this context and has been recently analyzed in detail @xcite . in many respects this type of problems",
    "are mainly centered upon transverse confinement , whereas elastic instabilities described before are due to longitudinal confinement of elastic rods .    motivated by these phenomena we will try in what follows to combine the two aspects of polymer confinement described above , considering an elastic buckling instability within a confining cylindrical channel .",
    "the confinement of the elastic rod is thus twofold : longitudinal , leading to buckling , and transverse , leading straightforwardly to a helical postbuckling form .",
    "we will show that transverse confinement with frictional walls furthermore leads to a decay of the longitudinal force within the rod along the long axis of the confining channel .",
    "this will not be too difficult to rationalize since we know from other systems that longitudinal stresses can be taken up effectively by friction at confining walls . for a silo filled with granular matter and compressed on one side by a force @xmath0",
    ", janssen s equation @xcite gives an exponential decrease of the compression force with the distance @xmath1 from the compressed side , @xmath2where @xmath3 is the ratio of horizontal and vertical stresses , @xmath4 is the perimeter to cross - section area ratio , @xmath5 is the static friction coefficient and we have neglected gravity for the purpose .",
    "the same holds also for a regular elastic solid , i.e. , a rigidly confined rod , if one neglects lateral deformation gradients in the rod @xcite .",
    "there we have @xmath6,\\]]where @xmath7 is poisson s ratio . on this simple basis",
    "one expects also a conceptually similar effect , i.e. , a decrease of compression force with the distance along an elastic rod confined to a cylindrical channel in the post - buckling regime",
    ". this will allow us to hypothesize on the existence of a jamming regime for sufficiently long confined elastic rods .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : we shall first present the classical elastic model for an eulerian rod and derive the scaling relations valid for the onset of the buckling instability .",
    "we shall solve an approximate form of the elastic equations within a cylindrically confined channel and show that the longitudinal force , at least within the considered approximations , decays inversely proportional to the length of the confining channel when friction at the cylindrical wall is taken into account . to obtain exact solutions of the elastic equations",
    "we will proceed numerically and derive the minimal shape of the confined rod and the magnitude of the transmitted longitudinal force along the axis of the confining channel . at the end",
    "we will discuss what could be the conditions that would lead to a jamming of the elastic rod within the cylindrical confining channel .",
    "we model the rod as a thin eulerian elastic filament to which the standard continuum theory of elasticity can be applied .",
    "the confining channel is modeled as a straight cylindrical tube with rigid walls .",
    "the ratio @xmath8 of tube radius @xmath9 and undeformed filament length @xmath10 is the relevant geometric parameter of the system .",
    "let us briefly review the equilibrium equations for thin elastic rods @xcite .",

    "the length along the filament ) , @xmath14 is the elastic force exerted on the leading surface of the rod element ( in the sense of increasing @xmath13 ; the force on the opposite ( trailing ) side is @xmath15 , of course ) , and @xmath16 is the external force per unit length .",
    "the torque balance reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the elastic torque exerted about the center of the leading surface and @xmath19 is the unit tangent of the rod .",
    "the elastic torque is related to the deformation of the filament via @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the young modulus and we assumed that the rod is circular , i.e. , both geometric moments of inertia of the cross section are equal , @xmath22 .",
    "the first term on the right describes torsion which we assume to be absent .",
    "one can show that in case of the isotropic moment of inertia , torsion is absent everywhere in the rod when there is no twisting torque applied @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "the twisting ( torsional ) torque will be absent , i.e. , the torque in the rod will have a vanishing tangential component , @xmath23 from eqs .",
    "( [ torque - bal ] )  and  ( [ m ] ) one then gets @xmath24 as the fundamental equation describing the shape of the bent filament .",
    "the solutions of this equation with various boundary conditions are discussed in standard references on the theory of elasticity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that when a straight rod is compressed by an axial force , above threshold it undergoes a buckling instability  the so - called euler buckling  and becomes bent . for a rod with hinged ends or ends that are laterally free ( both situations are identical in this case ) , for example",
    ", the threshold force is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "what happens when the ( thin ) rod is confined within a rigid cylinder ? once the compressing force is sufficiently large so that the bent rod touches the wall of the cylinder ( let it be bent in the diameter plane ) and is further increased , there are two scenarios one can think of : the rod can bend back - and - forth staying in the diameter plane , or it can become a helix touching the cylinder wall ( spring - like configuration ) . in oil - drilling community it has been recognized for a long time that it is the latter case that eventually happens @xcite ( in fact , this is the only area of research to have studied helical buckling . )",
    "it turns out , as we will show in section  [ results ] , that there indeed exists a secondary threshold above which the planar configuration is unstable with respect to the helix .      by introducing dimensionless quantites",

    "let us digress a little and illustrate in physical terms why the force of the cylinder , @xmath41 , can not be specified until the boundary condition is known .",
