    "it is clear that , apart from the shown gaps ( where em wave propagation is not supported ) , there exist two different frequency bands ( where propagation of em waves is possible ) : a high - frequency ( hf ) and a low - frequency ( lf ) band , with @xmath114  ghz  @xmath115  ghz and @xmath116  ghz  @xmath117  ghz , respectively .",

    "numerical simulations performed in the framework of the nonlinear lattice equation , with initial conditions borrowed from the effective nls equation , revealed that the ( bright ) solitons may indeed be formed in the frequency sub - intervals predicted in the analytics . furthermore , it was shown that if the carrier frequency is chosen to be sufficiently far from characteristic frequencies ( where the dispersion and nonlinearity coefficients of the effective nls model vanish or have resonance poles ) , the numerically found soliton profile and characteristics ( center of mass and width ) are in very good agreement with the analytical predictions . although the numerical simulations were performed for relatively large computation times , the corresponding physical times were small due to the fact that all the characteristic frequencies of the system were in the microwave regime : under any choice , the physical time unit is less than a nanosecond and , thus , simulations corresponding to a few seconds would correspond to computation times of order of @xmath146 .",

    "such a higher - order nls model could also predict soliton propagation but , in this case , the soliton characteristics would be modified by the presence of the higher - order effects .",
    "thus , an interesting challenge would be the derivation of such a higher - order nls model , the study of its soliton solutions and a comparison of such findings to direct simulations .",
    "finally , while the theory and simulations presented in this work assume ideal components , for which excellent performance can be observed , the reality to be met in possible experiments might deteriorate the performance by unavoidable dispersion in component parameters .",
    "the effect of disorder is expected to be quite significant in nonlinear settings : in fact , its paramount importance has been demonstrated even in the simpler case of linear resonant systems ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and , thus , the presence of disorder may drastically affect the results in nonlinear structures . in that regard , a study of how much the considered system ( or other relevant ones ) is sensitive to disorder is certainly a relevant and important direction for future studies .",
