    "it is well - known that many special functions , e.g.  the airy , bessel , or legendre functions , originate as series solutions of _ linear _ ordinary differential equations ( odes ) . such functions play a crucial role in describing a wide range of important physical and mathematical phenomena .",
    "an essential point here is that for linear ordinary differential equations singularities of solutions can only occur at the points where the coefficients of the equation itself become singular .",
    "this makes it possible to talk about global properties of solutions ( and hence , of the corresponding special functions ) , and the asymptotic behavior of solutions near those fixed singular points .    for nonlinear equations",
    "the situation is very different .",
    "although the cauchy existence theorem guarantees _ local _ existence of the solution to a given initial value problem at an ordinary ( regular ) point , in general the domain in which this solution is defined depends not just on the equation itself , but on the initial conditions as well  solutions acquire _ movable _",
    "( i.e. , dependent on the initial values or , equivalently , on the constants of integration ) singularities .",
    "such singularities are called _ critical _ if a solution looses its single - valued character in a neighborhood of the singularity ( e.g. , when a singular point is a _ branch point _ ) .",
    "an ode is said to satisfy the _",
    "painlev property _",
    "if its general solution is free of _ movable _ critical singular points . otherwise , the riemann surface uniformizing such solution becomes dependent on the constants of integration , which prevents global analysis .",
    "thus , equivalently , the painlev property of an ode is the uniformizability of its general solution , see @xcite ( as well as the other excellent articles in the volume @xcite ) for a careful overview of these ideas .",
    "it is clear that liner equations satisfy painlev property .",
    "the importance of the painlev property for nonlinear equations is that , similar to the linear case , solutions of these equations give rise to new transcendental functions . in that sense , according to m.kruskal as quoted in @xcite , nonlinear equations satisfying this property are on the border between trivially integrable linear equations and nonlinear equations that are not integrable , and so the painlev property is essentially equivalent to ( and is a criterion of ) integrability .",
    "the search for new transcendental functions was the original motivation in the work of p.painlev who , together with his student b.gambier , had classified all of the rational second - order differential equations that have the painlev property , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . among 50 classes of equations that they found ,",
    "only _ six _ can not be reduced to linear equations or integrated by quadratures .",
    "these equations are now known as @xmath4 .",
    "solutions to these equations , the so - called _ painlev transcendents _ , are playing an increasingly important role in describing a wide range of nonlinear phenomena in mathematics and physics @xcite .    almost simultaneously with the work of p.painlev and b.gambier , the most general painlev vi equation was obtained by r.fuchs @xcite in the theory of _ isomonodromic deformations _ of fuchsian systems .",
    "this theory , developed in the works of r.fuchs @xcite , l.schlesinger @xcite , r.garnier @xcite , and then extended to the non - fuchsian case by m.jimbo , t.miwa , and k.ueno @xcite , and also by h.flaschka and a.newell @xcite , as well as the related riemann - hilbert approach @xcite , @xcite , are now among the most powerful methods for studying the structure of the painlev transcendents .    over the last thirty years a significant effort has been put towards understanding and generalizing results and methods of the classical theory of completely integrable systems to the _ discrete _ case .",
    "this is true for the theory of painlev equations as well .",
    "discrete painlev equations were originally defined as second order nonlinear difference equations that have usual painlev equations as continuous limits @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a systematic study of discrete painlev equations was started by b.grammaticos , j.hietarinta , f.nijhoff , v.papageorgiou and a.ramani , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and many different examples of such equations were obtained in a series of papers by grammaticos , ramani , and their collaborators by a systematic application of the singularity confinement criterion , see reviews @xcite , @xcite , and many references therein . discrete painlev equations also appear in a broad spectrum of important nonlinear problems in mathematics and physics , among which are the theory of orthogonal polynomials , quantum gravity , determinantal random point processes , reductions of integrable lattice equations , and , notably , as bcklund transformations of differential painlev equations .",
    "some of these problems are discrete anlogues or direct discretizations of the corresponding nonlinear problems , and some describe purely discrete phenomena .",
    "it turned out that classifying discrete painlev equations by their continuous limits , as well as the singularity confinement criterion , is not a very good approach , since such correspondence is far from being bijective .",
    "it is both possible for the same discrete equation to have different continuous painlev equations as continuous limits under different limiting procedures , and for different discrete equations to have the same continuous limit . in",
    "the seminal paper @xcite h.sakai showed that an effective way to understand and classify discrete painlev equations is through algebraic geometry . in this approach , to each equation , if we consider it as a two - dimensional first - order nonlinear system , we put in correspondence a family of algebraic surfaces @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is some collection of parameters that change , depending on the type of the equation , in an additive , multiplicative , or elliptic fashion as functions of a discrete `` time '' parameter .",
    "this family @xmath5 , by a slight abuse of terminology , is called the _ okamoto space of initial conditions _ ( that we often denote simply by @xmath7 omitting explicit dependence on parameters @xmath8 ) and it is obtained by resolving the indeterminacy points of the corresponding map @xmath9 via the blowing - up procedure . by sakai",
    "s theory , the complete resolution of indeterminacies is obtained by blowing up 9 ( possibly infinitely close ) points on @xmath10 ( or eight points on a birationally equivalent @xmath11 compactification of @xmath12 ) .",
    "the resulting surface @xmath7 has a special property that it admits a unique anti - canonical divisor @xmath13 of _ canonical type_. the orthogonal complement of @xmath14 in the picard lattice @xmath15 is described by the affine dynkin diagram @xmath16 that has two intersecting root subsystems of affine type : @xmath17 , that is generated by classes @xmath18 of irreducible components of the anticanonical divisor @xmath19 , and its orthogonal complement @xmath20 whose corresponding root lattice @xmath21 is called the _ symmetry sub - lattice_. then the _ type _ of the discrete painlev equation is the same as the _ type of its surface _",
    "@xmath5 , which is just the type of an affine dynkin diagram describing the root system @xmath17 of irreducible components @xmath18 of @xmath19 ( essentially , the degeneration structure of the positions of the blowup points ) .",
    "moreover , nonlinear painlev dynamic now becomes a translation in the symmetry sub - lattice @xmath21 , and so it becomes `` _ _ linearized _ _ '' there , see @xcite for details .",
    "this is somewhat similar to the algebro - geometric integrability of classical integrable systems and soliton equations , where nonlinear dynamic is mapped to commuting linear flows on the jacobian of the spectral curve of the associated linear problem via the abel - jacobi map .    one important observation from sakai s geometric approach is that in addition to _ additive _ ( difference ) and _ multiplicative _ ( @xmath22-difference ) _ discretizations _ of continuous painlev equations , there are some purely discrete painlev equations .",
    "it also led to the discovery of the master _",
    "discrete painlev equation such that all of the other painlev equations can be obtained from it through degenerations ( which corresponds to more and more special configurations of the blow - up points ) .",
    "this degenerations can be described by the following scheme , where letters stand for the symmetry type of the equation ( which is the type of the affine dynkin diagram of the root subsystem @xmath20 ) , and the subscripts @xmath23 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 stand for elliptic , multiplicative , additive and differential painlev equations respectively , see figure  [ fig : pain - diag ] .",

    "they are rational transformations preserving the singularity structure and the monodromy data of the system ( [ eq : fuchs-1 ] ) , except for the integral shifts in the characteristic indices @xmath49 , and so the coefficient matrix now depends on @xmath49 , @xmath54 .",
    "schlesinger transformations are given by the following _ differential  difference lax pair _",
    ": @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a specially chosen rational matrix function called the _",
    "multiplier _ of the transformation .",

    "namely , after substituting @xmath56 of the form  ( [ eq : mult - proj - gen ] ) in  ( [ eq : sch - transf ] ) ( and its inverse ) we immediately see that @xmath59 , and if we put @xmath60 and @xmath61 , we get the following equations on the coefficient matrices : @xmath62 then either  ( [ eq : q - cond ] ) or  ( [ eq : p - cond ] ) imposes important constraints on the projector @xmath63 : @xmath64 and if this condition is satisfied , we get the following dynamic on the space of coefficient matrices : @xmath65 indeed , @xmath66 and the equation for @xmath67 is obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "we call these equations _ discrete schlesinger evolution equations_.      it is sometimes more convenient to extend the dynamic from the space of coefficients of the fuchsian system to the space of eigenvectors of the coefficient matrices , we call this space the _ decomposition space_. in particular , this is the space on which both the continuous ( @xcite ) and the discrete ( @xcite ) hamiltonian equations for schlesinger deformations can be written . before defining this space",

    "<S> we present two examples of reductions from the evolution equations describing discrete schlesinger transformations of fuchsian systems to difference painlev equations : difference painlev equation d-@xmath0 with the symmetry group @xmath1 and difference painlev equation d-@xmath2 with the symmetry group @xmath3 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we describe in detail how to compute their okamoto space of the initial conditions and emphasize the role played by geometry in helping us to understand the structure of the reduction , a choice of a good coordinate system describing the equation , and how to compare it with other instances of equations of the same type . </S>"
