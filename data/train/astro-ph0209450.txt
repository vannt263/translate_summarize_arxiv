    "the simplest sed description is based on a blackbody spectrum @xmath1 $ ] at a single temperature @xmath2 , as a function of frequency @xmath3 , modified by a frequency - dependent emissivity function @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is in the range 12 ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",

    "this sed is identical to the @xmath2@xmath11@xmath5 form at long wavelengths , but tends to a pure blackbody at frequencies greater than @xmath14 , as expected from an optically thick source .",

    "four sed parameters are thus required in this model : @xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath5 as before , plus @xmath14 .",
    "there is a strong degeneracy between the value of @xmath15 and the values of @xmath2 and @xmath5 ( see section2.4 ) .",
    "hence , a reasonable value of @xmath15 that corresponds to a frequency close to the 60- and 100-@xmath0 m _ iras _ bands is usually assumed . including this frequency - dependent opacity allows a more physical description of the sed , but the parameter @xmath15 is difficult to determine unambiguously from available observed data .

    "descriptions of the sed can include more than one dust temperature .",
    "most notably , these include models based on radiative transfer calculations , in which a continuous distribution of sources is assumed in some geometry , and the temperature distribution of the dust as a function of position is calculated self - consistently to build up an sed ( granato , danese & franceschini 1996 ; devriendt et al . 1999 ; efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen 2000 ) .",
    "note , however , that even for nearby galaxies the spatial and spectral resolution available is insufficient to constrain the @xmath17 parameters required to describe this type of model even in the simplest spherical geometry .",
    "when the sub - arcsec resolution of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) interferometer and _ james webb ( next generation ) space telescope ( ngst ) _ are available at submm and near / mid - ir wavelengths , respectively , then radiative transfer models will have a role to play in interpreting observations . at present , the quality of available data does not justify the incorporation of such complexity .",
    "two more practical multi temperature sed descriptions have been used .",
    "a two - temperature model by dunne & eales ( 2001 ) includes a cool component at a fixed temperature of @xmath18k to describe dust heated by the general diffuse isrf of the galaxy , and a component of hotter dust at a temperature @xmath19 , with a mass fraction @xmath20 , that is heated more intensely in star - forming regions .",
    "each component is described by a modified blackbody @xmath21 spectrum , assuming a fixed value of the emissivity index @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting sed function @xmath23.\\ ] ] there are 3 free parameters in this model if @xmath24 is fixed at 20k and @xmath5 is fixed at 2.0 : @xmath19 and @xmath20 to describe the thermal part of the sed , and a power - law index @xmath11 , to fix the mid - ir sed . a similar two - temperature model , with a greater spread between the temperatures , is described in the context of the dust emission from galaxies that are members of the virgo cluster by popescu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "a fourth , physically motivated , and yet still adequately constrained model was described by dale et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who assumed a power - law distribution of dust masses as a function of temperature , in which the mass of dust heated to a temperature between @xmath2 and @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the spectral contribution to the sed from each temperature component is @xmath21 , and so the composite sed is given by the integral @xmath27 the value of @xmath28 effectively determines the mid - ir slope at frequencies @xmath7 , and has a close equivalence to @xmath11 above .",
    "thus there is no need to introduce another parameter to counteract the wien tail of the sed here .",
    "the value of @xmath28 required to produce the same mid - ir spectrum as the other three models is @xmath29 ( blain 1999a ) .",
    "the role of @xmath30 is equivalent to @xmath2 in the other models , and determines the frequency of the peak of the sed , subject to a weak dependence on the value of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath30 must always exceed the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature .",
    "the value of the maximum temperature @xmath31 is relatively unimportant , unless @xmath30 is very high : @xmath31 was always set to 2000k to represent the sublimation temperature of the dust .",
    "we have thus chosen to keep @xmath31 fixed and vary both @xmath30 and @xmath28 to fit the data .",
    "this model has the minor practical disadvantage that an integral must be performed , or a look - up table employed , to evaluate the sed . in the updated model of dale & helou ( 2002 ) the value of the emissivity parameter @xmath5 at wavelengths longward of 100@xmath0 m is now parametrized as a function of the intensity of the isrf . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt a constant value @xmath32 here .",
    "for all four models an additional component of synchrotron radio emission was added , by assuming the conventional far - ir  radio correlation ( condon 1992 ) between the 1.4-ghz radio emission and the flux densities in the 60- and 100-@xmath0 m _ iras _ passbands .",
    "this correlation holds with a 0.2-dek dispersion over 4 orders of magnitude in luminosity , and should provide a reasonable representation of the expected radio flux in the absence of additional radio emission from electrons accelerated by an agn .",
    "the details of the extrapolation method are described in blain ( 1999a ) .",
    "the four sed models described above were fitted to data for three well - studied galaxies with very different luminosities and rest - frame seds .",
    "the results are shown in fig.1 and table1 .",
    "the data were obtained from _ iras _ between 12 and 100@xmath0 m , from scuba at 450 and 850@xmath0 m , from other ground - based mm - wave telescopes , and from the vla at 1.4ghz in the cases of ngc958 and arp220 .",
    "the seds are reasonably well sampled all the way from the mid - ir to the radio waveband .",
    "all four models can provide a good description of these seds . in models 1 and 4",
    ", the emissivity index @xmath5 was fixed to 1.5 to reduce the size of the parameter space to search in the maximum - likelihood fitting routine , without great loss of generality or hampering the quality of the fit .",
    "a key degeneracy between fitted values of @xmath2 ( @xmath30 in model4 ) and @xmath5 is described in the next section .",
    "the width of the peak of the model seds , defined as the fractional frequency range over which the sed is reduced to half of its peak value , is the feature that differs most significantly from model to model , but never does so by more than a factor of approximately 1.5 .",
    "the different functional forms of the sed require values of temperature that can have a large dispersion .",
    "this is especially true for apm08279 + 5255 . in model2",
    "the dust cloud is inferred to become optically thick at frequencies less than the peak of the sed , requiring a much higher temperature to describe the data than in the optically thin models , reflecting the lower effective value of @xmath5 close to the peak of the sed in the optically - thick model .",
    "the peak frequency of the fitted sed is consistent with the data , and the luminosity is within the range spanned by the other three models ( see fig.1 and table1 ) .",
    "hence , model3 still provides an adequate description of the data . for the other galaxies ,",
    "the temperature required to fit the data in model1 is systematically less than that in the optically - thick model2 , again because of the effectively smaller value of @xmath5 at the sed peak in model 2 .",
    "the temperature of the warm component required to fit seds in the two - temperature model3 depends on the relative intensities of the 25- and 100-@xmath0 m _ iras _ flux densities .",
    "the value of @xmath30 required to fit the data in model4 with a power - law dust mass distribution is always lower than in the other models , reflecting its definition as a lower limit to a distribution of hotter temperatures .",
    "the factor by which it is lower than in the other models depends on the value of the mass  temperature function index @xmath28 ( equation 4 ) : a steeper decline in the proportion of dust at higher temperatures leads to a smaller difference , while a greater fraction of hot dust corresponds to a greater difference .",
    "the most significant practical degeneracy in fitting the results shown in fig.1 in all four models is between the dust temperature @xmath2 and the emissivity power - law index @xmath5 , as illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "this occurs because the peak frequency of the sed scales approximately with the value of @xmath33 , and so the ratio of @xmath5 and @xmath2 must remain approximately constant in order to reproduce the data . in model4",
    "there is an effective dust temperature @xmath2 that reflects the range of temperatures present . for a fixed value of @xmath28 this effective temperature",
    "is determined by the value of @xmath30 .",
    "considering a subset of the data can modify the position of the best fit values significantly along the extended direction of the probability contours in the figure .",
    "the other pairs of parameters @xmath2@xmath11 and @xmath11@xmath5 do not show such a degeneracy  the probability contours determined for their fit to the sed data are almost circular ( fig.3 )  and so these pairs of parameters have unique well - determined values when the model provides a good description of the observed sed .",
    "note that the bolometric far - ir luminosity of the galaxy that is derived by integrating the sed in frequency from 100ghz to the frequency equivalent to a wavelength of 1@xmath0 m changes along the ridge of the probability curve shown in the upper panel of fig.2 .",
    "the inferred luminosity increases smoothly along the ridge from @xmath34l@xmath35 when @xmath36k to @xmath37l@xmath35 when @xmath38k , with @xmath39l@xmath35 at the best - fitting value of 28k if @xmath40 .",
    "hence , there is little practical difficulty in using this description  neither the luminosity nor the peak frequency of the sed differs significantly as the permitted region in the @xmath2@xmath5 parameter space is traversed .",
    "there is however a real problem in trying to associate the values of the fitted parameters with the true physical properties of the dust grains that generate the emission .    with the exception of @xmath2 and @xmath5 in all models ( @xmath30 and @xmath5 in model4 ) and the pairs @xmath2@xmath14 and @xmath20@xmath19 in models2 and 3 respectively , the parameters are well determined .",
    "the well - determined pairs of parameters @xmath2@xmath11 and @xmath11@xmath5 are illustrated in fig.3 , with almost circular probability contours .",
    "the probabilities for the relatively ill - constrained pairs discussed above are illustrated in figs 4 and 5 .",
    "there are two points to note from these probability figures .",
    "first , along the track of maximum probability in these figures , the value of the associated bolometric far - ir luminosity of the galaxy changes by only 510per cent .",
    "this is much less variation than the factor of 2 variation across the wider range of the @xmath2@xmath5 parameter space shown in fig.2 .",
    "secondly , @xmath20 is not defined accurately even by the excellent data for ngc958 , as shown in fig.5 .",
    "hence , this is likely to provide the least informative presentation of sed data amongst the four models used . for apm08279 + 5255 ,",
    "the extra population of 20-k dust in this model can be seen generating a break in the low - frequency slope of the sed in fig.1 . the mass of cold dust present in far - ir luminous galaxies may dominate the total mass of dust at all temperatures , and provide information concerning the history of metal enrichment within , but it is far from energetically dominant , and difficult to measure to better than a factor of a few .    for consistency with our earlier treatments ( blain et al .  1999a , 2002 ; barnard & blain 2003 ) we will adopt the @xmath2@xmath11@xmath5 model ( model1 ) in the following discussions .",
    "subject to the effective dust temperature @xmath2 being slightly different from that in the other sed parametrizations , this model provides a good description of observations for galaxies ranging from low - luminosity spirals to the most luminous high - redshift systems ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the results that follow are not only valid for this description of the sed , but are generic results that apply to all 4 descriptions discussed above .",
    "the well - defined pseudo - thermal sed of dusty galaxies ( fig.1 ) offers a prospect of recognizing the redshifts of galaxies with the same intrinsic seds by comparing far - ir and submm colours .",
    "this was discussed in the context of identifying high - redshift galaxies amongst more numerous low - redshift galaxies in a shallow submm - wave survey by blain ( 1998 ) and for observations of the first generation of hard - to - identify submm galaxies , with flux - density limits from _ iras _",
    "observations by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and eales et al .",
    "eales et al .  noted that it is not possible , a priori , to be certain of whether a dusty galaxy is hot and far away , or cool and close by , and that there could be significant consequences for the cosmological implications of the population of submm - luminous galaxies if the dust temperature / redshift is not estimated correctly .",
    "if the dust temperature defining the sed is too hot , and/or the redshift of the population is too great , then the cosmological importance of submm galaxies can be overstated .",
    "the reason for the similar effects of increasing both redshift and temperature is that the peak of the sed is determined by the value of @xmath41 in the exponential term of the planck function .",
    "redshifting the spectrum by a factor of @xmath42 in frequency @xmath3 thus has a directly equivalent effect to modifying the temperature @xmath2 by the same fraction .    by assuming a narrow range of sed templates , with a tight distribution of dust temperatures , when trying to match a redshift ( hughes et al .   2002 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ) , this large degeneracy can appear to vanish , leading to unrealistically optimistic estimates of the accuracy of the derived redshifts to @xmath43 . unless a representative range of sed templates is available , perhaps including the full range of observed seds of dusty galaxies , with temperatures from less than 20k ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ) to more than 80k ( table1 ) , then the errors on photometric redshifts could be underestimated .",
    "the true error is at least as great as the fractional uncertainty in the dust temperature , even if there are very small errors on the photometric data itself .",
    "this dust temperature  redshift degeneracy is illustrated in fig.6 for the photometric data available for both the low - redshift low - luminosity galaxy ngc958 , which includes radio data , and the high - redshift , high - luminosity dusty qso apm08279 + 5255 .",
    "the availability of radio data reduces the degeneracy somewhat , as the different emission mechanisms lead to different spectral indices ( carilli & yun 1999 ; yun & carilli 2002 ) ; however , the radio  submm colour is still a much better indicator of the ratio @xmath44 than of @xmath2 and @xmath45 separately ( blain 1999a ) .",
    "the degeneracy lies along the locus @xmath46 : see fig.6 .",
    "if a fraction of the radio emission is generated by an agn , then the derived redshift will be underestimated by perhaps a large amount .",
    "a practical example of a high - redshift galaxy for which photometric redshifts may be sought is smmj14011 + 0252 , with a known redshift @xmath47 ( frayer et al .",

    "the ranges of fitted _ lt _ values that lie within 1-@xmath50 of the most probable track in fig.7 are also shown enclosed by the thinner solid and dashed lines in fig.8 . the inferred luminosity increases with increasing temperature / redshift , and does so more rapidly than the _ lt _ relation inferred for low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies by chapman et al .

    "the observational errors for all three of these brighter galaxies are much smaller than for smmj14011 + 0252 , and so the discrepancies in their photometric redshifts definitely reflect a dispersion in the _ lt _ relation rather than errors in the data points .    in order to estimate reliable photometric redshifts from submm , far / mid - ir and radio observations",
    "it is necessary to be certain of the nature of and scatter in the _ lt _ relation .",
    "this can be investigated using a variety of samples of ir - luminous galaxies with known redshifts .",
    "it is also important to determine whether the relation evolves with redshift .",
    "if it does , then this could provide insight into the astrophysics of dusty galaxies , in addition to important information for finding photometric redshifts .",
    "the accurate determination of the temperature and luminosity of dusty galaxies with known redshifts using a three - parameter @xmath2@xmath11@xmath5 sed description was illustrated above . in order to determine a temperature reliably",
    ", the redshift must be known , and flux density data must be available at frequencies both above and below the peak of the sed .",
    "radio data can be used as a proxy for mid-/far - ir data if the galaxies can be assumed to lie on the far - ir  radio correlation .",
    "the number of galaxies for which all the required far - ir / radio and submm information is available is relatively small .",
    "we now derive _ lt _ relations from three different samples of galaxies to investigate its properties from the limited existing data .",
    "we have already discussed the low - redshift _ lt _ relation derived from a large sample of _ iras _ galaxies by chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) : see the dotted lines in figs8 and 9 . however , these results are based on radio and far - ir data alone .",
    "it would be very useful to include submm data at intermediate wavelengths in order to be sure of the form of the sed .",
    "a much smaller number of low - redshift galaxies in the _ iras _ catalogue were observed at submm wavelengths in the slugs survey by dunne et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and dunne & eales ( 2001 ) . the results provide important information about both the local , low - luminosity _ lt _ relation and galaxy seds .",
    "many of these galaxies also have radio data from the ned database , and we have exploited this information , assuming the far - ir  radio correlation to improve the accuracy of the derived values of bolometric luminosity and temperature for these galaxies as compared with the slugs values .",
    "the resulting seds are thus obtained by combining radio data with the flux densities at 850 , 100 and 60@xmath0 m considered by dunne et al .",
    "the resulting quantities for 83 galaxies in the slugs sample are shown in fig.10 , along with two lines that trace the luminosity and temperature of a galaxy that is required to generate the typical flux density of a galaxy in the sample at a typical redshift for the sample .",
    "these curves provide an indication of the possible role of selection effects in limiting the extent of the scatter in the derived _ lt _ relation .",
    "if the lines lie parallel to a correlation in the plotted points , then some of the correlation could be due to selection effects acting to reduce the intrinsic scatter , by removing galaxies from the sample on the low - luminosity side of the line .",
    "this is not the only way in which selection effects could modify the observed or inferred scatter in an _ lt _ relation ; however , it provides a direct indication of whether or not selection effects are likely to be significant .    for the slugs data ,",
    "the role of selection effects is unlikely to be very significant , as almost all of the targeted _ iras _ galaxies were detected at submm wavelengths ( dunne et al .",
    "note that the luminosities and temperatures of the milky way ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ; @xmath65l@xmath35 ; @xmath66k ) and ngc891 ( alton et al .  1998 ; @xmath67l@xmath35 ; @xmath68k ) lie at luminosities slightly below the cloud of data points , whereas the low - luminosity , hot starburst galaxy m82 ( @xmath69l@xmath35 ; @xmath70k ) is significantly offset above the cloud .",
    "the apparent dispersion in the _ lt _ relation shown in fig.10 may thus be less than the true dispersion .",
    "the scatter in the temperatures derived for slugs galaxies is comparable to the scatter determined from the seds of low - redshift _ iras _ galaxies shown in fig.8 ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .      at higher redshifts , _ iras",
    "_ flux densities are available only for the most luminous galaxies .",
    "the fluxes from the _ iras _ faint source catalog ( fsc ) were correlated with data from the wide - field vla - first radio survey ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) to provide information on the _ lt _ relation for a large sample of galaxies with bolometric luminosities greater than @xmath71l@xmath35 by stanford et al .",
    "values for these galaxies were calculated assuming that the far - ir  radio correlation holds .",
    "values for the 72 galaxies from this sample with reliable redshifts , which are not fitted by extremely cold temperatures ( @xmath72k ) and thus radio - loud , are plotted in fig.11 .",
    "about 25 further galaxies from the sample of stanford et al .",
    "fall into the very cold category , thus indicating a likely @xmath73per cent contamination fraction in the sample from radio - loud agn that emit a radio flux density greater than that expected from the observed low - redshift far - ir  radio correlation .",
    "the tracks of the lines through the data confirm that neither radio nor ir selection effects should severely bias the _ lt _ relation from the sample of stanford et al . , which lies on a slightly hotter track , and is scattered by a greater amount to higher temperature as compared with the slugs sample .",
    "this suggests that hotter , perhaps more agn - rich galaxies , are represented in this more luminous , partially radio - selected sample .",
    "a similar sample of about 40 luminous southern galaxies , with radio images from the molonglo telescope and redshifts from the 2df multi - object spectrograph has recently been compiled by sadler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and could be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "our understanding of the _ lt _ relation would be much improved if submm fluxes could be determined for these galaxies with known moderate redshifts and radio and far - ir flux densities .",
    "these observations would both provide tighter constraints on their positions in the _ lt _ plane , and offer the possibility to search for evolution in the _ lt _ relation ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "another sample useful for investigating the _ lt _ relation is the 18 @xmath74 faint radio galaxies detected at 15@xmath0 m using _ iso _ in the hubble deep field ( hdf ; garrett 2002 ) .",
    "these galaxies are sampled at mid - ir wavelengths much shorter than the peak of their seds , but the radio data provides a proxy for the 60100-@xmath0 m emission close to the peak , assuming that the far - ir  radio correlation holds . a coarse upper limit to the 60-@xmath0 m flux densities of the galaxies",
    "is provided by an xscanpi analysis of the relevant _ iras _ scans .",
    "a constraint on the 60-@xmath0 m flux densities of these galaxies is essential for fitting temperatures to the radio  mid - ir data .",
    "the inferred _ lt _ relation is shown in fig.12 : it exhibits a remarkably narrow dispersion , but the errors on the data points are large .",
    "galaxies at the mid - ir wavelengths probed have spectral features associated with emission from pah molecules , and so this tight correlation is all the more surprising . a link between the intensity of pah emission and",
    "the bolometric luminosity of a galaxy has been commented on for a sample of only five galaxies by haas , klass & bianchi ( 2002 ) .",
    "an apparent link between 15@xmath0 m emission and bolometric luminosity for a larger sample of low - redshift galaxies is discussed in sections 5.3 and 5.5 of dale & helou ( 2002 ) .",
    "the tracks of typical galaxies in the sample overplotted on fig.11 show that selection effects are unlikely to be responsible for the tight correlation .",
    "it seems unlikely that the mid - ir flux density of a galaxy could be better correlated with its temperature and luminosity than data obtained closer to the peak of the sed .",
    "this would require some underlying correlation between the slope of the mid - ir sed and the total luminosity that is not apparent in existing datasets .",
    "much larger samples from _ sirtf _ from 2003 will hopefully resolve this question .      a few distant submm- and far - ir - selected galaxies ( ivison et al .",

    "2002a ) also have redshifts , and many more have recently been found using deep radio - selected galaxies ( chapman et al .",
    "initial results indicate that it is likely that the values of temperature and luminosity derived for high - redshift submm - selected dusty galaxies display a similar scatter to that shown in fig.11 .",
    "these samples are destined to grow in size , and will provide the ultimate test of the high - redshift _ lt _ relation and the reliability of far - ir photometric redshifts for high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this sample is extremely useful , as it consists of the target population for which photometric redshifts are sought at far - ir and submm wavelengths .",
    "inferred values of luminosity and temperature for high - redshift dusty galaxies with known redshifts can be found in chapman et al .",

    "note that the temperature inferred by chapman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is @xmath30 as defined in equation ( 4 ) , and so is lower by 1020per cent as compared with the definitions used here , reducing the difference between the solid line that represents the chapman et al . _",
    "lt _ relation and the dashed line representing the _ lt _ relation for luminous merging galaxies .",
    "the dispersion in the _ lt _ relation exceeds 25per cent ( 0.1dek ) at all luminosities .",
    "these results demonstrate that the dispersion in the _ lt _ relation within individual samples is less than the dispersion between samples .",
    "the stanford et al .",
    "sample is more likely to be significantly affected by radio emission from agn , which could introduce additional scatter , causing an overestimate of luminosity and an underestimate of temperature .",
    "high - luminosity sources that would be selected in submm - wave surveys are thus observed to have dust temperatures that range between 25 and 60k .",
    "the median temperature and its rms scatter in temperature are about @xmath75k , a dispersion of approximately 0.1dek .",
    "galaxies with low dust temperatures are difficult to select in the far - ir surveys from which these _ lt _ results are drawn , and so there may not necessarily be a lack of very luminous cool galaxies , despite the avoidance of points at the lower right corner of fig.13 .",
    "by contrast , there appears to be a real lack of hot , low - luminosity galaxies from the slugs and stanford et al . _ iras_-selected galaxies .",
    "an exception is one of the closest , brightest _ iras _ galaxies , m82 . despite its low luminosity of only @xmath76l@xmath35",
    ", m82 has a temperature of @xmath77k , in the empty upper left region of the figure . such hot ,",
    "dwarf galaxies are difficult to find in the _ iras _ survey , on the grounds of the limited survey volume for low - luminosity galaxies ; however , much deeper surveys using _ sirtf _ may find that this region of the _ lt _ plane is more thoroughly populated with moderate - redshift galaxies .",
    "the same points are replotted in fig.14 , segregated by the plotted symbol in redshift rather than from sample to sample .",
    "there is a natural tendency for more luminous galaxies to be selected at greater redshifts . as the population of dusty galaxies",
    "is known to evolve strongly in luminosity with redshift , this trend should be all the more apparent .",
    "however , at all redshifts the scatter in the _ lt _ relation from sample to sample appears to span the full range of the scatter seen in the combined population .",
    "the dispersion thus appears to reflect a real spread in the physical properties of galaxies present at all redshifts , and not to be due solely to a systematic evolution in a tightly dispersed _",
    "relation with redshift .",
    "there is no strong evidence in samples of _ iras_-selected galaxies for the _ lt _ relation to evolve with redshift over the approximate range @xmath78 ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the significant dispersion in the _ lt _ relation indicates that there are limited opportunities for discriminating between hot  distant and cool  closer galaxies on the grounds of their far - ir / submm colours even with an assumed _ lt _ relation . with an _ lt _ dispersion of at least 25per cent ( fig.13 ) , the fractional accuracy of a photometric redshift determination is never likely to be better than 30per cent .",
    "current evidence thus suggests that spectroscopic redshifts will remain essential to interpret the nature of submm - selected galaxies , unless increased sample sizes reveal that the existing samples of high - redshift dusty galaxies are scattered by a larger amount in the _ lt _ plane than the true distribution , which is currently well determined only at low redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "we think that this is unlikely , and rather that the observed scatter in the distribution will remain the same or grow larger as more information becomes available .",
    "larger samples will provide a better description of the distribution of galaxies in the wings of the _ lt _ distribution , and unearth further examples of rare galaxies like m82 and apm08279 + 5255 , that are not represented in the _ lt _ plane at the current sampling rate .",
    "the greatest change in our understanding of the properties of dusty galaxies will be brought with the launch of _ sirtf _ in 2003 january . with a 0.85-m aperture , and capable of diffraction - limited imaging in far - ir bands at effective wavelengths of 24 , 70 and 160@xmath0 m ,",
    "_ sirtf _ will provide key information on the seds of at least several million galaxies . unlike galaxies detected by _ iras _ , these will extend well beyond a redshift of 1 , and will be located to an accuracy of order 5arcsec . by combining the positions of galaxies detected by _ sirtf _ with spectroscopic redshifts obtained as part of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which is reasonably complete to @xmath79",
    ", it should be possible to obtain sed data for of order 10@xmath80 galaxies with exact redshifts , and thus to determine the form of the _ lt _ relation discussed in fig.14 in much more detail . at that point the accuracy of photometric redshifts based on far - ir colours combined with an _ lt _ relation can be assessed realistically , at least at low to moderate redshifts .    the information can be extended out to higher redshifts by considering optical photometric redshifts , derived reliably from spectral breaks in the sdss data for galaxies too faint / distant to be targeted for sdss spectroscopy . at the same time",
    ", many of the galaxies with known high redshifts shown in fig.14 , which already have some spectral information at far - ir / submm wavelengths , will be targets for _ sirtf_. more information will thus soon be available about their seds . by combining radio observations with several far - ir data points",
    "it should be possible to generate a more accurate _",
    "lt _ relation , and to measure any changes in the far - ir  radio correlation with increasing redshift by the end of _ sirtf _ s mission in approximately 2008 . the true potential for far - ir and submm - wave photometric redshifts",
    "can then be assessed securely .",
    "the reliability of the far - ir  radio correlation can in the meantime be investigated using data for any galaxy with a known redshift that has three accurate flux density measurements , one each at radio , submm and far - ir wavelengths .",
    "we have discussed the description of the seds of dusty galaxies using four different models that are appropriate to describe data that is available at present and is likely to be generated by forthcoming space missions .",
    "one of the parameters in each model always describes the peak frequency of the thermal dust sed ( ` temperature ' ) , while two spectral indices describe the fraction of hot and cold dust : an ` @xmath11 ' and ` @xmath5 ' parameter respectively .",
    "observational data constrains these sed descriptions to within 10per cent accuracy across the full range of interesting wavelengths longer from about 20@xmath0 m to deep in the radio waveband .",
    "it is important to be careful in interpreting the values of dust temperatures , emissivities and masses that are inferred with the values of real physical parameters .",
    "there is a huge degeneracy between temperature and redshift when fitting the sed of a distant galaxy . assuming some link between the luminosity and sed allows this degeneracy to be broken , but a range of available information indicates that this relationship has a very considerable scatter , by up to a factor of 2 . without the knowledge that this _ lt _ relation has a scatter as narrow as the required accuracy of the photometric redshift , continuum far - ir / submm / radio photometric redshifts are almost useless for providing constraints from the data for an individual galaxy .    in order to finally assess their usefulness",
    "it is essential to quantify the _ lt _ relationship accurately , based on a large number of galaxies with known redshifts and well - sampled seds .",
    "this information is not available at present , but will be generated by _",
    "sirtf_. only if the true scatter in the _ lt _ relation turns out to be less than about 20per cent will the photometric redshift technique be useful .",
    "spectroscopic observations to fix the redshifts and seds of dusty galaxies remain essential to understand the population , and it is important to develop new types of spectroscopic instruments that can address these questions , for example wide - band detectors for multiple co emission lines ( bradford et al . in preparation ) .",
