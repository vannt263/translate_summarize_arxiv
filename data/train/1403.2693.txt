    "the semiclassical bloch - boltzmann transport theory , which relies on the existence of well - defined extended `` band '' states that are weakly scattered by impurities and phonons , is known to provide a successful description of charge carrier dynamics in ordinary wide - band semiconductors .",
    "it has been shown in recent years @xcite that such standard paradigm is not appropriate to organic semiconductors , which are more effectively described by taking the strong disorder limit as a starting point .",
    "the reason for this is that even in ultrapure crystalline samples where extrinsic sources of disorder are removed , large thermal molecular motions arise due to the weak van der waals intermolecular binding .",
    "such dynamical fluctuations in molecular positions and orientations strongly scatter the charge carriers , causing a breakdown of the assumptions underlying semiclassical transport.@xcite unlike static disorder , however , dynamical disorder is unable to fully localize the carriers : after a _ transient localization _ regime which extends up to the typical timescale of molecular vibrations , a diffusive behavior is eventually established .",
    "it can be shown that the resulting d.c .",
    "mobility is a decreasing function of temperature , with a power - law behavior which resembles that of semiclassical `` band - like '' carriers .",
    "its modest value , however , at best of the order of a few tens of @xmath0 at room temperature , is there to remind us of the presence of an underlying strong disorder .",
    "a more direct signature of this unconventional transport mechanism is predicted in the a.c .",
    "response of the carriers : associated to the transient localization phenomenon , a peak emerges in the optical conductivity at a frequency related to the amount of molecular disorder , deeply modifying the usual drude response expected for band - like carriers.@xcite all these features  power - law temperature dependence , low values of the mobility and the existence of a localization peak in the optical conductivity  are commonly found in experiments on high - mobility organic semiconductors , giving support to the transient localization scenario for charge transport .",
    "it is our aim here to derive a general phenomenological formula describing the low - frequency optical absorption of charge carriers in disordered systems with localization .",
    "such a formula should be able to provide a theoretically simple description of the transient localization scenario for organic semiconductors , capturing the main features evidenced in recent numerical simulation studies . rather than studying a particular microscopic model , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , we therefore introduce a phenomenological model for the carrier dynamics which yields a closed analytical form for both the d.c .",
    "mobility and optical conductivity .",
    "our model is able to interpolate between the drude - like response of diffusive carriers and the absorption peak expected in the presence of strong anderson localization , and establishes a direct connection between the temperature dependent mobility and the optical conductivity .",
    "we then perform a benchmarking of the phenomenological formula for the optical conductivity by comparing it with a true microscopic calculation of this quantity in a model system @xcite .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the formula derived here can be used to accurately extract the microscopic parameters governing the carrier dynamics , such as the transient localization length and the relevant scattering rates , and to estimate the electron - intermolecular vibration coupling strength and the amount of extrinsic ( i.e. non - thermal ) disorder .",
    "this allows us to analyze quantitatively the optical absorption spectra available in organic fets in the framework of the transient localization scenario . in the conclusive section we briefly",
    "discuss how the present theory can be applied not only to organic semiconductors but also to bad metals and other disordered systems , including organic conductors and carbon nanotubes .    for readers not interested in the formal developments of the theory ,",

    "we start by briefly reviewing a recently developed theoretical framework @xcite based on the kubo formula , that relates the quantum diffusion of electrons and the optical conductivity .",
    "this formalism has been successfully applied to analyze the carrier dynamics in electronic systems where localization effects cause a breakdown of usual boltzmann transport including quasicrystals@xcite , organic semiconductors@xcite , and graphene @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of such formalism is the quantum - mechanical spread @xmath1 of the position operator @xmath2 of an n - electron system , which contains all the information on the electron dynamics over time . in particular , the first and second derivatives of the electronic spread yield respectively the instantaneous diffusivity , @xmath3 and the retarded _ anticommutator _ velocity correlation function , @xmath4 with the initial condition @xmath5 .",
    "following ref.@xcite , once that the time - dependent quantum - mechanical spread or equivalently the anticommutator velocity correlation function are known , the usual commutator correlation function that enters the kubo response theory is obtained by imposing the detailed balance condition.@xcite the real part of the optical conductivity is then obtained as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron charge , @xmath8 is the system volume and @xmath9 . a similar formula has been proposed in ref .",

    "we present a phenomenological ansatz for the correlation function @xmath10 and the quantum diffusion of electrons in organic semiconductors and derive the corresponding optical conductivity lineshape .",
    "the modifications of the formalism which apply to degenerate electron systems are presented in appendix c.      our starting point is the following reference model , that accounts for carrier localization in the limit of strong static disorder ( from now on we shall always refer to the anticommutator velocity correlation function and drop the subscript @xmath12 for simplicity ) : @xmath13 the correlation function in eq .",

    "a recovery of carrier diffusion is expected in the case of dynamical disorder because the time fluctuations of the disorder potential destroy the quantum interferences responsible for carrier localization .",
    "this effect , which occurs on the typical timescale of molecular motions , that we denote @xmath47 , can be included in our phenomenological model in the spirit of the rta by setting : @xmath48 we assume that the inelastic timescale is the longest timescale in the problem , @xmath49 .",
