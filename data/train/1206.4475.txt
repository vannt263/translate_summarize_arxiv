    "rna hairpins are elementary structures found in many macromolecular assemblies .",
    "it is generally accepted that a deeper understanding of their dynamics is a critical step towards the elucidation of many biological processes , like the regulation of gene expression @xcite ; the catalytic activity in many reactions @xcite ; the ligand - binding specificity @xcite ; or the rna folding problem @xcite .",
    "dna and rna hairpins are also appealing model systems for their simplicity as they are amenable to exhaustive studies using a more physically - oriented approach , where theoretical models can be rigorously tested using simulations and experiments @xcite .",
    "many different and complementary biophysical methods have been used to study these structures .",
    "for example , using time - resolved nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy and thermal denaturation experiments , kinetics and thermodynamics of bistable rna molecules were studied @xcite .",
    "recently , a photolabile caged rna was designed to stabilize one ground - state conformation and study the folding kinetics by nmr and cd spectroscopy under different conditions , including mg@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "laser temperature - jump experiments have also been used to characterize the folding kinetics of small rna hairpins at the ns and @xmath2s timescales @xcite . using coarse - grained go - like models , it was predicted that hairpins unfold in an all - or - none process in mechanical experiments @xcite , in agreement with experimental results @xcite .    within the cell ,",
    "many dynamical processes involving transient melting events of dna and rna double strands are driven by the application of localized forces by molecular motors .",
    "therefore , single - molecule experiments are ideal to understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of macromolecules inside cells @xcite . as pointed out by hyeon _",
    "@xcite , force - denaturation using single - molecule experiments are intrinsically different from thermally - induced denaturation : in bulk experiments where the unfolded state is accessed by raising the temperature or lowering the concentration of ions , the unfolded state is a high - entropy state while in mechanical pulling experiments the unfolding process is a transition from a low - entropy state to another low - entropy state .",
    "regions of the free energy landscape normally inaccessible by conventional methods are probed using mechanical experiments .",
    "consequently , pathways and rates of thermally - induced and mechanical unfolding processes are expected to be different .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite we pulled an rna hairpin using optical tweezers @xcite to study the base - pairing thermodynamics , kinetics and mechanical properties at a fixed monovalent condition .",
    "a kinetic analysis was introduced to determine the location of the force - dependent kinetic barrier , the attempt rate , and the free energy of formation of the molecule .",
    "here we performed a systematic study by mechanically pulling the same rna hairpin at different monovalent cation concentrations and also at mixed ionic conditions containing different concentrations of mg@xmath1 cations .",
    "this is important because rnas are highly charged polyanions whose stability strongly depends on solvent ionic conditions @xcite .",
    "despite its biological significance , we have limited information about rna helix stability in mixed monovalent / multivalent ionic conditions @xcite .",
    "in fact , the thermodynamic parameters for secondary structural elements of rnas have only been derived at the fixed standard salt condition of 1 m [ na@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "here we derived numbers such as the persistence length describing the elastic response of ssrna and also the free energy of formation of an rna hairpin at different monovalent and mixed monovalent / mg@xmath1 conditions .",
    "our results are compatible with predictions obtained using the tightly bound ion ( tbi ) model for mixed ion solutions , that treats monovalent ions as ionic background and multivalent ions as responsible from ion - ion correlation effects , and which takes into account only non - sequence - specific electrostatic effects of ions on rna @xcite .",
    "our findings demonstrate the validity of the approximate rule by which the non - specific binding affinity of divalent cations is equal to that of monovalent cations taken around 100 fold concentration for small molecular constructs @xcite .",

    "we can predict the free energy of formation @xmath54 for the rna hairpin at this particular condition using the mfold server @xcite .",
    "we get @xmath77 @xmath78 ( although our experiments were performed at 1050 mm of monovalent salt , we do not expect significant differences by comparing with the prediction at 1000 mm ) . by applying the kinetic method introduced in section 2.5 we can evaluate the kinetic barrier associated to the unfolding reaction @xmath53 and @xmath50 for a given elastic model for the ssrna and find the one for which the theoretical prediction by kramers rate theory ( eq .

    "the ts is located near the loop , whereas at intermediate forces it is located in the stem region @xmath97 ( fig .",

    "the effect of monovalent ion concentration on dna stability has been extensively studied and there is a variety of empirical salt corrections available in the literature @xcite .",
    "there is no general agreement about the accuracy and limitations of use of salt corrections in terms of sequence length and range of salt concentrations @xcite .",
    "recently , we have reported 10 nn salt correction parameters for prediction of dna duplex stability derived from single - molecule experiments @xcite .",
    "however , there is no equivalent study on rna duplexes and the experimental data available for the salt effects on rna duplex stability are limited to short sequences that display a two - state behavior @xcite .",
    "different polyelectrolyte theories try to characterize the interaction between counterions and nucleic acids to study ionic effects to the molecular stability .",
    "the most accepted are mean field theories such as the poison - boltzmann and the counterion condensation theories @xcite .",
    "recently , the tightly bound ion ( tbi ) model has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it incorporates correlation and fluctuation effects for bound ions , and has been extended to treat rna helices under mixed monovalent / divalent salt conditions @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the tbi improves the prediction of the stabilities of rna duplexes smaller than 15 bp @xcite .    here",
    ", we performed a detailed characterization of the effect of monovalent and mixed monovalent / magnesium concentrations on the stability of a rna hairpin containing a stem of 20 bp by mechanically unfolding and folding the molecule using optical tweezers .",
    "the results we have obtained can be very well described by the empirical formulas derived from the tbi model for predicting the stabilities of rna hairpins in monovalent ion and mixed monovalent / mg@xmath1 buffer conditions .",
    "a comparison of the counterion condensation theory @xcite is provided in the supporting material ( section s8 ) , and although an acceptable accuracy is found at monovalent salt conditions , we observe that correlation effects become important in the presence of mg@xmath1 ions and therefore the tbi gives improved predictions .",
    "when a hairpin is melted mechanically the u state is subjected to a tension . in standard optical melting and calorimetric experiments ,",
    "the u state is under zero force .",
    "therefore , to appropriately compare both phenomena , it is necessary to discount the energy required to stretch the single stranded unfolded state in mechanical experiments .",
    "however , we have limited information about the elastic properties of single stranded rna as compared to dna . despite the chemical similarity between both polymers , the rna - specific 2-oh group favors a conformationally restricted c@xmath110 structure @xcite . moreover , in previous single - molecule studies @xcite , the elastic response of a single - stranded poly - u rna was better described by a wlc model rather than by a fjc model . based on these considerations",
    ", we decided to use the numbers derived from single - molecule stretching experiments for the elastic behavior of ssrna molecules ( as explained in section 3.2 ) to appropriately account for the energetic contribution of stretching the ssrna strands during mechanical unfolding .    by applying the kramers rate theory and correctly accounting for the elastic contribution of ssrna stretching",
    "we were able to obtain the free energy of formation of the rna hairpin from pulling experiments done in non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "this allowed us to obtain a large number of trajectories at different ionic conditions in a feasible timescale . in this way",
    ", we obtained the effective barrier of the unfolding reaction as a function of force for different ionic conditions .    the ability of mg@xmath1 ions to stabilize rna structures at much lower concentrations than monovalent ions was recognized almost forty years ago @xcite .",
    "in fact , by plotting the values of the free energies of formation versus salt concentration ( expressed in mm units ) we can collapse data for both types of salt into a single master curve by multiplying [ mg@xmath1 ] by a factor 100 ( fig .",
    "this effect has been previously observed @xcite and can be explained using the counterion condensation theory which account for strong correlations between counterions and polyelectrolytes @xcite . a similarity ( but not a data collapse )",
    "is obtained for the persistence length values of ssrna ( fig .",
    "it can be interpreted as the screening effect of the counterions present in solution : the longer the screening length , the stiffer the molecule .",
    "this equivalence found between the non - specific binding of monovalent and divalent salts with nucleic acids might be useful to develop new biochemical assays in situations where divalent ion - specific interactions could be detrimental @xcite .",
    "as a further step , it would be very interesting to extend this study by mechanically unfolding an rna hairpin containing a mg@xmath1-specific binding site using our experimental setup .",
    "eventually , the energetic contributions of different specific binding sites could be dissected and incorporated into current models of rna structure prediction .",
