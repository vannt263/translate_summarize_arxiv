    "the importance of the study of possible contributors to the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation is indisputable .",
    "the large angular - scale anisotropy is dominated by the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite , where the first order perturbations in the metric tensor give rise to the appearance of temperature fluctuations in the cmbr .",
    "in present paper we focus on the effects of rotational perturbations in a flat frw model filled with a single , incoherent , perfect fluid matter source , and we analyze its contributions to the fluctuations both in the absence and the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "this problem certainly has been studied by several authors before , eg .",
    "@xcite , however none of these works payed too much attention on the possible analytic solutions in the presence of @xmath0 . throughout this paper",
    "we follow a systematic treatment in calculating parallely with vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constant and comparing the obtained results of the calculations . in section ii .",
    "we take a general overlook on the @xmath1 solutions of the perturbed field equations given by sachs & wolfe @xcite , white @xcite and perjs et al .",
    "@xcite , and the rotation tensor . in the presence of the cosmological constant we use the physical time coordinate @xmath2 in the calculations  as the background solution has a closed analytic form only with this time variable  while in the absence of @xmath0 we use the conformal time coordinate @xmath3 . in section iii .",
    "we calculate the contributions of rotational perturbations to the temperature fluctuations due to the sachs ",
    "wolfe effect and analyze the obtained expression .",
    "we also give a recipe in this section , how to calculate the anisotropy power spectra of the temperature fluctuations caused by rotational perturbations . in section iv .",
    ", using the result of present observations , we give an upper estimation for the order of magnitude of the rotations and the corresponding angular velocity at the time of decoupling and today .",
    "in the case of a perfect fluid matter source the einstein equations are @xmath4 with the four velocity @xmath5 of the fluid normalized by @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the pressure , @xmath8 is the energy density and @xmath9 is the einstein tensor .",
    "the line element in a spatially flat frw spacetime with cartesian coordinate system is @xmath10 where @xmath3 is the conformal time coordinate with the definition @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the scale factor and @xmath13 is the minkowski metric with the following signature , @xmath14 here and throughout this paper roman indices run from 0 to 3 , greek indices from 1 to 3 and we employ units such that @xmath15 .    the well - known unperturbed solution of the einstein equations in the case of incoherent matter without cosmological constant is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath18 , the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time and we chose the @xmath19 normalization condition . the also well - known background solution of the field equations for incoherent matter in the case of @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is restricted by the normalization condition of @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter in this section we follow the perturbation method of sachs & wolfe @xcite and white @xcite and we write the perturbed metric @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the metric perturbation .",
    "we use the minkowski metric @xmath13 and its inverse to raise and lower indices of @xmath26 and of other small quantities . in the perturbed spacetime",
    "we choose comoving coordinates , where the four velocity of the fluid and the metric perturbation @xmath27 are @xmath28    the general @xmath1 solution of the perturbed field equations for incoherent matter without cosmological constant is given by sachs & wolfe @xcite and white @xcite , @xmath29 where and throughout this paper comma denotes partial derivative and @xmath30 , @xmath31 are two scalar functions corresponding to the potentials for density perturbations .",
    "the @xmath32 vector function  satisfying the @xmath33 transversality condition  is related to the perturbed rotation ( vorticity ) tensor @xmath34 , see ( [ rot ] ) .",
    "the @xmath35 transverse , trace - free tensor function represents gravitational waves as the solution of the following wave equation : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the standard laplacian defined by @xmath38 , for an arbitrary smooth function @xmath39 .",
    "the general @xmath1 solution of the perturbed field equations for incoherent matter in the case of @xmath40 is given by perjs et al .",
    "@xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 time - dependent amplitudes are the following elliptic integrals , @xmath44 which can be brought to the legendre normal form given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath45 represents gravitational waves analogous to the term containing @xmath35 in ( [ nolsol ] ) .",
    "we note that in eqs.([hab ] ) , ( [ pertl ] ) and ( [ j ] ) the integration functions @xmath46 and @xmath43 are defined with an opposite sign compared to the original results of perjs et al . in @xcite .",
    "this sign convention helps us in the following to show the clear correspondence of the forthcoming results derived parallely from the sachs & wolfe and the @xmath20 solutions .    in the chosen comoving coordinate system ,",
    "the observers move together with the perturbations of the fluid in the perturbed spacetime . using the expression for the four velocity @xmath47 given in ( [ conv ] ) we can calculate the rotation tensor @xmath34 defined by ehlers @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 and the semicolon denotes the covariant derivative with respect to the perturbed metric @xmath24 .",
    "the four velocity @xmath50 is connected to the @xmath51 components of the metric perturbation from which  with the use of the solution of the field equations in the case of vanishing cosmological constant  we have the following expression for @xmath34 @xmath52 repeating the calculations in the case of @xmath20 we have @xmath53 the relations above demonstrate that the perturbed vorticity tensor is completely determined by the @xmath54 integration function .",
    "in present section we calculate the contribution of rotational perturbations to the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation . as a consequence of the sachs  wolfe effect @xcite , the perturbations produce contributions to the temperature fluctuations determined by the following relation @xmath55 with @xmath56 here the vector @xmath57 represents the spatial direction of the light signal as seen by an observer moving together with the fluid and the @xmath58 subscript denotes the instant of time of the emission . applying the following identity for an arbitrary smooth function @xmath59 @xmath60 and calculating only with rotational perturbations ( terms containing @xmath46 in the perturbed solutions ) , ( [ dett1 ] ) can be written in the following general form , @xmath61_0^{\\eta_r-\\eta_e}-\\int_0^{\\eta_r-\\eta_e}\\xi(\\eta ) c_{\\alpha}e^{\\alpha } dw\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] were the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 time dependent amplitudes are the following in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constant respectively : @xmath65    in fig.1 we have plotted the @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 time dependent amplitudes on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the shape of the curves show that the presence of the cosmological constant results only about a @xmath66 factor difference from the single fluid model at each functions .",
    "this means that the fluctuations represented by rotational perturbations in the microwave background are @xmath67 times smaller in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "it is also remarkable that the magnitude of the amplitudes are decreasing exponentially since the time of decoupling , and the present day contributions are negligible comparing to early epochs . except the integrated term in ( [ gf ] ) ",
    "whose contribution is growing in time  the contributions of the first two terms are the difference of their values at the time of decoupling and today .",
    "therefore the dominant parts come from the time of decoupling and  as the present values are many orders of magnitude smaller  these terms produce the only relevant contributions to the temperature fluctuations that could be measured today .     the time dependence of the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 functions in the presence and the absence of @xmath0 .",
    "the subscript @xmath0 denotes the corresponding functions in the model with cosmological constant .",
    "the vertical lines belong to the following events : @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the time of decoupling in the models with and without cosmological constant , while the @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the present age of the universe in the two models respectively . ]    in the remainder of this section we present the recipe of the calculations how to obtain the anisotropy spectra of the fluctuations generated by rotational perturbations . as a first step , following bardeen s covariant formalism , we replace the @xmath75 perturbation function with a single mode of its decomposition into the vector harmonics @xmath76 of the helmholtz equation @xcite @xmath77 where the subscript @xmath78 denotes the wavenumber dependence of the coefficients @xmath79 and @xmath80 the spatial unit vectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 are spanning the plane perpendicular to @xmath83 .    applying this expansion ,",
    "the integrated term in ( [ gf ] ) can be written in the following form in the case of vanishing cosmological constant @xmath84 using the @xmath85 replacement one can evaluate this isw integral in a closed analytic form as follows , @xmath86\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] repeating the calculations in the case of @xmath40 , the integrated term in ( [ gf ] ) takes the following shape @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 the isw(@xmath0 ) integral in ( [ iswl ] ) can not be evaluated analytically thus numerical integration needs to be used .    to be able to obtain the anisotropy power spectra generated by rotational perturbations",
    ", one has to evaluate the following well - known integral @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the anisotropy momenta and @xmath92 is identical with @xmath93 in ( [ gf ] )  in the decomposition by vector harmonics of the helmholtz equation presented above .    as the last step , one has to take the square of the absolute value of @xmath94 given in ( [ gf ] ) . to be able to evaluate the integral expression of @xmath91",
    ", one needs to have information about the spectrum of @xmath95 which might be originated from predictions of models describing the universe before the decoupling era . as an example",
    "this has been modelled by grishchuk in @xcite , where he derives the angular variation of the microwave background radiation from rotational perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin .",
    "as an application we estimate the magnitude of the angular velocity generated by rotational perturbations using the results of present observations of the cmbr fluctuations .",
    "it is well - known from the analysis of recent measurements @xcite that the dipole component of the temperature fluctuations has the largest amplitude with the order of magnitude @xmath96 .",
    "this term certainly contains many contributions , however one of these originates from the effect of rotational perturbations . as we have shown in ( [ gf ] ) this contribution can be generally separated into the following three components : one proportional to @xmath46 , one proportional to @xmath54 and an integrated term proportional also to @xmath46 . since the rotation tensor is completely determined by the @xmath54 function , we must estimate the order of magnitude of the @xmath54 perturbation to be able to obtain the magnitude of the corresponding angular velocity vector @xmath97 . applying the results of present observations of the dipole component , we can make an estimation on the upper bound of the rotations with the following procedure .",
    "the corresponding angular velocity deduced from the vorticity tensor is @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the 3-dimensional totally antisymmetric levi - civita symbol .",
    "having done the calculation for the square root of @xmath101 , we obtain the expression @xmath102^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the @xmath103 time dependent amplitude is the following in the cases of vanishing and nonvanishing cosmological constant respectively , @xmath104    as an upper limit , in accordance with the measurements , we can say that none of the terms in ( [ gf ] ) can be larger than the order of magnitude @xmath105 , so this must also be valid for the @xmath54 term . in the previous section we have shown that the relevant contribution of this term comes from its value at the time of decoupling , where the magnitude of its time dependent amplitude @xmath106 is known .",
    "this makes the restriction to @xmath54 that its order of magnitude can not be larger than @xmath107 .",
    "if we assume that the first derivative @xmath108 has the same order of magnitude , we can make the estimation for @xmath109 in ( [ kappa ] ) that is @xmath110 . applying this assumption",
    "we obtain the following order of magnitudes for the values of the angular velocity at the time of decoupling and today in the presence and the absence of @xmath0 :    @xmath111    it shows that the presence of the cosmological constant does nt change the order of magnitude of the angular velocity , however in a more accurate calculation there might be a multiplying factor @xmath112 between the two models similar to the results obtained for @xmath94 in the previous section .",
    "the present value of @xmath113 can be associated with the rotation of the universe , and the obtained order of magnitudes are in good agreement with the results of @xcite , where the estimated value for the ratio @xmath114 in a flat model .",
    "we have considered the effects of rotational perturbations of frw models on the cosmic microwave background radiation and its connection to the amplitude of the rotation of the universe .",
    "we presented the general form of the relative temperature fluctuations induced by rotations and obtained analytic expressions for all the time dependent coefficients arising both in the presence and the absence of a cosmological constant .",
    "it is found that the @xmath62 and @xmath63 transfer functions of the rotational sachs ",
    "wolfe effect , and the @xmath64 weighing function of the rotational integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect are decaying exponentially , and there is a @xmath66 factor between their values in the models with zero and nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "we presented the general method of calculating the anisotropy power spectra of the rotational isw term , and using the results of recent observations for the dipole component of the microwave background , we made an upper estimation for the magnitude of the rotation of the universe at the time of decoupling and today .",
    "it is a remarkable result that the value of the corresponding angular velocity at the time of decoupling is close to the order of magnitude of the angular velocity of a typical galaxy cluster today @xcite .",
