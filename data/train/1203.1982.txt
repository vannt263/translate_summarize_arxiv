    "the ground state of the system will be a quasi-1d crystal.@xcite thus , the properties of the fqh state in an anisotropic interaction may not always be associated with the isotropic incompressible liquid .",

    "the background in the structure factor resembles that of an anisotropic laughlin liquid , but its peak value is significantly smaller than the two sharp peaks along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the cdw twin peaks correspond to a period in real space , which can be roughly anticipated as the splitting of zeros @xmath82 at the critical @xmath83 . the peak value ( subtracting background ) in the structure factor suffices as the order parameter .",

    "[ sqstar](d ) shows that this cdw - like order parameter rules the system in the regime @xmath84 .",

    "[ ] the transition from the laughlin liquid to the hall smectic can be second order and its critical behavior is in the @xmath86 universality class .    beyond @xmath37 , the reverse trend in the excitation gap as a function of @xmath5 indicates that the system is under the influence of a distinct mechanism .",

    "the crystal order dominates as illustrated in fig .",

    "a similar story has been discussed in an isotropic fqh system with extreme geometry , such as in a thin torus or a cylinder limit,@xcite and in a recent work @xcite on the graphene ribbon with flat bands .",
    "they can be explained under the same principle in ref .  [ ] by sorting hamiltonian . when the interaction anisotropy increases , the repulsion - related diagonal terms dominate , which has the similar effect as geometry on the isotropic fqh and as the local orbital expansion on the flat - band graphene ribbon .",
    "the low - energy physics is governed by the strong repulsion so that the system tends to form crystal . at small anisotropy ,",
    "the hopping - related off - diagonal terms are comparable and screen the repulsion , resulting in the liquid phase .      in the discussion above",
