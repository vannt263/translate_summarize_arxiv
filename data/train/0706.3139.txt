    "generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) are a versatile tool to quantify important aspects of hadron structure in qcd .",
    "they contain unique information on the spatial distribution of partons @xcite and on the orbital angular momentum they carry in the proton @xcite .",
    "the theoretically cleanest process where gpds can be studied is deeply virtual compton scattering ( similar to inclusive dis , which plays a dominant role in constraining the usual parton densities ) .",
    "hard exclusive meson production is harder to describe quantitatively , but it provides opportunities to obtain important complementary constraints . in particular , vector meson production is more directly sensitive to the gluon distributions , which enter the compton amplitude only at next - to - leading ( nlo ) order in @xmath1 .",
    "together with a wealth of high - quality data @xcite , this warrants efforts to bring meson production under theoretical control as much as possible .    in the present contribution",
    "@xcite we investigate exclusive @xmath2 production ( @xmath3 ) using collinear factorization , which is applicable in the limit of large photon virtuality @xmath4 at fixed bjorken variable @xmath0 and fixed invariant momentum transfer @xmath5 to the proton @xcite . in practical terms , this means that the description is restricted to sufficiently large @xmath4 but can be used for both small and large @xmath0 , thus providing a common framework for analyzing both collider and fixed - target data .",
    "the process amplitude can then be expressed in terms of gpds for the proton , the @xmath6 distribution amplitude for the @xmath2 , and hard - scattering kernels .",
    "the kernels are known to nlo , i.e.  to order @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the requirement of `` sufficiently large '' @xmath4 is demanding for meson production .",
    "contributions that are formally suppressed by powers of @xmath8 can not be calculated in a completely systematic way , but the estimates @xcite agree that for @xmath4 of several @xmath9 the effect of the transverse quark momentum inside the meson can not be neglected in the hard - scattering subprocess , as it is done in the collinear approximation .",
    "this effect can be incorporated in the modified hard - scattering picture @xcite , in color dipole models @xcite , or in the mrt approach @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation of @xmath1 corrections remains not only a technical but even a conceptual challenge in these approaches , so that the perturbative stability of their results can not be investigated at present .",
    "one strategy in this situation is to study the nlo corrections in the collinear factorization framework , identifying kinematical regions where they are moderate or small .",
    "there one may use formulations incorporating power corrections from transverse quark momentum with greater confidence .",
    "this is the aim of the present contribution .    in the following",
    "we show results for the convolution of the unpolarized quark and gluon gpds @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the corresponding hard - scattering kernels and the asymptotic form of the @xmath2 distribution amplitude .",
    "we model the gpds using a standard ansatz based on double distributions @xcite , with the cteq6 m distributions as input .",
    "unless indicated explicitly , we take @xmath12 and set the factorization and renormalization scales equal , @xmath13 .",
    "imaginary part of the convolution integral for the sum of gluon and quark singlet distributions as a function of the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath14.,title=\"fig : \" ]   imaginary part of the convolution integral for the sum of gluon and quark singlet distributions as a function of the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath14.,title=\"fig : \" ]    r0.5        in a wide kinematical range at small @xmath0 , we find huge nlo corrections which have opposite sign to the born term and almost cancel it .",
    "this is shown for @xmath15 in fig .",
    "[ fig : small - x ] , where there are indications for an onset of perturbative stability at @xmath16 , but not yet at @xmath17 . taking",
    "@xmath18 one finds no stability even at @xmath19 , whereas for @xmath20 the corrections are of tolerable size already at @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zeus ] shows that in kinematics relevant for hera measurements , nlo corrections have a huge effect on the cross section and moreover lead to a flat energy behavior in conflict with experiment . due to the strong cancellations between lo and nlo terms ,",
    "the dependence on factorization and renormalization scale is not reduced when going to nlo .    as already observed in @xcite the large size of nlo corrections at small @xmath0",
    "can be traced back to bfkl - type logarithms appearing first at nlo for vector meson production .",
    "such logarithms are present in many processes ( including dis ) but have a rather large numerical prefactor in the present case .",
    "it is to be hoped that all - order resummation of these logarithms in the hard - scattering kernel will give perturbative stability at small @xmath0 .    in the @xmath0 range relevant for experiments at compass , hermes , and jlab",
    ", we generally find corrections which are sizable but not huge .",
    "an exception is the real part of the gluon and quark singlet amplitudes , where corrections become large for decreasing @xmath0 , as is seen in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : large - x ] .",

    "the blm procedure for setting the renormalization scale aims at resumming these to all orders in @xmath1 .",
    "applied to the process at hand , one finds however that this requires @xmath22 to be typically an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this is outside the validity of the perturbative calculation for most practically relevant @xmath23 .",
