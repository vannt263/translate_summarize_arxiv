    "since the discovery of high temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , the pairing mechanism and the symmetry of the order parameter in these compounds are key questions at stake @xcite .",
    "there are several experimental techniques which are able to address this problem . the experiments on quasiparticle tunneling @xcite , the linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth @xcite",
    ", the nmr and nqr measurements @xcite , and angular resolved photoemission experiments in bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath9 @xcite have yielded results consistent with @xmath10-wave pairing . on the other hand , quasiparticle tunneling ,",
    "the exponential temperature dependence of the penetration depth , as well as the measurements of the electronic raman scattering in nd@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath13 are consistent with s - wave pairing @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the magnetic field dependence of the dc - squid ( ybacuo - au - pb arrangement ) @xcite clearly indicated d - wave behavior , while the experiments on single josephson - junction pb - ybco @xcite showed s - type behavior .",
    "so while the experimental evidence in favor of d - wave symmetry of the order parameter continuously grows , there is still no final consensus about it .",
    "raman scattering is a powerful tool to address the problem of the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "it allows to probe the symmetry of the scattering tensor by simply choosing different polarization directions of the incident and scattered light . from the investigations of the raman scattering in conventional superconductors",
    "it is known that the superconducting transition manifests itself in a renormalization of the electronic raman scattering intensity below t@xmath2 .",
    "it was found for nb@xmath3sn and v@xmath3si @xcite that normalized raman spectra of these compounds show for temperatures below t@xmath2 a peak associated with the pair breaking process at the energy 2@xmath14 , together with a strong decrease of the scattering intensity at frequencies lower than 2@xmath14 . in high temperature superconductors , the first measurements of electronic raman scattering were reported in refs .. but in this case the behavior of the electronic scattering differs from that in conventional superconductors : a pair breaking peak develops in the spectra below t@xmath2 , but the scattering intensity at frequencies below 2@xmath14 does not show the usual sharp decrease . instead , a monotonic decrease toward zero frequency is found .",
    "moreover , for different symmetry components ( a@xmath5 , b@xmath5 and b@xmath15 ) the renormalization of the scattering intensity for t@xmath16t@xmath2 is different and they exhibit peaks at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "these facts have been explained by devereaux et al .",
    "@xcite in terms of d@xmath17-wave pairing .",
    "their calculations of the scattering cross - section have been performed for a cylindrical single - sheeted fermi surface in the framework of the kinetic equation approach .",
    "the symmetry of the crystal was taken into account through calculating the raman vertex , which was expanded in terms of a complete set of crystal harmonics defined on the fermi surface .",
    "it was found that nontrivial coupling between the raman vertex and an assumed strongly anisotropic energy gap leads to the strong symmetry dependence of the scattering intensity .",
    "the calculations @xcite predict specific symmetry dependencies of the low frequency scattering as well as the peak positions for the different symmetry components of the electronic raman scattering at temperatures below t@xmath2 .",
    "the a@xmath5 peak position is sensitive to the parameters of the model calculation .",
    "it will appear below b@xmath5 peak position while with some parameters it may also appear at the b@xmath5 peak position .",
    "nevertheless there is one set of parameters which can perfectly reproduce the experimental data@xcite . later on this model",
    "was criticized by krantz and cardona @xcite .",
    "their calculations @xcite are based on the general description of the raman scattering cross - section through the inverse effective mass tensor . in case of the multisheeted fermi surface,(e.g .",
    "several cuo@xmath0 planes per unit cell in htsc ) polarization dependent raman efficiencies are determined by the averages of the corresponding effective mass fluctuations .",
    "the authors of ref . used the effective masses from lda band structure calculations for yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath18 to determine the raman scattering cross - section .",
    "they found that it contradicts the experimental results if one uses only d - wave pairing for a multisheeted fermi surface of yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath18 .",
    "an explanation was given by assuming different types of the order parameter on different sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "for a single - sheeted fermi surface ( i.e. one cuo@xmath0-plane per unit cell ) no mass fluctuations should occur .",
    "therefore in the framework of the effective mass fluctuation approach , the a@xmath5 scattering component will be nearly totally screened and should peak at the same position where the b@xmath5 scattering component ( 2@xmath19 ) .",
    "therefore straihgtforward measurements of the electronic raman scattering in single - cuo@xmath0 layered high - temperature superconductors ( tl-2201 , la-214 , bi-2201 , ( nd , ce)-214 ) should clarifay this controversial point .",
    "tl-2201 has the highest t@xmath2 ( up to 110k ) @xcite among the above mentioned single - cuo@xmath0 layered compounds .",
    "therefore all effects due to the gap opening are expected in the range of 300 - 600@xmath6 , and they should not be obscured due to the rayleigh scattering at small wavenumbers . nevertheless , raman measurements in only one pure scattering geometry ( b@xmath5 ) are known @xcite for this compound , which showed @xcite becides a t@xmath2=80k two additional transitions at 100 and 125k , which can be indicative of the tl-2212 and tl-2223 phases .",
    "these facts lead us to reinvestigate the electronic raman scattering in the tl - based high temperature superconductor tl-2201 ( with different oxygen content ) with one cuo@xmath0-plane per unit cell .",
    "the comparison with the results of electronic raman scattering experiments reported for the high temperature superconductors with several cuo@xmath0-planes should clarify whether the multiband scattering is indeed important . we should mention that similar experiments on the single layered compound ( la-214 ) were already carried out @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in the framework of comparison of the compounds with different number of cuo@xmath0-planes the measurements on tl-2201 are more favourable due to its high t@xmath2 .",
    "the investigated single crystals of tl@xmath0ba@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ( tl-2201 ) had the shape of rectangular platelets with the size of approximately 2x2x0.2 mm@xmath20 .",
    "the two crystals investigated were characterized by a squid magnetometer .",
    "t@xmath2 was found to be 90@xmath213 k and 80@xmath215 k. the crystals are slightly underdoped .",
    "it is known @xcite that differences in t@xmath2 in tl-2201 compound originate from different oxygen concentrations .",
    "these crystals can be over- as well as underdoped .",
    "the heavily oxygen doped crystals show a metallic type of conductivity @xcite and do not show a superconducting transition .",
    "the orientation of the tetragonal crystals was controlled by x - ray diffraction .",
    "raman measurements were performed on `` as grown '' surfaces of the freshly prepared crystals .",
    "this is very important , because the crystal surface of tl - based superconductors as well as of all high temperature superconductors is very sensitive to long exposure to air and especially to humid atmosphere . for",
    "the raman measurements a dilor xy triple spectrometer combined with a nitrogen cooled ccd detector was used .",
    "all raman data were obtained at nearly backscattering geometry .",
    "the photon excitation was provided by the 488-nm line of an ar@xmath22 ion laser with laser power equal to 15w/@xmath23 .",
    "the estimated additional heating did not exceed 5k .",
    "all measurements were performed with the polarization of the incident and scattered light parallel to the basal plane of the crystal , i.e. the cuo@xmath0-planes .",
    "it was possible to measure the a@xmath5 , b@xmath5 , and b@xmath15 symmetry components of the raman scattering cross - section .",
    "in addition to the previously published phonon peaks ( @xmath24123@xmath6 , @xmath24169@xmath6 , @xmath24490@xmath6 , @xmath25@xmath6 , @xmath24610@xmath6 ) @xcite we have detected some additional phonons ( @xmath24240@xmath6 , @xmath24300@xmath6 , @xmath24330@xmath6 , @xmath26@xmath6 ) which we believe are the defect induced infrared active phonons . for all scattering geometries the spectra for temperatures well below t@xmath2 were divided by the spectra just above t@xmath2 in order to emphasize the redistribution of the scattering intensity in the superconducting state compared to the normal state .",
    "the results of the electronic raman scattering in the crystals of tl-2201 ( t@xmath2=80k,90k ) are shown on figs .",
    "[ f1]-[f5 ] . in the crystal with t@xmath2=80k",

    "the x and y axes are rotated by 45@xmath27 with respect to the crystal x and y axes , respectively , which are parallel to the crystallographic axes . the b@xmath15 scattering component in fig .",
    "[ f1]b is less intense , but shows also a broad maximum with an average frequency of 380@xmath2135@xmath6 .",

    "[ f2]a and b , showing spectra of a@xmath5 + b@xmath15 and a@xmath5 + b@xmath5 scattering components , respectively . in order to evaluate the a@xmath5 scattering component we subtracted the b@xmath5 and b@xmath15 components ( see fig .",
    "[ f1]a , b ) from the xx and xx spectra , respectively . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ f3]a , b the a@xmath5 scattering component peaks in both cases , at 345@xmath2120@xmath6 . for the crystal with t@xmath2=90k we found peaks of the b@xmath5 , a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components at 460@xmath2115@xmath6 , 350@xmath2120@xmath6 , and 400@xmath2135@xmath6 , respectively ( fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "another very important observation is that the low frequency behavior of the electronic raman scattering exhibits strong anisotropy with respect to the symmetry components .",
    "one can see in fig.4a ( upper and lower panel ) that the intensity decrease of the b@xmath5 scattering component toward lower frequencies fits the @xmath28 law predicted by devereaux et al .",
    "for the a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components in fig .",
    "[ f4]b and c , respectively , there is a linear decrease , which also agrees with the predictions by deveraux et al .",
    "a summary of our results on tl-2201 is presented in table [ t1 ] .    in order to follow the temperature behavior of the superconductor gap ,",
    "we have measured the temperature dependence of the electronic raman scattering .",
    "following devereaux et .",
    "al.@xcite , we assume that the peak in the b@xmath5 component of the electronic scattering corresponds to the value of 2@xmath19 . in fig .",
    "[ f5]a and b , respectively , we show the b@xmath5 and a@xmath5 scattering component of tl-2201 ( t@xmath2=80k ) at different temperatures between 10k and t@xmath2 divided by the spectrum at 100k .",
    "the experiments for the 90-k crystal yielded a similar behavior .    with increasing temperature the intensity of the peak in fig .",
    "[ f5]a associated with the pair breaking process decreases and the maximum shifts slightly to lower frequencies .",
    "obviously , the temperature dependence of the superconductor gap does not follow the bcs behavior .",
    "in other words , upon cooling below t@xmath2 the gap opens more abruptly than predicted by bcs theory .",
    "these results are similar to results reported for underdoped bi-2212 @xcite . because the peak position of the a@xmath5 scattering component in fig .",
    "[ f5]b has larger error bars compared to the b@xmath5 component , one can not definitely say whether the data fit the bcs behavior or not .",
    "we also searched for superconductivity - induced changes in frequency and linewidth of the optical phonons . with the resolution of 1@xmath6 we have not observed such changes . upon heating from 10k up to 200k the frequencies of all phonons decreased and the linewidths increased monotonically .",
    "the raman scattering intensity can be written in terms of the differential scattering cross section@xcite : @xmath29 with @xmath30\\im m\\chi_{\\gamma\\gamma}(\\vec{q},\\omega)\\ ] ] here r@xmath31 is the thomson radius , @xmath32 is the frequency of incident ( scattered ) photon , @xmath33 and k@xmath34 were set to 1 .",
    "s@xmath35 is the generalized structure function , which is connected to the imaginary part of the raman response function @xmath36 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ; @xmath37 $ ] is the bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "the raman response function can be written as @xcite : @xmath38 with the raman vertex @xmath39 written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 are either brillouin zone or fermi surface harmonics @xcite which transform according to point group transformations of the crystal and @xmath42 is the tsuneto function : @xmath43 the brackets @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ rares ] denote an average of the momentum @xmath45 over the fermi surface .    as is obvious , raman scattering probes only @xmath46 .",
    "therfore it is not possible to determine whether the gap function changes sign for different directions of @xmath47 or not .",
    "but nevertheless the symmetry of the gap function can be inferred from the specific spectral features of each symmetry component of the electronic raman scattering .    for the gap of d - wave symmetry ( @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is an angle between @xmath45 and the a - axis ) , calculations @xcite predict different low frequency behavior for the different symmetry components .",
    "for b@xmath15 and a@xmath5 scattering components it should show a linear dependence in @xmath50 , but for b@xmath5 it should be @xmath51 .",
    "the appearance of a power law in the low frequency scattering characterizes an energy gap which vanishes on lines on the fermi surface .",
    "an appearance of @xmath28 law in b@xmath5 scattering component is specific for d@xmath17-wave pairing @xcite .",
    "the predicted values of the peak maxima for the b@xmath5 , b@xmath15 and a@xmath5 scattering components are @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . these above mentioned peculiarities appear in our data .",
    "indeed , the low frequency behavior of the b@xmath5 scattering component definitely differs from a linear behavior as seen in fig .",
    "[ f4]a , whereas for the a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components it is linear in @xmath50 ( see fig .",
    "[ f4]b , c ) . for both crystals , the b@xmath5 scattering component peaks at a higher frequency than the b@xmath15 , which in turn peaks at a higher frequency than the a@xmath5 component .    since raman scattering",
    "does not probe the phase of the order parameter it is important to take into consideration other types of the pairing which can also have nodes on the fermi surface , but do not change the sign , i.e. @xmath55-pairing , or strongly anisotropic s - pairing . for the @xmath55-pairing @xcite @xmath56 one gets the threshold at @xmath57 ( minimum pair breaking energy ) .",
    "while a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components exhibit a jump at this frequency , the b@xmath5 scattering component shows a continuous rise from zero and up to the peak at @xmath58 .",
    "the a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components also show broad maxima as in the case of pure d@xmath17-wave pairing , but these maxima will be cut - off toward lower frequencies due to the strong jump at 2@xmath59 . thus one should observe a low - frequency cutt - off in both a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components , which , however , is not observed in our data .    for anisotropic s - pairing , showing the minimum of the gap on the diagonals of the two - dimensional brillouin zone , ( @xmath60 ) one",
    "gets a single threshold on 2@xmath61 for all scattering components as well as a peak at @xmath62 for the b@xmath5 scattering component .",
    "therefore we will expect a picture which is very similar to the case of @xmath55-pairing , with one exception .",
    "the b@xmath5 scattering component should show an additional shoulder at the same position where the a@xmath5 and b@xmath15 scattering components show peaks @xcite .",
    "this is also not the case for our data . in principle",
    "one can assume @xmath61 to be very small or even zero .",
    "in this case one gets peaks at 2@xmath19 , 0.6@xmath19 and 0.2@xmath19 for the b@xmath5 , b@xmath15 and a@xmath5 scattering components @xcite , respectively . in addition",
    ", the low frequency behavior of the b@xmath5 scattering component will be linear .",
    "this also contradicts our results .",
    "recently the model calculations of devereaux et al . were criticized by krantz and cardona @xcite .",
    "the main argument against this theoretical model is that the realistic electronic band structure of the crystal is important , but that the one - sheeted fermi surface approximation used by devereaux et al.@xcite is inappropriate .",
    "the authors of ref . used a numerical model based on the lda band structure calculations for ybacuo in order to take into account the multisheeted fermi surface of the superconductors with several cuo@xmath0 -planes .",
    "it was pointed out that for the @xmath63 ( d - wave pairing ) and a multisheeted fermi surface the calculations lead to a contradiction with the experiment , i.e. the a@xmath5 and b@xmath5 scattering components peak at the same position 2@xmath61 . in order to get consistency with the experiment ,",
    "different types of the order parameter on different sheets of the fermi surface were proposed . only in this case the calculations in ref . were able to get different positions of the maxima of the b@xmath5 , a@xmath5 , and b@xmath15 scattering components . for a one - sheeted fermi surface the authors of ref . found identical positions of the maxima for the a@xmath5 and b@xmath5 components , but a different position for the b@xmath15 component .",
    "hence it was concluded that any difference in peak position of the a@xmath5 and b@xmath5 component is only consistent with multiband scattering of a multisheeted fermi surface and different gap symmetries for each of the sheets . for superconductors with one cuo@xmath0-plane",
    ", a multisheeted fermi surface is invoked originating from tl - like s - states @xcite ( tl-2201 ) or from sr - doping@xcite ( la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 ) in order to yield a difference in peak position for the a@xmath5 and b@xmath5 components .",
    "however , no experimental proof for such a fermi surface contribution exists so far .",
    "moreover , the calculations in ref . failed in explaining of the symmetry - dependent low - frequency dependence of the raman scattering intensity , whereas this important experimental fact was observed not only in our experiments , but also in bi - sr - ca - cu - o @xcite , y - ba - cu - o@xcite and la - sr - cu - o @xcite systems .",
    "in addition , it is obvious that all superconductors with different crystal structures have a different electronic structure . hence , if the multiband scattering model would be crucial we would expect absolutely different behavior for the different superconductors which is actually in contradiction with existing experimental results .",
    "even if one compares the superconductors with the same number of cuo@xmath0 planes , one finds that , while the interplanar distance ( distance between cu atoms in different cuo@xmath0-planes ) is quite similar , the dimpling ( in - plane cu - o - cu angle ) differs very much from compound to compound ( see table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "yba@xmath0cu@xmath3o@xmath18 exhibits the largest dimpling compared to other compounds .",
    "strong dimpling should lift the degeneracy of otherwise identical cuo@xmath0-planes or fermi surface sheets .",
    "this dimpling can strongly affect the lda calculations because the interplanar interaction should depend on this parameter .",
    "and finally on top of that , use of the effective mass approach is very much questionable in case of high temperature superconductors , because this approach can be used only for nonresonant raman scattering @xcite . in high temperature superconductors",
    "we , however , are always in the regime of the resonant scattering . moreover ,",
    "the electron correlation effects in htsc are not treated sufficiently by lda .",
    "in contrast to the conclusion of ref .",
    "our experiments show that the one - cuo@xmath0-plane compound tl-2201 shows very similar behavior compared to compounds with several cuo@xmath0-planes , such as tl-2223 , bi-2212 and ybacuo @xcite .",
    "we also found that the frequency of the b@xmath5 maximum scales with t@xmath2 , and it corresponds to the value 2@xmath64 .",
    "this value is very close to the values ( with the exception of nd@xmath11ce@xmath12cuo@xmath13 @xcite ) found for other high temperature superconductors as shown in table [ t3 ] .",
    "the temperature dependence of the gap ( b@xmath5 component in fig .",
    "[ f5]a ) in our experiment differs from the bcs behavior , i.e. upon cooling the gap opens more abruptly than predicted by bcs theory .",
    "this is consistent with the spin fluctuation theory of high temperature superconductivity @xcite , favoring d@xmath17-wave pairing .",
    "the model considers pair binding as well as pair breaking effects due to the spin fluctuations .",
    "gap opening leads to a suppression of low - frequency spin fluctuations and therefore to reduced pair - breaking . therefore in underdoped crystals ( we consider our tl-2201 crystals as underdoped ) this effect will lead to a more abrupt opening of the gap upon cooling below t@xmath2 compared to bcs behavior .    in conclusion , we presented measurements of the electronic raman scattering on high - t@xmath2 tl-2201 single crystals with one cuo@xmath0-plane per unit cell .",
    "the peculiarities of the electronic raman scattering , i.e. the power law frequency dependence of the diferent scattering components at low frequencies , their different peak positions as well as the values of 2@xmath64 are found to be very similar in compounds with one and several cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "all nearly optimally doped high - t@xmath2 superconductors ( with the exception of ( nd , ce)-214 @xcite ) show a very similar behavior of the electronic raman scattering consistent with the d@xmath17- wave symmetry of the underlying order parameter .",
