    "et al_.  @xcitehave reported the observation of strongly type ii superconductivity in cu@xmath8bi@xmath3se@xmath4 below 3.8 k when cu is intercalated between the bi@xmath3se@xmath4 layers.they have also proposed to use cu@xmath8bi@xmath3se@xmath4 as a mean to induce superconducting correlations for the trs topological surface states by the proximity effect .",
    "the surface states in a @xmath9 trs topological band insulator are reminiscent of the bloch states of graphene in that , in both cases , their density of states vanishes linearly at the so - called rashba - dirac point .",
    "@xcite however , they differ in a fundamental way from those in graphene . for example",
    ", the surface of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 supports one rashba - dirac cone as opposed to two in graphene .",
    "this difference is a manifestation of the fact that inversion symmetry is maximally broken on the surface of bi@xmath3se@xmath4 in that the kinetic energy is dominantly of the rashba type , whereas the spin - orbit coupling is for all intent and purposes negligible for graphene .",
    "consequently , the surface states of a 3d trs topological band insulator are not localized by weak trs disorder ,  @xcite@xmath10@xcite whereas anderson localization rules in graphene .",
    "@xcite    another difference with graphene , as we shall show in this paper as a warm up , is that all states in the rashba - dirac sea contribute to the pauli magnetic susceptibility , which is anisotropic in that the in - plane and out - of - plane components differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "for comparison , the pauli magnetic susceptibility is isotropic in spin space and proportional to the density of states at the fermi surface in any electron gas ( including graphene ) with small breaking of the spin - rotation symmetry ( srs ) .",
    "this anisotropy and the fact that the pauli susceptibility does not only depend on the density of states at the fermi level could potentially be used as a simple diagnostic of a limit in which the rashba coupling is the largest energy scale .",
    "the main emphasis of this paper will be on the superconducting instabilities of the surface states in a 3d trs topological band insulator and on those in close relatives , i.e. , two - dimensional ( 2d ) trs noncentrosymmetric superconductors in a regime that has been little studied so far .",
    "the theoretical studies of noncentrosymmetric superconductors with trs usually assume the hierarchy of energy scales @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the inversion - symmetric band width , @xmath13 is the spin - orbit coupling that preserves trs but breaks srs , and @xmath14 is the single - particle superconducting gap .",
    "@xcite@xmath15@xcite the regime @xmath16 is the one that applies to intrinsic superconducting instabilities of the surface states in a 3d trs topological band insulator .",
    "we will address the question of whether interesting phenomena associated to superconductivity occur upon exchanging the hierarchies ( [ eq : hierarchy a ] ) and ( [ eq : hierarchy b ] ) .",
    "in the same way that ( 2d ) trs band insulators have been classified according to their topological character,@xcite@xmath15@xcite bogoliubov - de - gennes ( bdg ) superconductors have also been given topological attributes whenever they support gapless boundary states in confined geometries .",
    "@xcite@xmath15@xcite a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a 2d trs superconductor to be topologically non - trivial is that it is noncentrosymmetric , or , equivalently , that it breaks srs .",
    "according to refs .",
    "and , a sufficient condition is that , for any weak and local trs static disorder , a 2d trs superconductor in an infinitely long strip geometry supports an odd number of kramers doublets of gapless edge states of which at least one wave function is extended along the edge ( see also refs .  - for varying alternative criteria ) .    applying this definition of a topological superconducting phase to the superconducting instabilities of surface states in a 3d trs",
    "topological band insulator immediately leads to a paradox : what is the meaning of the boundary of a boundary ?",
    "a more meaningful question to ask might be : what are the spectral properties of trs - breaking vortices if the surface states in a 3d trs topological band insulator support a type ii superconducting order ?",
    "do they bind mid gap states generically , zero modes in particular , or not ?",
    "these are questions that we address in this paper .",
    "defects in a type ii superconductor are vortices .",
    "on the one hand , caroli _",
    "et al_.  @xcitehave shown that vortices in an @xmath0-wave trs and srs superconductor bind nonvanishing - energy bound states with a mean level spacing of the order of the superconducting gap squared divided by the fermi energy.on the other hand , jackiw and rossi in ref .   found a single bound state that is exponentially localized around the core of a unit - flux vortex in a 2d @xmath0-wave relativistic superconductor with a vanishing density of states ( rashba - dirac point ) .",
    "the energy of this bound state is precisely pinned to the fermi energy ( see also ref .   for the corresponding index theorem and refs .   and for examples of nonrelativistic zero modes bound to vortices ) .",
    "a midgap state bound to the core of a vortex does not carry an electric charge , for it is an eigenstate of the generator of the particle - hole symmetry ( phs ) obeyed by any bdg hamiltonian . it is thus charge neutral and as such is a physical realization of a majorana fermion .",
    "majorana fermions were also found to be exponentially localized to the core of a vortex in a @xmath17 type ii superconductor by read and green and by ivanov in refs .   and , respectively .",
    "more importantly , they showed that these majorana fermions obey non - abelian braiding statistics .",
    "theoretical proposals to nucleate majorana fermions have been made relying on 2d trs noncentrosymmetric superconductors , @xcite or on proximity effects at the 2d interface between band insulators , superconductors , and ferromagnets .",
    "@xcite    we will show in this paper that , when the dispersion is rashba - dirac like , there is a single zero mode bound to the core of an isolated vortex with unit circulation , and thus a single majorana bound state .",
    "the mechanism , in the case of singlet pairing , is precisely that of jackiw and rossi .",
    "@xcite this zero mode remains for arbitrary ratios of triplet and singlet pairing , with the pairing potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , and also as the chemical potential @xmath20 is varied .",
    "the stability of a singly degenerate zero mode is guaranteed in a system with particle - hole symmetry in which the zero mode is isolated from the continuous spectrum by a finite energy gap .",
    "therefore , studying gap - closing surfaces in the parameter space of the coupling constants characterizing the theory is of crucial importance in identifying the stability of the majorana modes as well as the phase boundaries between different topological phases .    in this paper , we compute the conditions for the closing of the gap in space by exploring a one - to - one mapping to the normal - state dispersion relation , in which a function of the ratio @xmath21 serves as a reparameterization of the magnitude of the momenta in the dispersion relation .",
    "thereto , we show that there are as many lines in space at which the gap closes as there are branches in the dispersion relation .",
    "but in the case of the rashba - dirac dispersion , it is possible to go from one side of a gap vanishing line to another without crossing it by going through the point at infinity ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "thus , there are not two distinct phases separated by a transition in this case , but there is a single phase instead .    in the fermi limit relevant to 2d trs noncentrosymmetric superconductors , we find that the conditions for the closing of the spectral gap do separate two gapful phases .",
    "these two regimes are those in which either the singlet or the triplet pairing controls the physics .",
    "the detailed shape of the phase boundaries is dictated by the normal - state dispersion relation .",
    "the presence of the trs spin - orbit coupling leads to interesting effects at certain values of the chemical potential , for example , re - entrance to the phase dominated by singlet - pairing physics even when @xmath23 is large .",
    "we find two majorana zero modes bound to an isolated vortex in the triplet controlled phase but they disappear in the singlet controlled phase .",
    "we find that the vortices that bind this pair of majorana zero modes have unit flux , as opposed to the half - vortices needed in the case of two - dimensional @xmath2 superconductors that break time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the physical reason for this difference is that , when trs holds , the spin - resolved pairing amplitudes @xmath24 and @xmath25 are not independent , and thus one can not introduce vorticity in one but not the other , which is the case for the half vortices in the @xmath2 superconductors .",
    "therefore the pair of majorana fermions that we find for full vortices in the triplet case is distinct from those found by read and green  @xcite and ivanov .",
    "@xcite the pair of majorana fermions that we find is not robust to a generic weak perturbation that breaks translation invariance , for these majorana fermions are not related to each other by the operation of time reversal .",
    "this pair of majorana fermions is thus unrelated to the one introduced by qi _ _ et al .",
    "_ _ in ref .   as a mean to identify the triplet dominated trs phase as a nontrivial 2d @xmath26 topological superconducting phase .",
    "we conclude that , although both superconducting regimes can be distinguished by the even number of majorana fermions that an isolated trs - breaking vortex binds , this distinction is not topological , for it is not robust to static disorder , for example .",
    "in addition to this interesting interplay between the singlet and triplet pair potentials for the existence of majorana fermions , superconductivity for surface states in a 3d trs topological band insulator and noncentrosymmetric materials has other curious properties , one of which is the following . because spin is not a good quantum number , even if the pair potential contains , say , only the singlet component , the condensate will nevertheless have triplet correlations .",
    "for example , the pairing correlation for electrons @xmath27 ( and @xmath28 as well ) for @xmath29 , even if @xmath30 .",
    "one measurable consequence is that , generically , these superconducting states would lead to detectable josephson currents when connected to either conventional @xmath0-wave or @xmath1-wave superconductors , manifesting the fact that they have both types of correlations ( even if only the singlet pair potential @xmath19 is nonzero ) .",
