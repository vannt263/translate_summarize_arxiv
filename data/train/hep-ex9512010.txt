    "<S> we have observed highly virtual ( @xmath0 ) photon - photon collisions to hadronic final states at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated luminosity of the data sample was 241pb@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> both scattered beam - electrons and scattered beam - positrons were detected using low - angle calorimeters ( i.e. , both photons were highly virtual ,  </S>",
    "<S> double - tag \" ) ; we obtained 115 hadronic events with an estimated background of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section obtained was @xmath4pb in the @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev region , while the lowest order quark - parton model predicted 3.00pb .    </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the total hadronic cross section in highly virtual photon - photon collisions ( @xmath7 ) is reported for center - of - mass energy , @xmath8 , between 2 and 25 gev . in this experiment both the scattered @xmath9 and @xmath10 , refered as tags , were detected . </S>",
    "<S> such a technique is called  double - tag \" @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the range of photon four - momentum squared , @xmath11 , for this experiment was -1.05 to -37 gev@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 s and @xmath8 were detected on an event - by - event basis directly from the tags . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical calculation of such events in which two large scales of virtuality exist , does not rely on any high @xmath13 selection in the hadronic final state . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement thus amounts to a first measurement of a well defined total hadronic cross section in which there could be minimal sensitivity to qcd cut - offs </S>",
    "<S> .    examples of feynman diagrams which contribute to @xmath14 collisions are shown in figures [ feynman ] ( a)-(e ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ feynman ] ( a ) is called multi - peripheral or  direct process \" which is expected to be dominant in these events @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figures 1 ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) are examples of a bremsstrahlung , conversion , and annihilation diagram . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 ( e ) is an example of  resolved photon process \" which is considered to be a smaller contribution in highly virtual photon - photon collisions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the statistics and virtualities of the photons of the experimental data are the highest compared with previous experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the integrated luminosity of the event sample is 241pb@xmath2 at @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the details concerning the topaz detector at tristan can be found in reference @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> to select virtual photon - photon collision events , we used a pair of low - angle calorimeters ( fcl ) made of bismuth germanate crystals ( bgo ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this covered the polar - angle region of 3.2 to 12 degrees with respect to the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution was measured to be 5% for bhabha electrons , and 3% for 4-gev electron beams . </S>",
    "<S> we required that both of the fcl s ( electron and positron sides ) had single clusters of energies greater than @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> this cut was determined in order to reduce contributions from the resolved - photon process @xcite and initial ( final ) state radiation in various processes . </S>",
    "<S> it also helped us to reject any background from spent electrons in the accelerator beams . under these conditions the virtuality of the photon ( @xmath18 ) was ensured to be greater than 1.05 gev@xmath12 .    the trigger system for the topaz detector consisted of neutral and charged - track triggers . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for the neutral triggers were as follows : ( a ) the total energy deposited in a barrel calorimeter ( bcl , made of lead - glass ) or an endcap calorimeter ( ecl , made of pb - streamer - tube sandwiches ) must be greater than 2 or 4 ( 63% of the events were taken with a 2-gev threshold of the bcl , and the others with a 4-gev threshold . ) and 10 gev , respectively ; ( b ) the bcl was segmented into three parts and the ecl into 4 parts . for energy deposits in these parts , 1 gev ( for bcl ) and 4 gev ( for ecl ) thresholds were set . any two hits caused trigger signals . </S>",
    "<S> the charged - track trigger required at least two tracks from the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13 of each track was required to be greater than 0.3@xmath190.7 gev ( run dependent ) , and the opening angle between one of the pairs must be greater than 45@xmath1990 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the cut values depended on the beam conditions ; their variation throughout the data taking were taken into account in monte - carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the details can be found in reference @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we used a time - projection - chamber ( tpc ) , the bcl , and the ecl in event selection . </S>",
    "<S> detailed analyses of these detectors can be found in reference @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we required at least three charged tracks from the origin with a @xmath13 greater than 0.15 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the invariant mass ( @xmath20 ) of the visible particles ( in the tpc and bcl ) had to be greater than 2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> here , the energy threshold of the bcl neutral clusters had to be greater than 100 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the visible energy in this region had to be less than 25 gev .    in order to reduce the backgrounds from annihilation events which were produced at low angle </S>",
    "<S> , we required that the energy flow into the ecl be less than that into the bcl .    the material thickness in front of the tpc was @xmath190.3 radiation length . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we had to pay special attention to @xmath21 . using de / dx measurements from the tpc we identified electron tracks in the events . to reject this process , we required that an event must contain at least two non - electron tracks .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we obtained a total of 115 events . </S>",
    "<S> we investigated three sources of background : ( a ) beam - gas and accidental coincidences by spent electrons , ( b ) @xmath22 , and ( c ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a lepton .    * </S>",
    "<S> \\(a ) using the bhabha - scattering events in the central region of the detector , as well as random triggered events , we estimated the background level of the accidental hits in the fcl . </S>",
    "<S> the accidental rate was measured to be less than 0.1% . </S>",
    "<S> the contamination of the beam - gas scattering was estimated by using off - vertex events in the experimental sample . </S>",
    "<S> it was estimated to be 1.0@xmath250.7 events . * </S>",
    "<S> \\(b ) the koralz generator was used to simulate the initial ( isr ) and final ( fsr ) state radiation with multiple @xmath26 s @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , the maximum energy ( @xmath27 ) of the radiated photon was set at 0.97@xmath17 for b - quark events and 0.99@xmath17 for the other quarks . the next - to - leading order ( @xmath28 ) </S>",
    "<S> correction and hadronization was carried out using jetset 6.3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contamination of this process was estimated to be 2.3@xmath250.7 events . </S>",
    "<S> * \\(c ) the fermisv generator was used to simulate this process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this generator could also simulate isr and fsr . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 was set at 0.8@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the contamination was estimated to be 6.9@xmath250.6 events ; @xmath29-pair events dominantly contributed ( @xmath30 events ) .    in total , </S>",
    "<S> the background contamination in this sample was estimated to be @xmath3 events . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus obtained a clean sample of direct photon - photon collision events .    </S>",
    "<S> the average of smaller and larger @xmath31 s of two photons of this event sample were 5.1 and 12.3 gev@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> both are equally highly virtual . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the differential cross sections of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath32 at several @xmath33 cuts , where @xmath34 was a minimum of two @xmath35 detected by the forward and backward fcl counters . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section such as @xmath36 or photon structure function would be a future subject in which we need more statistics and works . </S>",
    "<S> we used the fermisv code for deriving the acceptance correction factors with our detector simulation codes . </S>",
    "<S> we again set @xmath37 for isr and fsr in fermisv . </S>",
    "<S> we restricted events with all four fermions in the final state having polar angles greater than 2.5 degrees from the beam axis . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum invariant masses for hadronic system were set to 2 gev for light quark events , 2@xmath38 for c , and 2@xmath39 for b , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the cosines of scattered electrons ( positrons ) were required to be within @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> quark masses used were 0.35 gev for u , d , 0.5 gev for s , 1.35 gev for c , and 4.5 gev for b. the hadronization process was simulated using jetset 6.3 string fragmentation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained cross sections are shown in table [ tcross ] for various kinematic ranges . </S>",
    "<S> also shown are the ratios between the experimental and theoretical cross sections and the t - ratios which are the ratio between @xmath41 , where only the multi - peripheral diagram is taken into account in calculating @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> radiative corrections were carried out in deriving these values . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section obtained was @xmath4pb in the @xmath5 gev and @xmath43 gev region , while the lowest order ( lo ) theory predicted by femisv is @xmath44pb . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fcross ] shows the ratios between the experimental and lo - theoretical cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> observed distributions such as @xmath20 and number of charged tracks were consistent with the monte - carlo prediction within statistical errors except for overall normalizations . on the other hand , the experimental data agreed with the theoretical predictions at high @xmath35 , including overall normalization factors . </S>",
    "<S> the errors shown are both statistical and systematic . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the systematic errors below .    </S>",
    "<S> the systematic errors were estimated separately concerning the fcl , trigger , and event selection .    </S>",
    "<S> * fcl : we changed the energy threshold in the clustering algorithm , as well as that in electron tagging . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the acceptance was compared with a monte - carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> also , background contamination was studied by comparing it with bhabha and random - triggered events . the systematic error due to the fcl </S>",
    "<S> was estimated to be 5.2% . * </S>",
    "<S> trigger : we added noise hits in the tracking detector to the monte - carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we also studied the acceptance dependence on the energy thresholds of the neutral triggers . </S>",
    "<S> the error was estimated to be 6.0% based on the ambiguity in the hardware settings ( 10% ) . </S>",
    "<S> * event selection : we changed the cut values and derived the cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the differences were taken into account as errors ( 4.9% ) . * </S>",
    "<S> hadronization : we used jetset 6.3 for hadronization of @xmath45 system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we changes parameters of string fragmentation @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the ranges 0.4 - 0.7 gev@xmath48 and 0.35 - 0.45 gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the acceptance differences were taken into account as systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> their bin - to - bin average was 8.9% .    </S>",
    "<S> an error of integrated luminosity was estimated to be 4% . </S>",
    "<S> the errors except for luminosity and trigger were derived by a bin - by - bin bases . </S>",
    "<S> for example a luminosity error is common for all bins , i.e. , correlates positively . </S>",
    "<S> the correlated systematic error was estimated to be 7.2% . </S>",
    "<S> the average bin - by - bin systematic errors was estimated to be 13.5% . </S>",
    "<S> the first errors quoted in table [ tcross ] are statistical and the second ones are systematic . </S>",
    "<S> the errors in figure [ fcross ] are quadric sums of these errors .    </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the fcl energy measurements is important for determining @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the fcl energy was originally calibrated at 4 gev using ar electron beams at kek and at 29 gev by the bhabha - scattering electrons . in order to check the other energy region </S>",
    "<S> , we studied radiative bhabha events . </S>",
    "<S> we selected acoplanar bhabha events where the radiated @xmath26 direction was consistent with the fcl fiducial volume . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the bcl - predicted and the fcl - measured energies was as expected from our monte - carlo simulation . </S>",
    "<S> the monte - carlo simulation predicted that the @xmath32 resolution would be almost constant ( @xmath193 gev ) in the observed energy region ( @xmath5 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> this was better than the @xmath20 determined from the tpc and bcl .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we have observed highly virtual ( @xmath0 ) photon - photon collisions to hadronic final states at @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated luminosity of the data sample was 241pb@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the beam electrons ( positrons ) were tagged by low - angle calorimeters ; we obtained @xmath49 events in the 2 @xmath50 25 gev and @xmath512 gev region , the monte - carlo with lo theory predicted @xmath52 events where the errors are statistical . in this new kinematic region the contribution of the lo @xmath45 diagram is expected to dominate . with systematic errors </S>",
    "<S> included , the ratio between experimental and theoretical data becomes 1.48@xmath250.26 . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections were measured to be @xmath4pb in the region where @xmath53 and 2 @xmath54 .    </S>",
