    "these mid - infrared sources were furthermore found to have particularly red colors while the associated scuba cores were found to have high `` concentrations '' , i.e. , appear centrally peaked . determining whether this result is a discriminant of the earliest stage of star formation in general , or whether it is region specific , requires exploring additional clouds .",

    "that is , for sources without counterparts at one or more wavelengths , those mosaics were reexamined and a best attempt made to extract a source .",
    "however , for detection purposes sources are potentially suspect : for example outflow knots close to embedded protostars are easily picked up toward the psf wings of the mips  24  @xmath2 m detections of embedded ysos and we therefore exclude them in the remainder of the analysis .",
    "another addition to the c2d processing , is bandmerging with observations at 70  @xmath2 m . in this paper , we include sources that are either detected at 24  @xmath2 m ( excluding band - filled sources ) or 70  @xmath2 m as the basis for the analysis ( in the following we refer to those sources as `` mips sources '' ) .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite where only the 24  @xmath2 m catalogs were utilized .",
    "as we return to below , this procedure solves the problem that some well - known ysos are saturated at 24@xmath2 m , an issue which was dealt with in @xcite by including scuba cores with high concentrations .      using this first cut of mips 24",
    "@xmath2 m detected sources we can also address the issue of background contamination : one of the complications in large scale mappings such as those presented in c2d is separating background contamination from the sample of candidate ysos in an accurate statistical manner .",

    "this translates to a 1.5% chance of having a mips  24  @xmath2 m source randomly aligned within a 15@xmath3 radius ( one scuba half - power beam - width ) of the center a given scuba core ( or put in another way , statistically there will be 1 randomly assigned candidate in total within 15@xmath3 of the 66 scuba cores in ophiuchus ) .",

    "the numbers are 1.5 and 0.53 , respectively .",
    "that is , the number of red sources in scuba cores is about a factor 3.54 higher in perseus than ophiuchus .",
    "furthermore , in perseus , sources with significantly redder colors are found : 10 sources are found with @xmath8-[4.5 ] > 2.5 $ ] with a maximum of 4.4 whereas none this red are found in ophiuchus .",
    "this difference between the redness of the embedded sources in perseus vs. ophiuchus may suggest a difference in their physical properties ( see  [ physorigin ] ) .    to establish samples of embedded ysos we utilize these results to apply the same procedure @xcite used on the perseus datasets . in this paper",
    "we refer to embedded ysos as any mips source ( i.e. , a source detected at either 24 or 70  @xmath2 m ) which is associated with a submillimeter core as traced by emission in the scuba maps or which fulfills certain color criteria ( see below ) .",
    "neither the mid - infrared source lists nor the submillimeter core identifications by themselves can be used unambiguously to define a sample of embedded objects , but as demonstrated in @xcite they can be used in conjunction to form a relatively unbiased list of ysos complete down to the resolution of the mid - infrared data .",
    "the three criteria developed for identifying candidate protostars in perseus were based on the mid - infrared colors of spitzer sources , associations between spitzer sources and submillimeter cores and the concentration , where @xmath10 is the beam size , @xmath11 the total flux from the scuba observations at 850  @xmath2 m , @xmath12 the measured radius and @xmath13 the peak flux @xcite . ] of scuba cores .",
    "in summary the list of embedded objects were constructed by selecting :    a. : :    mips 24  @xmath2 m catalog sources with    @xmath8-[4.5 ] > 1 $ ] and @xmath9-[24 ] > 4.5 $ ] , _ or _",
    "b. : :    mips 24  @xmath2 m catalog sources with distances less than 15    to their nearest submillimeter core , _ or _",
    "c. : :    submillimeter cores with concentrations higher than 0.6 .",
    "the first criterion selects the most deeply embedded ysos with steeply increasing seds but misses sources that are not detected in irac bands 1 or 2 - either due to confusion with outflows or simply because they in fact are very deeply embedded .",
    "the second criterion selects all mips sources that are embedded ysos in the sense that they are located within two scuba beam sizes of a scuba core . that list will also include sources which are not necessarily directly associated with an observed submillimeter core due to confusion in the submillimeter map , poorly defined core structure , or the limiting sensitivity of the submillimeter observations . in perseus",
    "it was found that most of the sources selected according to the second criterion also obeyed the first ( upper panels of fig .",
    "[ inverse_12 ] and [ inverse_45 ] ) .",
    "these first two criteria were found to still miss sources saturated at 24  @xmath2 m .",
    "such sources were selected by the third criterion , which did not in itself include all the mid - infrared sources under * a * and * b * ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand it was also shown that a number of low concentration cores in fact had embedded ysos , so criterion * c * in itself was also not optimal for picking out candidate embedded ysos .",
    "in contrast to perseus , there are a few cores with high concentrations ( @xmath14 ) in ophiuchus that in fact are starless . as well",
    ", a few sources associated with lower concentration cores are found to be saturated at 24  @xmath2 m and therefore would not make it onto the list of protostars .",
    "visual inspection of all scuba cores , however , reveals that by adding sources that are detected at 70  @xmath2 m , provides a sample of all the mips sources in ophiuchus associated with scuba cores , even those clearly saturated or confused at 24  @xmath2 m .",
    "this method can also be directly applied to perseus : the four sources that were associated with high concentration cores all only have 70  @xmath2 m detections , whereas no new sources are added by utilizing this criterion in perseus . in this way there is no need to rely on the observed empirical properties of the scuba cores .",
    "therefore , the two criteria required to identify candidate protostars in this paper in either perseus or ophiuchus are :    a. : :    mips 24 or 70  @xmath2 m catalog sources with    @xmath8-[4.5 ] > 1 $ ] and @xmath9-[24 ] > 4.5 $ ] , _ or _",
    "b. : :    mips 24 or 70  @xmath2 m catalog sources with distances less    than 15  to their nearest core .    in this way a sample of 27 embedded ysos are identified : the majority 24 ( 89% ) because they are within 15  of a scuba core ( criterion * b * ) . ] with the remaining three sources due to their @xmath8-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath9-[24]$ ] colors ( criterion * a * ) .",
    "table  [ embeddedysolist ] summarizes the sample of candidate embedded ysos in ophiuchus .",
    "one core , smm  j162626 - 24243 , is associated with two ysos ( gds j162625.6 - 242429 and vla  1623 ) within 15@xmath3 of its center , although at least one other , smm  j162622 - 24225 , is associated with mulitple ysos ( the gss30-irs1 , -irs2 , -irs3 system ) where only one is picked up as a separate mips 24  @xmath2 m source .",
    "this is similar to the analysis from perseus where only few scuba cores were found to be associated with multiple mips sources @xcite .",
    "it is here worth emphasizing that the resolution of the mips observations is only about 6@xmath3 ( 750  au ) and these numbers should therefore not be taken as statements concerning the close binarity of the embedded ysos .    of the 27 embedded ysos ,",
    "16 were also identified as yso candidates using the criteria used by c2d to extract ysos based on their mid - infrared colors ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the remaining 11 were not .",
    "this illustrates the need for the combination of mid - infrared and submillimeter data when constructing samples of deeply embedded protostars - as it was also concluded based on the analysis of the perseus data @xcite .",
    "an important finding of @xcite was that all cores with concentrations higher than 0.6 had mips sources within 15@xmath3 .",
    "[ conc_histo ] compares the distributions of the concentrations of the scuba cores with and without embedded mips sources in perseus and ophiuchus .",
    "the two distributions are quite different : in perseus the concentrations of the cores show a very broad distribution with a number of high concentration cores whereas the ophiuchus distribution shows a pronounced peak at concentrations @xmath15 . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that protostellar cores should have higher concentrations than pre - stellar , simply because of the heating of the dust from the center .",
    "therefore based on the scuba data alone we should expect fewer embedded protostars in ophiuchus relative to perseus .",
    "this is directly confirmed by comparing the number of scuba cores with mips sources within 15@xmath3 in the two clouds .",
    "ophiuchus has embedded ysos in only 23 out of the 66 scuba cores while perseus has embedded ysos in 42 out of the 72 scuba cores .",
    "further , as discussed in  [ disksources ] some of the sources in ophiuchus are actually disk sources and not deeply embedded .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the ophiuchus scuba cores is the existence of four high concentration cores without embedded ysos .",
    "the four cores in ophiuchus are in fact starless as shown in fig .",
    "[ corenoyso ] .",
    "three of these cores are located in the oph  a ridge , which has previously been the subject of detailed studies at ( sub)millimeter wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spitzer observations confirm that the the ridge itself actually appears to be starless but with protostars ( e.g. , vla  1623 and gss  30 ) located in its immediate vicinity . @xcite ( and likewise @xcite ) found that the cores in the oph  a ridge were within a factor two of being in virial equilibrium .",
    "therefore the high concentrations of the cores in the ridge most likely reflect the extreme local pressure due to the surrounding environment .",
    "@xcite found that the millimeter cores in the northern part of the ridge had a high dust temperature of @xmath16  k , likely due to heating by the nearby b - star [ and clearly heating the dust seen at 24  @xmath2 m also ( lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ corenoyso ] ) ] .",
    "the fourth high concentration starless core , iras  16293e , is a well - studied submillimeter companion to the iras source iras  16293 - 2422 and also has no counterparts at 24  @xmath2 m or 70  @xmath2 m ( fig .",
    "[ corenoyso ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that iras  16293e was a deeply embedded , or `` class 0 '' @xcite , protostar based on the detection of an outflow inferred from hco@xmath17 .",
    "@xcite presented larger scale maps and showed that this was not the case , rather the outflowing motions suggested for iras  16293e by @xcite were a result of the larger scale outflow driven by iras  16293 - 2422b fanning around iras  16293e .",
    "the spitzer images indeed confirm that the iras  16293 - 2422 outflow extends eastwards of iras  16293e ( fig .",
    "[ i16293_outflow ] ) .",
    "the absence of a central heating source in iras  16293e is also consistent with the fact that iras  16293e shows strong n@xmath18h@xmath17 emission relative to the protostellar source in iras  16293 - 2422 itself as reported by @xcite .",
    "n@xmath18h@xmath17 is found to be prominent in starless cores with low temperatures where co has frozen out on dust grains and thus unavailable to destroy n@xmath18h@xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , the conditions within protostellar cores heat a significant part of the envelope to temperatures where co is released into the gas - phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is likely that the submillimeter core iras  16293e is affected by the coincident outflow , e.g. , compression and heating possibly increasing its concentration .",
    "the most obvious limitation in the direct comparison between perseus and ophiuchus is the factor of two difference in distance between the two clouds ( perseus at 250  pc ; ophiuchus at 125  pc )  pc to this cloud whereas distance estimates for perseus range from about 220  pc to 350  pc ( see @xcite for a discussion ) . ] .",
    "since the scuba and spitzer surveys are observed to the same absolute depth for each cloud , we would expect intrinsically weaker sources to be detected in ophiuchus .",
    "for example , if we assume that each of the scuba cores are isothermal at 15  k the typical 5@xmath5 sensitivity of 0.15  jy  beam@xmath4 in the scuba maps corresponds to total masses within the 15@xmath3 arcsecond beam ( dust+gas ) of 0.08 and 0.02  @xmath0 in perseus and ophiuchus , respectively .",
    "since many of the scuba cores are barely resolved by only a few beams , resolution might affect the derived physical properties .",
    "the factor of two better spatial resolution in ophiuchus therefore challenges comparisons between the physical properties of the two clouds .",
    "additionally , given the gregarious nature of the submillimeter cores , nearby neighbors will be merged into larger entities in the perseus cloud . to address both these issues we simulated the case where the scuba map of ophiuchus was observed at the distance of perseus :",
    "the ophiuchus scuba maps were convolved with a beam twice the size of the regular scuba beam and the map re - sampled to affect the spatial and pixel resolution of perseus . furthermore",
    ", the observed brightness was reduced by a factor four , corresponding to the further distance .",
    "the clumpfind algorithm was then applied to this new map to identify substructures .",
    "[ conc_change ] compares the peak fluxes and concentrations of the scuba cores in the original map with the ones in the map simulated at twice the distance .",
    "as expected the number of cores decreases when the cloud is moved to a larger distance : the lower s / n causes the smallest cores to be missed and the larger cores have their sizes reduced , since their boundaries in clumpfind are defined by the contour at an absolute flux level . although the total number of cores thereby decreases , the relative distribution of core sizes remains the same as some of the closest cores , e.g. , in the oph  a ridge , are merged into larger cores . for the cores with high fluxes the concentration appears to be largely unchanged .",
    "for the fainter cores , the cores with the highest concentrations are more likely disappearing as their peaks drop below the detection threshold .",
    "the lower concentration faint cores in contrast have a better chance of survival as their faint emission is more evenly distributed and the convolution just moves emission from larger scales into the central beam .",
    "finally , the concentration of the cores formed by a merger of multiple cores tends to be similar to the highest concentration core merged . taken together",
    ", these effects will bias against low flux , high concentration sources at larger distances , i.e. , typically more evolved sources such as embedded objects with lower mass envelopes or disks .",
    "the scuba maps of ophiuchus are therefore expected to reveal more sources than perseus although these will generally be less massive and smaller .",
    "this is indeed seen when comparing the list for perseus @xcite with that from ophiuchus from this paper : the median core radius is 7000  au ( 28@xmath3 ) in perseus vs. 3875  au ( 31@xmath3 ) in ophiuchus and likewise the median core mass 0.90  @xmath0 in perseus vs. 0.44  @xmath0 in ophiuchus .    since",
    ", the criteria for associating a mips source with a scuba core is based on its distance on angular and not linear scale , a natural question is whether we instead ought to increase the radius from 15@xmath3 to 30@xmath3 for associations according to our second criterion , `` * b * '' .",
    "table  [ distantsources ] summarize the sources separated 15@xmath330@xmath3 from a scuba core .",
    "the numbers in themselves argue that these are not a significant population of embedded ysos : only 9 mips sources are found in this separation range compared to the 24 within 15@xmath3 of the center of a scuba core ( the latter covering a factor 3 smaller area ) .",
    "none of these sources have red colors fullfilling our `` * a * '' criterion or are associated with well - studied , embedded protostars . on the other hand , it is also not reasonable to decrease the size scale in which scuba cores are associated with mips sources in perseus - given the intrinsic uncertainty in the pointing of the submillimeter data ( a few arcseconds ) and the size of the jcmt / scuba beam ( 15 ) . that most of the red mips sources in fact fall within this radius ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ inverse_12]-[inverse_45 ] ) and @xcite ) suggests that most of scatter seen in this diagram is due to the instrumental limitations and that the distribution in fact is even tighter ( typical separations @xmath195 - 10@xmath3 ) .",
    "an important , and somewhat subtle , effect is that the distance difference also skews the interpretation of the embedded protostellar sources - compared to the pre - stellar cores .",
    "the dust continuum maps measure the optically thin emission from dust , weighted by the temperature within the scuba beam .",
    "for an optically thin envelope the temperature dependence on radius , @xmath20 is : @xmath21 where @xmath22 depends on the slope of the dust opacity law @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in more convenient units at a radius corresponding to the 15@xmath3 size of the scuba beam for ism dust with @xmath24 eq .",
    "[ e : chandlertemp1 ] becomes : @xmath25 a protostellar envelope will therefore have a dust temperature which increases in the central scuba beam as it is brought nearer ( 25% higher if the distance to the source is halved ) and it will brighten significantly ( by about 50% at half the distance ) .",
    "this , however , is not the case for the starless cores which are close to isothermal ( or actually decreasing in temperature toward their centers ) as the actual temperature measured in the scuba beam is not varying with radius . we should therefore expect to have an easier task detecting protostellar cores in ophiuchus relative to perseus - or correspondingly , be sensitive to even lower masses of envelopes in ophiuchus relative to perseus .",
    "this will bias the results in a relative sense towards a situation with fewer low - mass protostellar sources compared to pre - stellar cores in the more distant cloud , i.e. , perseus .",
    "the improved sensitivity in the nearer cloud will also cause circumstellar disks to start `` contaminating '' our sample . @xcite",
    "surveyed a sample of isolated sources in taurus with scuba , including a number of well - known classical t - tauri stars , or `` class ii '' @xcite , ysos .",
    "they found that 35% of those more evolved sources had fluxes larger than 100  mjy ( about the 3@xmath5 sensitivity limit of our scuba maps ) whereas less than 10% had fluxes",

    "the scuba core also appears unresolved , consistent with it being submillimeter emission from a compact disk .",
    "this illustrates that the `` abc classification scheme '' should be taken as a gradation of the likely embeddedness of a given source : the more criteria passed for a given source , the greater likelihood that source is embedded .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the mips 24  @xmath2 m images of ophiuchus show large swatches of variable brightness extended emission across the cloud .",
    "in particular , @xcite draw attention to significant dark patches where up to 80% of the extended background emission is absorbed ( their fig .",
    "recently @xcite analyzed spitzer images of a similar shadow of the bok globule cb  190 .",
    "[ shadows ] compare the 24  @xmath2 m images to scuba continuum maps for four cores seen across the field .",
    "the resemblance between the shape of the core absorption shadows at 24  @xmath2 m and their emission profiles at 850  @xmath2 m illustrate ( 1 ) the good correspondence between the resolution at these two wavelengths ( 6@xmath3 at 24  @xmath2 m and 15@xmath3 at 850  @xmath2 m ) and ( 2 ) that these cores contain very dense material .",
    "a decrease in flux by 80% corresponds to an optical depth of the 24  @xmath2 m shadow of 1.6 or a visual extinction @xmath29 under the same assumptions as @xcite and assuming that the cores are in the foreground to the extended emission . in reality",
    "both zodiacal light and foreground emission ( i.e. , emission from cloud material in which the core is embedded ) may contribute to the observed profile - and the derived extinction is therefore a lower limit to the actual extinction toward the core profiles .",
    "for comparison , for a temperature of 10  k the typical scuba peak 850  @xmath2 m fluxes of these cores of 0.20.8  jy  beam@xmath4 correspond to an extinction of @xmath30 averaged over the 15@xmath3 scuba beam .",
    "as discussed by , e.g. , @xcite , the spitzer data provides large samples of ysos that can be classified in the traditional scheme for the evolution based on their spectral indices at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is calculated in the c2d catalogs from a least square fit to the observations from 2.2 to 24  @xmath2 m . following @xcite , class i sources have @xmath33 , `` flat spectrum '' sources @xmath34 and class ii sources @xmath35 . ] .",
    "this scheme does not directly capture differences within the group of embedded sources which are typically classified into `` class 0 '' and `` class i '' according to their submillimeter signatures ( see discussion in   [ physorigin ] ) , e.g. , their submillimeter relative to total luminosities .",
    "such a distinction therefore requires fully sampled seds as presented , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "still , since we expect almost all class 0 sources to be detected at 24  @xmath2 m and these sources per definition are associated with submillimeter cores , our sample of embedded ysos is expected to be complete with respect to these sources . for the remainder of this section we therefore use the term `` class  i '' in the sense of the @xmath31-classification scheme which thereby also encompass the more deeply embedded sources .",
    "the distribution of the more evolved ysos identified by the spitzer data ( e.g. , `` flat spectrum '' , class  ii ) compared to the scuba cores provides insight into the dynamical properties of star formation .",
    "table  [ dissipation ] lists the number of ysos in each class for both perseus and ophiuchus from the classification given in the catalogs from the final delivery of c2d data @xcite and gives the fraction which are located within 15@xmath3 and 30@xmath3 of a scuba core relative to the total number of ysos within the area covered by scuba .",
    "the fraction of embedded ysos associated with submillimeter cores are clearly decreasing from more than half to less than a few percent in the class  ii stages .",
    "the numbers suggest both that class  ii sources are genuine envelope - less sources and that about 4050% of the class  i sources do not have envelopes more massive than the sensitivity limit of the scuba survey , i.e. , about 0.1  @xmath0 .",
    "this is further illustrated in fig .",
    "[ classinosubmm ] , which shows the @xmath8-[4.5]$ ] vs. @xmath9-[24]$ ] color - color diagrams for ophiuchus and perseus . in both diagrams",
    "the evolved yso population based on their @xmath31 ( `` flat spectrum '' , class ii and class iii ) has been separated from the class i sources .",
    "the latter group has furthermore been divided into class i sources that are or are not within 15@xmath3 from the center of a scuba core .",
    "[ classinosubmm ] shows that the class i sources in perseus that are not associated with a scuba core are located close to the more evolved population of ysos in this diagram , i.e. , typically have less red colors than those that do lie within 15@xmath3 of a core .",
    "this again suggests that these sources are more evolved and although they may be associated with envelopes providing their increasing seds in the mid - infrared , those envelopes have masses smaller than the sensitivity limit of the scuba survey . on the other hand , the population of red sources associated with scuba cores seen prominently in the perseus panel is absent in the ophiuchus panel , arguing in favor of the more evolved / less embedded nature of the class i sources in ophiuchus .",
    "naturally per definition most ( 89% ) of the sources in the sample constructed in this paper ( table  [ embeddedysolist ] ) are associated with scuba cores with the few exceptions being red sources in region of crowded submillimeter emission .",
    "this sample is expected to contain both class 0 and i protostellar sources .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the decrease in fraction of sources associated with submillimeter cores in the later yso classes can be interpreted in two ways : either the envelopes around the embedded sources dissipate over the duration of the class i stage or the ysos themselves disperse ( i.e. , move away from their parental cores through their evolution ) . however , although the number of red ysos in ophiuchus is lower than in perseus these are still strongly clustered within 15@xmath3 (  [ midirsubmm ] and fig .",
    "[ clustplot ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite this in itself suggests that very little dispersal of the ysos take place during their evolution through their embedded stages .",
    "in fact , this is likely to be expected given the required escape velocity from centers of the scuba cores : the median mass of @xmath360.44  @xmath0 and radius of @xmath3731@xmath3 ( 3875  au ) of the cores from table  [ submmtab ] corresponds to an escape speed from the center of a constant density core to infinity , @xmath38 , of 0.5  km  s@xmath4 - about 5 times the sound speed in a molecular cloud with a temperature of 1015  k. as the density profile of the scuba cores are centrally condensed ( and the escape velocity thus higher ) it therefore shows that highly supersonic motions would be required at the birth of the central protostar in order for it to escape its parental core during the embedded protostellar stages .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , on large scales the perseus and ophiuchus clouds are highly non - uniform .",
    "significant star formation occurs in well - defined regions , e.g. , the two main clusters , ic  348 and ngc  1333 , of perseus or l1688 in ophiuchus . on the other hand significant star formation was also found to occur outside of these clusters in perseus , e.g. , in the smaller groups surrounding b1 , l1448 and l1455 .",
    "[ regioncompare ] compares the distribution of red mips sources around the cores in ngc  1333 , ic  348 and the rest of the cloud ( using the distinction between the two clusters and the remainder of perseus from @xcite ) .",
    "as seen in this figure the `` extended '' region which predominantly covers scuba cores in the smaller groups , b1 , l1448 and l1455 , shows the most concentrated distribution of ysos around the center of the scuba cores whereas ic  348 in the other extreme shows the most loose distribution of ysos .",
    "this in itself suggests that the smaller groups are still in the early star forming stages , whereas the region around ic  348 predominantly contains more evolved ysos that are no longer associated with scuba cores .",
    "many quantifiable properties about individual star - forming regions depend on the choice of boundary used to describe the region .",
    "for example , the star formation efficiency depends on the gas mass enclosed within a given region surrounding ysos .",
    "it is thus important to have objective criteria for defining the boundaries of subregions within clouds and determining the memberships of these groups . to apply this in a systematic fashion",
    "we utilize a nearest - neighbor algorithm similar to that discussed by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . across the cloud",

    "we also note that significant substructure exists within the regions defined in this manner ( see , e.g. , study of ngc  1333 by @xcite ) .",
    "a more exhaustive analysis of the clustering substructure in these clouds is outside the scope of this work .    as input for this analysis we use the list of yso candidates from the catalogs included in the final delivery of c2d data @xcite .",

    "a similar issue is seen when applying the algorithm to the samples of in serpens @xcite : there a much higher surface density encompasses the entire surveyed region .",
    "it thus appears that the ll03 criterion is too loose to capture the substructure of the regions .",
    "this becomes even more aggravated by the fact that our yso catalogs do not include the most evolved ysos , those with little mid - infrared excesses .",

    "for example , in b1 the loose group further south in the extinction ridge and the per  6 aggregate have about 25% class i sources .",
    "the ratio of class i ysos in the ophiuchus groups is more similar to that of ic  348 than those of the smaller groups and ngc  1333 .",
    "another property which is interesting to compare is the star formation efficiency , @xmath62 ( see  [ numbers_peroph ] ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite it is convenient to distinguish between the `` core '' star formation efficiency , @xmath58 , and `` cloud '' star formation efficiency , @xmath59 : @xmath58 is based on the masses of the embedded ysos in the cloud compared to the mass of the dust and gas already collected in dense cores .",
    "it is therefore a good measure of the star formation efficiency for the current generation of dense cores but does not take into account those stars which have evolved away from the embedded stages or those cores which may still form from gas within the cloud . @xmath59",
    "in contrast is based on the masses of all ( identified ) ysos in the studied region and the total mass based on extinction maps ( i.e. , mass in the extended cloud at lower column densities ) and therefore captures the star formation efficiency over the larger time - span corresponding to the evolution of the ysos from the formation of the cores through the yso class 0ii stages .",
    "the biggest caveats about these definitions are ( 1 ) the completeness of the yso samples ( large number of diskless ysos may for example remain undefined by the photometric surveys because they have too little dust emission to show significant infrared excesses ) and ( 2 ) that dust and gas in the cloud might disperse over the timescale during which the ysos evolve .",
    "for the regions in perseus and ophiuchus , values of @xmath58 are 1030% - with no significant differences between the two clouds . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the average number for perseus ( 2.6% ) is only slightly lower than in ophiuchus ( 4.1% ) .",
    "when individual regions are considered , however , a more pronounced difference is found : the two clusters and the ophiuchus region show @xmath59 values of about 6% whereas the more isolated groups show lower efficiencies of about 2% ( at the 1@xmath63 level ) . for the tight groups and clusters , the regions in ophiuchus - except l1689 - and ngc  1333 and ic  348 , also show higher efficiencies than do the smaller regions of perseus .",
    "these differences can be interpreted in two ways : one possibility is that there is a continuous replenishment of material in the dense cores and the higher @xmath59 of the larger regions simply reflect that these are more effective in turning dust and gas into new stars .",
    "a different explanation is that the smaller regions in perseus only recently have started forming stars and therefore show a lower @xmath64 than the larger clouds .",
    "we will return to this discussion in  [ discuss ] .",
    "the differences between perseus and ophiuchus in the numbers of embedded protostars are interesting in the context of the evolution of ysos through their earliest stages - and suggests evolutionary differences between the two clouds related to differences either in the evolution of individual ysos or the star formation complex as a whole . to reiterate , compared to perseus , the regions in ophiuchus show :    1",
    ".   a lower fraction of class i sources compared to the total number of ysos 2 .   a lower fraction of mips sources associated with scuba cores 3 .",
    "fewer `` red '' ( @xmath8-[4.5 ] > 1 $ ] and @xmath9-[24 ] > 4.5 $ ] ) sources from the comparison of the scuba cores and mips sources from this paper and @xcite    the differences between the number of sources in these different classes raise concerns about timescales for the evolution of prestellar cores and protostars derived on basis of for example the relative numbers of starless and starforming cores or the number of class i vs. ii sources . in terms of star formation efficiencies , the central ophiuchus region(s ) and the two clusters in perseus , ic  348 and ngc  1333 , show higher cloud star formation efficiencies than l1689 in ophiuchus and the smaller l1455 , l1448 and b1 groups in perseus .",
    "one explanation for the differences between the number of embedded sources in ophiuchus and perseus might be that the clouds have different `` ages '' .",
    "if star formation has initiated ( e.g. , been triggered ) at a given time in the recent past of the cloud history and the embedded ysos evolve on similar timescales the lower number of embedded sources in ophiuchus suggest that this cloud is more evolved compared to perseus .",
    "a similar effect has been observed within perseus with clear differences in the numbers of embedded ysos in ic  348 and ngc  1333 @xcite in line with the different age estimates for the two clusters of about 2  myr @xcite and @xmath19  1  myr @xcite , respectively .",
    "the difference in @xmath59 between ophiuchus and perseus could then simply reflect that a smaller amount of the dust and gas has turned into stars at this point of the evolution of perseus . in principle",
    ", there is no reason why star formation in perseus and ophiuchus should have initiated at the same time , so from that perspective this is definitely a plausible scenario .",
    "what does complicate the picture of a pure evolutionary effect are the relative numbers of scuba cores with and without associated mips sources ( or protostellar and starless cores , respectively ) .",
    "as pointed out above , the small groups in perseus show very high numbers of class i sources corresponding to 90100% of the ysos in the groups , but these regions do not have the same high fractions of associated mips sources .",
    "this is naturally explained if b1 , l1448 and l1455 have all only recently started forming stars and therefore not all of their cores have yet collapsed .",
    "the issue with this interpretation is that ophiuchus also shows a low fraction of cores with embedded protostars relative to the total number of cores . in a scenario where the time for the initiation star formation differs",
    ", the relatively high number of starless cores in ophiuchus would therefore mean that these remaining starless cores either are `` fizzles '' ( i.e. , did not `` manage '' to collapse ) - or that a second generation of star formation is about to occur in this cloud .",
    "@xcite argued that the differences seen between l1689 and l1688 - the latter having a more active star formation history - could be attributed to sequential star formation triggered by a small group of young high mass stars , @xmath5sco , in the sco - cen association .",
    "another possible explanation for the differences between the regions in perseus and ophiuchus is that the physics regulating the star formation between these regions differ , e.g. , the time - scale for evolution through the embedded stages is different in the dense clusters in perseus and in ophiuchus compared to the more isolated groups .",
    "if the collapse of an ensemble of cores occurs stochastically over a time - scale which is long compared to the collapse time for an individual core , the ratio of sources in different evolutionary stages can be used as a statistical tool for measuring the relative durations of star formation phases .",
    "thus , if the collapse of cores occurs slower ( or the rate is lower ) or if the timescale for evolution through the embedded stages is shorter - more class 0/i sources would have time to evolve away from the embedded stages skewing the statistics toward more evolved ( class ii ) ysos .",
    "such a solution could explain the undercounting of embedded sources in ophiuchus as a whole but does not explain the higher @xmath59 in ophiuchus and ngc  1333 and ic  348 .    what could be the physical explanations for such a difference ? as pointed out by @xcite pre - stellar cores and protostars formed in more dense star - forming regions are likely to have high masses on small scales , which in turn will imply high accretion rates , e.g. , compared to objects in less dense regions such as taurus .",
    "if this is the case , one would therefore expect that the ophiuchus protostars were found in regions with higher extinction ( and thus further evolved ) than those in perseus .",
    "if one compares the major clusters in the two clouds , there does seem to be such a trend with l1688 and l1689 having an average extinction of 1517 compared to the 813 for ic  348 and ngc  1333 .",
    "this would in turn require that the current population of embedded protostars in perseus have lower accretion rates than those few sources observed in ophiuchus .",
    "other factors , such as differences in the global and local magnetic field strengths between perseus and ophiuchus , could of course also be important in this context , although no strong observational constraints exist .",
    "a final explanation for the differences between ophiuchus and perseus could simply be that the empirical evolutionary classification scheme does not apply well to comparisons across clouds .",
    "for example , it is important to realize the difference between the mid - infrared and submillimeter observations : where the latter measures the dust ( plus gas ) mass , @xmath65 , and core temperature , the former measures the extinction or line of sight column density , @xmath66 , - and thus mid - infrared `` redness '' - of the central star+disk system . if one just takes a spherical symmetric envelope with a density profile , @xmath67 and inner and outer radii , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , it is easily seen that : @xmath70 when @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "that is , a larger inner radius decreases the extinction of a given protostellar source ( e.g. , making it visible at shorter wavelengths @xcite or reducing its `` redness '' ) while not affecting the envelope mass and vice versa : a larger outer radius only increases the envelope mass and thus submillimeter flux , but does not affect the mid - infrared signature of the source . if the inner radius or flattening of the protostellar envelopes in ophiuchus is larger than that in perseus the protostars there will appear more evolved if classified based on their mid - infrared colors or @xmath31 .",
    "this could for example be the case if the angular momenta of the pre - stellar cores had been different , resulting in larger centrifugal radii for the sources in ophiuchus .",
    "the difference in the maximum redness in perseus and ophiuchus (  [ midirsubmm ] ) could be taken as evidence that such an effect is in play .",
    "the bottom line is that based on the current data it is difficult to say which scenario is most likely ; indeed , a combination very likely applies .",
    "regardless , challenges are brought to the definition of the most deeply embedded stages of low - mass protostars , i.e. , class 0 stage .",
    "it is here useful to remind of the three definitions of class 0 sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the conceptional definition of the class 0 stage is that the protostar has accreted less than half its final mass , but since it is difficult to determine the masses of the central protostars , this definition is not useful for practical purposes .",
    "two main observational definitions are in play : most often that the object emit most of its luminosity at submillimeter wavelength ( either quantified by a ratio of the submillimeter luminosity to total luminosity , @xmath73% or a bolometric temperature lower than 70100  k ) - or that it has a high mass accretion rate or equivalently drives a powerful outflow .",
    "the main issue is that taken separately , the ophiuchus and perseus data provide very different arguments for the life - time of the class 0 stage . assuming a constant birthrate , the relatively large number of embedded ysos in perseus compared to more evolved ysos suggests that the class 0 stage is not simply a short - lived , high accretion stage .",
    "this is in direct contrast to the conclusion derived from the ophiuchus yso sample , where the deeply embedded sources are significantly outnumbered , requiring a very short - lived class 0 phase .",
    "a reasonable solution to this discrepancy may be that differences between the appearance of the ysos reflects strongly their environments ( physical conditions ) . in this case ,",
    "class 0 protostars may not represent a clearly defined early stage in the evolution of protostars but rather , an environmentally affected , continuum into class i protostars ( as also discussed by @xcite ) . an alternative explanation , that star formation occurs in bursts , could explain the differences if the most recent burst in perseus has occurred more recently than that in ophiuchus .",
    "in this case , however , the relative number of embedded versus more evolved ysos does not reveal their relative time - scales and thus do not provide the evidence that the time - scale for the evolution through the most deeply embedded class  0 stage is significantly shorter than the evolution through the class  i stage .",
    "we have combined scuba submillimeter dust continuum and spitzer mid - ir surveys of the current star formation in the ophiuchus cloud complex .",
    "the results are compared to our previous study of perseus .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows :    * we have applied a method developed for identifying embedded protostars in perseus @xcite directly to the ophiuchus datasets .",
    "* little dispersal of the protostars with respect to the scuba cores are seen similar to the situation in perseus .",
    "fewer red sources are found in ophiuchus compared to perseus - but also a higher fraction of starless scuba cores . *",
    "although distance does not directly play into the definition of scuba cores , the ophiuchus surveys are more sensitive to dust emission from disks , representing a small , but non - negligible fraction of the sources seen in the scuba survey .",
    "* as was the case in perseus most of the scuba cores in ophiuchus with high concentrations also have associated mips sources , likely reflecting the heating of the dust from the central source making them appear more peaked .",
    "four high concentration scuba cores without associated ysos are identified and are found to be the likely result of the impact of outflow and the structure of the ambient environment . * using a nearest - neighbor algorithm we calculate surface and volume densities of the ysos in perseus and ophiuchus and from those identify groups and clusters in each of the clouds . for each of these regions",
    "we calculate key numbers such as masses , star formation efficiencies and the fraction of embedded objects . *",
    "the star formation efficiency varies across and within clouds .",
    "perseus has a high efficiency in turning material from the scuba cores into embedded protostars ( a high @xmath58 ) , driven primarily by the efficiency in its smaller groups ( b1 , l1455 and l1448 ) .",
    "the large clusters in perseus ( ngc  1333 and ic  348 ) have lower core sfes , similar to those found across ophiuchus .",
    "the cloud sfe measured on basis of the larger scale dust extinction and the overall population of ysos , however , is somewhat higher in ophiuchus than in perseus primarily because these same small groups in perseus ( b1 , l1455 and l1448 ) have a larger fraction of their mass still not turned into cores or stars . generally , though the cloud sfe is lower than the core sfe , suggesting that the star formation mechanism is more inefficient on larger relative to smaller scales .",
    "the fraction of class i sources relative to ysos also vary from about 10% in ophiuchus and ic  348 to 35% in ngc  1333 and more than 90% in the inner regions of b1 , l1455 and l1448 . finally , the fraction of starless cores in ophiuchus is found to be high compared to in perseus .",
    "* we discuss possible explanations for the differences between the regions in perseus and ophiuchus , such as ( i ) that the ysos have evolved over different timescales , ( ii ) that the physics regulating the star formation , e.g. , the accretion in the two clouds , differ , or ( iii ) that the empirical evolutionary classification scheme does not apply well when comparing samples of ysos from different clouds . based on the existing samples it is not possible to rule out any of these scenarios , and",
    "likely all three may be relevant for the full picture of the star formation properties of the two clouds . in any case",
    ", the results do raise questions about the standard picture of the class 0 stage being a short - lived precursor to the class i stage in the evolution of embedded ysos .",
    "the results presented here provide a direct comparison of the global star formation properties of the larger scale clouds and also provides important constraints on - and raises questions about - the general low - mass star formation scenario .",
    "it demonstrates the importance of the systematic approach using the large scale maps which are currently appearing from spitzer and the new submillimeter cameras , laboca on apex and scuba-2 on the jcmt .",
    "together these surveys can address whether differences between the number of sources in the embedded stages are generally seen or , e.g. , whether perseus or ophiuchus contain yso populations `` more representative '' for other regions currently forming stars .",
    "other complementary observations ( e.g. , large scale submillimeter line maps ) can address whether differences in the initial conditions ( e.g. , pressure or turbulence ) could be responsible for the observed differences in the yso populations .",
    "at the same time these large - scale surveys are providing important unbiased samples of embedded low - mass protostars that will be obvious targets for detailed observations with upcoming facilities such as alma .",

    "<S> we present a census of the population of deeply embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) in the ophiuchus molecular cloud complex based on a combination of spitzer space telescope mid - infrared data from the `` cores to disks '' ( c2d ) legacy team and jcmt / scuba submillimeter maps from the complete team . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied a method developed for identifying embedded protostars in perseus to these datasets and in this way construct a relatively unbiased sample of 27 candidate embedded protostars with envelopes more massive than our sensitivity limit ( about 0.1 @xmath0 ) . as in perseus , the mid - infrared sources are located close to the center of the scuba cores and the narrowness of the spatial distribution of mid - infrared sources around the peaks of the scuba cores suggests that no significant dispersion of the newly formed ysos has occurred . </S>",
    "<S> embedded ysos are found in 35% of the scuba cores - less than in perseus ( 58% ) . on the other hand the mid - infrared sources in ophiuchus have less red mid - infrared colors , possibly indicating that they are less embedded . </S>",
    "<S> we apply a nearest neighbour surface density algorithm to define the substructure in each of the clouds and calculate characteristic numbers for each subregion - including masses , star formation efficiencies , fraction of embedded sources etc . </S>",
    "<S> generally the main clusters in ophiuchus and perseus ( l1688 , ngc1333 and ic  348 ) are found to have higher star formation efficiencies than small groups such as b1 , l1455 and l1448 , which on the other hand are completely dominated by deeply embedded protostars . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible explanations for the differences between the regions in perseus and ophiuchus , such as different evolutionary timescales for the ysos or differences , e.g. , in the accretion in the two clouds . </S>"
