    "more than a decade ago , high power impulse magnetron sputtering ( hipims ) was introduced as a variation of conventional dc magnetron sputtering ( dcms ) @xcite .",
    "hipims is typically characterised by high discharge peak currents and a high degree of ionisation of the sputtered species enabling energetic growth conditions with enhanced control possibilities during film deposition .",

    "optical imaging using high speed cameras revealed the presence of plasma instabilities along the racetrack of the target , so - called plasma bunches , ionisation zones , spokes or emission structures @xcite .",
    "these zones of intense plasma follow the @xmath3 drift ( other drifts in the same direction are included ) of the electrons with a velocity of about 1/10 of the electrons drift velocity and their motion seems to be a consequence of the `` evacuation '' of ions from their location of production ( ionisation ) @xcite .",
    "the number and the shape of the zones depend on the discharge current @xcite .",
    "typically , the zones reveal an arrow - like shape with the tip pointing in the direction of the motion , but at higher currents it changes to a rather globular appearance which appears to be associated to a change of the ionization zones plasma and potential distribution in the direction perpendicular to the target , as fast imaging techniques suggest @xcite .    a phenomenological model of the ionisation zones",
    "was introduced by gallian _",
    "_  to qualitatively described the observed effect @xcite . in order to explain the different shapes , triangular ( arrow - like ) or diffuse ( globular ) , hecimovic _ et al",
    "_  presented a model that is based on the localised generation of secondary electrons @xcite .",
    "the configuration of the electric field along the target s racetrack was first discussed by brenning _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and later modified by anders _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . in the latter publication",
    "it is argued that for a closed racetrack , the potential needs to be reproduced when returning to the same location .",
    "this implies the presence of a double layer enclosing the ionisation zone with negative space charges at the outside and positive space charges in the centre .",
    "the resulting potential hump has a maximum , most likely at the place of maximum plasma intensity , and appears to be asymmetric according to the recorded optical images of the ionisation zones . as a consequence of such an electric field configuration , the local @xmath3 drift causes an acceleration of electrons away from the target surface @xcite which was noticed as the appearance of plasma flares .",
    "such plasma flares extending away from the target surface into the space of the vacuum chamber were recorded by ni _",
    "et al . _  and it was shown that they are associated to moving ionisation zones @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic imaging with short exposure times revealed that the light emission from excited target atoms and ions ( an al target was used for this study ) stems from a region in the vicinity of the target surface , whereas the light emission from excited ar background gas atoms and ions was more distributed including areas distant from the target @xcite .",
    "even though the highest concentration of ions from the target material appears close to the target surface within the ionisation zones , the angular dependence of their flux from the racetrack has been recognised to influence the film growth conditions when using hipims discharges to synthesise thin film materials .    when depositing ti and cr films on substrates placed on the side of the magnetron and perpendicular to the target surface normal ( corresponding to an angle of 90  in the current work , but shifted away from target surface ) , lundin _ et al .",
    "achieved normalised deposition rates of 0.8 and 0.5 for ti and cr , respectively @xcite .",
    "the reference position for the normalisation was opposite to the target surface ( 0  in this work ) . compared to dcms ,",
    "the hipims deposition rates on the side of the magnetron was higher by 10% in the case of ti and by 25% in the case of cr . by recording the ion energy distribution functions ( iedfs ) at places similar to the substrate positions",

    "et al . _",
    "applying a retarded field analyser to measure the ion energies spatially and angularly resolved in planes parallel to the target surface @xcite .",
    "the obtained mean ion energies from a ti target had maxima in the direction of the @xmath3 drift and , hence , the potential hump motion direction ( @xmath0 in this work ) .    in a previous work",
    ", we studied the time- and energy - resolved characteristics of hipims and dcms discharges from a nb target in planes parallel to the target surface @xcite .",
    "integration of the iedfs revealed that a higher number of nb@xmath4 and even more so of nb@xmath5 ions are emitted in the direction of the electrons @xmath3 drift .",
    "this directionality is a result of the ionisation zone and associated potential hump motion as the doubly charged nb ions gained roughly double the energy , i.e.  the energy contribution in the iedfs originating from the acceleration in the potential hump .",
    "these results were observed in highly ionised hipims discharges , but to some extend also in conventional dcms discharges @xcite although other driving factors play a role which even lead to a reversal of the motion direction of ionization zones @xcite . however , since ions from the target material significantly contribute to the film growth in hipims , we decided to study the angular resolved thin film growth conditions in hipims with the aim of relating them to the newly discovered plasma characteristics , i.e.  the moving ionisation zones and associated potential humps .",

    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : nb - ions_iedfs_tangential ] , nb@xmath9 and nb@xmath5 ions were detected in the studied hipims plasma with maxima in energy of 200 and 300 ev , respectively .",
    "these maxima were recorded at an emission angle of 0 , where the formation of an extended high energy tail in the iedfs around this angle is more pronounced for nb@xmath5 as compared to the iedfs of nb@xmath9 . in the medium energy range at about 50 ev in the case of nb@xmath9 and at about 100 ev in the case of nb@xmath5 , there were higher count rates in the iedfs in the angular range between 0 and 90  than in the respective iedfs in the range from 0 to 90 , even though the experimental setup was geometrically symmetric .        the nb ion count rate as shown in fig .",

    "o@xmath4 is the most abundant ion species ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : o(+)-ions_iedfs_tangential ] ) .",
    "the atomic oxygen iedfs revealed high - energy tails extending up to 200 ev , whereas the o@xmath23 ions are mainly thermalised with an energy of a few ev .",
    "however , the angular flux of all these ions is rather isotropic as the differences in the ion count rates between positive and negative angles are smaller than in the case of the other positively charged ions .",
    "in addition to the single - element ions described so far , also molecular nbo ions were detected as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbo - ions_iedfs_tangential ] . the iedfs of nbo@xmath4 and nbo@xmath5 extend to maximum energies of about 100 ev while both ion species preferentially flow sidewards .",
    "similar to the nb ions , more ions are recorded at positive angles and the fraction of doubly charged nbo ions is higher at high angles with respect to the target surface normal .",
    "the integrated count rates of the nbo ions , however , are about two orders of magnitude lower than the integrated count rates of the nb ions .          due to the high electronegativity of oxygen , it is typical to encounter negatively charged oxygen ions in gas discharges with a fraction of o@xmath7 in the atmosphere . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : o(-)-ions_iedfs_tangential ] , o@xmath24 and o@xmath25 ions were observed within the current work .",
    "their iedfs show three distinct energy regions : thermalised and low - energy ions with energies below 100 ev , a medium energy peak at about 300 ev ( only in the case of o@xmath24 ) and a high energy peak at about 600 ev .",
    "the latter two features are only present at angles between 20 and 20 , i.e.  at emission angles close to the target surface normal .",

    "the elevated constant background signal recorded for all studied emission angles is most likely due to electrons reaching the detector and not related to negatively charged ions . however , comparing both negatively charged oxygen ions , it is apparent that o@xmath24 ions represent the majority as shown by the angular ion fractions in fig .",

    ", however , the oxygen content in the films increases regardless of the position on the substrate holder . at an angle of 40 ,",
    "all deposited nbo@xmath2 films were perfectly stoichiometric with respect to nb@xmath7o@xmath26 , whereas at 80  the films were overstoichiometric in oxygen . in the latter case ,",
    "a large scattering of the o / nb ratio was present , without apparent correlation to the deposition position .",
    "all films revealed an amorphous structure , most likely due to the growth conditions without external heating and bias voltage .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : film_properties](b ) , the films deposited in radial direction of the racetrack show the expected reduction in film thickness with increasing deposition angle .",
    "regarding the influence of the ionisation zone motion , it is apparent that a higher film thickness was obtained if the substrate was placed in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 direction .",
    "even at an angle of 40  the deposition rate in @xmath0 direction was equal or even slightly increased as compared to 0 .",
    "at 80 , the deposition rate in this direction was still about 50% .",
    "the generally lower values of the film thickness calculated from the rbs data is most likely due to the lower thin film density than the assumed nb@xmath20o@xmath21 bulk density .",
    "apparently , the evolution of the film thickness is influenced by a variation of the density .",

    "the density is slightly reduced but remains rather constant , whereas in @xmath1 direction a strong reduction in density with increasing angle can be noticed .",
    "since nbo@xmath2 or nb@xmath7o@xmath26 films are frequently used as optical thin films due to their high transmittance , high refractive index and chemical stability @xcite , we performed a brief characterisation of their optical properties .",

    "an asymmetry in the plasma properties of hipims discharges , in particular in the ion energy , has been reported by several researchers @xcite .",
    "the observed differences in the iedfs between the @xmath3 directions were explained by the motion of the ionisation zones and the associated potential humps @xcite .",
    "details about the formation of potential humps can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite ; here we will limit the discussion to the influence of the potential hump on the ion energy .",
    "ionisation zones represent perturbations of the plasma cloud in the vicinity of the target surface and are characterised by high plasma density and increased light emission as compared to other regions .",
    "they are enveloped by a double layer with ions concentrated in the centre and electrons at the outer margins , where the latter can leave the zone due to their higher mobility .",
    "the resulting electric field causes an additional @xmath3 drift and the path of the drifting electrons is most likely diverted as described in @xcite .",
    "however , ions , which are not magnetised in typically used magnetron sputter deposition systems , can experience an acceleration in the local electric field if they originate from the centre region of the ionisation zone . passing through the associated potential hump ,",
    "the direction of ions motion is altered , usually off - axis with respect to the target surface normal .",
    "this effect can explain the observed broader angular ion flux in hipims discharges as compared to the typical ion flux in dcms @xcite .",
    "in addition , the motion of the ionisation zones and the associated potential hump causes another acceleration of the ions .",
    "ions leaving the potential hump region in the same direction as its motion can `` surf '' on the front of this plasma wave and gain an additional energy of a few 10 ev @xcite .",
    "this effect can be noticed in the iedfs of the positively charged ions , in particular in the iedfs of nb@xmath4 and nb@xmath5 where there is an additional contribution for the ions recorded at positive angles , i.e.  in @xmath0 direction , as compared to the ones measured at negative angles ( @xmath1 direction ) . even though this energy peak is rather broad , the fact , that the nb@xmath5 ions gain approximately twice the energy that the nb@xmath4 ions win , points towards an acceleration mechanism in an electric field which is in agreement with the above discussed presence of potential humps in the ionisation zones .",
    "besides this angular asymmetry in the iedfs , the obtained absolute values of the ion energies with maxima of up to 100 and 200 ev for the singly and doubly charged ions , respectively , are high and enable energetic growth conditions for dense thin films . due to the high degree of ionisation in hipims , ions make up a major fraction of the film forming species which is in contrast to conventional magnetron sputter deposition processes where mainly neutral atoms condense on the substrate .",
    "in addition to the kinetic energy of the ions , they also provide potential energy upon the capture of electrons when they are incorporated into the growing film @xcite .",
    "this energy contribution is identical to the ionisation energy and , hence , the presence of a significant amount of doubly charged ions , as it is the case in the present work , enhances this effect .",
    "another important aspect for the growth of thin films is the angular distribution of the ion flux . with the exception of the positively charged oxygen ions",
    ", all ion species showed an anisotropic distribution where the flux along the target surface normal was typically lower as compared to the flux sidewards .",
    "in addition , there is a difference in the flux with respect to the @xmath3 direction .",
    "higher ion fluxes were recorded in the @xmath0 direction as compared to the @xmath1 direction for the nb , ar and nbo ions .",
    "however , a major impact on the energetic growth conditions should result from the fact that the doubly charged nb , ar and nbo ions are preferably emitted sidewards , hence providing more energy for the film growth at these angles .    comparing the integrated count rates of all positively charged ion species ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : nb - ions_iedfs_tangential](c)[fig : nbo - ions_iedfs_tangential](c ) ) , the most abundant ion species is o@xmath4 followed by both nb and then both ar ions .",
    "et al . _  also reported the highest intensity of o@xmath4 for a ti target operated in `` poisoned '' mode @xcite .",
    "the plasma from an al target operated with similar discharge parameters , however , showed the highest intensities for al@xmath4 during and for ar@xmath4 after the hipims pulse . beside this material dependence of the plasma composition in hipims also the geometry of the device ,",
    "in particular the direction of the gas inlet , is of importance . for the deposition of stoichiometric zro@xmath7 thin films , vlek _ et al .",
    "_  observed significant contents of o@xmath4 and o@xmath23 ions when the o@xmath7 gas inlet pointed towards the target @xcite . injecting the o@xmath7 gas in direction towards the substrate resulted in a very ar@xmath4-rich plasma .",
    "in addition to the positively charged ions , the appearance of negatively charged ions in the sputter plasmas containing o@xmath7 has been reported by several researchers @xcite .",
    "the interest in studying these ions was triggered by the fact that a fraction of the negatively charged ions revealed an energy of several 100 ev . in the current work , two ion species , o@xmath24 and o@xmath25 , with peaks in their iedfs at about 600 ev were noticed .",
    "these ions are formed on or near the target surface and then accelerated in the cathode fall , i.e.  their energy gain corresponds to the discharge voltage ( @xmath8600 v in this work ) .",
    "small additional energy gains most likely result from sputtering effects @xcite .",
    "other peaks in the iedfs of negatively charged oxygen containing ions were identified to stem from dissociated molecular ions @xcite .",
    "this explains the appearance of the peak at @xmath8300 ev in the iedfs of o@xmath24 which result from o@xmath25 ions that were dissociated , most likely in a collision with an electron , into a neutral o atom and an o@xmath24 ion equally sharing the initial energy of the molecular ion .",
    "other contributions from dissociated nbo@xmath27 ions , similar to metal - oxygen ions reported in @xcite , were not recorded and such ions are absent in the studied discharge within the sensitivity of the measurement .",
    "most of the work regarding negative oxygen ions was performed using dcms discharges rather than hipims and the acceleration mechanism appears to remain unchanged when applying energetic pulses instead of dc power @xcite .",
    "however , with the discovery of the ionisation zones , the question arises whether the associated potential hump influences the trajectory of the negatively charged oxygen ions or not .",
    "angular and lateral scans of the ion flux in dcms revealed that these ions mainly travel parallel to the target surface normal which can be understood by the direction of the electric field in the sheath that is perpendicular to the target surface @xcite .",
    "changes of the target surface topography due to the progressing erosion result in slightly diverting ion trajectories @xcite . as schematically shown in @xcite , the electric field is strongly distorted in the vicinity of an ionisation zone possibly altering the emission angle of negatively charged ions . however , according to the angular distribution of the o@xmath24 and o@xmath25 ion fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : o(-)-ions_iedfs_tangential](c ) , the high - energy ions are all within @xmath1320  of the target surface normal .",
    "in addition , there is no difference between the two @xmath3 directions indicating that the disturbance of the electric field in the potential hump has little effect on the fast negatively charged oxygen ions because the height of the potential hump is much smaller compared to the potential drop in the target sheath .",
    "nevertheless , these very energetic ions can significantly influence the thin film growth conditions when they impact on the substrate , which will be discussed in the following .",
    "the beneficial effects of ion bombardment for the growth of thin films using physical vapour deposition in general @xcite and hipims in particular @xcite have been described in great detail . for the current work",

    ", oxygen atoms have a higher sticking coefficient than molecular o@xmath7 and , therefore , their presence enables the growth of stoichiometric oxides @xcite . for the current study",
    ", this suggests that the dissociation of o@xmath7 in the hipims discharge is more effective at high angles as higher oxygen contents were measured in the films deposited at these positions .",
    "however , with the high degree of ionisation in hipims , the condensation of ions onto the substrate makes up a major fraction of film growth .",
    "the flux of positively charged oxygen ions is rather isotropic and , therefore , most likely without influence on differences in the stoichiometry of the films . as mentioned above , the deposited films were overstoichiometric in nb at a deposition angle of 0 , even though the flux of niobium ions was reduced in this direction as compared to the flux at higher angles .",
    "a possible explanation would be that the chemical composition is strongly influenced by neutrals which were not analysed in detail within this work .",
    "an alternative explanation would be resputtering effects due to the bombardment with energetic negatively charged oxygen ions . in this case ,",
    "preferential sputtering of o atoms from the growing film upon impact of o@xmath24 ( and o@xmath25 ) should occur due to the matching mass and , hence , optimal momentum transfer .",
    "since the flux of these ions is limited to a narrow range near the target surface normal , the reduced oxygen content in the film deposited at 0  could be caused by such an effect .",
    "however , more detailed studies relating the angular ion fluxes to the stoichiometry of the synthesised thin films are needed to unambiguously identify the underlying effects",
    ".    another important beneficial effect of the increased ion bombardment when employing hipims for the growth of thin films is the higher density that can be achieved . as pointed out by samuelsson _",
    "_ , thin films deposited by hipims typically show an increased density by 515% as compared to films deposited by dcms @xcite . the higher degree of ionisation in hipims discharges , in particular of the sputtered species , results in an increased and more effective ion bombardment of the growing film and , hence , in a higher film density and improved properties like , e.g. , surface roughness @xcite . in the current work ,",
    "the film density remains constant when the deposition angle is increased in radial direction , but the film thickness decreases ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : film_properties ] ) .",
    "such an evolution in film thickness is in agreement with reports in literature @xcite .",
    "the situation is different when changing the deposition angle in tangential direction of the racetrack analogue to the measurements of the iedfs ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tangential_scan_direction ] and [ fig : depositions ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : film_properties ] , in @xmath1 direction , film density and thickness , decrease with increasing deposition angle indicating disadvantageous film growth conditions .",
    "in contrast , film density and thickness remain constant or are only slightly reduced when the deposition angle is increased in @xmath0 direction .",
    "the higher flux of ions in @xmath0 as compared to @xmath1 direction provides more film forming species and , hence , a higher deposition rate can be achieved .",
    "further , as ions make up a large or major fraction of the film forming species , the beneficial effects of increased ion bombardment come to the fore even though no additional substrate bias was applied during deposition .    finally , the formation of an amorphous phase for all synthesised nbo@xmath2 thin films is in agreement with literature .",
    "_ reported the formation of amorphous nbo@xmath2 films in deposition by dcms without external heating and grounded substrates @xcite .",
    "apparently , the additional energy input from the high degree of ionisation in the hipims discharge applied within this work to grow the nbo@xmath2 films is still insufficient to trigger the growth of a crystalline nbo@xmath2 phase .",
    "similar results were reported by hla _",
    "et al . _ who also obtained amorphous nbo@xmath2 films regardless of the applied deposition technique : dcms , hipims or modulated pulse power magnetron sputtering @xcite .",
    "all films were optically transparent which is also in agreement with the films from the current study .",
    "the angular asymmetry in the ion energy distributions and ion fluxes in hipims discharges with respect to the racetrack is also present in reactive oxygen - containing atmospheres .",
    "the ion flux is higher in @xmath0 than in @xmath1 direction , i.e.  more ions are emitted in the same direction as the ionisation zone and associated potential hump motion .",
    "in addition , there is a pronounced asymmetry in the ion fraction with varying emission angle as doubly charged nb , ar and nbo ions are preferably emitted sidewards with respect to the target surface normal .",
    "these ions also show contributions in their iedfs in the medium energy range that have about twice the energy as the respective contributions in the iedfs of the singly charged ions indicating an acceleration by an electric field . as expected , negatively charged oxygen ions were detected as well .",
    "their high - energy fraction with a peak at about 600 ev is practically not influenced by the potential hump as they were only recorded along the direction of the target surface normal and since the potential hump is relatively small .",
    "the observed plasma properties were correlated with thin film growth conditions .",
    "the deposited nbo@xmath2 films showed a change in stoichiometry with variation of the deposition angle .",
    "further , higher deposition rates were noticed in @xmath0 direction which could be correlated with the higher ion fluxes in this direction .",
    "however , no significant changes of the measured optical properties were observed regardless of the deposition angle and position .",
