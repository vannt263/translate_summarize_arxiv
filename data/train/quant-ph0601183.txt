    "the realization of a universal quantum circuit is a great challenge in quantum information science .",
    "it is known that an arbitrary quantum computation can be performed by combining quantum gates , i.e. unitary operators acting on qubits , that form a _",
    "universal set_. we distinguish two types of universal sets .",
    "the first one is composed of a general one - qubit gate [ corresponding to a general operator @xmath0 of @xmath1 and a two - qubit entangling gate  @xcite ; the second type is composed by a single kind of gates , called _ universal gates _",
    ", like the controlled - unitary gate ( cu )  @xcite .    in order to make quantum computations , the implementations of these quantum gates have to be robust",
    ", i.e. they have to be insensitive to fluctuations or to partial knowledge of experimental parameters .",
    "furthermore they have to be insensitive to decoherence effects , such as spontaneous emission .",
    "those conditions can be fulfilled if the qubit is encoded in atomic metastable states , and if the gates are implemented by adiabatic passage along dark states , i.e. instantaneous eigenstates with time independent eigenvalue ( equal to the energy of the ground states ) and with zero projection on the excited states .    however , adiabaticity is not sufficient to insure the robustness of certain quantum gates .",
    "the parameters that determine the action of the gates on qubits , like the argument of the rotation gate or the phase of the controlled - phase gate , have to be controlled with high accuracy to perform computation  @xcite .",
    "we therefore have to avoid the use of the non - robust dynamical phases , depending on the area under the adiabatic pulses , and of geometric phases  @xcite that require the control of a loop in the parameter space .",
    "an alternative technique consists in using elliptic polarisation and static phase difference of lasers , which can be easily controlled experimentally .",
    "following this idea , the implementation of a general single qubit gate based on fractional stimulated raman adiabatic passage ( f - stirap )  @xcite in a tripod - type system  @xcite has been proposed in ref .",
    "a multi - controlled - unitary gate acting on qubits fixed in an optical cavity has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but with an undesirable phase gate that has to be compensated .",
    "the latter proposition is based on the two - qubit adiabatic transfert described in ref .",
    "@xcite and f - stirap .",
    "since in experimental implementations of quantum computations the errors grow with the number of quantum gates involved , it is advantageous to implement directly certain gates instead of relegating them to a combinaison of elementary gates , as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the direct implementation of the swap gate .",
    "there is a double advantage : to reduce the errors with a smaller number of gates and to decrease decoherence effects by reducing the computational time .    in this paper",
    "we propose a direct implementation by adiabatic passage along dark states of a _ arbitrary state controlled - unitary gate _ using only seven pulses .",
    "this gate can be writen as @xmath2\\ ] ] in the basis @xmath3 , where @xmath0 ( respectively @xmath4 ) are an unitary ( the identity ) operator of @xmath5 , @xmath6 an arbitrary control state of the first qubit , @xmath7 its orthogonal state .",
    "this process is based on dark states generalising those of f - stirap and of ref .",
    "@xcite , and particularly adapted for a two - qubit controlled - rotation operation .",
    "this gate has potential applications for the rapid realisation of quantum algorithms .",
    "we show for instance that it allows a direct implementation of the projective measurement algorithm .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the system is introduced in section  [ system ] . the definition and the dynamics of the gate",
    "are shown in section  [ dynamics ] .",
    "section  [ numeric ] is devoted to the numerical demonstration , and section  [ end ] presents some conclusions .",
    "for @xmath8 . for the generation of single qubit gates , each transition is driven by laser ; for the two - qubit states rotation a cavity field drives the transition @xmath9 , the others are driven by lasers . ]    as in refs .",
    "@xcite we consider a register of qubits fixed in an optical cavity .",
    "each qubit is encoded in a tripod - type zeeman system composed of three metastable states and one excited state , and can be addressed individually by laser fields .",
    "the qubits interact with each other through the cavity mode  @xcite .",
    "the single qubit gates can be implemented in this system by coupling the three ground states by lasers  @xcite .",
    "we choose here to identify the zeeman sublevels @xmath10 to the computational states @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the ancillary state @xmath13 and the excited state @xmath14 are respectively denoted @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ zeeman ] ) .    during the dynamics ,",
    "the excited state @xmath16 is coupled to the computational states @xmath11 and @xmath12 by circularly polarised laser fields of rabi frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the superscript @xmath19 labels the atoms ) , and to the ancillary state @xmath15 by the linearly polarised cavity mode of rabi frequency @xmath20 which is time independent .",
    "each field is one - photon resonant , and their polarisation and frequencies are such that they drive a unique transition .",
    "the choice of the polarizations is guided by geometrical constraints , when we impose that the lasers propagate orthogonally to the cavity axis .",
    "the essential point is that the polarisation of the cavity mode is orthogonal to the plane of the circular polarisation of the lasers .",
    "in this section we describe the sequence of pulses that will permit to generate a _ arbitrary state controlled - unitary _ gate ( c@xmath21-u ) .",
    "we recall that a standard controlled - unitary gate yields a unitary operation on the target qubit if the control qubit is in state @xmath12 .",
    "we define its generalisation as follows . the arbitrary state controlled - unitary gate yields a unitary operation on the target qubit if the control qubit is in an arbitrary preselected state that we can choose robustly by the laser pulse parameters .",
    "it is equivalent to the quantum circuit represented on fig .",
    "[ circ1 ] , where @xmath22 are unitary operators and @xmath23 the control and target qubit .",
    "we use the following notation : the states of the system are written @xmath24 , where the indices @xmath25 denote respectively the states of the first and second qubit , and @xmath26 the photon number state of the cavity - mode .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a robust tool has been established to drive a complete population transfer between two - qubit states @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , if the states @xmath15 of each atom are coupled by the cavity , then a counter - intuitive pulse sequence @xmath28 induces the population transfer @xmath29 .",
    "such a coherent manipulation of the two - atom state @xmath30 offers various possibilities for the implementation of two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "this tool is at the heart of the swap gate in ref .",
    "@xcite and of the cnot gate in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as stirap  @xcite can be extended to f - stirap  @xcite , one can extend this process to the creation of coherent superpositions of the two - atom states . in this case , we use three laser fields of the form @xmath31 [ @xmath32 , @xmath33 , coupling respectively the states @xmath34 and @xmath35 of the first atom , the states @xmath36 and @xmath37 of the second atom . in the interaction picture and under the rotating wave approximation",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 the anihilation operator of the cavity mode , @xmath40 the rabi frequencies associated to the laser amplitudes @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction of the second qubit is parametrised by the following laser rabi frequencies :    ^(2)_0(t)&=&^(2)(t ) , + ^(2)_1(t)&=&^(2)(t ) ,    which can be generated in a robust way using a single laser of appropriate elliptic polarisation .",
    "we refer to such a laser as @xmath42 in what follows .",
    "we define for the second qubit one non - coupled and three coupled states as             where @xmath43 .",
    "the hamiltonian admits the following dark states , i.e. instantaneous eigenstates of null eigenvalues and not connected to excited atomic states , which belong to three orthogonal subspaces :         for the first one ,     [ psi4 ] |_4&=&|a_c|0+e^i(_1^(1)-_0^(2))|1a|0 + & -&e^-i_0^(2)|aa|1 ,    for the second one , and        & /&(1+^2+^2 ^ 2 ) ,    for the third one .",
    "the mixing angles are determined by the rabi frequencies through the relations    & = & ^(2)/g^(2 ) + & = & _ 1^(1)/g^(1 ) ,  = /.",
    "the dark states @xmath44 drive respectively the population of the states @xmath45 ; @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the adiabatic limit .    since the coupling between the dark states of a same subspace are respectively of the form    _ 2||_1 & = & - , + _ 4||_3 & = & - , + _ 6||_5 & = & ,    the six dark states can evolve freely and independently in the adiabatic limit under the condition @xmath48 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied when the amplitudes of the lasers interacting with the second atom vary with a constant ratio .",
    "it guarantees that there is no geometric phase , which would be detrimental for robustness .",
    "the dark states @xmath49 are stationnary states and do not participate in the dynamics . furthermore , since @xmath20 is time independent",
    ", we remark that for an arbitrary pulse sequence involving @xmath42 and @xmath50 , the initial population of the states @xmath51 stays always unchanged at the end of such a process .",

    "]    there are similarities between this linkage pattern and the one of the tripod - type system used for single qubit rotations  @xcite .",
    "it shows that the states @xmath53 can respectively evolve in the same way as the states @xmath54 involved in the single qubit rotation , leading to a robust rotation of the two - atom states @xmath55 .",
    "we first describe precisely the dynamics of this two - atom states rotation , before applying it to the construction of the arbitrary state controlled - unitary gate .",
    "we start with the initial state @xmath56 where @xmath57 are complex numbers such that @xmath58 .",
    "[ [ step1 ] ]  step  1 : + + + + + + + + +    we induce the initial connection to the dark states @xmath59 using the partially overlapping pulse sequence @xmath60 such that @xmath61  decreases from @xmath62 to 0 . in the adiabatic limit",
    "the dark states evolve independently , such that at the end of the pulse sequence the statevector becomes @xmath63 since @xmath64 is a stationary state .",

    "this induces the connection @xmath69 , and therefore the statevector becomes @xmath70 and at the end of the pulse sequence @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a general rotation of @xmath5 of angle @xmath67 around the vector @xmath73 .",
    "the components of this vector @xmath73 are @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the pauli operators defined for the second qubit : @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "we notice that the initial population of the states @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) , which are connected to the dark states @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) , stay unchanged at the end of the process .",
    "the first qubit controls the rotation applied on the second qubit .",
    "indeed , equations ( [ rotation ] ) and ( [ rotation2 ] ) show that the process described induces , up to a global phase @xmath87 , a rotation of the second qubit of angle @xmath67 around the vector @xmath73 on the bloch sphere only if the first one is in the ancillary state @xmath15",
    ". then , by transferring the population of an arbitrary preselected state of the first qubit on state @xmath15 before realising the two - atom rotation , we get a controlled - unitary gate generalised to the case of an arbitrary state for the control qubit . moreover ,",
    "if the couplings between the cavity mode and the atoms are much stronger than the classical laser field interaction , then the cavity is negligibly populated and the coupling between the atoms are given by a virtual photon .",
    "the proposed process is then decoherence - free in the sense that spontaneous radiation from the excited state and cavity damping are avoided .",
    "the extension of the previous process to the implementation of the arbitrary state controlled - unitary gate is now simple : it consists to transfer as a preliminary step the controlled state @xmath88 of the first qubit to its ancillary state @xmath15 .",
