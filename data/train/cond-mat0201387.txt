    "following the marginal fermi liquid theory @xcite , the nested fermi liquid theory @xcite or the ordinary memory - function approach @xcite , the low - frequency excitations of the electronic system involved in the optical conductivity and electronic raman scattering spectra of the overdoped high-@xmath1 cuprates are described in terms of the frequency - dependent effective mass @xmath5 and the frequency - dependent relaxation time @xmath6 , with a minor role played by selection rules or by normal - state coherence factors .",
    "attempts to explain the measurements in the underdoped cuprates using similar single - component models have been unsuccessful .",
    "anomalous low - frequency structures related to the superconducting ( sc ) pseudogap , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) pseudogap , the two - magnon excitations or the density waves are observed in the latter crystals , usually in one or two ( of four ) `` optical '' channels ( optical conductivity and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 raman symmetries ) .",
    "@xcite any theory of the low - frequency excitations in the underdoped cuprates should explain anomalies in both optical conductivity and raman scattering spectra , taking the normal - state coherence effects properly into account .",
    "the previous theoretical work on the optical conductivity of the underdoped cuprates @xcite is carried out for the one - band models with a particular care devoted to the treatment of strong local correlations responsible for the af structure in the low - frequency conductivity , but no attention was paid to the ( interband ) optical processes in the visible part of the spectra .",
    "the principal physical problem is that when such one - band models are applied to the raman spectra , then the resonant nature of the raman scattering processes is ignored , because the intermediate states in the raman scattering processes are treated in the static approximation .",
    "@xcite the first experimental evidence for the crucial role of the interband processes at @xmath10 ev for the low - frequency physics of the high-@xmath1 cuprates was given by cooper and coworkers @xcite , considering the correlation between the optical excitations across the charge - transfer gap in yba@xmath11cu@xmath12o@xmath13 and the resonant behaviour of the magnetic peak in the @xmath8 raman response .",
    "similar ( but less pronounced ) dependence on the frequency of the incident / scattered photons is also found in the drude part of the raman spectra .",
    "the latter is also accompanied by several anomalies regarding the relative spectral weights of three raman polarizations .",
    "@xcite    actually , the recent interest in the drude part of the optical conductivity and raman scattering spectra of the underdoped compounds is stimulated by the clear evidence for important role of the normal - state coherence effects . the optical conductivity and @xmath9 raman spectra scan the electronic states in the nodal region of the fermi surface ( so - called `` cold spots '' on the fermi surface : @xmath14 ) , while the @xmath7 and @xmath8 raman scattering processes probe the electronic states in the vicinity of the van hove points ( `` hot spots '' ) .",
    "a striking difference between these two groups of spectra occurs for the nearly half filled conduction band in all cases where there is a perturbation peaked at ( usually commensurate ) wave vector * q * close to the nesting vector of the fermi surface @xmath15 .",
    "the af fluctuations at small dopings @xcite and the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) fluctuations at the @xmath16 doping @xcite are typical examples .",
    "there is also a surprising similarity between the mid - infrared ( mir ) peak in the optical conductivity , @xmath17 , and the magnetic peak in the @xmath8 raman spectra .",
    "both appear at nearly the same energy , exhibit similar doping dependence and possibly have the same physical origin .",
    "@xcite    it is interesting also to note that in the materials where the mir peak appears at a relatively small energy , comparable with the typical damping energy @xmath18 @xcite , there is an essential difference between the predictions of the usual one - band optical models and measurements .",
    "it is explicitly shown that the development of the measured mir structure with temperature can be fitted well with the orbital kondo model of emery and kivelson @xcite ( representing the regime where @xmath19 ) rather than with the mentioned one - band models ( underdamped regime : @xmath17 is proportional to characteristic correlation energy scales , such as the hubbard interaction @xmath20 @xcite or the af exchange energy @xmath21 @xcite ) .",
    "the main goal of the present analysis is the following : ( i ) to determine for the emery three - band model @xcite all electron - photon coupling functions ( various current and raman vertices , to be defined below ) important for the understanding of most of the aforementioned anomalies , ( ii ) to show that , due to the gauge invariance , the present multi - component optical model allows a natural transformation of the spectra from the underdamped regime into the overdamped regime , @xcite and ( iii ) to point out that the correlation effects peaked at @xmath22 ( the af correlations in the cuprates , or the umklapp scattering processes in the bechgaard salts @xcite ) affect the optical conductivity of two - dimensional ( 2d ) and quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) systems in a similar way , leading in both cases to the dramatic decrease of the effective number of conduction electrons .",
    "however , to ensure a simple analytic form of the current and raman vertices , the present analysis will be limited by the use of several approximations .",
    "( i ) the effects of the af correlations on the response functions will be included in an adiabatic way .",
    "( ii ) the strong local correlations associated with the hubbard term on the copper sites will be treated in the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) , with the same ( renormalized ) copper - oxygen transfer integral describing the low- and high - frequency excitations .",
    "( iii ) as usual for the in - plane features of the high-@xmath1 cuprates , the 2d representation of the electronic system is used , neglecting several important questions dependent on the electron propagation in the direction perpendicular to the conduction planes , such as the anomalous @xmath23-axis conductivity or the dimensionality crossover .    in this paper ,",
    "the response of the valence electrons in the high-@xmath1 cuprates to the external vector potential is analyzed by means of the emery three - band model @xcite .",
    "the af correlations in the nearly half filled conduction band are modeled by an effective single - particle interaction @xmath24 peaked at the commensurate wave vector @xmath25 . in the calculation",
    "we adopt a gauge invariant approach which has been proved to enable a systematic study of the multi - component optical conductivity spectra @xcite and which is a simple generalization of the memory - function approach @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that an anisotropic-@xmath26 effective interaction results in two distinct features in the low - frequency optical conductivity , with the relation between these two features and the high - frequency excitations across the @xmath27 charge - transfer gap which quantitatively agrees with the experimental observations ( including the position of thresholds and the ratio between the respective spectral weights ) .    in section 2",
    "we describe the simplest version of the three - band model which focuses on the optical excitations across the @xmath27 charge - transfer gap and on the low - frequency excitations across the mir correlation gap @xmath28 ( in the rest of the text the mir conductivity related to @xmath29 will be referred to as the mir gap structure ) , and review other work .",
    "we determine the gauge invariant form of the static and elastic raman vertices ( appendices a and b ) , which makes possible the consistent formulation of both the three - component optical conductivity and the related raman correlation functions .",
    "section 3.1 discusses the conductivity sum rules of the present three - component optical model , while in section 3.2 the dependence of the low - frequency spectra on the symmetry and magnitude of the effective interaction @xmath24 is studied .",
    "finally , the mutually competing effects of the intracell hybridizations and the strong local correlations on the interband spectra of the lightly - doped conducting planes are briefly discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the electrodynamics of valence electrons in the high-@xmath1 cuprates is described in terms of the extended hubbard model ( i.e. the emery three - band model @xcite in which all coulomb interactions are neglected except for the hubbard interaction on the copper sites @xmath30 ) .",
    "as mentioned in introduction , various one - band versions of this model have been widely used to describe qualitatively the low - frequency optical conductivity .",
    "let us first briefly review these models . then follow the detailed explanation of the present optical model and the comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the theoretical study of the underdoped regime reveals the mir gap structure in the optical conductivity , in accordance with experimental observation . in the one - band hubbard model",
    "@xcite the corresponding threshold energy is proportional to the hubbard interaction @xmath20 ( precisely , @xmath31 , with an additional , charge - transfer gap at @xmath32 ) , while in the @xmath33-@xmath21 model @xcite this energy is related to the af exchange energy @xmath21 .",
    "most of the relevant results are calculated using the _ numerical _ diagonalization procedure at _ high temperatures _",
    "( usually @xmath34 k ) .",
    "similarly , the anomalous ( non - drude , single - component ) optical conductivity measured in the overdoped compounds can be explained in terms of the marginal fermi liquid theory @xcite or the nested fermi liquid theory @xcite , which are characterized by strong quasi - particle damping effects .",
    "it is essential to notice that fits of the related generalized drude formula to the measured spectra require usually _ large damping energies _",
    "( typically @xmath35 @xcite ) .",
    "in order to treat both the local correlations related to @xmath30 and the interplay between various small energy scales more accurately ( at low temperatures , with presumably small damping energies ) , as well as to describe the relevant intracell processes explicitly , different three - band versions of the emery model are examined and contrasted to the measured low- and high - frequency optical spectra and the related raman spectra @xcite .",
    "kotliar , lee and read @xcite have calculated the ground state energy of the electronic system self - consistently using the slave - boson procedure .",
    "they have shown that the characteristic of the low - frequency optical processes is the renormalization of the copper - oxygen bond energy @xmath36 ( i.e. the copper - oxygen transfer integral , in the usual language ) .",
    "this renormalized bond energy is found to be strongly dependent on doping , in particular in the lightly doped region , where @xmath37 ( hereafter , @xmath38 is the hole doping ) . in the case where @xmath39 , the mir structure is found to be related to the renormalized splitting between the oxygen and copper site energies , @xmath40 ( i.e. the renormalized @xmath27 dimerization potential ) @xcite .",
    "however , in the complete slave - boson model @xcite this scale can be associated with the af exchange energy @xmath21 as well . in both cases , the excitations across the charge - transfer gap",
    "are connected with the bare @xmath27 dimerization potential .",
    "the electrodynamics of the underdoped cuprates may be close to that of the bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath11x clo@xmath3 ) .",
    "namely , for the nearly half filled 2d or q1d conduction band , the sc and af ( or spin - density wave ) regions in the phase diagram are expected to be controlled by small changes in the already small effective number of conduction electrons caused by the interplay between the corresponding correlation energy and various other small energy scales .",
    "@xcite the measurements on the high quality crystals @xcite have shown that the electrodynamic features of the bechgaard salts are strongly affected by the umklapp scattering processes , in particular by the competition between the characteristic umklapp energy and the transfer integral in the direction perpendicular to the highly conducting direction @xcite . in the present paper",
    "it will be proposed that the two - component low - frequency optical conductivity of the underdoped cuprates is connected with a similar correlation energy related to the af pseudogap processes , and that the transformation of this two - component form into a single - component form , in the overdoped regime , is related with the interplay between this scale and the energy difference between the fermi energy and the van hove energy . by analogy with the bechgaard salts",
    ", one should extend the present analysis by considering the competition between the characteristic af energy and the oxygen - oxygen transfer integral @xmath41 ( this is expected to be relevant for the in - plane conductivity in the lightly - doped regime ) , or the interplane transfer integral @xmath42 ( important for the @xmath23-axis conductivity and the dimensionality crossover problem ) ; however , these are beyond the scope of the present work .    finally , it is important to note that the present optical conductivity analysis , together with the related raman analysis @xcite , can be easily connected with the hall coefficient measurements @xcite , due particularly to the analytic form of the intra- and interband current and raman vertex functions .",
    "it should also be noticed that the model parameters extracted below from the optical data can be confirmed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments @xcite ( the conduction band is wide and nearly half filled ) , as well as by electric field gradient ( efg ) measurements @xcite ( the copper - oxygen hybridization is relatively strong , again , supporting the picture of wide bands @xcite ) .",
    "the present response theory is based on an effective single - particle description of the valence electrons .",
    "the analysis starts with the 2d three - band hamiltonian of the form @xcite @xmath43 in the hole picture , the bonding band ( the band index @xmath44 ) is nearly half filled , while the antibonding and nonbonding bands ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) are empty .",
    "two versions of the model will be considered .",
    "the model a includes only two parameters , the splitting between the oxygen @xmath47 and copper @xmath48 site energies @xmath40 and the average first - neighbor bond energy @xmath36 .",
    "since two different limits of the three - band model , the @xmath49 limit and the mfa of the @xmath50 limit ( hereafter , the large @xmath51 case ) , are represented by this model , the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath36 can be associated either with the bare parameters or with the parameters renormalized by the large @xmath51 ( in the latter case , the present model is identical to the original slave - boson model of kotliar , lee and read @xcite ) .",
    "the distinction between these two situations , together with a naive phenomenological extension of the large @xmath30 problem , will be briefly discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "the model b focuses on the bonding band only , i.e. on an effective low - frequency description of the conduction electrons .",
    "so long as the underdoped regime is in question , the main low - frequency effects are expected to come from an opening of a correlation gap in the single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "these effects are related here to the af correlations and are described in the adiabatic way , by considering the influence of an effective single - particle interaction @xmath52 \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the real part of the electron self - energy , with @xmath53 being the af wave vector .",
    "although the effect of these correlations on the imaginary part of the electron self - energy is not treated explicitly , it can be represented by a phenomenological contribution to the damping energies which increases linearly with frequency ( see a comment on the generalized drude formula given below ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath24 is assumed to be real and small , as compared with the energies @xmath40 and @xmath36 .",
    "the structure of the bloch functions and the bloch energies of the model a is well known @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the diagonalization of the model b ( i.e. of the hamiltonian @xmath54 ) is straightforward , leading to the dimerized bonding band with the dispersions of the upper ( @xmath55 ) and lower ( @xmath56 ) subbands given by @xmath57   \\nonumber \\\\ & &   \\pm \\sqrt { \\frac{1}{4 } [ e_d ( { \\bf k } ) - e_{\\underline{d } } ( { \\bf k})]^2     + \\delta^2({\\bf k } ) } ,   % \\nonumber \\\\ \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 . the effect of the perturbation @xmath59 on the bloch functions is given in the usual way , in terms of the auxiliary phase @xmath60 defined in appendix b.      according to ref .",

    "the underdoped crystals exhibit the behaviour which can not be described as the response of a drude metal .",

    "second , we illustrate the dependence of the low - frequency optical conductivity on the symmetry and magnitude of af pseudogap .",
    "finally , the validity of the model ( [ eq5])@xmath82([eq8 ] ) in the lightly doped regime is tested on comparing the experimental spectra measured at @xmath127 ev to the ones which correspond to the model parameters independent of doping .",
    "the characteristic energy scales used in the numerical calculations , @xmath128 ev and @xmath129 ev , are deduced from the estimate of the intracell hybridization @xmath130 @xcite obtained on the basis of the intracell charge distributions measured in the la@xmath73sr@xmath74cuo@xmath3 compounds by the efg probes , and by assuming that the charge - transfer energy is roughly equal to 1.75 ev for the doping level @xmath131 .",

    "finally , one can also notice that , when the doping level is reduced well below @xmath176 , the effective number of charge carriers obtained by the expression ( [ eq6 ] ) can be adequately described by the free - hole approximation .",
    "the effective number of holes is small with respect to the number of electrons in the conduction band , @xmath177 .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) , together with the definition of the static raman vertex , is the relevant expression to reconcile the concept of large fermi surfaces , supported by the arpes experiments , with the small effective number of holes , estimated from the drude spectral weight or from the associated electron plasma frequency ( the measured plasma frequencies are indicated in fig .",

    "2 , the above description of the mir correlations becomes ineffective for the magnitude @xmath76 small in comparison with the energy difference between the fermi energy and the van hove energy , @xmath179 .",
    "in such circumstances , the two - component low - frequency optical conductivity , characterized by the distinct mir threshold energy , will transform into a nearly single - component form with the increasing role of the frequency dependent corrections to the intraband damping energy @xcite .",

    "second , in the present model , where the second - neighbor bond - energy @xmath41 is set to zero , the anomalous shift of the mir peak structure with decreasing doping can only be understood as a result of the doping dependent magnitude @xmath76 .",

    "when fitted with @xmath128 ev and @xmath129 ev , the model ( [ eq5 ] ) underestimates the interband spectral weight of the considered compounds nearly by a factor @xmath198(1.5ev ) .",

    "are desired as a function of the doping level and with a better resolution of the low - frequency part of the spectra .",
    "theoretically , one needs more accurate investigation of the relations between the low - frequency optical conductivity and the raman and arpes spectra .",

    "in this article , the influence of two dimerization potentials on the optical response of the valence electrons in the high-@xmath1 cuprates has been studied , starting from the model parameters independent of doping .",
    "it is found that for the nearly half filled conduction band the @xmath27 dimerization potential leads to the spectral weights of the intra- and interband channels nearly equal to each other .",
    "it is also shown that at optimum doping the effective correlation potential related to the af pseudogap processes results in the non - drude nearly single - component low - frequency optical conductivity .",
    "it is argued that , due to the decrease in the effective number of conduction electrons , the low - frequency conductivity transforms naturally from a single - component into a two - component structure with decreasing doping . both of these results are found to be in accordance with experimental observation in the lightly - doped and underdoped la@xmath11cuo@xmath3 based compounds . in the present model ( where the bond energy @xmath41 is set to zero ) ,",
    "the pronounced doping dependence of the mir peak structure is attributed to the doping dependent magnitude of the characteristic af energy .",
    "finally , the substantial increase of the interband spectral weight at small doping levels is interpreted in the framework of the conductivity sum rules as an indirect evidence on the strong renormalizations of the parameters describing the low - frequency physics .",
