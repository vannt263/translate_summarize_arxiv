    "what is the influence of the curvature of space on the dynamics of a fluid ?",
    "this question arises in several physical situations , such as colloidal assemblies on droplets in particle - stabilized ( pickering ) emulsions @xcite or fluid monolayers adsorbed on large solid particles @xcite . according to the frustration - based theory of glass - forming liquids @xcite , depending on the dimension of space and the nature of the liquid , curvature may induce or release `` geometric frustration '' and therefore affect the ability to form glassy phases and the slowdown of relaxation . for spherical particles in 2 dimensions ,",
    "hexagonal or hexatic @xmath0-fold order is prevalent in flat ( euclidean ) space , and a constant nonzero curvature thwarts the long - range or quasi - long - range ordering by forcing in an irreducible density of topological defects @xcite . at high density and/or low temperature the particle configurations",
    "then consist of a hexatic background interrupted by topological defects in the form of finite - length strings known as `` grain boundary scars '' @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , there is a strong slowing down of the dynamics as one lowers the temperature or increases the density .",
    "one may wonder if this dynamical slowdown is similar or not to that of conventional glass - forming liquids ?    here we address these questions through a study of the dynamics of a one - component atomic liquid embedded in a 2-sphere , _",
    "i.e. _ , a surface of constant positive curvature , by molecular dynamics simulation and the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) .",
    "the mct of glass formation was developed in the mid-80s in the context of the theory of simple liquids @xcite . in its canonical version",
    "the mct predicts the dynamics of a system from the mere knowledge of the static pair correlation function or static structure factor .",
    "it is a mean - field - like theory of the glass transition which predicts a dynamical , ergodic to nonergodic , transition that is not observed in real glass - formers in finite dimensions where it is ( at best ) replaced by a crossover . due to the absence of singularity in finite dimensions , the predictions are not quantitatively accurate ( @xmath1 is typically overestimated by a factor of @xmath2 in simple glass - forming systems ) .",
    "nonetheless , the mct appears to correctly capture the observed trends of the dynamics in physical situations where a significant change in the static structure factor is encountered , as , _",
    "e.g. _ , in attractive colloids and other soft - matter systems@xcite .",
    "the points we have therefore investigated within a generalization of the mct for a spherical geometry are the following :    \\1 ) is the predicted dynamical transition governed by a different type of singularity than that found for standard glass - forming liquids ?",
    "for instance , it has been predicted that glass - forming liquids confined in disordered porous media may display within the mct , depending on the model parameters , a continuous ( a - type ) transition different from the discontinuous ( b - type ) one observed in bulk glass - formers @xcite .",
    "is a similar phenomenon encountered for particles on a sphere due to specificities of the kinetics of the grain boundary scars moving in a random and slower evolving hexatic environment ?",
    "\\2 ) is the mct able to predict the variation of the slowing down of relaxation with curvature ? to make the comparison more quantitative ,",
    "we have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of a model one - component liquid on @xmath3 with several values of the curvature , parametrized by the ratio of the radius of the embedding sphere over the particle diameter , and we have fitted the numerical data according to mct predictions .",
    "we find that the mct singularity on @xmath3 is actually of the same type as that in euclidean space .",
    "thus , as seen from the mct , there is nothing special about glass formation in curved space , which make liquids in curved space _ bona fide _",
    "models for studying the generic features of the glass transition . as for the answer to the second question ,",
    "we conclude that the mct predicts the right trend , with the the slowdown becoming more marked as curvature is reduced .",
    "however , the effect is found to be much too weak when compared to the simulation data .",
    "this is another example @xcite where the mct is unable to properly amplify the small changes seen in the static pair structure to describe the observed strong differences in dynamics .",
