    "although legged robots have already been studied in robotics @xcite , only a very few papers consider the motion planning problem amidst obstacles  @xcite . in  @xcite some heuristic approaches are described while , in  @xcite efficient and provably correct geometric algorithms are described for a restricted type of legged robots , the so - called spider robots to be defined precisely below , and for finite sets of point footholds .    a _ legged robot _ consists of a body with legs .",
    "each leg has one end attached to the body and the other end ( called the foot ) that can lie on the ground ( or move in space between two positions on the ground ) .",
    "compared to the classic piano movers problem , legged robots introduce new types of constraints .",
    "we assume that the environment consists of regions in the plane , called _ foothold regions _ , where the robot can safely put its feet .",
    "a _ foothold _ is a point in a foothold region .",
    "the legged robot must satisfy two different constraints : the accessibility and the stability constraints .",
    "a foothold is said to be _ accessible _ from a _ placement _ ( position of the body of the robot ) if it can be reached by a leg of the robot .",
    "a placement is called _ stable _ if there exist accessible footholds and if the center of mass of the robot lies above the convex hull of these accessible footholds .",
    "the set of stable placements is clearly relevant for planning the motion of a legged robot : we call this set _ the free space _ of the legged robot",
    ". note that a legged robot has at least four legs , three legs ensure the stability of a placement and a fourth leg permits the motion of the robot .",
    "a first simple instance of a legged robot is the _ spider robot _ ( see figure  [ spider - plan ] ) .",
    "the spider robot was inspired by ambler , developed at carnegie mellon university  @xcite .",
    "the body of the spider robot is a single point in the euclidean plane and all its legs are attached to the body .",
    "the legs are retractable and their lengths may vary between @xmath13 and a constant @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that the center of mass of the robot is its body .",
    "it follows that a placement is stable if the body of the robot lies above the convex hull of the accessible footholds .",
    "the constraint that the body of the spider robot lies in the plane ( instead of in 3d ) is not really restrictive .",
    "indeed , consider a legged robot for which that constraint is relaxed .",
    "then , if a placement @xmath14 of such a legged robot is stable then , any placement @xmath15 , @xmath16 is also stable .",
    "reciprocally , it can be shown that if @xmath17 is in the interior of the free space of the spider robot , then there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath14 is a stable placement of the corresponding legged robot .",
    "the problem of planning the motion of a spider robot has already been studied by boissonnat et al .",
    "however , their method assumes that the set of footholds is a finite set of points and can not be generalized to more complex environments .",
    "this paper proposes a new method for computing the free space of a spider robot in the presence of polygonal foothold regions .",
    "this method is based on a transformation between this problem and the problem of moving a half - disk amidst obstacles .",
    "our method requires the computation of some parts of the free space of the half - disk .",
    "these computations are rather technical and complicated .",
    "consequently , for the sake of clarity , we first present our algorithm for the simple case of discrete footholds , then we show how it can be generalized to the case of polygonal foothold regions .",
    "once the free space of the spider robot has been computed , it can be used to find trajectories and sequences of legs assignments allowing the robot to move from one point to another . indeed ,",
    "once the free space is known , a trajectory of the body can be found in the free space .",
    "then , a sequence of legs assignments can be computed as follows ( see  @xcite for details ) . given an initial legs assignment , the body of the robot moves along its trajectory until it crosses the convex hull of its ( three ) feet that are on the ground or one leg reaches its maximal extension .",
    "then , a suitable foothold is found for the fourth leg and one leg leaves its foothold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : some notations and results of  @xcite are recalled in the next section .",
    "section  [ fsrthdr ] shows the transformation between the spider robot problem and the half - disk problem .",
    "we present in section  [ computation_of_f ] our algorithm for computing the free space of a spider robot for a discrete set of footholds .",
    "section  [ polygonal - foothold - regions ] shows how to extend the algorithm to polygonal foothold regions .",
    "in sections 2 , 3 and 4 ,   denotes a discrete set of distinct footholds @xmath19 in the euclidean plane (   will denote in section  5 a set of disjoint polygonal regions ) .",
    "point @xmath20 denotes the body of the robot ( in the same plane ) and @xmath21 $ ] is the length range of each leg .",
    "the free space @xmath0  is the set of all stable placements of @xmath20 .",
    "a placement is said to be at the _ limit of stability _ if it lies on the boundary of the convex hull of its accessible footholds . notice that @xmath0  is a closed set and contains the placements at the limit of stability .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the circle of radius @xmath1 centered at @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24  is the arrangement of the circles @xmath22 for @xmath25 , i.e. , the subdivision of the plane induced by the circles .",
    "this arrangement plays an important role in our problem and we will express the complexity results in term of @xmath26 , the size of @xmath27 . in the worst - case , @xmath28 but if @xmath29 denotes the maximum number of disks that can cover a point of the plane , among the disks of radius @xmath1 centered at the @xmath30 , it can be shown that @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "clearly @xmath29 is not larger than @xmath5 and in case of sparse footholds , @xmath26 may be linearly related to the number of footholds .    for any set @xmath32 ,",
    "let @xmath33 denote its boundary , @xmath34 its convex hull , @xmath35 its relative interior in a space @xmath36 is the interior of @xmath32 in the space @xmath32 for the topology induced by @xmath36 .",
    "for example , the relative interior of a closed line segment in @xmath37 is the line segment without its endpoints , though its interior in @xmath37 is empty . ]",
    ", @xmath38 its closure , and @xmath39 its complementary set .",
    "let @xmath40 denote the set of angles @xmath41 .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 $ ] the equality of @xmath43 and @xmath44 modulo @xmath45 .",
    "we say in the sequel that two objects _ properly intersect _ if and only if their relative interiors intersect .",
    "the algorithm described in  @xcite is based on the following observation : for @xmath20 in a cell @xmath46  of @xmath27 , the set of footholds that can be reached by the robot is fixed ; the portion of @xmath46  that belongs to @xmath0  is exactly the intersection of @xmath46  with the convex hull of the footholds that can be reached from @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , the edges of @xmath48  are either circular arcs belonging to @xmath24  or portions of line segments joining two footholds .",
    "moreover , a vertex of @xmath48  incident to two straight edges is a foothold ( see figure  [ exemple - f-2 ] ) .",
    "the complexity of @xmath0  has been proved to be @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm presented in  @xcite computes the free space @xmath0  in @xmath50 time .",
    "it uses sophisticated data structures allowing the off - line maintenance of convex hulls .",
    "the algorithm described in this paper has the same time complexity , uses simple data structures and can be extended to the case where the set   of footholds is a set of polygonal regions and not simply a set of points . for simplicity , we consider first the case of point footholds and postpone the discussion on polygonal foothold regions to section  [ polygonal - foothold - regions ] .      to simplify the presentation of this paper",
    ", we make the following general position assumptions .",
    "all these hypotheses can be removed by a careful analysis . recall that we consider here that the set of footholds is discrete .",
    "no two footholds lie at distance exactly @xmath1 or @xmath51 . among the circles @xmath52 and the line segments joining two footholds , the intersection between three circles or , two circles and a line segment or , one circle and two line segments , is empty .",

    "therefore , by considering , in addition , all the closed curves of @xmath480 that do not intersect @xmath457 , we finally obtain a set @xmath567 of closed curves that contains @xmath414  and such that any curve of @xmath567 is either a connected component of @xmath414  or is strictly included in @xmath405 .    at last , as we can simply determine , for each curve of @xmath567 , a side of the edge that belongs to @xmath405 , we can easily deduce from @xmath567 the free space @xmath405 .",
    "that concludes the proof since all these computations can be done in @xmath563 time using @xmath456 space .    as we said at the beginning of section  [ polygonal - foothold - regions ] , the free space of the spider robot using as foothold regions a set of polygonal regions is obtained by adding these polygonal regions to @xmath405 .",
    "this does not increase the geometric complexity of the free space nor the complexity of the computation .",
    "thus , we get the following theorem :    [ er ] given a set of pairwise disjoint polygonal foothold regions with @xmath5 edges in total that satisfies hypotheses h1 , h2 , h3 and h4 , we can compute the free space @xmath0  of the spider robot in @xmath563 time using @xmath456 space .",
    "the function @xmath10 is extremely slowly growing and can be considered as a small constant in practical situations .",
    "this result is almost optimal since , as shown in  @xcite , @xmath568 is a lower bound for the size of @xmath12 .",
    "we have seen in theorem  [ r ] that , when the foothold regions are @xmath5 points in the plane , the free space of the spider robot can be computed in @xmath50 time using @xmath394 space where @xmath6 is the pseudo inverse of the ackerman s function and @xmath24the arrangement of the @xmath5 circles of radius @xmath1 centered at the footholds . by",
    "@xcite the size of @xmath0  is known to be @xmath569 .",
    "the size of @xmath24  is @xmath570 but it has been shown in  @xcite that @xmath571 , where @xmath29 denotes the maximum number of disks of radius @xmath1 centered at the footholds that can cover a point of the plane .",
    "thus , in case of sparse footholds , the sizes of @xmath24  and @xmath0  are linearly related to the number of footholds .",
    "when the foothold regions are polygons with @xmath5 edges in total , the free space of the spider robot can be computed in @xmath563 time using @xmath456 space , where @xmath572 is the maximum length of a davenport - schinzel sequence of order @xmath29 on @xmath5 symbols , and @xmath411  is the arrangement of the @xmath5 curves consisting of the points lying at distance @xmath1 from the straight line edges . note that the size of @xmath411  is @xmath570 .",
    "it should be observed that , in the case of point footholds , our algorithm implies that @xmath394 is an upper bound for @xmath573 .",
    "however , this bound is not tight since @xmath49  @xcite . in the case of polygonal footholds",
    ", our analysis implies that @xmath456 is an upper bound for @xmath573 .",
    "we leave as an open problem to close the ( small ) gap between this upper bound and the @xmath568 lower bound .",
    "once the free space @xmath0  is known , several questions can be answered . in particular ,",
    "given two points in the same connected component of @xmath12 , the algorithm in  @xcite computes a motion of the spider robot , i.e. , a motion of the body and a corresponding sequence of leg assignments that allows the robot to move from one point to the other .",
    "the motion planning problem for other types of legged robots remains to be studied .",
    "the case where all the legs are not attached at the same point on a polygonal / polyhedral body is particularly relevant .",
    "a spider robot for which all the legs are not of the same length is also an interesting model .",
    "we would like to thank joseph orourke for helpful comments ."
