    "low - lying energy levels of kaonic atoms are shifted and broadened due to the strong interaction between the antikaon and nucleus .",
    "these shifts and widths are fundamental data for studies of the low - energy @xmath9 interaction , and generally of low - energy qcd in the strangeness sector . although kaonic atom x - ray data have been taken using many target materials , little was known about kaonic atoms with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "concerning kaonic helium , no data was available for kaonic @xmath0he , while , until recently , for kaonic @xmath12he there was a discrepancy between experimental results and theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy was eventually solved in recent years by the e570 and siddharta experiments @xcite , where reliable experimental data were obtained .",
    "as soon as a low - energy kaon beam , allowing the use of gaseous target , and fast - timing x - ray detectors became available , for the first time , kaonic @xmath0he x - rays could be measured by the siddharta experiment .",
    "the siddharta experiment uses low - energy kaons generated by the da@xmath5ne collider , which may be stopped efficiently in a gaseous target in a small volume .",
    "large - area silicon drift detectors ( sdds )  developed in the framework of the siddharta collaboration  were used as x - ray detectors for the first time at a collider machine . using these sdds , it was possible to determine x - ray energies with a precision of a few ev in the energy range up to about 10 kev , based on high suppression of background events .    in this paper",
    ", we report on this first measurement of the kaonic @xmath0he x - rays , which is extremely important in view of a possible shift of the kaonic @xmath0he @xmath7 level , as well as a possible isotope difference of the @xmath7 level shifts between kaonic @xmath0he and @xmath12he depending on the strength of the @xmath2-@xmath0he and @xmath2-@xmath12he interaction @xcite .",
    "the siddharta setup was installed at the @xmath6 interaction point of the da@xmath5ne collider .",

    "the gas was contained in a cylindrical target cell ( with a radius of 72 mm , and a height of 155 mm ) , made of 75-@xmath13 m thick kapton foils .",
    "large area silicon - drift detectors ( sdds ) having an active area of 1 @xmath14 each and a thickness of 450 @xmath13 m @xcite were used for x - ray detection .",
    "a total active area of 144 @xmath14 was installed with a distance of 78 mm between the sdds and the target central axis .",
    "the sdds were cooled to a temperature of 170 k with a stability of @xmath15 k.    the positions at which the sdds were installed differed from those in the setup used for kaonic @xmath12he in @xcite .",
    "together with a larger size of the target , the acceptance of the sdds was improved by a factor of about 2.6 .",
    "@xmath3 pairs produced by @xmath4 decay were detected by two scintillators installed above and below the beam pipe at the interaction point ( called `` the kaon detector '' ) .",
    "the scintillator installed below the beam pipe has a size of 72 @xmath16 72 mm@xmath17 and a thickness of 1.5 mm , while the one installed above the pipe has a smaller size of 49 @xmath16 45 mm@xmath17 and a thickness of 1.5 mm . above the upper scintillator",
    "a degrader was installed to degrade the kaon energy so that the @xmath2 mesons are stopped in the @xmath0he target volume .",
    "high intensity x - ray lines for energy calibration were periodically provided by irradiating thin foils of titanium and copper with an x - ray tube to excite them .",
    "they were installed at the interaction point , replacing the kaon detector .",
    "two types of data were taken with the @xmath18 beams .",
    "the first type ( `` production '' data ) is data taken with the kaon detector and degrader , to be used for collection of kaonic atom x - ray events .",
    "the second type ( `` x - ray tube '' data ) is data taken with the x - ray tube and the ti and cu foils .",
    "these x - ray tube data were taken periodically ( typically every several hours ) , to be used for the determination of the energy scale of each sdd , and for monitoring temporal changes in the positions of the ti and cu x - ray peaks .",
    "energy data of all the x - ray signals detected by the sdds were recorded using a specially designed data acquisition system .",
    "time differences between the x - ray signals in the sdds and the coincidence signals in the kaon detector were recorded using clock signals with a frequency of 120 mhz , whenever the x - ray signals occurred within a time window of 6 @xmath13s .",
    "in addition , time differences between the coincidence signals in the kaon detector and the clock pulses delivered by da@xmath5ne were recorded .",
    "the kaonic @xmath0he x - ray data were taken for about 4 days in november of 2009 . in this period ,",
    "an integrated luminosity of 17 pb@xmath19 was collected , which corresponds to about @xmath20 kaons detected by the kaon detector .",
    "first , the x - ray tube data were analyzed .",
    "energy spectra of each sdd contain ti and cu k@xmath21 peaks with high statistics , mainly induced by radiation from the x - ray tube .",
    "since each sdd has a different gain , the energy scale was determined using the known x - ray energies of the ti and cu lines .",
    "in addition , sdds having good performance were selected , based on energy resolution , peak shape , and stability during the measurements @xcite . the energy spectrum of the x - ray tube data is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , where data of all the selected sdds were summed .",
    "more detailed information can be found in @xcite .",
    "the production data were then analyzed using the energy scale determined from the x - ray tube data after corrections for temporal fluctuations of the peak positions .",
    "the production data are categorized as two types , based on whether or not the coincidence signals between the sdd and kaon detector occurred within a coincidence window of 6 @xmath13s .",
    "one type contains x - ray events correlated with the kaon coincidence ( triple coincidence data ) , providing kaonic atom x - ray energy spectra with a high background suppression .",
    "the other type contains x - ray events uncorrelated with the kaon coincidence ( non - coincidence data ) , providing large statistics of background events , as well as x - ray lines from the target materials induced by the beam background .",
    "figure [ fig3](b ) shows the energy spectrum of the non - coincidence data .",
    "the ti and cu peaks are seen at an energy of 4.5 kev and 8.0 kev , respectively .",
    "these peaks were produced by the ti and cu foils installed on the top of the target , as well as by the ti foil , which is a part of the degrader .",
    "in addition , the au l@xmath21 line is seen at 9.7 kev , which was produced by the material of the sdd support structure .",
    "the mn k@xmath21 and fe k@xmath21 peaks were seen at 5.9 kev and 6.4 kev , which were produced by a @xmath22fe source and the fe foil installed on the top of the degrader during part of the measurement .",
    "the accuracy of the energy scale in the production data was evaluated using the peak positions of the ti , cu , and au lines . for the evaluation ,",
    "the data taken with other target gases in the same experimental setup were also used , to reduce the effect of statistical fluctuations in the peak positions . in the fit of these lines ,",
    "x - ray energies determined by high - resolution measurements were used as reference values @xcite , where their natural linewidth and asymmetric components were also taken into account .    as a result of the fit , the energy scale in the production data",
    "is shifted by @xmath23 ev compared to the reference data .",
    "the accuracy of the energy determination was @xmath24 ev in the energy region from 4 kev to 10 kev @xcite .",
    "this shift is due to the instability of our electronics caused by differing conditions between the production and x - ray tube data .",
    "the largest contribution is a rate - dependent effect on the sdds .",
    "the hit rate of the sdds in the x - ray tube data was about 10 times higher than that in the production data , causing the observed shift .",
    "the shift needs a correction to determine x - ray energies on an absolute energy scale . a value on the absolute energy scale ( @xmath25 ) is calculated by adding the correction term ( @xmath26 ) to a fit value in the production data ( @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29 the uncertainty of @xmath30 is used for the evaluation of a systematic error in the energy determination .",
