    "*    our definition of compressibility deviates from the definition of compressibility in the quantum - hall effect community since the derivative of the density is taken against a gate voltage and not the chemical potential ( position of the fermi level ) .",
    "such a definition is not suitable in our case since electrons on helium form a non - degenerate electron gas and the fermi - energy is much smaller than temperature and is therefore not a relevant parameter , instead we have used the electrostatic potential which is controlled by @xmath130 .",
    "we note that our experimental technique is otherwise very similar to the capacitive measurements performed on gaas two - dimensional electron gas to determine the compressibility .",

    "we would also like to emphasize that as @xmath130 decreases the electron gas is progressively compressed towards the center of the electron cloud , which is the expected behavior in a compressibility experiment .",
    "thus we believe that the use of the term compressibility is fully justified .",
    "finally our definition of compressibility may seem non - local since it involves the derivative against the potential of the guard electrode @xmath130 instead of the potential of the potential of the central electrode @xmath131 .",
    "actually only the difference @xmath132 is important for the electron distribution profile , thus the two definitions are in principle equivalent .",
    "our motivation for choosing @xmath130 as the main control parameter is that we wanted to keep the perpendicular field constant during our measurements , and it is much easier to fix the potential of the top guard electrode @xmath133 ensuring that @xmath134 is constant , than to change the potential of the top central electrodes , which are grounded through the current amplifiers .    * supplementary note 2 .",

    "the oscillation amplitude @xmath138 of the charge on the top central electrode then can be expressed as : @xmath139    this equation assumes that electrons are distributed midway between top and bottom electrodes separated by distance @xmath140 .",
    "we ensured that this was indeed the case by adjusting the liquid helium level to @xmath141 during the filling of the sample cell using capacitance measurements . under these conditions",
    "it is strictly valid for an homogeneous charge distribution below the disc for which the density gradients are located at least a screening length @xmath140 away from the electrode edges .",
    "this is the case without microwave irradiation since the density gradients are located at @xmath142 .",

    "( [ eqdeltaq ] ) . the influence of wavenumbers for which @xmath144 will be exponentially suppressed by the screening from the electrodes .",
    "the effect of wavenumbers satisfying @xmath145 will also be reduced by the averaging over the surface of the measuring electrode . at longer wavelengths @xmath146",
    "the charge density is almost uniform and the error is also expected to be weak .",
    "thus we expect this relation to stay valid for a large range of wave - numbers @xmath143 .",
    "a possible source of charge density oscillation is the fluctuation of the microwave field on the microwave - wavelength scale @xmath147 . for this case",
    "we have @xmath148 and @xmath149 we thus expect the effect of the charge modulations to be strongly suppressed as compared to the changes in the average charge density .",
    "the change in the charge accumulated on the electrodes is related to the current measured with the current amplifier as follows : @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the modulation frequency .",
    "this relation assumes a quasi - static limit where the charges follow the external driving . in a lumped - element approximation",
    "this is valid provided the modulation frequency @xmath151 is sufficiently low : @xmath152 . here",
    "@xmath153 is the inverse of the longitudinal conductivity of the electron cloud and @xmath154 is the coupling capacitance . from our measurements using the sommer - tanner technique without microwaves",

    "we performed our compressibility measurements at @xmath159 , thus the inverse conductivity @xmath153 of the electron cloud can only affect our measurements when @xmath160 is suppressed by around two orders of magnitude compared with its equilibrium value . as discussed in the main text , the compressibility measurement can not distinguish between a vanishing conductivity state with @xmath161 in which carriers do not respond to the external driving owing to their very long response times and an `` active '' mechanism stabilizing the density at a fixed value independent on the applied electrostatic potentials .",
    "we note that the photocurrent experiment ( fig .",
    "5 from the main text ) allows us to distinguish between these two scenarios by showing that the cloud reaches the same steady state density under irradiation independently on the initial density giving a strong argument in favor of an `` active '' mechanism .    combining equations eqs .",

    "the system will stay trapped on the same branch after crossing the discontinuity and the density jump will no longer be correlated with the small voltage modulation @xmath137 . in this case",
    "the discontinuity may completely disappear from the compressibility traces . in all cases",

    "we denote @xmath164 the potential of the electron cloud and assumes that the electron cloud extends to both reservoirs , in the plane condensator approximation the charge densities in the central and guard region are : @xmath165 in these equations we neglected the contribution of the dielectric constant of liquid helium which is close to one within a few percent error .",
    "another way of deriving these equations is by minimization of the charging energy , this derivation also allows us to treat naturally the case where one of the reservoirs is fully depleted under the action of the gate potentials .",
    "this equation connects the change in the electron density under irradiation and the photo - current : @xmath174 where integration is performed over the time interval in which the irradiation is switched off .",
    "this equation is derived by combining eq .",
    "( [ eqdeltaq ] ) with @xmath175 where the ratio is taken in the sense of a time derivative .",
    "the assumptions behind this equation are in practice slightly different from the assumptions behind eq .",
    "( [ eq1main ] ) , indeed since integration is performed over the off phase of the microwave cycle the dynamics of the electrons is known from the dark state properties and the only unknown is the state under microwave irradiation from which relaxation back to equilibrium starts .",
    "we thus expect this relation to be less sensitive to short wave - length fluctuations since they will quickly relax back to a homogeneous density without irradiation . since the two relations correspond to slightly different assumptions on the unknown steady state under irradiation , it is important to ensure that they produce consistent results ( this is shown in figs .",

    "we have not focussed on this regime in the main text since it appears when incompressible region @xmath47 with fixed @xmath204 and region @xmath48 with fixed @xmath230 merge into the same @xmath130 range .",
    "it is thus a consequence of the interaction between the two regions and corresponds to a more complex regime in which the electron system can not reach a stable final state by increasing the density in one of the reservoirs .",

    "<S> [ figipv ] suggests that in region @xmath48 the transition to an incompressible state occurs owning to the pinning of the density inside the guard region . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the incompressible phase , the electron cloud transfers electrons from a high density reservoir region , increasing the density in the low - density regions up to a plateau value .    _ discussion _    </S>",
    "<S> since the formation of a non - equilibrium density profile increases the electron - electron repulsion energy , it is important to estimate the associated energy cost . using the simplified electrostatic model ( see supplementary note 5 for a detailed derivation ) , we find that the energy cost of the redistribution per electron @xmath99 is approximately : @xmath100 from the experimental values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( estimated at point @xmath103 on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figipv ] ) , we find @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this large electrostatic barrier , can explain why the incompressible regions occupy a narrower @xmath7 range in the photocurrent data than in the compressibility measurement : for example region @xmath47 has a width at least 0.6 volt in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figchimw ] but a width of only 0.3 volt in fig .  [ figipv ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main difference between the two techniques is that during compressibility measurements microwaves are always present , maintaining the system in a non - equilibrium state , whereas in the photocurrent measurement the microwave on / off pulses continuously reset the system back to its equilibrium state . </S>",
    "<S> thus in the photocurrent measurements , the electrons must overcome an increasingly large energy barrier to reach the incompressible state as @xmath7 increases . </S>",
    "<S> when the barrier becomes too large , the systems remains in its equilibrium state and the photocurrent vanishes abruptly . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the compressibility measurement , the electron system remains in the incompressible state as @xmath7 changes and the electrostatic barrier does not need to be overcome directly , allowing the incompressible state to exist over a wider parameter range . </S>",
    "<S> ( in the supplementary figures 6 - 9 , we provide a detailed comparison between the two measurement techniques and show that they are fully consistent once the described hysteretic behaviour is taken into account ) .    the estimated charging energy must be provided by the microwave irradiation </S>",
    "<S> since it is the only energy source in our system , its amplitude corresponds to a surprisingly large number of photons absorbed per electron @xmath105 , particularly in comparison with a two level system that can not absorb more than one photon . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the absorbed photons thus needs to be transferred efficiently to other degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it could be transferred by the excitation of higher landau levels . however , the theoretical calculations performed by y. monarkha to explain the origin of microwave induced resistance oscillations for electrons on helium , suggest that landau levels higher than the photon energy are unlikely to be strongly populated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations give an accurate prediction for the phase of the resistance oscillations allowing us to exclude strong inter - landau level excitation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy can also be accumulated by transitions within the same manifold of quasi - degenerate landau levels as they are bent by the confinement potential . </S>",
    "<S> a possible mechanism for this absorption is provided by the negative conductivity models introduced theoretically to explain zrs in heterostructures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that a negative resistance state will stabilize through the formation of domains with a fixed built - in electric field @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> we performed simulations of the electron density profiles for an electric field dependent conductivity model with @xmath107 which is believed to describe domain formation . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations show that this model tends to fix the electron density gradients in order to generate the built in field @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> this changes the compressibility of the electron cloud depending on the number of stable domains in the system but without inducing an incompressible state . </S>",
    "<S> thus , new theoretical developments are required to make the domain picture consistent with our experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> a recent theoretical proposal suggests that another instability can occur even before the conductivity becomes negative @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> due to fluctuations of the microwave electromagnetic field on the wavelength scale @xmath108 ratchet internal currents are expected to appear under irradiation inside the electron system . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of the induced electron flow will scale as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the amplitude of the microwave electric field and @xmath111 a non - linear response coefficient @xcite . under steady state conditions this internal flow </S>",
    "<S> must be compensated by a counter - flow created by internal electric fields with maximal value @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> the balance between the two flows sets a lower bound on the longitudinal mobility that is @xmath113 stable under irradiation : @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> mobilities below this threshold are expected to lead to the formation of electron pockets on a scale @xmath115 with a certain similarly to the stripe / puddles instability occurring in quantum hall systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the above argument predicts the existence of an instability without explaining the pinning of the electron density . </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism selecting a particular density value is thus desirable . as a possible mechanism we propose the following scenario . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that a significant fraction of the energy carried by the absorbed photons is transferred into ripplons with a typical wave number given by the inverse magnetic length @xmath116 @xcite , then the helium surface will vibrate at frequency @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the helium surface tension and density respectively @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> even if the described mechanism requires further theoretical studies , it correctly captures the critical dependence on the electronic density observed in the experiments . for electrons on helium </S>",
    "<S> the electronic density mainly controls the strength of electron - electron interactions and the key role played by this parameter indicates that the formation of incompressible states is a collective effect involving many electrons .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that electrons trapped on a helium surface exhibit incompressible behavior under resonant irradiation conditions corresponding to the formation of a microwave induced zero - resistances state . </S>",
    "<S> their density becomes pinned to a fixed value independent of the applied electrostatic force and on the initial electron distribution profile for a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the incompressible state is achieved by overcoming an impressively high electrostatic energy barrier of up to @xmath127 per electron . </S>",
    "<S> we described the possible energy conversion processes within the electron system that can transform the energy of the absorbed photons into charging energy , and we proposed several competing mechanisms that can render the equilibrium density profile unstable . since the incompressible behavior emerging from our experiments is very elegant , we believe that its understanding will stimulate the emergence of new concepts for self - organization in quantum systems .    _ </S>",

    "<S> the experimental cell was filled with liquid helium until half filling by monitoring the cell capacitance during helium condensation . </S>",
    "<S> electrons were deposited on the helium surface by thermionic - emission from a heated tungsten filament . </S>",
    "<S> control of the total electron number @xmath10 in the cloud was achieved by trapping an initially high concentration of electrons and then lowering the confinement voltages allowing excess electrons to escape . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath10 value was determined from compressibility measurements in equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the intersubband transition was tuned in resonance with the photon energy using the linear starck shift induced by the electric field perpendicular to the helium surface which was fixed during our compressibility and photo - current experiments in order to keep the system at intersubband resonance . </S>",
