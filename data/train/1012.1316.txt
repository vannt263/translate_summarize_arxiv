    "understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) is the primary goal of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) program . within the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics",
    ", ewsb occurs via the higgs mechanism which predicts a weak scale higgs boson @xmath9 which unitarizes longitudinal @xmath8 boson scattering and accommodates electroweak ( ew ) precision data . the current limits on the sm higgs boson mass @xmath10 consist of the lower bound @xmath11 gev from lepii @xcite , and the exclusion window @xmath12 gev from tevatron @xcite",
    ". however , these limits are model dependent .",
    "for instance , in several extensions of the sm with an extended higgs sector , new decay channels for the higgs boson are available and the exclusion bounds are weakened @xcite .",
    "therefore , new strategies to discover non - standard higgs bosons at the lhc and the tevatron need to be developed to be sure all regions of ewsb parameter space are covered .    in this work",
    "we consider the possibility that a light higgs boson is produced in supersymmetric cascades and subsequently decays to four light jets ( i.e without @xmath13 s ) , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a new light pseudoscalar that is neutral under the sm gauge group .",
    "this non - standard higgs boson decay is present in many extensions of the sm that stabilize the ew scale @xcite .",
    "the typical fine - tuning in these models is reduced because the experimental constraints on the higgs sector are much weaker .",
    "indeed , for @xmath15 heavier than @xmath16 gev only the opal model independent bound @xcite , @xmath17 gev , holds .",
    "if @xmath18 gev , the lower bound is slightly stronger @xcite , @xmath19 gev , while recently recasted @xcite aleph data @xcite set @xmath20 gev for @xmath21 gev .",
    "present hadron collider data do not constrain such a higgs boson because of the huge qcd background .",
    "recent studies @xcite have discussed search strategies of a higgs boson decaying to four light jets at the lhc by means of jets substructure techniques @xcite . if the higgs boson has a large boost factor , its decay products will be merged into a single fat jet with characteristic substructure . since qcd jets from background processes",
    "are relatively uncorrelated , substructure requirements can significantly enhance the signal to background .",
    "our analysis extends previous works in three main directions :    * we consider higgs boson production in association with supersymmetric particles which can lead to a much earlier discovery ( similar to the @xmath22 analysis in susy @xcite ) compared to the search using sm - like production .",
    "in particular , we consider neutralino and chargino two body decays , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "* we do not restrict our analysis to very light @xmath15 below the @xmath25 threshold .",
    "we instead extend the @xmath15 mass range , @xmath26  gev . *",
    "we discuss how to reduce the contamination from hadronic @xmath8 and @xmath27 for a low - mass higgs boson .",
    "these are the irreducible backgrounds for supersymmetric higgs productions and can be larger than the signal in the resonance regions .",
    "this requires special treatment because they can easily produce a similar substructure pattern as the higgs boson .",
    "we find that for @xmath28 gev and for a light pseudo - scalar @xmath29 gev , the higgs boson remains hidden in the w background after all cuts are applied . for heavier higgs bosons , where the @xmath8 s are well separated from the higgs boson peak , we obtain @xmath30 signal significance at the lhc with @xmath31 tev and @xmath5  @xmath32 which is smaller by a factor @xmath33 than the luminosity needed for discovery in the sm production channel  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we discuss some illustrative models in which the higgs originates in a supersymmetry cascade and subsequently decays to four light jets . in sec .",
    "[ production ] , we discuss rates of higgs boson production associated with supersymmetric particles .",
    "these supersymmetric events are isolated by means of cuts discussed in sec .",
    "[ susycuts ] . in sec .",
    "[ substructure ] we discuss our analysis , including a refinement of jet substructure algorithms used in our search , and we present the results in section  [ results ] . finally , we conclude in sec .  [ conclusions ] .",
    "cascade decays of the higgs boson to sm states through a pair of light pseudoscalar @xmath15 s are well motivated in several extensions of the sm .",
    "they include supersymmetric @xcite as well as non - supersymmetic @xcite realizations .",
    "after spontaneous ewsb , a trilinear coupling between light sm singlets @xmath15 and the higgs boson @xmath9 is a generic feature : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the typical scale that controls the interaction strength .",
    "for instance , in models where @xmath9 and @xmath15 emerge as pseudo - goldstone bosons and @xmath36 , the derivative interaction @xmath37 produces the lagrangian ( [ h2eta ] ) after integration by parts . in these scenarios",
    "@xmath35 is analogous to the pion decay constant that sets the couplings in the chiral lagrangian .",
    "if @xmath35 is not too large compared to the ew scale and @xmath38 is not too small , the decay width of the higgs boson into two @xmath15 s @xmath39 can easily dominate over the sm channel @xmath22 .",
    "the pseudoscalar @xmath15 is generically unstable because it couples to sm fermions with effective yukawa interactions @xmath40 generated after ewsb , @xmath41 .",
    "then , barring accidental cancellations , the largest yukawa coupling is to the third generation quarks , while all other sm fermion couplings are highly suppressed . for recent studies where @xmath42 see ref .",
    ". however , when @xmath43 gev the decay of @xmath15 to two gluons via loops of third generation quarks will be the dominant decay mode , corresponding to a four unflavored jet final state , @xmath44 .",
    "for instance , this scenario is naturally realized in the supersymmetric `` buried higgs '' model @xcite where both @xmath9 and @xmath15 are pseudo - goldstone bosons arising from a global @xmath45 symmetry broken down to @xmath46 at the scale @xmath47 gev . in this model ,",
    "the coupling between @xmath15 and @xmath9 depends only on a mixing angle @xmath48 which measures the alignment between the gauged @xmath49 and the residual global @xmath46 , @xmath50 .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath53 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "an appealing modification of the buried higgs scenario is the `` charming higgs '' model @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector is the same as in the original buried higgs model but the embedding of the matter content into the @xmath45 global symmetry multiplets is different . in particular ,",
    "the bottom yukawa arises only from non - renormalizable operators suppressed by the physical scale @xmath55 tev where new heavy states are integrated out .",
    "then , the resulting bottom yukawa coupling to @xmath15 is greatly suppressed because it has to vanish both for large @xmath35 and for large @xmath56 , therefore @xmath57 .",
    "thus , it turns out that the dominant decay channel is the tree - level @xmath58 even when @xmath15 is above @xmath25 threshold production , @xmath59 .",
    "the next relevant decay mode , @xmath52 , is generated at 1-loop .",
    "very much like the original buried higgs model , the charming version buries the higgs boson beneath the qcd background at the lhc .",
    "another class of models where the higgs may naturally cascade decay to four jets is provided by the non - minimal composite higgs models @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will use the buried / charming higgs models as illustrative examples of supersymmetric extensions of the sm where the higgs boson cascade decays to four light jets where @xmath60 $ ] gev and @xmath61 $ ] gev . for simplicity and clarity of presentation , in our simulations we consider higgs boson production rates as they appear in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "corrections , these rates are the same as those in the buried and charming higgs models . ] in particular the higgs production from susy events is matched to the production in the mssm with the same input parameters and higgs mass . in our numerical study",
    "we take the branching ratios for @xmath51 and @xmath62 to both be @xmath63 .",
    "in general , there are several possible production channels for the higgs boson in susy in addition to the sm channels .",
    "the important ones are those with large cross sections such as the pair production of gluinos and squarks . in the subsequent cascade decay of these particles ,",
    "a higgs boson can be produced in many different ways , the most important being through supersymmetric gauge interactions from the gaugino - higgsino - higgs coupling .",
    "depending on the mass spectra of charginos and neutralinos , there can be two scenarios : the  little cascade \" and the  big cascade \" .    in the first case , a higgs is produced in the decay @xmath64 .",
    "for this channel to dominate , the @xmath65-term needs to be larger than the gaugino masses to ensure that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are gaugino - like .",
    "if , in addition , the sleptons are heavier than @xmath68 , the decay to higgs is always dominant since the other available mode , @xmath69 depends on the higgsino - higgsino - z coupling which is doubly suppressed by small higgsino mixing .",
    "the @xmath70 can be produced from the decays of @xmath71 or @xmath72 with sizable branching fractions , producing a sizable fraction of susy events which contain higgs bosons .    in the second case ,",
    "the higgs boson is produced in the decay of heavier neutralinos and charginos ( @xmath73/@xmath74 ) into lighter ones ( @xmath66/@xmath67 ) .",
    "to have a large rate from gluino and squark decays , the heavy neutralinos and charginos need to be gaugino - like whereas the light ones higgsino - like .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath65-term which is small in comparison with the gaugino masses , and to weak gauginos which are lighter than squarks and gluinos .",

    "in addition , since gluinos are flavor blind , they can decay to third - generation squarks .",
    "this leads to top quarks being produced in the cascade decay and further contributes to the large multiplicity of w bosons in events in this benchmark model .",
    "benchmark 2 features a very small @xmath65-term , corresponding to a higgs which is produced in the big cascade .",
    "this model is the same as shsp 1a in @xcite . due to large gluino mass",
