    "soft @xmath7-ray repeaters ( sgrs ) are sources of recurrent , short ( @xmath8 ) , intense ( @xmath9 ) bursts of @xmath7-ray emission with an energy spectrum characterized by temperatures of @xmath10 kev .",
    "occasionally sgrs enter into active episodes producing many short x - ray bursts ; extremely rarely ( about once per 50 years per source ) , sgrs emit a giant flare , an event with total energy at least 1000 times higher than their typical bursts . the normal pattern of sgrs is intense activity periods which can last weeks or months , separated by quiescent phases lasting years or decades .",
    "current theory explains this energy release as the result of a catastrophic reconfiguration of a magnetar s magnetic field .",
    "axps are similar in nature but with a somewhat weaker intensity and no recurrent bursting .",
    "several sgrs / axps have been found to be x - ray pulsars with unusually high spin - down rates , usually attributed to magnetic braking caused by their super - strong magnetic field . in all sources with magnetar - like activity",
    ", the dipolar fields span @xmath11 , which is @xmath121000 times the average value in radio pulsars .",
    "magnetar - like activity previously was observed only in sources with dipolar magnetic fields stronger than the electron quantum field , @xmath13 gauss .",
    "was discovered on 5 june 2009 when the fermi gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) observed two magnetar - like bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up observations with several x - ray satellites show that it has x - ray pulsations at @xmath149.1s , well within the range of periods of sgr sources ( @xcite )",
    ". the implied upper limit on the period derivative of  of @xmath15   is by far the smallest of all known sgrs / axps .",
    "the corresponding limit on the surface dipolar magnetic field of is @xmath16gauss , making it the sgr with the lowest surface dipolar magnetic field yet .",
    "the upper limit on the period derivative implies a characteristic age of the source in excess of @xmath17 myr in the standard dipole model , @xmath18 .",
    "despite such a low surface magnetic field ( @xmath19 ) ,  exhibits all the typical characteristics of an sgr .",
    "its bursting properties can be summarized as follows ( @xcite ) :    * at a distance of 2 kpc , assuming that the source is located in the perseus arm , the estimate energies of the two observed bursts ( in the 8 - 200 kev range ) are @xmath20 erg and @xmath21 erg , which is at the lower end of the distribution compared to other sgr bursts but at the high end for axp ones . * an optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung provides the best fit in both bursts ( see table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum softens from @xmath22 kev in the frist burst to @xmath23 kev in the second burst in the time period of @xmath24 minutes which separated the two bursts . * immediately following the burst and for the first 160 days ( before it disappeared behind the sun ) ,   flux declined by an order of magnitude from @xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ( @xmath28 erg s@xmath27 ) to @xmath29 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ( @xmath30 erg s@xmath27 ) .",
    "the corresponding blackbody temperature declined from 1 kev to 0.8 kev ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) . *",
    "the burst luminosity is @xmath31 erg s@xmath27 with burst temperature in the 20 - 30 kev range .",
    "assuming blackbody emission the emitting area can be estimated to be on average @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "s   current properties ( i.e. following the bursting era ) show a spectrum which is well fit by an absorbed blackbody with a line - of - sight absorption @xmath342 and @xmath35kev .",
    "using the current luminosity of @xmath36 erg s@xmath27 , and a blackbody temperature of 0.67 kev ( @xcite ) the emitting area is @xmath37 @xmath33 ( @xmath38 ) indicative of a hot spot on the surface of the star .",
    "since the internal field strength required to produce crustal cracking in the magnetar model should be typically in excess of @xmath39 gauss ( @xcite ) , one wonders how , with its weak surface magnetic field , can harbor a much stronger magnetic field in its crust .",
    "in fact , for such an old source ( @xmath40 myr ) it would take an even stronger internal field to crack the cold crust yr ) if the dissipation scale is much shorter than typical crust scale ( @xmath41 cm ) ( @xcite ) . ] .",
    "could such a difference between the surface and crustal field be possible and sustainable ?",
    "what mechanism could lead to such a gradient , and if it exists does it mean that some ordinary pulsars are dormant sgrs waiting to erupt ?",
    "maybe a strong magnetic field is not necessary to explain sgr behavior .",
    "the existence of radio pulsars with @xmath42 and , so far , showing only normal behavior ( @xcite ) is another clue that magnetic fields larger than the quantum electron field alone may not be a sufficient condition for the onset of magnetar - like activity .    here",
    "we present an alternative model which offers natural answers to these outstanding questions . in our model high magnetic field strength",
    "is not necessary to explain the bursting phase of sgrs and axps : it involves an aligned rotator ( a quark star ; hereafter qs ) and iron - rich debris material in the close vicinity ( @xmath24-@xmath43 km ) of the qs star .",
    "the qs is the compact remnant of the quark - nova ( qn ) explosion , a detonative transition from a neutron star ( ns ) to a qs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the qn detonation also leads to ejection of the ns outer layers ( @xcite ) .",
    "if the qs is born slowly rotating , then the debris formed from the qn ejecta will be in co - rotation with the star s dipole field ( @xcite , herefafter olni ) .",
    "sources born with faster rotation will confine the debris into a keplerian ring at 20 - 100 km away from the star ( @xcite , hereafter olnii ) . in our model sgrs are qs with a co - rotating shell while axps are qs with a keplerian ring .",
    "the debris consists of @xmath44 of iron - rich degenerate material .",
    "the initial qs surface magnetic field is @xmath1 g. such initial extreme surface magnetic fields are natural values for quark stars experiencing color ferromagnetism before they enter the color superconducting phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a summary of our previous works and sets the stage for this work .",
    "section 3 is the application of our model to evolved accreting qs - ring systems .",
    "the thermal feedback between the qs and the ring depends critically on the ring geometry , which evolves from thick to thin . for old sources ,",
    "the resulting behavior is in a different regime than considered in previous papers .",
    "this leads to new forms of the equations , which we then fit to the observations .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "the qs is born an aligned rotator since the superconducting qs confines the interior magnetic field to vortices aligned with the rotation axis ( @xcite ) . as the star spins down via em emission ,",
    "vortices ( and their confined magnetic filed ) are expelled , leading to magnetic field reconnection at the surface of the star .",
    "the period and magnetic field during spin - down evolve as ( @xcite ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 with birth period and magnetic field in millisecond and @xmath1 g , respectively .",
    "the period derivative is @xmath48 with @xmath49 and characteristic age @xmath50 different from @xmath51 in the standard dipole model because vortex expulsion changes the magnetic braking index from @xmath52 ( the theoretical value for an aligned spinning dipole ) to @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath54 myr for .",
    "after 16 myr of spin - down , the initial magnetic field @xmath55 g will be reduced to @xmath56 g.    vortex expulsion leads to an x - ray luminosity given by @xmath57 where the subscript  @xmath58 \" stands for vortex and @xmath59 is an efficiency parameter ( see olni and @xcite ) ; @xmath60 is in units of @xmath61 s s@xmath27 .",

    "qs - ring systems ( axps ) enter an accretion era where their steady x - ray luminosity is dominated by accretion ( olnii ) .",
    "these systems will evolve along the accretion band ( see figure [ fig : illustration ] ) , and return to the vortex band ( a vortex - dominated phase ) much later once the ring is consumed ( @xcite , hereafter olniii ) . in olniii rrats",
    "are explained as the result of axps descending back to the vortex band .",
    "the qs - ring system for axps allows us to differentiate between axps and transient axps .",
    "transients axps are qs - ring systems which have not yet entered the accretion - dominated phase and are in the vortex band ( @xcite , hereafter olniv ) .",
    "transient axps burst only when the inner wall of the ring is permeated by the magnetic field and is accreted . only during bursting phase",
    "does the ring accrete ( olniv ) . during quiescence , these are much quieter than sgrs ( although in similar region in the vortex band ) since the ring is more stable than the co - rotating shell ( olni&olnii ) .    all of qs - ring systems should eventually enter an accretion - dominated phase .",
    "the onset of accretion is dictated by an interplay between the magnetic field and the ring / atmosphere : the highly conducting degenerate ring is not penetrated by the magnetic field . in olniv",
    "a  squashed \" field was necessary to explain some aspects of transient axps , while in olnii a  stretched \" configuration ( shown in figure [ fig : illustration ] here ) was appropriate .",
    "this suggests one evolves into the other as a consequence of ring viscous spreading and magnetic field decay .",
    "the bursting properties of sgrs and axps are caused by the interaction between the qn debris material and the star s magnetic field .",
    "this leads to accretion of debris onto the qs .",
    "the fundamental difference between the co - rotating shell ( sgrs ) and the keplerian ring ( axps ) is stability .",
    "the co - rotating shell is a very unstable configuration with the shell s boundary hovering around the magnetic neutrality line prompting more instabilities ( and thus more recurrent bursts ) .",
    "the keplerian ring is more stable and is only perturbed after magnetic field penetration of its inner edge , which triggers the accretion of a small inner part of the ring ( i.e. the wall ) .",
    "high magnetic field strength is not a requirement in our model : wall penetration can occur even in old sources .",
    "below , the quiescent and bursting properties of   are explained in the context of an old evolved accreting qs - ring system .",
    "qs - shell systems ( sgrs ) and non - accreting qs - ring systems ( transient axps ) in quiescence consist of two emitting components ( qs vortex annihilation and shell / ring reprocessing the qs flux ) .",
    "accreting qs - ring systems ( axps ) , during quiescence , have three components : the accreting hot spot , the qs vortex annihilation and the illuminated ring .",
    "all types of systems would burst when chunks of the shell / ring are accreted onto the star . only during the bursting phase",
    "would transient axps resemble axps ( olniv ) .",
