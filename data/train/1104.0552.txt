    "<S> transport properties are discussed in terms of time - dependent scattering theory . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the superconducting gap is small on the energy scales set by the fermi energy and the ferromagnetic exchange splitting , and compute the non - equilibrium charge and spin current response to first order in precession frequency , in the presence of a finite applied voltage . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the voltage - induced instantaneous charge current and longitudinal spin current are unaffected by the precessing magnetization , while the pumped transverse spin current is determined by spin - dependent conductances and details of the electron - hole scattering matrix . </S>",
    "<S> a simplified expression for the transverse spin current is derived for structures where the ferromagnet is longer than the transverse spin coherence length . </S>"
