    "local _ , as in _ locally uncomplicated _ , we sometimes refer to locations in the source @xmath0 , sometimes to locations in the target @xmath2 .",
    "the emphasis is on families of smooth maps ; this is in contrast to morse theory , where the study of individual ( locally uncomplicated ) smooth maps from a manifold to @xmath3 is a central topic .",
    "we are guided by two observations .",
    "\\(i ) let @xmath4 be an open subspace of the space of all smooth maps @xmath5 defined by prohibiting certain singularities .",
    "it is a special case of a theorem due to vassiliev @xcite,@xcite that @xmath4 has an accessible homotopy type or homology type if , loosely speaking , every smooth map @xmath5 can be approximated by a map which belongs to @xmath4 , and moreover every smooth one - parameter family of smooth maps @xmath5 can be approximated by a path in @xmath4 .",
    "therefore we are inclined to define notions of locally uncomplicated map @xmath5 by prohibiting certain singularities or singularity types corresponding to a subset of an appropriate jet space whose codimension in the jet space is at least @xmath6 .",
    "\\(ii ) more restrictive notions of locally uncomplicated map @xmath5 can be obtained by prohibiting , for every @xmath7 , certain configurations of @xmath8 singularities ( _ multigerms _ ) in the source @xmath0 , with the same image point in @xmath2 . the vassiliev theorem mentioned above",
    "can be adapted to this setup @xcite , although it is considerably harder to say which multigerms can be prohibited without making the resulting space of locally uncomplicated smooth maps @xmath5 homologically or homotopically inaccessible .",
    "these two observations raise two elementary classification problems , one for uncomplicated germs and one for uncomplicated multigerms .",
    "the solution of the first problem is well known , but we review it . in the second problem , it is not straightforward to come up with a manageable interpretation of _",
    "we propose one and describe our solution .",
    "the classification of the most common map germs from plane to plane up to left - right equivalence is well known .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "( we are talking about smooth map germs @xmath9 from @xmath10 to @xmath10 .",

    "we will repeat it here nevertheless and see some normal forms and tell the story of each singularity type .",
    "there are six types that we consider worthy of attention : _ regular _ , _ fold _ , _ cusp _ , _ swallowtail _ , _ lips _ and _ beak - to - beak_. the regular ( alias nonsingular ) type is well understood .",
    "the remaining five types are of rank 1 , that is , the derivative at the origin has rank 1 .",
    "( the cases where the derivative has rank 0 are uninteresting to us because their codimension is at least 4 . ) among these , it is natural to distinguish between those for which the 1-jet prolongation is transverse to the rank 1 stratum ( fold , cusp and swallowtail ) and those for which it is not ( lips and beak - to - beak ) . in the transverse case , the singularity set in the source is a smooth curve in the plane , passing through the origin ; in the non - transverse case , it is in some way or other a singular curve , as we will see .",
    "_ fold _ : the normal form is @xmath16 .",
    "the singularity set in the source is a line ( in the normal form , the @xmath17-axis ) and the singularity set in the target is also a line ( in the normal form , again the @xmath17-axis ) .",
    "the intrinsic second derivative @xcite at the origin is a nondegenerate quadratic form ( defined on the kernel of the first derivative , and with values in the cokernel of the first derivative ) .",
    "_ cusp _ : normal form @xmath18 .",
    "the derivative matrix for the normal form is @xmath19 with determinant @xmath20 . hence the singularity set @xmath21 in the source is the trajectory of @xmath22 , a parabola .",
    "the singularity set in the target is the trajectory of @xmath23 .",
    "_ swallowtail _ : normal form @xmath24 .",
    "the singularity set @xmath21 in the source is the trajectory of @xmath25 .",

    "it is a manifold but it does not have dimension 1 .    _ beak - to - beak _ : normal form @xmath29 .",
    "the singularity set in the source is the set of zeros of the quadratic form @xmath30 , that is , the union of the lines described by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "it has dimension 1 but it is not a manifold .",
    "the singularity set in the target is the union of the trajectories of @xmath34    in all these formulae , the first coordinate @xmath12 of @xmath9 is @xmath35 .",
    "the best way to understand the classification is to regard the second coordinate @xmath36 of @xmath9 as an _ unfolding _ of a germ @xmath37 , with unfolding parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the formula for @xmath38 can be seen by setting @xmath39 .",
    "this gives @xmath40 for the regular case , @xmath41 for the fold , @xmath42 for cusp , lips and beak - to - beak , and @xmath43 for the swallowtail .",
    "which sometimes clash with our names for the corresponding maps @xmath9 .",

    "each of the unfoldings can be pulled back from a miniversal unfolding with parameter space @xmath44 .",
    "the miniversal unfoldings are as follows : @xmath45 this is essentially in the notation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.15 ) , although we use @xmath46 where @xcite has @xmath17 .",
    "the decisive features of the germs @xmath9 are therefore as follows :    * the corresponding germ @xmath37 obtained by setting @xmath39 in the formula for @xmath36  ; * the smooth map @xmath47 ( where @xmath44 parametrizes the miniversal unfolding of the appropriate @xmath38 ) such that @xmath36 as an unfolding is isomorphic to @xmath48 of the miniversal unfolding .",

    "@xmath50 or @xmath51 . in the notation of (",
    "* ch.15 ) , the maps @xmath49 are as follows : @xmath52 for the cusp , @xmath53 for the swallowtail , @xmath54 for the lips and @xmath55 for beak - to - beak .",
    "it is not completely trivial to justify this classification .",
    "what the above arguments prove beyond doubt is that we have a _ surjective _ map from isomorphism classes of 1-parameter unfoldings of germs @xmath38 ( such as @xmath56 , with @xmath57 ) to the set of left - right equivalence classes of germs @xmath58 whose derivative at @xmath59 has rank 1 . what remains to be done",
    "is roughly the following :    * to produce a `` sufficiently big '' list of some of the @xmath60-parameter unfoldings of the germs @xmath38 , and to determine the corresponding left - right equivalence classes of map germs @xmath61  ; * to show that each of these left - right equivalence classes has codimension @xmath62 and that all remaining germs @xmath63 taken together make up a subset of codimension @xmath64 .",
    "we start with the list of unfoldings .",
    "every 1-parameter unfolding of a smooth function germ @xmath65 with nonzero taylor series is isomorphic to @xmath48 of the miniversal unfolding , where @xmath66 is smooth and @xmath67 is the parameter space for the miniversal unfolding of @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that @xmath49 is usually not unique makes the classification difficult . however , some special cases are easy .    if @xmath41 , then @xmath68 is zero - dimensional .    if @xmath42 , then @xmath68 is 1-dimensional .",
    "the proposed normal forms for @xmath49 are @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath72 has nonzero first derivative , then we can find an invertible @xmath73 such that @xmath74 where @xmath69 , and that can be used to produce the required isomorphism .",
    "similarly , if @xmath75 has zero first derivative but strictly positive second derivative , then we can find an invertible @xmath73 such that @xmath74 where @xmath70 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath75 has zero first derivative but strictly negative second derivative , then we can find an invertible germ @xmath73 such that @xmath74 where @xmath71 .",
    "so in fact the only difficult case is the case where @xmath43 .",
    "we use the miniversal unfolding given by  ( [ 2.7.09:2 ] )",
    ". hence @xmath67 is 2-dimensional .",
    "we want to focus on map germs @xmath47 with nonzero first derivative , not parallel to the @xmath76-axis .",
    "( the @xmath76-axis is a distinguished direction in @xmath44 because it is parallel to the cusp in @xmath44 obtained by projecting the fiberwise singularity set of the unfolding to @xmath44 . )",
    "the corresponding 1-parameter unfolding of @xmath43 then has the form @xmath77 with @xmath78 . using @xmath79 to transform the source of @xmath49",
    ", we can reduce to a situation where @xmath80 .",
    "so we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 . from example",
    "[ expl - unfoldswallowtail ] we know that this is left - right equivalent to @xmath83 , which is the swallowtail normal form .    the rest of our classification task is easier .",
    "the five singularity types , represented by the five normal forms above , are easy to distinguish by geometric properties which are invariant under left - right equivalence .",
    "for the fold type , the singularity set @xmath21 in the source is a smooth submanifold of dimension 1 , and @xmath84 is an immersion ( near 0 ) .",
    "for the cusp and swallowtail , the singularity set @xmath21 in the source is still a smooth submanifold of dimension 1 , but @xmath84 is not an immersion near @xmath59 . to distinguish cusp and swallowtail ,",
    "it is enough to show that the curves @xmath85 are not left - right equivalent .",
    "this is obvious by looking at the second ( intrinsic ) derivative  @xcite at the origin , which is nonzero in the cusp case , zero in the swallowtail case .    for the lips and beak - to - beak ,",
    "the singularity set in the source is not a smooth submanifold of dimension 1 ; it is a point in the lips case and a `` node '' ( two crossing lines ) in the beaks - to - beaks case .",
    "we turn to the codimension and stratification analysis . among other things",
    "we want to determine the codimension of each of the six types described above , and we want to show that all remaining singularity types taken together constitute a set of codimension @xmath86 .",
    "we start by summarizing the analytic characterizations of the six types .",
    "we can always assume that @xmath58 has the form @xmath87 and @xmath88 vanishes at @xmath59 .",
    "in the singular case , we also assume that @xmath89 vanishes at @xmath59 .",
    "the following table describes the six types by means of conditions on the 4th taylor polynomial of @xmath36 .",
    "the conditions typically state that some term in the taylor polynomial has to be zero ( z ) or nonzero ( n ) .",
    "for example , the table states that in the case of a cusp , the coefficients of @xmath46 and @xmath90 must be zero while the coefficients of @xmath91 and @xmath92 must be nonzero ( and there are no further conditions ) . in the `` other conditions '' column of the table , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95",

    "we now wish to show that @xmath114 is open , to determine the codimensions in @xmath114 of the six orbits , and show that the complement of @xmath114 has codimension @xmath120 in @xmath102 .",
    "we have already convinced ourselves that every @xmath121 is left - right equivalent to some @xmath122 .",
    "in other words , the restricted action map @xmath123 is onto .",
