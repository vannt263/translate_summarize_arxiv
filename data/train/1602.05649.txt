    "specific interactions between many species of components is the bedrock of biochemical function , allowing signal transduction along complex parallel pathways and self - assembly of multi - component molecular machines .",
    "inspired by their role in biology , engineered specific interactions have opened up tremendous opportunities in materials synthesis , achieving new morphologies of self - assembled structures with varied and designed functionality .",
    "the two major design approaches for programming specific interactions either use chemical specificity or shape complementarity .    _ chemical specificity _ is achieved by dividing binding sites into smaller regions , each of which can be given one of @xmath0 `` colors '' , or unique chemical identities .",
    "sites bind to each other based on the sum of the interactions between corresponding regions .",
    "for example , a recent two color system paints the flat surfaces of 3-dimensional polyhedra with hydrophobic and hydrophilic patterns @xcite , or with a pattern of solder dots @xcite , allowing polyhedra to stick to each other based on the registry between their surface patterns . another popular approach uses dna hybridization , where specific matching of complementary sequences has been used to self - assemble structures purely from dna strands @xcite , and from nanoparticles coated with carefully chosen dna strands @xcite .",

    "recent experiments have explored the range of possibilities opened up by such ideas , from lithographically designed planar particles @xcite with undulating profile patterns to `` pac - man '' particles with cavities that exactly match smaller complementary particles @xcite .",
    "the number of possible shapes that can be made using these types of methods depends on fabrication constraints but the possibilities can be quite rich @xcite . using only non - specific surface attraction ,",
    "experiments have achieved numerous and complex morphologies such as clusters , crystals , glasses , and superlattices @xcite .",
    "a further class of programmable specific interactions combines both chemical specificity and shape complementarity .",
    "the canonical example is protein binding interactions @xcite ; the binding interactions between two cognate proteins are specified by their amino acid sequence , which programs binding pockets with complex shape and chemical specificity .",
    "recent efforts @xcite aim to rationally design these protein interactions for self - assembly . since both the shape of the binding pocket and its chemical specificity is determined by the same amino acid sequence , these two features can not be controlled independently .",
    "other synthetic systems offer the promise of independent control of chemical and shape binding specificity , giving a larger set of possible interactions .",
    "these diverse systems achieve specific interactions through disparate physical mechanisms , with different control parameters for tuning binding specificity .",
    "however , they must all solve a common problem@xcite : create a family of @xmath1 `` lock '' and `` key '' pairs that bind well within pairs but avoid off - target binding across pairs ( ` crosstalk ' ) .",
    "any crosstalk limits the efficacy of the locks and keys .",
    "for example , in the context of dna - based affinities , although there are @xmath2 unique sequences of length @xmath3 , the strong off - target binding severely restricts the number that can be productively used .",
    "analogously , for colloidal systems driven by depletion interactions , there can be significant off - target binding due to partial contact .",
    "the performance of a system of specific interactions depends acutely on how the system constraints ( e.g. number of available bases , fabrication length scale , etc . ) limit its ability to avoid crosstalk .    in this paper",

    "we use a metric based on mutual information to derive a bound on the number of different interacting particles that a system can support before crosstalk overwhelms interaction specificity . increasing",

    "we assume a distance dependence of the color interaction , with length scale @xmath168 , such that the energy of interaction decays as @xmath169 for two surfaces separated at a distance @xmath170 .",

    ", crosstalk arises from accidental matches in _ either _ independent channel ; hence the crosstalk is simply the sum of the number of matching sites in the two channels .",
    "however , in the @xmath171 model , crosstalk in the color channel can arise at a site only when there is an accidental match in _ both _ color and shape channels at that site .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapeandcolor]a , all three matching color sites contribute to crosstalk in the @xmath160 model .",
    "however , in the @xmath171 model , these three sites are not accidentally matched in the shape channel ; since the three color sites are not in contact , they do not contribute to crosstalk . as a result ,",
    "off - target binding is generally weaker and the typical gap @xmath172 higher in the @xmath171 model , as we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : shapeandcolor]b . thus the mixing of shape and color in this interactive manner increases the capacity .",
    "we may further examine how the capacity changes as a function of @xmath168 , the interaction range of the color system .",
    "when @xmath168 is small compared to @xmath75 , the maximum height of local shape features , shape features can be easily distinguished by the color force and so the color and shape work in concert to increase capacity .",
    "increasing @xmath168 blurs the shape contours and the color interactions no longer distinguish shapes , thereby becoming less specific . indeed , fig [ fig : shapeandcolor]c shows that when @xmath173 becomes large , the color system and the shape system act independently , and the capacity relaxes to the capacity of the linked system shape @xmath160 color .    in summary , laying out color - based codes on undulating surfaces significantly reduces the total crosstalk since color - matched sites",

    "here we have shown that mutual information provides a general metric for specificity , bounding the number of distinct lock - key pairs that can be supported by systems of programmable specific affinities .",
    "mutual information is well suited as a measure of specificity for many reasons .",
    "first , mutual information is a global measure of specificity , accounting for all possible interactions between @xmath1 species of locks and keys .",
    "second , as a result , it provides a precise answer as to how many particle pairs can be productively used in a given system . as @xmath1 is increased , crosstalk necessarily increases as we crowd the space of possible components ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1_guf]b,@xcite ) with more and more lock - key pairs",
    ". capacity is determined by the point @xmath179 at which the information gain due to larger @xmath1 is negated by the increase in crosstalk .",
    "third , we can use mutual information to quantitatively compare disparate types of programmable interactions , from dna hybridization to depletion driven interactions .",
    "our framework can also quantitatively predict how varying physical parameters ( e.g. , depletion particle size , range of interactions , elastic modulus of shapes ) raises or lowers specificity .",
    "the models we discuss can be further refined in various ways , for example by allowing dna strands to fold , examining shapes in three dimensions , or taking into account the entropic effects of multivalency and avidity @xcite .",
    "using such an approach , we found that ( 1 ) shape complementarity intrinsically suffers less crosstalk than ` color ' ( i.e. , chemical specificity)-based interactions and ( 2 ) multiple physical interactions , such as color - based and shape - based interactions , can be combined in a synergistic manner , giving a capacity that is greater than the sum of the parts .",
    "such predictions are especially valuable , given the proliferation of different mechanisms for creating and combining distinct mechanisms of specificity : mutual information provides an unbiased way of comparing their efficacy to each other . as programmable specificity continues to drive technological developments in self - assembly @xcite , understanding how the mutual information of paired components can be built up towards creating larger ,",
    "multi - component objects is a critical future direction of this work .    while we focus on applications to colloidal systems",
    ", we note that the framework developed here can be employed to study biological systems as well . in 1890 , emil fischer proposed the ` lock and key ' model as an analogy for understanding enzyme - substrate specificity @xcite , focusing on the physical shapes of paired interacting components ; mutual information encompasses this idea and can be applicable to a large number of biological systems .",
    "in particular , our model is useful for predicting the differences between interacting proteins that use shape complementarity alone and those that combine both shape and electrostatic complementarity ( e.g. dpr - dip vs dscam proteins @xcite ) , and may also be applied to a host of other biological interaction networks @xcite where information transmission and pair specificity play critical roles in biological function ( e.g. hkrr proteins @xcite and the immune system @xcite ) .",
    "crucially , the mutual information model provided above is flexible enough to be extended to some of the challenging physics encountered in biology .",
    "nonequilibrium systems can be accounted for by computing time dependent probabilities of interactions instead of the equilibrium probabilities , while hypotheses for increased specificity like ` induced fit ' and recent variants @xcite can be tested directly for their impact on capacity .    in this work",
    ", we have shown that mutual information is a powerful tool to describe diverse specificity models .",
    "the strength of our framework is that it is broadly applicable - it may immediately be applied to any system for which the pairwise energies of interactions are known , in both biology and in synthetic experiments .",
    "we believe that using the capacity as a measure of system specificity will provide a simple metric for analyzing , comparing , and optimizing systems of programmable interactions .",
