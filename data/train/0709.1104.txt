    "massive galactic spheroids form either by hierarchical build  up or monolithically .",
    "the former scenario is favoured by the theory of , and evidence for , cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the latter by _ some _ observations , most notably the evidence for down  sizing in stellar mass and on chemical evolution time  scales from the @xmath3 $ ] enhancement at high spheroid masses ( ) .",
    "the conventional view of hierarchical build  up fits in with semi ",
    "analytical galaxy formation simulations provided that suitable feedback models are prescribed ( , ) .",
    "gas cooling drives star formation below a critical halo mass and agn quenching of star formation occurs at higher masses where the cooling is inefficient .",
    "this model reproduces the shape of the galaxy luminosity function at the high mass end , and also produces old , red massive galaxies . not yet addressed in these studies is the issue of whether these massive galaxies can be formed sufficiently rapidly , the resolution of which may lend support to a monolithic formation scenario .",
    "major mergers are a plausible ingredient of a monolithic model , for triggering rapid star formation .",
    "not all studies agree on the role of major mergers .",
    "not all luminous starbursts are triggered by such mergers .",
    "indeed , in the case of disk galaxy formation , their role is likely to be small .",
    "there is evidence that major mergers are not exclusively responsible for the dominant star formation episodes in starbursts forming stars at up to 200 m@xmath4/yr where thick disks are seen ( e.g. ) .",
    "such high star formation rates , also found in disks at @xmath5 by , may favour an interpretation in terms of bulge formation since the disks are already present .",
    "the observed major merger rate is small out to @xmath6 despite the strong increase in the comoving star formation rate @xcite .",
    "of course , ulirgs , with star formation rates of @xmath7/yr , are examples of major merger  induced star formation . however , for the bulk of star formation in the early universe , there is little evidence to suggest that major mergers play a significant role .",
    "this motivates a hierarchical picture of prolonged minor mergers to build up mass .",
    "one can ask more generally whether minor mergers or gas cloud accretion are responsible for the gas supply .",
    "with regard to minor mergers , the answer seems to be negative , because the time ",
    "scale for supplying the gas would be many dynamical time  scales .",
    "yet there are two persuasive arguments for a short star formation time ",
    "scale in massive galaxies .",
    "sed modelling suggests down  sizing , the most massive galaxies forming first and with star formation time  scales of order a dynamical time . the @xmath8 $ ] enhancement with increasing spheroid mass independently reinforces this conclusion , since most of the star formation must have occurred before dilution of the star ",
    "forming gas by supernovae type ia ejecta occurred .",
    "this result is not , or at least not yet , found in semi ",
    "analytical modelling of massive galaxy formation .",
    "it provides a strong argument for monolithic formation of massive galaxies , although one can not of course exclude the possibility that hierarchical formation models will reproduce a similar result once more complex star formation rules are introduced .",
    "indeed , simple spherically symmetric accretion models have been proposed ( cf . ) that allow the gas to accumulate in an isothermal halo atmosphere prior to an accretion  triggered burst of star formation .",
    "in essence , this approach introduces a monolothic formation model in combination with hierarchical gas accumulation .",
    "unfortunately there is little evidence today for such gas  rich halos , suggesting that this process , if important , would only have been influential at very early epochs .",
    "to save hierarchical models , one needs an efficient way of converting gas into stars .",
    "the typical gas  to  star e  folding time in nearby well  studied sites of star formation , namely spiral galaxies , is several gyr .",
    "by contrast , at a redshift of @xmath9 , the star formation time ",
    "scale is as short as 0.2 gyr from both spectrophotometric sed filling @xcite and @xmath10 $ ] analyses @xcite .",
    "the agn phenomenon is invoked for stopping star formation by quenching the gas supply .",
    "this may keep massive galaxies red , but may not be enough to produce massive galaxies sufficiently early .",
    "one resolution may be to invoke positive feedback from agn  driven outflows that overpressure protogalactic clouds and trigger star formation on a rapid time ",
    "scale @xcite . whether or not this particular solution turns out to resolve the dilemma ( if indeed the problem persists in the perspective of improved star formation modelling ) is not the issue we focus on in this paper .",
    "rather we revisit the case for hierarchical versus monolithic galaxy formation in terms of accounting for the data on star formation rate and chemical evolution .",
    "in this paper we apply a novel statistical approach that rigorously treats the key parameters in semi  analytical galaxy formation theory , with emphasis on reproducing the cosmic star formation and chemical evolution histories .",
    "numerical modelling via semi  analytical techniques of a large box of the universe takes up so much computer time and memory that it is impossible to test the robustness of the results . here",
    "we focus on probing the key parameter space by means of analytical techniques combined with appropriate binning of the full data sets .",
    "we find that the characteristic minimum mass for the building blocks of massive galaxies plays a central role .",
    "specifically , the dust correction scheme one chooses to adopt for the cosmic star formation history data is one of the most critical factors in determining the balance of evidence in support of a hierarchical star formation model as opposed to a monolithic scenario , where star formation happens predominantly in massive spheroids .",
    "our results indicate that the hierarchical star formation model can achieve better agreement with the data , but that this requires a high efficiency of supernova  driven outflows . in a monolithic model ,",
    "our analysis points to the need for a mechanism that drives metal ",
    "poor winds , perhaps in the form of supermassive black hole  induced outflows .",
    "while the monolithic scenario is less favoured in terms of its quality  of  fit , it can not yet be excluded .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : our star formation model is introduced in section  [ sec : model ] , and the dependence of the observable quantities on the free parameters of the model explored in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "we then describe the data employed and our statistical procedure in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] and our conclusions discussed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "appendix  [ app ] gives details of our binning procedure for star formation rate and metallicity data which accounts for undetected systematics .",
    "in this section we present a physical model of the cosmic star formation incorporating supernova feedback , gas accretion and enriched outflows .",
    "our model builds upon the model described in , and more specifically their `` model  0 '' .",
    "the main difference at the model level is our choice of using a different chemical evolution model .",
    "in fact , we adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation whereas in the metallicity is computed under the delayed enrichment approximation .",
    "there are several differences in terms of the statistical treatment of the data and the fitting procedure , that in this work are significantly more sophisticated , as explained in section  [ sec : data ] and appendix  [ app ] .      the description of baryons in the universe and the processes that define the evolution of the baryonic mass are of fundamental importance for our model .",
    "following , we employ three baryon reservoirs in the model , encompassing the interstellar medium ( gas ) , the mass in stars and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the mass of gas , by @xmath12 the mass in stars and by @xmath13 the total mass in collapsed structures .",
    "the igm and the structures exchange mass through accretion and outflow , while the interaction between stars and gas is governed by star formation and ejection of enriched gas . in the instantaneous recycling approximation adopted here ,",
    "the accretion rate of the mass in stars is simply equal to the star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath15 we then have the following set of differential equations governing the evolution of the mass in the three reservoirs : @xmath16 in the above equations , @xmath17 is the rate of baryon accretion while @xmath18 is the rate of baryon outflow .",
    "the latter includes two terms , accounting for winds powered by stellar explosions and supernova ejecta .",
    "we neglect supernova ejecta since this effect was found to be subdominant  @xcite . the relation between physical time @xmath19 and redshift @xmath20",
    "is given by @xmath21 where we have assumed a flat universe . in the following , we will use eq .   with parameters fixed to the values of the @xmath22cdm concordance model , i.e. a matter density parameter @xmath23 and a cosmological constant energy density @xmath24 ( both in units of the critical energy density of the universe ) , and we will take for the hubble constant @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt the hierarchical scenario of structure formation , where small structures are formed first . at redshift @xmath20 ,",
    "the comoving density of dark matter halos in the mass range @xmath26 $ ] is @xmath27 , normalized in such a way that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the comoving dark matter density .",
    "the distribution function of halos @xmath30 is computed using the method described in using code provided by a.  jenkins .",
    "it follows the standard theory @xcite including the modification of .",
    "we assume a primordial power spectrum of fluctuation with a power law index @xmath31 and the fitting formula to the exact transfer function for non - baryonic cold dark matter given by .",
    "for the rms amplitude we adopt a value @xmath32 for mass density fluctuations in a sphere of radius @xmath33mpc .    using the above expressions for the distribution function of dark matter halos",
    ", we can calculate the fraction of baryons at redshift @xmath20 that is allocated to structures , by assuming that the baryon density is proportional to the dark matter density , with a proportionality factor given by the ratio of visible to dark matter density  in other words , we assume that light traces matter with no bias . the fraction of baryons in star  forming structures at redshift @xmath20 is then given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a free parameter controlling the minimum mass ( in units of solar masses ) of the collapsed structures where star formation can occur .",
    "the accretion rate is then given by @xcite : @xmath36 given a value of @xmath35 ( that we adopt as a free parameter , see below ) , we fix the redshift at which star formation begins , @xmath37 by the requirement that @xmath38 .",
    "in other words , the first stars form in collapsed haloes of mass larger than @xmath35 when the fraction of baryons allocated to such structures is more than @xmath39 . we adopt a fixed baryonic density parameter of @xmath40 ( from the posterior mean of wmap 3years data combined with all other datasets , ) .",
    "the adopted stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is of the form @xmath41 where the normalization constant @xmath42 is fixed by the requirement that @xmath43 for the limits of integration we fix @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "therefore the only parameter needed to define the imf is its power  law index , @xmath46 . the quantity @xmath46 is used as a free parameter in this model .",
    "we model the outflow powered by stellar explosions as follows : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the imf defined above , @xmath50 is the lifetime of a star of mass @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the mass of stars that die at age @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath53 is the kinetic energy released by the explosion of a star of mass @xmath51 , that we take to be a fixed constant independent of mass , @xmath54 ergs ( a mass  dependence could easily be taken into account ) .",
    "the free parameter @xmath55 controls the fraction of the kinetic energy of supernovae that is available to power the winds , and @xmath56 is the mean square of the escape velocity of structures at redshift @xmath20 .    in order to compute the stellar lifetime",
    "@xmath57 we assume it to be equal to the time that a star of mass @xmath51 spends on the main sequence .",
    "so the age of a star of mass @xmath51 is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total time that a star of mass @xmath60 will spend on the main sequence and we adopt a value @xmath61  gyr .",
    "to compute @xmath52 in eq .",
    "we solve eq .   for @xmath51 , thereby obtaining the mass of stars @xmath52 that die at age @xmath19 .",
    "the escape velocity is obtained by assuming virialized halos and averaging over the distribution function , thus obtaining to infinity , not the escape velocity from the sites of star formation that are deeper in the potential well .",
    "this approximation does not affect the results for the massive spheroids since even the shallower potential at @xmath62 is deep enough to prevent winds from being effective , see the discussion in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "for less massive systems we expect this approximation to result in slightly smaller values for the parameter @xmath63 than one would otherwise obtain . ] : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the radius of a dark matter halo of mass @xmath66 given by the following expression : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the critical density of the universe today.the factor @xmath69 is the overdensity ( relative to the critical density ) at virialization for an einstein  de sitter model  @xcite .",
    "following , we adopt an exponentially decreasing sfr : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the time corresponding to the redshift @xmath37 when star formation starts ( as defined above ) , @xmath72 is a characteristic time scale that we take as a free parameter and @xmath73 is a normalization parameter ( with dimensions of inverse time ) .",
    "the supernova rate ( snr ) is strongly linked to the star formation rate because of the short lifetime of massive progenitors with @xmath74 .",
    "we can therefore assume that core collapse supernovae ( sne ) are strongly correlated with instantaneous sfr , and the supernovae type ii rate @xmath75 is given by @xmath76      chemical evolution is included in the model using the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "i.e. we assume that all processes involving stellar evolution , nucleosynthesis and recycling take place instantaneously on the timescale of galactic evolution .",
    "the equation of galactic chemical evolution is @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the density of the gas  ( in units of @xmath79 ) , @xmath80 is a multiple of the nucleosynthetic yield that parameterises the metallicity @xmath81 of the sn ejecta  @xcite ( also called `` the load factor '' , adopted here as a free parameter ) and @xmath82 is the yield .",
    "we fix the value of the yield to @xmath83 and assume that the mass accreted to the disk has zero metallicity , i.e. we fix @xmath84 ) .",
    "furthermore , we normalise the metallicities to the solar value for which we adopt @xmath85 .",
    "the chemical evolution of the ism , described by eq .",
    "contains three terms .",
    "the first one represents the chemical enrichment due to the evolution of stars .",
    "the second term represents the dilution of metallicity ( if @xmath86 ) or the chemical enrichment ( if @xmath87 ) of the ism due to accreted material .",
    "the last term describes the dilution of metallicity ( if @xmath88 ) or the chemical enrichment ( if @xmath89 ) of the ism due to galactic winds powered by stellar explosions .    in recent theoretical work , what has been dubbed `` the missing metals problem '' has received considerable attention ( see for an extensive discussion of this problem ) , namely the fact that the mean metallicity is @xmath90 times lower than the value expected from the inferred star formation history .",
    "this problem may indicate a serious flaw in our understanding of the interplay between star formation and metal enrichment .",
    "therefore , we have introduced in our chemical evolution model an extra parameter @xmath91 accounting phenomenologically for these effects .",

    "in this section , we discuss the impact of each of the 7 free parameters in our model ( given in eq .   and in the upper part of table  [ tab : params ] ) on the physical observables introduced above , namely the sfr , sn type ii rate , metallicity and baryonic fraction in structures .",
    "we also present a physical interpretation of the observed behaviour of these quantities . as a fiducial model we fix the parameter values to the following values : @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",

    "smaller values of this parameter describe a scenario where star formation is hierarchical and follows the growth of structures , while higher values of @xmath95 correspond to star formation occurring in massive spheroids .",

    "this effect is more important for the shallower gravitational potential of the low mass halos , i.e. for smaller @xmath95 ( in this example , @xmath134 ) . as already remarked above , higher values of @xmath63 corresponds to winds sweeping out metals from the ism and thus to lower metallicity ( bottom panel ) .",

    "the peak in the probability distribution for @xmath63 observed in figure  [ fig:1d ] is therefore mostly a consequence of a volume effect of our bayesian mcmc scanning technique .",
    "the star formation timescale @xmath158 gyr is in good agreement with theoretical models for milky way size disk galaxies ( with virial mass @xmath159 close to our best fit value for @xmath95 ) .",
    "the imf index is tilted towards extreme values , thus reducing the sn rates but boosting the sfr ( compare figure  [ fig : sen_x ] ) .",
    "this in turns increases the metallicity , and a large dilution factor , @xmath160 , is required to bring the predictions in line with observations .",
    "we notice that this agrees within a factor of two with the value already found in previous works on the metallicity of sn ejecta , which was of order 10 .",
    "however , the extremely steep imf that this model prefers ( @xmath161 ) appears to exclude the possibility that stellar explosions are the main mechanism that drive galactic winds .",
    "this is reasonable , since supernova - driven gas flows can not escape from massive galaxies potential wells .",
    "a resolution to this wind dilemma could come from the hypothesis of supermassive black hole  ( smbh ) induced outflows  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the very low value of the load factor  ( @xmath162 ) is consistent with this scenario since the smbh undergoes most of its growth in the gas rich phase and its outflow expels mostly unprocessed gas .",
    "although our model does not include the physics of smbhs , it is tempting to say that our best fit model suggests that smbhs should play a key role in the evolution of massive spheroids .    in general , we observe that the high dust correction case seems to stretch our model parameters to extreme values , suggesting either a strong tension between datasets ( mostly sfr and metallicity data ) or a failure of the model to fully encapsulate all of the relevant physical processes . even though with a reduced chi ",
    "square per dof of @xmath163 this scenario is less favoured than the hierarchical star formation model discussed above , it appears that the monolothic formation model can not be dismissed yet .",
    "it is interesting that our 7 parameter model is able to describe both cases , and that the sfr dust correction plays a major role in defining which scenario is preferred .",
    "we now turn to discuss the most relevant correlations among the model parameters in light of their physical interpretation and of their impact on the observables , as shown in section  [ sec : sensitivity ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d ] shows a selection of 2d joint posterior probability distributions for @xmath95 , @xmath55 , @xmath46 , @xmath73 , @xmath72 , and @xmath164 , thus giving complementary information to the 1d distributions plotted in figure  [ fig:1d ] .",
    "the contours enclose joint 2d @xmath165 and @xmath166 regions , with all other parameters marginalized , for both the `` high dust correction '' ( dashed ) and the `` normal dust correction '' case  ( solid ) .    in the first panel on the left of figure  [ fig:2d ] , showing the @xmath167 plane , we observe a positive correlation between the imf power  law index and the sn type ii energy efficiency factor .",
    "this is expected , since an imf with a higher power  law index produces less sne , each of which has to contribute more energy , leading to higher values for the parameter @xmath55 ( compare figures  [ fig : sen_e ] and [ fig : sen_x ] , panels showing the sfr and metallicity dependence ) . for the``high dust correction '' case ( dashed lines )",
    "this correlation is weaker , confirming our conclusion that sne type ii can not drive the winds in the massive spheroids .",
    "the @xmath168 plane shows that for structures of smaller mass ( `` normal dust correction '' case , solid lines ) the parameter @xmath63 needs to be large , while for high mass structures ( as preferred in the``high dust correction '' case , dashed curves ) , @xmath63 is essentially unconstrained , indicating that sne feedback is irrelevant for massive spheroids .",
    "the different physical processes taking place in small structures and massive spheroids can be further investigated by looking at the correlations in the @xmath169 plane .",
    "we expect to find a positive correlation among @xmath73 and the dilution factor @xmath140 , as larger @xmath73 increases the sfr ( compare figure  [ fig : sen_v ] ) thus leading to a more metal  rich ism . to bring this back in line with the data , a larger dilution factor is needed .",
    "the above line of reasoning explains the strong positive correlation one observes for the high mass structures ( dashed ) where winds do not play a strong role and metals can not escape from the structure .",
    "in contrast , metal ",
    "rich winds are dominant for smaller structures ( solid curves ) , thus expelling most of the metals produced .",
    "this results in almost no correlation between @xmath164 and @xmath73 , since the impact of @xmath73 on the sfr and metallicity predictions can be mimicked by a different combination of values for @xmath63 and @xmath95 .",
    "finally , in the right  most panel of figure  [ fig:2d ] , we display the probability distribution in the @xmath170 plane , which exhibits a strong negative correlation . again",
    ", this is expected on the grounds that large values of the parameter @xmath73 increase the sfr ( compare figure  [ fig : sen_v ] ) and a smaller time ",
    "scale is thus required in order to quench star formation fast enough ( see figure  [ fig : sen_t ] ) .",
    "we have presented a well  motivated physical model of the cosmic star formation incorporating supernova feedback , gas accretion and enriched outflows .",
    "we computed the cosmic star formation history and the chemical evolution in the interstellar medium of forming galaxies as a function of redshift , and we presented for the first time a full statistical treatment of the observational data , which accounts for the possibility of systematic errors in the data sets .",
    "we have employed four different observational data  the observed cosmic star formation rate up to @xmath171 , the observed rate of type ii supernova up to @xmath172 , the present baryon fraction in structures and the evolution of the metal content in the ism  to derive constraints on the free parameters of our model . after employing a bayesian procedure to rebin the sfr and sn rate data",
    ", we found that the low redshift ( @xmath154 ) sfr dust correction adopted has a critical impact on the scenario favoured by the data .    for what we have termed `` normal dust correction '' , the hierarchical star formation model is preferred , where star formation occurs in small structures first and",
    "supernovae winds are important .",
    "while the winds load factor remains poorly constrained , we can conclude that larger values are preferred , in agreement with previous work @xcite . applying a larger dust correction at small redshifts",
    ", we found that the data on the contrary favour high values for the minimum mass of a dark halo of the collapsed structures ( monolithic star formation scenario ) .",
    "this case requires a large dilution factor , a rather extreme imf slope and a fairly small winds load factor , at the model parameters are pushed at the boundaries of the available range .",
    "we have suggested that this might be interpreted in terms of the presence of outflow from supermassive black holes , but this possibility will require further investigation .",
    "it is worth noticing that the monolithic star formation scenario has very little star formation beyond @xmath1 .",
    "observations of the e  mode polarization power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background however indicate that the universe was re ",
    "ionized around @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this means that in this scenario the reionization mechanism has to be found elsewhere than in massive uv  emitting stars .",
    "several alternatives have been explored in the literature , for example reionization by decaying particles ( ) , or a high  redshift population of mini  quasars that can reionize the igm up to @xmath173 ionisation fraction ( ) .    for both models",
    ", the imf slope is large .",
    "unfortunately , this does not help in distinguishing one model from the other , since observations have so far not yielded convincing results concerning the form of the stellar imf or its variations in space and time  @xcite .",
    "the most important difference among the imfs is that the fraction of high  mass stars is larger for a shallower imf .",
    "since only high  mass stars emit significant amount of ultraviolet light , this results in a spectrum which is more shifted towards the ultraviolet for a typical galaxy with an e.g. salpeter imf  ( @xmath174 ) as compared with a scalo imf  ( @xmath127 ) . in turn , this leads to a different reionization history , which can be in principle compared with the optical depth to reionization as inferred from cosmic microwave background polarization measurements .",
    "while the monolithic scenario is less preferred in terms of quality of fit , it is clear that more work is required to be able to draw firm conclusions as to the viability of the two different models .",
    "of particular importance remains the statistical treatment of the data , for which we have here presented a new procedure that we hope will prove useful for future work .",
