    "the continuing search for new superconductors has recently resulted in the identification of a new family of superconducting phosphide compounds with the chemical composition _ _ a__pt@xmath0p ( _ a _ = sr , ca , or la).@xcite these materials , whose superconductivity has been claimed to be driven by conventional electron - phonon interactions , adopt a distorted anti - perovskite structure , resembling the structure of several noncentrosymmetric superconductors , such as lapt@xmath0si or cept@xmath0si.@xcite contrary to the latter , however , srpt@xmath0p exhibits an inversion center due to the staggered arrangement of pt octahedra .",
    "noncentrosymmetric superconductors , characterized by antisymmetric spin - orbit couplings , are currently the subject of intense research.@xcite therefore , a comparative study of their centrosymmetric counterparts is of particular interest .",
    "indeed , the sr - based compound of the new family , with a critical temperature @xmath7k , has already been investigated in some detail .",
    "the first study included measurements of the specific heat @xmath8 and hall resistivity @xmath9.@xcite the specific - heat data were interpreted as indicating a strong electron - phonon coupling with a relatively large ratio @xmath10 , and a fully - gapped excitation spectrum below @xmath4 with a zero - temperature gap value @xmath11 mev .",
    "the nonlinear magnetic field dependence of hall resistivity was attributed to the presence of multiple fermi - surface pockets .",
    "less details are known on lapt@xmath0p , whose critical temperature @xmath12k@xcite is distinctly lower than that of the sr compound , the difference being most likely due to the different valencies of the cations .    there",

    ", it is argued that a conventional phonon - mediated superconductivity is observed.@xcite density - functional - theory calculations@xcite suggest that the onset of superconductivity is due to a strong coupling between the @xmath13-hybridized bands with low - energy phonon modes confined in the @xmath14 plane of the crystal lattice .",
    "the 2d character of these modes seems essential to preserve the antipolar arrangement of the distorted pt octahedra in srpt@xmath0p , thus enhancing both the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath15 and , consequently , the critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the only experimental investigation at a microscopic level cited in the literature focused on muon - spin rotation ( @xmath16sr ) measurements.@xcite the established temperature dependence of the penetration depth in the form of @xmath17 again indicated a single gap with a value of @xmath18mev .",
    "however , an upward curvature of the upper critical field @xmath19 just below @xmath4 was interpreted as reflecting two - band superconducivity with equal gaps but differing values of the coherence lengths .    in this work",

    "overall the data indicate that srpt@xmath0p is a rather simple metal and that the pairing configuration is most likely of spherically - symmetric ( @xmath5-wave ) character . a comparison with the noncentrosymmetric superconductors lapt@xmath0si and cept@xmath0si is intended to clarify the peculiarities of the latter . the lack of inversion symmetry of the crystal lattice may partly account for the much lower @xmath4 of lapt@xmath0si , while the rare - earth cations seem responsible for the unusual electronic properties of cept@xmath0si.@xcite",

    "analogous measurements probing the normal state in the same temperature regime were made in a field of @xmath32 t , which exceeds the zero - temperature upper critical field @xmath33t,@xcite and , for monitoring the superconducting transition , in a 0.6-t field across a restricted temperature range around the relevant @xmath4 .    in order to achieve an acceptable signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio ,",
    "the sample was powdered to a grain size of the order of 10@xmath16 m and kept in the form of a loose powder , hence reducing the electrical contact between the grains .",
    "nmr measurements at the above - mentioned external magnetic fields were made at different temperatures between 1.6 and 300k by employing a conventional phase - coherent spectrometer .",
    "the @xmath20p spectra were obtained by fast fourier transformation ( fft ) of the spin - echo signals generated by @xmath34 rf pulses with a 200-@xmath16s delay between pulses ( the measured transverse relaxation time is @xmath35 of ca .  500 @xmath16s ) .",
    "since the employed `` hard '' rf pulses ( @xmath36 @xmath16s ) excite non - selectively the entire resonance line , no difference between fixed- and swept - frequency lineshapes was observed .",
    "the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation times @xmath37 were measured at the peak position of each nmr line by means of the inversion - recovery method , using spin - echo detection at variable delays .",
    "the magnetic field was calibrated via @xmath38al nmr of elemental aluminum , whose gyromagnetic ratio and knight shift are known to high precision .",

    "[ fig : shifts ] , the line width , of the order of 7khz at room temperature , increases gradually by approximately 50% down to ca .",

    "as for the line shifts in the normal phase , a moderate increase upon lowering the temperature is observed .",
    "this increase is mostly linear down to approximately 50k , below which the line shift remains constant down to @xmath4 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : shifts_2_vs_7 t ] ) .",
    "the constancy of the shift above the superconducting transition is a feature often observed in simple metals with an only weakly - varying electronic susceptibility @xmath41 .",
    "the relative shift , of the order of 0.12% , is close to that observed in simple metals such as ag and na and is the same for the 2- and 7-t external fields , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shifts_2_vs_7 t ] ) . the line widths measured in a field of 7 t , instead , are approximately twice as large as those recorded at @xmath42 t , which , in turn , are three times larger than those at 0.6 t .",
    "thus the linewidth scales almost linearly with the applied field .",
    "the most interesting results are obtained below @xmath4 , where the inhomogeneous field distribution in the mixed state of a type - ii superconductor significantly broadens the nmr line .",
    "[ fig : shifts ] shows the steep increase of the line width , from 10 to ca .",

    "of the two possibilities , the experimental data rule out the occurrence of a @xmath43-wave sc pairing , since in that case , the drop of the knight shift would be less abrupt and the line broadening would reach its asymptotic @xmath44k value only gradually.@xcite from these static nmr results , an @xmath5-type pairing seems to be the most plausible configuration adopted by electrons in the superconducting state of srpt@xmath0p .",
    "@xmath1p nmr shift ( left scale ) and linewidth ( right scale ) vs.  temperature , as measured at an applied field of 2 t .",
    "the drop in shift and the increase in width below @xmath4 are followed by a constant behavior at intermediate temperatures and by a final decrease at higher @xmath29 ( see text for details ) .",
    "the increase of data scattering below @xmath4 reflects the decreased s / n ratio in the superconducting phase . ]",

    "@xmath1p nmr spin - lattice relaxation data of srpt@xmath0p at selected temperatures measured at 2 t .",

    "temperature dependence of @xmath53 measured in a magnetic field of 2 t .",
    "a similar cusp - like feature at @xmath4 is seen also at 0.6 t .",
    "the decrease below the maximum occurring at @xmath4 is compatible with a fully - gapped superconductor ( see text ) .",

    "the progressive deviation from the linear - in-@xmath29 behavior above @xmath56 reflects a decrease in the dynamical spin susceptibility , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssec : korringa ] and [ ssec : susceptibility ] .",
    "focusing back on the superconducting state , just below @xmath4 we do not observe a distinct hebel - slichter ( coherence ) peak , but only a cusp - like feature peaking at @xmath4 .",
    "analogous data taken in a 0.6-t field showed essentially the same type of feature in the vicinity of @xmath4 .",
    "we recall that the hebel - slichter anomaly is due to pair coherence and to a quasiparticle density - of - states anomaly at the gap edge and is more pronounced at lower fields , where the pair - breaking effect of the field is less important.@xcite both these effects can be weakened by different causes , including interaction anisotropies and the broadening of the quasiparticle states due to strong - coupling effects .",
    "indeed , while _ weakly_-coupled conventional @xmath5-wave superconductors , typically exhibit a hebel - slichter peak , this is not the case in the _ strong_-coupling limit , where the enhanced electron - phonon coupling implies reduced quasiparticle lifetimes.@xcite since the lack of a coherence peak can not rule out the possibility of an @xmath5-type electron pairing,@xcite further analysis is required .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath37 at @xmath2 can provide information about the symmetry of the superconducting gap . in case of an anisotropic gap with nodes , a power - law dependence , @xmath57 ,",
    "is expected since very low - energy electronic excitations around gap nodes can still contribute to relaxation .",
    "on the other hand , for standard fully - gapped superconductors with no or a weak gap anisotropy , the relaxation rate depends exponentially on temperature , @xmath58 , with @xmath59 the superconducting gap at @xmath44 . in either case , non - negligible @xmath3 residual values",
    "may be observed at the lowest temperatures .",
    "is likely of intrinsic origin .",
    "] most likely these are due to the presence of vortex - core or of thermally - excited vortex - motion relaxation mechanisms,@xcite which can be accounted for by an additional constant term .",
    "while both models provide reasonable fits to the data , the power - law expression shows a somehow poorer fit quality and , most importantly , the resulting exponent varies significantly ( from 3.6 for the 2-t dataset to 2.7 for the data collected at 0.6 t ) . on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : relaxations ] , an exponential curve with @xmath60mev fits the srpt@xmath0p relaxation data satisfactorily well .",
    "also the data taken at 0.6 t can be consistently fitted with a similar gap value , @xmath61mev , thus providing a good indication that the superconducting gap of srpt@xmath0p is nodeless . the value of the gap parameter , although slightly modified by the presence of the constant term , is in fair agreement with the 1.55mev value reported in ref .  , but distinctly lower than @xmath11mev reported in ref .  .",
    "in any case , since the gap value from our analysis is clearly higher than 1.27 mev ( the gap expected from the bcs formula @xmath62 ) , it is compatible with a strong - coupling scenario .",
    "besides the vortex - core relaxation mechanism mentioned above , the almost constant value of @xmath3 well below @xmath4 might also reflect a certain degree of superconducting - gap anisotropy , but we consider this as a less likely possibility .",
    "some insight into the degree of electronic correlations in the normal state of a material can be gained by considering the so - called korringa relation@xcite @xmath63 here @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the electronic and the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios , respectively , while @xmath66 is the line shift due to the polarized conduction electrons .",
    "( [ eq : korringa_r ] ) reflects the fact that both the readily accessible experimental parameters , the knight shift @xmath66 and the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath37 , depend on the same electron - nucleus hyperfine interaction ( assumed to be mostly of fermi - contact character ) .",
    "however , while for a simple ( fermi - gas ) metal the parameter @xmath67 is a constant ( depending only on @xmath65 of the probe - nucleus ) , for real materials the generalized relation@xcite @xmath68 , with @xmath69 a measure of the strength of the ( fermi - liquid ) quasiparticle interactions,@xcite is more appropriate .",
    "since @xmath3 probes the dynamical susceptibility averaged over the brillouin zone , either fm or afm spin correlations will enhance it , but only fm correlations can significantly enhance also the shift .",
    "thus , @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) indicates the presence of ferro- ( antiferro-)magnetic electronic correlations .    from the almost constant value of @xmath72 vs.",
    "@xmath29 ( see inset in fig .  [",
    "fig : relaxations ] ) and considering the negligible orbital shift contribution ( see below ) , we find @xmath73 and , hence , @xmath74 in our case .",
    "the resulting value , slightly larger than unity , seems to suggest the presence of ferromagnetic correlations in the normal state . however , the ratio @xmath73 is similar to 0.58 , 053 , and 0.50 observed in typical metals such as lithium , cesium , and silver , respectively.@xcite in these nearly - free - electron metals the moriya theory of exchange enhancement , whereby the exchange fluctuations also enhance the rate of the @xmath37 process,@xcite explains the experimental data satisfactorily .",
    "consequently , we conclude that also in srpt@xmath0p the conduction electrons experience rather weak correlation effects , in good agreement with the results reported in ref .  .",

    "such a comparison of micro- ( nmr ) vs.  macroscopic ( magnetometry ) results provides further information about the normal - state electronic properties of srpt@xmath0p . in our case ,",
    "given the relative insensitivity to the applied field ( see fig .",

    ", we conclude that the key differences between the considered centro- and non - centrosymmetric superconductors , are most likely related to the presence of ce@xmath105 ions and the ensuing heavy - fermion phenomena , while the parity mixing alone ( common to both lapt@xmath0si and cept@xmath0si ) can not explain the peculiar behavior of the latter . despite the many similarities between srpt@xmath0p and lapt@xmath0si , their belonging to different classes of crystal symmetry",
    "may possibly explain their distinctly different critical temperatures .",
    "incidentally , from the available data in literature , also the centrosymmetric lapt@xmath0p compound seems most likely to be a conventional bcs type - i superconductor .",
    "we presented the results of @xmath1p nmr measurements in the recently discovered srpt@xmath0p superconducting compound . in the normal state ,",
    "the nuclear spin - relaxation rate obeys a korringa - type relation @xmath106 ( sk)@xmath107 and the line shift is independent of temperature . in the superconducting state ,",
    "the lack of a clear coherence peak in @xmath108 just below @xmath4 , most likely due to a strong electron - phonon coupling , is followed by an exponential , thermally - activated decrease upon further cooling .",
    "a similar behavior is shown also by the line shift .",
    "the overall results of our nmr investigation make us conclude that srpt@xmath0p , which behaves as a standard metal in the normal state , is characterized by singlet pairing of the electrons , and a gap function with conventional @xmath5-wave - type symmetry .",
    "finally , a comparison with the analogous non - centrosymmetric superconductors lapt@xmath0si and cept@xmath0si , strongly suggests that the peculiarities of the latter are closely related to the presence of rare - earth cations .",
    "the lack of inversion symmetry may cause a much lower @xmath4 , however .",
