    "the study of the electronic structure of the solid compounds with the impurities within density functional theory could be performed in two ways .",
    "one is the supercell method when the unit cell of parent compound is enlarged by several times and one of the atoms is replaced by the atom of impurity .",
    "this method has two basic shortcomings : first , the atoms of impurity are turned out to be ordered and second , only discrete concentration could be treated ( specified by the number of unit cells ) .",
    "another approach is the coherent potential approximation developed in the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the cpa is the modification of the electronic green function by introducing the coherent potential describing self - consistent effective medium containing randomly distributed impurity .",
    "the compounds with arbitrary concentration and disordered impurities could be naturally treated within this approach .",
    "the main objects of investigation studied within cpa until now are the transition metal and semi - conductor alloys ( for instance ga - as ) , which generally have quite similar potentials of matrix and impurity atoms .",
    "recently the cpa was also applied for nonstoichiometric materials with vacancies in metallic and nonmetallic sublattices ( tio@xmath3 , tio@xmath4 , tio@xmath5c@xmath2n@xmath4 )  @xcite .    in searching the alloy theory based on first principles the large efforts have been made to combine cpa with different methods of electronic structure calculation in the 1980s and 1990s .",
    "the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) method was combined with cpa approach and applied to the cu - ni alloy  @xcite .",
    "the kkr - cpa was found to be very time consuming .",
    "the well known problems with the energy dependence of the structure constants which takes most of calculation time can be solved by linear approaches in the band theory of ordered systems like linearized muffin - tin orbitals method ( lmto ) .",
    "the next step was the realization of tb - lmto - cpa method proposed by kudrnovsk and drchal  @xcite though some difficulties with the brillouin zone integration remain .",
    "the efficient scheme for obtaining the electronic properties of random solid solutions was developed on the basis of cpa and lmto green function method by abrikosov et al . and applied for cu - ni and cu - au alloys  @xcite . in the last few years",
    "the interest to the cpa approach is revived mainly because of its natural incorporation into the lda+dmft computational scheme .",
    "such combination gives opportunity for investigation of strongly correlated disordered systems .",
    "the topical review of the fully self - consistent kkr - based local spin density approximation + dynamical mean field theory ( lsda+dmft ) scheme and its application to the ordered and disordered compounds was performed by minr  @xcite .",
    "this scheme was successfully employed to fe@xmath2ni@xmath1 alloy  @xcite , co - pt solid - state systems  @xcite and magnetic alloy system ni@xmath2pd@xmath1  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the scheme for calculation of electronic structure of strongly correlated disordered systems based on the cpa .",
    "this method is applied for investigation of electronic structure and magnetic moment of the strongly correlated nio - zno solid solutions .",
    "the comparison with available experimental data is performed .",
    "the current scheme is conceptually close to the dynamical mean field theory dmft  @xcite . in present version",
    "the strong correlations are treated in the static mean - field limit , while the fully self - consistent cpa - dmft method is the challenge for the future work .",
    "the comprehensive review on the cpa methodology could be found in @xcite . below the basic equations of current cpa scheme",
    "are presented .",
    "the self - consistent coherent potential approximation cycle starts from the calculation of single - site electronic green function @xmath6 on the imaginary axis : @xmath7 where @xmath8 ,   are the odd matsubara frequencies , @xmath9=1/t is inverse temperature , @xmath10 is a chemical potential , @xmath11 is the unit matrix , @xmath12 is the hamiltonian of the system without impurity , the summation runs over * k * vectors of reciprocal lattice in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone , @xmath13 is starting coherent potential . as in the dynamical mean - field theory @xmath14",
    "is assumed to be * k * independent which is correct in the limit of @xmath15 and hence all calculated green functions are wave vector independent .    the self - consistent solution is achieved if the single - site green function ( [ eq : g_iw ] ) coincide with the green function of single impurity model @xmath16 .",
    "let us call the part of the green function corresponding to effective medium ( the sites on which the impurity is uniformly distributed ) as @xmath17 .",
    "then the dyson equation for the green function of the bath will have the form @xmath18 the effective green function at the sites containing the impurity with concentration @xmath0 has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the difference in potentials between the `` impurity '' and `` host '' atoms .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : g_new ] ) replaces the solution of the single impurity anderson model in dmft method .",
    "new coherent potential could be obtained from equation ( [ eq : g_0 ] ) : @xmath23 then the new coherent potential is used in equation ( [ eq : g_iw ] ) and procedure of searching of @xmath14 is repeated until the self - consistency condition will be fulfilled . finally , to calculate the density of states ( dos ) , the self - consistent coherent potential @xmath24 is analytically continued to the real energy axis @xmath25 using the pad approximants @xcite .",
    "this scheme was developed and successfully applied to the investigation of the electronic structure of nonstoichiometric rutile  @xcite , titanium monoxide  @xcite , and titanium dioxide with carbon and nitrogen impurities in oxygen sublattice @xcite . in the case of titanium dioxide",
    "the scissors operator was employed to adjust the calculated energy gap value to the experimental one .",
    "the new feature of the current version of cpa is the treatment of the strongly correlations in the static mean - field limit  @xcite .",

    "the conventional band structure calculation of the pure system was carried out within tb - lmto - asa ( tight binding - linearized muffin - tin orbitals - atomic sphere approximation ) code @xcite .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the pure system have been derived in the basis of wannier functions using the projection procedure @xcite .",
    "the second step is the calculation of the difference in potentials between the `` impurity '' and `` host '' atoms , @xmath22 .",
    "generally one should simulate the single impurity embedded in the host matrix and calculate the difference of their potentials .",
    "the @xmath22 is obtained from the self - consistent band structure calculation of the supercell in which one of the atoms in the matrix is replaced by the atom of the impurity .",
    "the supercell should be large enough to have an atom of the matrix which does not have the impurity atom in its at least nearest neighbor surrounding .",
    "then the hamiltonian of the supercell is transformed in the wannier function basis and difference in potentials between impurity atom and the outermost of it host atom is derived .",
    "we would like to stress here that the supercell approach is used only for @xmath22 estimation .    in the presented cpa scheme",
    "the impurity is supposed to be uniformly distributed among all sites of the matrix .",
    "this implies that the symmetry of the lattice dose not change .",
