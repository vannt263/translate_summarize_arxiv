    "a random tessellation ( or mosaic ) of a @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space is a locally finite family of pairwise non - overlapping @xmath1-dimensional random convex polytopes  called cells of the tessellation  that cover the whole space . whereas non - random tessellations and tilings are a central object in discrete geometry , random tessellations form one of the classical random structures considered in stochastic geometry ( see @xcite for some classical theory and @xcite for some more recent developments ) .",
    "the most popular models are hyperplane or voronoi tessellations , where mainly the poisson case has been studied .",
    "all these tessellations share the property of being side - to - side or facet - to - facet in higher dimensions . in recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest also in tessellation models that do not fulfill this property . in @xcite a first systematic study of the complications is given when a tessellation is not side - to - side or facet - to - facet .",
    "tessellations of this kind arise for example by subsequent cell division , see @xcite , which makes them interesting for particular applications in geology , material sciences or biology . however , such models have a much more complex structure , because the spatial arrangement of their cells can be rather complicated .",
    "this implies that tessellations of this kind carry a rich combinatorial structure .",
    "for example it is no more necessarily the case that the number of facets of a cell coincides with the number of its neighboring cells .",
    "it is therefore interesting to calculate a number of geometric mean values for the cells , its facets , its ridges , its vertices and other interesting classes of objects that are determined by the tessellation .",
    "they describe in some sense the ` mean ' cell - arrangement and allow some insight to the complex tessellation geometry .    among these models for subsequent cell division",
    "the iteration stable or stit tessellations are of particular interest in recent time in stochastic geometry , because of the number of analytic available results , see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "a detailed combinatorial analysis of planar stit tessellations has been carried out in @xcite and the intent of this paper is to study the combinatorial structure of stit tessellations in @xmath2 .",
    "the structure of spatial stit tessellations is very rich and considerably more complex compared with the planar case , as we will see below .",
    "this is for the stit tessellations mainly due to the fact that they do not only have t - shaped vertices as in the planar case , but also vertices of so - called x - type .",
    "this causes that in a detailed analysis we have to take into account the effect generated by the different types of vertices . and , moreover , many distributional results depend on the joint distribution of t- and x - vertices in a delicate way .",
    "it is worth noticing that some basic mean values for the spatial stit model have already been determined in @xcite",
    ". they will be in the background of our analysis .",
    "based on the different vertex types a rather fine classification of the edges of the tessellation is introduced , similar to the edge classification of planar stit tessellations in @xcite .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the investigation of the proportion of these different edge types in the tessellation .",
    "these breakdowns of the class of edges into different subclasses are based on fine distributional properties for spatial stit tessellation that were developed in @xcite and which will be further developed below .",
    "they finally allow us to calculate a couple of new mean values , which describe the fine combinatorial structure and considerably refine the results from @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we recall the basic construction of stit tessellations in subsection [ subsec : stits ] and recall in subsection [ subse : typicalobjects ] the definition and interpretation of object intensities , typical objects and object adjacencies . in section [ sec : basicstructure ] we introduce the basic geometric objects determined by a spatial stit tessellation and their basic combinatorial structure from @xcite in order to keep the paper self - contained .",
    "our main results are the content of section [ sec : finestructure ] . before presenting them",
    "we first take care of some vertex geometry in subsection [ subsec : vertex geometry ] and develop as a technical tool some new identities for so - called i - segments in subsection [ subsec : isegmentdistributions1 ] that play an important rle in our further analysis . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : edgeclassification ] we explain our refined edge classifications and calculate the probabilities that the typical edge of a stit tessellation belongs to one of our classes .",
    "these probabilities are needed in subsection [ subsec : newmeanvalues ] to express a number of new geometric mean values that are related to a fine combinatorial structure of spatial stit tessellations . a summary and a discussion of our results",
    "are presented in section [ sec : summary ] , whereas all proofs are the content of the final section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "this section is devoted to some preparatory work .",
    "we first recall the basic construction of spatial stit tessellations and thereafter we formalize the concept of intensities as well as typical and adjacent objects of classes of geometric objects that are related to our model .",
    "moreover , some basic notation will be fixed .",
    "+       iteration stable tessellations ( called stit tessellations for short ) have formally been introduced by nagel and wei  in @xcite .",
    "we confine ourself here to a less formal local description of stit tessellations and refer to @xcite for more details . to this end ,",
    "let @xmath3 be a compact convex polytope , and let @xmath4 be a translation invariant measure on the space @xmath5 of planes in @xmath2 with the property that @xmath6)=1 $ ] , where @xmath7=\\{h\\in\\ch : h\\cap w\\neq\\emptyset\\}$ ] stands for the set of planes that hit the window @xmath8 .",
    "we assign now to @xmath8 a random lifetime which is exponentially distributed with parameter @xmath6)=1 $ ] .",
    "when this time has run out , we choose a plane @xmath9 according to the probability distribution @xmath10)$ ] and divide @xmath8 into the two sub - cells @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the two half - spaces generated by @xmath9 .",
    "these two random polytopes @xmath13 are now independently of each other equipped with exponentially distributed random lifetimes that have parameter @xmath14)$ ] and upon expiry of their lifetimes , we choose planes according to @xmath15)/\\l([w^\\pm])$ ] , respectively , and subdivide @xmath16 and @xmath17 further .",
    "this construction continues independently and recursively until a previously fixed deterministic time threshold @xmath18 is reached , see figures [ fig : stitconstruction ] and [ fig : stitconstructionfinal ] for illustrations .",
    "the outcome of this spatio - temporal construction , which is denoted by @xmath19 , is an almost surely finite collection of random convex polytopes that subdivides the convex polytope @xmath8 and can be considered as a tessellation of @xmath8 .",
    "it is a main result of @xcite that the described construction is spatially consistent .",
    "this is to say , there exists a whole space random tessellation @xmath20 with the property that @xmath21 has the same distribution as the previously constructed tessellation @xmath19 .",
    "the random tessellation @xmath20 is usually called a _",
    "stit tessellation_. the combinatorial structure of @xmath20 is in the focus of our interest in the present paper .",
    "we remark that the mean values and probabilities calculated below neither depend on the time threshold @xmath22 nor on the particular choice of the plane measure @xmath4 . for this reason these parameters are suppressed and we speak from now on about a spatial stit tessellation and",
    "we think of it as @xmath20 for some @xmath23 and some fixed measure @xmath4 .",
    "it is a crucial observation that the stit tessellations constructed in the previous subsection are spatially homogeneous , which is to say that the distribution of the shifted tessellation @xmath24 ( for some fixed measure @xmath4 as above ) is the same as that of @xmath20 for any @xmath25 .",
    "this allows us to make sense of several _",
    "object intensities_. to formalize the idea , let @xmath26 be some class of random geometric objects determined by the spatial homogeneous stit tessellations .",
    "for example @xmath26 can be the class of cells or the class of cell - separating polygons that are born in the course of the spatio - temporal construction .",
    "we assume from now on that all objects from @xmath26 are convex polytopes of a fixed dimension @xmath27 , @xmath28 ( this will always be the case below ) , which allows us to regard @xmath26 as a subset of the space @xmath29 of @xmath27-dimensional convex polytopes .",
    "for any @xmath30 let @xmath31 be the midpoint of the smallest circumscribed ball , the circumcenter .",
    "then the limit @xmath32 is well defined , where @xmath33 stands for a cube of volume @xmath34 , and @xmath35 for the indicator function which is @xmath36 if the statement in brackets is fulfilled and @xmath37 otherwise , cf .",
    "it will be assumed from now on that @xmath38 , which will be the case for all classes considered below . in view of ( [ eq : objectintensities ] ) it is clear that @xmath39 has an interpretation as the mean number of objects of class @xmath26 per unit volume . moreover , the spatial homogeneity of the tessellation implies that @xmath39 does not depend on the choice and the spatial location of @xmath40 .",
    "we are now going to explain what can be considered as the typical object of a class @xmath26 as above .",
    "more precisely , we will define the _ distribution _ of the typical object and refer to @xcite for more details . besides @xmath29 , @xmath28 , define @xmath41 , where @xmath42 denotes the origin .",
    "the space @xmath43 can be equipped with the borel @xmath44-field @xmath45 generated by the usual hausdorff distance .",
    "we define now a distribution @xmath46 on @xmath43 by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath26 is an object class of @xmath27-dimensional polytopes . a random element in @xmath43 with distribution @xmath46",
    "is called the _ typical object _ of class @xmath26 and @xmath46 is said to be the _ distribution of the typical object_. intuitively it can be considered as a uniformly selected object from @xmath26 independent of its size and shape .    besides the object intensity @xmath39 also certain adjacency relationships are of interest for us . to define them ,",
    "let @xmath49 be another class of objects determined by a spatial stit tessellation and call @xmath50 and @xmath51 _ adjacent _ if either @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "for fixed @xmath50 , we denote by @xmath54 the number of objects from @xmath49 adjacent to @xmath55 and further define @xmath56:=\\begingroup\\textstyle\\int\\endgroup m_y(x)\\;\\bq_x(dx),\\ ] ] where in the expectation @xmath57 the subscript @xmath26 refers to integration with respect to @xmath46 .",
    "we interpret @xmath58 as the mean number of objects from @xmath49 that are adjacent to the typical object from @xmath26 .",
    "it is important to note that the first index in @xmath58 is the typical object to which the mean value refers to and that the second index indicates the class of objects to which the adjacency relationship is measured .",
    "thus , in general @xmath58 and @xmath59 are entirely different numbers",
    ". for example let @xmath26 be the class of cells and @xmath49 the class of vertices of the tessellation , then @xmath58 denotes the mean number of vertices of the typical cell , where s @xmath59 is the mean number of cells adjacent to the typical vertex .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt the convention that an upper case @xmath60 refers to the typical object of class @xmath26  excepting the case of indices for simplicity  and that a lower case @xmath55 is some representative of @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we will in some cases consider subclasses of @xmath26 , which will be denoted by @xmath61 $ ] , where the contents of the brackets @xmath62 $ ] will be a suitable suggestive symbol that is introduced in an ad hoc manner and whose meaning should be clear from the context .",
    "for example if @xmath26 is the class of vertices , @xmath63 $ ] could be the collection of vertices of a special type t.    to introduce some further notation we recall that we have assumed that the members of @xmath26 are convex polytopes having a certain dimension @xmath64 .",
    "then @xmath65 with @xmath66 will be the class of objects which are the @xmath67-dimensional faces of the polytopes from @xmath26 and , as above , @xmath68 stands for the typical object of @xmath65 .",
    "for example if @xmath26 is the class of tessellation cells ( here @xmath69 ) , then @xmath70 or @xmath71 are , respectively , the class of cell facets ( @xmath72-dimensional faces ) and ridges ( @xmath36-dimensional faces ) .",
    "furthermore , by @xmath73 and @xmath74 we denote , respectively , the topological boundary and the relative interior of the typical object from class @xmath26 .",
    "in this section we introduce the basic objects that are in the focus of our interest and recall some basic mean values that are related to intensities and adjacencies .",
    "these are taken from @xcite .",
    "the primitive objects of a spatial stit tessellation are its building blocks in some sense . by @xmath75 ( from the german word ` zellen ' )",
    "we denote the class of cells of the tessellation , which are the primitive objects of dimension @xmath0 . for a point @xmath25",
    "let @xmath76 be the intersection of all cells containing @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "we observe that @xmath76 is a finite intersection of random convex polytopes , whence @xmath76 itself is a random convex polytope .",
    "we can now introduce three other classes of primitive objects , namely @xmath78 the class of _ vertices _ and _ edges _ , and @xmath79 the class of _ plates_. it is important to note that the primitive elements as introduced above can not have an additional interior structure .",
    "for example , an edge or a plate can not have any vertex in its relative interior .",
    "nevertheless , the boundary structure of plates or cells can be rather complicated .",
    "for example a plate can be a triangle but with additional vertices on its boundary that are no corners of the triangle .",
    "the same also holds for the cells , whereby a cell can also have additional vertices and edges nested into its facets .",
    "the relative intensities of these classes of primitive elements for a spatial stit tessellation are @xmath80 moreover we have the following basic adjacency relationships for the primitive elements .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the average combinatorial structure of spatial random stit tessellations was in the focus of this paper .",
    "we have introduced several interesting classes of geometric objects that are determined by the tessellation and have recalled some basic mean values from earlier works .",
    "the main contribution of the present work is a detailed refined combinatorial analysis that involves various edge classifications .",
    "for example , we were able to explore the geometry of the neighbors of the typical vertex as well as the typical t- and the typical x - vertex .",
    "the related mean values involve the probabilities that the typical edge belongs to one of our introduced edge classes . these probabilities in turn arise from a detailed distributional analysis of the typical i - segment , which is also further developed in this paper .",
    "the reader might wonder why our refined combinatorial structures are based only on edges and not on a similar classification of plates , which are the @xmath72-dimensional primitive objects . clearly , a classification through the type of vertices is not very promising , because a plate can have arbitrary many corners or vertices on its boundary .",
    "however , a classification according to the equality relationship for plates with facets @xmath81 would be possible and would lead to a breakdown of @xmath82 in to the classes @xmath83 $ ] and to the related probabilities @xmath84}=\\bp(p\\in\\sp[z_2,i])$ ] for @xmath85 . to calculate these probabilities",
    ", one would need to investigate the geometry of i - polygons ( instead of i - segments ) . from @xcite",
    "is is known that the distribution of the typical i - polygon can be written as a mixture of typical cell distributions of certain poisson line tessellations . in order to calculate @xmath84}$",
    "] one would have to calculate the area distribution of the typical i - polygon , which  in view of the last sentence  reduces to the determination of the area distribution of a typical cell in a poisson line tessellation .",
    "this , however , is a long standing open problem in stochastic geometry .",
    "this way a calculation of the probabilities @xmath84}$ ] is currently out of reach .",
    "for this reason we had to restrict our work to the case of vertices and edges , which are analytically tractable , because of the line intersection property of stit tessellations , which tells us that the intersection of a stit tessellation with a line induces a homogeneous poisson point process on that line .",
    "point processes of this type are very well known and we can make use of their properties to gain detailed information about i - segments and edges .",
    "let us finally remark that for some of the quantities considered in this paper one can derive the whole distribution and not only the mean value .",
    "however , these distributions appear to be complicated in general and therefore we have here restricted our attention to first - order properties . to give a simple example for a distribution let us consider the number @xmath86}$ ] of @xmath87$]-edges that are located on the typical i - segment .",
    "it holds that @xmath88}=0)=p_0+p_1+\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty(1-p_{x|n}^2)^{n-1}p_n\\ ] ] and that @xmath88}=n)=\\sum_{n = n+1}^\\infty{n-1\\choose n}p_{x|n}^{2n}(1-p_{x|n}^2)^{n-1-n},\\qquad n\\geq 1,\\ ] ] with @xmath89 and @xmath90 given by ( [ eq : pm ] ) and ( [ eq : ptm ] ) , respectively . for small @xmath91",

    "in this subsection we continue the distributional analysis of the typical i - segment started in subsection [ subsec : isegmentdistributions1 ] and recall some other results from @xcite .",
    "they prepare the proofs presented below .",
    "firstly , formula ( [ eq : pm ] ) can be refined by considering the joint distribution of the number of t- and x - vertices in the relative interior of the typical i - segment .",
    "let us define @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) to be the probability that in its relative interior the typical i - segment has exactly @xmath95 t - vertices and @xmath67 x - vertices , i.e. @xmath96 . then @xmath97 see @xcite . besides the two probabilities @xmath89 from ( [ eq : pm ] ) and @xmath93 , we also need the probability @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) that on the typical i - segment exactly @xmath100 internal t - vertices are induced from polygons pointing to the left and @xmath101 to the right . it is given by @xmath102      let us consider the spatio - temporal construction of stit tessellations in the isotropic case , that is the case where the plane measure @xmath4 is the isometry invariant measure on @xmath5 , see subsection [ subsec : stits ] .",
    "( this is only for simplicity , the anisotropic case can also be considered , but then also the direction of the segment has to be taken into account",
    ". however , it appears that ( [ eq : plr ] ) is independent of the choice of the direction and hence independent of the plane measure @xmath4 used in the stit construction , see subsection [ subsec : stits ] . ) in this construction every i - segment receives a birth - time , which is defined as the birth - time of the i - polygon that creates the segment by intersection of another i - polygon that has been born earlier .",
    "the birth - time of the typical i - segment is denoted by @xmath103 . moreover",
    ", we denote by @xmath104 the length of the typical i - segment . from @xcite we know that the joint density @xmath105 of @xmath106 for the stit tessellation @xmath20 equals @xmath107 we condition now on the event that @xmath108 and conclude from the intersection property of stit tessellations that under this condition the number @xmath109 of left - pointing t - vertices and the number @xmath110 of right - pointing t - vertices in the relative interior of the typical i - segment are independent and poisson distributed with parameter @xmath111 , which is to say @xmath112 see for example @xcite or the references cited therein .",
    "averaging with respect to the joint density @xmath105 yields @xmath113 where in the last step we have applied the substitution @xmath114 .",
    "this proves our claim.@xmath115        recall that by @xmath93 ( @xmath116 ) we denote the probability that the typical i - segment contains exactly @xmath95 internal vertices from @xmath117 $ ] and @xmath67 internal vertices from @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "note , moreover , that @xmath119 is the probability that the typical i - segment has internal vertices .",
    "thus , given the typical i - segment contains exactly @xmath120 internal vertices , and given that @xmath121 of them are of type @xmath122 , the probability for choosing a t - vertex is @xmath123 .",
    "averaging over all possible numbers @xmath95 and @xmath124 we find @xmath125 where the factor @xmath126 comes from conditioning on the event that the typical i - segment has internal vertices as explained above .",
    "combining now ( [ eqpt ] ) with ( [ eq : pxt ] ) we calculate @xmath127 as follows : @xmath128 the precise value for @xmath127 is obtained by taking into account that @xmath129 . in addition , the relation @xmath130 implies the value for @xmath131 , which completes our argument.@xmath115      now we use for the internal vertices of type t on the typical i - segment the same method as in the proof of part ( a ) above and show @xmath132 , see remark 2 following theorem [ thm : vertexinisegment ] .",
    "given the typical i - segment contains m internal vertices of type t , and @xmath100 of them point to the left , the probability for choosing a left - pointing t - vertex is @xmath133 . averaging yields for @xmath134 the expression @xmath135 where the factor 1/@xmath136 comes from conditioning on the event @xmath137 . to evaluate the double sum we use ( [ eq : plr ] ) , which yields @xmath138 by interchanging summation with integration , compare with the proof of part ( a ) .",
    "it remains to calculate the probability @xmath136 , which by using ( [ eq : pxt ] ) , is given by @xmath139 we thus find @xmath140 and @xmath141.@xmath115        we start by noting that any edge is located on exactly one i - segment and that the two endpoints of an i - segment are t - vertices .",
    "now we consider on the typical i - segment the different edge - types induced by the different internal vertices .",
    "if @xmath142 ( the typical i - segment has no internal vertices ) we have exactly one edge of type tt . if @xmath143 , then the typical i - segment comprises two tt - edges , if the internal vertex is of type t  an event having probability @xmath144 .",
    "and we have two tx - edges , if it is an x - vertex ( with probability @xmath145 ) . for @xmath146",
    "at first we are interesting in the edges , whose endpoints both are internal vertices of the i - segment . for @xmath147",
    "there are @xmath148 of these edges on the typical i - segment .",
    "if we uniformly select one of them , it is a tt - edge with probability @xmath149 , thanks to the independence of the vertex type of two neighboring vertices on an i - segment . and",

    "for this reason the mean number @xmath154}$ ] of edges of type tt that are located on the typical i - segment of the tessellation can be calculated by @xmath155}=p_0 + 2p_{t|1}p_1+\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty(2p_{t|n}+(n-1)p_{t|n}^2)p_n.\\ ] ] we observe next that the intensity @xmath156}$ ] of tt - edges equals @xmath156}={\\lambda}_{i_1}\\mu_{{i_1},e[tt]}$ ] .",
