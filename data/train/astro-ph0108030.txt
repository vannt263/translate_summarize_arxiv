    "experiments aimed at measuring the anisotropy in the cmb require a combination of sensitive detectors and novel observing strategies .",
    "the observational goal is to measure micro - kelvin celestial variations in thermal emission with a telescope observing from an environment that is some ten million times brighter . below 90 ghz ,",
    "the detectors of choice have been high electron mobility transistor based amplifiers designed at nrao [ hemts , pospieszalski ( 1992 ) ] . above 90 ghz , bolometers are the best detectors [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "sis - based systems @xcite near 100 ghz have the speed and intrinsic sensitivity of transistor amplifiers though do not yet have the large instantaneous bandwidth of bolometers or hemts . over the past five years",
    ", instruments have been designed for direct mapping of the cmb [ e.g. , qmap , boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite , tophat ( 2001 ) ] , and for beam synthesis [ saskatoon ( sk ) @xcite , msam @xcite , tenerife / bolo @xcite , python @xcite , viper @xcite ] .",
    "more recently , interferometers based on hemt amplifiers have reported cmb anisotropy results [ cat @xcite , dasi @xcite , iac @xcite , cbi @xcite ] . though the primary data product of the interferometers and beam - synthesis experiments is the angular spectrum ,",
    "data taken with these techniques can be turned into maps ( e.g. , tegmark 1997 ) .",
    "conversely , there is always some filtering involved in the mapping experiments .",
    "a common element of these experiments is that they are limited by systematic error .    in this paper , we describe the instruments for the qmap experiment and the mobile anisotropy telescope on cerro toco ( mat / toco or toco for short ) .",
    "we supply the details necessary for assessing the quality of the data and reproducing the experimental method .",
    "qmap is described in part in devlin _",

    "balloon borne mapping experiments have a long history @xcite though highly interlocking scan strategies over limited regions of sky are more recent @xcite .",
    "qmap , which flew twice in 1996 , was the first of these to produce a `` true map '' of the cmb , complete with pre - whitening and full covariance matrices .",
    "qmap was comprised of a focal plane array of three dual polarized hemt channels with an angular resolution of roughly @xmath3 .",
    "the beam array was steered on the sky by a large chopping flat .",
    "toco used the qmap gondola and receiver refit to work with a mechanical cooler instead of liquid cryogens .",
    "it also employed two sis - based 144 ghz detector systems to improve the resolution to @xmath4 .",
    "toco employed the saskatoon - style beam synthesis strategy @xcite with eight independent detectors . instead of observing near the ncp from saskatoon , canada , we observed near the scp from the side of cerro toco in northern chile . at 144 ghz ,",
    "the atmospheric column density in saskatoon is too large for anisotropy measurements ; a high altitude site such as the chilean altiplano is required .",
    "toco operated for two seasons in 1997 and 1998 .",
    "the primary results and short description of the instrument are given in torbet _",
    "( 1999 ) and miller _ et al . _",
    "the @xmath4 resolution allowed us to locate the first peak in the angular spectrum at @xmath5 ( knox and page 2000 ) . in the context of the popular adiabatic cdm models , this shows that the universe is geometrically flat @xcite .",
    "the toco experiment is shown schematically in figure  [ fig:1mat_schematic ] .",
    "the part of the figure containing the optics and receiver is the qmap balloon gondola .",
    "the radar trailer , on which the gondola is mounted , has a separable magnesium base .",
    "three legs hold the base off the trailer and stabilize it .",
    "when the telescope is transported , the legs are removed .",
    "the radar trailer has a 1.4 m diameter precision bearing on which is mounted a 2.5 cm thick flat plate that holds the gondola .",
    "the plate and gondola are rotated using an on - axis dc motor .",
    "cmb observations are made with the telescope in a fixed position ; a brake holds the telescope in place allowing the motor to be shut off during observations and preventing it from drawing large currents or oscillating as it seeks the target position in high winds .",
    "the motor has a 15 cm diameter hole in the center through which cables and refrigerator hoses pass from the inside of the telescope to the outside .",
    "the compressor that runs the mechanical cryocooler is mounted on the trailer .",
    "the azimuth is instrumented with an absolute 17-bit encoder and a 20-bit resolver .",
    "radiation from the sky enters the dewar through a 15.25 cm diameter vacuum window made of 0.56 mm polypropylene and is collected with corrugated feed horns as shown in figure  [ fig : dewar_shells ] .",
    "three aluminum baffles define the entrance aperture , one is attached to the 40 k cold plate , one is attached to the dewar just inside the vacuum window , and one is attached to outside of the dewar .",
    "strips of aluminized mylar connecting the cold feeds to the ambient temperature dewar block rf interference and reduce optical loading on the cold stage . to prevent the formation of frost on the window",
    ", warm air is passed through a volume in front of the vacuum window defined by a saran wrap - covered aluminum cone attached to the outside of the dewar .",
    "two nrao sis mixers are attached to the @xmath6k stage of the dewar and six hemts are attached to the 40  k stage , two with center frequencies of 31 ghz ( in ka band ) and four with center frequencies of 42 ghz ( in q band ) .",
    "warm amplifiers , bandpass filters , noise sources , and local oscillator for the sis system are housed in a 293  k `` backpack '' attached to the outside of the dewar .",
    "the primary difference between the toco and qmap receiver configurations is that qmap used liquid cryogens and toco used a mechanical refrigerator to cool the hemts as well as the sis mixers .",
    "the sis configuration is shown in figure  [ fig : siscon ] .",
    "the mixers are coupled to the sky with conical corrugated feed horns .",
    "a round - to - rectangular transition at the base of the horn transforms the incoming signal to a single polarization which is added to a signal from the local oscillator using a 20 db branch line coupler .",
    "the combined signals are fed into the sis mixer block .",
    "a sliding backshort , connected to the outside of the dewar by a flexible shaft , is used to tune the sis mixer , while cold , for optimal coupling .",
    "the sis is biased through a bias t which allows transmission of the rf signal while blocking the dc bias voltage .",
    "an associated circuit controls and reads the current through and voltage across the sis .",
    "the signal then comes out of the bias t , goes through a 20 db 4 - 6  ghz isolator ( p & h labs ) and into a cold c - band ( 3.95 - 5.85 ghz ) hemt amplifier with 33  db gain , as diagrammed in figure 3 .",
    "the sis , branch line coupler , bias t , and c - band hemt amplifier were all designed and fabricated at the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) .",
    "the output of the cold hemt is carried on stainless steel semi - rigid coax from the cold stage to the backpack where it is amplified by a warm 44  db rf amplifier , filtered through a 3.5 - 6.5 ghz filter and detected with a detector diode ( hewlett - packard : @xmath7 db flatness and a typical sensitivity of 300 mv / mw ) . to increase the linearity and to bring the detector output into a convenient range ( @xmath8v ) ,",
    "the diode is shunted with a @xmath9  k@xmath10 resistor .",
    "the rf filter ensures that only rf radiation in the passband of the c - band if amplifier makes it through the system . the detected output",
    "is then amplified by 100 and sent to the data acquisition system .",
    "the if system temperature was measured in the lab with a heatable @xmath11 load and found to be @xmath12k . the net gain of the system is 73  db .",
    "the lo ( millimeter wave oscillator company ) consists of a cavity stabilized oscillator with an output frequency of 48 ghz which injection - locks a second oscillator , which in turn injection locks a high power gunn oscillator .",
    "the oscillator feeds a tripler with an output frequency of 144 ghz .",
    "this signal then goes through an attenuator , into a 3 db directional coupler and is carried by wr-6 waveguide to the cold stage . on the cold stage a @xmath13 hybrid splits the lo power and sends it to the two mixers .",
    "the third port of the coupler is used to couple test and calibration signals into the system .",
    "the total lo power is about 8.5 mw , @xmath14nw of which impinges on each sis mixer .",
    "figure  [ fig : hemt ] shows the configuration of the hemt receivers for the toco 1997 and 1998 observing seasons .",
    "the qmap configuration is almost identical .",
    "the radiation enters the dewar through the vacuum aperture described above and is collected using ka- and q - band corrugated horns . an orthomode transducer ( omt )",
    "splits the radiation into vertical and horizontal linear polarizations .",
    "the ka - band omt has a reflection coefficient of less than @xmath15db over the bandpass of the channel .",
    "the q - band omts have a reflection coefficient of less than @xmath16db .",
    "each polarization is carried by rectangular copper waveguide to a separate low noise nrao cryogenic hemt amplifier@xcite .",
    "the passband of the system is set by the amplifiers and waveguide cutoff at the low end and a filter at the high end .",
    "bends in the waveguide are limited to a radius of curvature of at least 1.5  cm in order to minimize reflections @xcite .    at the input to each hemt amplifier is a 20 db crossed - guide bethe hole coupler that is used to inject a noise pulse .",
    "there is one source for all four of the q - band channels and one for both ka - band channels .    upon leaving the dewar ,",
    "each of the ka - band signals travels through waveguide to a warm amplifier .",
    "ka2 , the vertically polarized channel ( table  [ tab : centroids ] ) , is amplified with a single warm amplifier with a gain of about 50 db and a noise figure of 3 - 4 db ( @xmath17k ) .",
    "the signal from ka1 , the horizontally polarized channel , was found to be compressed in a similar configuration so it is passed through an amplifier ( @xmath18  db ) , then through an attenuator ( -12 db ) and through a second amplifier ( also with @xmath19db ) before being detected with a diode .",
    "the net gain of the ka receiver chains is @xmath20db .",
    "the q - band signals , upon leaving the dewar , are carried via copper rectangular waveguide to 1 db insertion loss filters ( spacek ) that filters out the low frequency tail of the 60 ghz atmospheric oxygen line . following the filters the signal",
    "is amplified , sent through a band leveler ( designed individually for each channel by pacific millimeter ) and amplified again .",
    "the amplifiers are connected to the band leveler with a k - connector to waveguide transition .",
    "each amplifier has a gain of 26 - 28 db and a noise figure of @xmath21 db .",
    "tests of the system with and without the band levelers are discussed in monnelly ( 1996 ) .",
    "the net gain of each q - band system is @xmath22  db .    a diode detector ( millitech ) at the output of the final amplification stage of the hemt channels converts the incident power to a voltage .",
    "the diode sensitivity varies over the passband and with temperature but is typically @xmath23mv / mw .",
    "the output of the diode is connected to a low noise pre - amp with a typical gain of 100 and roughly 2 k@xmath10 input impedance .",
    "we tune the dc output by selecting this impedance .",
    "values vary by about a factor of 100 between different channels . the output of the pre - amp is buffered and sent to the data acquisition system .      in the qmap configuration ,",
    "the hemt amplifiers and the sis mixers are heat sunk to a cold plate that forms the bottom of the liquid helium reservoir .",
    "the outer tank of the dewar is filled with liquid nitrogen .",
    "the vapor pressures of both the nitrogen and helium are held at a constant value with mechanical regulators .",
    "the combination of pressure regulated cryogens and a balloon borne dewar produces a constant - temperature cold plate with minimal microphonics .    due to the expense and difficulty of transporting liquid cryogens to cerro toco",
    ", the toco receiver is cooled with a sumitomo cryogenic refrigerator ( srdk-408ba ) .",
    "the 40  k stage has 40  w of cooling power .",
    "the loading on the 40  k stage is dominated by hemt led s , waveguide connections between the cold and warm stages , and optical loading through the window . from the liquid cryogen boil - off rate in the qmap configuration",
    ", we determined that the total loading on this stage is @xmath24w .",
    "the total loading on the 4  k stage , where there is 1  w of cooling power , is @xmath25 mw .    in chile",
    ", diurnal variations in the optical loading led to variations in the temperature of the sis mixers of @xmath26mk .",
    "however , for the purposes of cmb anisotropy analysis , we used only data taken during the night when the temperatures were stable to better than 50 mk .",
    "the temperatures were monitored continuously and the small drifts accounted for in the analysis through a calibration model .",
    "there was also a temperature variation of approximately 10 mk synchronous with the refrigerator drive motor operating at 1.2 hz .",
    "this term is asynchronous with the chopping frequency , and the resulting gain fluctuations are too small to affect our results ( section  [ sec - systematics ] ) .",
    "the backpack that houses the warm electronics mounts on the dewar and is thermally controlled to within @xmath27  k over a typical night of observations . as with the cold stage ,",
    "the temperature is monitored continuously and the effects of drifts on gain are corrected in software .",
    "all microwave amplifiers are heat sunk to a common aluminum plate and their temperatures are monitored .",
    "the enclosure for the electronics has two levels of rf shielding and is filled with pieces of microwave absorber wrapped in plastic bags that serve the dual purpose of thermal insulator and absorber of stray microwave radiation ( perhaps from imperfect joints ) .",
    "all waveguide joints are wrapped with an absorber to prevent leakage of radiation into the rest of the system .",
    "we did not find any evidence for correlations between channels due to the instrument .",
    "if changes in rf impedance due to vibrations are synchronously modulated by the motion of the chopping mirror , the resulting microphonic lines can mimic a celestial signal .",
    "such `` microphonics '' can couple into the data , for example , through motion of the feeds or through strain in the microwave joints .",
    "if the coupling is large and variable , it can also affect the data even if it is asynchronous with the chopper .    in order to minimize this coupling , the cold head motor",
    "is vibrationally isolated from the dewar ( which is bolted to the gondola frame ) with a set of compensating flexible vacuum bellows .",
    "we also use bags of # 9 lead shot placed on the cold head to damp vibrations .",
    "the connections between the cold head and the cooled electronics are made with strips of high purity flexible copper braid that efficiently conducts heat and vibrationally isolates the detectors from the refrigerator head .    although microphonic levels were low at the beginning of the 1997 season , a microphonic coupling developed over the campaign that rendered the d - band data unusable for cmb observations . the coupling was manifest as 1.2 hz ( the cold head cycle )",
    "wings of a broad 90 hz line suggesting amplitude modulation of a 90 hz vibrational line .",
    "the source of the vibration was traced to a combination of the azimuthal drive motor and the chopper .",
    "it was corrected for the 1998 season by modifying these two systems .",
    "the electronic interference from the azimuthal drive motor was eliminated by installing a brake .",
    "the brake allows the motor to be shut off during cmb observations and prevents large currents from being drawn by the motor working to counteract wind loading . in addition , the chopper - induced vibrations were reduced by replacing the bearings in the chopper with flex pivots . as a result ,",
    "microphonic levels in the toco98 d - band data were negligible .",
    "microphonics were not a problem either year in the hemt data .",
    "the josephson junctions in the sis mixers are sensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "helmholz coils around the dewar were used to measure the dependence . with the coils",
    "absent , the area was mapped with a gauss meter to ensure that the ac fields from the chopper drive and cold head motor would not contaminate the data . to minimize potential magnetic coupling , high magnetic permeability material ( mu - metal )",
    "was wrapped around the outside of the chopper coils and around the cold head .",
    "not only is the magnetic field negligible , but the chopper synchronous component corresponds to values of @xmath28 that do not enter into the cmb analysis .    [ tab : centroids ]      the qmap / toco receiver was characterized in the lab before each campaign , but the most relevant characterizations are done while observing .",
    "we use the following definitions : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the receiver passband , @xmath31 is the effective center frequency and @xmath32 is the noise bandwidth @xcite for the radiometer equation . for rf frequencies and @xmath33 for audio ( @xmath34khz ) frequencies . ]",
    "the noise of hemt -based amplifiers has a @xmath35 characteristic @xcite . to parametrize it",
    ", we fit the power spectrum of the detector diode output to the following form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the system sensitivity in units of k - sec@xmath38 , @xmath39 is the integration time , and @xmath40 is the fractional gain fluctuation that gives rise to the @xmath35 form .",
    "when the bandwidth is very large , the gain fluctuations dominate as shown by wollack & pospieszalski ( 1998 ) .",
    "note that a @xmath35 noise spectrum corresponds to @xmath41 in the variance ( `` power '' ) of the detector output .",
    "we define the @xmath35 knee , @xmath42 , to be the frequency where the power spectrum ( square of equation  [ eq : det_noise ] ) increases by a factor of two over the value at high frequencies .",
    "the instrument bandpasses , @xmath43 , are measured in the lab for each channel .",
    "table  [ tab : centroids ] lists the center frequencies and effective noise bandwidths for each channel for each observing campaign as calculated from equation  [ eq : eff_bw ] .",
    "the sis is operated in double side band ( dsb ) mode .",
    "by convention we use the intermediate frequency ( if ) noise bandwidth in the radiometer equation and report `` double sideband noise temperatures , '' @xmath44 , because our source fills both rf bands . if a source fills just one rf band , a `` single sideband noise , '' @xmath45 ,",
    "is reported . in an ideal system , @xmath46 .",
    "we use the mean of the usb and lsb bandwidths for the noise bandwidth in the radiometer equation .",
    "a full calculation of the noise includes contributions from the mixer and the if amplifier @xcite ; for our purposes we treat these as lumped elements .",
    "measurements of the sis sensitivity have been made in several configurations as shown in table  [ tab : sis_sensitivity ] .",
    "the values of @xmath47 from laboratory measurements are better than those made in the field . to investigate this discrepancy",
    ", we built an external cold load that could be bolted onto the front of the receiver to mimic the sky .",
    "we found that it was possible to approximately reproduce the system temperatures measured with the internal load using an external load provided that the tuning parameters were readjusted .",
    "this retuning compensates primarily for the change in temperature of the mixer . in the 1998 season , the combination of thermal loading and increasingly poor refrigerator performance led to an increase in the sis temperatures and a temperature distribution different to that in the lab .",
    "even though the system was tuned in the field , the lab performance was not duplicated .",
    "the sis system noise exhibits a @xmath35 characteristic presumably due to the c - band hemt , though this has not been verified .",
    "the @xmath35 noise is parametrized following equation  [ eq : det_noise ] in the last two lines of table  [ tab : sis_sensitivity ] .",
    "[ tab : sis_sensitivity ]    [ tab : hemt_sensitivity ]      the same set of six hemt amplifiers were used for the two qmap flights and the two observing seasons of the toco experiment ; four of this set were used for the saskatoon measurement .",
    "they were tested in the lab before each set of observations and the sensitivities were analyzed for each data set ( table  [ tab : hemt_sensitivity ] ) .",
    "there is evidence of degradation in the hemt performance between the qmap and toco campaigns above that which is expected due to the difference in body temperature @xcite .",
    "generally hemt system noise is expected to increase roughly one kelvin for each kelvin of increased ambient temperature .",
    "we suspect slow deterioration in the mechanics of the microwave / bias structures over the hundreds of cycles and sometimes rough handling these amplifiers experienced .",
    "the chips were unpassivated inp so there may some deterioration in the chip performance though this has not been confirmed .",
    "the telescope optics are similar to those used in the saskatoon experiment  @xcite .",
    "corrugated feeds underilluminate a 0.86  m primary mirror which in turn underilluminates a flat ( 1.8  m@xmath481.2  m ) chopping mirror ( chopper ) .",
    "each of the eight channels detects a single mode of a diffraction limited beam .",
    "the chopper is a resonant , computer controlled mirror , that scans in the azimuthal direction while the rest of the optics remain fixed in azimuth and elevation as the sky rotates through the beams .",
    "the telescope sits inside an aluminum ground screen which is fixed with respect to the primary mirror , the receiver , and the chopper mount .",
    "[ tab : feeds ]      conical corrugated feed horns receive radiation from the sky and transform the incident fields so they may propagate through waveguide .",

    "the throat section , where the corrugations adiabatically transform from @xmath49 depth to @xmath50 depth as the hybrid mode detaches from the feed wall , was designed by wollack ( 1994 ) following the work of james ( 1982 ) the vswr is less than 1.05 across the waveguide band and the loss in the feed is negligible .",

    "the ka and q1/2 feeds were also used in the saskatoon experiments where they had three concentric choke grooves on the flange that defined the skyward aperture .",

    "outside of the data selection based on weather , most of the analysis effort goes into ensuring that offsets do not contaminate the final results .",
    "this section addresses the known offsets and sets upper limits on their magnitudes for both the case of when the source is chopper - modulated ( radiation which enters the detectors after being affected by the chopper ) and unmodulated ( radiation which enters the detectors directly ) .",
    "the offsets from modulated emission can , in principle , occur at any harmonic of the chopper frequency . ] . in practice , they are predominantly at the lowest spatial frequency harmonics .    in the following we focus on toco because the long observing campaigns required careful monitoring of the offsets . in qmap , because of the short durations of the flights , the offsets were stable . in the mapmaking analysis , the offsets were projected out of the cmb data using a technique described in de oliveira - costa _ et al . _",

    "the effect of this cut is to keep 5 - 10 hour blocks of continuous good data in any day and to eliminate transitions into periods of poor atmospheric stability . on a typical day that passes the initial _ rms _ cut ,",
    "an additional 40% of the synthesized data is removed due to atmospheric fluctuations .",
    "the net result is that 26% of the data are kept .    as discussed above ,",
    "data are placed into 768 bins in right ascension with ra=@xmath219 corresponding to the first bin .",
    "all data falling between bins 288 and 555 are cut in order to eliminate observations of the galaxy from the cmb analysis .",
    "this is equivalent to cutting all data with @xmath220 centered at @xmath221 . by observing at an azimuth of @xmath222 , the galaxy cut occurs during the day , when the data are not generally useful for cmb observations at 144 ghz because of the atmosphere .",
    "the galactic cut overlaps well with the atmospheric cut . on a day",
    "during which there are minimal atmospheric fluctuations , we end up cutting only @xmath223 of the data .",
    "when the _ rms _ chopper position over a single chop deviates by more than @xmath57 from the average position , the data are cut .",
    "this includes times when the chopper is intentionally shut off due to testing and maintenance as well as time during high winds .",

    "the files were generally started directly following a calibration or during the day when we were at the telescope , thus the percentage of these data which would otherwise be retained for cmb analysis is small .",
    "the goal of the cuts to the binned data is to ensure that only long periods of uninterrupted data are included in the final analysis .",

    "thus , on a given night , each ra bin has a single value of @xmath229 for each harmonic .",
    "these values are examined as a function of ra bin and both a slope and a mean are removed from each harmonic on each night before the nights are combined in order to reduce the potential effect of variations in the offset over long timescales .",
    "the slope subtraction has little effect on the final result ; its removal is prudent though not essential .    because the best data do not exactly overlap each night ,",
    "a potential bias occurs when the mean and slope are subtracted over different regions of sky .",
    "typical offsets for the toco98 d - band data are @xmath230k in absolute value and drift over a timescale of days .",
    "when each full night of data of one harmonic is coadded and analyzed as a function of night throughout the campaign , @xmath231 for deviation from a flat line is between one and four .",
    "the high-@xmath28 offsets are generally more stable . because we keep only large sections of contiguous data and because the offset is stable , the effect of slightly different sky coverage per evening is negligible . in the analysis , we approximate the slope and offset removal as removing a single mean and slope from the entire data set as discussed below .",
    "the chopper - position dependent offsets ( figure  [ fig : obs_offset ] ) discussed in section  [ sec - offsets ] are effectively filtered by the beam synthesis .",
    "we check this by applying the synthesis vectors to the average chopper - synchronous signal by setting @xmath232 in equation [ eq : demod ] .",

    "the results from this calculation are within 10% of the results for the full likelihood analysis @xcite . at @xmath239",
    "the noise is potentially the most problematic because the offsets are generally larger and the contribution from the atmosphere is larger than for the higher @xmath28 data . that a simple method based on average noise properties gives the same answer ( within @xmath240 ) as the full likelihood analysis , with its detailed attention to correlations and drift subtraction , gives us confidence that the noise estimates are robust and stable .",
    "there is nothing in the instrument or sky of which we are aware that changes at the temporal frequencies and spatial scales associated with @xmath241 .",
    "although the signal to noise is lower for large n - pt beams , the data are stable and insensitive to cuts .",
    "we find the most likely value of @xmath242 as a function of angular scale with a bayesian likelihood analysis of the cleaned data .",
    "the method follows the analysis of the saskatoon data though the correlation matrices are considerably simpler due to the observing strategy and the focal plane array .",
    "one feature of the likelihood analysis is that that channels and harmonics can be combined in a precise and unambiguous way to increase the signal - to - noise .",
    "an added benefit of the combined bands is that correlation between combined bands is reduced over that for a single harmonic .",
    "the likelihoods for the hemt data and sis data are shown in figure  [ fig : likelihoods ] .",
    "we test that data selection eliminates the atmospheric and instrumental contaminants without biasing the result by performing a set of internal consistency tests or null tests .",
    "data are multiplied by several different sets of synthesis vectors that have no sensitivity to the sky signal and the analysis is carried out in the same way as for the data which have been multiplied by the sky - sensitive synthesis vectors .",
    "we determine that the data have been properly selected when the set of null tests fails to show a signal for individual synthesized beams .",

    "test 1 : the minimum number of filled bins on a given day is increased from 100 ( @xmath244 hours ) to 250 ( @xmath245 hours ) and all days not common to both d1 and d2 are rejected from the analysis . the result is a decrease in the significance of the detections ( due to permitting less data in the final analysis ) but a change of less than @xmath240 for the two low-@xmath28 points and less than @xmath246 for the three high @xmath28 points .",
    "test 2 : the nominal calibration model is determined from fits to jupiter and the internal calibration pulses .",
    "instead , we perform the analysis simply using the calibration value of the closest jupiter calibration .",
    "the result is a change of less than @xmath246 , primarily due to a different calibration .",
    "test 3 : we make the harmonic dependent cut to the synthesized data more stringent . instead of cutting 45% for a typical good day as shown in table  [ tab :",
    "cuts ] , 65% is cut .",
    "the more stringent cut is most pronounced in the lower harmonics because they are most affected by atmospheric contamination .",
    "the cut results in upper limits for the @xmath247 and @xmath248 points , consistent with the decreased amount of data . above the 7-pt ,",
    "the amount of data cut and the resulting likelihoods change very little .",

    "the result is that the @xmath247 and @xmath248 points show an increase in signal of @xmath249 and @xmath250 respectively while the data points corresponding to the highest three groups of harmonics show no significant change .",
    "we have emphasized the toco98 d - band data because the points at @xmath247 and @xmath251 are more sensitive to the cuts than all the other data .",
    "this is due to the large atmospheric opacity at 144 ghz and large angular scales .",
    "the nominal cut corresponds to the best null tests and corresponds roughly to the sections of raw data one would select by eye .",

    "to quantify the foreground emission , we fit to four templates : the sfd dust map @xcite ( @xmath300 ) , the haslam synchrotron map @xcite ( @xmath301 ) , and the radio ( @xmath302 ) and iras ( @xmath303 ) source compilations from the wombat compilation ( wombat 2001 ) .",
    "we have not yet fit to the h@xmath304 maps that trace microwave free - free emission .",
    "however , we note fits to sk @xcite found that the free - free contribution was negligible .",
    "in addition , cross - correlations between the wham h@xmath305 maps @xcite and other cmb maps , including qmap , do not show a significant contribution @xcite .",
    "there is a correlation between cmb maps at frequencies @xmath306ghz and dust maps @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the correlation is not yet certain @xcite though spinning dust grains is a strong candidate @xcite .",
    "the dust - correlated foreground component is larger than the free - free component traced by h@xmath305 between 20 and 40 ghz and is not correlated to the haslam map @xcite .",
    "thus , the sfd map is a good tracer of foreground emission for the hemt data .",
    "the galactic latitude of the cmb scan covers between @xmath307 , @xmath308 and @xmath309 , @xmath310 as shown in figure  [ fig : skyscan ] .",
    "our sky scan passes near the large magellanic cloud ( lmc , @xmath311 , @xmath312 ) and we remove data near it .",
    "during the day , we observe known sources in the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "the template fitting procedure is restricted to the section of sky analyzed for cmb anisotropy .",
    "the goal is to assess the contribution to the cmb results rather than to characterize foreground emission .",
    "first , the template map is multiplied by the synthesized beam in a manner such that the full cmb observing strategy is reproduced . except in the case of the haslam map for the @xmath241 d - band data ( where no correlation is expected ) ,",
    "the size of the synthesized beam lobes is larger than the resolution of the template map .",
    "next , for each harmonic , we fit to the template with    @xmath313    where @xmath314 is the number of filled bins around the sky for the @xmath315 function ( @xmath316 , @xmath317 is the cmb temperature ( equation  [ eq : tarray ] ) , and @xmath318 is the statistical weight of each measurement .",
    "the fits are performed as a function of angular scale and frequency . where the fit result is significant , as shown in table  [ tab : foregrounds ] , we subtract the foreground component in quadrature from @xmath188 as determined from the likelihood analysis and",
    "subtract the foreground in quadrature , is sufficient because the foreground contribution to the cmb @xmath319% in all cases .",
    "future work will address the full treatment and the galactic plane . ] .",
    "the fit results may be summarized as follows : 1 ) the dominant source of contamination at 30 and 40 ghz is from the radio point sources as traced by the 4.85 ghz pmn catalog @xcite on which the wombat maps are based .",
    "the extrapolation to 30 ghz is known to be problematic because the source spectra vary from source to source @xcite .",
    "we can not rule out a contribution from sources that are not traced by the extrapolated pmn survey but , because of the measured spectrum of the peak , such a contribution can not be large . over our sky coverage @xmath320deg@xmath321",
    ", we account for @xmath322 sources .",
    "most of the contribution comes from the largest 10% and is spread throughout the observing region .",
    "2 ) contributions from synchrotron emission are negligible unless the synchrotron spectral index varies so much that the haslam map is not a good template . the largest _",
    "rms _ of the haslam map , after applying the beam synthesis , is 0.6  k. when extrapolated to 30 ghz with a spectral index of @xmath323 , one gets @xmath324k , consistent with the fitted values .",
    "the fitted dust contribution at the 30 ghz @xmath325 and 40 ghz @xmath326 points , is small but consistent with the picture of 30 ghz dust - correlated emission .",
    "3 ) there is no significant contamination at 144 ghz from either dust or point sources .",
    "table  [ tab : allresults ] gives the results from toco along with the revised results from qmap and sk based on foreground analyses and new information on the calibration .",
    "the final results for all three experiments are shown in figure  [ fig : results ] along with a comparison to recent experiments .",
    "[ tab : allresults ]",
    "since the discovery of the anisotropy @xcite , there have been many cmb anisotropy experiments at @xmath327 in addition to the ones noted thus far [ argo @xcite , msam @xcite , ucsb / sp @xcite , white dish @xcite , python @xcite , bam @xcite , iab @xcite , tenerife @xcite , max @xcite ] .",
    "the sk experiment was the first to show the rise of the cmb angular spectrum in the region between @xmath328 and @xmath329 independent of any other experiment . at the time ,",
    "the amplitude of the peak was considered high though consistent with the subsequently popular @xmath330-cdm models . until toco",
    ", the sk spectrum was in mild conflict with other experiments .    though a straightforward read of the data prior to toco suggested a peak at @xmath331 [ e.g. , sk and ovro @xcite or sk and cat @xcite ] there were lingering questions of cross calibration and point source subtraction .",
    "in fact , if one did not include the sk data , the combined analysis of ucsb / sp , argo , max , white dish , and suzie favored an open universe @xcite .",
    "dodelson and knox ( 2000 ) showed that toco alone singled out a flat universe as the best model .",
    "others @xcite , including dodelson and knox , showed that the combination of all the data singled out a flat universe .",
    "qmap was designed to measure the anisotropy by direct mapping .",
    "degree - resolution high signal - to - noise maps were made that could be compared to each other and , because they covered the same region of sky , confirmed the @xmath239 saskatoon results @xcite .",
    "the strategy of direct total power mapping was later employed by the boomerang and maxima experiments , which ushered in very high signal - to - noise sub - degree resolution mapping .",
    "the toco experiment showed both the rise and fall of the first peak and showed its spectrum was that of the cmb with a single instrument ( figure  [ fig : results ] ) .",
    "these results have since been amply verified by boomerang , maxima , and dasi .",
    "the rise to the maximum has high signal - to - noise ; the fall for @xmath241 is also clearly evident though worth quantifying .",
    "( 1999 ) reported that the 95% upper limit of the last point in d - band , @xmath332 , was just below the @xmath278 lower bound of the point of the peak , @xmath333 .",
    "the penultimate point was not included in the assessment . here",
    "we perform a more complete analysis .",
    "we focus on just the last three d - band points , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath332 , because the calibration uncertainty is common to all and drops out of the analysis .",
    "there are two ways a peak could be detected : @xmath335 , and @xmath336 but with @xmath337 .",
    "the net probability that a peak has been detected is given by the sum of the probabilities of these two possibilities .",
    "we monte carlo the likelihood distributions to determine the above probabilities and to investigate the effects of correlations .",
    "we find @xmath338 and @xmath339 .",
    "thus , the net probability that a peak has been detected is 0.99983 , or loosely speaking a @xmath340 detection .",
    "the correlations among these three points are positive and small , of order 0.01 .",
    "when the correlations are accounted for , the net effect is to increase the significance of a detection of a peak .",
    "we emphasize that the detection is model independent , calibration independent , and conservative in the sense that if there is slight contamination by point - sources or there is some undetected source of correlation , the probability of the detection _ increases .",
    "_ there are now many analyses that extract cosmological parameters assuming that the models from cmbfast @xcite describe nature , [ e.g. , @xcite ] . here",
    "we compute @xmath341 and @xmath342 directly from the data .",
    "this allows parameter estimation with the minimal amount of model dependence . from the toco and sk data ,",
    "the average amplitude of the peak between @xmath343 and @xmath344 is @xmath2k where the first error is statistical and second error is for calibration ( the @xmath345k shift from @xcite is mostly due to the new calibration ) . following knox and page ( 2000 )",
    ", we find @xmath0 in a relatively model independent parametrization.k , is sensitive to the type of fit whereas @xmath342 is relatively fit - independent .",
    "we prefer the straightforward average as it is computed directly from the data . ]",
    "the sk , qmap , and toco experiments used a variety of techniques , separate data reduction and analysis pipelines , and two different calibrators .",
    "these different experiments , rich with consistency checks , trace out a peak .",
    "we have described the systematic checks , focusing on the toco data , and have not found any instrumental effect or data reduction artifact that could mimic or produce the signal we see .",
    "it is possible that extragalactic sources with spectra different from the ones we assume could alter our results but the effect would be small and accounting for it would tend to enhance the downturn for @xmath346 . in conclusion",
    ", these experiments , in particular the toco experiment , have measured the rise , amplitude , position , and fall of the first peak in the angular spectrum of the cmb .",
    "the qmap and toco experiments took place over six years and involved many colleagues .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge conversations with and help from chuck bennett , joe fowler , lloyd knox , steve meyer , steve myers , bharat ratra , david spergel , suzanne staggs , and dave wilkinson . the toco and qmap experiments made ample use of the insights and previous efforts of norm jarosik and ed wollack . as just one example ,",
    "norm s electronics have worked flawlessly for six years .",
    "max tegmark and angelica de oliveira - costa led the science analysis of the qmap data and have had a large influence on the work presented here . the princeton machine shop time and again came up with rapid and creative solutions to our mechanical problems .",
    "operating in chile would have been considerably more difficult without the kind and frequent help of angel otrola .",
    "the cerro toco site was graciously provided by hernn quintana ; ted griffith and eugene ortiz helped in field .",
    "ray blundell and colleagues loaned us a c - band amp at a critical time .",
    "angela qualls made figures for this paper and helped the project on innumerable occasions .",
    "harvey moseley made the connection between time domain beam synthesis and fourier transform spectroscopy that we note in the paper .    neither experiment would have been possible without nrao s detector development .",
    "additionally , nrao s site monitoring was invaluable for assessing cerro toco .",
