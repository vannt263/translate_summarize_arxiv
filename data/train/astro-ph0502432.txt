    "the process of galaxy formation is almost universally acknowledged to be dependent on large - scale environment , with the regions of the universe that are most dense on large scales expected to be the sites of the earliest galaxy formation . in the present - day universe ,",
    "regions that were over - dense on @xmath13 mpc scales at high redshift have virialized to become rich galaxy clusters , harboring much more than their fair share of galaxies with the largest stellar masses and ( apparently ) the oldest luminosity - weighted stellar ages ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "measurements of galaxy clustering statistics at low ( e.g. , @xcite ) , intermediate ( e.g. , @xcite ) and high ( e.g. , @xcite ) redshift all indicate highly significant differences in clustering amplitude as a function of galaxy color and/or rest - frame optical luminosity , in the sense that redder ( older ) and more optically luminous ( larger stellar mass ) galaxies are more strongly clustered .",
    "there has been a vast literature over the past @xmath14 years focused on the properties of early type galaxies , both in clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) at low and intermediate redshifts and in the `` field '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , attempting to establish the formation epochs of these galaxies and the differences , if any , as a function of environment ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "virtually all of these studies find that early type galaxies must have formed most of their stars early ( @xmath15 ) and that they have evolved largely passively since that time .",
    "there is less agreement about the extent to which the galaxies history depends on environment , and what low or intermediate redshift results imply about the scatter in ages within clusters or the difference between clusters and lower density environments .",
    "one of the issues that undoubtedly clouds the debate is what constitutes an `` early - type '' galaxy or even a `` cluster '' .",
    "most of the galaxies studied have been selected to have the morphological appearance of early type galaxies , possibly leading to different subsets of galaxies being selected at different epochs ( called `` progenitor bias '' by @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , considerable attention has been directed to photometric and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies at high redshifts ( @xmath16 ) that are bright and/or red at rest - frame optical wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as might be expected for passively evolving galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "a general conclusion seems to be that passively evolving galaxies with large stellar masses ( @xmath17 m@xmath7 ) are present out to @xmath18 with a number density roughly similar to that observed locally .",
    "the inferred star formation histories for these galaxies imply that most of the stars formed prior to @xmath19 , in good agreement with inferences based on the evolution in the fundamental plane of cluster ellipticals to @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the number of spectroscopically identified massive galaxies in these new spectroscopic surveys is far too small to establish their large - scale context .    at present",
    ", the only spectroscopic samples of galaxies at @xmath21 that are large enough for a direct comparison of galaxy properties as a function of environment are those that are selected by color in the rest - uv ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "obviously , such samples depend on galaxies having enough current ( relatively unobscured ) star formation to be identified as a candidate for spectroscopy , which will produce a bias against both passively evolving @xmath22 galaxies and galaxies that are heavily reddened by dust ( cf .",
    "however , the rest - uv - selected surveys do turn up substantial numbers of galaxies with @xmath23 m@xmath7 whose physical properties are plausibly consistent with those observed in the rest - optically selected surveys @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued , based on their number density and clustering properties , that the galaxies present in the spectroscopic uv - selected samples at @xmath24 are likely to be the general progenitors of what would be called `` red '' galaxies at @xmath25 and `` early - type '' galaxies by @xmath26 , independent of environment .",
    "moreover , the surveys are tuned to be sensitive to star - forming galaxies during the epoch when the bulk of star formation in massive early - type cluster galaxies is inferred to have occurred . with the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ and its capability of obtaining high - quality photometry in the rest - frame near - ir at @xmath24 using the irac instrument @xcite ,",
    "it is now possible to obtain relatively reliable measures of stellar population parameters , particularly stellar masses , when combined with information available from large ground - based telescopes .    in this paper , we analyze results from a spectroscopic survey in which we have discovered a significant redshift - space over - density of galaxies at @xmath10 . while the characterization of galaxy over - densities at high redshift is being pursued using similar spectroscopic samples ( e.g. , @xcite ) and through targeted observations of likely proto - cluster regions marked by high redshift radio galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) or multiple sub - mm - selected galaxies ( @xcite ) , the combination of spectroscopic and photometric data available in the field of qso hs1700 + 643 ( notably , the availability of _ spitzer _ data ) provides an unprecedented view of the properties of both the proto - cluster galaxies and their larger - scale context at high redshift : because the selection function of our spectroscopic sample is broad and is roughly centered on the redshift of the over - density , we are able to directly compare the overall properties of similarly - selected galaxies within and outside of a structure that ( we argue ) will become a rich galaxy cluster by the present epoch . the relative insensitivity of our rest - uv selection criteria to stellar mass or star formation age offers a distinct advantage in this case : the spectroscopic sample , covering the redshift range @xmath27 ( mean and standard deviation ) in the hs1700 + 643 field , offers a relatively unbiased view of the progress of galaxy evolution within and outside of the large structure .",
    "we show , using the results of detailed modeling presented in @xcite , that there are already clear differences in the progress of galaxy evolution between the proto - cluster and `` field '' environment at @xmath28 , when the universe was 2.8 gyr old . large scale environment , and not redshift , is likely to be the primary factor determining the maturity of massive galaxies in the distant universe .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 throughout .",
    "the spectroscopic observations in the hs1700 + 643 field were obtained as part of a survey designed to simultaneously explore both star - forming galaxies at @xmath32 and the interaction between the galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in the same volumes of space .",
    "the initial results of the general @xmath18 spectroscopic survey are described by @xcite , and the full results of the sub - sample in the hs1700 field , including a description of all of the photometric observations , are presented by @xcite . because the redshift of hs1700 + 643 is @xmath33 , we used optical photometric criteria that would sample galaxies with @xmath34 , i.e. , foreground to the qso ; thus we used a combination of the `` bx '' criteria of @xcite ( @xmath35 ) and the `` md '' criteria of @xcite ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "accounting for the 4.5:1 ratio in the number of spectroscopically identified bx and md candidates to @xmath37 ( the actual ratio of photometric candidates is 6:1 to the same apparent magnitude limit ) , the expected redshift distribution for a random spectroscopic sample would be @xmath38 , based on the overall observed redshift selection functions of bx and md candidates in all survey fields .",
    "a total of 100 spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath39 has been obtained in this field to date , with the redshift distribution ( shown in figure [ fig : zhist ] ) of @xmath40 ( mean and standard deviation ) , entirely consistent with the expectations based on the overall redshift selection functions of the bx / md candidates . the distribution of observed galaxies on the plane of the sky is strongly concentrated within @xmath41 arcmin of the line of sight to hs1700 + 64 , as shown in figure [ fig : field_map ] , largely dictated by geometric constraints of the lris slitmasks used for the spectroscopic observations given our emphasis on galaxies near the qso sightline .",
    "the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts represent a very small fraction of the photometric candidates in the field , which total 1711 bx+md objects to @xmath42 over the full 15  by 15  field . within the region of the field that has also been observed in the @xmath8 band ( figure [ fig : field_map ] ) ,",
    "the fraction of candidates with spectroscopic identifications is @xmath43% ( 98/508 , of which 84 have @xmath44 and the fraction of @xmath8-detected candidates with redshifts is @xmath45% ( 92/389 , of which 79 have @xmath46 ) .",
    "because the remainder of the discussion of the galaxies in the field depends on the longer wavelength @xmath8 and irac data , hereinafter we focus only on the sample of 72 @xmath46 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts that are also detected in both @xmath8 and at least one irac band ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the redshift distribution for this sub - sample is shown in figure [ fig : zhist ] as the red histogram in the foreground .",
    "it is important to note that the galaxies were chosen for spectroscopic observation without regard to anything but position relative to the qso sightline and optical magnitudes and colors .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig : zhist ] is the redshift distribution expected for a sample of 72 galaxies drawn from a bx+md - selected sample with the observed bx / md ratio .",
    "this distribution , which is that expected in the absence of clustering , will be used to evaluate the significance of the over - density in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "all of the photometric measurements and inferred stellar population parameters for the 72 galaxies in the sample are taken directly from @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : zhist ] , there is an obvious galaxy concentration at @xmath47 in the hs1700@xmath4864 field , evident both in the subset of galaxies in the @xmath8/irac observed region of the field and in the larger optical field .",
    "we estimate the significance of the spike using the method described in steidel et al .",
    "briefly , we consider every pair of galaxies in turn , calculate the redshift difference between them and count the number of additional galaxies whose redshifts lie between the redshifts of the pair .",
    "regions where a large number of galaxies appear in a small redshift interval are identified as possible clusters .",
    "the strength of each cluster is quantified with a statistic , @xmath49 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we then focus our attention on the cluster candidate with the smallest value of @xmath49 ( i.e. , with redshifts that are most inconsistent with a random distribution ) , and calculate the significance of the cluster by analyzing numerous randomized galaxy catalogs in the same way and counting how frequently a value of @xmath49 so small ( or smaller ) appears .",
    "this approach isolates the region between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) as the most significant over - density in our data , containing 17 galaxies within the region observed with irac . over - densities with smaller values of @xmath49",
    "occurred in only 28 of 50000 randomized catalogs , so we conclude with much greater than @xmath53% confidence that this spike is inconsistent with a random distribution of galaxy redshifts .",
    "the shape of our selection function , also shown in figure  [ fig : zhist ] , implies that we should expect an average of roughly 1.9 galaxies in this redshift interval .",
    "our observed number , 17 , therefore corresponds to a galaxy over - density in redshift space of @xmath54 if we assume poisson uncertainties and neglect the two galaxies whose redshifts defined the cluster boundary ( steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "shapley et al .",
    "( 2005 ) present the full population synthesis modeling of the broad - band spectral energy distributions from rest - frame far - uv to the rest - frame near - ir for the full sample of 72 galaxies considered here , resulting in the most robust measurements of stellar population parameters to date for star - forming galaxies at @xmath55 . using these results ,",
    "we search for possible differences in the galaxy properties within and outside of the identified over - density .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass_age_z ] shows the inferred stellar masses and ages for the 72 galaxies in our sample as a function of redshift , taken from @xcite .",
    "the inferred ages of galaxies within the `` spike '' clearly stand out above the rest , with a much larger proportion of old ages compared to those outside the over - density . for constant star formation ( csf ) models ,",
    "the average galaxy age within the spike is @xmath56 myr , compared to @xmath57 myr in the `` field '' containing the `` spike '' . ] , which if taken literally implies average `` formation '' redshifts of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "a 2-sample kolmogorov - smirnov test on the csf model ages yields a probability of only @xmath60 that the age _ distributions _ are the same inside and outside of the `` spike '' . as discussed extensively in @xcite in the context of the current galaxy sample , the luminosity - weighted age is not a quantity which is well - determined from population synthesis models , particularly for star - forming galaxies when the `` current '' star formation rate is high compared to the past average .",
    "it is generally possible to make the inferred age of a galaxy significantly younger by assuming an exponentially declining star formation rate with an e - folding time @xmath61 . for the best - fit @xmath61 model applied to each galaxy in the sample ,",
    "the average galaxy ages are @xmath62 myr inside the spike and @xmath63 myr outside , and the k - s test returns a probability of @xmath64 that the age distributions are the same .",
    "thus , while the true star formation histories of the galaxies both within and outside of the over - density are almost certainly more complicated than the assumed models , and the ages of individual galaxies remain uncertain @xcite , there is a clear difference in the age - sensitive spectral signatures between the two sub - samples in the sense that proto - cluster galaxies are significantly older .",
    "the differences in age are accompanied by significant differences in stellar mass , which are much less dependent on the assumed star formation histories ( right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : mass_age_z ] ) with the bluest galaxies both the csf and @xmath61 fits imply that galaxies inside the spike have mean stellar masses roughly twice as large as those outside . a 2-sample k - s test rules out a similar stellar mass distribution at the @xmath9% level .",
    "in contrast , as we will shortly show , the _ total _ masses of galaxies inside and outside the spike should be roughly the same .",
    "we can therefore conclude that galaxies inside the spike have converted a much larger fraction of their baryons into stars than have those outside , presumably because they have had more time to do so .",
    "a naive interpretation of figure  [ fig : mass_age_z ] suggests that a typical `` field '' galaxy will reach the same level of maturity at @xmath65 that has been attained by a proto - cluster galaxy at @xmath28 .",
    "a generic expectation of popular galaxy formation models is that galaxies inside large - scale over - densities should be older than those outside , since galaxy - scale matter fluctuations inside the over - densities are sitting on a large - scale pedestal and can more easily cross the threshold @xmath66 for collapse . the theoretically expected difference in galaxy ages",
    "can be crudely estimated as follows .",
    "given the estimate @xmath67 ( adelberger et al .",
    "2004 ) for the galaxy bias in the bx sample , we use the approach of @xcite to estimate the true mass over - density @xmath68 .",
    "this quantity is related to the observed redshift - space over - density @xmath69 through the expression @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is an estimate of the effects of redshift - space distortions caused by peculiar velocities , which is itself a function of both @xmath68 and @xmath72 . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath73 mpc@xmath74 is the co - moving volume in which the measurement is being made , bounded by the 85 by 85 region on the plane of the sky and the co - moving distance , neglecting peculiar velocities , between @xmath50 and @xmath51 . a crude approximation for the volume correction factor ( see @xcite ) is given by @xmath75 where @xmath76 , which we take to be @xmath77 at @xmath78 . from these equations , one obtains @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "to evaluate the linear over - density relevant to the rest of the discussion , we use the approximation for spherical collapse from @xcite ( their equation 18 ) , which for @xmath82 gives @xmath83 as the linear matter over - density in real space of the @xmath84 spike .",
    "if we imagine , for simplicity , that star formation begins at initial virialization , the @xmath85 myr inferred age for field galaxies at @xmath86 ( for constant star formation models ; @xcite ) implies that their typical virialization redshift was @xmath87 .",
    "these galaxies therefore have a linear over - density at redshift @xmath86 of @xmath88\\delta_c \\sim 2.1",
    "the same galaxies would have linear over - densities of @xmath89 if they were within the spike .",
    "this corresponds to a virialization redshift @xmath90 for spike galaxies of @xmath91 , or @xmath92 .",
    "the implied typical age of spike galaxies would be expected to be @xmath93 myr , or roughly twice the age of field galaxies .",
    "if the typical age of field galaxies is half as large , i.e. , @xmath94 myr , the same arguments imply an age for spike galaxies of @xmath95 myr",
    ". we would therefore expect galaxies within the spike to be roughly 23 times older than those outside .",
    "as discussed above , the data support these naive expectations .",
    "our claim above that the total masses of the galaxies should be similar within and outside the over - density follows from the extended press - schechter formalism . if @xmath96 represents the press - schechter mass function in a large region with ( eulerian ) over - density @xmath68 , then @xmath96 is related to the standard press - schechter mass function @xmath97 via @xmath98 \\label{eq : mwmassfn}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation when the linear density field is smoothed on mass - scale @xmath102 ( e.g. , @xcite ; see their equations  19 and  20 ) .",
    "if we assume that the galaxies in our survey are associated with halos with dark mass @xmath103 @xcite , the expected mean halo mass inside and outside the spike differ by only @xmath104% for @xmath79 .",
    "we turn now to the question of what the spike will have become by redshift @xmath5 . evolved forward in an @xmath105 , @xmath106 cosmology",
    ", its linear over - density of @xmath107 at @xmath12 corresponds to a linear over - density of @xmath108 at @xmath109 .",
    "since this exceeds the collapse threshold @xmath66 , we expect the spike to have virialized by @xmath109 .",
    "the mass of the virialized object is easy to calculate .",
    "the approach of @xcite implies that the spike is associated with an eulerian matter over - density of @xmath4 at @xmath12 , so its mass is @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the mean co - moving matter density and @xmath112 mpc@xmath113 is approximately the volume within the observed over - density , corrected for the effects of peculiar velocities using the factor @xmath114 from above . we conclude that the spike is likely to evolve into a relatively massive cluster by @xmath5 . our observations therefore imply that at least some clusters already contained old galaxies with large stellar masses by @xmath115 , in good agreement with inferences based on studies of cluster ellipticals at zero - to - moderate redshifts .",
    "our census of galaxies within the proto - cluster is far from complete . because the spectroscopic completeness of bx / md galaxy candidates detected to @xmath116 is only @xmath45% within the @xmath117 arcmin@xmath118 region considered here , and the galaxies in the spectroscopic sample",
    "have been observed without regard to their near - ir properties , we expect that the total number of `` spike '' galaxies with properties similar to those observed and within the same solid angle is @xmath119 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the number of galaxies that are within the `` spike '' but not selected by our rest - uv color criteria ; crude estimates of the completeness with respect to all relatively massive galaxies present at @xmath55 suggest that there could be another factor of @xmath120 in galaxies that have similar masses to the ones that are selected @xcite .",
    "redshift estimates based on photometry , even when the irac bands are included , are too uncertain ( @xmath121 ) to assign galaxies to a particular structure in redshift space , and spectroscopy will be difficult or impossible for galaxies with no current star formation at @xmath28 using current - generation telescopes and instruments .",
    "it is possible that there could be a significant number of massive but quiescent red galaxies associated with the `` spike '' that would make the differences between the proto - cluster and `` field '' environments still more significant at @xmath122 .    the angular scale of the observed field was set ( rather arbitrarily ) by the size of the available field with the wirc near - ir imager and lris .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : field_map ] , the `` spike '' objects are not obviously distributed differently on the plane of the sky than the `` field '' objects  a 2-d , 2-sample k - s test gives a probability of 17% that the proto - cluster and `` field '' galaxy sky distributions are the same .",
    "there is no evidence that the observed region has included the whole structure , or even that it is roughly centered on the structure , although the angular extent of the observed field ( corresponding to a co - moving transverse scale of @xmath123 mpc at @xmath84 ) is roughly the co - moving scale expected for a proto - cluster .",
    "the current observational situation for the hs1700 + 64 @xmath84 over - density is similar to earlier observations of the @xmath124 structure in the ssa22 field @xcite , where the field size for the initial discovery was also @xmath125 and where a similar redshift - space over - density in both lbgs and lyman @xmath126 emitters was found .",
    "subsequent analysis of narrow - band lyman @xmath126 images over a much larger field by @xcite has shown that the initial ssa22 pointing was indeed the densest proto - cluster - sized sub - region within a large - scale structure extending over a @xmath127 mpc co - moving scale .    the @xmath84 structure , which ( as for the higher - redshift ssa22 example ) was discovered serendipitously within a redshift survey ,",
    "might also be compared to more `` pointed '' observations surrounding high - redshift radio galaxies .",
    "perhaps most comparable is pks 1138@xmath128262 ( @xmath129 ) , which has been studied using narrow - band lyman @xmath126 imaging and spectroscopy @xcite , narrow - band h@xmath126 imaging @xcite , and broad - band near - ir photometry @xcite .",
    "while a considerable number of objects associated with the radio galaxy have been identified , the pointed nature of the observations makes an evaluation of the significance of the numbers difficult to evaluate ; @xcite estimate the over - density of lyman @xmath126 emitters in redshift space to be somewhat smaller than that found in the ssa22 field at @xmath124 by @xcite , @xmath130 evaluated over a somewhat smaller field but a very similar redshift range .",

    ", the @xmath124 structure in ssa22 and the @xmath10 structure in the hs1700 + 643 field are the most statistically significant cluster - scale over - densities known at redshifts @xmath135 .",
    "while the implied over - densities may be somewhat larger than in the radio galaxy fields , the real difference is that identification of the structures within a controlled redshift survey provides a more direct means of measuring the redshift - space over - density and estimating the true matter over - density .",
    "these quantities require knowledge of both the mean density of objects that are being used as a `` tracer '' , and their bias with respect to matter fluctuations .",
    "the more general surveys also offer the possibility of examining galaxy properties over the full dynamic range of environment , from proto - cluster to proto - void .",
    "we have shown that the hs1700 + 643 field contains a highly significant over - density ( @xmath136 in redshift space ) of galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "a crude analysis of this structure indicates that it has a mass scale of @xmath137 mand that it will become a rich cluster of galaxies by @xmath138 .",
    "while it is not the highest redshift `` proto - cluster '' identified to date , its significance is more easily established because the redshift survey in which it was discovered provides the context necessary for estimating the associated matter over - density .",
    "the presence of the `` proto - cluster '' embedded within the redshift survey allows us to make the first direct assessment of the differences in galaxy properties as a function of environment at high redshift , using mid - ir observations from _ spitzer_/irac together with extensive ground - based data .",
    "galaxies within the proto  cluster have mean inferred stellar masses a factor of @xmath9 times higher and mean inferred ages @xmath9 times older than similarly - uv - selected galaxies in the `` field '' .",
    "this lends support to a simple theoretical picture in which the main difference between dense environments and the `` field '' is an earlier virialization time and hence a larger stellar mass fraction at a given cosmic time .",
    "the differences in inferred age between the proto - cluster and `` field '' environment , while highly significant at @xmath10 , would be relatively subtle by @xmath139 , where ( average ) age differences of @xmath140 gyr relative to ages in the range @xmath141 gyr would probably be `` in the noise '' of spectroscopic or photometric age dating for local early - type galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another complication in comparing the high redshift results with local ones is that even galaxies inhabiting environments that we call the `` field '' at @xmath10 may have descendants that find themselves in relatively dense environments ( even if they are not in clusters ) by @xmath139 ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; here it would be important to quantify the local density for `` field '' ellipticals in order to reconcile the high - redshift results with those based on the `` fossil record '' .",
    "it would require a substantial leap of faith to connect the @xmath28 galaxies with lower - redshift descendants of a particular morphology ( e.g. , `` early type galaxies '' ) ; however , the ages and stellar masses of the uv - selected denizens of the hs1700 + 643 protocluster seem consistent both with expectations based on the empirical fossil record and with the generic expectations of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "the results presented above show that , at least at @xmath55 , a significant fraction of objects destined for rich cluster environments are still forming stars , and that selection in the rest - uv , which is largely independent of past star formation @xcite , is an effective and efficient means of assembling samples of galaxies that allow quantitative assessment of the dependence of galaxy properties on environment . structures like the @xmath84 proto - cluster in the hs1700 + 643 field offer many opportunities for focused follow - up observations aimed at better understanding the physics of galaxy formation within cluster environments ; in particular , @xmath84 is a redshift at which both narrow - band lyman @xmath126 ( observed wavelength of 4012  ) and h@xmath126 ( 2.166@xmath142 m ) are easily accessible from the ground , where a combination of rest - frame optical and rest - frame far - uv spectroscopy offers a wealth of information on the kinematics , chemistry , and stellar populations of cluster galaxies in the pre - cluster environment , and where the impact of galaxy formation on the proto - intracluster medium may be measured .",
    "the results of such ongoing follow - up studies will be presented elsewhere .",
    "+ we are indebted to the irac instrument team , particularly pauline barmby , giovanni fazio , jiasheng huang , and peter eisenhardt , for obtaining and reducing the spitzer / irac data in the hs1700 + 643 field , and for allowing us early access to the data .",

    "<S> we have discovered a highly significant over - density of galaxies at @xmath0 in the course of a redshift survey designed to select star - forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 in the field of the bright @xmath2 qso hs1700 + 643 . </S>",
    "<S> the structure has a redshift - space galaxy over - density of @xmath3 and an estimated matter over - density in real space of @xmath4 , indicating that it will virialize by @xmath5 with a mass scale of @xmath6 m@xmath7 , that of a rich galaxy cluster . </S>",
    "<S> detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution from the rest - far - uv to the rest - near - ir  of the 72 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in this field for which we have obtained @xmath8 and _ spitzer_/irac photometry , allows for a first direct comparison of galaxy properties as a function of large - scale environment at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we find that galaxies in the proto - cluster environment have mean stellar masses and inferred ages that are @xmath9 times larger ( at @xmath10 ) than identically uv - selected galaxies outside of the structure , and show that this is consistent with simple theoretical expectations for the acceleration of structure formation in a region that is over - dense on large scales by the observed amount . </S>",
    "<S> the proto - cluster environment contains a significant number of galaxies that already appear old , with large stellar masses ( @xmath11 m@xmath7 ) , by @xmath12 . </S>"
