    "a large class of conjugated @xmath1electron systems , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) are of fundamental importance in many research areas of chemistry as well as in materials science and astrophysics .",
    "pahs are precursors of extented carbon networks @xcite and their carbon skeletons can be seen as small pieces of graphene @xcite .",
    "some pahs are of interest in environmental chemistry due to their carcinogenicity and their ubiquity as air pollutants produced by the combustion of organic matter @xcite .",
    "neutral and charged pahs up to large sizes are thought to be abundant in space and are thus seen as an intermediate stage between the gas and dust phases of the matter between stars @xcite .",
    "homologous classes of pahs in their crystalline state are among the most promising materials for organic electronics @xcite .",
    "oligoacenes and their derivatives , for example , are being increasingly used as active elements in a variety of optoelectronic devices such as organic thinfilm fieldeffect transistors @xcite , lightemitting diodes @xcite , photovoltaic cells @xcite , and liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "organic electronics based on functionalized acenes and heteroacenes is presently a very active field of research @xcite .",
    "the main features controlling organic semiconducting devices are exciton formation , migration , and dissociation , charge transport , charge collection at the electrodes , molecular packing in the bulk material , and absorption and emission properties @xcite .",
    "since many of these properties pertain mostly to the molecular units , systematic quantumchemical calculations on isolated pahs can significantly contribute to our understanding of the electronic and optical properties of families with promising optoelectronic applications .    as a part of a more extensive research on pahs @xcite , and following our previous work on oligoacenes @xcite",
    ", we present in this paper a comprehensive comparative theoretical study of four homologous classes of pahs , namely oligoacenes , phenacenes , circumacenes , and oligorylenes , in their neutral , cationic , and anionic chargestates .",
    "this choice of families was motivated by the availability of reliable experimental data for the first members of each class .",
    "they include both catacondensed ( oligoacenes and phenacenes ) and pericondensed ( circumacenes and oligorylenes ) species , spanning a representative range of regular , relatively symmetric pahs .",
    "moreover circumacenes and oligorylenes converge , at the infinite limit , to a zigzag and armchair edged graphene nanoribbon , respectively , and as such are promising candidates for organic and molecular electronics @xcite .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the first five members of each class .",
    "the geometries of the molecules considered are sketched in fig .",
    "[ molecules ] .",
    "oligoacenes @xcite and phenacenes @xcite consist of fused benzene rings joined in a linear and zigzag arrangement , respectively .",
    "oligorylenes @xcite can be seen as a series of naphthalene molecules connected by two carboncarbon bonds , and circumacenes are obtained by addition of benzene units around the circumference of their oligoacenes counterparts .",

    "the knowledge of this property , in particular , enabled a comparison of the absorption in the visible part of the spectrum , a quantity of interest for photovoltaic applications .",
    "moreover , we used totalenergy differences between the selfconsistent field calculations performed for the neutral and charged systems ( @xmath0 ) to evaluate : ( i ) the vertical and adiabatic electron affinities and first ionization energies ; ( ii ) the quasiparticle correction to the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo)lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) gap ; ( iii ) the molecular reorganization energies .",
    "the comparison between the optical gap , i.e. the lowest singletsinglet tddft excitation energy , and the quasiparticle corrected homolumo gap enabled a rough estimate of the excitonic effects occurring in these molecules .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we used the gaussianbased dft module of the nwchem package @xcite to compute the groundstate properties of each molecule in its @xmath2 chargestate . following our previous studies on linear acenes @xcite",
    ", we used a basisset with the smallest addition of diffuse functions , namely the basis , a valence double zeta set augmented with @xmath3 polarization functions and @xmath4 and @xmath5 diffuse functions for each carbon atom .",
    "geometry optimizations were performed using tight convergence criteria , specified by maximum and root mean square gradient thresholds of 1.5@xmath610@xmath7 and 1.0@xmath610@xmath7 atomic units , respectively , and maximum and root mean square thresholds of the cartesian step respectively of 6.0@xmath610@xmath7 and 4.0@xmath610@xmath7 atomic units .",
    "all neutral and singlycharged species were computed as singlet and doublet , respectively , which are known to be the ground states for this class of molecules @xcite .",
    "geometry optimization were performed using the hybrid b3lyp functional , a combination of the becke s three parameter exchange functional @xcite and the lee yangparr gradientcorrected correlation functional @xcite . in comparison with other exchangecorrelation functionals ,",
    "the b3lyp has proven to give results markedly more accurate for the groundstate properties of pahs @xcite and has been used in a large number of studies @xcite .",
    "although the b3lyp functional has been developed for the electronic groundstate , it is also routinely employed to obtain electronic excitedstate properties , and its application usually yields accurate results for lowlying valenceexcited states of both closedshell @xcite and openshell @xcite species .",
    "it is known , however , that this functional show the wrong asymptotic behaviour , decaying faster than @xmath8 ( i.e. , exponentially ) for large distances @xmath9 from the nuclei . among the well known and documented limitations of conventional functionals",
    "@xcite are : ( i ) the correct description of rydberg @xcite , doublyexcited @xcite , and chargetransfer @xcite excitedstates , ( ii ) the failure for large , extended @xmath1systems such as polyacetylene fragments and oligoporphyrins @xcite , and ( iii ) the systemsizedependent errors found for the lowest shortpolarized excited states of neutral oligoacenes @xcite .    this latter error in particular , which is particularly relevant to the present study ,",
    "was recently shown to be corrected by rangeseparated functionals @xcite . while conventional hybrid functional such as b3lyp",
    "are defined with a costant fraction of hartreefock exchange , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used rangeseparated functionals @xcite incorporating both a positiondependent fraction and an asymptotically correct contribution of hartreefock exchange .",
    "the application of rangeseparated functionals to organic compounds show that they provide , in general , a better accuracy than global hybrids @xcite .    as to the molecular properties of interest in this work ( electron affinities , ionization energies , quasiparticle corrected homolumo gaps , exciton binding energy , electronic excitations )",
    ", we recently checked for oligoacenes both the sensitivity of our calculations to different exchangecorrelation functionals @xcite , and their reliability in comparison with the available experimental data . with the only exception of the ionization energy , which were found to be described better at the lda level",
    ", we found that the hybrid b3lyp functional yields the overall best performance .    to further asses this choice we performed some benchmark calculations using the range separated functional lcblyp @xcite , which was found to give the best results in describing the optoelectronic properties of oligoacenes @xcite .",
    "table  [ test1 ] reports the comparison between b3lyp , lcblyp , and the available experimental data of oligoacenes .",
    "a similar comparison for some selected properties for which we could find the corresponding experimental data is presented in table  [ test2 ] for the smallest species of the four pah families considered , namely naphthalene , phenanthrene , coronene , and perylene .",
    "the results in table  [ test1 ] are consistent with those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the small differences being due to the larger basis set cc - pvtz used in the latter work . as shown by the reported mean absolute errors ( mae ) and root - mean - squared errors ( rms ) , the use of lcblyp is indeed ( i ) able to solve the systemsizedependent errors of b3lyp found for the lowest excited state corresponding to the homolumo transition ( @xmath5 bands ) ; ( ii )",
    "gives ionization energies that are in much more agreement than b3lyp with experiments ; and ( iii ) provides better quasiparticle corrected homo - lumo gaps . at the same time",
    ", however , the b3lyp functional appears to outperform lcblyp with respect to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 bands , the electron affinity , and the exciton binding energy ; the molecular reorganization energies are described with the same accuracy by the two methods . when considering different families as done in table  [ test2 ] , the b3lyp results are always in better agreement with experiments , with the only exception of the ionization energy .",
    "since definitive conclusions can not be drawn from our benchmark calculations and a thorough comparison between the performances of global hybrids and range separated functionals is beyond the scope of this work ,    we decided to extend our previous analyses for oligoacenes @xcite , using the same level of theory b3lyp/ for the other classes of pahs considered in this work .    .",

    "however , the use of a finite simulation box in our simulations does not give a satisfactory treatment of continuum effects in this spectral window and produces spurious structures as compared to experiments @xcite .",
    "the main differences among families arise in the lowenergy part of the spectrum , from the nearir to the nearuv up to about 8  ev , which involves electronic transitions of @xmath23 character .",
    "this is also the spectral window which is more interesting from an applicative point of view . in particular ,",
    "an inspection of fig .",
    "[ spectra ] shows that each family displays a continuous redshift of the absorption at increasing sizes .",
    "this behaviour was expected as a consequence of the continuous decrease in bandgap already observed for each class ( see fig .",
    "[ trends ] ) . as to the charged species , as shown in figs .",
    "[ spectra+][spectra- ] we found that pah radical cations and anions display intense optical transitions at lower energies than their parent molecule , and have very similar electronic spectra .",
    "these findings , already known for charged pahs from extensive spectroscopic studies in frozen glassy organic solids @xcite , are in qualitative agreement with the particlehole equivalence in the pairing theorem of hckel s theory .",
    "the behaviour described above at low energies translates for each molecule in each class into a systematic increase of the integrated strengthfunction in the range 1.03.0  ev when going from the neutral to the cation and anion ( see fig .",
    "[ integrated ] ) .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for oligoacenes and phenacenes and , as expected , the observed scatter between the different chargestates decreases with increasing molecular size .",
    "interestingly , oligorylenes appear to be much more efficient in absorbing lowenergy photons in comparison to the other classes ; as an example , focusing on the neutral species with the same number of carbon atoms , the value of s(e)/n@xmath24 for quaterrylene exceeds by more than 80% the corresponding value for circumanthracene .",

    "we presented a systematic theoretical study of the five smallest species of oligoacenes , phenacenes , circumacenes , and oligorylenes in their -1 , 0 , and + 1 chargestates . from the groundstate structural relaxations performed at the level we computed the electron affinities , the first ionization energies , the molecular reorganization energies , and the quasiparticle correction to the homolumo energy gap .",
    "we found good agreement with the available experimental data as well as with previous theoretical results .",
    "benchmark calculations performed using the rangeseparated functional lcblyp suggest that the agreement with the experiment can be further improved for some selected properties ( e.  g. the ionization energy ) ; a systematic study will be the subject of future work . concerning transport properties , circumacenes appear to have the most favorable properties for technological applications , displaying a steeper decrease of the molecular reorganization energy as the molecular size increases .",
