    "the ions in the solar atmosphere are illuminated by a broadband radiation field that pumps the atomic levels through all possible transitions simultaneously , creating many different scattering channels .",
    "these conditions are responsible for the appearance of complex coherence phenomena , where the scattered polarization signatures become coupled with the atomic polarization of the various energy levels involved in the atomic transitions .",
    "the expression that was presented in paper  i for the two - term atom is general enough that it lends itself to a straightforward extension to the treatment of more complex atomic structures .",
    "here we generalize such expression to the description of polarized radiation effects in a @xmath0-type multi - term atom , where the lower terms of the system are all radiatively coupled to a common excited state ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",

    "our model is restricted to the case where all @xmath4 levels are sharp ( i.e. , with practically infinite lifetime ) .",
    "[ fig : model ] ]    an important example of such @xmath0-type system is contained in the ion , and underlies the formation of some notable transitions observed in the solar spectrum : the h and k lines around 395 nm , which display a complex polarization pattern spanning more than 10 nm @xcite , due to coherent scattering and quantum interference between the levels of the upper @xmath7 term of the doublet @xcite ; and the infrared ( ir ) triplet around 858 nm , in particular the 854.2 nm and 866.2 nm lines , which under solar conditions is dominated by the presence of atomic polarization in the metastable @xmath8 term @xcite .",
    "the uv doublet and the ir triplet are connected via the common @xmath7 upper term , yet previous attemps at modeling the formation of these sets of lines have not taken into account the full complexity of this system : either coherent scattering in a multi - level system was considered , but the essential polarization of the metastable @xmath8 levels was neglected @xcite , or the atomic polarization of all the levels was included in the modeling of the ir triplet pattern , but coherence effects among the levels of the upper @xmath7 term were neglected @xcite .    in the next section , we provide explicit expressions for the @xmath0-type multi - term atom with and without hyperfine structure , as well as for the multi - level atom , when the fine - structure interaction is completely neglected",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec : application ] we present the application of this formalism to the modeling of the polarized line profiles of some notable @xmath0-type atomic systems .",
    "we consider the general form of the radiative transfer equation for polarized light in spectral lines , including the process of coherent scattering in a spectral line , which is responsible for the effects of partial redistribution of the radiation frequency when the illumination of the atom is not spectrally flat .",
    "such transfer equation was presented in @xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) , and when the polarized radiation is expressed in terms of the stokes vector @xmath9 , it takes the form @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the absorption matrix ( corrected for radiation stimulated effects ) , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the source terms due to the spontaneous emission of radiation from the excited levels , and to coherent scattering in the spectral line , respectively .    in the particular case of sharp lower levels , and in the absence of collisions , there is no true excitation of the upper levels , because of the infinite radiative lifetime of the lower levels .",
    "then , the emissivity due to the spontaneous emission term @xmath12 in the transfer equation can be neglected , as well as stimulation effects of the radiation ( see paper i ) . in this case , the absorption term does not originate from true photon absorption , but corresponds instead to the atom s cross - section for the coherent scattering of radiation .    accordingly , in this work we consider the scattering of radiation in resonance lines when both the initial and final states of the transition are infinitely sharp . then the only _ positive _ contribution to the line radiation comes from the coherent scattering term @xmath13 .",
    "this is given by equation  ( i.20 ) , @xmath14 here , @xmath15 represents the matrix element between the atomic states @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the @xmath18 spherical component of the electric dipole moment , @xmath19 . the geometric tensors @xmath20 were introduced by @xcite , and their algebraic expressions have been tabulated by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we also introduced the redistribution function in the atomic frame of reference , @xmath73 the transformation of equation  ( [ eq : rt.jf ] ) to the laboratory frame of reference is formally attained by replacing the redistribution function of equation  ( [ eq : redist ] ) with the appropriate velocity - dependent function @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the frequencies of the incoming and outgoing radiation in the laboratory frame , respectively , and @xmath77 is the scattering angle .",
    "the task of extending the redistribution function in the laboratory frame to the case of a @xmath0-type three - term polarized atom has been undertaken in a separate work ( r.  casini & r.  manso sainz 2016 ; in preparation ) . in the appendix , we give the form of such redistribution function in the limit case of _ non - coherent lower term _ , which applies practically to all the examples presented in section  [ sec : application ] .",
    "it is important to note that the widths of the level @xmath78 and @xmath79 appearing in the redistribution profiles of the form @xmath80 must take into account all possible spontaneous de - excitation processes towards lower terms @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 where , according to our model , the set of lower terms @xmath81 also includes the final term @xmath6 .    for some applications , including those presented in the next section , it is necessary to consider atomic models without hyperfine structure , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "in that case , after some straightforward racah algebra manipulations of equation  ( [ eq : rt.jf ] ) , we find @xmath84 finally , in the case of the multi - level atom , there is no dependence of the line profiles on the @xmath65-indices , and so we can use the orthogonality properties of the hamiltonian eigenvectors ( see equations  ( i.23 ) ) in order to perform the trivial summations over those indices .",

    "the model is for the 90-degree scattering of a collimated beam of radiation by a plasma with temperature @xmath89k , and no magnetic field .",
    "the intensity of the incident radiation field corresponds to a planckian spectrum at @xmath90k .",
    "the incident uv radiation ( monochromatic and unpolarized ) is nearly resonant with the ly@xmath1 transition , with a detuning of @xmath91  ( vertical dashed lines in the top panels ) .",
    "we note the presence of a secondary contribution in the scattered radiation , which is perfectly resonant with the natural wavelength of the line .",
    "the intensity profile amplitude is expressed as number of scattered photons per unit intervals of time , emitting volume , wavelength , and solid angle , assuming a reference gas density @xmath92 for the emitting volume . ]",
    "as an application of equation  ( [ eq : rt.j ] ) , we first consider the simplest case of the @xmath0-type system @xmath93-@xmath94-@xmath95 of , which pertains to the formation of the ly@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , respectively at 102.5 nm and 656.3 nm .",
    "since both lines formed in this restricted @xmath0-type system have sharp lower levels , the corresponding three - term model atom can indeed be described through the formalism presented above .",
    "more specifically , we model the effect of detuning of the uv radiation around the wavelength of the ly@xmath1 line on the intensity and polarization of the h@xmath2 line . for this purpose , we assume an ensemble of atoms with a pre - assigned distribution of population and atomic polarization in the ground and metastable states . this distribution is derived by solving the statistical equilibrium for the atomic system under prescribed illumination conditions , corresponding to a collimated beam of highly diluted radiation with a planckian spectrum at @xmath96 . under such conditions , the population of the excited @xmath97 term is negligible with respect to the populations of the ground and metastable states ( by about 9 and 8 orders of magnitude , respectively ) , and the prd formalism presented in this work , where the incoherent emission of photons from spontaneous de - excitation of the upper term can be neglected , thus becomes applicable .",

    "the scattering configuration is the same as for figure  [ fig : lyb - ha ] , but for an incident radiation with a planckian spectrum at @xmath100k . the diagonal dash - dotted line in the left panel tracks the location of the monochromatic illumination with respect to the intensity profile of the scattered 854.2 nm line , for the various values of detuning .",

    "figure  [ fig : lyb - ha ] shows the scattered radiation produced in this system .",
    "the wavelength of the uv incident radiation , which again is monochromatic and unpolarized , is marked by the vertical dashed lines in the stokes @xmath64 and @xmath88 plots of the ly@xmath1 line . in order to clearly identify the various contributions to the scattered radiation in the system , we assume no incident radiation at the h@xmath2 wavelength .",
    "hence , the radiation scattered in the spectral range of h@xmath2 is completely due to raman scattering through virtual excitation of the @xmath97 term by the uv radiation .",
    "we note that the scattered radiation in the ly@xmath1 line is dominated by the coherent component centered around the wavelength of the monochromatic uv incident radiation .",
    "however , because of the relatively large doppler width compared to the size of the detuning , a small contribution , resonant with the natural transition of the line and blended with the coherent component , is also present in this case .",
    "in contrast , the emission in h@xmath2 shows these same two contributions well separated .",
    "in fact , if we indicate with @xmath101 the detuning of the incident radiation in the @xmath0-type system , for the final branch of the scattering process @xmath102 because in figure  [ fig : lyb - ha ] the detuning from the ly@xmath1 resonance is @xmath103 , the coherent component in h@xmath2 occurs with a wavelength shift from resonance given by @xmath104 . as this is larger than the doppler width corresponding to the assumed plasma temperature ( which instead scales linearly with the wavelength of the transition ) ,",
    "the coherent and resonant contributions in the h@xmath2 line appear completely separated .",
    "we also note that the line profiles of both transitions are 100% linearly polarized at the frequency of coherent re - emission , as it is to be expected in the wings of @xmath105-@xmath106 transitions . finally , we point out that the wavelength integrated intensity profiles of figure  [ fig : lyb - ha ] , which give the total numbers of photons emitted in the ly@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , are in exactly the same ratio as the einstein a - coefficients of the two transitions , which is also to be expected .",
    "next , we consider the more complex atomic system of , leading to the formation of the h and k lines around 395 nm and the ir triplet around 858 nm .",
    "we model the effect of detuning in the two cases where the monochromatic incident radiation is located in the proximity of either one or the other of the two transitions .",
    "we consider the same scattering configuration as in the previous example , with the exception of the temperature of the incident radiation , for which we assume instead a planckian spectrum at @xmath107 .",
    "stokes @xmath64 and @xmath88 emission profiles of the ir 854.2 nm line ( top panels ) and the k line at 393.4 nm ( bottom panels ) of , for the same scattering model adopted for figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] .",
    "these profiles correspond to the detuning of the incident radiation from the 854.2 nm wavelength resonance identified by the horizontal dashed lines in the contour plots of figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] .",
    "hence , the stokes @xmath64 profiles represent the horizontal cut of those contour plots for the corresponding value of the detuning of the incident ir radiation .",
    "the profiles shown with dashed curves correspond to the case when the atomic polarization of the metastable state of the system is neglected . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] shows contour plots of the scattered stokes @xmath64 emission profiles ( wavelength along the @xmath98 axis ) of the ir line at 854.2 nm ( left ) and the k line at 393.4 nm ( right ) of , as a function of the frequency of a monochromatic illumination ( wavelength along the @xmath99 axis ) varying within a spectral range of 0.18   around the 854.2 nm resonance wavelength .",
    "each horizontal slice of those plots thus corresponds to the scattered line intensity profile for the corresponding value of the detuning from the 854.2 nm resonance .",
    "again , we assume no direct illumination of the k line for this modeling , and so the emitted radiation in that line is purely produced by raman scattering induced via virtual excitation of the upper state of the k line by the ir illumination .",
    "in particular , this allows us to represent the scattered radiation in both lines via the contour plots of figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] , as a function of only one detuning parameter .",
    "the observed spectral spread of the re - emitted radiation along the @xmath98 axis is produced by doppler redistribution , corresponding to the plasma temperature of 1000k .",
    "also for this model we assumed a zero magnetic field . in such case",
    ", the wavelength dependence of the stokes @xmath88 polarization qualitatively resembles closely that of the intensity profiles ( see also figure  [ fig : plots.offres.8542 ] , and therefore we omitted showing contour plots also of stokes @xmath88 .     same as figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] , but for an inverted role of the two transitions , where the monochromatic incident radiation this time is tuned across the spectral range of the k line centered at 393.4 nm , with no radiation directly exciting the ir line at 854.2 nm .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines locate the value of the detuning of the monochromatic uv incident radiation adopted for the calculation of the emission profiles shown in figure  [ fig : plots.offres.k ] . ]",
    "the dash - dotted diagonal line in the left plot tracks the wavelength of the monochromatic ir incident radiation as it scans across the spectral interval around the 854.2 nm resonance wavelength .",
    "as the detuning from the 854.2 nm transition ( which is read on the @xmath99 axis ) decreases in absolute value , the signal of the scattered radiation remains initially fully coherent with the frequency of the incident radiation , while at the same time it increases in strength .",
    "in fact , for values of the detuning larger than @xmath108   in absolute value , the virtual energy levels of the upper term attained during the scattering process lie outside the energy band corresponding to the thermal line width of the upper term .",
    "then there is no energy overlap leading to quantum interference between these levels and the atomic hamiltonian eigen - levels of the upper term , and the scattering is purely coherent in both the k and 854.2 nm lines .",
    "this process corresponds to rayleigh scattering of the monochromatic incident radiation , and the frequency spread observed in the scattered radiation is dominated by the doppler redistribution corresponding to the plasma temperature .",
    "however , at about 0.06  from resonance , the signal of the non - coherent contribution at the resonance wavelength of the 854.2 nm line begins to appear , becoming the dominant term of the scattered radiation in an interval of about @xmath109  around the resonance .",
    "the radiation emitted in the k line , which is produced by raman scattering towards the ground state , is also dominated by the resonant contribution at 393.4 nm approximately within the same interval of detuning of the ir illumination , although the profiles of this line never become double - peaked .",
    "this can be understood if we recall equation  ( [ eq : important ] ) , and it is clearly illustrated by figure  [ fig : plots.offres.8542 ] , which shows the stokes @xmath64 and @xmath88 emission profiles ( solid curves ) for a detuning of @xmath110  from the 854.2 nm resonance wavelength ( horizontal slice of the contour plots of figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] identified by the dashed lines ) .",
    "overplotted on these profiles , with the dashed curves , we show the same case where the contribution of the atomic polarization in the metastable state of is neglected . as we see from comparing the two sets of profiles , the linear polarization of the scattered radiation in both k and 854.2 nm lines is larger in that case .",
    "stokes @xmath64 and @xmath88 emission profiles of the k line at 393.4 nm ( top panels ) and the ir 854.2 nm line ( bottom panels ) of , for the same scattering model adopted for figure  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] , but in the case where the monochromatic incident radiation is tuned around the k line resonance wavelength .",
    "we note how in this case the profiles of both lines can become visibly double - peaked , as a consequence of equation  ( [ eq : important ] ) .",
    "these profiles correspond to the cut of the contour plots of figure  [ fig : plots.res.k ] for the value of the detuning of the monochromatic uv incident radiation identified by the horizontal dashed lines . ]",
    "stokes emission profiles of the k line , with the same detuning of the uv radiation around the k line resonance as for figure  [ fig : plots.offres.k ] , but in the case where a magnetic field with @xmath111 g directed towards the observer is also present .",
    "we note the manifestation of the hanle effect polarization in both stokes @xmath88 and @xmath112 , in the resonant core of the line .",
    "the dashed curve in the panel for stokes @xmath113 represents the weak - field approximation to the circular polarization signal , computed through the first derivative of stokes @xmath64 , assuming the @xmath114-coupling value for the effective land factor of the line , @xmath115 . ]    figures  [ fig : plots.res.k ] and [ fig : plots.offres.k ] are analogous to figures  [ fig : plots.res.8542 ] and [ fig : plots.offres.8542 ] , for the case where the monochromatic incident radiation is tuned across the resonance wavelength of the k line at 393.4 nm instead , with no radiation directly exciting the ir transition at 854.2 nm .",
    "as evidenced by figure  [ fig : plots.offres.k ] , in this case the profiles of both lines can become double - peaked ( for values of the detuning from resonance larger than @xmath116  in absolute value ) , in virtue of the separation between the coherent and resonant contributions satisfying equation  ( [ eq : important ] ) .    when a magnetic field is present",
    ", the profiles evidently become more complicated , although some general conclusions can be drawn from the example presented in figure  [ fig : plots.b ] .",
    "this shows the full stokes profiles of the ir line at 854.2 nm under the same illumination conditions of figure  [ fig : plots.offres.k ] , but with the addition of a magnetic field of 5 g directed towards the observer ( i.e. , normal to the direction of the incident radiation ) . because the magnetic field strength is comparable to the hanle critical field for the upper level @xmath117 of the 854.2 nm and k lines ( @xmath118",
    "g , where @xmath119 is the land factor of the @xmath117 level , and @xmath120 is calculated via equation  ( [ eq : widths ] ) ) , one expects that the stokes profiles will show evidence of hanle - effect depolarization . indeed , comparing the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : plots.offres.k ] with the top panels of figure  [ fig : plots.b ] , we see that the intensity profile is practically unaffected by the presence of a weak magnetic field , whereas the resonant component of stokes @xmath88 shows a depolarization with respect to the zero - field case , and accordingly a signal in stokes @xmath112 appears .",
    "it is important to observe that the stokes @xmath112 signal manifests itself strictly in the resonant core of the line , which is also where the depolarization of stokes @xmath88 occurs .",
    "this is to be expected , since the hanle effect is a manifestation of the relaxation of atomic coherence as the energy degeneracy of the atomic hamiltonian eigen - levels is lifted by the applied magnetic field .",
    "stokes profiles of the line at 854.2 nm , for the same scattering configuration and magnetic model of figure  [ fig : plots.b ] , and different conditions of polarization of the monochromatic uv incident radiation in the proximity of the k line : unpolarized ( solid curves ; identical to the case of figure  [ fig : plots.b ] ) ; fully linearly polarized along the los ( dashed curves ) ; fully linearly polarized perpendicularly to the los ( dash - dotted curves ) . ]",
    "we also note that the shape of stokes @xmath113 is not quite reproduced by the weak - field approximation of the circular polarization signal ( dashed curve in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : plots.b ] ) , despite the very small strength of the applied field , and the fact that all polarization effects due to level interference induced by the magnetic field , such as stokes-@xmath113 asymmetries associated with atomic orientation , are completely negligible in this case , because of the relatively large fine structure separation between the @xmath121 levels of the upper term .",
    "therefore , the net circular polarization observed in figure  [ fig : plots.b ] is a manifestation of the effects of partial redistribution on the circular polarization of the scattered light .",
    "all previous examples were calculated assuming an unpolarized beam of incident radiation .",
    "figure  [ fig : ca_8542.b+q ] shows instead the stokes profiles of the 854.2 nm line for the same scattering configuration and magnetic model as in the example of figure  [ fig : plots.b ] , but under different conditions of polarization of the incident uv radiation .",
    "more precisely , the atomic system is still prepared assuming the same flat and unpolarized radiation field as in all previous examples , and only the incident beam of radiation used in equation  ( [ eq : rt.j ] ) is now assumed to be linearly polarized .",
    "the solid curves represent the case of unpolarized incident radiation as a reference , which are identical to those shown in figure  [ fig : plots.b ] .",
    "the other curves represent instead the cases of fully linearly polarized radiation with @xmath122 ( polarization along the los ; dashed curves ) and @xmath123 ( polarization perpendicular to the los ; dash - dotted curves ) .",
    "when the incident beam of radiation is linearly polarized along the los , the linear polarization of the scattered radiation is practically completely suppressed ( in fact , by approximately six orders of magnitude compared to the unpolarized case ) , as it can be expected also on the basis of simple classical arguments @xcite . as a concluding remark",
    ", we want to point out that , while the atomic polarization produced by the anisotropy of the incident radiation is fully accounted for in the modeling examples presented in this work , all those examples are realized under physical conditions where the atomic coherence in the lower terms is practically negligible .",
    "this is either because the magnetic field is absent ( figures  [ fig : lyb - ha ] to [ fig : plots.offres.k ] ) , or because the magnetic strength is above the critical value for the hanle effect of the lower term ( figures  [ fig : plots.b ] and [ fig : ca_8542.b+q ] ) , yet small enough not to induce any @xmath66-@xmath124 level interference via the paschen - back effect .",
    "the realization of this range of physical conditions allows us to adopt a reduced form of the redistribution function for the polarized atom introduced in @xcite ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to a direct generalization to the three - term atom of the @xmath125 function adopted elsewhere in the prd literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
