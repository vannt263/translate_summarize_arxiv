    "the interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments requires the determination of the neutrino energy which enters the expression of the oscillation length .",
    "this determination is often done through `` quasielastic events '' and the reconstructed energy hypothesis in which the neutrino interaction in the nuclear target with lepton production is supposed to take place on a nucleon at rest . in this case",
    "the only measurement of the lepton variables , its energy and emission angle , allows the reconstruction of the neutrino energy . in cherenkov detectors",
    "`` quasielastic events '' are defined as those in which the emission product only include one lepton , the ejected nucleons being unobservable for these types of detectors . in this case",
    "the definition of quasielastic events incorporates multinucleon ones which are indistinguishable from the genuine quasielastic ones .",
    "we have suggested @xcite that the miniboone axial mass anomaly @xcite in the quasielastic cross section could be accounted for by the inclusion of the multinucleon channel and we have been able to reproduce @xcite the total `` quasielastic '' cross section as well as the measured double differential cross section without any modification of the axial mass . in a more recent work @xcite we have addressed the question of the energy reconstruction , taking into account the fact that not all events being real quasielastic ones , the usual reconstruction method becomes questionable .",
    "we have explored , for charged current neutrino reactions , the corrections to this method in the form of a probability distribution , @xmath1 , to have a real energy @xmath2 starting from a reconstructed value @xmath3 .",
    "we have shown that this distribution can be expressed in terms of the double differential neutrino nucleus cross section with respect to the energy @xmath4 transferred to the nucleus and the lepton emission angle @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the distribution also involves the neutrino flux distribution @xmath7 .",
    "similar approaches taking as well into account the multinucleon contribution have followed @xcite .",
    "the double differential cross section @xmath8 for muon production has been measured by miniboone @xcite .",
    "although the ponderations by the neutrino flux do not allow a direct insertion of this experimental data to derive the energy distributions , the fact that our theoretical model is able to account in a satisfactory way for the miniboone data of this double differential cross section @xcite allows a certain degree of confidence in the distributions that we have obtained .",
    "the most spectacular influence of the multinucleon component in the distribution is the existence of a tail in the neutrino energy region above the reconstructed energy . with the evaluation of these probability distributions",
    "we could transform the experimental distributions such as those given by miniboone @xcite or t2k @xcite , in terms of reconstructed neutrino energies , to smeared ones expressed in terms of the true energies which may then be confronted to oscillation models .",
    "we have applied @xcite the smearing procedure to the oscillation electron events issued from the oscillation of a muon neutrino beam in the case of the t2k experiment where electrons from the interaction of electron neutrinos attributed to an oscillation process of a muon neutrino beam have been observed and their distribution in terms of the reconstructed energy given @xcite . here",
    "the disappearance effect is well established and the oscillation parameters known to a good accuracy . hence the electron neutrino energy distribution which enters the smearing function is predictable from the muon neutrino one .",
    "we have applied our smearing procedure to extract the distribution in terms of the real neutrino energy . after this procedure",
    "the shape of the distribution could be successfully compared with the expected theoretical predicted shape , product of our total quasielastic cross section with the electron neutrino distribution generated by the oscillation of muon neutrinos .",
    "this consistency confirms the validity of the assumptions made : the observed electron events do come from an oscillation phenomenon and the oscillation mass parameter has the right magnitude .",
    "the second case is the miniboone one where excess electron events attributed to the oscillation of the muon beam have also been observed @xcite . here one deals with a short baseline experiments , @xmath9 m , and the grounds for describing these oscillations are not as established .",
    "short baseline oscillation phenomena , if they exist , involve sterile neutrinos with large values of the @xmath10 , in the ev@xmath11 range . but",
    "this value , hence the electron neutrinos energy distribution , is uncertain . we remind that our smearing procedure depends on this distribution . assuming as an example that it followed the muon neutrino one we have applied the smearing procedure to the experimental miniboone distribution .",
    "the data present a low energy anomaly with an excess of low reconstructed energy electron events .",
    "after our smearing procedure the excess of low energy electron neutrino events which raises a problem in the oscillation models , is pushed towards higher energy , making it possibly compatible with oscillation models .",
    "of course this conclusion was not reliable as the assumption made on the electron neutrino spectrum was not based on oscillation models and therefore totally arbitrary . indeed in this case",
    "we observe that , contrary to the t2k case , there is no consistency at all between the smeared experimental distribution and the theoretical one , product of the total charged current `` quasielastic '' cross section for electron neutrino by their energy distribution , @xmath12 , the theoretical one extending much further in energy .",
    "this is not a surprise since the flux model was totally arbitrary .",
    "however this study indicated the possibility of improving the description of the anomaly through the reconstructed energy corrections . in the present work we discuss in a more realistic way the influence of the smearing procedure on the two experiments both for the muon events from the @xmath0 beams and for the electron ones coming from the oscillation .",
    "the aim is to show the possible influence of nuclear physics effects on the determination of the oscillation parameter . for miniboone",
    "we discuss the cases both neutrinos and antineutrinos . in the first one we have the information that our description of the neutrino nucleus interaction is able to reproduce the double differential cross section with respect to the muon energy and emission angle .",
    "in the case of antineutrinos no such cross check can be made .",
    "the total `` quasielastic '' cross section is not published nor is the double differential cross section .",
    "we have to rely on a purely theoretical approach , which was described in our refs .",
    "its main features are summarized in the following section .",
    "in the following the word neutrino will mean neutrino or antineutrino , the lepton can be either a @xmath13 or an electron ( positron ) , depending on the reaction in question . for miniboone the oscillation events concern electron neutrinos and",
    "the interesting events represent the production of electron arising from the interaction of electron neutrinos in the cherenkov detector .",
    "the neutrino cross sections on nuclear targets are expressed in terms of nuclear responses , which represent the inelastic cross sections for a given type of coupling of the probe .",
    "for the charged current interaction case the probes have a purely isovector character and they can involve or not the nucleonic spins . our description of refs .",
    "@xcite introduces the multinucleon component only in the spin isospin response . for the comparison between neutrinos and antineutrinos",
    "the important point is the role played by this isovector response relative to that of the spin isospin ones . due to the negative sign of the axial vector interference term for antineutrinos",
    "the spin isospin contribution is diminished in the last case with respect to the isovector component . consequently in our description",
    "the relative role of the multinucleon part is smaller for antineutrinos .",
    "this particular point of our treatment of the multinucleon channel has been challenged @xcite .",
    "experimental data will select between different approaches but , whatever the outcome , the method that we introduce for extracting a real distribution energy distribution from the reconstructed one and our general conclusions on the reconstruction effect remain valid .",
    "the difference of nuclear effects between neutrinos and antineutrinos is a very important point as it can mimic or mask the display of cp violating effect which introduces an asymmetry between @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    in our last work",
    "@xcite we started from the electron events experimental distributions in terms of the reconstructed energy .",
    "we transformed these into distributions in terms of the real neutrino energy .",
    "we remind that this transformation itself depends on the electron neutrino energy distribution hence on the oscillation parameter .",
    "then we evaluated the theoretical expectations of the distribution with the same oscillation parameter .",
    "we could then confront theory and experiment .",
    "although perfectly valid this method has the following drawback . when data evolve , the whole smearing procedure has to be redone .",
    "moreover as each reconstructed energy bin influences the whole real energy distribution , negative values in certain bins influence the whole distribution . here",
    "we will proceed differently . indeed , as we observed in @xcite , the procedure is completely reversible and can be used in both directions . here",
    "we calculate the theoretical prediction for electron events energy distribution for a given value of the oscillation parameter .",
    "we then transform this distribution into one in terms of the reconstructed energy value , which can be directly compared to the experimental distribution . in principle",
    "we are then in a situation to investigate which oscillation parameter best fits the data .",
    "we also apply our smearing procedure to disappearance effects for the muon neutrinos in the t2k beam .",
    "the number of charged current events in a target for neutrinos of energy between @xmath2 and @xmath16 , for an energy transferred to the nuclear system , @xmath4 , and a lepton emission angle @xmath5 , is related to the double differential cross section by : @xmath17 the quantity @xmath18 is the triple density , in terms of the three variables , @xmath2 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . for our problem",

    "we have discussed the application of our reconstruction method to several oscillation experiments .",
    "starting from a theoretical energy distribution , product of the neutrino cross section by the neutrino energy distribution of the beam , we perform the reconstructed energy corrections . their influence is such that the events tend to escape from the region of high fluxes with a tendency to concentrate at lower energies .",
    "the smeared distribution effect depends on the particular shape of the neutrino energy distribution , the correction being more pronounced for broad distributions .",
    "we apply our procedure to the three distributions measured in t2k : muonic distributions in the close and far detector and electron distribution in the far detector .",
    "the effects are such that an analysis which takes into account the smearing effect is likely to lead to some increase of the oscillation mass value .",
    "we have also discussed the miniboone results where the oscillations , if they exist , imply sterile neutrinos with a much larger mass parameter , in the ev range .",
    "the accumulation of electron events observed in the low energy sector favors relatively low values of this mass term which imply large mixing angles , not compatible with existing constraints .",
    "we have shown that this contradiction can be in part solved by the inclusion of the smearing effects .",
    "we have also pointed out some possible problems which may occur in the evaluation of the background from the @xmath63 contamination of the @xmath0 beam . in the antineutrino case where we predict similar effects but not as pronounced , the elucidation of the difference with neutrinos , which is important for the cp violation determination , will come from the measurement in progress of the double differential cross sections . in all instances",
