    "quantum cryptography is one of the major applications of quantum information theories@xcite while other applications such as quantum teleportation and quantum computer require tens or even thousands of qubits , the quantum cryptography scenario such as bb84 protocol@xcite can be implemented , at least theoretically , using only single qubit technology .",
    "this is main reason why the quantum cryptography based on bb84 or ekert91@xcite is now at the stage of the industrial era@xcite .",
    "according to the usual bb84 protocol the sender ( alice ) sends a single qubit to the receiver ( bob ) by choosing randomly one of the conjugate bases @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 then bob performs a quantum mechanical measurements in these bases .",
    "after measurements , alice and bob communicate with each other via classical public channel and establish a secret quantum key by using only those cases in which the bases of alice and bob coincide .",
    "how much information an eavesdropper ( eve ) can gain when alice and bob perform the usual bb84 scheme ?",
    "the answer of this question is important to check the security of the quantum cryptography . in this reason",
    "many authors examined the various strategies with one- and two - dimensional probes@xcite . among them",
    "ref.@xcite derived the optimal ( or maximal ) mutual information between alice and eve as a function of the disturbance @xmath4 in the bb84 protocol .",
    "the final result can be summarized as follows : @xmath5   \\hspace{1.0 cm } { \\cal i}_{uv } = \\frac{1}{2 } \\phi \\left[2 \\sqrt{d_{xy } ( 1 - d_{xy } ) } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) is the optimal mutual information when alice sends a signal to bob via @xmath8 ( or @xmath9 ) basis , and @xmath10 .",
    "the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the disturbances in these bases .",
    "the most different point of the quantum cryptography from the classical one is the fact that eve can not get information from the trusted parties without arising the disturbance .",
    "this implies that the quantum scheme is more secure than the classical cryptography .",
    "-dependence of the optimal mutual information when alice and bob use the various different protocols.,height=302 ]    recently , many different cryptographic protocols have been studied from the purely theoretical ground ( at least at current stage ) even if most quantum cryptography has been demonstrated by making use of either one of bb84 or ekert91 protocols .",
    "one of the motivations for searching other protocols is to strength the security against eavesdropping .",
    "the simple extended protocol is a six - state protocol@xcite . in this protocol alice",
    "sends a signal to bob after choosing randomly one of three conjugate bases @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 the basis @xmath13 corresponds to the circular polarization if alice and bob use a photon polarization as a qubit . the optimal mutual information between alice and eve is plotted in fig .",
    "1 , which implies that the six - state protocol is more secure than usual four - state bb84 against eavesdropping .",
    "another extended protocol@xcite is that alice and bob use qutrit ( @xmath15 ) or more generally qudit ( @xmath16 ) instead of a qubit . the optimal mutual information in this protocol is also plotted in fig . 1 when @xmath15 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18",
    "1 indicates that the protocol with @xmath19-level system is more secure against eavesdropping with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the quantum cryptography with continuum@xcite and noisy states@xcite are under investigation .",
    "however , all of these other protocols seem to be far from embodiment in a few years from the aspect of experimental science .    in this paper we would like to explore the situation where many eavesdroppers ( eve1 , eve2 , @xmath20 ) attack the bb84 protocol optimally .",
    "we assume that all of the eavesdroppers think they are unique eavesdropper .",
    "our computation is based on the quantum circuit expression of the optimal eavesdropping strategy@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review ref.@xcite briefly . in this section",
    "we develop a computational technique , which is useful when many eavesdroppers try to attack optimally . in section iii",
    "we examine the situation where eve1 and eve 2 attack the usual bb84 protocol .",
    "information gain @xmath21 and mutual information @xmath22 are explicitly computed , where @xmath23 or @xmath24 corresponds to eve1 and eve2 respectively .",
    "when eve1 and eve2 attack via symmetric optimal strategy , we compute the bob s error rate or disturbance @xmath25 explicitly , where the subscript `` 2 '' denotes the two eavesdroppers .",
    "it turns out that both optimal strategies fail .",
    "although eve1 can gain information on alice s signal as much as possible , eve2 increases the disturbance or bob s error rate .",
    "for eve2 she can not gain information sufficiently due to eve1 s disturbance . in section",
    "iv we examine the situation where three eavesdroppers attack the bb84 protocol . the mutual information for each eavesdropper is analytically derived .",
    "furthermore , bob s error rate @xmath26 is also explicitly derived on condition that all eavesdroppers use the symmetric strategies . in section",
    "v we have generalized the results of the previous sections . when @xmath0 eavesdroppers attack , the mutual information for each eavesdropper is analytically derived .",
    "also the recursive relation of the bob s error rate is derived .",
    "it turns out that all optimal strategies eavesdroppers choose eventually fail except very rare cases .",
    "finally a brief concluding remark is given .",

    "now , we want to show that the entangled states ( [ 1optimal-2 ] ) with suitable povm measurement enables eve to get information optimally .",
    "the complete set of the positive operators , which is used for povm , can be derived generally as projective operators onto the eigenvectors of @xmath46 , where@xcite @xmath47 for our case the complete set of the positive operators is @xmath48 with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",

    ". 1 optimality of the eavesdropping does not uniquely depend on the quantity of information that eavesdropper can gain . in order to get success in the eavesdropping",

    "these two factors , increase of information gain and decrease of disturbance , determine the success or failure of the optimal strategy . as will be shown shortly , eve1 s optimal strategy fails because eve2 increases bob s error rate .",
    "for eve2 the information gain involves an interesting factor @xmath104 .",
    "s information gain depends on the eve1 s choice of @xmath105 .",
    "this is manifestly due to the fact that eve2 performs her optimal strategy after eve1 .",
    "if eve1 chooses @xmath106 , eve2 can get information as much as eve1 if @xmath107 .",
    "this indicates that eve2 can increase her information gain if eve1 does not disturb the signal alice sent to bob .",
    "the mutual information @xmath99 and @xmath100 reduce to @xmath108    now , let us turn into the bob s error rate .",
    "unlike the unique eavesdropper case discussed in the previous section the situation is very complicated . in this case it could happen that eve1 s disturbance and eve2 s successive disturbance does not generate an error to bob .",
    "thus equation corresponding to eq.([1optimal-9 ] ) in previous section should have one more index , i.e. @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "since , furthermore , both optimal strategies eve1 and eve2 have chosen do not get success , we expect to have @xmath111 .",
    "thus we should compute the bob s error rate separately when alice sends @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
