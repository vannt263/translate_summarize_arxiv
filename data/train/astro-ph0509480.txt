    "inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter are the source of peculiar velocities in the universe .",
    "the nature of this velocity field depends on the local density .",
    "high density regions show a collection of random motions typical of virialized objects whereas , low density environments , on the other hand , are more likely to show streaming motions : objects falling towards larger potential wells constantly increasing the amplitude of their clustering strength ( diaferio & geller , 1997 ) .    a possible model for describing the dynamical behavior of objects near regions of high density contrast",
    "is provided by the spherical infall model ( for a discussion see tolman , 1934 ; gunn & gott , 1972 ; silk , 1974 ; elkolm & teerrikorpi , 1994 ) .",
    "this model simplifies the problem by assuming that the initial density perturbation responsible for the formation of an object is spherically symmetric .",
    "the gravitational field around this perturbation traces the symmetry of the matter , and its pull induces peculiar motions over the surrounding area . here",
    "the velocity field takes the form of a collapsing streaming motion towards the local density maximum . in the linear perturbation case , the infall velocity ( @xmath17 ) depends on the distance to the local density maximum and is directly related to the density contrast ( peebles , 1980 ) ,    @xmath18    in high density regions , as is the case of neighborhoods of clusters and galaxy groups , linear theory is not expected to provide an adequate description ( croft et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , if we assume that mass overdensities are spherically symmetric , an approximate solution for the non - linear collapse can be found .",
    "this solution treats the overdensity as an isolated friedmman universe with its own value of @xmath19 ( for more details see gunn & gott , 1972 ; bondi , 1974 ; silk , 1974 ; gunn , 1978 ; rgos & geller , 1989 and references therein ) . for these non - linear regions ,",
    "the relation for linear collapse is replaced by an approximate solution ( yahil , 1985 ) .",
    "this solution has shown to give accurate results outside the virialized regions of groups and clusters of galaxies .    in this work",
    "we investigate the structure of the peculiar velocity field around groups of galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "we apply the spherical infall model to test the effects of overdensities in the density field , traced by groups of galaxies , on the dynamical properties of their surrounding regions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the observational data samples used to perform the statistical analyses .",
    "we describe the semi - analytic mock catalogs in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains the description of the statistical methods adopted to obtain the results shown in sections 5 and 6 . in section 7 we show the results of the method described in section 3 applied to the mock catalogs . in section 8 we apply a correction factor to consider distance uncertainties on the amplitude of infall velocities and we use these estimates to predict the integrated mass overdensity associated to groups from linear theory .",
    "finally , we make a brief discussion of the results .",
    "in this section we describe in detail the observational samples used in this paper .",
    "we use two different sets of data .",
    "the first set is composed of tracers of the density peaks , which in this work are galaxy groups from the updated zwicky catalog ( uzc ; merchn et al .",
    "2000 ) and the southern sky redshift survey ( ssrs2 ) .",
    "the second set of data contains galaxy peculiar velocity information taken from the compilation of giovanelli and haynes ( 2002 , hereafter cpv ) , which we use to investigate the velocity field around mass concentrations .",
    "we use the uzc group catalog constructed by merchn et.al ( 2000 ) .",
    "these groups were identified from the uzc galaxy catalog ( falco et al .",
    "1999 ) which contains 19,369 galaxies with apparent zwicky magnitudes @xmath20 and with a @xmath21 completeness in redshift .",
    "the region covered by the catalog is bounded by @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , providing accurate coordinates within 2@xmath25 and reliable redshifts in the range @xmath26 km s@xmath1 , with a reasonably complete sky coverage ( see falco et al .",
    "1999 for more details ) .",
    "the algorithm adopted by merchn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for the construction of the group catalog follows the basic procedure described by huchra & geller ( 1982 ) with the improvements introduced by maia et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and ramella et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that minimize the number of interlopers .",
    "the group inner regions have a density contrast relative to the mean density of galaxies @xmath27 .",
    "the uzc group catalog ( guzc ) contains systems with at least four members and mean radial velocities , @xmath28 15,000 comprising a total number of 513 groups .",
    "the top half of figure [ fig : uzcg ] shows the angular distribution of the cpv galaxies and uzc groups .",
    "as can be seen , these objects are all concentrated on the northern hemisphere , with a sampling rate that does not present important variations across the solid angle covered .",
    "we also use groups identified from the ssrs2 catalog ( da costa et al .",
    "1998 ) which comprises 5369 objects with apparent b magnitudes @xmath29 .",
    "the region covered is 1.70 sr in the southern celestial hemisphere providing accurate coordinates within 1@xmath25 .",
    "this catalog of groups was constructed using the same algorithm used for the guzc ( merchn , 2000 ) .",
    "the ssrs2 group catalog contains systems with a minimum of four members and mean radial velocities , @xmath28 15,000 , comprising a total of 386 groups .",
    "the bottom half in figure [ fig : uzcg ] shows the angular positions of groups from the ssrs2 and cpv southern galaxies .",
    "peculiar velocities have been derived for 4452 galaxies using i - band photometry and either optical long slit spectroscopy or global hi profiles ( e.g. dale & giovanelli 2000 ) .",
    "the sample includes objects in the haynes  ( 1999 ) , mathewson & ford ( 1996 ) and giovanelli  ( 1997a ) compilations , as well as more recently processed data , the public presentation of which is in preparation by our group .",
    "widths derived from optical rotation curves follow the method outlined in giovanelli & haynes ( 2002 ) .",
    "peculiar velocities were derived using the template relation and the derivation technique presented in giovanelli  ( 1997b ) .",
    "analyses of the large  scale flow properties of the peculiar velocity field based on these samples are summarized in dale & giovanelli ( 2000 ) .",
    "in order to compare model predictions to observational results we use mock catalogs extracted from a high resolution n - body simulation populated with galaxies using the semianalytic model galform ( cole et al . 2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2002 ) , by the theory group at the university of durham .",
    "the numerical simulation uses standard @xmath30cdm parameters , a normalization @xmath31 , and a primordial spectral index of @xmath32 , in agreement with the constraints from the first year of data from wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "the n - body simulation box is @xmath33 mpc on a side and contains @xmath34 dark matter particles of mass @xmath35 .",
    "dark matter halos are identified in the @xmath36 output using a friends of friend method and rejecting those halos with less than @xmath37 particles . as a result ,",
    "the halo resolution limit is @xmath38 .",
    "the procedure followed by the durham group for populating the dark matter halos follows the technique described by benson et al .",
    "essentially , the galform code is run for each halo , and galaxies are assigned to a subset of dark matter particles in the halo . around @xmath39 of central galaxies brighter than @xmath40 are expected to be in halos resolved by the simulation .",
    "the effective limit of the catalog was extended to @xmath41 using a separate galform calculation for a grid of halo masses below the resolution limit of the n - body simulation .",
    "these galaxies are assigned to particles that are not identified as part of a dark matter halo .",
    "first , we investigate the infall of mass particles onto the dark matter halos in the numerical simulation .",
    "figure [ fig : vcube20 ] shows the mean infall velocity of dark matter particles and semianalytic galaxies in the simulation cube as a function of distance to the halo center of mass .",
    "we show results for the full sample of semianalytic galaxies and for those with @xmath42 .",
    "this figure shows in different shades of gray , results for subsamples of halos defined using different lower mass limits .",
    "as can be seen , galaxies show a similar infall velocity to dark matter particles even when they are restricted to brighter galaxies .",
    "the infall velocities seem to be marginally lower for galaxies than for the dark matter .    in a second step ,",
    "we extract mock catalogs from the numerical simulation .",
    "these play a fundamental role in our analysis .",
    "we use them to tailor our algorithms to extract the maximum streaming motion signal and to asses random and systematic errors in our calculations .",
    "we estimate systematic errors by comparing the results measured from the mock catalogs with the results from measuring the streaming motions in the simulation cube .",
    "random errors are calculated by the dispersion of streaming motions measured from each individual mock galaxy around the mean infall velocities from all the mock galaxies .",
    "mock uzc and ssrs2 are constructed by placing an observer at a random location within the simulation box and applying the radial and angular selection function of the uzc and ssrs2 , respectively .",
    "we also assign each mock galaxy a morphological type , which is assumed to be a function of the stellar formation rate ( sfr ; high sfr corresponds to late types , low sfr to early types ) .",
    "the group finding algorithm is applied to the galaxy mock catalog in the same way as for the real data to construct a mock group catalog that mimics uzc groups . in order to obtain a cpv mock catalog",
    "we take account the fact that cpv data comprise mainly late - type galaxies , so we apply a further constraint to account for this in our mock galaxy sample by restricting it to late types .",
    "finally , we also impose the radial velocity distribution of cpv galaxies to this sample ( see figure [ fig : nzn ] ) .",
    "in addition , the mock catalogs are selected so as to reproduce the local group velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background and also the surrounding structures , which consist mainly of reasonably important filaments aligned with the observer s line of sight to @xmath43 degrees .",
    "figure [ fig : nzn ] shows the number of cpv galaxies as a function of redshift [ @xmath44 . in the figure , the mock redshift distribution is shown as a dashed histogram and the real data of @xmath45 are shown as a solid histogram .",
    "in this work , we analyse the statistical properties of galaxy peculiar velocities in the neighborhoods of galaxy groups .",
    "galaxies are considered to be test particles under the gravitational action of a spherically symmetric overdensity in the matter distribution , traced by the positions of galaxy groups .",
    "the infall model provides a description for the radial collapse of galaxies towards higher density regions .",
    "we expect this model to be a good approximation to the actual dynamics in the local universe , with a less important tangential component in the streaming motions of galaxies . in this analysis",
    "we will assume the motions are only radial .",
    "we can find the mean infall of galaxies onto groups and clusters using galaxy peculiar velocities , which give only the line - of - sight projection of the three - dimensional velocity vector .",
    "the effect of this projection can be described in a simple way as a function of the galaxy position relative to both the group center and the observer by the linear relation @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the angle subtended by the observer and the galaxy as seen from the group center .",
    "we have neglected in this analysis group peculiar velocities whose effects are expected to cancel out in this statistical study .",
    "+ we analyse the dependence of galaxy peculiar velocities , @xmath48 , on @xmath49 in different spherical concentric shells around the individual groups and calculate averages @xmath50 and its standard mean deviation @xmath51 for different bins in @xmath49 for the total group sample .    in order to enhance the statistical significance of our results we adopt an iterative process by which we repeatedly calculate @xmath52 from a reduced sample of galaxies .",
    "the reduced sample is constructed by removing all the galaxies which lie at more than @xmath53 from the mean linear relation calculated from the sample of galaxies used in the previous iteration .",
    "we adopt four iterations , which is enough to stabilize the results .    the mean infall amplitude @xmath54 as a function of scale @xmath55 is derived from least - squares linear fitting applied to the observed @xmath52 versus @xmath56 measured on shells of radius @xmath55 around the groups .",
    "then @xmath54 is simply the slope of the line fitted to the data ( see equation [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "in order to analyze the dynamical properties of cpv galaxies we have selected groups in the radial velocity range @xmath57 km s@xmath58 km s@xmath1 . we define concentric spherical shells around each group in our samples and identify the galaxies that lie in them .",
    "once we do this , we can calculate the angle @xmath47 subtended by the directions to the galaxy and the observer from the center of the group .    in figure",
    "[ fig : vpanels ] we show the mean projected peculiar velocity as a function of @xmath47 bins for the cpv galaxies and uzc groups .",
    "the different panels correspond to spherical shells of different radii @xmath55 .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , there is an important variation of @xmath54 with shell radius . in this figure , errors are derived from the scatter of measurements obtained from the data . at small @xmath55 ,",
    "the errors are larger than the mean peculiar velocity because galaxies do not follow radial trajectories near the center of the groups ( panel a ) . in the external regions errors become smaller and the infall motions show stable values over a wide range of distances .",
    "the maximum in infall amplitude occurs at @xmath0 h@xmath1 mpc @xmath2 @xmath55 @xmath2 @xmath59 h@xmath1 mpc ; at these scales the predominant motions are aligned with the radial direction ( panels b , c and d ) . at scales",
    "@xmath60 h@xmath1 mpc , the influence of surrounding structures starts to affect the values of infall velocities ( panels e and f ) , which become consistent with values @xmath61",
    "km s@xmath1 , because of the large error bars .",
    "we repeat this analysis using groups and galaxies in the southern hemisphere and show in figure [ fig : vns ] the resulting values of streaming motions @xmath17 for both the ssrs2 and uzc galaxies ( from the southern and northern hemisphere respectively ) and for the combined set of samples ( north and south ) . the solid line in the figure [ fig : vns ]",
    "summarizes the results shown in figure [ fig : vpanels ] . here",
    "each point corresponds to the slope of the lines fitted in each panel of [ fig : vpanels ] , and errors represent the scatter of results from individual mock catalogs around their mean ( see section 3 ) .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : vns ] , there is a clear indication of infall motions outside the virialized regions . at the largest radius",
    "the infall signal is negligible , an expected effect caused by the action of the gravitational pull of neighboring groups .",
    "the results are similar for both hemispheres .",
    "once we have a direct detection of the infall of galaxies onto groups , we can study possible dependencies of the amplitude of infall velocities on group properties .",
    "it is expected that the amplitude of the infall velocities increases with group mass . in order to test this assumption",
    "we must obtain estimates of the group masses .",
    "this can be achieved by two independent methods .",
    "the first approach is to compute the group virial mass which in spite of having the advantage of being a direct estimate , is subject to significant uncertainties mainly due to small number statistics .",
    "a second approach is to estimate group masses by measuring the total luminosity of group member galaxies .",
    "this method can provide a suitable estimate of the group mass by assuming a constant m / l relation and is less unstable regarding small number statistics ( padilla et al .",
    "2004 , eke et al .",
    "we have considered the dependence of the amplitude of infall on group luminosity .",
    "we estimate group luminosities in the @xmath62 band by adding up galaxy luminosities from the uzc catalog that are within @xmath63 h@xmath1 mpc from the group center , with a relative velocity @xmath64 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this provides a rough estimate of the groups total luminosity and serves as an adequate procedure to deal with two subsamples of different total luminosities .",
    "these subsamples are constructed such that they contain similar numbers of groups .    in figure",
    "[ fig : infmvl ] we show the resulting infall velocities derived from the two group subsamples subdivided by luminosity ( @xmath65 l@xmath7 and @xmath66 l@xmath7 ) .",
    "as can be seen , there is a remarkable difference between the infall amplitude of both subsamples .",
    "we also show in figure [ fig : infmvl ] the infall onto subsamples of groups subdivided according to virial masses ( @xmath67 m@xmath7 and @xmath68 m@xmath7 ) . as in the case",
    "in which we define our subsamples using group luminosities , the subdivision by mass is set so that both subsamples contain nearly equal numbers .    by inspection to figure [ fig : infmvl ] , it can be seen that by subdividing the sample by luminosity , the difference in the amplitude of infall velocities is larger than by subdividing the sample by virial mass .",
    "this larger dependence of the amplitude of infall on group luminosity with respect to virial mass may reflect the fact that the latter might be more subject to large uncertainties than estimates of mass derived from luminosity , in agreement with padilla et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and eke et al .",
    "we calculate the mean streaming peculiar velocity towards simulated groups for galaxies in the mock catalogs by using the same methods that we applied to the observational data . in panel",
    "a ) of figure [ fig : vinfmock ] we show the mean infall motions ( averaged over seven mock catalogs ) for two subsamples of groups per mock catalog defined by two different lower limits in dynamical mass .",
    "we find that in scales ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath69 h@xmath1 mpc the predominant motion occurs preferentially in the radial direction .",
    "closer to the group centers , errors in @xmath17 ( calculated from the scatter among seven mock catalog ) grow larger as virialized motions start to dominate the galaxy velocities . at large separations",
    ", the infall signal disappears , probably because of the effect of neighboring groups .",
    "the results obtained from the mock samples are at least in qualitative agreement with the observational data .",
    "the resulting average infall velocities recovered from the mock catalogs and thosse measured directly from the simulation box are comparable . for instance , at separations of @xmath37 h@xmath1mpc , the values of infall are @xmath70km / s and @xmath71km / s for the mock and cube data , respectively , for halos with @xmath72h@xmath1m@xmath7 . in the case of the most massive halos with @xmath73h@xmath1m@xmath7 , the infall velocities become @xmath74km / s and @xmath75 km / s , respectively . as a note of caution",
    ", one should therefore bear in mind that the relation between infall amplitude and halo mass seems to be slightly less step when measured from the mock catalogs , which show consistent infall amplitudes for the low - mass halos and lower amplitudes for the high - mass halos than the true underlying value .    up to this point",
    ", peculiar velocities in the mock catalogs were not affected by measurement errors .",
    "we apply a distance measurement error proportional to the distance to the galaxies similar to the one that affects the observational data .",
    "we consider an uncertainty of @xmath76 in the distance measurement , repeat the calculation of infall velocities for the mock catalogs , and show the results in panel b of figure [ fig : vinfmock ] . by comparing this panel to panel a ) and panel c ) which show the infall motions for the mock catalog without errors and for the uzc data , respectively , it can be seen that errors in distance measurementes bring the results from synthetic data closer to the observational data . in order to correct for the effect of distance uncertainties in the inferred infall velocities ,",
    "we compare the results from the mock catalogs with and without distance errors .",
    "we calculate the ratio @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the infall amplitude of the mock catalogs with distance errors ( see panel b in figure [ fig : vinfmock ] ) and @xmath79 is the infall amplitude from the mock catalogs without distance errors ( see panel a in figure [ fig : vinfmock ] ) .",
    "panel a of figure [ fig : meismi ] shows @xmath80 for different scales and a fitting function of the form @xmath81 , which is sufficient to provide a good description of the ratio of observed to actual velocities .",
    "we find that a=2.4 , b=0.125 , and c=-1.94 provide a good fit to the measured values of @xmath80 .",
    "as it can be seen in this figure , the correction factor @xmath80 increases slightly with scale , with a mimimun value @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain realistic estimates , all the inferred infall velocities should be reduced by these values .",
    "we note , however , that the resulting infall velocities do not depend significantly on the particular function adopted to fit the correction factor @xmath80 .",
    "panel b in figure [ fig : meismi ] shows the corrected mean amplitude for two ranges in group virial mass .",
    "we note that the lower values of the corrected infall velocities are in suitable agreement with those shown in figure [ fig : vcube20 ] for mass and galaxies in the @xmath30 cdm model .",
    "in this section we assume that the linear theory prediction that relates the integrated mass overdensity with an infall peculiar velocity is valid at distances greater than @xmath0 h@xmath1 mpc . by doing this we can directly derive the mean integrated mass overdensity ( @xmath86 ) in a spherical volume centered on the groups . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the results from the mock catalogs indicate that the effects of distance uncertainties must be corrected for in order to derive the actual mean infall velocities .",
    "we apply the correction @xmath87/@xmath79 to the infall velocities measured from the observational data ( plotted in figure [ fig : vns ] ) .",

    "<S> we perform statistical analyses to study the infall of galaxies onto groups and clusters in the nearby universe . </S>",
    "<S> the study is based on the updated zwicky catalog and southern sky redshift survey 2 group catalogs and peculiar velocity samples . </S>",
    "<S> we find a clear signature of infall of galaxies onto groups over a wide range of scales @xmath0 h@xmath1 mpc@xmath2 r @xmath3 h@xmath1 mpc , with an infall amplitude on the order of a few hundred kilometers per second . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a significant increase in the infall amplitude with group virial mass ( @xmath4 ) and luminosity of group member galaxies ( @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> groups with @xmath6 m@xmath7 show infall velocities @xmath8 km s@xmath1 whereas for @xmath9 m@xmath7 a larger infall is observed , @xmath10 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we find that galaxies surrounding groups with @xmath11 l@xmath7 have @xmath12 km s@xmath1 , whereas for @xmath13 l@xmath7 groups , the amplitude of the galaxy infall can be as large as @xmath14 km s@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the observational results are compared with the results obtained from mock group and galaxy samples constructed from numerical simulations , which include galaxy formation through semianalytical models . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a general agreement between the results from the mock catalogs and the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the infall of galaxies onto groups is suitably reproduced in the simulations and , as in the observations , larger virial mass and luminosity groups exhibit the largest galaxy infall amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we derive estimates of the integrated mass overdensities associated with groups by applying linear theory to the infall velocities after correcting for the effects of distance uncertainties obtained using the mock catalogs . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting overdensities are consistent with a power law with @xmath15 at @xmath16 . </S>"
