    "energy management in buildings has attracted significant attention worldwide , since recent studies @xcite have shown that more than 30% of the total electricity consumption in europe and in the united states is related to buildings and half of that to climate control . on the same time , a paradigm shift in energy operations has been observed , where energy management shall be performed at a network level , with buildings sharing certain equipment such as storage devices that might be expensive to have at an individual level .",
    "constructing algorithms for optimal energy management in building networks will play a prominent role in the envisioned operational paradigm , allowing demand modulation through intelligent control and coordination of certain appliances , or demand deferrability by appropriate use of the storage devices . to achieve this ,",
    "not only conventional energy management methods need to be revisited , but also conceptually different control and coordination schemes have to be designed .    towards this direction ,",
    "optimization based algorithms have been already successfully applied to the problem of energy management in buildings , due to their ability to handle the multi - objective nature of the problem ( e.g. , minimize energy costs , maximize building utility ) , while taking physical and/or technological constraints ( e.g. , storage limits , comfort constraints ) into account .",
    "studies in this direction include , but are not limited to , @xcite .",
    "moreover , numerical tools that support these algorithms together with further modeling refinements have been documented in @xcite , under the framework of the opticontrol research project @xcite . in",
    "most of these works the building modules are modelled by resistance - capacitance circuits , where the temperature set - point of each building zone or room is treated as control input ( assuming that a low level controller will track this set - point ) , set according to the optimization program that encodes the energy management problem . to achieve tractability , both the objective and the constraint functions",
    "are chosen to be convex ( or some convex approximation is employed ) and linearized system dynamics are considered .    despite the notable research activity in building control and energy management , in all the aforementioned references the underlying algorithm refers to a single building or room . recently , in @xcite , a compositional perspective is adopted , allowing for smart - grid control that involves scheduling of multiple building zones , chiller plants , storage devices , etc , interacting with each other , whereas in @xcite an energy - hub perspective is adopted , investigating the problem of managing a collection of buildings in a cooperative manner .",
    "however , the network encoding the interaction among the different modules is considered to be time - invariant , and the problem is solved in a centralized fashion . in  @xcite , a hierarchical scheme implementing a decentralized heuristic solution is proposed , which accounts also for the on - off switching of devices . in @xcite a decentralized control methodology is applied to a home energy management problem , whereas in @xcite a decentralized approach for solving optimal power flow type of problems in transmission networks is proposed , using the alternating direction method of multipliers @xcite . in both cases the underlying network topology is assumed to be time - invariant .",
    "there are two main challenges in all these approaches : first , a time - invariant network does not allow encoding unanticipated events like component and/or communication failures .",
    "second , adopting a centralized or decentralized regulation regime requires all buildings to share information about their consumption patterns , encoded through their individual objective ( utility ) functions and constraint sets , with each other , or to disclose this information to some central authority .",
    "this raises , however , privacy issues , increases the communication requirements and poses computational challenges for large scale problem instances .    in this paper , we overcome these difficulties and deal with the problem of distributed energy management in buildings connected over a ( possibly ) time - varying network , sharing common resources like a storage unit . to model each individual building in the network we adopt the convex formulation proposed in @xcite , which constitutes a model of finer granularity compared to @xcite . our distributed methodology is based on the iterative algorithm that has been recently proposed in @xcite , and relies on proximal minimization @xcite .",
    "it is of similar nature with gradient / subgradient algorithms @xcite , however , it imposes fewer assumptions and it does not require differentiability of the objective function or computation of subgradients .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed comparison with gradient / subgradient algorithms .",
    "the building control problem exhibits a particular structure , involving a high number of local optimization variables , and only a few number of global ones that couple the objective functions and the constraint sets of the buildings .",
    "we exploit this structure and propose an extension of the algorithm in @xcite , which is applicable to any problem that exhibits such a structure and has the advantage of reducing the exchange of information to the global optimization variables only , thus achieving significant communication savings compared to @xcite .",
    "the value taken by the global optimization variables will indeed affect the optimization of the local ones , which , however , is performed locally to each agent .",
    "the theoretical guarantees provided in @xcite on the convergence to a minimizer of the centralized counterpart of the problem are shown to still hold in this structured setting .",
    "note that in @xcite , a distributed algorithm over a time - varying network is developed , and is applied to a demand side management problem .",
    "however , it does not involve models of the same detail as the ones considered here , while from an algorithmic point of view , it is based on subgradient methods as opposed to the proximal minimization approach adopted in this paper , and involves a primal - dual iterative scheme that leads to a higher communication exchange compared to the proposed algorithm that does not require a dual update step .",
    "our contributions can be summarized as follows : 1 ) we provide a general formulation of the energy management problem over time - varying networks .",
    "2 ) we extend the distributed algorithm of @xcite to a certain class of problems , achieving optimality while imposing fewer communication requirements .",
    "3 ) we apply the proposed algorithm to the building energy management problem , and perform a detailed simulation based study , considering different network topologies .",
    "the rest of the paper unfolds as follows : in section [ sec : secii ] we provide details regarding the modeling of a district network , which include buildings and their chillers , and a shared thermal storage .",
    "section [ sec : seciii ] provides the formulation of the energy management problem over a building network , and includes a detailed exposition and analysis of the proposed distributed algorithm .",
    "section [ sec : seciv ] provides a simulation based study , whereas section [ sec : secv ] concludes the paper and provides some directions for future work .",
    "all proofs omitted from the main body of the paper can be found in the appendix .",
    "in this section we provide a description of the mathematical models for an individual building , a chiller plant and an energy storage , which constitute the basic modules of the district network for the analysis of section [ sec : seciii ] , where the energy management problem of a network of buildings interacting with each other , each of them equipped with its own chiller plant , that share a common storage , is considered .",
    "the models considered in this work are necessarily simplified to facilitate the control purposes of section [ sec : seciii ] , but they offer an accurate enough representation of a building from an energy management point of view .",
    "we will focus on energy management over a finite time horizon , divided into @xmath0 time slots , each of them having duration @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , modeling concerns the energy contribution of the building , the chiller plant and the storage per time slot @xmath2 , @xmath3 . in the sequel we provide a detailed description for each of them .      consider a building composed of @xmath4 zones . for",
    "all @xmath3 , @xmath5 , let @xmath6 be the cooling energy request of building zone @xmath7 during time slot @xmath2 .",
    "denote then by @xmath8 the energy request of the building over the time slot @xmath2 , and by @xmath9 the energy request of the building over the entire horizon .",
    "for all @xmath3 , , @xmath5 , @xmath10 constitutes of four energy contributions , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the amount of thermal energy exchanged between walls and zone @xmath7 over the time slot @xmath2 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the thermal energy produced by people and by other internal sources of heat in zone @xmath7 , respectively , and @xmath15 is the energy contribution of the thermal inertia of zone @xmath7 , over the time slot @xmath2 .",
    "we next provide a detailed description for each of these terms .",
    "walls separate the building zones from each other , as well as from the outside ambient .",
    "each wall is divided into vertical layers , referred to as slices , that differ in width and material composition , while each of them is assumed to have uniform density and temperature .",
    "each internal slice exchanges heat only with nearby slices through conduction , while boundary slices also exchange heat via convection and thermal radiation through surfaces that are exposed towards either a zone or the outdoor environment .",
    "external surfaces are assumed to be grey and opaque , with equal absorbance and emissivity and with zero transmittance .",
    "absorbance and emissivity are wavelength - dependent quantities , hence we consider different values for shortwave and longwave radiation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the number of walls in the building , and assume that each wall is composed of @xmath17 slices .",
    "the fact that we assume the same number of slices per wall is to simplify notation , while the case of a different number of slices per wall is straightforward to model .",
    "following @xcite , for all @xmath18 , @xmath19 , the temperature @xmath20 in slice @xmath21 of wall @xmath22 , evolves according to @xmath23 ,      \\label{eq : slice_balance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 denotes the thermal capacity per unit area , and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 , represent the conductive and the convective heat transfer coefficients between slices @xmath21 and @xmath27 , respectively . @xmath28",
    "denote the incoming shortwave and longwave radiation power per unit area , respectively , while @xmath29 are the corresponding absorbance rates for slice @xmath21 of wall @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath30 is the emitted radiation as a function of the temperature @xmath20 , @xmath31 is the emissivity , and @xmath32 is the thermal power generation inside slice @xmath21 of wall @xmath22 .    in , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath36 appear , respectively .",
    "they denote the temperature of either a zone of the building or the ambient temperature , according to whether the boundary slice @xmath37 ( similarly for @xmath17 ) of wall @xmath22 is at the border with some building zone or with the outdoor environment .",
    "it should be noted that , for all @xmath38 , we have that @xmath39 since there is no thermal conduction on slices that are the walls boundary surfaces , and @xmath40 , for all @xmath41 , @xmath42 , for all @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , for all @xmath45 , since there is no thermal convection nor radiation in between slices . since each wall is assumed to be a grey body , the power @xmath46 radiated from slice @xmath21 of wall @xmath22 , is given by @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the stefan - boltzmann constant ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this expression is approximately linear around the mean operating temperature @xmath49 of slice @xmath21 of wall @xmath22 , and hence the aforementioned nonlinear expression can be approximated by the following equation , which is linear in @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath50    for @xmath38 , denote by @xmath51{^\\top}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{n_s}$ ] the vector that contains the temperatures of all slices of wall @xmath22 . for @xmath52 ,",

    "for all @xmath5 , let @xmath73 denote the set of indices that correspond to walls that are adjacent to zone @xmath7 . for all @xmath5 , the thermal power that is transferred to zone @xmath7 from its adjacent walls",
    "is given by @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the surface area of wall @xmath22 .",
    "the pair @xmath76 is either @xmath77 or @xmath78 , according to which slice ( i.e. , @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) is at the border of wall @xmath79 with zone @xmath7 . defining @xmath80{^\\top}\\in \\mathbb{r}^{n_z}$ ] , we can thus represent @xmath81 as a function of @xmath82 and @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are matrices of appropriate dimension .",
    "equations and form a linear dynamical system with state @xmath82 , input @xmath56 , disturbance @xmath86 , and output @xmath81 . the obtained system , though linear , can be quite large .",
    "however , following @xcite , its order can be greatly reduced by applying model reduction techniques ; this approach was adopted in the case study of section [ sec : seciv ] .    since the energy management algorithm of section [ sec : seciii ]",
    "is developed in discrete time , we can discretize - to obtain a discrete time linear dynamical system . for the discretization process",
    "it was assumed that @xmath56 and @xmath86 vary linearly within each time slot of duration @xmath87 .",
    "let then @xmath88 , @xmath3 , be the thermal power calculated by meas of the discretized model , where , with a slight abuse of notation , we use the same symbol with the continuous time model ( see @xcite for more details on the discretization process ) .",
    "due to the fact that the elements of @xmath89 were assumed to vary linearly within each time slot , the thermal energy @xmath90 transferred by all walls to zone @xmath7 over the time slot @xmath2 , can be computed from the thermal power as @xmath91 for all @xmath5 , @xmath3 .",
    "note that after discretizing - , @xmath92 , and hence also @xmath90 , depends on an affine fashion on the temperatures of zone @xmath7 ut to time @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath93 for all @xmath94 .",
    "people produce heat and , in buildings with high occupancy , their contribution to the total thermal energy generation is significant .",
    "let @xmath95 denote the number of occupants in zone @xmath7 , and denote by @xmath96 the thermal power produced by them at zone temperature @xmath97 , @xmath5 .",
    "following @xcite , @xmath98 is given as a product of @xmath95 and a quadratic function of @xmath97 .",
    "however , this function is approximately linear for the sensible range of operating temperatures that are of interest for our analysis",
    ". therefore , without introducing a significant modeling error , for each @xmath5 , we can linearize it around some comfort temperature of zone @xmath7 , thus obtaining @xmath99 where @xmath100 are constants that are different per zone @xmath7 , since they depend on the chosen comfort temperature of zone @xmath7 .",
    "note that @xmath95 and @xmath97 depend on time continuously .",
    "moreover , following @xcite , @xmath95 can be approximated as a linear function of time , while @xmath97 , @xmath5 , has been already assumed to evolve linearly within each time slot .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath101 , @xmath5 , we can then integrate the people thermal power @xmath98 in analytically over @xmath102 $ ] to obtain the energy contribution @xmath103 due to people occupancy at zone @xmath7 over the time slot @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath104 where the coefficients @xmath105 are different per zone @xmath7 and time slot @xmath2 , since they depend on the values of @xmath95 at @xmath106 and @xmath107 ; further details can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are many other types of heat sources that may affect the internal thermal energy of a building , e.g. , internal lighting , electrical equipment , daylight radiation through windows , etc . for each @xmath5 ,",
    "the overall thermal energy of zone @xmath7 due to these sources can be computed as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a coefficient that takes into account the mean absorbance coefficient of zone @xmath7 , the transmittance coefficients of the windows and their areas , the sun view and the shading factors , and the radiation incidence angle .",
    "the last two terms in encode the thermal energy contribution to zone @xmath7 , @xmath5 , due to internal lightening and electrical equipment .",
    "in particular , it is composed of a constant term @xmath110 , and an additional contribution @xmath111 when people are present , i.e. , when @xmath112 .",
    "note that @xmath113 does not depend on the longwave radiation @xmath63 , due to the fact that the windows are usually shielded against it .",
    "note that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are time independent , however , @xmath95 , @xmath62 and @xmath116 depend on time continuously .",
    "therefore , we first discretize the thermal power @xmath113 in , and then integrate it to obtain the energy term @xmath117 within each time slot @xmath2 , @xmath3 .      to lower the temperature of a zone we need to draw energy from the zone itself . following @xcite , for all @xmath3 , @xmath5 , this inertial contribution of zone @xmath7 to the overall thermal energy in the building over the time slot @xmath2 ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the equivalent heat capacity of the @xmath120 zone .",
    "a chiller plant converts electric energy into cooling energy .",
    "the cooling energy is then transferred to the building via , e.g. , the chilled water circuit .",
    "denote by @xmath121 the electric energy absorbed by the chiller to provide cooling energy @xmath122 over a time slot of duration @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "following the ng - gordon model of @xcite , which is based on entropy and energy balance equations , the electric and the cooling energy can be related by @xmath123 denotes the ambient temperature and @xmath124 the temperature of the cooling water at time slot @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is typically regulated by low level controllers so that it is maintained at some prescribed optimal operational value .",
    "coefficients @xmath125 characterize the chiller performance and , depending on their values , we can have different efficiency curves as given by the so called coefficient of performance ( cop ) .",
    "the cop is the ratio between the produced cooling energy and the corresponding electrical energy consumption . as such , the larger is the cop , the more efficient the chiller is .    to facilitate the optimization based algorithm of section [ sec : seciiib ] , we employ the following convex approximation of , which results in a biquadratic relationship between the electrical and the cooling energy of the chiller .",
    "@xmath126 where , for each @xmath3 , the functions @xmath127 depend on the ambient temperature @xmath123 .",
    "the approximate relationship in is determined from using weighted least squares to best fit the most relevant points , i.e , those that correspond to zero energy request and to the maximum cop values .",
    "the quality of the biquadratic approximation in , compared to the full model in , is illustrated in figure [ fig : chiller ] .",
    "thermal energy storage is becoming widely used since it represents the most effective way , and often the only way , to take advantage of renewable energy sources .",
    "there are many different technical solutions to store thermal energy ; the most widely used are fluid tanks and phase changing materials . in buildings , and more generally in a smart grid context , they can be used as energy buffers for unbinding energy production from energy consumption . in particular , thermal energy storage for cooling energy can shift the production of cooling energy to off - peak hours of electrical energy consumption , make chillers operate in high - efficiency conditions , and smoothen peaks of electrical energy request with benefits both for power production and distribution network systems .    from an energy oriented perspective we will model a thermal energy storage employing black box system identification techniques , that use the energy exchange ( drawn or inserted ) as input and the thermal energy stored as output .",
    "this way of modeling does not consider the way energy is stored or provided . to this end , a first order autoregressive exogenous ( arx ) system is considered : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the amount of cooling energy stored . in view of the multi - building problem considered in the next section",
    "we assume that the storage device is shared among @xmath130 buildings , and denote by @xmath131 the cooling energy exchanged ( @xmath132 if the storage is discharged , and @xmath133 if it is charged ) , with building @xmath134 , @xmath135 , in time slot @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath136 is introduced to model energy losses .",
    "note that can be thought of as a discrete time integrator , where the stored energy @xmath137 at time @xmath138 is computed by accumulating the cooling energy exchanged with all buildings up to time @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath139 for all @xmath94 .",
    "consider a network of @xmath130 buildings , each of them equipped with a different chiller plant , that share a common storage so as to avoid usage inefficiencies and increase the return on investment of the storage resource , which might be expensive to afford at an individual level . to this end ,",
    "append to all quantities introduced in the previous section the superscript @xmath134 , to denote that they correspond to building @xmath134 , @xmath135 , e.g. , @xmath140 denotes the cooling energy of the chiller at building @xmath134 at time slot @xmath2 , @xmath141 denotes the vector of zone temperatures at building @xmath134 , etc .    for each @xmath135 , @xmath3 , the electric energy request of building @xmath134 over the time slot @xmath2",
    "is given by the chiller electric energy request @xmath140 .",
    "the latter is in turn related to the cooling energy exchange terms via .",

    "<S> this paper deals with energy management in a district where multiple buildings can communicate over a time - varying network and aim at optimizing the use of shared resources like storage systems . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on building cooling , and propose an iterative , distributed algorithm that accounts for information privacy , since buildings are not required to disclose information about their individual utility functions and constraint sets encoding , e.g. , their consumption profiles , and overcomes the communication and computational challenges imposed by centralized management paradigms . </S>",
    "<S> our approach relies on a methodology based on proximal minimization that has recently appeared in the literature . motivated by the structure of the considered energy management optimization program , we provide a theoretical extension of this novel methodology , that is applicable to any problem that exhibits such structural properties . </S>",
    "<S> the efficacy of the resulting energy management algorithm is illustrated by means of a detailed simulation based study , considering different network topologies .    </S>",
