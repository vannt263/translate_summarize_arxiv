    "theories in which gravity propagates in large extra spacetime dimensions  @xcite have received a great deal of attention during the past several years . these models permit some of the qualitative features of string theory , such as the existence of extra dimensions and stringy resonances  @xcite , to be tested experimentally , and predict the appearance of a wide variety of phenomenology at future high energy colliders  @xcite .",
    "they also furnish a solution to the hierarchy problem by lowering the fundamental planck scale to a tev .",
    "the string theoretic motivation for extra dimensions also allows new dimensions in which standard model ( sm ) or other non - gravitational fields can propagate  @xcite ; for consistency with experimental constraints they must have a size of order an @xmath10 .",
    "models utilizing this idea have been shown to yield a host of interesting phenomena , including tev - scale unification  @xcite , explanations of fermion yukawa hierarchies  @xcite , mechanisms for generating neutrino masses  @xcite , and methods of rendering axions invisible  @xcite .",
    "one proposed scenario , referred to as the universal extra dimensions ( ued ) model  @xcite , allows all the sm fields to propagate in @xmath10 extra dimensions . at tree level ,",
    "the momentum in the extra dimensions is conserved , requiring pair production of the associated kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes at colliders and preventing tree level mixing effects from altering precision electroweak measurements .",
    "the compactification scale of the ued can therefore be as low as 300 gev for one extra dimension , and remains less than 1 tev for two ued .",
    "the phenomenological implications of ued for collider experiments  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite , and the muon anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite have been studied , and new mechanisms for generating neutrino masses  @xcite and suppressing proton decay  @xcite have been developed .",
    "the detection of direct production of ued kk states at future colliders is expected to be difficult , for the following two reasons : ( i ) a remnant of extra - dimensional momentum conservation when loop effects are included implies the existence of a neutral , stable kk mode , leading to the necessity of interpreting missing energy signatures ; ( ii ) the near degeneracy of the kk excitations within each level renders the mass shifts due to radiative corrections important in determining the pattern of decays  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to determine whether there are other , indirect ways in which the effects of ued can be detected .",
    "one such possibility is through the modification of higgs production and decay processes at future colliders ; determining whether such deviations can significantly modify higgs properties is also important considering the necessity of establishing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry - breaking .",
    "we study here the processes @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath12 ; the first interaction is the dominant higgs production mechanism at the lhc , while the second is the primary discovery mode for @xmath13 gev .",
    "all three processes occur at one loop in the sm , the same order at which the kk excitations first contribute ; we expect , and find , that these effects are quite large for the low compactification scales allowed for ued .",
    "furthermore , graviton exchanges do not contribute to these processes at one loop , as can be seen from the unitary gauge feynman rules in  @xcite .",
    "we can therefore with some sense of security neglect the gravitational effects which presumably also appear in the complete theory in which the ued are embedded  @xcite .",
    "we concentrate here on modifications arising from physics in ued , rather than from other extra - dimensional models , for two reasons : ( i ) in the randall - sundrum model  @xcite in which sm fields can propagate in the full 5-dimensional spacetime , higgs physics is already modified at tree - level by the mixing between the higgs and the radion field which stabilizes the extra dimension  @xcite ; ( ii ) in @xmath10 models where only gauge fields propagate in the bulk , we expect the effects to be unobservable , because the bound on the compactification scale from electroweak precision fits is quite high  @xcite and the top quark kk excitations which induce the majority of the effects found here are absent .    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we review the formulation of the sm in one additional ued , focusing on the appropriate gauge - fixing and the mixing within the top quark kk tower .",
    "we study the modifications of the processes @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath12 in sec . 3 ; we find that the heavy kk modes decouple , yielding finite , unambiguous results for one ued . for more than one ued the sums over kk modes diverge , and only qualitative statements can be made .",
    "we find that observable modifications to higgs production and decay processes occur for compactification masses @xmath14 tev ; the @xmath3 production rate is increased by @xmath15 for @xmath16 gev , respectively , while the decay widths are shifted by @xmath7 in the same interval .",

    "this shift is caused primarily by the @xmath234 deviation ; however , it may render this decay mode visible above the background at the lhc .",

    "we have studied the virtual effects of kk excitations in ued on higgs production and decay processes relevant for high energy experiments at the lhc and at future linear colliders .",
    "the heavy kk modes decouple , allowing us to obtain unambiguous predictions for one extra dimension . for two or more extra dimensions",
    "the kk mode sums diverge , and while we expect our results in these scenarios to be qualitatively similar to those obtained here , we can not make precise predictions .",
    "we have found that the kk excitation contributions can be quite significant ; the @xmath235 production rate can be @xmath236 larger than the sm result for @xmath13 gev and kk mass parameter @xmath160 gev , a value allowed by current constraints .",
    "for @xmath237 gev , the rate increase is @xmath165 ; assuming the sm theoretical prediction is under control by the time the lhc turns on , this should be an observable shift .",
    "the corresponding deviations in the @xmath132 decay width can be probed at future @xmath8 colliders , allowing compactification masses in the range @xmath171 gev to be tested .",

    "gev can be probed .",
    "the @xmath128 width can be independently measured at future @xmath8 and @xmath9 colliders ; we expect the effects from compactification masses @xmath200 gev to be observable with the @xmath241 precision expected at @xmath8 colliders , and from masses @xmath171 gev to be testable with the @xmath242 precision expected at @xmath9 colliders .",
    "finally , we have examined the deviations in the decay @xmath12 predicted by ued models .",
    "we have found that the deviations from the sm result are less than @xmath165 throughout the @xmath243 region studied .",
    "however , the process @xmath244 is expected to increase by @xmath245 for compactification masses in the range @xmath246 gev .",
    "no detailed study of this process has been performed for either the lhc or future linear colliders ; however , the production increase at the lhc is possibly visible above background .    how do these results compare with the deviations induced in other new physics models ? in the randall - sundrum model studied in  @xcite , where the higgs and radion fields mix , both @xmath0 and @xmath247 are decreased throughout the allowed parameter space ; the total higgs production rate can be decreased to @xmath248 of the sm value for a large range of higgs - radion mixing strengths .",
    "these results for @xmath0 are the opposite of those found here , in which the width is increased throughout the allowed parameter space .",
    "the situation is murkier in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , as a large number of parameters enter calculations at the one loop level .",
    "a detailed study of higgs physics in the mssm was performed in  @xcite .",
    "typically , @xmath249 is decreased by @xmath250 throughout the allowed parameter space , while @xmath247 is shifted by @xmath251 , with the direction of the shift parameter dependent .",
    "again , the deviation in @xmath0 is opposite that found here .",
    "@xmath0 was also studied in  @xcite within a supersymmetric extra - dimensional scenario  @xcite . in this model",
    ", @xmath0 receives contributions from loops of both top and stop kk excitations ; the localization of fermion yukawa couplings at orbifold fixed points induces mixing within these kk towers .",
    "the width is decreased relative to its sm value throughout the entire parameter space ; for a higgs with @xmath252 gev the width is @xmath253 of the sm result .",
    "this is again opposite the shift found here .",
    "the effects of any of these scenarios on higgs physics should therefore be distinguishable from the shifts found in the ued model studied here ; the direct production of the various new states associated with each model should also assist in distinguishing them .    in summary ,",
    "the virtual effects of kk excitations in ued can significantly alter higgs properties which will be measured at future colliders .",
    "the implications of radiative corrections in extra - dimensional models have not been studied extensively , primarily because of the resulting divergences .",
    "we have shown that in certain scenarios such effects are both calculable and important , and we believe that further investigations along these lines should be undertaken .      it is a pleasure to thank c. anastasiou , j. hewett , k. melnikov , and t. rizzo for many helpful suggestions and conversations .",
