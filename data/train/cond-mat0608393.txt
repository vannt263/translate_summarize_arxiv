    "we have applied the spin wave approximation to this model , have done quantum perturbation theory around trial groundstates , and have studied the -generalisation in the limit of large @xmath1 where the mean - field approximation becomes exact @xcite . here , we report the results of the -symmetric model .",

    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , are the primitive lattice vectors of the net.,width=340 ]",
    "in this section , we sketch the mean field treatment of the generalisation of the model .",
    "the procedure follows closely that of @xcite .",
    "further details can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the first step is the replacement of the @xmath9 invariant product @xmath10 in by the -symmetric expression @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are bosonic operators and @xmath14 is the @xmath15-dimensional generalisaton of the antisymmetric unit tensor in two dimensions @xcite . here",
    ", we have introduced a paired index notation , @xmath16 for the spinor index of the bosonic operators .",
    "the boson occupation numbers @xmath17 are subject to the constraint = n_b/ [ constr ] with @xmath18 a fixed parameter @xcite . for the @xmath19 case , @xmath20",
    ", one has @xmath21 with @xmath2 the spin length . hence ,",
    "large values of @xmath18 , equivalent to large values of @xmath2 in the @xmath19 model , correspond to the classical limit and small values of @xmath18 correspond to the quantum regime .",
    "the next step is a decoupling of the quartic terms in the hamiltonian by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation using fields @xmath22 which are defined on the links of the lattice .",
    "additional fields @xmath23 have to be introduced as lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints on the sites .",
    "we assume that the link variables are identical on all horizontal links of , @xmath24 , and on all diagonal links of , @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that @xmath26 on the a and b sites in , and @xmath27 on the c sites .",
    "now , the bosons can be integrated out exactly . then",
    ", in the large @xmath15 limit , the physical values of the variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are determined by the saddlepoint of the mean field energy = j |q_1|^2 + 2 |q_2|^2 - ( 2 + ) ( + 1 ) + _ , _ ( ) ( 1 + |x_()|^2 ) [ emfk ] with respect to these variables . here , @xmath32 is the number of downward pointing triangles of the lattice .",
    "the spinon frequencies @xmath33 , @xmath34 , are obtained as the three positive solutions of @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the six dimensional matrix related to the bosonic part of the hamiltonian after the hubbard - stratonovich transformation has been performed : ( ) = (    ccc@ccc - & 0 & 0 & 0 & _ 2 ( ) & j _ 1 ( ) + 0 & - & 0 & _ 2 ( ) & 0 & _ 3 ( ) + 0 & 0 & - & j _ 1 ( ) & _ 3 ( ) & 0 + 0 & ^*_2 ( ) & j ^*_1 ( ) & + & 0 & 0 + ^*_2 ( ) & 0 & ^*_3 ( ) & 0 & + & 0 + j ^*_1 ( ) & ^*_3 ( ) & 0 & 0 & 0 & +    ) , [ dp ] with @xmath37 , and @xmath38 in the above formula , the matrix elements @xmath39 incorporate information on the lattice symmetries via the primitive lattice vectors @xmath40 of the net , see , and the wave vector @xmath41 .",
    "the quantity @xmath42 represents the density of bose condensate that will develop at those points in the brillouin zone where one of the spinon frequencies vanishes . by calculating the analog of the spin - spin correlation function",
    ", we can show that the long distance behaviour of this function is directly related to the existence of a condensate @xcite : a finite condensate density , @xmath43 implies long - range order ( lro ) , while for @xmath44 there is only short - range order ( sro ) .    to find the saddle point of @xmath45 , , in the space of the variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath42 at a given pair of parameters @xmath4 , @xmath18 , we use an iterative numerical routine .",
    "remarkably , and in contrast to previous applications of the mean field approach @xcite , it turns out to be indispensable to allow for two independent lagrange multipliers @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in view of the anisotropy of our model",
    "this is plausible .",
    "the results of the large-@xmath1 approach are summarised in the zero temperature phase diagram of the anisotropic antiferromagnet .",
    "it displays the phases that we were able to discern in the @xmath48 plane .",
    "we first note that as expected lro which is always present for large @xmath18 disappears from the incommensurate ( ic ) phase for sufficiently small values of @xmath18 .",
    "recall that for large @xmath18 we are in the classical regime of our model .",
    "the phase boundary that separates the region with sro from the region with lro was found by determining for each value of @xmath4 that value of @xmath18 where the gap in the lowest branch of the one spinon spectrum @xmath49 first vanishes as @xmath50 is increased . at larger values of @xmath18 , condensate , and hence lro",
    "will appear .",
    "since our model is maximally frustrated for @xmath51 , one expects a maximal suppression of lro by quantum effects at this point .",
    "as is seen in , this is confirmed in the large-@xmath1 approach . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the exact quantum ground state of our model is ferrimagnetic ( fm ) according to the lieb - mattis theorem @xcite .",
    "the classical ferrimagnet has all spins on the horizontal lattice lines aligned ferromagnetically while the middle spins are oriented antiparallel to these . in the classical limit , @xmath53 , of our -model , the expectation value @xmath54 , which measures the singlet weight on the horizontal bonds , should vanish in this state for sufficiently small @xmath4 , @xmath55 .",
    "as @xmath4 is increased beyond @xmath56 , @xmath28 increases in the manner of an order parameter at a second order phase transition ( see panel ( a ) of ) . at the same time , the parameter @xmath29 begins to decrease , and it drops to zero at @xmath57 ( see panel ( b ) of ) .",
    "( note that the @xmath4-scales are different in panel ( a ) and panel ( b ) ) .",

    "we display @xmath64 in panel ( c ) of .",
    "for @xmath65 we find @xmath66 which is equivalent to @xmath67 . for @xmath68",
    ", @xmath69 increases with @xmath4 , and it reaches the value @xmath70 at the isotropic point @xmath51 .",
    "there it is independent of the value of @xmath18 in agreement with ref .  @xcite . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the behaviour of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath4 is as expected : it increases monotonously towards @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "however , for @xmath74 , the function @xmath75 develops a minimum at @xmath76 which becomes more pronounced as @xmath18 decreases , _",
    "i.  e. _  as the importance of quantum effects increases .",
    "at present we have no physical explanation for this behaviour of @xmath64 .",
    "the behaviour of the saddlepoint values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath46 and @xmath47 as functions @xmath4 is displayed in panel ( d ) of for various values of @xmath18 . as we have emphasised above , @xmath77 for general anisotropy , @xmath78 .",
    "only at the isotropic point we find @xmath79 in accordance with the expectation .",
    "again , we have no intuitive physical explanation for the behaviour of these parameters as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "quite unexpectedly @xmath47 drops to zero at the boundary @xmath58 of the dc phase .    in the vicinity of the fm - ic and the ic - dc phase boundary , where @xmath28 respectively @xmath29 , are small one can expand @xmath45 , , with respect to these variables and solve the extremum problem analytically .",
    "the expansion reads ( q _ ) = e_0 + r_|q_|^2 + g_|q_|^4 + ( |(q_|^6 ) , [ emf4 ] where @xmath80 for the fm - ic(ic - dc ) phase boundary .",
    "after the stationarity conditions @xmath81 with respect to the variables @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 have been solved the coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 are known as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "our numerical results suggest that @xmath86 .",
    "similarly as in a landau - ginzburg expansion , the fm - ic and the ic - dc phase boundaries are then obtained as the solutions of @xmath87 .",
    "these solutions are presented as solid lines in . obviously , the numerical data agree reasonably well with these analytic solutions .",
    "small discrepancies arise in the numerical data because the energy surface @xmath88 is very shallow in the vicinity of the saddle point . on these boundaries and inside the fm and",
    "the dc phases the values of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and of the ordering wave vector remain constant as is shown in the corresponding panels of . using a similar expansion technique for the -analog of the spin - spin correlation function ,",
    "we have also been able to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of this function on the phase boundaries analytically .",
    "we find that there is indeed lro along the entire phase boundaries up to arbitarily small values of @xmath18 .",
    "however , while along the fm - ic phase boundary there is lro between any pair of spins @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , along the ic - dc phase boundary , there is lro only between the spins on the c sites @xmath92 , see .    to conclude we wish to compare the results presented here for the anisotropic antiferromagnet ( af ) , , with those obtained by chung et al .",
    "@xcite for the symmetric generalisation of the anisotropic triangular af . with increasing values of @xmath4 , which controls the anisotropy in both models",
    ", we find the same succession of phases as in ref .",
    "@xcite : a collinear phase , an incommensurate phase and a decoupled chain phase . however , while lro disappears for sufficiently small values of @xmath93 for all values of @xmath4 in the triangular af , we find lro in the entire fm phase and along the fm - ic and the ic - dc phase boundaries up to arbitrarily small values of @xmath18 . for both models ,",
    "the mean - field approach predicts a dc phase which , however , is certainly not described faithfully by this approach .",
    "qualitative consideration of the role of fluctuations in this phase lead the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to the conclusion that there is spin peierls order in the dc regime of the anisotropic triangular af .",
    "such a picture is still elusive for the anisotropic af .",
    "however , by applying perturbation theory to the trimerised version of the model , i.  e.  to a model for which the couplings on e.  g.  the upward pointing triangles are uniformly weaker than those on the downward pointing triangles @xcite , we find that for @xmath94 the dynamics of the c spins of our model , see , is effectively described by the hamiltonian of the anisotropic triangular af with strong coupling in one of the three lattice directions .",
    "therefore , according to the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite there should be spin peierls order between these spins . since , on account of the trimerisation , the spins on the @xmath95 and @xmath96 sites in",
    "are already paired in nearest neighbour singlet pairs , one may thus speculate that spin peierls order also prevails in the dc phase of the anisotropic af .",
