    "a direct test of the time - reversal symmetry in a single experiment is of great interest among possible ways to probe the @xmath1 symmetry violation@xcite . for particles with spin 0 such as pseudo - scalar mesons ,",
    "a direct test may be obtained by observation of an asymmetry between a reaction from state _",
    "i _ to state _ f _ and a reversed reaction @xmath4 .",
    "while the cplear experiment measured a nonzero value of the kabir asymmetry in neutral kaon oscillations@xcite , a controversy was raised as to whether this result was independent of @xmath0 violation as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions are connected by both the @xmath1 and @xmath0 symmetries .",
    "therefore , an idea was proposed to exploit the quantum correlations of neutral b and k meson pairs to observe reversible transitions between flavour and @xmath0-definite states of the mesons@xcite .",
    "such a @xmath1 symmetry test was successfully performed by the babar experiment with the entangled neutral b meson system@xcite . in turn , the kloe-2 detector at the da@xmath7ne @xmath8-factory is capable of performing a statistically significant direct observation of @xmath1 symmetry violation with neutral kaons independently of @xmath0 violation@xcite .",
    "neutral kaon states may be described in a number of bases including flavour - definite states : @xmath9 as well as the states with definite @xmath0 parity : @xmath10\\qquad \\mathcal{cp}=+1,\\\\    \\ket{{\\mathrm{k_{- } } } } & = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left[\\ket{{\\mathrm{k}^0}}-\\ket{{{\\overline{\\mathrm{k}^0}}}}\\right]\\qquad \\mathcal{cp}=-1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] state of the kaon can be identified at the moment of decay through observation of the decay final state . with the assumption of @xmath11 rule rule",
    "is well tested in semileptonic kaon decays@xcite ] , semileptonic kaon decays with positively and negatively charged leptons ( later denoted as @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) unambiguously identify the decaying state as @xmath14 and @xmath15 respectively .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0-definite states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are implied by decays to hadronic final states with respectively two and three pions ( denoted @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . in order to observe a transition between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 states , both the _ in _ and _ out _ states must be identified in the respective basis .",
    "this is uniquely possible in the entangled system of neutral k mesons produced at a @xmath8-factory . due to conservation of @xmath22 quantum numbers , the @xmath23 decay yields an anti - symmetric non - strange final state of the form : @xmath24 which exhibits quantum entanglement between the two kaons in the epr sense@xcite .",
    "thus , at the moment of decay of first of the k mesons ( and , consequently , identification of its state ) state of the partner kaon is immediately known to be orthogonal .",
    "this property allows for identification of state of the still - living kaon only by observing the decay of its partner .",
    "its state can be then measured at the moment of decay after time  @xmath25 , possibly leading to observation of a transition between strangeness and cp - definite states .",
    "a list of all possible transitions is presented in table [ ag : tab : states ] .",
    "it is immediately visible that time - reversal conjugates of these transitions are not identical with neither their cp- nor cpt - conjugates which is crucial for independence of the test .",
    ".possible transitions between flavour and cp - definite states and their time - reversal conjugates . for each transition a time - ordered pair of decay products which identifies the respective states is given . [ cols=\">,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for each of the transitions from table [ ag : tab : states ] occurring in time @xmath25 and its time - reversal conjugate a time - dependent ratio of probabilities can be defined as an observable of the @xmath1 symmetry test . in the region",
    "where high statistics is expected at kloe-2 , however , two of them are important for the test : @xmath26}{p[{\\mathrm{k_{-}}}(0 ) \\to { \\mathrm{k}^0}(\\delta t ) ] } } \\ ; \\sim \\ ; \\frac{\\mathrm{i}(\\ell^-,3\\pi^0;\\delta t)}{\\mathrm{i}(\\pi\\pi,\\ell^+;\\delta t ) } , \\\\    { r_4(\\delta t ) } & = { \\frac{p[{{\\overline{\\mathrm{k}^0}}}(0 ) \\to { \\mathrm{k_{-}}}(\\delta t)]}{p[{\\mathrm{k_{-}}}(0 ) \\to { { \\overline{\\mathrm{k}^0}}}(\\delta t ) ] } } \\ ; \\sim \\ ; \\frac{\\mathrm{i}(\\ell^+,3\\pi^0;\\delta t)}{\\mathrm{i}(\\pi\\pi,\\ell^-;\\delta t)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these quantities can be measured experimentally through numbers of events with certain pairs of decays occurring in time difference @xmath25 . a deviation of these ratios from 1 would be an indication of @xmath1 symmetry violation .",
    "have simulated the behaviour of these ratios expected at kloe-2 for 10@xmath27 of data@xcite ( figure [ ag : fig : ratios ] ) . at kloe-2 the asymptotic region of @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be observed where their theoretical behaviour may be expressed as : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a t - violating parameter@xcite .     of kloe-2 data .",
    "the figure was adapted from@xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the @xmath1 symmetry test requires reconstruction of the processes with @xmath32 and @xmath33 pairs of decays .",
    "while for @xmath34 the @xmath35 final state can be chosen to take advantage of good vertex and momentum reconstruction from charged pion tracks in the kloe drift chamber , the @xmath36 decay reconstruction is a challenging task .",
    "this process only involves neutral particles resulting in the calorimeter clusters from six @xmath37 hits being the only recorded information .",
    "moreover , this decay has to be reconstructed in cases where the partner @xmath38 decays semileptonically and the missing neutrino prevents the use of kinematic constraints to aid @xmath39 reconstruction .",
    "therefore , this process requires independent reconstruction .",
    "the aim of the new reconstruction method is to obtain the spatial coordinates and time of the @xmath41 decay point by only using information on electromagnetic calorimeter clusters created by @xmath37 hits from @xmath40 .",
    "information available for @xmath42-th cluster includes its spatial location and recording time @xmath43 .",
    "the problem of localizing the vertex is then in its principle similar to gps positioning and can be solved in a similar manner .",
