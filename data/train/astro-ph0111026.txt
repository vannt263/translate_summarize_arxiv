    "cb26 ( l1439 ) is a small cometary - shaped bok globule located @xmath110  north of the taurus / auriga dark cloud .",
    "launhardt & henning ( 1997 ) suggested a distance of 300pc . from a re - examination of the larger - scale velocity structure ( ungerechts & thaddeus 1987 ) ,",
    "we believe it is part of the taurus / auriga complex at 140pc . single - dish submm images at 10  resolution show strong unresolved dust continuum emission at the south - west rim of the globule , surrounded by a thin asymmetric envelope with a well - ordered magnetic field directed along pa@xmath125   ( henning et al . 2001 ) . a small bipolar near - infrared ( nir )",
    "nebula bisected by a dark extinction lane is associated with the millimeter emission .",
    "the sub - arcsecond resolution nir polarization pattern is consistent with the presence of an almost edge - on circumstellar disk elongated along the extinction lane at pa@xmath160  and a thin envelope ( stecklum et al .",
    "the spectral energy distribution indicates a low - mass , @xmath40.5l@xmath2   pre - main sequence ( pms ) star surrounded by a disk and an envelope ( stecklum et al .",
    "2001 ) , i.e. , a classi object ( adams , lada , & shu 1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1995 ) .",
    "cb26 was observed with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter - wave array between january and december 2000 .",
    "three configurations of the six 10.4 m antennas provided baselines in the range 6180k@xmath5  at 2.7 mm ( 110ghz ) and 12400k@xmath5  at 1.3 mm ( 232ghz ) .",
    "average ssb system temperatures of the sis receivers were 300400k at 110ghz and 300600k at 236ghz .",
    "the digital correlator was centered on the @xmath0co(10 ) line at 110.2ghz , adopting the systemic velocity of cb26 , @xmath6kms@xmath7 ; spectral resolution and bandwidth were 0.17kms@xmath7  and 5kms@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "continuum emission at 1.3 and 2.7 mm was observed simultaneously in 2ghz - wide bands , except in the highest - resolution configuration , where the 4ghz wide - band capability of new 1 mm receivers was used .",
    "amplitude and phase calibration relied on frequent observations of a nearby quasar , resulting in absolute position uncertainty of 02 .",
    "flux densities are based on observations of uranus and neptune , with resulting uncertainties of 20% .",
    "the raw data were calibrated and edited using the mma software package ( scoville et al .",
    "mapping and data analysis used the miriad toolbox ( sault , theuben , & wright 1995 ) .",
    "we also applied maximum entropy deconvolution ( mem ) to the data and obtained images which are very similar to those obtained by standard cleaning .",
    "in fig . [ fig_mmcres ] , our dust continuum images of cb26 show a source elongated along pa=@xmath8 . at 2.7 mm ,",
    "the projected length derived from the distribution of clean components is 230@xmath930au .",
    "the minor axis is unresolved and there is no hint of an envelope .",
    "by contrast , the 1.3 mm images show a narrow central structure of length 400@xmath940au and a small envelope of size 220au@xmath10280au .",
    "the scale height @xmath11  of the central structure remains unresolved , i.e. , @xmath11@xmath1220au .",
    "beyond radii of 120au , an almost symmetric 20  warp is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig_mmcres]d .",
    "total continuum flux densities are 22@xmath94mjy and 150@xmath930mjy at 2.7 and 1.3 mm , respectively .",
    "thus , we recover completely the 1.3 mm flux of the unresolved component as measured with the iram 30-m telescope , 160mjy ( launhardt & henning 1997 ) . from our maps",
    ", we calculate that about 50mjy arises in the envelope and 100mjy in the narrow central structure . of this 100mjy ,",
    "about 75mjy derives from the inner 230au where the 3 mm emission arises .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_jmh ] , the 1.3 mm continuum mem image is overlaid on a map of the nir reflection nebula . within the nir astrometric uncertainties , 05 , the dust emission coincides with the extinction lane and with the location and orientation of the disk postulated by stecklum et al .",
    "our kinematic data support the disk hypothesis . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_cores]a , strong @xmath0co(10 ) emission ( @xmath13k ) arises mainly from the outer parts of the disk , suggesting optically thick emission . in fig .",
    "[ fig_cores]b , the @xmath0co line is clearly double - peaked , with blue - shifted emission concentrated to the north - east and red - shifted to the south - west .",
    "the velocity structure indicates a rotation axis perpendicular to the projected plane of the disk . at the systemic velocity ,",
    "@xmath14kms@xmath7 , gas emission appears to be self - absorbed , probably due to the extended outer envelope .",
    "our millimeter interferometric observations of thermal dust continuum and @xmath0co line emission from cb26 confirm the presence of an edge - on circumstellar disk as postulated by stecklum et al .",
    "the disk has a diameter of about 400au and an as yet unexplained warp beyond radii of 120au .",
    "this could be due to an undetected wide companion star with an inclined orbit .",
    "the continuum fluxes lead to an average 1.3 - 3 mm dust emission spectral index @xmath15  for the inner @xmath16@xmath17115au of the disk of 1.7@xmath90.2 , where flux @xmath18 . since @xmath15=2 for a blackbody in the rayleigh - jeans limit , emission from the inner disk must be very optically thick , making it difficult to constrain the mass . beyond 120au ,",
    "no 3 mm emission is detectable and @xmath15@xmath42.7@xmath90.3 , suggesting optically thin emission .",
    "the transition between optically thick and optically thin emission occurs approximately at the radius where a warp appears , @xmath1120au . thus the outer disk may be disturbed and inflated , and flared t tauri star ( tts ) disk models",
    "may no longer apply .",
    "nevertheless we derived a lower limit to the disk mass by comparing the 1.3 and 2.7 mm continuum emission to spatially resolved radiative transfer calculations of different heuristic typical tts disk models characterized by temperature profiles , @xmath19 , with @xmath20=0.50.75 , surface density profiles , @xmath21 , with @xmath22=1.01.5 , and disk flaring , @xmath23 , with @xmath24=01.5 ( e.g. , adams et al .",
    "1987 ; kenyon & hartmann 1987 ) . an interstellar gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 and typical disk dust opacity @xmath25=2@xmath26g@xmath7  with @xmath27  and @xmath28   were assumed ( cf .",
    "beckwith et al .",
    "all models suggest disk masses of at least 0.1m@xmath2 . due to the high optical depths of the @xmath0co line , self - absorption , and possible",
    "depletion ( cf .",
    "thi et al . 2001 ) , an independent mass estimate from the molecular line emission is unobtainable .",
    "the envelope detected in the 1.3 mm images ( figs .",
    "[ fig_mmcres]b , [ fig_mmcres]d ) is probably associated with an outflow or disk wind .",
    "assuming optically thin emission at temperature 30k and @xmath29@xmath26g@xmath7 , a fairly typical value for dense protostellar cores ( cf . ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) , we derive @xmath30m@xmath2 .",
    "for a cylindrical morphology ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig_mmcres]b , [ fig_mmcres]d , and sect . [ sec_res ] ) , we infer an average density @xmath31@xmath32 , column density @xmath33@xmath34 , and corresponding visual extinction @xmath35mag , implying that back - warming from the envelope has to be considered in the energy balance of the disk ( cf .",
    "butner , natta , & evans 1994 ) .",
    "the total mass of the more extended ( @xmath36au diameter ) asymmetric envelope seen in single - dish maps is @xmath37m@xmath2  ( henning et al .",
    "this may be a remnant of the globule core from which the system formed .",
    "the velocity structure of @xmath0co can be modeled by keplerian rotation when the high optical depth of the inner disk and self - absorption due to an extended envelope are taken into account , yielding a mass of the central star of 0.35@xmath90.1m@xmath2  ( cf .",
    "[ fig_cores]b ) .",
    "however , since the disk mass ( @xmath40.1m@xmath2 ) is comparable to the inferred mass of the central star , self - gravitation may be important in the outer disk ( cf .",
    "bertin & lodato 1999 ) . the outer rotation curve would then be flatter than in the pure keplerian case , and the mass of the central star concomitantly lower , perhaps only 0.25m@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0co line strength suggests a gas - rich disk with kinetic temperature @xmath420k outside @xmath38au .",
    "an upper limit to the turbulent velocity dispersion in the disk is 0.3kms@xmath7 .",
    "pms evolutionary tracks indicate an age of @xmath39yr for a 0.3m@xmath2  star with @xmath40l@xmath2  ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) . due to the anisotropic radiation field caused by the optically thick edge - on disk ,",
    "0.5l@xmath2  may be only a lower limit to the bolometric luminosity of the central star ( see menshchikov & henning 1999 ) .",
    "but , for such a massive disk , the intrinsic viscous luminosity could also contribute .",
    "overall , the properties of the cb26 system are consistent with its being younger than classical ttss ( ages @xmath41yr ) .",
    "there is no dense , centrally peaked cloud core with evidence of collapse , and no prominent molecular outflow , indicating that the main accretion phase , assumed to last a few times @xmath42yr ( e.g. , andr , ward - thompson , & barsony 2000 ) , has ended .",
    "however , the disk mass is close to the theoretical gravitationally unstable limit , 0.3m@xmath43 , so that the envelope may still be accreting at low rates onto the disk ( see hollenbach , yorke , & johnstone 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig_cores]b shows some forbidden red - shifted emission from the blue side of the disk which may be due to infall .",
    "we conclude that the cb26 disk surrounds a pms m - type star with age @xmath1@xmath44yr .",
    "this represents an intermediate stage between such deeply embedded protostellar accretion disks as l1551irs5 ( e.g. , butner et al .",
    "1994 ) , and the more evolved , perhaps protoplanetary , disks around classical ttss , which may be the reservoirs for material for planet formation .",
