    "in this paper we study the complementary case when the _ infinite _ bosonic system is initially prepared in the schrdinger cat state . for a finite bosonic system",
    "such a state is defined as a superposition of two coherent states with the same amplitudes but with phases shifted by @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "here we generalize this notion to the case of infinite dimensional systems composed of bath and system dynamics .",
    "we show that the reduced dynamics of the qubit depends on a specific choice of the initial schrdinger cat state .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the situation when the initial state is purely coherent .",
    "it holds true not only for purity and coherence of a single qubit but also for entanglement of a two  qubit system .    due to the decoherence phenomenon ,",
    "the assumed initial state of an infinite bosonic bath is inaccessible in the present experiments .",
    "however , the development of experimental techniques allows one to manipulate and control systems devised from an increasing number of particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , the results presented in this paper may serve as a starting point for understanding of qubits coupled to large bosonic systems prepared in a desired quantum state .",
    "our choice of the initial state is motivated by the fact that multiple schrdinger cat states can accurately approximate any quantum state @xcite .",

    "the hamiltonian of such a composite system thus reads : @xmath81\\otimes { \\mathbb{i}}_{q}+h_{q } ,     \\\\",

    "several useful measures have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one of the operational measures is the negativity , defined by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are the negative eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix of two qubits @xcite . for the model under consideration the negativity",
    "can straightforwardly be evaluated for an arbitrary evolution time @xmath86 .",
    "one obtains @xmath87 the negativity is positive for an entangled mixed state , whereas it vanishes for unentangled states .",
    "moreover , it presents an entanglement monotone and can be used to quantify the degree of entanglement .",
    "the main quantifiers like the purity ( [ pur ] ) , the coherence factor ( [ coh ] ) or the negativity ( [ neg ] ) depend directly on the dephasing function @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , we start with discussing its properties in further detail .",
    "the dephasing function depends on the qubit  environment coupling via the functions @xmath88 and @xmath69 .",
    "the latter one defines the initial schrdinger cat state . for convenience",
    ", we can assume that both functions are real .",
    "we also introduce the new function @xmath89 . then , the comparison of the function @xmath90 ( see eq .",
    "( [ a0 ] ) ) with the standard expression for the decoherence function ( see e.g. eq . ( 4.51 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , allows one to identify @xmath91 as the spectral density . in the literature , there are several examples of @xmath91 in use .",
    "a frequently used one is the generalized drude form defined by @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 is the cut - off frequency .",
    "the case @xmath95 corresponds to a sub - ohmic , @xmath96 to the conventional ohmic and @xmath97 to a super - ohmic environment .",
    "one can observe that the long - time limit is given by @xmath98 the integral in this expression is infinite for a sub - ohmic and an ohmic environment .",
    "then @xmath99 and the dephasing function diminishes to zero , @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , the purity ( [ pur ] ) , coherence factor ( [ coh ] ) and negativity ( [ neg ] ) asymptotically take on the following asymptotic long - time values @xmath101 one can see that for the sub - ohmic and ohmic environments all the quantifiers are independent of any particular choice of @xmath102 .",
    "it means that in the long  time regime the qubit properties do not depend any longer on the initial schrdinger cat state .",
    "the super - ohmic case is more intriguing because @xmath103 . as it follows from the expression for the normalization constant @xmath104 ( see eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) ) , the function @xmath69 is square  integrable . starting from the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality one can find that also the integrals in ( [ a ] ) and ( [ apm ] ) exist , are finite and their values depend on the function @xmath69 . in consequence ,",
    "the dephasing function depends on both @xmath105 and @xmath64 , i.e. on the initial state of the environment .",
    "therefore all characteristics ( [ pur ] ) , ( [ coh ] ) and ( [ neg ] ) do depend on the initial environment state , provided the environment is _ super - ohmic_.    it is instructive to compare eq .",
    "( [ acat ] ) with the dephasing function obtained for an initial , purely coherent state @xmath106 of the environment . in this case",
    "the dephasing function @xmath67 becomes @xmath107   a_0(t).\\ ] ] in clear contrast to the initial schrdinger cat state , @xmath108 now depends only on @xmath90 .",
    "this fact implies that the purity ( [ pur ] ) , the coherence factor ( [ coh ] ) and the negativity ( [ neg ] ) are independent of the initial state of the environment also for a super  ohmic bath .",
    "dephasing characteristics of qubits coupled to a bosonic environment and prepared in a schrdinger cat state has been investigated .",
    "the properties of the reduced dynamics , as reflected in the purity and coherence factor , have been shown to exhibit an explicit phase - dependence @xmath64 as a parameter of the schrdinger cat state .",
    "qualitatively the same behavior has been obtained for the entanglement feature , being quantified by the negativity .",
    "the main conclusion is the following : if the initial state of the environment is the coherent ( or vacuum ) state then the informational quantifiers do not depend on the initial state .",
    "however , if the initial state is a linear combination of two coherent states as the schrdinger cat state then such quantifiers as the purity , coherence factor or the negativity do depend on the initial state ,  via the function @xmath105 and the phase @xmath64  , of the environment , at least in the short - to - intermediate time regime .",
    "for the super - ohmic environment this result holds true also in the long  time limit .",
    "moreover , the @xmath64-dependence allows one to selectively control the dephasing characteristics and the entanglement characteristics .",
