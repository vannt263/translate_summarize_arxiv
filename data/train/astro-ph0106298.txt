    "we have assumed as reference bandpasses for the filters of the optical - nir camera the standard @xmath9 set commonly used on hst with wfpc2 ( @xmath21 ) or nicmos ( @xmath22 ) and from the ground ( fig .",

    "details about the filter properties are given in table  [ tbl : filters ]    the actual choice of the filters to be used in space with ngst may be different but the arguments developed in the following do not depend critically on this detail .",
    "to simulate a range of galaxy seds we have adopted the templates of @xcite for a typical elliptical , sbc , scd and irregular galaxy plus a gissel @xcite template for a very blue galaxy ( with a constant star formation rate and an age of 0.1 gyr ) .",

    "it is straightforward to identify star - forming galaxies with @xmath5 and ellipticals at @xmath6 .",
    "the lower panel shows the same in a @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 plane and demonstrates how , without optical bands , it becomes difficult to isolate star - forming galaxies at @xmath32 .",
    "in order to quantify the different performance of different sets of filters and the effects of `` red - leaks '' in a filter configuration extending from the visible to the infrared we have carried out simulations of the assignment of photometric redshifts to a sample of faint galaxies . to this end",
    ", we have tried to generate a simulated photometric catalog covering a very large range of galaxy spectral properties and to estimate photometric redshifts from an economic and independent a set of templates as possible .",
    "galaxies were simulated in a redshift interval @xmath33 according to gissel library .",
    "this spectral synthesis model is controlled by a number of free parameters .",
    "the star formation rate for a galaxy at a given age is governed by the assumed @xmath34 star formation time - scale @xmath35 .",
    "several values of @xmath35 and galaxy ages are necessary to reproduce the different observed spectral types .",
    "for the shape of the initial mass function ( imf ) we have assumed a salpeter law , which turns out not to be a critical choice . in addition to the gissel parameterization , we have added the internal reddening of each galaxy by applying the observed attenuation law for local starburst galaxies by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , with the @xmath36 normalization varying between 0 and 0.2 mag .",
    "we have also included the lyman absorption produced by the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift .",

    "have been derived using a standard procedure of @xmath39 optimization , comparing the observed fluxes with errors to the extended cww set of templates described in sect .",

    "the template fluxes have been normalized to the observed ones with the factor @xmath45 minimizing the @xmath39 value : @xmath46   /   \\sum_i \\left [ { f_{template , i}^2 \\over \\sigma_i^2 } \\right]\\ ] ]    fig .",
    "[ fig_optir29 ]  shows the comparison between photometric redshift estimates obtained with a @xmath47 @xmath48 filter set and a filter set limited to the infrared bands .",
    "as suggested in the previous section in order to correctly identify star forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 and avoid confusion with other seds it appears mandatory to have , besides the ir filters , photometric information in the optical bands . in the following",
    "we will adopt the set @xmath9 as standard .    in order to explore the effects of filter leaks",
    "the following approach was adopted :    1 .",
    "two types of leaks have been foreseen : a constant leak at a level of @xmath7 of the peak transmission over the whole spectral range and a leak of gaussian shape placed at 1.5 times the effective wavelength of the filter with an amplitude of @xmath8 of the peak transmission and a width of 5% of the central wavelength .",
    "the effect of gaussian leaks on the filter transmission is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_filter_gl ] 2 .",
    "the leaks have been included in the system spectral response and new magnitudes and colors have been produced with the gissel models .",
    "the new colors have been used to produce photometric redshifts with the extended cww templates .",
    "no knowledge of the leaks was used in this step , i.e. the system responses assumed in the z - phot estimation are those of fig .",
    "[ fig_filters ] , without leaks .",
    "the typical errors deriving from photometric uncertainties and unaccounted leaks are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_zphot_v_cl28]-[fig_zphot_v_cl30 ] and [ fig_zphot_v_gl28]-[fig_zphot_v_gl30 ] .",
    "the dot - dashed , long - dashed , short - dashed and continuous lines correspond to the 95 , 90 , 68 and 50 percentile of the absolute deviation @xmath49 , respectively . it can be seen that errors are in all cases relatively large at @xmath50 .",
    "this is an obvious effect due to the lack of bandpasses bluer than @xmath51 , and the consequent difficulty to identify the lyman break at relatively low redshift and distinguish it , for example , from the 4000   break at lower redshift .",
    "the effect of the leaks , despite the rather pessimistic assumptions , is in general a moderate increase of the error level .",
    "for example for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the 68 percentile corresponds to @xmath54 with the standard photometric errors , while it increases at @xmath55 with the unaccounted constant leak at a level of @xmath7 of the peak transmission over the whole spectral range .",
    "no qualitative change of the accuracy is observed when the leaks are introduced .",
    "no relevant difference is also found between the continuous and the gaussian leak cases .",
    "again for @xmath52 and @xmath53 the 68 percentile corresponds to @xmath56 when the leak of gaussian shape is added . in the range",
    "@xmath11 a rather good accuracy is achieved with a typical error @xmath12 in all cases down to @xmath57 .",
    "the situation deteriorates slightly around @xmath58 , but the result is due mainly to the insufficient sampling of the seds between the @xmath59 and the @xmath60 filters , in particular to the `` hole '' at 2.9 @xmath61 m .    the importance of the leaks , relative to the uncertainty due to photometric errors , decreases with decreasing flux . at @xmath53 and @xmath52 @xmath62 for the no - leak , constant - leak and gaussian leak case ,",
    "a detailed analysis of ngst multiband photometry applied to the reference case of the study of high - redshift galaxies has been carried out with simulations based on galaxy seds derived from the currently available empirical and model templates and on plausible standard filter - sets .    in order to correctly identify star forming galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 and early - type galaxies above @xmath1 and avoid confusion with other seds",
    "it is mandatory to have photometric information in optical bands , besides a standard ir set like @xmath2 . in particular by adding the @xmath3 and @xmath4 filters a good discrimination is obtained above @xmath5 for star forming galaxies and @xmath6 for early - types .",
    "the case for an extension of the ngst wavelength domain to the optical range is therefore strongly supported by this analysis .",
    "the effects of leaks in the filter blocking have also been investigated . in spite of rather pessimistic assumptions",
    "( a constant leak at a level of @xmath7 of the peak transmission over the whole spectral range or a leak of gaussian shape placed at 1.5 times the effective wavelength of the filter with an amplitude of @xmath8 of the peak transmission and a width of 5% of the central wavelength ) the effects are not dramatic : the accuracy of the determination of photometric redshifts with a standard @xmath9 filter set is not significantly deteriorated for a sample limited to @xmath63 . in the range",
    "@xmath11 a rather good accuracy a typical error @xmath12 is achieved .    as standard specifications for leaks are @xmath64 and as any larger leaks could be measured once the filters are produced , it does not look as though leaks constitute a serious problem , at least for the particular application described here .",
    "the interpretation of fields containing highly reddened sources may , however , be more seriously compromised . extended and continuous spectral coverage appears to be the driving factor to maximize the scientific output of the ngst camera .",
