    "however , the reconnection process is incompletely understood , and detailed observations of individual flares reveal a diversity of effects which are often secondary phenomena , providing only indirect information on the underlying flare mechanism @xcite .",
    "the statistics of solar flare occurrence have been examined in an attempt to provide insight into the flare phenomenon , and also to improve flare prediction .",
    "two statistical distributions of interest are the flare frequency - size distribution , and the waiting - time distribution .",

    "few exceptions to this simple power - law distribution have been reported [ see however ] , although an upper rollover or cut - off is required on energetics grounds @xcite .",
    "the waiting - time distribution is the distribution @xmath6 of times @xmath7 between flare events . for individual active regions the waiting - time distribution",
    "is often observed to be consistent with a simple exponential : @xmath8 where @xmath4 is the mean rate of events of events defined by equation  ( [ eq : freq_size ] ) .",
    "this model corresponds to flares occurring as independent random events at a constant mean rate , i.e.  as a poisson process in time @xcite .",
    "however , the mean rate of flaring in active regions is often observed to vary , in which case a piecewise - constant poisson model may be appropriate .",
    "the model waiting - time distribution is then a sum of exponentials corresponding to distinct intervals with different rates @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of events with size larger than @xmath5 corresponding to a rate @xmath11 and an interval @xmath12 , and where @xmath13 is the total number of events .",
    "a power - law tail is observed in the combined waiting - time distribution for events from multiple active regions over longer periods of time on the sun @xcite , which also may be accounted for by the time - dependent poisson model @xcite , although some authors have argued for a non - poisson interpretation @xcite .",
    "recently demonstrated that a variety of observations for the longer - term waiting - time distribution are consistent with poisson occurrence in time according to a simple functional form for the distribution of rates in time , which is a variant of the rate distribution presented in .",
    "to illustrate these ideas we consider two active regions : us national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) active region ar 10486 , from october - november 2003 , and noaa ar 11029 , from october - november 2009 .",
    "the data used are the soft x - ray event lists compiled by the us space weather prediction center ( swpc ) .",

    "the middle panel in figure  [ fig : dists_ar11029 ] plots the cumulative peak - flux distribution for the flares in ar 11029 , and is suggestive of a rollover around @xmath25 . applied bayesian model comparison to show that a power - law plus upper rollover model is much more probable for this data set than a simple power - law model , and argued that the departure from a power law may reflect the finite storage of magnetic energy in this ( small ) region .",
    "time variation in mean flaring rate is commonly observed in active regions @xcite , and is often associated , as in the case of active region ar 11029 , with a change in the photospheric magnetic complexity of a region @xcite .",

    "it is plausible that the more interesting statistics observed for ar 11029 , by comparison with ar 10486 ( figure  [ fig : dists_ar10486 ] ) are related to the smaller physical smaller size of the region , which may make the coronal magnetic field configuration more sensitive to change .",

    "most of the models are motivated either by accounting for energy balance in an active region @xcite or by explaining the power law in the frequency - size distribution using self - organized criticality / cellular automata ( ` avalanche ' models ) @xcite , although the two pictures are not mutually exclusive .",
    "the avalanche model produces a power - law frequency - size distribution below an upper rollover set by the size of the cellular automata @xcite , and has an exponential ( poisson ) waiting - time distribution , if the system is subject to a constant mean rate of driving @xcite , but may produce other waiting - time distributions with time - dependent driving @xcite .",
    "energy balance models are designed to explain the power - law frequency - energy distribution , and generally assume poisson flare occurrence , but simple models in which active region energy is completely removed by a flare imply a relationship between waiting times and energy , which is not observed @xcite .",
    "a generalized energy - balance formalism ( a ` jump - transition model ' ) which avoids this problem was introduced by , and further developed in and .",
    "the jump - transition model is applied in this paper .    the general jump - transition model @xcite describes the magnetic free energy @xmath28 of an active region at time @xmath29 in terms of secular energy input at a rate @xmath30 , and stochastic transitions downwards in energy ( flares ) at a rate @xmath31 per unit time and per unit energy for transitions from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "the model may be presented either in terms of an integro - partial differential equation describing the probability distribution @xmath34 for the energy @xcite , called a ` master equation ' @xcite , or in terms of a stochastic differential equation describing the time evolution of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "modeling using the jump - transition formalism to date has considered only time - independent cases , namely a time- and energy - independent rate of energy input : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant , and time - independent power - law distributed flare transitions multiplying the transition rates given by equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_wg98 ] ) , but the results suggested that equation  ( [ eq : pl_alpha_wg98 ] ) is the preferred model . ] : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a constant , @xmath39 is a low - energy cutoff , @xmath40 denotes the step function , and @xmath41 is the observed power - law index in the flare frequency - energy distribution @xcite .",

    "time variation is incorporated in the model for two simple cases : 1 .  a step change in a coefficient @xmath72 describing the rates of flaring ; and 2 .  a step change in a coefficient @xmath81 describing the mean rate of energy of the system .",

    "the simulations confirm the analytic arguments for the behavior of the model . the observed soft x - ray flare frequency - peak flux distribution for this active region showed evidence for an upper rollover @xcite , which was interpreted in terms of the finite amount of energy available for flaring in a small active region being depleted by an interval of very rapid flare production .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the the jump - transition model , and the rollover is qualitatively reproduced in the simulations presented here .",
    "a double exponential waiting - time distribution is obtained in the simulations which mimics that observed for solar active region ar 11029 .",
    "a quantitative comparison of data such as that for active region ar 11029 with the jump transition model requires estimation of flare energies , and active region energies , from the data",
    ". however , soft x - ray peak fluxes are indicative only of flare energy , and we are currently unable to reliably estimate the magnetic free energy of a solar active region [ see e.g.   for an attempt to obtain energy estimates for one active region via magnetic field modeling ] .",
    "nevertheless , in future work we will consider more detailed comparison of the model with observational data .",
    "an interesting aspect of the jump - transition model in this context is the model prediction of a departure from poisson waiting - time statistics , if the system energy becomes sufficiently small , because large events are prevented from occurring , which reduces the overall mean rate of events .",
    "this can lead to departure from an exponential waiting - time distribution , even in the time - independent case @xcite .",
    "however , the simulations presented here reveal a new effect .",
    "if the system mean energy has intermediate values , the overall rate of events is reduced by comparison with that for a system with a large mean energy , but the waiting - time distribution remains approximately exponential .",
    "hence the waiting - time distribution may remain exponential even when there is detailed departure from poisson statistics .",
    "this effect was not noticed in previous modeling @xcite , and also warrants further investigation .",
    "the soft x - ray events in ar 11029 appeared to follow poisson occurrence in time based on agreement between the waiting - time distribution and the poisson model @xcite .",
    "however , the us swpc event data suffer from significant event detection and selection problems due to the large and time varying soft x - ray background [ discussed , for example , in ] .",
    "comparison with more sensitive data may be required to reveal detailed departure from poisson occurrence .",
    "the advent of new high resolution and high cadence short - wavelength observations of the sun by the advanced imaging assembly ( aia ) on the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) should enable improved investigations of solar flare event statistics , and more careful comparison with flare statistics models such as the one in this paper .",
    "the results may provide new insights into the mechanisms of energy storage and release underlying the flare phenomenon .",
