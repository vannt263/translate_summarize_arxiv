    "important non perturbative aspects of strong interactions can be studied using the so called ads / qcd phenomenological models .",
    "these models are inspired in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite , which is a duality between string theory and superconformal gauge theories at large t hooft coupling .",
    "the form of this correspondence that is more relevant in studying hadronic physics , relates string theory in @xmath0 space to a superconformal gauge theory on the four dimensional boundary .",
    "one of the simplest ads / qcd models , the hard wall model , consists in the introduction of a hard cut off in anti - de sitter ( ads ) space in order to break conformal invariance .",
    "the position of the cut off represents an infrared mass scale for the gauge theory .",
    "this model makes it possible to reproduce the scaling of hadronic elastic scattering amplitudes at fixed angles from string theory in ads space @xcite .",
    "string theory predictions in flat space were in contrast to the experimentally observed behavior of hadronic scattering at high energies .",
    "this scaling was also obtained @xcite from a map between bulk and boundary quantum states in ads space with a cut off .",
    "it was also shown that it is possible to calculate hadronic masses using the ads / qcd hard wall model . in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , normalized solutions for fields in ads space are dual to states in the dual boundary gauge theory . using this duality , for the case of glueballs , and the idea of introducing boundary conditions in the ads",
    "infrared cut off , the spectrum of scalar glueballs was found @xcite .",
    "this approach made it possible to find also the glueball regge trajectories and compare them with the pomeron trajectories @xcite .",
    "an alternative ads / qcd model consists of a space with ads metric where there is a constant non uniform dilaton background field . in this model ,",
    "called soft wall , the dilaton acts effectively as a smooth infrared cut off and leads to linear regge trajectories for mesons @xcite .",
    "the soft wall was also used to calculate glueball masses and decay constants @xcite . for a recent review on glueballs",
    "e. g. _ , @xcite .",
    "in the original ads / cft correspondence there are only fields in the adjoint representation of the @xmath1 gauge group .",
    "this happens because , in the case of @xmath0 space , there is a set of @xmath2 colored d3 branes and the boundary fields show up as excitations of open strings attached to these branes . in order to introduce matter fields , that are in the fundamental representation , like quarks",
    ", one can add @xmath3 d7 probe branes in the space @xcite .",
    "in this d3-d7 brane model , open strings with an endpoint on a d3 and the other on a d7 brane have color and flavor .",
    "so , their excitations can include quark like fields . in this model ,",
    "mesons are described by strings with both endpoints on d7 branes , corresponding to d7 brane fluctuations .",
    "masses for mesons in this model were calculated in @xcite .    the ads / qcd models have been used not only to study the mass spectrum but also other important properties that involve non perturbative aspects of qcd , like the description of the hadronic structure . a very important process that gives us informations about the internal structure of hadrons is the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) .",
    "it consists of a scattering of a highly energetic lepton off of a hadron .",
    "this process was investigated using the hard wall model in @xcite .",
    "the matrix element of the four dimensional electromagnetic current of the hadron is mapped into a ten dimensional supergravity interaction action , that holographically describes the scattering process .",
    "this way , the structure functions are calculated .",
    "the description of dis using the soft wall ads / qcd model was presented in @xcite .",
    "the hadronic structure functions found from the hard and soft wall models are different , although they agree at leading order .",
    "this is a non trivial result , since the calculation of the hadronic structure functions involve the mass spectrum of the final hadronic states , that are different in the soft and hard wall models .",
    "the inclusion of flavour degrees of freedom in a dis process was considered in @xcite by using the d3-d7 brane model . in this article",
    "two possibilities were considered for the current interacting with the hadron .",
    "one is the current living in the ads bulk and the other a current living on the d7 brane , representing a flavour current .",
    "the structure functions obtained with the bulk current are similar to the hard and soft wall results but the case of the flavour current leads to different results .    in these studies of the dis using gauge string duality",
    "it was considered that the final hadronic state was represented by an operator with the same conformal dimension of the initial one . in ref .",
    "@xcite the case of final states with higher conformal dimensions was studied .",
    "the increase in the conformal dimension is interpreted as an increase in the number of hadronic constituents .",
    "summing over all conformal dimensions allowed , a scaling similar to geometric scaling @xcite was found .    in this article",
    "we briefly review these results for the dis in the hard wall , soft wall and d3-d7 models and also the case with final states with higher conformal dimension . for recent related studies of hadronic interactions from gauge / string duality",
