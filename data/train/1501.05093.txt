    "the suppression of @xmath0 production in relativistic heavy ion collisions is considered as an important signature to identify the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the dissociation of @xmath0 in the quark - gluon plasma due to color screening can result in a reduction of its production .",
    "the interpretation of suppression requires the detailed knowledge of the expected suppression due to the @xmath0 dissociation in the hadronic environment .",
    "the in - medium hadron properties can affect the productions of the open - charmed mesons and the @xmath0 in the relativistic heavy ion collisions , the higher charmonium states are considered as the major source of the @xmath0 @xcite . for example , the higher charmonium states can decay to the @xmath1 , @xmath2 pairs instead of decaying to the lowest state @xmath0 in case of the mass reductions of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 mesons are large enough .",
    "we have to disentangle the color screening versus the recombination of off - diagonal @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) pairs in the hot dense medium versus cold nuclear matter effects , such as nuclear absorption , shadowing and anti - shadowing , so as to draw a definite conclusion on appearance of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . the upcoming fair ( facility for antiproton and ion research )",
    "project at gsi ( institute for heavy ion research ) in darmstadt ( germany ) provides the opportunity to study the in - medium properties of the charmoniums or charmed hadrons for the first time .",
    "the cbm ( compressed baryonic matter ) collaboration intends to study the properties of the hadrons in the nuclear matter @xcite , while the @xmath9 ( anti - proton annihilation at darmstadt ) collaboration will focus on the charm spectroscopy , and mass and width modifications of the charmed hadrons in the nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however , the in - medium mass modifications are not easy to access experimentally despite the interesting physics involved , and they require more detailed theoretical studies . on the other hand ,",
    "the bottomonium states are also sensitive to the color screening , the @xmath10 suppression in high energy heavy ion collisions can also be taken as a signature to identify the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "the suppressions on the @xmath10 production in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions will be studied in details at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "extensive theoretical and experimental studies are required to explore the hadron properties in nuclear matter .",
    "the connection between the condensates and the nuclear density dependence of the in - medium hadron masses is not straightforward .",
    "the qcd sum rules provides a powerful theoretical tool in studying the in - medium hadronic properties @xcite , and has been applied extensively to study the light - flavor hadrons and charmonium states in the nuclear matter @xcite .",

    "the heavy mesons ( heavy baryons ) contain a heavy quark and a light quark ( two light quarks ) , the existence of a light quark ( two light quarks ) in the heavy mesons ( heavy baryons ) leads to large difference between the mass - shifts of the heavy mesons ( heavy baryons ) and heavy quarkonia in the nuclear matter .",
    "the former have large contributions from the light - quark condensates in the nuclear matter and the modifications of the masses originate mainly from the modifications of the quark condensates , while the latter are dominated by the gluon condensates , and the mass modifications are mild @xcite .    in previous works @xcite , the properties of the heavy mesons in the nuclear matter are studied with the qcd sum rules by taking the leading order approximation for the contributions of the quark condensates . in this article ,",
    "i take into account the next - to - leading order contributions of the quark condensates , and study the properties of the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axialvector heavy mesons in the nuclear matter with the qcd sum rules in a systematic way , and make predictions for the modifications of the masses and decay constants of the heavy mesons in the nuclear matter .",
    "measuring those effects is a long term physics goal based on further theoretical studies on the reaction dynamics and on the exploration of the experimental ability to identify more complicated processes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , i study the heavy - meson - nucleon scattering lengths as a byproduct . from the negative or positive sign of the scattering lengths ,",
    "i can obtain the conclusion qualitatively that the interactions are attractive or repulsive , which favor or disfavor the formations of the heavy - meson - nucleon bound states .",

    "width=302 ]    in the present work and refs.@xcite , the correlation functions are divided into a vacuum part and a static one - nucleon part , and the nuclear matter induced effects are extracted explicitly ; while in refs.@xcite , the pole terms of ( or ground state contributions to ) the hadronic spectral densities of the whole correlation functions are parameterized as @xmath276 , where @xmath277 and @xmath278 , and qcd sum rules for the mass center @xmath279 and the mass splitting @xmath280 are obtained . in the leading order approximation ,",
    "the present predictions of the @xmath281 and @xmath282 are compatible with that of refs.@xcite and differ greatly from that of refs.@xcite , see table 2 .",
    "the values obtained from the qcd sum rules depend heavily on the borel windows , the values extracted from different borel windows especially in different qcd sum rules maybe differ from each other greatly .    in refs.@xcite , the authors study the masses of the heavy mesons in the nuclear matter directly by including both the vacuum part and the static one - nucleon part in the qcd sum rules , then the continuum contributions are well approximated by @xmath283 , where the @xmath284 are the continuum threshold parameters , it is one of the advantages of refs.@xcite .",
    "however , they define the moments @xmath285 to study the mass - shifts , @xmath286 the odd moment @xmath287 and the even moment @xmath288 , then obtain @xmath289 and @xmath290 by assuming the @xmath291 and @xmath292 are independent on the borel parameters at the phenomenological side .",
    "in fact , @xmath293 and @xmath294 at the operator product expansion side according to the qcd spectral densities @xmath295 , which depend on the borel parameters explicitly , the approximations @xmath289 and @xmath290 lead to undetermined uncertainties .",
    "in refs.@xcite , the perturbative @xmath190 corrections to the perturbative terms are taken into account . in the qcd sum rules for the pseudoscalar @xmath3 mesons in the vacuum ,",
    "if we take into account the perturbative @xmath190 corrections to the perturbative term and vacuum condensate term , the two criteria ( pole dominance and convergence of the operator product expansion ) of the qcd sum rules leads to the borel window @xmath296 , the resulting predictions of the mass @xmath297 and decay constant @xmath298 are consistent with the experimental data . in fig.4 , i plot the contributions of the perturbative term and quark condensate term in the operator product expansion .",
    "from the figure , i can see that the main contributions come from the perturbative term , the quark condensate @xmath299 plays a less important role .",
    "the modifications of the condensates in the nuclear matter are mild , for example , @xmath300 , while the perturbative contributions are not modified ( or modified slightly by introducing a minor splitting @xmath301 , @xmath302 ) by the nuclear matter .",
    "if we turn on the in - medium effects , the contributions of the quark condensate are even smaller , the borel windows are determined dominantly by the perturbative terms @xcite .",
    "if the perturbative @xmath303 corrections to the perturbative terms are also included , the contributions of the perturbative are even larger @xcite , the qcd sum rules are dominated by the perturbative terms , which are not ( or slightly ) affected by the nuclear matter .",
    "it is not favored to extract the mass - shifts in the nuclear matter , and impairs the predictive ability .    in the present work and refs.@xcite ,",
    "the correlation functions are divided into the vacuum part and the static one - nucleon part , which are of the orders @xmath304 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "we can obtain independent qcd sum rules from the two parts respectively .",
    "the qcd sum rules correspond to the orders @xmath304 and @xmath34 respectively can have quite different borel parameters . in this article ,",
    "i separate the nuclear matter induced effects unambiguously , study the qcd sum rules correspond to the order @xmath34 , and determine the borel parameters by the criteria of the qcd sum rules .    in the conventional qcd sum rules",
    ", we usually choose the borel parameters @xmath258 to satisfy the following three criteria :    @xmath305 pole dominance at the phenomenological side ;    @xmath306 convergence of the operator product expansion ;    @xmath307 appearance of the borel platforms .    in the present work and refs.@xcite , the nuclear matter induced effects are extracted explicitly , the resulting qcd sum rules are not contaminated by the contributions of the vacuum part , the borel windows are determined completely by the nuclear matter induced effects , it is the advantage .",
    "as the qcd spectral densities are of the form @xmath82 , we have to take the hadronic spectral densities to be the form @xmath308 and model the continuum contributions with the function @xmath309 , and determine the @xmath178 by some constraints , see eq.(16 ) , where the @xmath105 denotes the ground state and excited state heavy mesons . in this article ,",
    "i attribute the higher excited states to the continuum contributions , the @xmath310-type hadronic spectral densities make sense .",
    "so the pole dominance at the phenomenological side can be released as the continuum contributions are already taken into account .",
    "furthermore , i expect that the couplings of the interpolating currents to the excited states are more weak than that to the ground states , the uncertainties originate from continuum contributions are very small .",
    "for example , the decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath311 and @xmath312 have the hierarchy @xmath313 from the dyson - schwinger equation @xcite , the lattice qcd @xcite , the qcd sum rules @xcite , etc , or from the experimental data @xcite .    in the present work and refs.@xcite ,",
    "large borel parameters are chosen to warrant the convergence of the operator product expansion and to obtain the borel platforms , and small borel parameters can not lead to platforms . in the borel windows ,",
    "where the platforms appear , the main contributions come from terms @xmath150 , the operator product expansion is well convergent . the criteria @xmath314 and @xmath315 can be satisfied .",
    "the continuum contributions are not suppressed efficiently for large borel parameters compared to that for small borel parameters . in calculations ,",
    "i observe that the predictions are insensitive to the @xmath178 , the uncertainties originate from the continuum threshold parameters @xmath178 are very small in almost all cases , the large borel parameters make sense .",
    "furthermore , the continuum contributions are already taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , from eqs.(8 - 9 ) and eqs.(12 - 13 ) , we can see that the mass - shifts @xmath316 and decay constant shifts @xmath317 reduce to zero in the limit @xmath318 , the qcd sum rules correspond to the nuclear matter induced effects decouple , their borel parameters ( irrespective of large or small ) are also irrelevant to the ones in the qcd sum rules for the vacuum part of the correlation functions .",
    "so the present predictions are sensible .",
    "the predictions depend on the in - medium hadronic spectral functions @xcite , for example , there are two generic prototypes of the in - medium spectral functions for the @xmath319 meson , they differ in details at the low mass end of the spectrum .",
    "the klingl - kaise - weise spectral function emphasizes the role of chiral in - medium @xmath320 interactions @xcite , while the rapp - wambach spectral function focuses on the role of nucleon - hole , @xmath321-hole and @xmath322-hole excitations @xcite .",
    "both of the spectral functions account quite well for the low - mass enhancements observed in dilepton spectra from high - energy nuclear collisions .",
    "however , the qcd sum rules analysis of the lowest spectral moments reveals qualitative differences with respect to their brown - rho scaling properties @xcite . if the simple spectral densities @xmath323 analogous to the ones in refs.@xcite are taken , where the @xmath324 denotes the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath325 , @xmath326",
    ", the @xmath327 denotes the vector mesons @xmath319 , @xmath328 , @xmath329 , @xmath0 , the @xmath330 denotes the constant pole residues , the in - medium mass - shifts @xmath331 are smaller than zero qualitatively @xcite .",
    "i expect that the s - wave mesons @xmath332 , @xmath333 , @xmath334 with the spin - parity @xmath335 ( or @xmath336 ) have analogous in - medium mass - shifts , at least qualitatively .",
    "further studies based on more sophisticated hadronic spectral densities are needed .",
    "in fact , there are controversies about the mass - shifts of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 mesons in the nuclear matter , some theoretical approaches indicate negative mass - shifts @xcite , while others indicate positive mass - shifts @xcite .",
    "the different predictions originate mainly from whether or not the heavy pseudoscalar and heavy vector mesons are treated on equal footing in the coupled - channel approaches .",
    "if we obtain the meson - baryon interaction kernel by treating the heavy pseudoscalar and heavy vector mesons on equal footing as required by heavy quark symmetry , the mass - shift @xmath337 is negative @xcite , which is consistent with the present work ; furthermore , the attractive d - nucleus interaction can lead to the formation of @xmath3-nucleus bound states , which can be confronted to the experimental data in the future directly @xcite .",
    "the upcoming fair project at gsi provides the opportunity to study the in - medium properties of the charmoniums or charmed hadrons for the first time , however , the high mass of charmed hadrons requires a high momentum in the antiproton beam to produce them , the conditions for observing in - medium effects seem unfavorable , as the hadrons sensitive to the in - medium effects are either at rest or have a small momentum relative to the nuclear medium .",
    "we have to find processes that would slow down the charmed hadrons inside the nuclear matter , but this requires more detailed theoretical studies .",
    "further theoretical studies on the reaction dynamics and on the exploration of the experimental ability to identify more complicated processes are still needed .",
    "in this article , i divide the two - point correlation functions of the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axialvector currents in the nuclear matter into two parts , i.e. the vacuum part and the static one - nucleon part , then study the in - medium modifications of the masses and decay constants by deriving qcd sum rules from the static one - nucleon part of the two - point correlation functions . in the operator product expansion ,",
    "i calculate the contributions of the nuclear matter induced condensates up to dimension 5 , especially i calculate the next - to - leading order contributions of the in - medium quark condensate and obtain concise expressions , which also have applications in studying the mesons properties in the vacuum . in calculation , i observe that the next - to - leading order contributions of the in - medium quark condensate are very large and should be taken into account .",
    "all in all , i study the properties of the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axialvector heavy mesons with the qcd sum rules in a systematic way , and obtain the shifts of the masses and decay constants in the nuclear matter .",
    "the numerical results indicate that the mass - shifts of the negative parity and positive parity heavy mesons are negative and positive , respectively . for the pseudoscalar meson @xmath3",
    ", i obtain the prediction @xmath338 , which is in contrast to the prediction in refs.@xcite , where the mass - shift is positive @xmath339 . in refs.@xcite ,",
    "the authors study the masses of the heavy mesons in the nuclear matter directly by including both the vacuum part and static one - nucleon part with the qcd sum rules , and parameterize the spectral density of the whole correlation functions by a simple function @xmath276 .",
    "i discuss the differences between the qcd sum rules in the present work and that in refs.@xcite in details , and show why i prefer the present predictions . in the present work and refs.@xcite ,",
    "the finite widths of the mesons in the nuclear matter are neglected , further studies based on the more sophisticated hadronic spectral densities by including the finite widths are needed .",
    "as the masses of the heavy meson paries , such as the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath340 , @xmath341 are modified in the nuclear environment , we should take into account those effects carefully in studying the production of the @xmath0 ( and @xmath10 ) so as to identifying the quark - gluon plasmas .",
    "furthermore , i study the heavy - meson - nucleon scattering lengths as a byproduct , and obtain the conclusion qualitatively about the possible existence of the heavy - meson - nucleon bound states .",
