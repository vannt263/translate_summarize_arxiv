    "<S> heavier baryon resonances prove to be crucial for reaction dynamics and particle production at ags .    </S>",
    "<S> many open questions in current nuclear and particle physics require high energy and particle densities of nuclear matter to be resolved . the only way to obtain these extreme conditions in the laboratory is the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it has been shown that the production of very high densities requires massive systems and high energy as provided by the gold beam at ags in brookhaven @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several in - medium effects are eventually present at high baryon densities , such as resonance matter @xcite , mean fields due to changing quark and gluon condensates @xcite , the decrease of baryon masses due to chiral symmetry restoration @xcite and the quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the formation of resonance matter contributes essentially to enhanced strangeness @xcite and subthreshold anti - proton production @xcite , baryon stopping and hadronic flow effects .    </S>",
    "<S> microscopic and thermal calculations have shown that pion production proceeds practically exclusively via the excitation of @xmath1 resonances in @xmath4 reactions around 1 gev/@xmath5 @xcite . however , since the pion yield is much smaller than the number of participating nucleons , the whole dynamics is dominated by nucleon interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> first efforts to investigate the @xmath0 production in si+pb collisions the ultrarelativistic regime directly via @xmath6 correlations have recently been performed by the e814 collaboration @xcite . in general </S>",
    "<S> , pions might be useful to learn about the @xmath1 resonance @xcite due to the almost sole decay mode @xmath7 and the particular phase space distribution of @xmath8 from @xmath1-decays .    at higher energies ( @xmath9gev ) , a two - component structure in the transverse momentum spectra of pions produced in @xmath4 collisions has been observed @xcite which is not seen in elementary pp - reactions .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath1 matter  was coined to describe a system in which the @xmath1 degree of freedom is as much excited as nucleons . the second component in 10 - 15 gev/@xmath5 collisions which is much stiffer than the soft one has to be produced by another mechanism , possibly excitation of higher mass baryonic resonances as will be elucidated in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> calculations with various transport models ( qgsm , rqmd , hydrodynamics ) show a rich event shape differing markedly from the pure fireball scenario . </S>",
    "<S> collective flow seems to be strongly reflected in the baryonic distributions ( protons , deuterons ) . in order to take into account resonances as well as flow effects and the complex event geometry , we use in this paper the rqmd approach @xcite to predict the formation of dense resonance matter in violent heavy ion reactions . </S>",
    "<S> the ingredients of the model allow to extract explicitely the role of resonance decays for the shape of the final @xmath8-spectra .    </S>",
    "<S> the rqmd model is a microscopic phasespace approach in which the basic excitation mechanism is two - body particle scattering . </S>",
    "<S> both collision partners may get excited or they may annihilate into a single @xmath10-channel state ( e.  g. in meson - baroyn interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> several medium effects have been explored in the rqmd approach , e.  g. mean fields @xcite and string fusion into color ropes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1-resonance is of special importance for the topics discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that @xmath1 production ( e.  g. in @xmath11 ) , absorption ( e.  g. @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , formation ( @xmath14 ) and the decay ( @xmath15 ) are treated dynamically . </S>",
    "<S> we use non - fixed @xmath1-masses , improved detailed balance relations for time - reversed cross sections and the short lived nature of the @xmath1-resonance . </S>",
    "<S> low mass excitations ( e.  g. nonstrange baryons with mass @xmath16 ) are projected on discrete resonance states , higher mass excitations decay stringlike @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model describes well nuclear stopping and particle production from 1 to 200 gev/@xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the source size extracted from rqmd events with the hbt technique agrees well with recent measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.[fig2 ] shows the transverse mass spectrum of freeze - out @xmath17 in au(10.7 gev/@xmath5)au with central impact parameter ( @xmath18 fm ) and potential interaction included . </S>",

    "<S> the integrated spectrum shows a bending that is suggestive of two different contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations give that at low transverse momenta most of the pions stem from @xmath1 decays . </S>",
    "<S> pions from heavy resonances contribute essentially at high @xmath19 and dominate the spectrum for @xmath20 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour is quite easy to understand because the decay of highly excited resonances into pions will produce decay products with more kinetic energy than the decay of a @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 mesons contribute almost 10% of the total yield , higher resonances only to 5% . </S>",
    "<S> the decays of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 into pions and the pion elastic scattering add up to another 15% of the total yield that will be neglected in our consideration .    the upper part of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ siginv ] shows the @xmath1-source producing most of the final pions revealing a strong peak at midrapidity . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally the dominance of @xmath1-resonance decays for low-@xmath19 pions may be verified from the single spectra using a technique proposed by one of us @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we turn to rapidities far from midrapidity the slopes of the distribution will change drastically with @xmath26 . if the transverse momentum of a pion produced by @xmath1-decay vanishes ( @xmath27 ) , we will obtain a longitudinal momentum @xmath28 in the @xmath1 rest frame , ( assuming a fixed @xmath1 mass @xmath29 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a rapidity of 1.27 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the pion is fed into a completely different rapidity region . at rapidities with highest densities of @xmath1 resonances </S>",

    "<S> the distribution shows a minimum at @xmath35 : the same rapidity where the stopped @xmath1 source is located . within a surprisingly small relative momentum bin ( @xmath36 ) </S>",
    "<S> we find 189 @xmath1 s ( 48% of all baryons ) so that it is reasonable to speak about a @xmath1-matter state at @xmath35 .    since we obtain that huge amount of resonances at 10 gev/@xmath5 contributing to the final spectra , we are now interested in the dynamics of the resonances during the reaction . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] shows the time evolution of the number of resonances in central au+au reactions ( @xmath37 fm ) at 1 gev/@xmath5 ( left ) and 10.7 gev/@xmath5 ( right ) . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath1 contributes nearly 50% to all resonances . with increasing time , </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath1 survives : its apparent lifetime ( @xmath39 ) is much longer than that of the other excited states due to consecutive @xmath40 processes that are the dominant reactions in the final stage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this becomes visible by switching off the @xmath1 formation channel @xmath14 which yields a decrease of the @xmath1-lifetime to @xmath41 .    in order to predict a resonance _ </S>",

    "<S> state we have to check whether the density of resonances and @xmath1 s is comparable to nuclear ground state density . </S>",

    "<S> [ dichte ] the time evolution of densities and occupied volume of baryons ( solid line ) and @xmath1 s ( dashed ) is plotted . </S>",
    "<S> the reaction zone is divided into small boxes of @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> the density is calculated by averaging over the 10% boxes with the highest density . to obtain the volume all boxes with densities larger than @xmath43 </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath1 volume becomes @xmath45 being in the same order of magnitude as the reaction volume . </S>",
    "<S> the average baryon and @xmath1-densities in this volume are 3@xmath44 and @xmath44 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> up to 10 fm/@xmath38 the @xmath1 density is still @xmath46 while the volume becomes @xmath47 .    in order to extrapolate our results to other energy regions we plot in fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] ( left ) . </S>",
    "<S> only 1015% of all baryons are excited to resonances , most of them @xmath0 , so that a description without higher resonances might be possible . but due to the smaller number of resonances nucleonic degrees of freedom are most prominent . </S>",
    "<S> it would be an euphemism to call such a state resonance matter @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the energy the more heavy resonances as @xmath53 or @xmath54 are produced , but even at cern energies ( 200 gev/@xmath5 ) half of all resonances are @xmath0 . thus the @xmath1 remains the most important resonance state over a wide energy range , but for energies higher than 2 gev it is necessary to take the dynamics of higher mass resonances into account . </S>"
