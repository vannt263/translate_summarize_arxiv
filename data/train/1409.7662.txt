    "the motivation of our work comes from the renormalization of qft in curved space times , indeed the question adressed in this paper can not be avoided in this context and also the technical results of this paper form the core of the proof that perturbative quantum field theories are renormalizable on curved space times @xcite .    since l.  schwartz , we know that the tensor product of distributions is continuous  @xcite and the product of a distribution by a smooth function is hypocontinuous  @xcite ( see definition [ hypodef ] ) , although it is not jointly continuous  @xcite .",
    "however , in many applications ( for instance the multiplication of distributions involved in quantum field theory ) , we can not work with all distributions and we must consider the subsets @xmath0 of distributions whose wave front set is included in some closed subset @xmath1 of @xmath2 . in the following , @xmath1 will always denote a * cone * i.e. @xmath3 for every @xmath4 .",
    "indeed the spaces @xmath0 are widely used in microlocal analysis because wave front set conditions rule the fundamental operations on distributions ( multiplication , pull - back , push - forward and restriction ) which are known to be sequentially continuous  @xcite .",
    "hrmander himself , who introduced the concept of a wave front set  @xcite , equipped @xmath0 with a _ pseudo - topology _",
    "@xcite , which is just a rule describing the convergence of sequences and not a topology .",
    "in particular , when hrmander writes that the pullback is continuous  @xcite , he means `` sequentially continuous '' , precisely because he does not define any topology on @xmath0 ( in @xcite hrmander states explicitly that the fundamental operations are sequentially continuous ) .",
    "duistermaat s famous lecture notes  @xcite are more ambiguous because they define a locally convex topology on @xmath0 and they state that the pull - back  @xcite , the push - forward  @xcite and the product of distributions  @xcite are continuous maps . a similar confusion exists in the modern literature , where heifetz states that the pull - back by a smooth map is continuous  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to clarify the situation , to determine the precise regularity of the operations with distributions and to define a new topology for which the fundamental operations have optimal continuity properties .",
    "our paper is divided in two parts .    in the first part",
    ", we review hrmander s pseudo - topology and we show that the right framework to understand it is the natural bornology of @xmath5 @xcite . indeed",
    "this concept , introduced by bourbaki  @xcite , is enough to control the sequential continuity in @xmath5 .",
    "however , sequential continuity and bornology are not well adapted to applications in renormalization of qft on curved space times and valuation theory @xcite .",
    "for such applications , it is desirable to have available a topology on @xmath5 for which the usual operations of pull  back and push  forward are continuous and the tensor product is hypocontinuous . and most importantly , we need to study situations where the maps depend smoothly on extra parameters so that pull  back and push ",
    "forward should be _ uniformly continuous _ w.r.t .",
    "the extra parameters .",
    "duistermaat , in his lecture notes @xcite , proposed a locally convex topology on @xmath5 .",
    "however , we shall present in subsection [ aleskercounterex ] a counterexample due to s. alesker showing that the tensor product is not separately continuous and the pull  back is not continuous for this topology .",
    "this prompts us to introduce in the second part another , finer topology on @xmath5 .",
    "this topology , called the _",
    "normal _ topology of @xmath5 by dabrowski and brouder @xcite , is defined in section [ normaltopsect ] . in this new topology",
    ", we prove in theorem [ hypotens ] that the tensor product is hypocontinuous . in sections",
    "[ pullbacksect ] and [ prodpushsect ] , we use the functional properties of @xmath0 @xcite , to give conceptually transparent proofs , without hard analytic estimates and using only the geometry of wave front sets , that :    * the pull - back by a smooth map is continuous ( proposition [ pullbackprop ] ) * the pull  back by a family of smooth maps depending smoothly on parameters is uniformly continuous ( theorem [ pbenfamille ] ) * the push - forward by a smooth map is also continuous ( theorem [ pushforwardthm ] ) * the push ",
    "forward by a family of smooth maps ( theorem [ pshfwdenfamille ] ) depending smoothly on parameters is uniformly continuous * the multiplication of distributions ( theorem [ hypocontprod ] ) and the convolution product ( theorem [ convolprod ] ) are hypocontinuous",
    ".    finally in section [ gaborsect ] , we discuss how the wave front set of distributions on manifolds can be defined in an intrinsic way .    in appendices ,",
    "we prove important technical results concerning the covering of the complement of @xmath1 , the topology of @xmath6 and the fact that the additional seminorms used to define the topology of @xmath0 can be taken to be countable",
    ". +    first part",
    "in his fundamental paper  @xcite , hrmander defines , for every open subset @xmath7 of @xmath8 and every closed cone @xmath9 , the space @xmath10 .",
    "he endowes @xmath0 with a _ pseudo - topology _ , a concept due to choquet  @xcite where conditions of convergence of sequences are given but no topology is defined ( for example by a family of neighborhoods or of open sets ) .",
    "more precisely  @xcite ,    [ convdef ] let @xmath7 be some open set in @xmath11 .",
    "we say that a sequence @xmath12 converges to @xmath13 in @xmath0 in the sense of hrmander iff    * @xmath14 converges to @xmath13 for the weak topology of @xmath15 , * for every @xmath16 , every @xmath17 and every closed cone @xmath18 in @xmath8 such that @xmath19 , @xmath20    a map @xmath21 is said to be _ sequentially continuous _ iff the image of a sequence @xmath14 that converges to @xmath13 is a sequence @xmath22 that converges to @xmath23 .",
    "it was noticed by hogbe - nlend  @xcite that a pseudo - topology can often be interpreted in terms of a bornology . in this section",
    ", we prove that this is the case for @xmath0 and that a map is sequentially continuous iff it is bounded .",
    "we give some basic definitions of bornological concepts .",
    "a bornology on @xmath24 is a family of bounded subsets of @xmath24 .",

    "these axioms are very natural properties of bounded sets : a point is bounded , a subset of a bounded set is bounded and the union of two bounded sets is bounded .    among topological vector spaces , it is well known that the locally convex ones have nice properties .",
    "a similar concept holds for bornologies but we need first to define a disked hull :    a subset @xmath30 of a vector space @xmath32 over @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) is a _ disk _",

    "the _ disked hull _ of a subset @xmath30 of a vector space @xmath32 is the smallest disk of @xmath32 containing @xmath30 .",
    "now , a class of bornological vector space which has good properties is the class of convex bornological spaces",
    ".    let @xmath32 be a vector space over @xmath33 .",
    "a bornology @xmath25 on @xmath32 is said to be a _",
    "convex bornology _ if , for every @xmath29 and @xmath30 in @xmath25 and every @xmath38 , the sets @xmath41 , @xmath42 and the disked hull of @xmath29 belong to @xmath25 . then @xmath32 or @xmath43 is called a convex bornological space .",
    "let @xmath32 be a topological vector space , then by definition the bounded sets are the subsets @xmath30 of @xmath32 such that for any neighborhood @xmath18 of @xmath44 , there exists @xmath45 such that for all @xmath46 with @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath32 is a _ locally convex _ space whose topology is defined by a family of seminorms @xmath49 , the bounded sets of @xmath32 are the sets that are bounded for every seminorm @xmath50 and they form a natural bornology , called the _ von neumann _ bornology of @xmath32 .",

    "* thm 33 ) that all families of seminorms on @xmath0 which define topologies which are finer than the weak topology and coarser than the mackey topology ( see @xcite for the definition of the mackey topology ) give the same von neumann bornology ( i.e. define the same bounded sets ) .",
    "hence this canonical von neumann bornology will be called the bornology of @xmath0 .",
    "the interesting maps between two topological spaces are the continuous maps .",
    "the analogous objects for bornological spaces are the bounded maps :    a map @xmath51 between two bornological spaces is said to be _ bounded _ if the image of every bounded set of @xmath32 is a bounded set of @xmath52 .",
    "we will show that sequential continuity and boundedness are equivalent for @xmath5 .",
    "the concept of convergence relevant for bornological spaces was proposed in 1938 by fichtenholz  @xcite and was elaborated by mackey in his phd thesis .",
    "this definition can be motivated as follows . in a normed space",

    "a sequence @xmath53 in @xmath32 is said to _ converge bornologically _ ( or to _ mackey - converge _ ) to zero if there exists a bounded disk @xmath67 and a sequence @xmath60 of positive real numbers tending to zero , such that @xmath61 for every integer @xmath57 .    to ensure that the limit of a convergent sequence is unique we say that a convex bornological space is _ separated _ if the only vector space of @xmath25 is @xmath68 .",

    "described in section [ exhaustionsubsec ] , we see that lemma [ approxlemma1 ] gives us a family of indices @xmath1010 , functions @xmath1011 and cones @xmath995 adapted to @xmath1009 such that the conditions of the grigis - sjstrand lemma are satisfied .",
