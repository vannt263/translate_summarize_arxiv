    "there is great interest in the development of new methods for the treatment of nonlinear problems .",
    "for example , amore and senz  @xcite have recently considered the problem of calculating the period of a classical oscillator with high precision .",
    "the method that they propose proves to be quite effective and applicable with limited effort to a large spectrum of problems .",
    "in fact , some of the problems that considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are textbook examples , for which such method provides very accurate solutions ; remarkably such solutions do not involve complicated transcendental functions but are expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "amore and collaborators have recently discussed mainly two strategies for solving nonlinear problems .",
    "one of them is the direct treatment of the integral that gives the period of oscillation or any other relevant property of the system , and the other is based on an improved lindstedt ",
    "poincar technique @xcite . in both cases the authors resort to a sort of variational perturbation theory like that often used in quantum mechanics and other fields of theoretical physics to treat divergent series @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is twofold : in first place we want to generalize the method of @xcite and to express it in a more systematic fashion ; in second place we want to extend the previous analysis to consider large orders and discuss the convergence of the expansions that we obtain .",
    "we investigate the systematic calculation of integrals with applications in various fields of theoretical physics , such as , for example , the period of nonlinear oscillations , the deflection of the light by the sun , and the precession of the perihelion of a planet orbiting around the sun .",
    "we try to provide simple though sufficiently accurate analytical formulas , and test the convergence of the series , which give such formulas at low order . in doing so",
    ", we compare our results with those in recent literature .",
    "many physical problems reduce to the calculation of integrals of the kind : @xmath0 where @xmath1 has simple zeros at @xmath2 and @xmath3 and is nonnegative in the interval @xmath4 .",
    "such integrals appear in many branches of classical mechanics as we will shortly show . in order to derive a simple analytical expression for the integral @xmath5 we add and subtract a function @xmath6 , which satisfies the same boundary conditions , and write @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the method that we propose consists of expanding the integrand in powers of @xmath9 which leads to a series of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 $ ] is a combinatorial number .",
    "present method proves to be practical when we can obtain simple analytical solutions for a sufficiently large number of integrals in ( [ eq : i_n ] ) .",
    "according to what was said above about the function @xmath1 we can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 in @xmath4 .",
    "a simple suitable reference function @xmath6 for many physical problems is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an adjustable parameter , so that @xmath17    in order to simplify the equations still further , we introduce the change of variable @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "we can thus rewrite the integral ( [ eq : i_delta ] ) as @xmath20 and the terms in the expansion ( [ eq : i_n ] ) become @xmath21    clearly , the integral @xmath5 is independent of @xmath16 , but the partial sums @xmath22 will depend on that arbitrary parameter .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to require the partial sums to be independent of @xmath16 , which leads to the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms)@xcite that states that the optimal value of @xmath16 should satisfy @xmath23 if we take into account the properties of the combinatorial numbers and that @xmath24 , we can easily prove that @xmath25 according to this equation , the pms condition is equivalent to @xmath26 which only takes place for odd values of @xmath27 in the real field . for even values of @xmath27",
    "we may instead resort to the alternative pms condition @xmath28 but it is not necessary as we will see later on .",
    "the periods of many anharmonic oscillators have been widely studied and therefore they are suitable benchmarks for new approaches . here",
    "we consider a particle of unit mass moving in a one dimensional anharmonic potential @xmath29 and calculate the period according to the well known expression @xmath30      a widely studied example is the duffing oscillator , which corresponds to the potential @xmath31 . in this case",
    "we choose @xmath32 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the amplitude of the oscillations , and @xmath34 .",
    "notice that @xmath35 and that @xmath36 takes a simple form : @xmath37 = \\frac{1}{\\omega ^{2}}\\ \\left [ \\frac{\\mu a^{2}}{4}\\ ( 1+\\cos ^{2}\\theta ) -\\omega ^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\right ] \\ ,",
    "\\label{eq : delta_duffing}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 as follows from equation ( [ eq : x(theta ) ] ) with @xmath39 .",
    "notice that the period depends only on @xmath40 .    the value of @xmath16 according to the pms to first order @xmath41 yields @xmath42 eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_pms ] ) shows that @xmath43 for all values of @xmath44 , and @xmath45 so that the series ( [ eq : i_series ] ) converges for all values of @xmath45 .",
    "a most interesting feature of the pms for this model is that @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , and for the same value of @xmath48 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega_pms_duffing ] ) .",
    "the calculation of the even terms is straightforward and yields the compact expression @xmath49    if we choose @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_duffing ] ) then eq .  (",
    "[ eq : i_theta ] ) gives us a well  known exact expression for the period@xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "we thus obtain the alternative series expansion : @xmath53    if @xmath54 , then the potential of the oscillator exhibits two barriers and the amplitude of the motion can not be larger than @xmath55 . consequently , the exact expression for the period is valid for @xmath56 .",
    "present series ( [ eq : t_series_duffing_present ] ) converges uniformly for @xmath57 whereas the series in eq .",
    "( [ eq : t_series_nayfeh ] ) does not converge for @xmath58 .",
    "the exact solution @xmath59 for the duffing oscillator satisfies the virial theorem @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for the classical expectation value of @xmath62 .",
    "it is most interesting to note that the value of @xmath16 in @xmath63 that makes @xmath64 to satisfy the virial theorem for the duffing oscillator is @xmath65 .    in a recent paper pelster et al .",
    "@xcite ( pks ) calculated the leading term of the strong  coupling expansion for the frequency of the duffing oscillator by means of a series produced by the lindstedt ",

    "our series has by far the best rate of convergence .",
    "in fact , altough all three series exhibit exponential convergence @xmath71 the slope @xmath72 of our linear fit is much greater : @xmath73 , compared to @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "moreover , our expression ( [ eq : b0_present ] ) , which is much simpler than the one of pelster et al @xcite , enables us to calculate the slope @xmath75 exactly .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] we compare the logarithmic relative error for the frequency calculated to second order with the three methods as a function of @xmath45 .",

    "[ fig_1 ] , corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that both the present expansion and the result of amore et al @xcite yield an error which is always smaller than the asymptotic one ; on the other hand , the results of pelster et al @xcite do not follow this rule and yield a particularly large error in the region of @xmath78 .",
    "we clearly appreciate that our proposal is much more convenient than kleinert s square  root trick @xcite .",
    "we also consider the potential @xmath79 because it has recently been treated by means of the combination of the methods of linearization and harmonic balance by wu and li @xcite ( wl ) .",

    "( [ fig_3 ] ) we plot the logarithmic relative error of the period for @xmath92 as a function of the order of approximation .",
    "once again we see that our expansion converges exponentially .",
    "indeed , the error decreases as @xmath93 , where it is not hard to see that @xmath94 .      the anharmonic oscillators with even potentials of the form @xmath95 exhibit many features in common . for example , the period @xmath96 depends on the parameter @xmath97 and satisfies a small@xmath45 expansion @xmath98 and a large@xmath45 expansion @xmath99 the optimal value of @xmath16 given by our method is of the form @xmath100 the optimal value of @xmath101 is the same to all orders for @xmath102 as we have already discussed above .",
    "it changes slowly with @xmath27 for the sextic oscillator and more rapidly for greater values of @xmath103 . in order to make the discussion simpler we just consider the convergence of the series for the most difficult case given by @xmath104 for @xmath105 the value of @xmath101 given by the pms of first order does not give us a convergent series for this quantity .",
    "the reason is that the maximum value of @xmath106 is greater than 1 under such condition .",
    "values of @xmath101 given by the pms of higher order correct this problem .",
    "numerical calculation suggests that the values of @xmath101 given by the pms at increasingly greater order approaches the value of @xmath101 for which the maximum of @xmath107 equals minus one times its minimum .",
    "such value of @xmath108 makes @xmath109 for all values of @xmath110 and we thus have a remarkably simple criterion for obtaining a convergent series . for concreteness",
    "we call @xmath111 this value of @xmath101 because it balances the positive and negative values of @xmath107 in such a way that @xmath112 vs. @xmath101 obtained by partial sums of order @xmath113 show that the pms always give the best approach to the exact value at each order .",
    "plots of @xmath114 vs. @xmath27 suggest that our partial sums with @xmath111 converge exponentially for all anharmonic oscillators ( [ eq : vx2x2k ] ) .    for negative values of @xmath115",
    "there is periodic motion provided that @xmath116 .",
    "plots of @xmath117 vs @xmath27 for anharmonic oscillators with @xmath118 show two almost straight lines , one for even @xmath27 lying always lower than the one for odd @xmath27 .",
    "in other words , the partial sums with even @xmath27 and odd @xmath27 converge exponentially to the actual value of @xmath119 .",
    "the treatment of noneven potentials is slightly different .",
    "we illustrate the procedure by means of the simplest such oscillator : @xmath120    the factorization of @xmath121 leads to @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124    a straightforward calculation based on the change of variable ( [ eq : x(theta ) ] ) shows that the pms at first order yields @xmath125 and @xmath126    it is clear that all the perturbation corrections of odd order vanish and we obtain the same series as in the case of the duffing oscillator : @xmath127    the potential  energy function exhibits a maximum @xmath128 at @xmath129 ;  therefore , there will be periodic motion for all values of energy satisfying @xmath130    in this case we obtain the exact solution by means of the integral @xmath131 that yields the series ( [ eq : tx2x3_series ] ) on expansion in a taylor series about @xmath132 .",

    "we thus obtain the series",

    "[ fig_5 ] we plot the logarithm of the relative error over the angular precession .",
    "we notice that our approximation is able to reproduce the exact result very accurately , even for very small @xmath145 .",
    "however , our series does not reproduce the singular point of the exact integral exactly , because this singularity is due to the appearance of the third root of the cubic polynomial inside the integration interval .",
    "in other words , the factor function @xmath146 is negative for some values of @xmath44 when @xmath144 is smaller than the critical value @xmath147 . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "the partial sums of our series approach the exact value of the integral as we add more terms .",
    "we can improve our results by splitting the integral into two parts , exactly at the new zero of @xmath148 , treating each integral in the way indicated .",
    "however , we do not deem it necessary to discuss such calculation here because it does not add anything new to what was already done .",

    "the method just outlined also applies to non polynomial potentials . as a representative example we consider the simple pendulum , and without loss of generality we choose unit mass and length .",
    "we obtain particularly simple expressions if we expand the potential @xmath157 in a taylor series .",

    "the leading term of the series ( [ eq : t_series_duffing_present ] ) yields in this case @xmath163 taking into account terms of higher order of the series ( [ eq : t_series_duffing_present ] ) does not improve results because the mayor source of error is the expansion of the potential only through fourth order .",

    "we show that the resulting series are suitable for all values of the relevant physical parameters , from unstable equilibrium through the strong  coupling , and for all the anharmonic oscillators considered here .",
    "we easily derive simple low  order analytical expressions that are more accurate than those in the literature , and we have shown that the rate of convergence of our series is greater than those proposed by other authors . in some cases",
