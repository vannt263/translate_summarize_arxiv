    "in quantum information theory it is generally accepted that ( i ) total correlations of a bipartite quantum state are quantified by quantum mutual information ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath0 ( ii ) the total correlations @xmath1 can be decomposed into classical and quantum correlations ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath2 ( iii ) the quantum correlations are dominated by the classical correlations ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath3 notice that the quantum correlations are not only limited to quantum entanglement , because separable quantum states can also have correlations which are responsible for the improvements of some quantum tasks that can not be simulated by classical methods @xcite .    however , there are some results that may raise doubts as to whether the statements ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold for all @xmath4 . in the following we",
    "briefly review and discuss a few of them .",
    "for example , it has been shown that there are quantum states for which statements ( i ) and ( ii ) can not be simultaneously true , if quantum correlations are measured by relative entropy of entanglement while classical correlations are quantified by a measure based on the maximum information that could be extracted on one system by making a povm measurement on the other one @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that for certain quantum states the quantum correlations , as measured by entanglement of formation , exceed half of the total correlations , as measured by quantum mutual information , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "if one assumes that statements ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold for all @xmath4 , then one concludes that entanglement of formation can not be considered as a measure of quantum correlations .",
    "however , if one assumes that entanglement of formation is a measure of quantum correlations and statements ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold , then it can be shown that for these quantum states @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that for certain quantum states quantum correlations , as measured by entanglement of formation , exceed total correlations , as measured by quantum mutual information , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it means that entanglement of formation can not be considered as a measure of quantum correlations , if one assumes that statements ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold for all @xmath4 .",
    "however , if one assumes that entanglement of formation is a measure of quantum correlations and statements ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold , then again one comes to conclusion that for these quantum states @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that for some quantum states quantum correlations , as measured by entanglement of formation , exceed @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath5 @xcite . if one assumes that statements ( i ) and ( ii ) hold for all @xmath4 , then one concludes that for these states @xmath9 .",
    "however , if one assumes that entanglement of formation is a measure of quantum correlations and statements ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold , then once again one comes to conclusion that for these quantum states @xmath6 .",
    "the above examples show that statement ( i ) may not be true for all bipartite quantum states .",
    "it is clear that if we assume that it is true , then we immediately conclude that quantum mutual information must be a measure of total correlations also in the case when the quantum state has only classical correlations , i.e. @xmath10    in the present paper , we show that this is not the case for some classically correlated quantum mixed states and therefore in general case quantum mutual information can not be considered as a measure of total correlations of bipartite quantum states .",
    "assume that alice and bob share a pair of qubits in the following state @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "this state can not have quantum correlations because it is separable and qubit @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is in the state @xmath15 which is a mixture of orthogonal states @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the correlations between two orthogonal states of qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be purely classical ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "if the measurement outcome of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , then qubit @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is certainly in the state @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the classical correlations between two orthogonal states of qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 are simply correlations between two classical random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponding to the measurement outcomes of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",

    "assume now , according to the statement ( i ) , that total correlations of a bipartite quantum state are quantified by quantum mutual information which is defined in formal analogy to classical mutual information as @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the von neumann entropy .",

    "( [ eq : cm ] ) the classical correlations between qubits @xmath13 and @xmath14 are measured by the quantum mutual information . in the case under consideration",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath38 is just classical mutual information of random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 given by @xmath39 therefore , we see that the classical correlations content of the quantum state ( [ stan qubitow ] ) can be arbitrarily small , as measured by classical mutual information , because @xmath40 .",
    "now , we check if these correlations can be really arbitrarily small . from eq .",
    "( [ prawdopodobienstwa warunkowe dla qubitow ] ) it follows that if alice s measurement outcome is @xmath22 , then bob s one is @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath14 is a one - to - one function of @xmath13 , @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it means that the random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 and what follows the states of qubits are perfectly correlated in the information - theoretic sense . therefore",
    ", we see that in the general case quantum mutual information can not be considered as a measure of total correlations in bipartite quantum states .    now , we show why the classical mutual information @xmath42 does not capture all the correlations between random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 , except the case when @xmath43 .",
    "we know that shannon entropy of random variable @xmath14 , @xmath44 , is a measure of alice s _ a priori _ uncertainty about the measurement outcome of @xmath21 and if the measurement outcome of @xmath20 is @xmath22 , then alice s uncertainty about the measurement outcome of @xmath45 is changed , preferably reduced , to @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , the information she gained about the measurement outcome of @xmath45 due to the measurement of @xmath20 is given by @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the average information gain about the measurement outcome of @xmath21 due to the knowledge of the measurement outcome of @xmath20 is @xmath48 , and it can be shown that it is equal to @xmath42 . therefore , we see that the average information gain about one random variable due to the knowledge of other one can be arbitrarily small although they are perfectly correlated . thus it is clear that classical mutual information is not a measure of correlations between two random variables , it is rather a measure of their mutual dependency .",
    "this conclusion leads us to the following question : what is an information - theoretic measure of correlations between random variables @xmath13 and @xmath14 ? for a pair of random variables with identical probability mass functions cover and thomas @xcite define it in the following way @xmath49 in the case under consideration , @xmath50 and it can be shown that @xmath51 , therefore @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath13 and @xmath14 are perfectly correlated for all @xmath12 .",
    "in the next section we show how to extend this definition to the case when the probability mass functions are not identical .",
