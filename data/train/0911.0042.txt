    "in essence , there are three different possible implementations for quantum walks ( qw ) , all taking place in discrete spaces ( graphs ) .",
    "two are quantum analogues of markov chains @xcite : generalizations of diffusion - like dynamics , where time is continuous ( ctqw ) @xcite , and discrete time unitary maps @xcite , known as coin qw ( cqw ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown to exist a direct relation between these two cases @xcite .",
    "the third ( sqw ) , also a discrete time formulation , is physically appealing since it is based on the idea of scattering in multi - port interferometers @xcite .    due to the importance of markov chains in random algorithms , cqw and ctqw",
    "are extensively used in their quantum versions @xcite , often being more efficient because the exponentially faster hitting times of qw @xcite .",
    "relevant is also the finding that one can implement universal quantum computation through scattering processes in a ctqw model @xcite .",
    "regarding applications for sqw , they seem to be particularly suitable @xcite to solve searching problems @xcite .    it is generally believed that cqw , ctqw and sqw have distinct advantages in different contexts @xcite .",
    "for instance , universal port gates in quantum computation like hadamard s @xcite are easier to implemented with cqw , the most common formulation in the mathematical and computer science literature . on the other hand ,",
    "the construction of sqw in graphs of arbitrary topologies is more direct , and thus conceivably simpler to realize experimentally .",
    "furthermore , since it is based on an scattering approach , analytical techniques are far more developed for sqw than for coin models @xcite .",
    "hence ; ( i ) to formulate in a constructive way both the cqw and sqw for graphs of any topology @xcite and for position dependent quantum amplitudes @xcite ; ( ii ) to prove their unitary equivalence in the general case ( previously established only for particular situations @xcite ) ; and finally ( iii ) to show how to obtain the probabilities for one model from the other ; are fundamental because the following .",
    "first , a constructive rather than an abstract formulation makes easier concrete implementations of such systems , even for arbitrary topologies ( e.g. , by means of be condensates in optical lattices @xcite ) .",
    "second , such results would bridge the gap between two apparent distinct quantization schemes for a same class of systems .",
    "finally , they also would show that the usages for one model are equally possible for the other .",
    "the points ( i)-(iii ) are then the goals of the present paper .",
    "we assume an undirected simple arbitrary graph @xcite , whose nodes are labeled in @xmath0 .",
    "its topology is entirely determined by the sets @xmath1 , which represent the @xmath2 nodes connected to the node @xmath3 .",
    "thus , if @xmath4 belongs to @xmath5 , then there exists exactly one edge between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "also , to any node @xmath3 we associate the set of integers @xmath6 .",
    "each element @xmath7 of @xmath8 corresponds to a different edge attached to @xmath3 , in a one - to - one relation . note that if @xmath9 and @xmath10 have a common edge , then there are two integers numbers , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , associated to such edge , one due to @xmath9 and other to @xmath10 .    a given mapping ( function ) on a graph is said locally - adaptable if : ( i ) it can be constructed for any graph node @xmath3 ; ( ii ) for each @xmath3 , it depends only on the edge structure of the nodes in @xmath5 ; and ( iii ) it is always well - defined regardless the number of elements in @xmath13",
    "this is an important concept because if one can establish time evolution relaying only on locally - adaptable mappings , then the resulting dynamics is valid for any graph topology .",
    "so , consider two locally - adaptable functions that direct reflect the specific structure of a given graph .",
    "the first , @xmath14 , associates each @xmath7 from @xmath8 to a single @xmath4 from @xmath5 , such that @xmath15 gives the node connected to @xmath3 through the edge labeled @xmath7 with respect to @xmath3 . for the particular example",
    "schematically depicted in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , we have @xmath16 and @xmath17 , thus @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , where each @xmath22 assumes one of the values in @xmath8 . the second , @xmath23 , maps",
    "each @xmath22 from @xmath8 to the single element @xmath7 of @xmath24 representing the edge joining @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "again in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) we have @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 belongs to @xmath31 , @xmath32 to @xmath33 , and so forth .",
    "note that in general @xmath34 .",
    "the above mappings are strictly related to the graph specific topology . however , more general locally - adaptable functions can also be defined .",
    "the next three will be very useful .",
    "@xmath35 extends @xmath36 since it associates each @xmath7 from @xmath8 to an unique arbitrary element of @xmath37 , e.g. , in the particular case of fig . 1 ( b ) , we have @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is in @xmath31 .",
    "although such function is locally - adaptable , for an appropriate and consistent latter construction of the quantum evolution along the whole graph , we consider an extra restriction for @xmath40 . from its very definition , for any @xmath41",
    "we have that @xmath42 is also an element of @xmath43 .",
    "then , we impose additionally that @xmath44 if @xmath45 ( @xmath46 in @xmath43 ) , i.e. , the set @xmath47",
    ". observe that this restriction can always be fullfiled whatever the graph topology .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "1 ( b ) we have @xmath48 .",
    "naturally @xmath40 induces two other locally - adaptable functions . indeed , suppose @xmath11 running over @xmath8 , so @xmath49 ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 , ( @xmath52 ) ) is a set where to each pair @xmath53 corresponds a distinct @xmath54 .",
    "we have thus @xmath55 and @xmath56 , such that @xmath57 and @xmath58 . by construction @xmath59",
    "for the coin version , the states are defined on the graph nodes @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 s labeling the edges attached to @xmath3 can be associated to the quantum numbers representing the different `` outgoing '' directions leaving @xmath3 , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "2 ( a ) . hence",
    ", we have as the base states @xmath60 , where for each @xmath3 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which spans the hilbert space @xmath63 .",
    "to establish the system dynamics , we first consider the shift operator @xmath64 ( and its adjoint @xmath65 @xcite ) , such that @xmath66 ) , it follows that @xmath67 in @xmath68 .",
    "then , for each @xmath3 , let @xmath69 to be a `` coin '' operator , represented by a @xmath70 unitary matrix , whose action over a basis state ( of quantum number @xmath3 ) is @xmath71 .",
    "finally , we set the unitary one step time evolution as @xcite @xmath72 which is valid for any topology ( encoded in the functions @xmath73 and @xmath36 ) and defines a very general time evolution for the problem through the functions @xmath40 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for the scattering version , note first that even for a same graph , the @xmath7 labeling @xcite for the scattering @xcite can be completely distinct than that for the coin formulation ( see figs .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) ) . thus , in principle the functions @xmath73 and",
    "@xmath36 can assume different values in the two cases ( and they will be distinguished when necessary ) .",
    "now , two quantum states are defined along each edge , e.g. , for the edge connecting the nodes @xmath3 and @xmath76 in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) , we denote the state `` incoming '' to the node @xmath3 ( @xmath76 ) by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) , which can be written also as @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "actually , for any edge , if one state is @xmath81 , the other is given by @xmath82 .",
    "so , the basis set is @xmath83 , spanning the hilbert space @xmath63 , as in the coin case .    for the dynamics , we set @xmath84 @xcite , where the action of the operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 are given by @xcite latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } r |j , \\sigma \\rangle_s & = & r_{\\sigma ,   \\ , \\sigma}^{(j ) }",
    "\\ ,    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "t |j , \\sigma \\rangle_s & = &   \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\lambda_{j } , \\ , \\alpha \\neq \\sigma }   t_{\\alpha ,   \\ , \\sigma}^{(j ) }   \\ ,      \\nonumber \\\\",
    "r^{\\dagger } |j , \\sigma \\rangle_s & = & r_{\\gamma(\\sigma ; j ) ,   \\",
    ", \\gamma(\\sigma ; j)}^{(e(\\sigma ; j ) ) \\ , \\mbox { * } }   \\ ,    \\nonumber \\\\",
    "t^{\\dagger } |j , \\sigma \\rangle_s & = & \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\lambda_{e(\\sigma ; j ) } , \\",
    ", \\alpha \\neq \\gamma(\\sigma ; j ) } t_{\\gamma(\\sigma ; j ) ,   \\ , \\alpha}^{(e(\\sigma ; j ) ) \\ , \\mbox { * } }   \\ ,      @xmath70 scattering matrices @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( for both @xmath91 in @xmath8 ) . if for all @xmath3 we impose that @xmath88 is unitary , then the coefficients @xmath92 and @xmath93 satisfy the usual relations in scattering theory @xcite .",
    "so , @xmath94 is unitary .",
    "for qw , stochasticity  in the classical sense  comes into play only through measurements , when one calculates the probabilities for the walker to be found in different locations along the graph @xcite .",
    "suppose we shall know at time @xmath95 what is the probability @xmath96 to be in the position state @xmath3 ( which means a node ( edge ) in the coin ( scattering ) model ) , regardless the value of the coin ( direction ) quantum number @xmath7 .",
    "so , we define the scattering and coin projector operators as @xmath97 the desired probability is thus the expected value @xmath98 for @xmath99 one of the expressions in eq .",
    "( [ projectors ] ) .",
    "for so , three steps are necessary : ( a ) to establish a correspondence between the different walks states ; ( b ) to properly associate their time evolutions ; and ( c ) to construct projector operators to obtain the probabilities of one in terms of the other .    regarding ( a ) , note that we always can define a locally - adaptable function @xmath100 , which for each node @xmath3 , maps the quantum number @xmath7 associated to a specific edge in the scattering formulation to the quantum number @xmath101 labeling the same edge , but in the coin formulation .",
    "for example , for the situation in fig .",
    "2 , we have @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . also , the actual @xmath7 s values are not relevant .",
    "they are just a way to label nodes and edges states .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , for any @xmath3 we always can rename one of the model states by @xmath106 for @xmath107 a bijection @xmath108 . choosing to retag the scattering case , we consider the following particular @xmath107 @xmath109 whose `` action '' is pictorially represented in fig .",
    "2 ( c ) .    then , using this new notation for the scattering states , one has the isomorphic unitary operator @xmath110  @xcite @xmath111 associating the scattering state @xmath7 incoming to @xmath3 to the coin state @xmath7 outgoing from @xmath3 ( see fig . 2 ( c ) ) .    for point",
    "( b ) , from the explicit form of @xmath112 and @xmath94 , one finds that by setting one of the two akin relations @xmath113 then , in both models the time evolution transition probability amplitudes are exactly the same . in this case , the resulting dynamics are unitary equivalent since @xmath114    finally , for ( c ) even if the two formulations are unitarily related , the resulting probabilities  through projections  are not @xcite .",
    "this is so because each description assumes distinct spatial configurations , nodes or edges , to characterize the system , thus not leading to same probabilities .",
    "in fact , in each edge the two scattering states are mapped by @xmath115 to coin states in different nodes .",
    "thus , the probability , eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) , to be in a unique node is not equal to the probability to be in a unique edge .",
    "however , there is a very direct way to obtain the walk probabilities for the coin ( scattering ) model from the scattering ( coin ) model .",
    "we just define @xmath116 then , suppose we construct a sqw with arbitrary @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s . by using @xmath117 of eq .",
    "( [ projectors ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ projection ] ) , we get the scattering walker probabilities at the step @xmath95 . but",
    "now if we use @xmath118 for this system , the resulting probabilities are exactly those from a coin model , for which the coin matrices elements are given by such @xmath92 s and @xmath93 s values according to the correspondence in eqs .",
    "( [ correspondence ] ) . the other way around , to get the scattering model results from the cqw , follows in the same fashion .",
    "although there are some few discussions in the literature on how to formulate discrete random walks in general terms @xcite , here we have developed a explicit procedure that allows one to write , in a constructive way , the time evolution operator directly from the system topology and local dynamics .",
    "it also includes the case of position dependent quantum amplitudes ( through the @xmath69 s and @xmath88 s ) .",
    "moreover , in the cqw case , it is not necessary all the matrices @xmath69 to have the dimensions equal to the largest coordination number of the graph , as in certain formulations @xcite .    in the present framework",
    ", a regular graph can be defined in terms of the @xmath8 s sizes ( e.g. , all equal to @xmath119 ) and the features of @xmath73 , @xmath36 and @xmath40 ( e.g. , independent on the @xmath3 s and having specific patterns along the graph ) .",
    "for instance , for all nodes with the same number of edges , we know that for the coin , @xmath68 can be written as the direct product of two subspaces , thus @xmath120 , as in @xcite .",
    "usually , it is believed that analytical methods are easier to implement for the sqw than for cqw @xcite .",
    "since in fact they can be mapped each other , the existing methods for the former should be extendable to the latter .",
    "our constructive approach may serve as a guide to implement such extensions @xcite .",
    "lastly , by using the cross operators in eq .",
    "( [ projections - mapping ] ) , we have been able to calculate  for different examples  the probabilities for sqw and cqw from a single implementation .",
