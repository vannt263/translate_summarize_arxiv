    "the euler - heisenberg effective action @xcite has been widely investigated in the last decades , in various contexts ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , studies related to the lorentz - symmetry violation @xcite have been considered so far in the context of photon splitting @xcite .",
    "the effective theory used in these analyses was mainly the lorentz - violating qed @xcite , a subset of the minimal standard - model extension @xcite .",
    "for an overview and references on this extended qed , see the review @xcite and the incomplete list of works @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in studying the radiative generation of the lorentz - violating euler - heisenberg action , from the cpt - even derivative term @xmath3 of the lorentz - violating qed extension .",
    "the cpt - odd term @xmath4 also generates nonlinear corrections to the maxwell theory , however , these calculations well be presented in a next work . with the exact expressions for these results we will be able to calculate specific scattering amplitudes , e.g. , the photon scattering in the electromagnet field of a nucleus ( delbrck scattering ) @xcite and the photon splitting in a strong magnetic field @xcite , in order to numerically estimate the coefficients for the lorentz violation .",
    "recently it has been argued that the photon - photon scattering ( also a process calculated from the results of the euler - heisenberg action ) can be observed at the large hadron collider @xcite as an opportunity to discuss the noncommutative interactions @xcite , among others , and therefore also the lorentz violation effects .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ nonperturbative ] we consider a nonperturbative calculation in the coefficient @xmath0 , by assuming rotational invariance in which @xmath0 is reduced to the product of timelike vectors .",
    "we also recover the results of the amplitude for vacuum photon splitting , previously obtained in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ perturbative ] we take into account the perturbative approach , where the coefficient @xmath0 is treated as a insertion in the propagator as well as a new vertex . sec .  [ summary ] contains a summary of out results .",
    "the starting fermion lagrangian that we are interested is given by @xmath5 where we have written @xmath6 and @xmath7 . as we have mentioned above , in our nonperturbative approach the coefficient @xmath0",
    "is reduced to the product of two unit timelike vectors , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the coefficient that determine the scale of lorentz violation .",

    "note that we have adopted dimensional regularization by extending the spacetime from @xmath46 to @xmath47 dimensions , so that @xmath48 goes to @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is an arbitrary parameter that identifies the mass scale .",
    "as we will see below , from these results ( [ t1b ] ) we will be able to obtain the lorentz - violating euler - heisenberg action in both nonperturbative and perturbative approaches .",
    "let us now recover the ( perturbative in @xmath0 ) amplitude obtained in @xcite for the photon triple splitting , from the above nonperturbative results ( [ t1b ] ) , in the collinear limit .",
    "for this , if we consider that the incident on - shell photon has energy @xmath51 and momentum @xmath52 , from the momentum conservation @xmath53 , we have the inequation @xmath54 then , as @xmath55 or @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 ) , in order to also satisfy the energy conservation @xmath58 , all the momenta @xmath59 must be aligned",
    ". therefore , the incident photon and the decay photons must be collinear , such that the four - momenta of all photons are mutually orthogonal , @xmath60 . by considering that these four - momenta are proportional to some four - momentum @xmath61 ,",

    "for this , we must calculate @xmath84 ( eq .  ( [ g ] ) ) without regard to the collinear limit .",
    "thus , as pointed out at the beginning , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are obtained from @xmath76 , when we interchange the uncontracted indices as well as the momentum indices , see eq .",

    "the above result is somewhat unusual , although it resembles the conventional euler - heisenberg action @xcite . from this expression ( [ seh2 ] ) ( or from the equations ( [ t1b ] ) ) we are now able to calculate some scattering amplitudes of interest in the presence of lorentz violation ( see sec .",
    "[ intro ] , for some proposals ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ seh2 ] ) is the leading term of the expansion of the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian , in the weak - field limit , which , written in terms of the dual field strength @xmath102 and the critical field strength @xmath103  v / cm , can be reexpressed as @xmath104 where @xmath105 with @xmath106 ( note that we have reinstated @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the electric and magnetic fields @xmath109 and @xmath110 are weak in comparison with the critical field @xmath111 .",
    "in fact , the limit @xmath112 is essential for the validity of the effective lagrangian as well as imposes severe restrictions on the real ( electron - positron ) pair production .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , for a more complete discussion .",
    "while the above expression  ( [ leh2 ] ) is sufficient to analyze the processes of ( four - photon ) box diagrams , for more external legs , we can infer from the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian the other expressions , e.g. , for ( six - photon ) hexagon diagrams , we can write @xmath113 where @xmath114 in particular , the lagrangiana ( [ leh3 ] ) is that responsible for the first non - zero contribution to the photon splitting in an ( constant and spatially uniform ) external magnetic field @xmath115  @xcite , in which @xmath116  g ( i.e. , a strong field ) .",
    "the limit of very strong magnetic fields ( @xmath117 ) is also interesting , however , it must be taken into account in the complete euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian .",
    "we believe that the lorentz - violating version of this effective lagrangian resembles its original shape , except for the overall factor @xmath33 and for the field strength @xmath118 and its dual . nevertheless , this will be confirmed in a forthcoming study .    in general , calculations involving lorentz violation are performed in the first order of the coefficient that controls the violation .",
    "thus , by expanding the action  ( [ seh2 ] ) up to first order in @xmath10 , we obtain @xmath119 where we have introduced the coefficient @xmath120 , given by @xmath121    in the next section we will see that the second and third contributions of eq .",
    "( [ seh3 ] ) are in fact found from the perturbative approach , however , for a generic coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting point about the decomposition of  @xmath120 ( eq .  ( [ kf ] ) ) , in terms of a symmetry tensor @xmath0 , is that it is also found in the born - infeld electrodynamics , with an ( lorentz - violating ) external field @xcite . in particular",
    ", this decomposition restricts the lorentz - violating electrodynamics to a nonbirefringence sector @xcite .",
    "in order to take into account the perturbative approach , let us first rewrite the fermion lagrangian ( [ l ] ) as follows @xmath122 in which , from now on , @xmath0 is a generic coefficient for lorentz violation .",
    "now , by expanding the propagator up to first order in @xmath0 , @xmath123 so that we can consider @xmath124 as a insertion in the propagator @xmath125 , and treating the last term in  ( [ l2 ] ) as a new vertex , the effective action ( [ seff ] ) then becomes @xmath126 with @xmath127 where now each graph above is subdivided into eight graphs , @xmath128 given by @xmath129 @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 once more , it is easy to see that @xmath133 and @xmath134 are obtained from @xmath135 , as well as @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 from @xmath139 , when we also perform the ciclic interchanges :    [ tc1234 ] @xmath140    therefore , we must focus our attention on the two graphs of @xmath139 ( eq .",

    "<S> in this work , we study the radiative generation of the lorentz - violating euler - heisenberg action , in the weak field approximation . for this , we first consider a nonperturbative calculation in the coefficient @xmath0 , however , by assuming rotational invariance . within this approach </S>",
    "<S> , we also obtain the results of the amplitude for the photon triple splitting . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we take into account the perturbative approach , where @xmath0 is treated as a insertion in the propagator and a new vertex . </S>",
    "<S> the partial results are in fact an expansion up to first order in @xmath0 of the nonperturbative ones , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggest that the complete results obtained in the nonperturbative approach can be used in both treatments . </S>"
