    "the study of different algebraic structures using graph theory becomes an exciting research topic in the last few decades , leading to many fascinating results and questions , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "given an algebraic structure @xmath20 , there are different formulations to associate a directed or undirected graph to @xmath20 , and we can study the algebraic properties of @xmath20 in terms of properties of associated graphs .",
    "the directed power graph of a semigroup was introduced by kelarev and quinn @xcite .",
