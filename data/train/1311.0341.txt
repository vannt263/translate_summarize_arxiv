    "dray , huerta , and kincaid showed first  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) how to relate @xmath5 to @xmath6 , and later  @xcite extended their treatment to the full @xmath4 magic square of lie groups in table  [ 2x2 ] . in the third row ,",
    "their clifford algebra description of @xmath7 is equivalent to a symplectic description as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 .",
    "explicitly , they represent @xmath10 , where @xmath11 , in terms of actions on @xmath12 matrices of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a @xmath4 hermitian matrix over @xmath15 , representing @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes the @xmath4 identity matrix , and tilde denotes trace - reversal , that is , @xmath19",
    ". the matrix @xmath20 can be thought of as the upper right @xmath12 block of an @xmath21 clifford algebra representation , and the action of @xmath10 on @xmath20 is obtained as usual from ( the restriction of ) the quadratic elements of the clifford algebra .",
    "the generators @xmath22 can be chosen so that the action takes the form @xmath23 where the case - dependent signs are related to the restriction from @xmath21 matrices to @xmath12 matrices .",
    "following sudbery  @xcite , we define the elements @xmath24 of the symplectic lie algebra @xmath25 by the condition @xmath26 where @xmath27 solutions of  ( [ sp4def ] ) take the form , corresponding to @xmath28 .",

    "[ dilemma ]    from  ( [ e7mat ] ) , we have @xmath109 with the sign being negative for @xmath110 and positive for @xmath111 .",
    "thus ,  ( [ pact ] ) becomes @xmath112 where the signs depend on which of @xmath113 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 are `` small '' ( @xmath114 ) or `` large '' ( @xmath115 ) . examining  ( [ pblocks ] ) , it is now easy to see that @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 , exactly as required by  ( [ freudx])([qfreud ] ) .",
    "if the elements of @xmath120 commute with those of @xmath89 , then the action of the translations @xmath121 and @xmath122 on @xmath89 is given by  ( [ pact ] ) .",
    "[ trlemma ]    set @xmath121 and consider the action of @xmath86 on @xmath45 , @xmath61 , @xmath71 , and @xmath46 , needing to verify  ( [ freudx])([qfreud ] ) with @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 . from",
    "( [ e7mat ] ) , we have @xmath126 since @xmath127 has one `` small '' index and one `` large '' index , it acts as a lowering operator , e.g.  mapping cubie @xmath96 to @xmath91 , and thus maps @xmath128 . in particular , this confirms the lack of a term involving @xmath127 in  ( [ qfreud ] ) . considering terms involving @xmath46 , we look at cubie @xmath95 , where the only nonzero term of  ( [ pact ] ) is @xmath129 which verifies  ( [ freudx ] ) in this case .",
    "we next look at cubie @xmath91 , where  ( [ pact ] ) becomes @xmath130 which is clearly antisymmetric , so we can use  ( [ eps6 ] ) and  ( [ sinv ] ) to obtain @xmath131 which is  ( [ pfreud ] ) , where we have used commutativity only in the last equality .",
    "finally , turning to cubie @xmath96 ,  ( [ pact ] ) becomes @xmath132 or equivalently , using  ( [ sinv ] ) and  ( [ cfreud ] ) , @xmath133 which is  ( [ freudy ] ) .",
    "this entire argument can be repeated with only minor changes if @xmath122 .    over @xmath134 or @xmath53 ,",
    "we re done ; lemmas  [ e6lemma ] ,  [ dilemma ] , and  [ trlemma ] together suffice to show that the action  ( [ pact ] ) is the same as the freudenthal action  ( [ freudx])([qfreud ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , the action  ( [ pact ] ) fails to satisfy the jacobi identity over @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "however , we can still use lemmas  [ e6lemma ] ,  [ dilemma ] , and  [ trlemma ] to reproduce the freudenthal action in those cases , as follows .",
    "the action of @xmath137 on @xmath89 is determined by @xmath138 when acting on elements of the form  ( [ pblocks ] ) , which extends to all of @xmath0 by antisymmetry .",
    "[ e6lemma2 ]    from  ( [ e7mat ] ) , we have @xmath139 inserting  ( [ thetaphi ] ) into  ( [ cubeact ] ) now yields precisely  ( [ e6cact ] ) when acting on @xmath61 ; the argument for the action on @xmath71 is similar .",
    "furthermore , using a argument similar to that used to prove lemma  [ e6lemma ] to begin with ,  ( [ pact ] ) acts on @xmath45 via @xmath140 which is completely antisymmetric in @xmath113 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and therefore proportional to @xmath141 . the argument for",
    "the action on @xmath46 is similar , with @xmath142 replaced by @xmath84 .",
    "although  ( [ cubeact ] ) itself is only antisymmetric in its last two indices , that suffices to define an action on cubies @xmath91 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath92 ; the action on the remaining 4 cubies is uniquely determined by requiring that antisymmetry be preserved .",
    "we now have all the pieces , and can state our main result .",
    "the lie algebra @xmath0 acts symplectically on cubes , that is , @xmath143 acts on cubes via  ( [ cubeact ] ) , as do real translations and the dilation , and all other @xmath0 transformations can then be constructed from these transformations using linear combinations and commutators .",
    "[ thm ]    lemmas  [ dilemma ] and  [ trlemma ] are unchanged by the use of  ( [ cubeact ] ) rather than  ( [ pact ] ) , since the components of @xmath86 commute with those of @xmath89 in both cases , and lemma  [ e6lemma2 ] verifies that @xmath144 acts via  ( [ cubeact ] ) , as claimed .",
    "it only remains to show that the remaining generators of @xmath0 can be obtained from these elements via commutators .",
    "using  ( [ freudx])([qfreud ] ) , it is straightforward to compute the commutator of two @xmath0 transformations of the form  ( [ thetadef ] ) .",
    "letting @xmath145 be a boost , so that @xmath146 and @xmath147 , and using the identity @xmath148 for any @xmath149 , we obtain @xmath150 = ( 0,0,{{\\cal a}}\\circ{{\\cal q}},0)\\ ] ] we can therefore obtain the null translation @xmath151 for any _ tracefree _ albert algebra element @xmath152 as the commutator of @xmath153 and @xmath154 ; a similar argument can be used to construct the null translation @xmath155 .",
    "thus , _ all _ generators of @xmath0 can be implemented either as a symplectic transformation on cubes via  ( [ cubeact ] ) , or as the commutator of two such transformations .",
    "we have showed that the algebraic description of the minimal representation of @xmath156 introduced by freudenthal naturally corresponds geometrically to a symplectic structure . along the way , we have emphasized both the similarities and differences between @xmath0 and @xmath157 .",
    "both of these algebras are _ conformal _ ; their elements divide naturally into generalized rotations ( @xmath144 or @xmath158 , respectively ) , translations , and a dilation . both act naturally on a representation built out of vectors ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 hermitian octonionic matrices , respectively ) , together with two additional real degrees of freedom ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . in the @xmath4 case ,",
    "the representation  ( [ pdef ] ) contains just one vector ; in the @xmath3 case  ( [ pcdef ] ) , there are two .",
    "this at first puzzling difference is fully explained by expressing both representations as antisymmetric tensors , as in  ( [ squarie ] ) and  ( [ pblocks ] ) , respectively , and as shown geometrically in figures  [ square ] and  [ cube ] .    in the complex case",
    ", we have shown that the symplectic action  ( [ pact ] ) exactly reproduces the freudenthal action  ( [ freudx])([qfreud ] ) .",
    "the analogy goes even further . in @xmath159 dimensions",
    ", there is a natural map taking two @xmath78-forms to a @xmath160 matrix .",
    "when acting on @xmath89 , this map takes the form @xmath161 where @xmath162 now denotes the volume element in six dimensions , that is , the completely antisymmetric tensor with @xmath163 .",
    "it is not hard to verify that , in the complex case ,  ( [ pstarp ] ) is ( a multiple of ) @xmath164 , as given by  ( [ pstarp0])([pstarp4 ] ) .",
    "similarly , the quartic invariant  ( [ quartic ] ) can be expressed in the complex case as @xmath165 up to an overall factor .",
    "neither the form of the action  ( [ pact ] ) , nor the expressions  ( [ pstarp ] ) and  ( [ quarticc ] ) , hold over @xmath135 or @xmath136 .",
    "this failure should not be a surprise , as trilinear tensor products are not well defined over @xmath135 , let alone @xmath136 .",
    "nonetheless , theorem  [ thm ] does tell us how to extend  ( [ pact ] ) to the octonions .",
    "although it is also possible to write down versions of  ( [ pstarp ] ) and  ( [ quarticc ] ) that hold over the octonions , by using case - dependent algorithms to determine the order of multiplication , it is not clear that such expressions have any advantage over the original expressions  ( [ pstarp0])([pstarp4 ] ) and  ( [ quartic ] ) given by freudenthal .    despite these drawbacks ,",
    "it is clear from our construction that @xmath0 should be regarded as a natural generalization of the traditional notion of a symplectic lie algebra , and fully deserves the name @xmath166",
