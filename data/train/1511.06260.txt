    "of all towers of the world , the one we would contemplate far more admiringly if it were lower rather than higher , is a tower in logic .",
    "it is the stack of exponentials defining the worst - case complexity of cut - elimination , normalization and dialogues between strategies interpreting first - order proofs @xcite : @xmath0 the tower s height is measured by the rank @xmath1 of the proof , which is in sequent calculus the highest among the logical complexities of the proof cut - formulas and in natural deduction the highest among the type complexities of the proof redexes ; @xmath2 is just the proof height .",
    "given the use of complex cuts and redexes in logical derivations , it does not take too much to reach astronomical worst - case bounds .",
    "yet , thanks to the famous curry - howard correspondence @xcite , we know that logical proofs , both in natural deduction @xcite and in sequent calculus @xcite , can be seen as programs of some typed functional programming language . and in the new york of a programming language",
    ", many inhabitants are indeed to be found on the highest floors of the highest skyscrapers , but the vast majority of them live in far lower buildings . that s programming : one can write enormously complex programs , but also very simple and efficient ones . having complexity bounds only for the very worst case of the very worst program is of no use when one looks for a more precise idea of how much time it takes a particular program to terminate its execution . unless one is terribly unlucky",
    ", his actual programs will take much less time than the worst possible program to complete their computations .",
    "how much less ? we need to measure precisely the tower of exponentials , because it is its height that is to blame for the unrealistic bounds it computes .",
    "the reason why the worst - case analysis of cut - elimination fares so roughly on average is the complexity measure adopted : the rank of the proof is a superficial information , in a literal sense . indeed , one looks only at the surface of a cut , the cut - formula , without caring about how the formula is used in the proof .",
    "it is like trying to determine the maximum speed of a car just by studying its outward appearance , while ignoring completely its internal engine ! but what is the engine of a cut ?",
    "what is the real responsible of the worst - case complexity bounds , the mechanism that determines the height of the tower of exponentials ?",
    "it turns out that the laws governing the complexity of cut - elimination are written in a game semantical language .",
    "if we want to answer our questions , we have no choice : we must translate them in terms of games and strategies . in the quest for a better complexity measure of cut - elimination and normalization",
    ", the single most important tool is then _",
    "game semantics_. game semantics was in the background of logic at least since herbrand s theorem : this is clear by miller s formulation of it using expansion trees @xcite , that is , game strategies , as remarked by heijltjes @xcite .",
    "but the idea of interpreting formulas as games and proofs as winning strategies , appeared time and again in the history of logic : in gentzen s and novikoff s proofs of consistency of arithmetic ( see @xcite ) , in gdel s and kreisel s functional interpretations ( see @xcite ) , in lorenzen s game semantics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the old , _ statical _ game semantics was brought to a new life with the invention of the modern , _ dynamical _ game semantics , initiated by coquand s @xcite discovery that cut - elimination in arithmetic mirrors a debate between two strategies . as opposed to ordinary games",
    ", players may every now and then revise their moves and backtrack to a previous position .",
    "coquand proved by elegant combinatorial means that the dialogues between strategies interpreting proofs always terminate , thus proving as well the termination of cut - elimination , as later shown by herbelin @xcite .",
    "the advantage of game semantics is that it ignores inessential aspects of proofs and turns the spotlight to their geometrical structure .",
    "hyland and ong @xcite took coquand - style game semantics to a new level .",
    "the key move is realizing that one can drop altogether winning conditions : debates need not always terminate with the win or the loss of one of the two players .",
    "game semantics can in such a way model pure dialogues , exchanges of answers and questions , as those occurring during the evaluation of a functional program .",
    "the linear head reduction strategy of typed lambda terms can thus be modeled as a debate between strategies @xcite .",
    "thanks to these and several other insights , hyland and ong discovered how to construct fully abstract models for typed functional languages ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as plays correspond to cut - elimination @xcite and normalization @xcite , one encounters in game semantics the same complexity estimates .",
    "the rank of a cut - formula becomes the depth of the game arena , and the very same tower of exponentials that bounds cut - elimination , bounds also the dialogues between strategies corresponding to first - order proofs .",
    "the result was proved by clairambault @xcite ; it constitutes an important demonstration that game semantics may serve as a viable complexity analysis tool .",
    "nevertheless , the depth of game arenas is not a precise complexity measure for the same reasons we discussed above : it corresponds just to the rank of cut - formulas .",
    "it may appear that game semantics is leading us nowhere .",
    "for the moment we hardly achieved anything but to translate doubts and questions from one language to another .",
    "what is the engine of a strategy ? how to measure its complexity ?",
    "we are missing a piece of the puzzle and to get it , we need to make two long jumps : one backward and the other forward .",
    "debates in game semantics can be extremely involved ; proving their termination , like escaping from an intricate labyrinth with no ariadne s thread at hand .",
    "coquand eventually overcame these difficulties by inventing a notation with deep geometrical properties : pointer sequences .",
    "but in a preliminary effort @xcite to establish his successive termination result @xcite , he settled for a weaker one : that debates between _ simple _ backtracking strategies , now called _ @xmath3-backtracking strategies _ , always terminate . according to coquand ,",
    "a @xmath3-backtracking strategy `` never changes its mind about a value it has previously considered wrong '' .",
    "this kind of strategies are by design less involved than general ones and their debates are more predictable ; that allowed coquand to get away at least with some result from his first struggle .",
    "the idea of classifying strategies according to some complexity measure had an extraordinary potential , yet it was completely abandoned . only much later , did berardi and",
    "deliguoro @xcite generalize the concept of @xmath3-backtracking to the more general _ @xmath4-backtracking _ for any @xmath5 .",
    "it was a major conceptual advancement .",
    "their definition is inspired by gold s learning theory @xcite and by the berardi - coquand - hayashi @xcite notion of @xmath4-backtracking game ",
    "an alternative to coquand and hyland - ong games up to now only partially explored .",
    "however , it was not at all obvious how to formulate a notion of @xmath4-backtracking strategy in coquand and hyland - ong games as well , which is what they did .",
    "+ the definition is logically complex and has a geometrical and temporal flavour , but its meaning is simple to grasp . for example , a strategy is @xmath6-backtracking if it is allowed to change its mind about previous mind changes of level @xmath3 .",
    "that reminds us of some juridical systems : only a judge of second level can change the decision of a judge of level one .",
    "thus a judge of an appeal court can very well revise an ordinary judge s decision , but two ordinary judges can not question each other s sentences .",
    "with coquand - hyland - ong pointer notation , a mind change of level @xmath3 is represented by a move pointing backward : @xmath7   ( c ) edge ( a ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] a mind change of level @xmath6 can be depicted as a crossing : @xmath8   ( d ) edge ( b ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( c ) edge ( a ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] though they are _ not _ physically removed , we consider the moves between the ending points of a pointer to be _ ideally _ erased by the mind change .",
    "thus , the move @xmath9 is a first mind change erasing the moves before itself and after @xmath10 ; the move @xmath11 _ is a mind change about the first mind change _ and recovers one of the formerly retracted moves , @xmath12 .",
    "there is a proviso : for the move @xmath13 to be considered a _",
    "real _ mind change of level @xmath6 , at the moment @xmath13 is played the pointer from @xmath14 must be _ active _ : a pointer is active if it is crossed only by inactive pointers ; a pointer is inactive if there is an active pointer crossing it . by considering mind changes about mind changes about mind changes ...",
    "one arrives at the concept of @xmath4-backtracking . a @xmath4-backtracking strategy has backtracking level @xmath15 .",
    "we shall have to describe precisely the notion and familiarize extensively with it in the following .",
    "for the moment it is enough to say that the backtracking level is a measure of how much involved and intricate the geometrical structure of a strategy is .",
    "the backtracking level is also easy to compute : if a strategy interprets a first - order proof or a simply typed lambda term , one can determine its backtracking level in plain quadratic time , and we conjecture linear .",
    "we have found the complexity measure we were looking for : it is the backtracking level of a strategy .",
    "we shall prove that the height of the tower of exponentials bounding the length of interactions between strategies is determined by the backtracking level of the strategies .",
    "the explanation of this complexity result is our paper s + * fundamental thesis * : _ the real engine of a strategy is its backtracking mechanism ; the power of this engine is measured by the strategy s backtracking level ; the higher the backtracking level , the more involved the geometrical structure of the backtracking mechanism is and the longer it will take to conclude a debate with the strategy_. + as a consequence of our thesis , at first we conjectured a weaker result than the one presented here , which was : if we consider two strategies with backtracking level respectively @xmath4 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the size of the two strategies is bounded by @xmath2 , then the complexity bound for the length of any interaction between them is @xmath18 this estimate already outperforms the old ones , because the backtracking level of a strategy is completely independent of the arena depth .",
    "a @xmath6-backtracking strategy can live in an arena of depth @xmath19 ; then one has a new bound given by a tower of exponentials of height @xmath20 versus an old one of height @xmath21 . moreover , as we shall see , the backtracking level of a strategy is bound by the depth of the arena , modulo a trivial transformation .",
    "that explains perfectly why the rank of a proof worked as a worst - case complexity measure ; in a sense , one looked at the right place , without knowing the good reason .",
    "our fundamental thesis seemed to suggest that our first conjecture was already optimal .",
    "for example , one would expect that when a @xmath22-backtracking strategy interacts with a @xmath3-backtracking one , the debate should take in general no less time than prescribed by a tower of exponential of height @xmath23 .",
    "we were struck when we found that the case it s not .",
    "the complexity bound in this situation is much tighter : a tower of height @xmath6 , that is just an exponential @xmath24 and @xmath3-backtracking strategies are no fortunate exceptions .",
    "if a @xmath22-backtracking strategy interacts with a @xmath6-backtracking one , the complexity bound is just a tower of height @xmath20 , a double exponential : @xmath25 more in general , given two strategies of backtracking level respectively @xmath4 and @xmath16 and of size less than @xmath2 , we shall prove that the length of their interaction is determined by the _",
    "minimum _ among their backtracking levels , that is by @xmath26 , and will be less than @xmath18 we can interpret this result as a _ safety of interactions _ result .",
    "no matter how unpredictable and complex the context in which a strategy is thrown in , the strategy will always have safe interactions , from the complexity point of view , whose rate of growth is determined by the strategy s own backtracking level .",
    "one may acknowledge that indeed the concept of @xmath4-backtracking provides the means for a very refined analysis of the length of dialogues in logic , but still have the suspicions that the analysis is of no practical consequence .",
    "are there around enough @xmath3-backtracking strategies , @xmath6-backtracking strategies and so on , or are they odd entities appearing , like the 29th of february , once in every four years of logical and mathematical practice ?",
    "are almost all formulas of complexity @xmath4 going to have only @xmath4-backtracking winning strategies ?",
    "the answer is no . in arithmetic",
    "the landscape is already partially studied , thanks to the correspondence between the excluded middle @xmath27 over formulas with @xmath4 quantifiers and the concept of learning . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , by means of interactive realizability @xcite , that every arithmetical proof using only @xmath28 as classical principle represents a winning recursive strategy for the related @xmath3-backtracking game in the sense of @xcite . in @xcite",
    "was proved  in a less refined way  that any arithmetical formula derivable using @xmath27 as a classical principle , has a winning recursive strategy in @xmath4-backtracking games .",
    "as these results are very likely to hold also for first - order logic in the formulation of @xcite , it is clear that strategies of low backtracking level are the norm rather than the exception .",
    "moreover , as a matter of fact many theorems in arithmetic are proved just by using @xmath28 and many theorems in analysis with @xmath29 .",
    "the results of this work also definitely confirm a point that has been made several times @xcite : proofs limited to @xmath28 or @xmath29 yield relatively efficient strategies , and in general the _ learning theory _ is the correct one to understand and improve the complexity of programs extracted from classical proofs .",
    "the surprise , here , is the connection with the complexity of intuitionistic proofs as well .      in this paper",
    "we establish the discussed bounds on the interaction lengths between visible bounded strategies in coquand and hyland - ong game semantics .",
    "they will certainly lead to new bounds also for cut - elimination , normalization and dialogues between expansion trees in first - order logic ; but given the great generality of game semantics , our results are interesting in their own right . for space reasons",
    ", we will not study in detail concrete applications and we delay the matter to forthcoming papers .",
    "as explained in @xcite , however , bounds in game semantics automatically translate into bounds for linear head reduction in typed lambda calculus .",
    "there is also herbelin s result @xcite , showing a step - by - step correspondence between plays in game semantics and the weak head reduction cut - elimination strategy in an infinitary sequent calculus for arithmetic .",
    "the situation in first - order logic is a bit subtler , because atomic formulas are undecidable , thus winning conditions must be different ; yet we do not see major obstacles to adapting herbelin s methods also to that setting .",
    "we devote the introductory part of the paper to recalling the game semantical ideas of coquand , hyland - ong and berardi - deliguoro , with new examples and viewpoints that we feel are essential to understand the technical part of the paper .",
    "in particular , in section ",
    "[ sec - cho ] , we describe the main concepts of coquand and hyland - ong game semantics and study an example based on miller s expansion trees . in section  [ sec - backtrackinglev ] , we explain in detail the berardi - deliguoro notion of backtracking level of a strategy . in section  [ sec - proofidea ] , we outline our proof plan , which is carried out in detail in sections ",
    "[ sec - maxmin ] ,  [ sec - trimm ] ,  [ sec - bounds ] ,  [ sec - gadget ] .",
    "as wadler @xcite put it , `` curry - howard is a double - barrelled name which ensures the existence of other double - barrelled names '' . since logical proofs",
    "are isomorphic to computer programs , many concepts happen to be discovered twice : once in logic , once in computer science .",
    "girard - reynolds system @xmath30 is an example , coquand - hyland - ong game semantics is another .",
    "actually , most literature on game semantics fails to mention that coquand and hyland - ong game semantics are by no means different concepts but just _ one _ semantics that turns out to have several applications : cut - elimination in the case of coquand , denotational semantics for typed lambda calculus in the case of hyland - ong . since the latter has in turn as many variants as functional languages out there , to avoid the _ one , none , one hundred thousand _ pirandellian fragmentation , we adopt the most abstract hyland - ong terminology ( see @xcite ) , calling it coquand - hyland - ong game semantics . arenas are the structures where games take place . as in many real - life two - player games , there are a set of moves @xmath31 and a binary relation of justification @xmath32 between moves .",
    "the elements of @xmath31 may represent elementary actions of a player , like moving a single piece in chess or choosing a witness in logical dialogues ; but they may also encode complex positions , like the entire chessboard or a full logical formula . often a game can be formalized in both ways .",
    "the relation @xmath32 tells whether a move is a direct answer to another one or whether from a configuration of the game a player can pass to another .",
    "every move is labeled by a function @xmath33 as either player or opponent move , and there are special initial moves that start the game .",
    "an * arena * @xmath34 is a structure @xmath35 such that :    * @xmath36 is a graph : @xmath31 is a set of nodes , called * moves * , and @xmath32 is a binary relation over @xmath31 , called * enabling*. if @xmath37 , then @xmath16 is said to * justify * @xmath4 and @xmath4 is said to * answer * @xmath16 .",
    "* @xmath38 is a function indicating whether any move @xmath16 is a player move or an opponent move and is such that for every @xmath39 , @xmath40 , which is called the * alternation condition*. * @xmath41 is a subset of @xmath31 called the set of * initial moves * and is such that for every @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we assume @xmath44 . *",
    "a * simple play * over @xmath34 is any sequence of moves @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 and represents a backtracking free play .",
    "* @xmath34 is said to be of * finite depth * whenever there exists a @xmath48 such that no simple play over @xmath34 is of length greater than @xmath2 ; in this case , @xmath2 is said to be the * depth * of @xmath34 .",
    "+    when we shall want to talk about a player without specifying who he is , we will call him player @xmath49 and the other player will be @xmath50 ; that is , if @xmath51 , then @xmath52 and if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 .",
    "often moves will be denoted with white @xmath55 or black @xmath56 circles , that may be indexed ; in a play , player and opponent moves will always be represented with different colors",
    ". concatenations of sequences @xmath57 and @xmath58 of moves will just be denoted as @xmath59 .",
    "an * initial segment * of a sequence @xmath60 is any prefix @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "so far , we have described just a standard game : we have considered only _ simple _ plays , where players move in an alternating fashion and each player immediately answers the last move of the opponent .",
    "a simple play in chess would be : @xmath631.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 3.nxe5 , which means moving in order a white pawn to e4 , a black pawn to e5 , a white knight on f3 , a black knight on f6 and taking the pawn on e5 with the white knight .",
    "graphically , with arrows representing the justification relation @xmath32 , one has : @xmath64   ( x ) edge ( 0 ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( a ) edge ( x ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( b ) edge ( a ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( c ) edge ( b ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( d ) edge ( c ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] when interpreting dialogues in logic and computer science , however , it is necessary to allow players to delay answers , take back moves , backtrack to a previous opponent move and answer differently .",
    "all of that can be represented by an act of answering a previous move with a pointer .",
    "for example , black , instead of answering the move 3.nxe5 , may change his mind and answer differently the move 2.nf3 by placing his knight to c6 : @xmath65   ( x ) edge ( 0 ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( a ) edge ( x ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( b ) edge ( a ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( c ) edge ( b ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( d ) edge ( c ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( e ) edge ( b ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] globally , there are now two plays on the board : @xmath631.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 3.nxe5 and @xmath631.e4 e5 2.nf3 nc6 .",
    "the play might go on like this @xmath66   ( x ) edge ( 0 ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( a ) edge ( x ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( b ) edge ( a ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( c ) edge ( b ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( d ) edge ( c ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( e ) edge ( b ) ; \\draw[-latex , right ]   ( f ) edge ( e ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( g ) edge ( d ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] the plays on the board are now : @xmath631.e4 e5 2.nf3 nf6 3.nxe5 d6 and @xmath631.e4 e5 2.nf3 nc6 3.e5 .",
    "we can see in the example above the two different characters that backtracking moves may possess : the move d6 is a delayed first answer to nxe5 and represents a mind change about which game line to play ; the move nc6 is a second answer to nf3 and represents a mind change about how to answer a move that was already answered . as for our purposes",
    "it would be useless to take account of that difference , we shall regard each backtracking move as a mind change , without further distinctions .",
    "+ now we turn to a crucial concept , that of _ view _ : a backtracking strategy needs to know what part of the game history to consider when deciding a new move . in any game , what really matters from the perspective of a player is : starting with a move , waiting for an answer , making a move , waiting for an answer , making a move , waiting for an answer and so on ... the kind of strategy that arises from the interpretation of proofs and programs , just needs this sequence of move - answer , move - answer , move - answer ... in order to decide the next move .",
    "the view of white in the last game above is thus : @xmath63 e4 e5 nf3 nf6 nxe5 d6 . in general , to determine the current view , a player looks at the last move of the opponent , then follows the pointer to the move that was answered , then consider the immediately preceding move , then follows the pointer to another move and so on ... until an initial move is reached . in the picture @xmath67   ( b1 ) edge ( c1 ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( b2 ) edge ( c2 ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( bk ) edge ( z ) ; \\draw[-latex , bend right ]   ( bk-1 ) edge ( ck-1 ) ; \\end{tikzpicture}\\ ] ] the displayed moves , where @xmath56 may or may not appear , represent the view of the player with the obligation to play after the last move @xmath10 .",

    "it does not matter whether the reactions were ignoring the move altogether or answering it , the player has now changed his mind : either he has chosen to stop ignoring the move and answer it , or he decided to answer it differently .",
    "so , everything that was generated starting from his first former reaction no longer interests him , and he discards that part of the history .",
    "to continue the discussion we need the concept of crossing edges .",

    "the point is that the first edge is _ active _ at the moment the second edge is played , while it could be _ inactive _ , i.e. not `` existing '' , when the third edge is played .",

    ", we can make a refined induction on the backtracking level of the principal player of the play , thus obtaining a tower of exponential possibly much lower than the old , well - known one .",
    "however , we shall need a lot of technical preparatory study to make our proof strategy succeed .",
    "the fact that one can focus just on the principal player of a play is surprising .",
    "actually , it may seem a stroke of luck that such an argument can work , because it faces many obstructions that we are going to describe in a moment .",
    "as a matter of fact , we discovered our results by means of a more intuitive geometrical proof ; as it was much more difficult to formalize , we discarded it and turned to the present approach .",
    "the * first obstacle * to address is the following . given a visible play , consider the edges from the moves of _ maximal _ backtracking level among those made by the principal player @xmath180 , that is the one with _",
    "minimal _ backtracking level in the play : can these edges be crossed ?",
    "it is not trivial that they do not  let alone that they can assume the role that orphan moves have in coquand s proof . since the other player @xmath238 may have backtracking level greater than that of @xmath180 , the edge from some @xmath238-move could in principle cross and inactivate the edge from a @xmath180-move of maximal backtracking level _ among those of",

    "therefore , we need to prove that this can not happen : it will be a task of section  [ sec - maxmin ] .",

    "the * third obstacle * to address is whether the trimming operation really transforms a visible play , first of all , into a visible play , secondly , into a play in which the principal player of the initial play has backtracking level strictly smaller . in coquand",
    "s proof the trimming operation is easily shown to transform visible plays into visible plays ; in our proof we shall have to investigate in depth the shape of views to check that it is the case .",

    "there is a last tricky * fourth obstacle * to address .",
    "what if a strategy has backtracking level greater than the depth of the arena ?",
    "this is a curious situation , but the answer is essentially : such a strategy is _ badly defined_. section ",
    "[ sec - gadget ] will settle the matter : it will be shown that inserting some dummy moves in a strategy , that form a sort of switch - on / switch - off graph - theoretic gadget , one can get a strategy of backtracking level less than or equal to the depth of the arena .",
    "the same can be done with an arbitrary play .",
    "this provides conclusive evidence that in principle , a strategy should never have backtracking level greater than the depth of the correspondent arena : if it does , it has been constructed in a careless manner .",
    "in this section we establish several key properties of the inactivation relation between edges , removing the first two obstacles in our way to the main results .",
    "namely , we shall see that the edges from the moves of maximal backtracking level , among those of one player , can not be crossed , let alone inactivated .",
    "moreover , we will show that any interaction between two strategies of backtracking level respectively @xmath4 and @xmath16 is a play of backtracking level less than or equal to the maximum among @xmath4 and @xmath16 and of real backtracking level less than or equal to the minimum among @xmath4 and @xmath16 . we shall call this property the max - min theorem of backtracking levels interaction .",
    "we start off by proving that only the very same player that made a still active backtracking can retract it with another backtracking : in other terms , he alone has the power to recover the moves that he himself `` erased '' .",
    "unless he decides that those moves have to be reconsidered , the other player will never be able to see them again . more precisely ,",
