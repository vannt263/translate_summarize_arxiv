    "however , topological states of quantum matter evade traditional symmetry - breaking classification schemes .",
    "instead they are described in the low - energy limit by topological field theories ( tft ) @xcite .",
    "recently , topological insulators ( tis ) have attracted great attention in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "these materials , among other unique electronic properties , display nontrivial topological order and are characterized by a fully insulating bulk and gapless edge or surface states , which are protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "in addition to their interesting electronic properties , tis also exhibit interesting properties in terms of their interaction with electromagnetic sources and fields , in contrast to ordinary insulators or conductors .",
    "most of these properties are a consequence of the topological magnetoelectric effect ( tme ) , which consists in the transmutation of the electric and magnetic induction fields , even in the case of static and stationary sources .",
    "the electromagnetic response of a conventional insulator is governed by maxwell s equations derived from the ordinary electromagnetic lagrangian @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "three - dimensional tis are well described by adding a term of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath1 is the topological magnetoelectric polarizability ( tmep ) @xcite .",
    "specific tmes that would result from this ( @xmath6)-dimensional tft have been predicted and they include : induced mirror magnetic monopole - like fields due to electric charges close to the surface of a ti ( and vice versa ) @xcite , a nontrivial faraday rotation of the polarizations of electromagnetic waves propagating through a tis surface @xcite and a tunable casimir repulsion between three - dimensional tis @xcite . however , none of these effects has yet been observed experimentally .",
    "a possible explanation for this is that in @xmath6 dimensions the @xmath1 term and the maxwell term are equally important at low energies .",
    "another possible explanation is that so far most experimental setups devised to measure these effects do not necessarily favor an eventual @xmath1 signal as fairly simple configurations have been considered .    to this end , in refs .",
    "@xcite we initiated a method to calculate the electromagnetic response of planar , spherical and cylindrical ideal tis under electromagnetic fields by means of green s functions ( gf ) . in those works , previously existing results have been recovered by generalizing the methods employed in the literature .",
    "that generalized description , however , was lacking a more thorough and realistic assessment of tis since we analyzed the idealized situation in which tis had neither dielectric nor permeable properties . from a practical point of view , the aforementioned results are instructive but not directly applicable",
    ". therefore the corresponding description of topologically insulating ponderable media is needed . in this work",
    "we aim to fill in this gap . following refs .",
    "@xcite we extend the gf method to study the tme of time - reversal ( tr ) invariant tis including its dielectric and permeable properties , for planar and spherical geometries .",
    "the work is structured as follows . in [ 3d - tis ]",
    "we briefly review the basics of the electromagnetic response of 3-dimensional tr invariant tis .",
    "is devoted to derive the gf for a planar ti occupying the semi - infinite region @xmath7 in contact with the vacuum , following closely the ref .",
    "this allows us to deal not only with a piecewise constant tme polarizability as we did in refs .",
    "@xcite but also with piecewise constant electric polarizability and magnetic permeability .",
    "the corresponding differential equations for the reduced gf fall into three groups .",
    "we solve the first group to illustrate the procedure , and the solutions for the remaining groups are left for [ appendix ] .",
    "we will also derive the gf in coordinate representation . in [ sec_spherti ] a similar calculation is done for the case of a spherical topological insulator .",
    "is dedicated to different applications , the problems of a pointlike electric charge , an infinitely straight current - carrying wire and an infinitely straight uniformly charged wire all three configurations in front of an infinitely planar ti . as a fourth application",
    "we then solve the pointlike charge in front of a spherical ti .",
    "finally , in [ discussion ] we emphasize the contribution of this work in regards its applicability in real situations and elaborate on some general features of the method and its results .",
    "we also discuss the physical interpretation of the gf in terms of the image electric and magnetic charge and current densities . throughout the paper ,",
    "lorentz - heaviside units are assumed ( @xmath8 ) , the metric signature will be taken as @xmath9 and the convention @xmath10 is adopted .",
    "the electromagnetic response of a conventional insulator is characterized by the dielectric permittivity @xmath11 and the magnetic permeability @xmath12 .",
    "an electric field induces an electric polarization , whereas a magnetic field induces a magnetic polarization . as both the electric field",
    "@xmath13 and the magnetic induction @xmath14 are well defined inside the insulator , the linear response of a conventional insulator in the presence of external electric charge @xmath15 and current @xmath16 densities is determined by the usual action @xcite from which the field equations and constitutive relations are derived . to describe the interaction between a 3d topologically insulating ponderable media with electromagnetic sources and fields ,",
    "the latter must be supplemented by the magneto - electric contribution @xcite .",
    "thus the action under consideration in this paper is @xmath17 .",

    "the partition function and all physical quantities are invariant under shifts of @xmath1 by any multiple of @xmath19 .",

    "one can therefore conclude that there are two different classes of tr invariant tis in 3d , the topologically trivial class with @xmath2 and the topologically nontrivial class with @xmath21 . in this work we will consider the nontrivial case only .    the maxwell s equations including the topological term are the usual ones @xmath22 with , however , modified constitutive relations , since @xmath1 is understood as an effective parameter much as @xmath11 and @xmath12 :    @xmath23    assuming that the time derivatives of the fields are finite in the vicinity of the surface @xmath24 of a nontrivial 3d ti in contact with a trivial insulator ( or vacuum ) , the maxwell s equations imply boundary conditions , which , for vanishing external sources on @xmath24 , read @xmath25 _ { \\sigma } \\cdot \\textbf{n } = \\tilde{\\theta } ( \\mathbf{b } \\cdot \\textbf{n } ) \\big| _ { \\sigma } \\quad & , \\quad \\left [ \\tfrac{1}{\\mu } \\mathbf{b } \\right ] _",

    "in this section we adapt the green s function method initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite to study the tme of tr invariant 3d tis endowed with dielectric and permeable properties .",
    "knowledge of the gf allows one to compute the electromagnetic fields for an arbitrary distribution of sources , as well as to solve problems with given dirichlet , neumann or robin boundary conditions on arbitrary surfaces .",
    "the advantages of the gf method are apparent in the case of ordinary electrodynamics of continuous media and so is the case for the electromagnetics of tis .",

    "@xcite , conceptual and computational virtues of the method were analyzed in the context of the casimir attraction between a ti and a conducting plate . for the method to be applicable in a real experimental situation , though",
    ", the dielectric and permeable properties of the tis must be taken into account .",
    "this implies a generalization of the method elaborated in refs .",
    "the subtleties arise as one needs to find the gf for a position dependent @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which we will take as piecewise constant functions , in analogy with the tmep @xmath1",
    ". this will be one of the main results of this work .",
    "since the homogeneous maxwell s equations that relate the potentials to the fields are not modified in the presence of the @xmath1 term , the electrostatic and magnetostatic fields can be written in terms of the electromagnetic 4-potential @xmath33 according to @xmath34 and @xmath14 , as usual . in the coulomb gauge @xmath35 ,",
    "the electromagnetic potentials satisfy the coupled equations of motion @xmath36 where @xmath37 . if the tmep is homogeneous , @xmath38 , the equations of motion for the scalar @xmath39 and vector @xmath40 potentials decouple ( since @xmath41 ) , and one finds that the propagation of the electromagnetic fields is the same as in a conventional insulator . as a consequence , electromagnetic waves propagating within a 3d ti retain their usual properties : dispersion is linear , the phase and group velocities are proportional to the refractive index , the fields are transverse and orthogonal polarizations do not mix @xcite .",
    "therefore , the effects of the @xmath1 term can be measured only when the tmep varies in space .",
    "let us restrict ourselves to the analysis of a planar ti .",
    "without loss of generality we choose our coordinates such that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the outward unit normal to @xmath24 which is located at @xmath44 .",
    "this represents the case of a homogeneous ti occupying the region @xmath7 in contact with the vacuum ( @xmath45 ) .",
