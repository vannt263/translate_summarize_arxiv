    "we model our approach after standard algorithms for configuration model ( cm ) networks  @xcite .",
    "cm networks are useful because all edges from a node are independent of one another , in the sense that whether an epidemic results from following one edge is independent of the result along any other edge because short cycles are negligible .",
    "we begin with @xmath2 nodes . to each node",
    "@xmath3 we assign two degrees , an _ independent edge _ degree @xmath4 and a triangle degree @xmath5 .",
    "the joint probability of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath3 will be part of @xmath5 triangles and have @xmath4 other edges",
    ". each triangle and edge from @xmath3 will be independent of other triangles and edges in the same way that edges in cm networks are independent .",
    "we create an independent stub list and a triangle stub list .",
    "we place @xmath3 into the independent stub list @xmath4 times and into the triangle stub list @xmath5 times .",
    "once all nodes are placed into the lists , we randomize them .",
    "we then take the pairs of nodes in positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 of the independent list and join them , and the triples in positions @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 and join them into a triangle . some repeated edges or loops or short cycles other than the triangles we impose",
    "may appear , but their impact is negligible as @xmath12  .",
    "this algorithm inevitably segregates those nodes with a high proportion of triangles from those nodes with a low proportion of triangles .",
    "if the degrees of nodes with many triangles differs from the degrees of nodes with few triangles , then this effect will cause correlation of different degrees . in order to understand the impact of clustering",
    ", we must be able to compare percolation in these clustered networks with percolation in networks whose nodes are segregated in the same way .      for comparative purposes we develop a corresponding unclustered network with the same segregation as the clustered networks . given the joint distribution @xmath6 of independent and triangle degrees , we create a new network where nodes are assigned _ blue _ and _ red _ degrees such that @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the joint distribution is given by @xmath15 .",
    "we proceed as before .",
    "we create a blue and red list , and pair nodes in positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the blue list and then repeat with the red list , joining pairs , not triples .",
    "the resulting network has the same segregation as the corresponding clustered network , but short cycles are negligible .",
    "@xmath1 is usually defined as the number of new infections caused by an average infected individual .",
    "occasionally alternate definitions are used , but in some way it represents the number of new infections attributed to an average infected individual .",
    "@xmath16 is the threshold below which epidemics are impossible ( _ i.e. _ , the percolated network has no giant component ) .",
    "if @xmath17 then epidemics are possible , but not guaranteed .      to simplify the analysis , first assume that @xmath3 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are members of a triangle and @xmath3 becomes infectious first . there are multiple ways that both @xmath18 and @xmath19 can become infected from edges within the triangle , but they all have the same impact on the epidemic .",
    "it is convenient to treat infections of @xmath18 and @xmath19 as if they came from from @xmath3 regardless of the actual path followed .    thus if @xmath3 becomes infected , then with probability @xmath20 it is credited with infecting both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and with probability @xmath21 it is credited with infecting just @xmath22 . with probability @xmath23",
    "it infects neither . in spirit",
    "this approach is similar to that of  @xcite . for book - keeping purposes ,",
    "we define the rank @xmath24 of a node as follows : the index case is given rank @xmath25 .",
    "each node @xmath18 is then assigned rank @xmath24 to be the shortest path from the index case to @xmath18 , bearing in mind the rule above for crediting infections .",
    "this allows us to define a @xmath26 next - generation matrix  @xcite .",
    "we separate those nodes infected along an independent edge from those nodes infected along a triangle edge  .",
    "we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 to be the number of infections that a node infected from an independent edge is expected to cause along independent and triangle edges respectively .",
    "we symmetrically define @xmath29 and @xmath30 . if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the number of nodes of rank @xmath24 which were infected along independent and triangle edges respectively , then @xmath33 where @xmath34 ,  @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix is @xmath1 .",
    "we generally want to determine @xmath0 such that @xmath38 .",
    "substituting @xmath16 into the characteristic equation gives @xmath39 the value @xmath40 that solves this equation is the threshold transmissibility below which epidemics are impossible .",
    "the original network has a giant component if @xmath17 when @xmath41 .",
    "thus the conditions for a giant component are @xmath42 and/or @xmath43 the only networks for which the first condition applies but not the second are networks with enough independent edges and triangle edges such that a giant component exists soley within the independent edges and a giant component exists soley within the triangle edges .",
    "we define @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the same manner , except that triangles need not be considered .",
    "then @xmath46 where @xmath47 ,  @xmath48 ,  @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "substituting @xmath16 into the characteristic equation finds the epidemic threshold @xmath51 the network has a giant component when @xmath52 and/or @xmath53 the difference between these conditions and those of the corresponding clustered network comes from the fact that @xmath54 . from this",
    "it can be shown that the epidemic threshold occurs at smaller @xmath0 for the unclustered network .",
    "to calculate the fraction of nodes in the giant component , it suffices to calculate the probability that a random node is _ not _ part of the giant component .",
    "these calculations have been done for cm networks by  @xcite .",
    "we follow the approach of  @xcite .",
    "a related approach is given by  @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath55 be the probability a random node @xmath3 is not part of the giant component .",
    "we have @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the probabilities that an independent edge or a triangle respectively does not connect to the giant component .",
    "to find @xmath57 , we note that there are two ways an edge can fail to connect @xmath3 to the giant component : it may be deleted in the percolation process with probability @xmath59 , or it may be kept , but @xmath18 , the node reached , is not part of the giant component .",
    "we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the probability that a node @xmath18 reached along an independent edge is not part of the giant component . to calculate @xmath61",
    "we note that @xmath18 is selected proportional to @xmath4 , but only has @xmath62 susceptible neighbors along independent edges .",
    "we get @xmath63 for @xmath58 we get @xmath64 ^ 2 - 2t^2(1-t)h_\\triangle(1 - h_\\triangle ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the probability a node reached along a triangle edge does not connect to the giant component through any edge not in the triangle .",
    "we find @xmath66    the resulting system of equations for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath61 , and @xmath65 can be solved iteratively , and the result gives @xmath55 .",
    "to find @xmath67 , the probability a random node in the unclustered network is not part of the giant component , we proceed similarly .",
    "we find @xmath68 it can be shown that @xmath69 for the equivalent degree distributions .",
    "consequently the size of the giant component is smaller in clustered networks than in unclustered networks of the same degree distribution and degree correlations .",
    "in figure  [ fig : comp ] we consider outbreak spread on three networks , all of which have the same degree distribution . we compare simulated epidemic sizes with predictions from the clustered equations , the unclustered , segregated equations , and the equations derived previously for configuration model networks  @xcite .",
    "+   +     the nodes are equally distributed between degrees @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in each network",
    "the clustering is distributed differently . in the first , @xmath73 ,  @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "that is those nodes with degree @xmath72 are only in triangles , nodes of degree @xmath71 have half of their edges in triangles and independent edges , and nodes of degree @xmath70 have just independent edges .",
    "high degree nodes tend to be clustered and contact other high degree nodes .",
    "the tendancy to contact other high degree nodes reduces the epidemic threshold , but the clustering raises the threshold .    in the second network , we take @xmath76 ,  @xmath77 , @xmath78 ,  @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "this yields identical distribution of neighbor degrees for nodes reached by either a triangle or an independent edge .",
    "the unclustered , segregated equations yield the same result as the configuration model equations .",
    "the clustered calculations have smaller epidemics .",
    "the third network is an inversion of the first .",
    "nodes with high degree have independent edges while nodes with low degree are clustered .",
    "we take @xmath81 ,  @xmath74 , and @xmath82 . again",
    "the assortativity reduces the epidemic threshold while clustering reduces the epidemic size . in this particular case , it is the preference for high degree nodes ( which are unclustered ) to contact one another that leads to the reduction in epidemic threshold , and so it is clear that the effect is due to assortative mixing , not clustering .",
    "we have introduced a new model of clustered networks on which we study percolation and epidemics .",
    "this model allows us to make a number of analytic prediction because the edges of the network can be partitioned into sets which are independent of one another ( independent edges or triangles ) .",
    "we have shown that these networks can have a lower epidemic threshold than configuration model networks with the same degree distribution .",
    "however , this is not a consequence of clustering , but rather a consequence of assortative mixing .",
    "the clustering of the network can be proven to raise the epidemic threshold and reduce the epidemic size from networks with the same degree correlations , but without clustering .",
