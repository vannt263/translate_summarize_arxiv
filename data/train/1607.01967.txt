    "many special functions satisfy differential equations @xmath0 whose coefficients  @xmath1 depend polynomially on the variable  @xmath2 . in virtually all cases ,",
    "such special functions can be defined by complementing  ( [ eq : deq ] ) either with simple initial values @xmath3 or with constraints on the asymptotic behavior of  @xmath4 as @xmath2  approaches a singular point .",
    "for example , the error function satisfies @xmath5 while the modified bessel function  @xmath6 is the solution of @xmath7 this observation has led to the idea of developing algorithms that deal with these functions in a uniform way , using the ode  ( [ eq : deq ] ) as a data structure  @xcite .    in this context ,",
    "solutions of linear odes with polynomial coefficients are called ( or ) functions .",
    "these names originate from combinatorics , where d - finite power series arise naturally as generating functions  @xcite .",
    "while classical special functions typically satisfy odes of order 2  to  4 with simple polynomial coefficients , d - finite generating functions are usually given by more general and sometimes very large equations .",
    "other notable sources of general d - finite functions include mathematical physics and number theory .",
    "explicit examples in theoretical works on meromorphic odes also tend to have polynomial coefficients .",
    "packages for manipulating d - finite power series symbolically exist for major computer algebra systems , and include in particular gfun  @xcite and the rest of the algolib bundle for maple , generatingfunctions  @xcite and the riscergosum suite for mathematica , and  @xcite for sagemath  @xcite .",
    "we extended with features dedicated to d - finite such as special functions , starting with numerical evaluation algorithms .",
    "the need for such features is most evident in the context of special functions , but they turn out to be useful in a wide range of applications , as we will see from the examples in the sequel .",
    "we refer to our implementation as , after the name of the subpackage of where most of the code resides .",
    "the present paper introduces the main features of , with example applications .",
    "the reader is invited to consult the package s documentation for more information .",
    "we further refer to hille  @xcite for more background on complex analytic odes , and to kauers  @xcite for an overview of the field of d - finite functions in computer algebra .",
    "also note that is intended to supersede numgfun  @xcite , a maple package with similar features previously developed by the author .",
    "since the main feature of is to compute numerical values of solutions of differential equations , it is , at its core , a numerical ode solver .",
    "however , it is limited to linear odes with polynomial coefficients , and differs from typical ode solvers in a number of other respects .",
    "first of all , the results it computes come with , making it a `` validated '' ode solver .",
    "it works in , and implements specific algorithms to make evaluations at very high precisions feasible .",
    "last but not least , it offers extensive support for connection problems between of differential operators .",
    "these distinctive features all rely on that make use of specific properties of d - finite functions .",
    "the development of is still very much a work in progress . at the time of writing",
    ", there is no formal release of containing the subpackage yet .",

    "in , differential operators are represented algebraically as . more specifically , the operators we are interested in are elements of the ring , denoted @xmath8 \\langle d_x \\rangle$ ] , of polynomials over @xmath8 $ ] for some number field @xmath9 in a variable  @xmath10 subject to the commutation rule @xmath11 ( which expresses the equality @xmath12 ) .",
    "elements of @xmath8 \\langle d_x \\rangle$ ] act on differentiable functions in a natural way , namely by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and can thus be identified with differential operators .    the first thing to do in order to use in a sage session is to install it in the python search path and it .",
    "the rings @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath8 \\langle d_x \\rangle$ ] and their respective generators @xmath2  and  @xmath10 can then be created using standard sage syntax as follows :    = .5ex = .5ex    note that supports general ore polynomials , but basic arithmetic with differential operators in one variable is all we are going to need here .",
    "after these commands , the python variable   contains an object of type `` ore polynomial '' that satisfies    = .5ex = .5ex    most features of , including those presented in this article , are available as methods of ore polynomial objects .",
    "some functions of the subpackage can also be called directly in advanced usage .",
    "let @xmath15 \\langle d_x \\rangle$ ] be a differential operator , and assume that the origin is an ordinary point of  @xmath16 , i.e.  that @xmath17 . by the classical cauchy existence theorem  @xcite",
    ", the equation @xmath18 then admits an @xmath19dimensional space of complex analytic solutions defined in a neighborhood of  @xmath20 and characterized by @xmath19  initial values at  @xmath20 .",
    "the method of differential operators computes values of d - finite functions defined in this way .",
    "perhaps the simplest example is the computation of @xmath21 as the value at  @xmath22 of the solution of @xmath23 such that @xmath24 :    = .5ex = .5ex    the last argument , , provides an indication of the accuracy the user is interested in .",
    "the method outputs a `` mid - rad interval '' , or , consisting of a multiple - precision center and a low - precision radius . in normal circumstances",
    ", the diameter of this ball will be of the order of magnitude of , but this is not guaranteed to be the case .",
    "in contrast , barring any bug , the mathematical result is guaranteed to lie within the bounds of the ball .",
    "evaluations on the complex plane are also supported .",
    "based on  ( [ eq : erf ] ) , we may for instance evaluate the error function as follows :    = .5ex = .5ex    allowed evaluation points and initial values include rational and floating - point numbers , algebraic numbers , and constant symbolic expressions .",
    "the reader may have noticed that the argument used to specify the evaluation point is called .",
    "the main reason why does not simply take an evaluation is that in general , solutions of differential equations with singular points are not single - valued analytic functions . what really computes is the analytic continuation along of the solution of defined in the neighborhood of the starting point by the initial conditions .",
    "consider for example the operator @xmath25 , obtained by differentiating the inhomogeneous equation @xmath26 .",
    "a basis of solutions of  @xmath16 is @xmath27 , corresponding respectively to the initial values @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "analytic continuation of the latter to  @xmath30 along a path that passes above the singular point @xmath31 corresponds to the standard determination of the complex logarithm , while a path that passes below the origin yields another branch :    = .5ex = .5ex    more generally , it is possible to compute the matrix that maps a vector @xmath32 \\label{eq : ini}\\ ] ] of initial conditions at  @xmath33 to the vector @xmath34 $ ] of `` initial '' conditions at some other point  @xmath35 that define the analytic continuation of the same solution  @xmath36 along a given path . following van der hoeven  @xcite , we call this matrix the along that path .",
    "= .5ex = .5ex    transition matrices along loops that turn around a singular point exactly once are called monodromy matrices .",
    "the first step of van  enckevort and van  straten s experimental study of differential equations of calabi - yau type  @xcite consists in computing high - precision approximations of all monodromy matrices starting from a common base point .",
    "the method makes this computation straightforward . in the case of the singularity at  @xmath22 of the operator studied in example  1 from their article ,",
    "we obtain :    = .5ex = .5ex    the analytic continuation algorithm behind these functions is based on work by chudnovsky and chudnovsky  @xcite with some later improvements @xcite . in the language of numerical methods for odes , it is a high - order taylor series method with a step size of the order of the local radius of convergence of solutions .",
    "the computation of the transition matrix for each step boils down to that of sums of power series whose coefficients are generated by linear recurrence relations .",
    "two algorithms for this task are currently implemented : a nave iterative summation and a simple binary splitting method . in both cases ,",
    "the entries of a given column are actually computed all at once , by working with truncated power series in a manner similar to direct - mode automatic differentiation .",
    "once the terms of the sum have decreased below the target accuracy , the algorithm of  @xcite is used to get a rigorous bound on the tail of the series .",
    "both the computation of the numerical result and that of error bounds rely on arb  @xcite for controlling the round - off errors in basic arithmetic operations .",
    "singular connection problems are similar to the analytic continuation problems of the previous section , except that one or both ends of the analytic continuation path are singular points of the operator ( points where the leading coefficient vanishes ) . at a singular point ,",
    "the cauchy theorem does not apply , and solutions of the operator may diverge or display a branch point .",
    "our implementation supports the situation where the singularities involved are .",
    "a singular point  @xmath33 of @xmath37 \\langle d_x \\rangle$ ] is regular when @xmath16  admits a full basis of solutions each of the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 are analytic functions and @xmath40 is an algebraic number .",
    "a basic example is that of the modified bessel equation  ( [ eq : bessel ] ) , which possesses a regular singular point at  @xmath31 and whose standard solutions are defined by their asymptotic behavior there .",
    "starting from  ( [ eq : bessel ] ) , we can compute @xmath41 by :      this command is to be understood as follows .",
    "it is classical that , when  @xmath33 is a regular singular point of  @xmath16 , a solution of  @xmath16 is characterized by the coefficients of the monomials @xmath42 in its expansion  ( [ eq : regsingexp ] ) about  @xmath33 , where @xmath43  ranges over the roots of the so - called indicial polynomial of  @xmath16 at  @xmath33 and @xmath44  is less than the multiplicity of the root  @xmath43 .",
    "the initial conditions accepted by in this case are the coefficients of these monomials ( ordered in a certain way , basically by asymptotic dominance as @xmath45 ) .",
    "this definition generalizes the convention  ( [ eq : ini ] ) used at ordinary points .",
    "we call the corresponding basis of solutions the at  @xmath33 .",
    "a convenience method provides the distinguished monomials .",
    "koutschan then evaluates  @xmath51 in order to obtain the return probability of the lattice .",
    "both @xmath31 and @xmath52 are regular singular points of the operator .",
    "let us examine the possible behaviors of solutions at these two points :      as it turns out , the space of analytic solutions at the origin has dimension  1 , and all other solutions involve logarithms .",
    "it is easy to see from the definition of  @xmath53 that @xmath54 , so that the function we are interested in is exactly the last element of the local canonical basis . at @xmath52",
    ", there is a three - dimensional subspace of solutions that tend to zero , spanned by the last three basis elements , while the first basis function has a finite limit .",
    "thus the value of  @xmath53 there is the upper right entry of the transition matrix from @xmath20  to  @xmath22 , namely :              this implies that the radius of convergence of @xmath61 is in @xmath62 , so that @xmath63 must be of one of the forms @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 as @xmath67 .",
    "the same holds for  @xmath68 .",
    "a key step of apry s proof is to show that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but @xmath71 .",
    "analytic solutions at @xmath31 are determined by the first two coefficients of their taylor expansions . at @xmath72 ,",
    "the canonical local basis takes the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 are analytic and @xmath75 .                    in the same way , using the initial terms @xmath83 , @xmath84 of @xmath85 , we can compute the coefficient of  @xmath86 in the decomposition of @xmath87 and check that the ratio of the two values we obtained is  @xmath55 .",
