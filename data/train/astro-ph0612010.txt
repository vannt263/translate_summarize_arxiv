    "at present information on the characteristics of hadronic interactions in fragmentation region is still scarce or missing and experiments with ` roman pots ' are anticipated to improve the situation .",
    "some of this information , in principle , could be obtained with the use of the data on cr muon and hadron spectra , provided pcr spectra are known with high precision , but that is not the case .",
    "the obvious obstacle here is that at high energies pcr fluxes themselves are functionals of various interaction parameters plus their accuracy is appreciably affected by additional systematic effects .",
    "however , comparison of the hadron and muon fluxes , predicted by different interaction packages with the experimental data still allows to get information on the fragmentation particle spectra in the quasi - independent on the pcr fluxes data way .",
    "besides , as shown below in this paper , our notions on behavior of the pcr light nuclei spectra can also benefit from such analysis .",

    "all interaction codes , except qgsjet  01 , satisfactory describe data on muon flux only up to @xmath33100  gev and then one by one fail to do it .",
    "accounting that such muon energies correspond to primary energies above 1  tev , studied with balloon(satellite)-borne emulsion chambers , one should simply relate muon deficit to underestimation of primary light nuclei fluxes , taking place in these experiments  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , disagreement between the models in the muon fluxes also appears at energies around 100  gev , thus making impossible precise reconstruction of primary nucleon spectrum for @xmath34  tev .",
    "in fact , in such conditions there are no reasons to rule out any of the models , except qgsjet  01 , which , as it was said above , leads to remarkable disagreement with the experiment even in the range of reliable magnetic spectrometers data on pcr and muon spectra .    to find why the models differ in the predicted muon fluxes let us consider quite characteristic energy of 1.29  tev , where discrepancies between the models reach appreciable values and the data on muons from underground installations are yet quite reliable .",
    "contributions of primary protons to the differential flux of muons of the given energy , presented in figure  2 show , that spread in muon fluxes between the interaction models is entirely due to uncertainties in the description of @xmath35-spectra in fragmentation region @xmath36 ( see figure  3 ) . since inclusive muon flux is sensitive nearly only to the characteristics of the very first primary particle interaction , hence , the harder these spectra are in the particular model , the larger muon intensity its use leads to . for the lower values of @xmath37 ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath38  tev , all the models give practically the same muon yields .",
    "as noted above , in view of uncertain situation with primary spectra for @xmath34  tev , one can not give preference to any of the models in comparison with the others .",
    "if to demand the minimal disagreement with the direct measurements data on pcr spectra , then obviously sibyll  2.1 satisfies this requirement the best , or , in other words , one may say that it provides the most acceptable description of @xmath35 production spectra in @xmath39-air collisions in fragmentation region .",

    "below 100  gev all the calculated spectra have breaks , because of non - perfect matching of low - energy model gheisha to the high - energy models .",
    "shape of the measured hadron spectra also breaks at energies above 4  tev and the data become less definite , thus in the forthcoming analysis we are going to use data only for energies from 129  gev to 4  tev . for these energies",
    "qgsjet  01 , qgsjet  ii and sibyll  2.1 quite reasonably reproduce the shape of the measured hadron spectrum , nexus  3.97 leads to spectrum with almost constant power index .",
    "one can see , that the most consistent description of the data for specified energies provide qgsjet  01 and sibyll  2.1 .",
    "in contrast with the muons there are no energy range , where the models agree on the hadron fluxes and the reasons of this disagreement are not as simply to point out as in the case with muons .",
    "the most important characteristics in this analysis are total inelastic cross section , determining chances of primary particle to survive , shapes of inclusive spectra @xmath50 , @xmath49 , @xmath45 in the very forward region , responsible for substantial process of leading particles production ( see figure  5 for the listed spectra ) .",
    "let us briefly outline the major conclusions , which one may come to in the given situation .",
    "nexus  3.97 gives the lowest fluxes as of hadrons in total , so of nucleons and mesons , and this happens in spite of the lowest inelastic cross - section values .",
    "inclusive spectrum @xmath50 immediately helps to figure out , that incident protons in nexus  3.97 have comparably low chances to save most of their energy in collision and this leads to such low nucleon flux , the same may be said about meson flux and production of pions by pions .",
    "similarly , from comparison of the inclusive spectra , it can be easily understood , why qgsjet  ii gives the highest hadron flux .",
    "note , that sibyll  2.1 concedes to qgsjet  ii in hadron intensity mostly because of less effective production of leading neutrons in @xmath39-air collisions and due to the larger total interaction cross - section .",
    "thus , from analysis of the data on hadron flux it is difficult to imply any strict constraints on inclusive spectra shapes , since mechanism of hadron spectrum formation is more sophisticated than that in the case of muon spectrum .",
    "sibyll  2.1 and qgsjet  01 display quite a different behaviours of the relevant inclusive spectra and total interaction cross - sections , but both models almost equally succeed in description of the eas - top data .",
    "alas , even this conclusion must be taken with care , since it is based on the single set of data and we have only indirect indications on the accuracy of this set , e.g. such as agreement of primary proton fluxes , obtained by eas - top and kascade teams ( the latter is derived from flux of unaccompanied hadrons  @xcite ) .",
    "self - consistency implies , that pcr mass composition and spectra , once been retrieved from one kind of eas data with particular interaction model , shall bring to satisfactory description of all other types of eas data with the use of this very model . in our case",
    "this means , that one can reconstruct flux of primary protons , for example , from the data on hadron flux and then to apply it as input to get flux of muons . as we have seen , to match the data on muons with all the models the primary nucleon flux for @xmath34  tev",
    "must be increased in comparison with the direct measurements data .",
    "but , on the contrary , to describe eas - top hadron flux with qgsjet  ii pcr flux must be significantly decreased , to less extent this applies also to sibyll  2.1 . in the case of qgsjet  ii this change would result in very large disagreement with the data on muons .",
    "since there are almost no need in correction of pcr spectra fits  @xcite for qgsjet  01 to agree with the data on hadron flux , this model also fails to satisfy self - consistency conditions .",
    "the only model , that simultaneously understates fluxes of hadrons and muons is nexus  3.97 .",
    "but , even leaving aside misfit of the hadron spectrum shape , any changes in primary nucleon intensity for @xmath51  gev / n , needed to minimize discrepancy with the eas - top data , will immediately lead to disagreement with the data on muon fluxes for energies well below 100  gev .",
    "hence , one may conclude , that sibyll  2.1 gives the most acceptable overall description of the muon and hadron fluxes .",
    "some underestimation of the muon flux for @xmath52  gev almost for sure should be related to the underestimation of primary nucleon flux for @xmath34  tev .",
    "overstatement of the hadron flux , which will be emphasized by this correction , may be compensated via slight reduction of diffractive events fraction . + authors greatly acknowledge conex team and personally tanguy pierog for their kind permission to use conex cross - section tables and for technical support ."
