    "these include specialised variational formulations such as those studied at length in @xcite as well as general methods such as those proposed in @xcite .    a natural approach to deal with spectral pollution ,",
    "is to derive conditions on the approximating subspaces guaranteeing a `` safe '' galerkin method in a given interval of the real line .",
    "these conditions were found in @xcite on an abstract setting for operators with particular block - type structures with respect to decompositions of the ambient hilbert space .",
    "they turn out to be motivated from techniques in numerical analysis @xcite and computational physics and chemistry ( see references in @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we adopt a more general viewpoint than that of @xcite .",
    "we establish an abstract framework for spectral pollution in the galerkin method and then examine its invariance under relatively compact perturbations .",
    "our main concern is primarily theoretical and general in nature .",
    "nonetheless , however , we include various simple examples which illustrate the many subtleties faced when dealing with spectral pollution on a practical setting .",
    "the technical context of our results can be summarised as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 be the domain of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath10 be a sequence of finite dimensional subspaces of @xmath9 , dense in the graph norm as @xmath11 ( definition  [ def : a - regular ] ) lie in the domain of the quadratic form associated to @xmath0 and that the sequence @xmath12 is dense in the form sense .",

    "denote by @xmath15 the large @xmath16 limiting set in hausdorff distance of the galerkin method spectra @xmath17 , ( definition  [ rel_spec ] ) .",
    "then @xmath18 ( proposition  [ prop_2 ] ) , however in general equality fails to occur in this identity .",
    "an abstract notion of _ limiting spectral pollution set _ can be formulated naturally as , @xmath19 as it turns , points in the limiting spectral pollution set behave in a similar fashion as points in the essential spectrum ( proposition  [ prop : properties_of_rel_spec ] ) .",
    "therefore a question arises : what sort of conditions on a perturbation @xmath1 ensure @xmath20 ?",
    "below we establish a theoretical framework in order to address this question .    section  [ sec1 ] and [ sec2 ] are devoted to a characterisation of @xmath15 in terms of special weyl - type sequences ( @xmath21-weyl sequences ) and its structural properties . in definition  [ rel_ess_spec ]",
    "we consider a decomposition of @xmath15 as the union of a _ limiting essential spectrum _ associated with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and its _ limiting discrete spectrum _",
    "counterpart , @xmath23 .",
    "the former contains both the true essential spectrum @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( proposition [ prop : quasi_weyl ] ) .",
    "the purpose of sections  [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] is to find conditions on @xmath1 ensuring @xmath26 according to our main result ( theorem  [ thm : weyl ] ) , when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are bounded from below and @xmath27 is a compact operator for some @xmath28 negative enough , holds true .",
    "therefore , an approximating sequence @xmath21 will not asymptotically pollute for @xmath0 in a given interval if and only if it does not pollute for @xmath1 in the same interval .",
    "this generalises ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary  2.5 ) .",
    "our present approach consists in adapting to the context of limiting spectra , several classical results for the spectrum and essential spectrum . in turns , this leads to many unexpected difficulties which we will illustrate on a variety of simple examples . in particular , we establish ( theorem [ thm : mapping ] ) a limiting spectra version of the spectral mapping theorem allowing to replace the unbounded operator @xmath0 by its ( bounded ) resolvent @xmath29 .",
    "remarkably , this theorem fails in general ( remark  [ remark5 ] ) for operators which are not semi - bounded .",
