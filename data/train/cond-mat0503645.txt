    "melting is a dramatic phase transition where the translation symmetry present in the solid phase is destroyed at the transition point . as a paradigm of a phase transition in condensed matter physics , its microscopic mechanism has been studied from the beginning of the solid state theory  @xcite .",
    "early theories relate melting with an intrinsic elastic instability of the crystal . according to a stability criteria established by born  @xcite",
    ", melting takes place when an elastic shear modulus vanishes and the crystal looses its ability to resist shear .",
    "this was interpreted as due to the softening of a transverse phonon mode with , as a consequence , the homogeneous breakdown of the crystalline order .",
    "this notion of crystalline instability refers only to the properties of the crystalline phase but a complete theory of melting should also refer to the properties of the liquid phase .",
    "therefore , modern theories invoke thermal excitation of extended defects such as dislocation lines  @xcite .",
    "pairs of dislocations can be thermally excited at temperatures within the range of typical solid phases .",
    "the presence of dislocations lowers the cost in energy to create an additional dislocation ; if the energy reduction is strong enough , it could lead to an avalanche of dislocations resulting in a first order phase transition .",
    "so far , two different ways of melting has been recognized in the literature @xcite .",
    "one related to the thermodynamical melting starting at the surface or extrinsic inhomogeneities of the samples , and the other one with regards to the limit of the mechanical stability of the crystal which takes place when surface is avoided and the solid could be overheated above the equilibrium melting point .",
    "overheating has been experimentally achieved by coating a solid with another material of higher melting point  @xcite .",
    "as no extrinsic inhomogeneities are present , thermal excitations of defects play an essential role to initiate the melting process . in this work",
    ", we will focus on this type of melting .",
    "although experimental analysis of the microscopic dynamics near melting is very difficult , numerical simulations have recently shown that correlated clusters of defects thermally excited play a central role in this process at the limit of overheating  @xcite .",
    "moreover in a previous work we have related clusters of defects to dislocation lines assumed in phenomenological theories  @xcite . however , the situation is far from being solved and continues to puzzle condensed - matter theorists .",
    "an alternative strategy to look for the melting origin could be to change an external parameter and to follow how this parameter affects the melting .",
    "the obvious choice of this parameter is the external pressure acting on the solid .",
    "moreover , the pressure dependence of the melting temperature has a practical interest _",
    "per se _ and the determination of high pressure melting curves is a subject of many investigations  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss the effect of pressure on the melting properties of a surface free crystal by means of a computationally intensive monte carlo ( mc ) calculation using a constant pressure algorithm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze some thermodynamic properties at overheating limit . in sec .",
    "iii we look at the defect structure preceding the overheating limit .",
    "section iv contains our conclusions and discussion .",
    "our simulations have been performed on a cubic box of 2048 particles  @xcite interacting via a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential written as @xmath2 $ ] . to guarantee that the potential goes smoothly to zero at distance greater than the cutoff ( @xmath3 ) , a cutoff region from @xmath4 to @xmath3 was used following previous work @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can compare our results for the properties at the overheating limit with ones previously obtained at the equilibrium melting point .",
    "moreover we fix the cutoff @xmath5 which has been shown to be greater enough to assure convergence of the results@xcite .",
    "the energies are measured in units of @xmath6 , the distances in units of @xmath7 and the pressure in unit of @xmath8 .",
    "the temperature is reported in units of @xmath9 . as a concrete example we can take the parameters for argon ( @xmath10 ) where our units are : @xmath11 for the distances , @xmath12 for the temperatures and @xmath13 for the pressures .",
    "our units of pressure differ by a factor @xmath14 from those used in previous works@xcite . moreover ,",
    "our unit of volume differ by a factor @xmath15 .",
    "we emphasized that the use of periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) suppresses surface effects and the phase transition temperature we find does not correspond to the thermodynamical melting point but to the limit of overheating of the crystal  @xcite .",
    "let us discuss how we constructed the phase diagram of the system .",
    "for a fixed pressure at a given temperature , we have averaged the internal energy and the volume over the mc runs .",
    "both the particle coordinates and the volume of the cell are updated in each mc step  @xcite .",
    "heating is done in a step - by - step procedure starting at low temperature with the particles at the sites of a fcc perfect lattice .",
    "the calculation of the jump for different properties ( volume , energy , etc . ) at the limit of overheating is a difficult task in mc simulation , because of the long cpu time necessary to achieve equilibrium values in this intermediate region .",
    "we have densely partitioned the temperature interval and run @xmath16 mc steps in this zone . in fig .",
    "[ p1000](a ) we show a typical results of the evolution of the energy and the atomic volume ( @xmath17 ) for @xmath18 with the temperature .",
    "the abrupt jump is related to the limit of overheating .",
    "we have observed that both the snapshot of the particle positions as well as the radial distribution function ( rdf ) above this jump do not show any indication of the crystalline order . by locating the temperature where this jump takes place at different pressures we construct the figure  [ p1000](b ) where we show the overheating limit(@xmath0 ) as a function of pressure . for comparison",
    ", we have included the results for the equilibrium melting point(@xmath19 ) extracted from table ii of ref .",
    ", obtained by using molecular dynamics ( md ) coexistence simulations .",
    "we take from this work the results obtained using the same smooth cutoff @xmath5 as in our mc simulation .",
    "the two set of values could be fit following the corresponding next laws : @xmath20 @xmath21 note in figure  [ p1000](b ) that even at @xmath22 , the overheating phenomena is observed . while the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 increase with pressure , the exponent of the pressure is quite similar ,",
    "@xmath23 . in the same figure",
    "we have added @xmath19 datas ( start symbols ) from ref . , where the gibbs - duhem integration molecular simulation thechnique was used .",
    "we can see the agreement with the extrapolation of eq .",
    "( [ fittm ] ) even in the high pressure regime@xcite .",
    "let us analyze this exponent at the light of previous results valid in the regime of high pressure@xcite .",
    "when particle are close enough , the repulsive part of the potential @xmath24 dominates and a power law has been deduced ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "all this , indicate that the low pressure zone could be neglected in the scale we are presenting the phase diagram .    a microscopic understanding of the differents multiplicative constant shown in the eq . ( [ fittm ] ) and eq . ( [ fittoh ] ) could be explained with the following argument . while no extrinsic nucleation center as surface or defects are present in our simulation system , in order to break the crystalline order thermal activation of clusters of defects are necessary ( see next section ) . however , as pressure increase , more thermal energy is needed because particles are strongly compacted .",
    "this is different than the process involved in the thermodynamical melting where a liquid phase starts at the surface and pressure is less effective to increase the transition temperature .",

    "the three curves intersect at a pressure which separates two regimes . at this pressure , @xmath45",
    ", @xmath36 is approximately the value where a perfect fcc lattice is in equilibrium under the action of the interacting forces .",
    "therefore the system is dilated at melting for @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    ", it is compressed .",
    "note that the stability criteria given by eq.([gp ] ) gives an overall correct estimation for the overheating volume .",
    "the fact that the vanishing of @xmath38 shear module gives a good estimation for the superheating volume when solid expands has been recognized in previous works  @xcite .",
    "note however that in a recent study of amorphization under decompression it has been shown that the condition @xmath48 and the softening of a shear phonon signal the critical pressure which destroys the crystalline order  @xcite , only at @xmath34 .",
    "note in addition , that @xmath39 is smaller ( greater ) than @xmath36 for the dilated ( compressed ) system .",
    "this is consistent with the overheating phenomena found for all pressure .",
    "looking at the inset it is easy to note two different behaviors around the equilibrium volume ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "for volumes bellow the @xmath49 the thermal energies necessary to destroy a crystal are lower in the overheating case .",
    "and in contrary , for volumes above @xmath49 the thermal energies are lower in the melting case ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ phdiag ] ) .",
    "the crossover from dilation to compression is also seen in the percentage jump of the atomic volume at the melting @xmath50(@xmath51 is the difference between the liquid and solid volumes per particle ) . in fig .",
    "[ phdiag](b ) we show this value obtained from mc simulation .",
    "we can see that for @xmath52 , @xmath53 is reduced and becomes almost pressure independent .",
    "this behavior could be understood from the relation valid in the high pressure regime . from eq . (",
    "18 ) of ref .",
    "we see that the specific volume of the solid ( @xmath54 ) and the liquid ( @xmath55 ) scale with the same exponent of the temperature : @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the relative jump of the volume is : @xmath60 which is @xmath26 and @xmath37 independent and of the order of magnitude of the value found in the mc simulation at high pressure as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ phdiag ] ( b )    microscopically , the structure of the solid near the overheating limit is not the same above and below @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the jump percentage of @xmath17 becomes very small above @xmath61 signalling that the structure of the solid below @xmath0 has a lot of defects and could be easily destroyed .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section where the evolution of the defect structure will be analyzed .",
    "we now look at the two term of the claussius - clapeyron equation obtained from our numerical results .",
    "note that the validity of this equation is not guaranteed a priori because we are calculating the properties at the overheating limit where the free energy of the liquid and solid phase are not equal .",
    "it is an interesting point to analyze how different are the properties at @xmath0 from the ones predicted assuming coexistence between the two phases .",
    "we have calculated the latent heat of the transition defined as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the jump of the internal energy . in fig .",

    "squares correspond to @xmath66 where the latent heat @xmath67 is obtained from the jumps of the internal energy and the volume ( @xmath51).,width=302 ]",
    "we have recently found  @xcite a premelting temperature at @xmath22 where the number of thermally activated defects increases dramatically and defects start to group in clusters . near @xmath0 only one cluster across the whole system survives , breaking the crystalline order . in this work",
    "we analyze how this feature evolves with the external pressure .",
    "we define a defect as a particle with coordination number ( cn ) different from @xmath68 , which is the number of nearest neighbors ( nn ) in an ideal fcc lattice .",
    "this cn , called @xmath69 , is obtained by counting the number of particles around a given particle up to a cutoff radius .",
    "this cutoff is chosen for each pressure as the value where the radial distribution function has its first minimum at low temperature , i.e. the value of the distance between the maxima of the first and the second neighbors .",
    "to compare our results for different pressures we normalize the temperature scale to the value of @xmath0 corresponding to each pressure ( @xmath70 ) . in fig .",
    "[ cnvst ] we show the coordination number mean value and the percentage of defects as a function of @xmath71 for different pressures .",
    "we see that the reduced temperature where a great number of defects are activated and the crystalline order is perturbed , decreases by increasing pressure .",
    "for example for @xmath22 we should go up to @xmath72 of @xmath0 to have @xmath73 of defects whereas at @xmath47 we achieved the same quantity of defects by going only up to @xmath74 of @xmath0 .",
    "the decrease of the coordination number shows a similar behavior .",
    "these facts are consistent with the small jump of the volume between the two phases found in the previous section .",
    "moreover , it is seen in fig .",
    "[ cnvst ] that going beyond the crossover pressure @xmath61 the curves almost coincide .",
    "when the repulsive part of the potential dominates the system could be connected with a hard sphere model with a temperature dependent radius @xcite .",

    "the percentage of defects ( left scale ) and the mean coordination number ( right scale ) as functions of the reduced temperature for different pressures.,width=302 ]    like we stated in the introduction , modern theories associate the melting process with a proliferation of dislocation lines .",
    "this means that defects would have to be correlated near the melting point . to analyze this correlation",
    ", we have grouped the defects into clusters by the following methodology .",
    "we start from a given defect and search for new defects up to the cutoff distance . for each of these new defects ,",
    "we undertake the same procedure .",
    "we iterate this process up to completion of a cluster of connected defects .",
    "then we take a new defect disconnected to all the previous ones and develop the same procedure . at the end of this process",
    "we separate our set of defects in @xmath75 clusters which are disconnected between them .",
    "the defects within a cluster are neighbors to each other but they are not connected to the defects of another cluster .    in fig .",
    "[ nclvst ] we show the mean value of @xmath75 as a function of @xmath71 .",
    "the decrease of this quantity above a given @xmath71 ( called @xmath76 ) should be compared with the increase of the number of defective particles shown in fig .",
    "[ cnvst ] .",
    "these facts indicate that the clusters are becoming bigger and that the defects correlate among them for @xmath77",
    ". @xmath76 decreases with increasing pressure and becomes constant at high enough pressures .",
    "the premelting zone increases as we already emphasized previously .",
    "this could be important to detect experimentally excitations of dislocations lines in the study of melting of materials under pressure .     the average number of clusters as a function of @xmath71 for different pressures.,width=302 ]    for low pressures we see that the curves move away from the @xmath22 curves and for high pressures they notably coincide with each other .",
    "all of these seem to point out that the same mechanism makes the crystal melt at these values of pressure .",
    "note that in a phenomenological theory the crystal melts at a fixed density of dislocation lines at different pressures  @xcite . at this stage",
    ", we can not give a definitive statement on this prediction but it is suggestive that the tails of all the curves of fig .  [ cnvst ] correspond to only one cluster .",
    "this means that all the defects of the system are interconnected to each other .    finally , let us notice that fig .",
    "[ cnvst ] and fig .",
    "[ nclvst ] show not only the same mechanism of melting at different pressures but also the same structure of thermal excited defects at these pressures .",
