    "the most recent catalogue by dias et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) presents data on 1537 galactic open clusters .",
    "these are excellent objects with which to probe the structure and evolution of the galactic disc .",
    "since old and intermediate - age open clusters cover the entire lifetime of the disc , they allow us to trace the history of chemical enrichment and the formation of the different galactic populations .",
    "for example , salaris , weiss & percival ( 2004 ) determined the ages of 71 old open clusters and concluded that the thin and thick disc started to form at the same time .",
    "carraro et al .",
    "( 2004 ) observed open clusters from the outskirts of the disc and suggested that the outer part of the galactic disc underwent a completely different evolution compared to the inner disc .",
    "based on a sample of 39 open clusters , friel et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) noted a slight correlation between metallicity and age for clusters in the outer disc beyond 10 kpc .",
    "recently , intermediate - age open clusters were also found towards the galactic centre direction ( carraro , mndez & costa 2005 ) , where star clusters do not survive for enough time due to the higher - density environment .",
    "the observations of the clusters presented in this paper were conducted as a part of a photometric survey of a large sample of distant open clusters .",
    "the goal of the project was an identification of the oldest open clusters in order to obtain a lower limit on the age of the galactic disc ( kaluzny & rucinski 1995 , see also references therein ) . in this paper",
    ", we present for ccd photometry of three faint open clusters : ngc 2425 , haffner  10 and czernik  29 .",
    "the equatorial and galactic coordinates of the cluster centres are listed in table  1 .",
    ".equatorial and galactic coordinates of target clusters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have presented @xmath0 photometry for three poorly studied open clusters from the southern hemisphere . for each cluster we calculated surface density profile and established the probable number of cluster members .",
    "the analysis of the derived colour - magnitude diagrams allowed us to estimate basic parameters like the age and distance .",
    "the results are summarized in table 4 .",
    "we found that the clusters ngc 2425 and haffner  10 , are intermediate - age open clusters . probably due to the relatively large number of star members ,",
    "the clusters still constitute physical systems .",
    "we notice that the age as well as the heliocentric distance estimations of the two clusters are very similar , though the extinctions are quite different .",
    "interestingly , the angular separation between the clusters is only @xmath7 , which gives an approximate linear seperation of 150  pc , assuming an average distance of 3.65  kpc .",
    "this is about 50 and 100 times larger than the cluster core radius of ngc 2425 and haffner  10 , respectively .",
    "we should note that the seperation is larger than for other double systems of clusters presented in the literature ( subramaniam et  al .",
    "1995 , pietrzyski & udalski 2000 ) .",
    "however , there is a possibility that the two clusters constituted a pair of open clusters in the past .",
    "based on the comparison of the cmds with the theoretical isochrones we were not able to firmly establish the metallicity of either of the clusters .",
    "we may only suggest that the metal abundance is comparable for both clusters , which may indicate a common origin . a spectroscopic determination of the metallicity and radial velocities would help to verify this hypothesis .",
    "we would like to thank greg stachowski for remarks on the draft version of this paper .",
