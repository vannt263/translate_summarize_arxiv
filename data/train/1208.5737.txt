    "cogent ( coherent germanium neutrino technology ) is a program aiming to exploit the characteristics of p - type point - contact germanium detectors in areas as diverse as the search for low - mass dark matter candidates , coherent neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering , and @xmath2ge double - beta decay @xcite .",
    "data collected from a first cogent detector at a shallow underground location demonstrated sensitivity to low - mass ( @xmath3  gev / c@xmath1 ) dark matter particles @xcite .",
    "in particular , it appeared cogent was particularly well suited to address the dama / libra @xcite modulation result . following the identification of several sources of internal background in this prototype ,",
    "a second cogent detector was installed in the soudan underground laboratory ( sul ) during 2009 with the goal of improving upon the dark matter sensitivity reach of the 2008 result @xcite .",
    "the first 56-days of operation of the cogent detector at sul showed an unexpected excess of events @xcite above the anticipated backgrounds for ionization energies below 2  kev .",
    "further data collection from this detector continued until an interruption imposed by a fire in the access shaft to the laboratory halted the initial run in march of 2011 .",
    "analysis of the accumulated data set @xcite , spanning 442 live days over the period 4 december 2009 to 6 march 2011 , showed a @xmath4 significance modulation of the monthly event rate in the low - energy region that is compatible with the dark matter signature described in @xcite .",
    "the fitting procedure generating this low - significance modulation result used unconstrained phase , period , and amplitude variables .",
    "time - stamped data have been made publicly available , allowing for a number of independent analyses and interpretations .    in this paper",
    "we provide a more in - depth description of the apparatus and data analysis , concentrating on aspects of instrument stability , data cuts , uncertainties , and background estimation .",
    "the data set employed for this discussion is the same as in @xcite , and all energies are in kevee ( kev electron equivalent , i.e. , ionization energy ) , unless otherwise stated . following the three - month outage resulting from the soudan fire , this detector has taken data continuously , starting 7 june 2011 .",
    "an additional body of data is to be released in the near future . the design and expectations for cogent-4 ( c-4 ) , a planned expansion aiming at an increase in active mass by a factor of ten , featuring four large ppc detectors with a reduced energy threshold and lower background , are discussed in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "the present cogent detector is located at the soudan underground laboratory ( soudan , minnesota , usa ) at a vertical depth of 2341  feet ( 689  feet below sea level ) , providing 2090  meters of water equivalent ( m.w.e . ) overburden as shielding against cosmic rays and associated backgrounds .",
    "the detector shield is placed on a floor built on top of base i - beams that once supported the soudan-2 proton decay experiment @xcite .",
    "the detector element is a single modified bege germanium diode .",
    "bege ( broad energy germanium ) is the commercial denomination used by the manufacturer ( canberra industries ) for their line of ppc detectors .",
    "the technical characteristics of this ppc are shown in table [ tab : begecharacteristics ] .",
    "the detector is contained within an ofhc copper end cap cryostat , and mounted in an ofhc copper inner can connected to an ofhc copper cold finger .",
    "internal detector parts were custom manufactured in either ofhc copper or ptfe .",
    "all internal parts were etched to remove surface contaminations using ultra - pure acids in class 100 clean room conditions , following procedures similar to those described in @xcite .",
    "a commercial stainless steel horizontal cryostat encloses the rear of the assembly , providing electrical feed - through to a side - mounted canberra dprp pulse - reset preamplifier typically used in high - resolution x - ray detectors ( figure [ fig : begeinnershield ] ) .",
    ".[tab : begecharacteristics ] characteristics of the cogent high purity ppc germanium detector at sul . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      similar to figure [ fig : muoninduced ] , with expanded ranges : energy spectrum of the simulated @xmath5u , @xmath6th , and @xmath7k resistor background ( dotted line ) compared to cogent data ( solid ) . in the energy range",
    "displayed the estimated resistor backgrounds are by far dominant .",
    "the resistor background spectrum is for metal film resistors , the same used in the cogent front end .",
    "also shown are other background contributions and their sum .",
    "contributions from @xmath8pb bremsstrahlung and radioactivity in ptfe and ofhc cryostat parts are comparatively negligible . ]    as a further consistency check we examined the existing cogent data out to an energy of 300  kevee .",
    "the statistics in this range are limited ( 5 days of dedicated exposure , see sec.iii-a ) .",
    "figure [ fig : data300gammas ] shows possible 238  kev @xmath9pb ( @xmath6th chain ) and 295  kev ( @xmath5u chain ) gamma lines . due to their relatively - low energy ,",
    "their source would be near the crystal , within the inner lead cavity .",
    "if they are considered as a measure of the @xmath5u and @xmath6th chain contamination in front - end resistors , a 14@xmath107  bq / kg for @xmath5u contamination and 1.6@xmath100.7 bq / kg for @xmath6th contamination is obtained for the resistors .",
    "this activity would provide @xmath11937 events in the 0.5 - 3.0  kevee region , in good agreement with the measured flat component of the spectrum .",
    "the statistical evidence for these lines is however slim , and their presence is seen to be mutually exclusive when examining the uncertainties associated to the energy scale extrapolation used for this short run .     existing cogent data in the range up to 300 kev , with possible weak @xmath9pb ( 238 kev ) and @xmath12pb ( 295 kev ) gamma lines indicated by arrows .",
    "the extrapolated energy scale can only be considered approximate .",
    "the energy binning corresponds to the approximate fwhm resolution for these two lines .",
    "see text for a discussion on a possible origin for these putative lines in the front - end resistors .",
    "notoriously absent are a @xmath8pb peak at 46.5 kev and excess lead x - rays , a result of the radiopurity of the inner lead layers in the shield ( sec.ii-a ) and detector surfaces ( sec.v - c ) . ]",
    "while the smallness of neutrino cross - sections indicate that their contribution to the cogent spectrum should be negligible , the signal from coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering @xcite from several sources ( e.g. solar , atmospheric , diffuse supernova , and geo - neutrinos ) would be highly concentrated at low energies .",
    "we engage here in the exercise of providing a few estimated upper limits for these contributions .",
    "inferring from a recent analysis on solar and atmospheric neutrinos @xcite , a germanium detector with 0.33 kg active mass and a @xmath112 kev nuclear recoil threshold ( as in the present cogent detector ) would observe a rate of just @xmath110.012 counts / year from coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering from @xmath13b and @xmath14he - proton fusion ( hep ) solar neutrinos , the only solar sources able to produce a signal above threshold .",
    "diffuse supernova background neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos might also contribute , however their rate is reduced by factors of @xmath15 10@xmath16 @xcite and @xmath15 10@xmath17 @xcite , respectively .",
    "geoneutrinos , having energies less than 4.5 mev @xcite , can not produce nuclear recoil energies above the cogent threshold . each of these sources may also induce direct electron scattering . however , the neutrino - electron scattering rate is suppressed by @xmath11 10@xmath17 relative to the neutrino - nucleus coherent scattering rate @xcite .",
    "therefore this other channel can not significantly contribute even taking into account the factor of 32 increase in scattering targets , the absence of a quenching factor , and the higher electron recoil energies .",
    "we notice however that interaction rates large enough to be of interest can be generated by solar neutrinos with enhanced baryonic currents @xcite .",
    "additional mechanisms @xcite are able to generate a phenomenology involving diurnal and yearly modulations in rates .",
    "cogent is the first detector technology specifically designed to look for wimp candidates in the low mass range around 10 gev / c@xmath1 , an area of particular interest in view of existing anomalies in other dark matter experiments , recent phenomenological work in particle physics , and possible signals using indirect detection methods @xcite .",
    "however , investigation of the largely unexplored @xmath11few kev recoil energy range brings along new challenges in the understanding of low - energy backgrounds .",
    "the experience accumulated during the ongoing cogent data - taking at sul demonstrates that ppc detectors have excellent properties of long - term stability , simplicity of design , and ease of operation .",
    "this makes them highly suitable in searches for the annual modulation signature expected from dark matter particles forming a galactic halo .",
    "besides their excellent energy resolution , low energy threshold and ability to reject surface backgrounds , ppcs compare well to other solid - state detectors under several criteria : a ) the relative simplicity of cogent s data analysis results in comparable irreducible spectra regardless of analysis pipeline , b ) the response to nuclear recoils is satisfactorily understood , resulting in a reliable nuclear recoil energy scale , c ) uninterrupted stable operation of ppc detectors can be expected over very long ( several year ) timescales .",
    "we plan to continue improving this technology and our understanding of low - energy backgrounds within the framework of a cogent expansion , the c-4 experiment @xcite .",
    "we are indebted to jeffrey de jong and alec habig ( minos collaboration ) for sharing with us information on radon and muon rates at sul , and to all sul personnel for their constant support in operating the cogent detector .",
    "work sponsored by nsf grants phy-0653605 and phy-1003940 , the kavli foundation , and the pnnl ultra - sensitive nuclear measurement initiative ldrd program ( information release number pnnl - sa-90298 ) .",
    "and t.w.h . are supported by the doe / nnsa stewardship science graduate fellowship program ( grant number de - fc52 - 08na28752 ) and the intelligence community ( ic ) postdoctoral research fellowship program , respectively .                                                            as a consistency test ,",
    "the same corrected spectrum at the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : steps ] can be recovered by ignoring the 90% c.l .",
    "fast pulser cut , and applying in lieu of it the overall fraction of fast events derived from fits like those in figure  [ fig : surface_fits ] . following a sufficiently long exposure ,",
    "the distribution in rise time of surface and bulk events becomes self - evident , making possible to calculate bulk sa and surface br for any choice of rise time cuts .",
    "this supersedes the electronic pulser method , which is limited by only providing a bulk sa , but no surface br information .",
