    "<S> soft x - ray spectroscopy is used to investigate the strain dependence of the metal - insulator transition of vo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> changes in the strength of the v @xmath1 - o @xmath2 hybridization are observed across the transition , and are linked to the structural distortion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , although the v - v dimerization is well - described by dynamical mean - field theory , the v - o hybridization is found to have an unexpectedly strong dependence on strain that is not predicted by band theory , emphasizing the relevance of the o ion to the physics of vo@xmath0 .    of the materials that exhibit a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , </S>",
    "<S> vo@xmath0 has been an exquisite textbook example for the last five decades @xcite , with its large ( @xmath3 ) discontinuity in the conductivity and the rich tunability of its properties with alloying or strain . despite such intense interest </S>",
    "<S> , however , the nature of the transition itself still remains a challenge to explain . in the past , debate about whether the transition is driven by the lattice @xcite ( peierls physics ) or by electron correlation effects @xcite ( mott - hubbard physics ) fuelled interest ; more recently , the general consensus amongst experiment and theory alike is for a co - operative model , in which both pictures are important to the mit . </S>",
    "<S> key to understanding such a co - operative model has been the behavior of the transition with applied strain and alloying @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> technologically , interest in this material has focused on the dramatic changes of its optical properties through the transition , coupled with its ultra - fast nature @xcite , that make it an excellent candidate for applications such as fast optical switches .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential application of vo@xmath0 as a novel functional material has recently been accelerated by advances in its thin film growth @xcite , and such interest has been fuelled by the possibility of tailoring the mit ( including to below room temperature ) through doping and/or strained thin films epitaxially grown on oriented tio@xmath0 substrates . </S>",
    "<S> however , the introduction of strain to the lattice ( at ambient pressure ) raises new questions on the physics of vo@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the role of the lattice has important implications for the timescale of the transition , and many of the envisaged technological applications of vo@xmath0 hinge on its ultra - fast nature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the structural transition is known to impose a bottleneck on the timescale of the transition of bulk vo@xmath0 @xcite . meanwhile , the effects of strain on the mechanism of the mit are not well - established : in bulk vo@xmath0 , small amounts of applied uniaxial stress stabilize the @xmath4 phase @xcite , whereas for nb - doped vo@xmath0 ( of nb concentrations @xmath5% ) the chemical pressure induces an insulating rutile phase @xcite ( i.e.  with no accompanying structural distortion ) . in this letter , using a combination of soft x - ray spectroscopies , we show that the mit of moderately strained vo@xmath0 still involves the lattice , and reveal that the role of the o ion has a surprising dependence on the strain that is not anticipated by band theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the essential features of the electronic structure of vo@xmath0 can be understood rather well from a simple molecular orbital perspective @xcite . in this picture , the v @xmath1 orbitals form three well - separated states in the high - temperature rutile ( @xmath6 ) structure . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the @xmath7 ( also labeled @xmath8 ) states overlap in energy with the so - called @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) states that run along the rutile @xmath11-axis ( @xmath12-axis ) , leading to a metallic phase . accompanying the mit , </S>",
    "<S> a structural distortion into the monoclinic @xmath13 phase leads to the dimerization of v atoms in the @xmath12-axis , splitting the @xmath9 state into bonding and anti - bonding states . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the tilting of the vo@xmath14 octahedra in the @xmath13 structure increases the v - o hybridization , and pushes the @xmath7 state upwards in energy , deoccupying it and leading to an insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , early measurements of the properties of nb- and cr - doped vo@xmath0 @xcite revealed features of the phase diagram inconsistent with the neglect of electron correlations , e.g.  an insulating rutile phase and the presence of the @xmath4 phase ( in which only half the v atoms dimerize ) . in the model of zylbersztejn and mott @xcite , strong correlations in the @xmath9 band are screened in the metallic phase by the @xmath7 band . in the insulating phase , these @xmath7 states are empty , and the unscreened correlations open the gap .        attempts to describe the electronic structure from first - principles have had mixed success : the local density approximation ( lda ) has not been able to account for the insulating phase , leading to a metallic solution for both @xmath6 and @xmath13 structures @xcite . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusion of static correlations in the lda+u method correctly predict an insulating @xmath13 phase but can not describe the @xmath6 phase for reasonable values of @xmath15 @xcite . more recently , dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations @xcite and hse hybrid functional calculations @xcite have been able to describe both phases well .    </S>",
    "<S> x - ray spectroscopy is a powerful tool for addressing the electronic structure of complex materials , capable of revealing both the unoccupied and occupied site - specific partial density of states ( pdos ) in the form of x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> further , by rotating the polarization vector of the incident x - rays , it is possible to couple to orbitals of different symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> xas measurements at the o @xmath16-edge of pure , bulk vo@xmath0 @xcite have revealed the main features of the unoccupied o @xmath2 pdos : peaks separated by @xmath17  ev in the metallic phase are related to the @xmath7 and @xmath18 states . in the insulating phase , an additional peak owing to the @xmath9 orbital develops at @xmath19  ev above @xmath7 . </S>",

    "<S> the spectra are in excellent qualitative agreement with the data of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : in the metallic phase , two peaks are observed that correspond to the @xmath7 and @xmath18 unoccupied states .    turning our attention to the temperature dependence of the spectra , an additional peak @xmath19  ev above the @xmath7 develops in the insulating phase for @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> the assignment of this peak as the @xmath9 state that has previously been observed for bulk vo@xmath0 @xcite is confirmed by its polarization dependence : it is absent in both samples for @xmath28 . at the bottom of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xas]a , b , the difference between the insulating and metallic spectra for @xmath27 is shown , highlighting the contribution from the @xmath9 states . for compressive vo@xmath0(001 ) , the peak energy is found to be offset by 0.85  ev from the @xmath7 band , close to the @xmath19  ev observed for bulk vo@xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand , for tensilely strained vo@xmath0(110 ) , the @xmath9 peak shifts down in energy to 0.7  ev . </S>",
    "<S> these results are in good agreement with the strain - dependence of the @xmath9 state from dmft calculations , in which the offset between the @xmath7 and @xmath9 state are calculated to be 0.7 and 0.9  ev for tensive and compressive @xmath12-axis strain ( each of 2% magnitude ) respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this observation of the unoccupied @xmath9 band , and its dependence on strain , in the insulating phase of moderately strained vo@xmath0 is evidence of a substantial v - v dimerizing structural distortion , similar to the @xmath13 or @xmath4 phases of bulk vo@xmath0 . factor analysis @xcite of spectra recorded during a heating cycle through the transition ( shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xas]c ) revealed only two eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> the data were reproduced by a linear combination of the insulating and metallic end - members , supporting real - space measurements that suggest the absence of an intermediate phase and lack of dimerization above the mit @xcite .    by resonantly exciting the system at an energy that corresponds to a feature in the xas spectrum , it is possible to measure the site - selective occupied pdos . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xes]a the v @xmath29-edge resonant xes ( rxes ) spectra of the two samples in near - grazing geometry are shown above and below the mit , and correspond to the fluorescent decay of occupied v @xmath1 states to the empty v @xmath2 core hole created in the excitation process ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details of the geometry of these measurements ) . </S>",
    "<S> three principal features are observed in these spectra . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the peak at 0  ev is due to elastically scattered x - rays , whose intensity is found to vary with @xmath12-axis strain . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the feature centered at @xmath30  ev represents a combination of fluorescence from occupied ` pure ' v @xmath1 orbitals , located just below @xmath31 , and low - energy inelastic loss features . </S>",
    "<S> although the separation of these two components is complicated by their proximity in energy , analysis of their angular dependence and comparison with photoemission measurements establish that the loss features are predominantly located below @xmath32  ev . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the strong kink in the vo@xmath0(110 ) spectra at @xmath32  ev separate the two components , analogous to the double - peaked structure observed for mo - doped vo@xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the double - peaked structure observed in our data has a different origin to that observed in photoemission measurements ( see , for example , refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . finally , the broader peak centered @xmath33  ev represents v @xmath1 states hybridized with o @xmath2 states ; the data presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xes]a have been normalized to this hybridized component . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is in agreement with other vanadates @xcite , including cr - doped vo@xmath0 @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) rxes spectra of vo@xmath0(110 ) and vo@xmath0(001 ) above and below the mit recorded at the v @xmath29-edge peak maximum . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of bulk @xmath13 vo@xmath0 is also shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra have been normalized to the o @xmath2 hybridized peak and are presented on an energy - loss scale and vertically offset . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) v @xmath29-edge rxes and ( c ) o @xmath16-edge xes spectra of both samples at room temperature on a common emission energy axis . ]    focusing first on the behavior of the spectra across the transition , both samples exhibit a substantial change in the ratio of the v @xmath1 peak to the o @xmath2 hybridized peak , with a stronger contribution from the pure v @xmath1 states in the metallic @xmath6 phase . considering the occupation of the v @xmath1 band to be approximately constant across the transition , this change in intensity </S>",
    "<S> is interpreted as an increase in the hybridization between o @xmath2 and v @xmath1 states in going from the metallic to the insulating phase . for v@xmath34cr@xmath35o@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> a similar change in this ratio was observed as a consequence of cr - doping , and was associated with the decrease in the lattice parameter [ in particular , the ( 110)@xmath36 lattice spacing ] induced by cr ion substitution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for bulk rutile vo@xmath0 , the nearest - neighbor v - o distance is 1.92   . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the @xmath13 phase , the structural distortion ( dimerization of v - v ions and particularly their associated twisting in the vo@xmath14 octahedra ) reduces this to 1.76   , substantially increasing the overlap of the v @xmath1 and o @xmath2 wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> together with our xas measurements , the rxes data establish that a structural distortion accompanies the mit that increases the overlap between the v @xmath1 and o @xmath2 wave functions , in a similar manner to the @xmath13 or @xmath4 bulk phases .    </S>",
    "<S> turning now to the behavior of the spectra as a function of strain , it is evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xes]a that there is a large change in the v @xmath1 - o @xmath2 hybridization between the two samples . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f : xes]b shows the rxes spectra on a common emission energy axis recorded _ during the same measurement _ , eliminating ambiguity in the energy calibration of the spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the location of the o @xmath2 ( hybridized ) feature is rigidly shifted upwards in energy by almost 1  ev for vo@xmath0(110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> owing to the proximity of loss features , the shift of the v @xmath1 pdos is harder to accurately judge , but it is clear that any shift of these states is weaker . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates the v and o states are closer together in energy for vo@xmath0(110 ) , facilitating their enhanced hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this enhanced hybridization can be directly visualized in the data through the relative intensity of the o @xmath2 hybridized feature compared with the v @xmath1 peak . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , such behavior can be understood from the evolution of the @xmath37-axis lattice parameter with strain . for vo@xmath0(001 ) , the @xmath38-axis is expanded , accommodating the strain , and the @xmath39-bonded v @xmath1 and o @xmath2 orbitals are pulled further apart , decreasing their respective hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> however , such strong strain - dependent changes in the hybridization between v and o states is not expected from band theory and hint towards a more significant role for the o ion than previously considered in the physics of the mit of vo@xmath0 . shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> f : xes]a ) . </S>",

    "<S> the broader bandwidth of vo@xmath0(110 ) is due to the enhanced hybridization with v @xmath1 states , in agreement with the rxes data , and supported by the closer proximity , and indeed merging , of the knee to the onset of emission from the o @xmath2 manifold .    finally , in fig .
