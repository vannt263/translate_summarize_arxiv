    "the spontaneous breakdown of symmetries in the early universe that produce linear discontinuities in the field is called cosmic string ( kibble 1976 ) .",
    "the cosmic strings are also common in modern string cosmologies . in 2003 , general interest in cosmic strings was heightened by the discovery of what seemed at first to be a plausible candidate for lensing by a cosmic string . a pair of images of elliptical galaxies separated by 1.8 arc seconds was found to have the same redshift , @xmath1 , and the same spectra .",
    "sazhim et al ( 2003 ) confirmed that these images were not distorted in the way that would be expected for lensing of a single galaxy but are consistent with lensing by cosmic string . in the literature ,",
    "the line like structure of cosmic strings with particle attached to them are considered as possible seeds for galaxy formation at the early stages of the evolution of universe . in the past time , stachel ( 1980 ) , letelier ( 1983 ) and vilenkin et al ( 1987 ) have studied different aspects of string cosmological models in general relativity .",
    "reddy ( 2003 ) , reddy and naidu ( 2007 ) and recently yadav ( 2013 ) have investigated anisotropic string cosmological models in scalar - tensor theory of gravitation . + harko et al ( 2011 ) proposed @xmath0 gravity theory by taking into account the gravitational lagrangian as the function of ricci scalar r and of the trace of energy - stress tensor t. they have obtained the equation of motion of test particle and the gravitational field equation in metric formalism both .",
    "myrzakulov ( 2011 ) presented point like lagrangian s for @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the @xmath0 gravity model that satisfy the local tests and transition of matter from dominated era to accelerated phase was considered by houndjo ( 2012 ) .",
    "recently chaubey and shukla ( 2013 ) , naidu et al ( 2013 ) and ahmad and pradhan ( 2013 ) have investigated anisotropic cosmological model in @xmath0 gravity . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study the role of strings in @xmath0 gravity and bianchi - v space time .",
    "since bianchi - v models are natural generalization of frw models hence the bianchi - v cosmological models permit one to obtain more general cosmological model , in comparison to frw model .",
    "in the recent years several authors ( yadav 2011 , kumar and yadav 2011 , yadav 2012 , pradhan et al 2005 , singh et al 2008 ) have studied bianchi - v cosmological models in different physical context .",
    "+ in this paper , we establish the existence of bianchi - v string cosmological model in @xmath0 gravity and examine a cosmological scenario by proposing power law expansion .",
    "we observe that strings do not survive for long time and eventually disappear from universe .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the model and basic theory of @xmath0 gravity are presented in section 2 .",
    "the field equations are established in section 3 and their solution is presented in section 4 .",
    "section 5 deals with the cosmological parameters and classical potential of derived model .",
    "finally conclusions are presented in section 6 .",
    "we consider the bianchi - v metric in following form @xmath2 here , @xmath3 , @xmath4 & @xmath5 are scale factors in the x , y & z direction respectively and @xmath6 is constant .",
    "+ the action of @xmath0 gravity is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the ricci scalar , the trace of the stress - energy tensor of matter and the matter lagrangian density respectively .",

    "+ the stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath17 in general , the field equations depend through the tensor @xmath18 , on the physical nature of the matter field . hence we obtain several theoretical models for different choice of f(r , t ) depending on the nature of the matter source . in the literature , chaubey @xmath19 shukla ( 2013 ) , reddy et al .",
    "( 2012a , 2012b ) and naidu et al ( 2013 ) have been studied the cosmological models , assuming @xmath20 .",
    "recently ahmad @xmath19 pradhan studied consequence of bianchi - v cosmological model in f(r , t ) gravity by considering @xmath21 .",
    "they have assumed perfect fluid as source of matter while in this paper , we assumed the string fluid as source of matter to describe the physical consequences of early universe .",
    "thus our paper is all together different from the paper of ahmad and pradhan ( 2013 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 is arbitrary parameter .",
    "+ now equation ( [ eq4 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath25 throughout the paper , we use units @xmath26 .",

    "the einstein s field equation ( [ eq6 ] ) for the line - element ( [ eq1 ] ) leads to the following system of equations @xmath32",
    "@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36",

    "thus , in order to completely solve the fields equations , we need at least one physical assumption among the unknown parameters . in the literature , it is common to use the law of variation of hubble s parameter which yields the constant value of deceleration parameter .",
    "this law deals with two type of cosmology ( i ) power law cosmology ( ii ) exponential law cosmology . it is well known that the exponential law projects the dynamics of future universe and such type of model does not have consistency with present day observations .",
    "since we are looking for a model , describing the late time acceleration of universe therefore we choose the average scale factor in following form @xmath44 where @xmath45 , is positive constant .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) can be easily obtain by law of variation of hubble s parameter .",
    "+ we define average scale factor @xmath46 and mean hubble s parameter @xmath47 of the bianchi - v model as @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are directional hubble s parameters in the direction of x , y , and z- direction respectively .",

    "( [ eq33 ] ) , it is clear that the value of @xmath86 in the range @xmath87 increase the age of universe .",

    "in gravitational unit we take @xmath90 . therefore for a physical viable model",

    "the behaviour is quite evident ; the scale factors along axial direction satisfies the anisotropic nature of universe ; @xmath96 shows that the particles dominate over the strings with the evolution of universe hence the strings are not observed today ; the classical potential @xmath97 is positive and speed of sound @xmath98 is less the speed of light throughout the expansion of universe from big bang to present epoch .",
    "in the present paper , we have considered @xmath0 gravity model with an arbitrary coupling between matter and geometry in bianchi - v space - time .",
    "we have derived the gravitational field equations for string fluid corresponding to @xmath0 gravity model .",
    "we observed that string tension density @xmath72 decreases with time and it approaches to zero at present epoch .",
    "therefore strings could not survive with the evolution process of universe .",
    "that is why the strings are not observed today but it play significant role in early universe .",
    "the classical potential @xmath97 is positive and it decreases with time .",
    "the scale factors vanish at @xmath99 .",
    "thus the model has point type singularity at @xmath99 . as @xmath100 the scale factors diverge and the physical parameters such as expansion , scalar @xmath27 , energy density @xmath71 and hubble s parameters @xmath47 tend to zero .",
    "therefore in the derived model , all matter and radiation are concentrated in the big bang .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath100 in the derived model which implies the fastest rate of expansion of universe .",
    "so , the derived model can be utilized to describe the dynamics of universe at present epoch . since @xmath103 ,",
