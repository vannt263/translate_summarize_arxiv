    "reaction  [ eq2 ] , involving h@xmath6d@xmath0 , is usually considered as the main source of dco@xmath0 in disks at low temperatures ( see * ? ? ?",

    "one notable feature of figures  [ fg3 ] and  [ fg4 ] is that the formation of dco@xmath0 in the inner surface layers inside of 60  au involves ch@xmath1d@xmath0 or one of its product that have previously been created by reaction  [ eq3 ] .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fg3 ] shows the abundance of the dco@xmath0 ion for up to the 60  au when reaction  [ eq3 ] is activated ( left panel ) and turned off ( right panel ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that reaction  [ eq3 ] , which involves the ch@xmath1d@xmath0 channel , leads to the observed maximal dco@xmath0 abundance in the inner surface layers of the disk .",
    "likewise , a similar result is observed on the abundance profiles of dcn and hdco ( see figure  [ fg3 ] ) , molecules that can both also be formed through reaction [ eq3 ] .",
    "in addition , in figure  [ fg4 ] , we give the radial distribution of some key ions ( such as ch@xmath1d@xmath0 and ch@xmath26d@xmath0 ) that can lead to the formation of dco@xmath0 along with the one for h@xmath6d@xmath0 when reaction  [ eq3 ] is activated ( top panel ) and turned off ( bottom panel ) . a decrease in the dco@xmath0 , ch@xmath1d@xmath0 , ch@xmath27d@xmath0 and ch@xmath26d@xmath0 column density",
    "is clearly observed when reaction  [ eq3 ] is not activated in our network . finally , we find that more than 80@xmath24 of the dco@xmath0 abundance in the inner 60  au surface layers is due to a dco@xmath0 formation through the reactions  [ eq3 ] , [ eq4 ] and [ eq5 ] pathway .      in figure  [ fg5 ]",
    ", we show that the use of the new exothermicities leads the warm channel ( i.e. reaction [ eq3 ] ) to dominate in the dco@xmath0 production . more specifically ,",
    "[ fg5 ] illustrates the impact , within the inner disk , of the change of exothermicity on the dco@xmath0/hco@xmath0 abundance ratio but also on that of other easily observable molecules ( dcn , formaldehyde ) .",
    "one notable feature is that the abundance of dco@xmath0 , dcn and hdco is enhanced in the 20  au inner radii when the chemical modeling includes the new exothermicities set by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath11e of 654  k for reaction [ eq3 ] ) as opposed to the chemical modeling that includes the previous ones ( @xmath11e = 370  k , see * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , it is immediately apparent that within the 20  au inner radii the distribution of the dco@xmath0/hco@xmath0 abundance ratio is affected by the change of exothermicity : the latter does not increase with increasing radius while using the most recent exothermicities @xcite , whereas assuming a lower exothermicity ( i.e. the one of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the ratio shows a rise with increasing radius in the inner disk .",
    "our results are a consequence of the increase in the exothermicity @xmath11e of reaction  [ eq3 ] , as suggested by @xcite , which favors deuterium fractionation in warm gas , up to temperatures even as high as t @xmath28 300  k. we note that in the case of dco@xmath0 only , which has its main formation route from channel [ eq5 ] and , for an exothermicity of 654  k , a temperature @xmath2971  k is hot enough to turn off the dco@xmath0 enrichment toward the inner disk .",
    "indeed , the activation of the backward reaction is shifted to higher temperatures , enabling efficient deuteration closer to the star .",
    "this is a nice illustration of the influence of the energy budget of deuteration reactions .",
    "this is similar to the well known effect of the h@xmath1 ortho / para ratio on deuterium chemistry ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : at low temperature , the backward counterpart of reaction  [ eq1 ] is strongly favored for ortho - h@xmath1 over para - h@xmath1 , due to a lower @xmath30 for the former .",
    "however , we did not consider the spin states of h@xmath1 in the present study .",
    "dco@xmath2 being mainly produced by reaction  [ eq3 ] , we do not expect this omission to be of crucial importance in the present case ( see sect . 4.4 for further details ) .",
    "dco@xmath0 has been proposed to be a good tracer of the co snow line by @xcite , assuming h@xmath1d@xmath0 as its parent molecule . however , our study points out that the reaction which involves h@xmath1d@xmath0 as a parent molecule ( see reaction  [ eq2 ] ) is unlikely to be the main formation route that leads to the bulk of the dco@xmath0 abundance within the disk .",
    "alternatively , our study shows that reactions involving ch@xmath1d@xmath0 as a parent molecule of dco@xmath0 ( see reaction  [ eq3 ] and reactions [ eq4 ] and [ eq5 ] as possible pathways for the formation of dco@xmath0 ) are responsible for the observed high abundance of dco@xmath0 in the inner surface layers of the disk .",
    "this finding leads us to argue that , instead of temperature , dco@xmath0 is rather tracing ionization .",
    "indeed , the distribution of the dco@xmath0 abundance is similar to the one of co except for its high abundance in the the inner warmer surface layers of the disk where ionization through x - rays is present . in that respect ,",
    "we predict that dco@xmath2 is a tracer of the inner tens of au of protoplanetary disks surrounding x - ray active t tauri stars .",
    "chemical pathways involving the ch@xmath1d@xmath0 channel ( reaction [ eq3 ] ) can sufficiently lead to the formation of different deuterated molecules , such as dco@xmath0 , dcn , hdco in warm conditions ( e.g. t@xmath1770100  k , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in that context",
    ", our study not only shows that the high abundance of dco@xmath0 in the inner disk results from pathways involving the ch@xmath1d@xmath0 ion as a parent molecule , but in addition shows that the dcn and hdco abundance patterns are also affected by the change of exothermicity ( see figs  [ fg3 ] and [ fg5 ] ) .",
    "indeed , the dcn and hdco abundances are enhanced while using the ch@xmath1d@xmath0 formation route with the most recent exothermicities ( @xmath11e=654  k , * ? ? ?",
    "interestingly enough , from their alma observations , @xcite analyzed the dco@xmath2 emission in the disk surrounding hd  163296 as coming from a narrow ( confined between 110 and 160 au ) ring - like structure .",
    "although the radial extent of the ring may be subject to revision ( qi et al .",
    ", in prep ) , such a narrow ring , located far from the star , is difficult to reconcile with our modeling .",
    "likewise , based on sma observations @xcite of the tw  hydrae disk and empirical fitting of the data , @xcite find a central depression and inferred a dco@xmath0 abundance profile that increases with abundance with the radius .",
    "these suggestions disagree with our results , since we find that with a higher activation barriers @xcite the warm channel ( reaction  [ eq3 ] ) dominates , leading to a strong abundance of dco@xmath0 in the inner regions of the disk . one possible caveat could be the ortho : para ratio .",
    "@xcite have investigated the effect of the ortho : para ratio on the deuterium fractionation and have found that , by a million years , the o : p ratio is low .",
    "however , assuming a higher o : p ratio might change our results by reducing the deuterium enhancement .",
    "@xcite show that the exothermicity in reaction [ eq3 ] is reduced if there is significant amount of ortho - h@xmath1 present in the gas ( see table 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , the backward reaction is actually comparable to the old warm channel rates @xcite .",
    "thus , one way to chemically mimic a hole in the dco@xmath0 distribution is to have a gradient in the o : p ratio in the disk which is higher in the inner regions and lower in the outer disk .",
    "another possible caveat could be the ionization structure .",
    "the presence of structure in the inner disk could perhaps prevent the propagation of the x ",
    "ray photons in the inner disk and may lead to a reduced production of dco@xmath0 .",
    "however , this effect may not be as important for the more substantially flared outer disk .",
    "finally , the disk surrounding hd  163296 is much warmer than our tw  hydrae disk model . in this disk ,",
    "the co snow line is located around 150  au @xcite , while it is around 20  au in our model .",
    "another possibility would thus be that the hd  163296 disk is warm enough ( t@xmath2971  k ) and/or present a higher o : p ratio to enable endothermic reactions to prevent deuterium fractionation in the inner 100  au , thereby truncating the dco@xmath2 layer .",
    "direct modeling of the dco@xmath2 chemistry in the warm disk surrounding hd  163296 would be necessary for further comparisons .",
    "in any case , further observations of hd  163296 and tw  hya are required to understand the dco@xmath2 distribution , at the light of our new dco@xmath2 formation pathway .",
    "to summarize , our study shows that the high abundance of dco@xmath0 in the inner surface layers of the disk results from ch@xmath1d@xmath0 as a parent molecule .",
    "the latter being efficiently formed through reaction  [ eq3 ] in warm conditions ( typically t@xmath2871  k ) . as a consequence we suggest that dco@xmath0 is a reliable tracer of ionization in the inner warm disk surface .",
    "furthermore , the change in exothermicity , in the instance of a low o / p ratio , leads to enhancements of other tracers including dcn and hdco ."
