    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) lies in the direction of the galactic center : @xmath3 .",
    "the distance to is somewhat uncertain .",
    "since the distance to the snr is important to the conclusions of the current study , it is useful to examine previous estimates of the distance found in the literature .",
    "many authors have used the @xmath4 relation to derive a distance to near @xmath52 kpc ( milne 1970 ; clark & caswell 1976 ; goudis 1976 ; milne 1979 ) ; however , as discussed by kaspi ( 1993 ) , this method is extremely uncertain .",
    "the furthest distance estimated in the literature is 3.6 kpc by lozinskaya ( 1974 ) , based on h@xmath6 measurements and assuming an lsr velocity near + 18for .",
    "velazquez ( 2002 ) estimate a distance of 1.9@xmath20.3 kpc adopting + 7for the lsr velocity , and assuming a standard circular rotation model ( this is the near kinematic distance ; 15 kpc is the far kinematic distance ) .",
    "frail , kulkarni , & vasisht ( 1993 ) adopt a distance of 3 kpc , based on hi absorption , assuming an lsr velocity of 17.6 .",
    "while the weight of the evidence for distance estimates to favors a lower distance ( @xmath5 2 kpc ; the argument of velazquez 2002 for an lsr velocity of + 7is especially strong ) , we adopt a conservative estimate for the distance to of 2.5@xmath20.7 kpc .",
    "the 60,000 year old pulsar psr  b1578@xmath123 lies in the same direction as but is located outside the snr , approximately three arcminutes to the north of its bright radio continuum edge .",
    "a radio continuum source , 18 ( also known as 1758@xmath1231 ) , lies within two arcminutes of this pulsar .",
    "18 is assumed to be an extragalactic source , coincidentally along the line of sight to the pulsar , based on measurements of neutral hydrogen absorption ( frail , kulkarni , & vasisht 1993 ) . using observations of the pulsar and the neighboring extragalactic source , frail et al .",
    "argued in favor of the association of the pulsar and the snr .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) disagreed , suggesting that the pulsar was much more distant .",
    "the discussion of frail was based upon the similarity of hi absorption profiles toward the pulsar and extragalactic source .",
    "kaspi et al .",
    "base their conclusion on the high dispersion measure of the pulsar ( 1074 pc @xmath7 ) , and the argument that no compact hii region or cloud appears to lie along the line of sight to the pulsar which could account for such a high dispersion measure .",
    "several oh ( 1720 mhz ) masers associated with the snr ( frail , goss , & slysh 1994 ) have been studied at high angular resolution with the very long baseline array ( vlba ) and merlin by claussen ( 1999a ) . though there have been only a few oh(1720 mhz ) masers in observed at 10 mas resolution , those masers are resolved and have sizes ranging from 50 to 100 milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "claussen discussed the effects of interstellar scattering on the sizes of the masers and the constraints that could be placed on such scattering sizes based on available information about the size of 18 , the pulsar , and the pulse broadening of the pulsar .",
    "interstellar scattering of an extragalactic source results in angular broadening while interstellar scattering of a pulsar s radio emission can also result in pulse broadening , an increase in the apparent width of a pulsar s average pulse profile beyond its intrinsic width .",
    "the degree of angular broadening for the masers and the extragalactic source and the degree of pulse broadening for the pulsar all depend in different ways upon the relative geometry of the observer , scattering material , and sources .",
    "measurements of these scattering effects can constrain the distribution of the scattering material and can be used to estimate , for example , the unscattered sizes of the masers .    in this paper , we present angular broadening measurements of the extragalactic source 18 as a function of observing frequency from 1285 mhz to 4885 mhz .",
    "we used the nrao very large array ( vla ) in its most extended configuration ( * a * ) linked , in real time , with the pie town ( pt ) antenna of the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "the questions to be addressed by these measurements are ( 1 ) the relative distances of the pulsar and the supernova remnant ( which we assume harbors the oh masers ) , ( 2 ) the effects of scattering on the observed size of the masers and the pulsar , and ( 3 ) the distance to the scattering screen .",
    "the vlba pie town ( pt ) antenna has been linked in real time via fiber - optic cable with the vla ( claussen et al . 1999b ; beresford 2000 ) . for purposes of scientific observations",
    ", the data from the pt antenna is sent to the vla correlator just like any other vla antenna . for sources with declinations",
    "@xmath8 40 , the angular resolution in two dimensions is improved by approximately a factor two compared with using the vla in the * a * configuration .",
    "as the declination of sources tends to the south , the increase in resolution is realized in only one dimension .",
    "we observed the extragalactic source 18 on january 15 , 2001 , with the vla+pt link .",
    "we performed five snapshots of the source of approximately 10 minutes each on source at six frequencies : 1285 , 1315 , 1365 , 1665 , 1715 , and 4885 mhz .",
    "the five snapshots covered an hour angle range of about @xmath21.5 hours . at the frequencies",
    "1285 to 1715 mhz , we employed 25 mhz front - end filters to help avoid radio - frequency interference and minimize the radial smearing due to the effects of finite bandwidth ( see e.g. bridle & schwab 1999 , and references therein ) . at 4885 mhz",
    "the filters were set at 50 mhz .",
    "two independent circular polarizations were observed at each frequency , and subsequently averaged in the imaging process .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated , and imaged in the standard manner , using the nrao astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "absolute flux calibration was provided assuming that 3c  286 has flux densities of 15.44 , 15.27 , 15.01 , 13.63 , 13.43 , and 7.46 jy beam@xmath9 at 1285 , 1315 , 1365 , 1665 , 1715 , and 4885 mhz respectively .",
    "uniform weighting of the _ u , v _ data was used in the imaging to allow the data from pt baselines to contribute to the image .",
    "the aips task jmfit was used to fit two - dimensional gaussians to the brightness distribution of 18 , and to deconvolve the synthesized beam from those fits .",
    "table 1 shows a summary of the observations , imaging , and gaussian fits to the images of 18 . since the sizes of the radio source measured by fitting and deconvolving the observed size are nearly circular , the deconvolved sizes reported in table 1 are the geometric mean of the two - dimensional gaussian fits .",
    "we also detected the pulsar b1758@xmath123 ; the image of the pulsar suffers from severe bandwidth smearing , since it is two arcminutes from the phase center .",
    "accurate size measurements of the pulsar are thus compromised .",
    "however , we attempted to correct the measured sizes of the pulsar by estimating the magnitude of the smearing . at all frequencies ,",
    "the best estimate of the size of the pulsar is @xmath10 0.5  arcseconds .",
    "figure 1 shows the results of our angular size measurements of 18 : a log - log plot of the deconvolved size @xmath11 versus observing frequency . a well - known frequency scaling relation exists for the measured angular size of a source whose structure is dominated by interstellar scattering effects ( rickett 1977 ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 takes on a value between @xmath12 and @xmath12.2 .",
    "for reference , we have drawn a line with slope @xmath14 in figure 1 ; it is clear that the measured sizes shown are consistent with the effects of interstellar scattering .    under the assumption that the intervening turbulence is confined to a single thin screen",
    ", scattering measurements of galactic and extragalactic compact sources can completely constrain the location of the screen .",
    "the assumption that the scattering screen is thin is equivalent to the statement that the scattering screen has a thickness which is much less than the distance to the extragalactic source ( e.g. trotter , moran , & rodrguez 1998 ) . since the extragalactic source is likely to be at least several megaparsec away , a thickness of several pc for the screen is consistent with this assumption .",
    "temporal broadening of the pulsed emission from a pulsar and angular broadening of pulsars and masers depend differently upon the distribution of scattering material along the line of sight . additionally , angular broadening of the extragalactic source 18 is sensitive only to the strength of the turbulence , not to its distribution along the line of sight .",
    "in addition to the angular size measurements of 18 and the pulsar psr b1758@xmath123 reported here , we also use the measured size of the oh masers ( claussen et al .",
    "1999a ) , and the measured temporal broadening of the pulse of the pulsar ( kaspi et al .",
    "1993 ; frail , kulkarni , & vasisht 1993 ) in order to estimate 1 ) the distance to the pulsar , 2 ) the distance to the scattering screen , and 3 ) the unscattered size of the oh masers . in order",
    "to make these estimates , we make the further assumption that the scattering screen is uniform across both the pulsar and the extragalactic source ( the two radio sources are separated by about 2 arcminutes ) . at a distance of 10 kpc ,",
    "2 arcminutes corresponds to about 6 pc . on pc scales , it is not unreasonable to expect that the scattering medium is at least somewhat uniform . lazio et .",
    "al ( 1999 ) find that the galactic center scattering region ( covering sgr a * , oh masers , and extragalactic sources ) is inhomogeneous on scales of order 10 pc , whereas fey , spangler , & mutel ( 1989 ) find that scattering in the cygnus region changes by factors of two to five over angular separations of a few degrees ( 100200 pc ) .",
    "if we denote the measured sizes of the extragalactic source , the pulsar , and the oh(1720 mhz ) masers as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , the distance to the scattering screen , the masers , and the pulsar as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively , and the temporal broadening of the pulsar as @xmath20 , then three relevant relations can be derived ( e. g. britton , gwinn , & ojeda 1998 ; frail , kulkarni , & vasisht 1993 ) : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless while @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are in radians , @xmath20 is in seconds , and @xmath29 is the speed of light .",
    "we can rearrange these equations to obtain :    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32    in distance units of kpc , time units of seconds , and angular units of arcseconds , equation becomes : @xmath33 and equation 4 becomes @xmath34 measurements of the three angular sizes @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and the broadening time @xmath20 , will thus lead to a determination of @xmath37 , and @xmath19 .    in practice ,",
    "the angular sizes and the broadening time are measured at different frequencies . since",
    "scattering quantities are frequency dependent , we must transform the measurements to a common frequency .",
    "the choice of frequency is obviously the frequency of the maser angular size measurement , 1720 mhz .",
    "the size measurement of the oh masers is subject to two different interpretations : scattering due to interstellar turbulence or large intrinsic maser sizes ( lockett et al .",
    "we therefore scale all measurements to 1720 mhz and apply the above relations at that single frequency .",
    "theoretically , @xmath20  scales with @xmath38 while @xmath39 scale with @xmath40 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , @xmath13 can take on a value between @xmath12.0 and @xmath12.2  the exact value used for @xmath13  will have a substantial effect on the derived quantities .",
    "uncertainties in the measurement of the sizes and the pulse broadening , along with the uncertainty in @xmath13 , lead to a range of possible estimates of the distances to the pulsar and the scattering screen and the size of the pulsar .",
    "although there is considerable uncertainty as mentioned above , a clear result can be obtained if we consider the direct measurement of the size of 18 at 1715 mhz ( @xmath41220 mas ) .",
    "a plot of the distance to the pulsar vs the distance to the scattering screen , using this value for @xmath42 in equation 7 is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the pulse broadening time @xmath20  in equation 7 , necessary for the plot , was estimated by frail to be 0.07 seconds at 1670 mhz .",
    "the 1520 mhz pulse profile in kaspi is consistent with a slightly smaller 1670 mhz value in the range 0.055 to 0.057 seconds .",
    "both of these measurements taken together would suggest a value for @xmath20 at 1720 mhz in the range 0.048 to 0.051 seconds . in our analysis",
    "we find that there are no significant differences in our conclusions using this range of values for @xmath20 .",
    "the plot in figure 2 uses the mean of pulse broadening times , 0.0495 seconds .",
    "dashed lines in figure 2 show the same relation for pulsar distance  screen distance for @xmath43 and @xmath44 mas . for @xmath45 mas ,",
    "figure 2 shows a clear minimum for the pulsar distance of about 9.4 kpc , which requires the scattering screen to be at a distance of 4.7 kpc .",
    "the snr distance of 2.5 kpc is also plotted on figure 2 , for reference .",
    "the solid line in figure 2 is determined directly from equation 7 with @xmath46 seconds and @xmath45 mas , so we can analytically determine where the minimum pulsar distance occurs .",
    "equation 7 can be written as a quadratic equation in @xmath17 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 the solutions ( for @xmath17 ) to this quadratic equation are @xmath49 we can determine a minimum value for @xmath19 by taking the derivative @xmath50 .",
    "this leads to the well - known relation @xmath51 ( e.g. gwinn , bartel , & cordes 1993 ) .",
    "this minimum value of @xmath19 occurs when @xmath52 and @xmath53 . since @xmath53 is not an acceptable solution",
    ", we find that the minimum value for @xmath19 is @xmath54 .",
    "table 2 lists a few values for @xmath55 and the value of @xmath17 where @xmath55 occurs , using values of @xmath42 which bracket the errors of our measurements .",
    "the entries in table 2 show that , even for values of @xmath42 outside our one - sigma errors , the minimum distance for the pulsar is well beyond the distance to the snr . based on these values in table 2",
    ", we can estimate the uncertainty in the minimum pulsar distance to be @xmath22.4 kpc , with a corresponding uncertainty in the screen distance to be @xmath21.2 kpc .    with an estimate of the minimum distance to the pulsar and a corresponding distance to the screen established",
    ", we can use equation 8 to estimate the scattered size of the pulsar .",
    "this estimate is 110@xmath215 mas at 1720 mhz , well below our upper limit for the size of the pulsar .",
    "table 2 also lists the values of the pulsar scattered sizes ( @xmath28 ) for different values of @xmath42 .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that smaller values of the screen distance are possible for a given value of @xmath42 , as the pulsar distance increases ( to the left of the minimum pulsar distance in figure 2 ) .",
    "we can use the solid curve in figure 2 , in conjunction with equation 2 , to estimate the size of the oh(1720 mhz ) masers ( @xmath36 ) , based on an extreme value for the pulsar distance . selecting a pulsar distance of 15 kpc ,",
    "the screen distance would have to be 2.9 kpc , and thus the ratio of the extragalactic source size to the maser source size ( @xmath56 ) would be @xmath533 , predicting a maser scattering size of @xmath10 7 mas . placing the screen closer to the earth along the line of sight ( in order to decrease @xmath26 and",
    "increase the scattering size of the masers ) requires that the pulsar be even more distant , likely outside the galaxy .",
    "these estimates for the distances of the scattering screen and the pulsar have two immediate ramifications : ( 1 ) the pulsar is _ not _ associated with the snr ; and ( 2 ) the oh(1720 mhz ) masers are unscattered , since placing the screen at 4.7 kpc puts it beyond the distance to the supernova remnant ( 2.5 kpc ) .",
    "thus the measured angular sizes of the masers as reported by claussen ( 1999a ) ( 50  100 mas ) are intrinsic to the maser rather than due to interstellar scattering .",
    "finally , our estimate of the distance to the pulsar is more consistent with the dispersion measure of the pulsar as measured by kaspi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) than with a closer distance ( @xmath57 9.5 kpc ) .",
    "we have measured the size of the extragalactic source 18 at six frequencies , and find that our size measurements are consistent with angular broadening due to turbulence in the interstellar medium . together with the size measurements of oh(1720 mhz ) masers , assumed to be associated with the supernova remnant ( claussen et al .",
    "1999a ) , and the temporal broadening of the pulsar b1758@xmath123 ( frail , kulkarni , & vasisht 1993 ; kaspi et al .",
    "1993 ) , the results of the new size measurements of 18 imply :    @xmath58 the minimum distance for the pulsar is 9.4@xmath22.4 kpc and it is _ not _ associated with the snr .",
    "the distance to a single scattering screen for this minimum pulsar distance is 4.7@xmath21.2 kpc , and is also beyond the snr .",
    "@xmath58 the scattering screen can be moved placed closer to the earth by increasing the pulsar distance .",
    "even with an extreme distance to the pulsar , this leads to a negligible scattering contribution to the size of the oh masers .",
    "@xmath58 when the pulsar is placed at the minimum distance of 9.4 kpc , the scattering size of the pulsar , estimated from the 18 size measurements , is about 110 mas at 1720 mhz , consistent with our upper limit to the pulsar size of 500 mas .",
    "we thank walter brisken for estimating the size of the pulsar in the presence of bandwidth smearing , and we also thank an anonymous referee for a careful reading of the manuscript and suggestions which improved the paper .",
