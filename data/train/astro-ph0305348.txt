    "the main aim of this paper is to make a new determination of the chemical abundances of ngc  5307 including the following improvements over previous determinations : the consideration of the temperature structure that affects the helium and heavy elements abundance determinations , the derivation of the o and c abundances from recombination line intensities , the consideration of the collisional excitation of the triplet lines from the @xmath4s level by determining the electron density from many line intensity ratios , and the study of the @xmath4s level optical depth effects on the intensity of the triplet lines by observing a large number of singlet and triplet lines of . to determine the temperature structure it is also important to discuss if the and the [ ] lines originate in the same regions under the same physical conditions . to this effect",
    "we will study the relative line intensities of the multiplet 1 in this object and other gaseous nebulae , moreover for the same reason we will also consider the wavelengths and line widths of the and [ ] lines in ngc  5307 .    in sections 2 and 3 the observations and the reduction procedure are described . in section 4",
    "temperatures and densities are derived from five and four different intensity ratios respectively ; also in this section , the mean square temperature fluctuation , @xmath5 , is determined from the / [ ] line intensity ratios . in section",
    "5 ionic abundances are determined based on recombination lines that are almost independent of the temperature structure , and ionic abundances based on ratios of collisionally excited lines to recombination lines that do depend on the temperature structure of the nebula . in section 6 the total abundances are determined and compared with other determinations for the same object . in sections 7 and 8 we present the discussion and the conclusions .",
    "the observations were obtained with the ultraviolet visual echelle spectrograph , uves @xcite , at the vlt kueyen telescope in chile .",
    "we observed simultaneously with the red and blue arms , each in two settings , covering the region from 3100   to 10360   ( see table  [ tobs ] ) .",
    "the wavelength regions 57835830   and 85408650   were not observed due to the separation between the two ccds used in the red arm .",
    "there were also two small gaps that were not observed , 1008410088   and 1025210259  , because the two redmost orders did not entirely fit within the ccd .",
    "in addition to the long exposure spectra we took 60 second exposures for the four observed wavelength ranges to check for possible saturation effects .",
    "the slit was oriented east - west and the atmospheric dispersion corrector ( adc ) was used to keep the same observed region within the slit regardless of the air mass value .",
    "the slit width was set to 3.0 `` and the slit length was set to 10 '' in the blue arm and to 12 `` in the red arm ; the slit width was chosen to maximize the s / n ratio of the emission lines and to maintain the required resolution to separate most of the weak lines needed for this project . the fwhm resolution for the ngc  5307 lines at a given wavelength",
    "is given by @xmath6 .",
    "the reductions were made for an area of 3 '' @xmath7 10 `` .",
    "the center of the slit was placed 5 '' south of the central star , a region of high emission measure .",
    "the dimensions of the object are 18.8 `` @xmath7 12.9 '' ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "the average seeing during the observations amounted to 0.8 \" .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the iraf echelle reduction package , following the standard procedure of bias subtraction , aperture extraction , flatfielding , wavelength calibration and flux calibration . for flux calibration the standard star eg",
    "247 was observed ; the observing time amounted to 600 seconds in each of the four observed wavelength ranges .",
    "line intensities were measured integrating all the flux in the line between two given limits and over a local continuum estimated by eye . in the few cases of line - blending ,",
    "the line flux of each individual line was derived from a multiple voigt profile fit procedure .",
    "all these measurements were carried out with the splot task of the iraf package .",
    "the reddening coefficient , @xmath8(h@xmath9 ) = 0.59 @xmath10 dex , was determined by fitting the observed @xmath11(h@xmath9)/@xmath11(h balmer lines ) ratios to the theoretical ones computed by @xcite for @xmath12 = 10,000 k and @xmath3 = 2000 @xmath1 , ( see below ) and assuming the extinction law of @xcite .",

    "the seventh column includes the fractional error ( 1@xmath16 ) in the line intensities ; these errors were estimated from a signal - to - noise versus signal curve obtained from a fit to the dispersion in the observed to predicted line intensities for all the measured hydrogen lines .",
    "a total of 184 distinct emission lines were measured ; of them 137 are permitted , 46 are forbidden and 1 is semiforbidden ( see table  [ tlines ] ) . in this tally only the main component of the blended lines is included .",
    "many lines redward of 7000   inclunding several paschen lines and @xmath2 9531 [ ] were detected , but they were strongly affected by atmospheric features in absorption and emission rendering their intensities unreliable .",
    "we derived the heliocentric radial velocity of ngc  5307 based on the 14 strongest and lines and amounts to @xmath17 km sec@xmath18 .",
    "this value is smaller than that derived by @xcite that amounts to @xmath19 km sec@xmath18 , the difference probably is due to the different areas observed by the two groups .",
    "the center of our observing slit was located at about half the distance between the central star and the outer edge of the main body of the nebula .",
    "most of the emission lines show a single line profile because we are observing material moving from a tangential velocity up to an angle of 60 degrees relative to the plane of the sky .",
    "the exceptions are the blue and red components of the @xmath20 6313 [ ] , 6716 [ ] , 6731 [ ] , and 9069 [ ] lines that show a splitting of @xmath21 km sec@xmath18 , because they mainly originate in the outer regions of the nebula . dividing this value by the sine of 60 degrees we find a 2@xmath22 value of about 40 km sec@xmath18 of this material relative to the central star .",

    "[ toii ] it can be seen that the intensity of the lines that originate in the 3p  @xmath95d@xmath96 and 3p @xmath95d@xmath97 energy levels decreases with increasing local density , while the intensity of those lines that originate in the 3p  @xmath95d@xmath98 increases with increasing density .",
    "this is due to the effect of collisional redistribution that increases the population of the high statistical weight levels at the expense of the low statistical weight ones .",

    "in other words : we can not assume the presence of high density knots to explain the difference between the o@xmath29 abundances derived from the [ ] lines and the lines .",
    "consequently we propose to drop the constant temperature assumption , and to explain the apparent difference in abundances as being due to the presence of temperature fluctuations .    in general to reconcile the abundances derived from collisionally excited lines and recombination lines it is necessary to assume the presence of large temperature variations .",
    "the presence of temperature variations in gaseous nebulae has been amply reviewed in the recent literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even more recent results in favor of large temperature variations in the orion nebula , the 30 doradus nebula , and other planetary nebulae have been presented by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , by comparing the line intensities of multiplets 1 , 2 , and 10 for for the planetary nebula ngc  6572 , have concluded that the lines are produced by recombination , and that the contribution of resonance fluorescence to the line intensities is not important .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached @xcite for the orion nebula .",
    "the difference between the o(cel ) abundance and the o(rl ) abundance indicates the presence of large temperature variations .",
    "there are two possible scenarios for these temperature variations : a ) that the abundances are homogeneous along the line of sight and temperature fluctuations of @xmath101 are present , an explanation for these large temperature variations has to be sought ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , or b ) that the abundances are not homogeneous along the line of sight and that there are high density knots with excess heavy element abundances embedded in a medium with lower heavy element abundances and higher electron temperature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second possibility is based on the idea that the central stars , of at least some planetary nebulae , firstly eject an envelope at relatively low velocity with almost normal heavy element abundances , and later on eject knots or clumps of material at higher velocities with an excess of heavy element abundances . in abell  58",
    "@xcite studied a hydrogen deficient high velocity knot blueshifted relative to the main body of the nebula by 120 km s@xmath18 .",
    "while @xcite studied three knots in abell  30 , where knot j1 is redshifted relative to knot j3 by about 45 km s@xmath18 and knot j3 is redshifted relative to knot j4 by about 100 km s@xmath18 .    by assuming that chemical inhomogeneities are responsible for the temperature variations in ngc  5307 we would expect most of the flux of the [ ] lines to originate in the lower density medium that expands at lower velocity , and a considerable fraction of the flux of the lines to originate from knots or clumps that move at higher velocities .",
    "therefore if this were the case the radial velocity derived from the central wavelength of the [ ] lines could be different from that derived from the lines ; furthermore the full width at half maximum , fwhm , of the [ ] lines would be smaller than that of the lines .    for ngc  5307 the heliocentric velocity of the @xmath20 4363",

    "the c abundance derived by us is based on the @xmath2 4267 recombination line , while those derived by other authors are based on uv lines , we consider our determination to be more accurate because it is almost independent of the adopted temperature while the abundance derived from the uv collisionally excited lines depends strongly on the adopted electron temperature ( although the recombination abundances are still regarded as controversial by other authors ) . the n / h value has been already amply discussed and most of the difference among the various groups depends on the use of @xmath34 or @xmath76 lines to determine the n abundance .",
    "most of the difference among the o and ne abundances is due to the adopted @xmath5 value .    to discuss the effect of stellar evolution on the observed abundances in ngc  5307 we present in table  [ tta ] the orion nebula and solar abundances as representative of the present day interstellar medium and of the interstellar medium at the time the sun was formed .",
    "table  [ tta ] presents the solar photospheric values for c ,",
    "n , o , ne , and ar , and the solar abundances derived from meteoritic data for s , cl , and fe . for the solar initial helium abundance the @xmath106 by @xcite was adopted , and not the photospheric one because , apparently , it has been affected by settling .",
    "notice that the solar oxygen abundance used in this paper is the average value of the recent results by @xcite and @xcite that indicate an o / h value of 8.71 dex , a value lower than that derived by @xcite .",
    "we are also using the c / h value by @xcite , the n / h and ne / h solar abundances were taken from @xcite , while the s / h , cl / h , and ar / h come from @xcite , the first two from the meteoritic data , while the last one from the photospheric data .",
    "the relative abundances of h , he , c , n , and o imply that ngc 5307 is a pn of type ii with a main sequence progenitor star in the 1.2 to 2.4 solar mass range @xcite .    in table",
    "[ tta ] we present the abundances of ngc 5307 , the orion nebula ( representative of the interstellar medium today ) , and the sun ( expected to be similar to the interstellar abundances when the parental star of ngc 5307 was formed ) . by comparing these abundances",
    "we reach the following conclusions : a ) the he abundance has not been significantly enriched by stellar evolution , b ) the c abundance has decreased by about a factor of three , and c ) the n abundance has increased by about a factor of three .",
    "these three results taken together indicate that the nebular material has only gone through part of the cno cycle , converting c into n , but without producing significant amounts of helium .",
    "evolutionary models of intermediate mass stars predict the n increase and the c decrease in their outer layers while the o and he abundances are almost unaffected ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; n increases at the expense of c because the c / n ratio in the interstellar medium and in the sun is considerably larger than the equilibrium value produced by the cno cycle ( e. g. * ? ? ?",
    "objects that show o - rich knots , like a30 and a58 , show he / h excesses that are not present in ngc 5307 @xcite .",
    "consequently the chemical composition of ngc 5307 is also against the presence of o - rich knots in this object",
    "ngc  5307 is a typical type ii pn with @xmath107 .",
    "its expansion velocity is low , about 15 km s@xmath18 .",
    "its chemical composition indicates that nuclear processing in the parental star of the ejected shell has not gone beyond the partial conversion of c into n. in particular it has a very similar he / h ratio to that present in the interstellar medium at the time its progenitor star formed    its chemical composition , together with the fwhm and the radial velocities of the lines and the [ ] lines , indicate that ngc 5307 does not have high density o - rich knots embedded in a low density o - normal medium .",
    "consequently the difference between the and [ ] line intensities has to be due to a different cause than chemical inhomogeneities .",
    "the comparison of the fwhm of the and [ ] lines provides an excellent method to detect the presence o - rich knots , with a high electron density and a high velocity relative to the parental star , embedded in a low density o - normal medium .    from the @xmath11(4649)/@xmath11(sum ) versus @xmath3(cl iii ) diagram we have found an equation that provides a good fit to most of the well observed gaseous nebulae .",
    "this fit to the data indicates that most , if not all , of the recombination lines intensity originates in the same regions than the [ ] collisional lines intensity , and that high density o - rich knots are not the main cause responsible , in these objects , for the presence of temperature variations .",
