    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) configurations of mesoscopic charged particles can be observed in various kinds of experiments @xcite , including colloidal suspensions confined to interfaces or between plates @xcite , or negatively charged dust particles levitating in the weakly ionized plasma sheath atop and parallel to a flat horizontal electrode @xcite .",
    "in coarse - grained descriptions one is interested in the charged particle s dynamics and phase behavior without taking explicit account of the surrounding electrons and ions that ensure overall charge - neutrality of the system . in this article , we employ mode - coupling theory ( mct ) to study vitrification in two kinds of confined , monodisperse charged - particle model systems .",
    "the first is the traditional two - parametric model of confined particles that interact via screened coulomb ( yukawa ) pair - potentials , and the second is a more realistic , three - parametric model for a monolayer of negatively charged particles embedded in a flowing plasma .",
    "the simple yukawa model has been widely used in the description of dusty plasmas ( see refs .",
    "it is capable of describing the effective pair - potential between charged particles rather accurately around the most common ( mean geometric ) nearest neighbor distance @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the yukawa model is not justified in many of the common laboratory experiments with 2d confinement , due to a highly anisotropic distribution of ions . in the common case of dusty plasmas , levitating in a collisional plasma sheath atop an electrode in a radio frequency chamber @xcite",
    ", account has to be taken of the plasma current of ions towards the electrode and the corresponding anisotropic effective dust interaction potentials .",
    "a kinetic theory of the ion distributions and effective dust grain interactions is appropriate in this case , and has been studied by different groups of researchers , under different assumptions on the plasma parameters @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on the solution of the kinetic equation for ions moving in the electrostatic field of the sheath .",
    "different approximations used for the ion collision operator ( describing the interaction with neutral gas ) merely reflect different experimental regimes ( in terms of the radio frequency discharge power and pressure ) when the particular model is applicable .    among these kinetic models , the one published by kompaneets _",
    "@xcite is based on a reasonable assumption of a mobility - limited ion drift in the sheath field ( as opposed to rather unrealistic inertia - limited motion ) and employs a velocity - independent ion - neutral collisional cross - section which is logarithmically accurate for the dominant charge - exchange collisions @xcite .",
    "the resulting three - parametric potential is anisotropic in three dimensions ( 3d ) ; for charged particles confined to 2d , it exhibits an algebraically long - ranged @xmath0 decay .",
    "this model is expected to provide a realistic description of interactions in ground - based dusty plasma laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "our results , reported in the present paper , predict qualitatively similar liquid - glass transition curves for monolayers with yukawa - like and kompaneets - like pair potentials .",
    "however , we find that a glass transition in a dusty plasma monolayer may be qualitatively misinterpreted if yukawa - like interactions are assumed : an apparently re - entrant liquid - glass - liquid state sequence is found in the parameter space of the yukawa potentials that at distances close to the mean geometric distance best fit the potential derived from the kinetic theory .",
    "this apparent re - entrant state sequence is merely an artifact that arises when one attempts to describe the system in terms of the inappropriate yukawa potential parameters , and it disappears when the more realistic kinetic potentials are assumed , and the corresponding dimensionless parameters are used in plotting the transition diagram .",
