    "for the last forty years there have been attempts to realize a correspondence between gauge theories with large number of colors and string theory . the most convincing duality of this kind was formulated relatively recently , when maldacena conjectured the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "many compelling results originating from the duality between type - iib superstring theory on @xmath2 and @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills theory  @xcite established this field as a major research area .",
    "one of the results of this duality is the relation between planar correlation functions of single - trace conformal primary operators in the boundary gauge theory and correlators of corresponding closed - string vertex operators on a worldsheet with the topology of @xmath4 .",
    "let us start with the study of a correlation function with two heavy vertex operators ( with large quantum numbers , proportional to the string tension ) and a number of `` light '' vertex operators ( with quantum numbers and dimensions close to one ) .",
    "then the large @xmath5 behavior of correlators of such operators is determined by a semiclassical string trajectory governed by the heavy operator insertions , while light vertex operators play the role of sources . to be more precise ,",
    "first we find the classical string solution that determines the leading contribution to the two - point function of the heavy operators .",
    "then we calculate the complete correlator by evaluating the light vertex operators on this trajectory .",
    "the above semiclassical considerations were utilized for the calculation of two - point functions in @xcite@xcite .",
    "an extension of this method to certain three - point correlators was discussed in @xcite , and elaborated in @xcite , where the heavy operators corresponded to a semiclassical string state with large r - charge and the light operator represented a bps state ",
    "massless ( supergravity ) scalar or dilaton mode . a more refined approach based on vertex operator insertions",
    "was put forward in @xcite .",
    "further studies can be found in  @xcite@xcite . at present",
    "the main efforts of the researchers worldwide are concentrated on the calculation of three - point functions of three heavy operators @xcite@xcite .",
    "parallel to these advances , an extension to four - point correlators was initiated in @xcite and various correlation functions were computed .",
    "furthermore , comparison with results from the gauge theory side was provided .",
    "motivated by these studies , in the present paper we examine the leading in @xmath5 contributions to particular four - point functions of four heavy bmn operators from the point of view of string theory in @xmath6 .",
    "the correlators can be represented by an exchange diagram involving a chiral primary operator ( cpo ) .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "is devoted to a brief overview of the method for evaluating @xmath0-point correlation functions with vertex operators . in sec .",
    "3 we proceed with the calculation of a leading contribution to four - point correlators of four bmn operators .",
    "we briefly discuss the results in the conclusion .",
    "first we will review the case of two - point correlators . in the leading semiclassical approximation",
    "they are determined by the corresponding classical string solution @xcite@xcite .",
    "if @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the two heavy vertex operators inserted at points @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the worldsheet , the two - point function for large string tension ( @xmath11 ) is given by the stationary point of the action @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the action of the @xmath6 string sigma model in the embedding coordinates @xmath14 we will impose conformal gauge and assume that the worldsheet is endowed with euclidean signature .",
    "the 2d derivatives have the following form @xmath15 .",
    "the relation between the embedding coordinates , and the global and poincar coordinates of @xmath16 that we will use below is @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "however , our approach necessitates the use of the euclidean continuation of @xmath16 @xmath19 so that @xmath20 .",
    "the stationary - point solution solves the string equations of motion with singular sources provided by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . making use of the conformal symmetry of the theory ,",
    "it is possible to map the @xmath21-plane to the euclidean cylinder parameterized by @xmath22 @xmath23 this conformal map transforms the singular solution on the @xmath21-plane to a smooth string solution @xcite .",
    "the new solution has the same quantum numbers as the vertex - operator states , guaranteeing that no information is lost .",
    "the above considerations can be reformulated for a physical integrated vertex operator labeled by a point @xmath24 on the boundary of @xmath16 @xcite @xmath25 the two - point function @xmath26 is determined in a similar fashion by the classical action evaluated on the stationary point solution . after applying the conformal map to the cylinder   we obtain a smooth solution that is actually the corresponding solitonic string solution in terms of poincar coordinates which satisfies the boundary conditions  @xcite @xmath27    as was shown in @xcite , the semiclassical three - point correlators with two heavy and one light operators are of the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the integral over @xmath30 . in the stationary point equations",
    "the contribution of the light operator can be neglected , so that the solution coincides with the one in the case of the two - point function of the two heavy operators .",
    "thus we get @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for the corresponding string solution with the same quantum numbers as the heavy vertex operators , transformed to the @xmath21-plane by . taking account of the fact that @xmath33",
    ", we can also represent in terms of the cylinder @xmath34    the global conformal @xmath35 symmetry fixes the two- and three - point correlation functions ( assuming that @xmath36 ) @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the scaling dimensions of the operators .",
    "if we choose in a convenient way @xmath39 , the dependence on @xmath40 in can be removed .",
    "then allows to compute the structure constants @xmath41  @xcite . presuming that @xmath42",
    ", we find after setting @xmath43 in that @xmath44    the leading contribution to the four - point functions of two heavy and two light operators is provided by @xmath45 the semiclassical trajectory being the same , @xmath46 is determined by the product of the light operators on the solution @xmath47 transforming to the @xmath22-coordinates we get @xmath48",
    "in this section we will consider particular constrained contributions to four - point correlators of four heavy bmn operators corresponding to the string solution in @xcite for generic positions of the heavy operator insertions .",
    "the correlation function can be thought of as two two - point correlators connected with a light bulk - to - bulk propagator ( see fig . [ 4pheavy ] ) . to obtain the full correlation functions we need to sum over all intermediate supergravity states .",
    "we will follow the spirit of the calculations presented in @xcite .",

    "the two - point function of such operators can be calculated as @xcite @xmath59 in order to obtain a contribution to the four - point correlator we need to `` join '' two two - point functions with a light state , which we choose to be the chiral primary operator .",

    "the ratio @xmath79 does not look conformally invariant , but if we account for the constraints @xmath50 and @xmath51 imposed on the positions of operators , we will see that @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not only invariant under translations , rotations and dilations , but also under inversion , which guarantees their conformal invariance . the existence of only one ratio ( instead of two ) follows from the constrained nature of operator positions .",
    "the duality between gauge and string theories passed through many crucial developments over the last years . the ads / cft correspondence has achieved impressive results about the anomalous dimensions of gauge theory operators , integrable structures , etc . , and various properties of gauge theories at strong coupling have been established .",
    "one of the main challenges ahead is to find efficient methods for calculation of correlation functions .",
    "although the three - point correlator of three heavy operators is not yet fully understood  @xcite@xcite , we have discovered a lot about the behavior of correlation functions containing two heavy and one light states at strong coupling @xcite .",
    "using the trajectory for the correlator of two heavy operators @xcite , the authors of @xcite put forward an approach based on insertion of vertex operators .",
    "the same method applies also to higher @xmath0-point correlation functions with two heavy and @xmath81 light operators .    in the present paper we consider",
    "string theory on @xmath6 and compute specific leading contributions to four - point functions at strong coupling , applying the ideas of @xcite for calculation of correlators with vertex operators .",
    "we examine the method in the case of four heavy bmn states .",
    "there has been also development in the computation of three- and four - point correlation functions with heavy operators via integrability techniques @xcite@xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to see if our results can be obtained in such a way from the gauge theory point of view .",
    "the authors would like to thank h. dimov for valuable discussions and careful reading of the paper .",
