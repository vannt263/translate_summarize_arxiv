    "over the last decade , many systems of luminous star clusters have been discovered in merging and merger remnant galaxies ( lutz 1991 ; holtzmann et al .",
    "1992 ; see also schweizer 1998 for a review ) .",
    "many of these appear to be globular clusters based on their compactness ( small effective radius ) .",
    "they are thought to be young systems ( @xmath11  gyr ) on the basis of their blue broadband colours and high luminosities .",
    "the low ages support the view that they formed during the past merger .",
    "the typical duration of the merger - induced star formation episode is about a few hundred million years @xcite .",
    "these newly formed globular clusters provide the opportunity to study the process of globular cluster formation , and the early phases of the evolution of their stellar populations .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "a stellar population aging to @xmath12@xmath13  myr ( intermediate - age range ) abruptly develops a well populated asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and consequently displays very red colours .",
    "when the age exceeds @xmath14  gyr , the contribution of agb stars sharply decreases .",
    "this very short epoch is referred to as the agb phase - transition ( renzini 1981 ) .",
    "the observational counterpart of this theoretical prediction is represented by the intermediate - age gcs in the magellanic clouds , which span a large range in v@xmath3k ( from  @xmath14 to @xmath15 mag ) , as a consequence of the agb phase - transition ( see e.g. persson et al .",
    "1983 , frogel , mould & blanco 1990 ) .",
    "the magellanic clouds are the only sites in which the agb phase transition has been observed so far .",
    "recent mergers are the natural places to further investigate the occurrence of such a phenomenon .",
    "the galaxy ngc 7252 is a prototypical remnant of two merged disk - like galaxies ( fritze - v alvensleben & gerhard 1994a , b ; schweizer 1998 ) , containing very bright young globular clusters ( schweizer 1982 ; whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ) . a deep optical photometric study with _",
    "hst _ was carried out by miller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who conveniently divided the star clusters of ngc 7252 into two populations .",
    "the `` outer '' population contains objects with projected galactocentric distances between 6  and @xmath2 120 , the `` inner '' population contains objects within 6  of the nucleus . by analyzing the object colours and using a reddening - free parameter , miller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) conclude that the inner sample mainly consists of very young ob associations , while the outer sample is composed by bright blue ( young ) globular clusters and by fainter reddish ( old ) globular clusters .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) performed a spectroscopic study of a sub - sample of globular clusters belonging to the outer blue population .",
    "ages for these clusters were determined via comparison of the strong observed balmer lines with various sets of models , and found to be in the narrow range @xmath16@xmath17  myr .",
    "the ages determined from @xmath18 optical photometry were found to be 20 % smaller than the spectroscopic ones .",
    "if the outer blue population of ngc 7252 contains intermediate - age clusters , the evidence for agb phase transition is expected among these clusters . with this in mind , we obtained @xmath0 magnitudes for a sample of globular clusters belonging to the outer blue sample .",
    "the @xmath0 photometry , not included in previous studies , was motivated by the fact that agb stars mainly emit in the infrared ( see e.g. persson et al .",
    "complementing with published optical photometry , we analyze the data in the two - colour diagram v@xmath3k vs. b@xmath3v , using simple stellar population models _ calibrated _ with the intermediate - age star clusters in magellanic clouds ( maraston 1998 ) .",
    "the spectroscopy by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) is used here to further constrain the cluster metallicities , and to investigate the element abundances .",
    "the galaxy ngc 7252 is the only remnant so far to have been modelled in detail using @xmath19-body simulations ( fritze - v alvensleben & gerhard 1994b ; hibbard & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "the derived age distribution of our cluster sample can therefore be compared with the predictions of these simulations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 describes the observations and the data reduction .",
    "the index measurements on published spectroscopy are also presented here .",
    "the modelling of intermediate ages ssps is presented in section  3 . in section 4 , we discuss the photometric ages for individual clusters and the comparison with the spectroscopically - derived values , while section  5 deals with metallicities and abundance ratios for the star clusters and the diffuse galaxy light .",
    "results are discussed in section  6 and conclusions are drawn in section  7 .",
    "the @xmath0-band data were obtained with the near - infrared camera ( nirc , matthews & soifer 1994 ) on the keck i telescope on the night of june 20 , 1999 .",
    "the camera operates with a 256 @xmath20 256 pixels insb detector , with a pixel size of 30@xmath21 m corresponding to 0.15  on the sky .",
    "the total field of view is 38@xmath20 38 .",
    "we used a @xmath22 filter for all observations ( see persson et al .",
    "1998 for the transmission curve ) .",
    "we tested various flatfields and finally used one computed from a number of random sky observations done shortly before observing ngc 7252 .",
    "these were dark subtracted , averaged using a sigma clipping algorithm and normalized .",
    "the flatfield was then applied to all science and calibration data .",
    "two adjacent , slightly overlapping , fields were centered on ngc 7252 .",
    "the east - west coverage is @xmath23 70 , the north - south coverage is 38 .",
    "the observations were carried out in 300s blocks : each block was split into 100s ( 5 coadds of 20s ) on the east field , 100s ( 5 coadds of 20s ) on the west field , and 100s on the sky ( 250  north ) , the latter being divided into 5 dithered exposures ( 5 coadds of 4s each ) .",
    "these 5 sky exposures were averaged with a sigma clipping algorithm to create a blank sky field .",
    "this sky field ( of 20s effective exposure time ) was normalized to 100s effective exposure time and subtracted from both the east and the west field of the same block .",
    "the individual images of the east and the west field , obtained this way , were then respectively averaged to compute the final images .",
    "the total integration time on each ngc 7252 field was 1300s .",
    "the seeing on the final images , as measured from the fwhm of the objects , was around 0.5 . a composite image of both fields in shown in fig.[image7252 ] .",
    "seven standards from persson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) were observed throughout the night .",
    "most standards were observed more than once at different airmasses . each standard observation is composed of nine exposures ( 4 coadds of 1s ) in a box pattern .",
    "the resulting 144 standard measurements were used to derive a zero point and extinction coefficient ; the colour term was assumed to be negligible .",
    "we obtained the following relation : + @xmath24 , + where @xmath25 is the measured magnitude of an object ( normalized to 1s exposure ) and @xmath26 is the airmass .    in order to remove any steep background gradients and to perform the photometry on a homogeneous `` sky '' , we modelled the galaxy with a 31@xmath2031 pixels median filter and subtracted it from the original images .",
    "the photometry was performed on the galaxy - subtracted images with sextractor @xcite .",
    "the detection parameters were set to 5 adjacent pixels 1.5 @xmath27 over the local background ( as defined in a 32@xmath2032 pixels box ) .",
    "the photometry was computed in different apertures , and finally the `` automatic aperture magnitudes '' ( see bertin & arnouts 1996 ) were used for consistency with the standard star measurements .",
    "the k@xmath28 magnitudes were corrected for a galactic foreground extinction of @xmath29 ( for consistency with miller et al .",
    "1997 , see below ) , using the relation @xmath30 ( fitzpatrick 1999 )",
    ".    .k@xmath28 magnitudes of young star clusters in ngc 7252 .",
    "note that the magnitudes in this table are _ not _ corrected for galactic foreground extinction .",
    "the ( v@xmath3k ) colour , however , is corrected for a galactic foreground extinction of @xmath29 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the expected numbers of tp - agb stars are given in table [ stoflu ] .",
    "the tp - agb phase in our clusters is well populated , the faintest clusters ( w24 and and w19 ) having the smallest numbers of tp - agb stars .",
    "the expected stochastic fluctuations are given in the last two columns and range between 1 % and 13 % .",
    "the corresponding magnitude fluctuations are of the same order , therefore smaller or comparable to the observational errors ( see table 1 ) .",
    "a remarkable consistency is evident between the star counts obtained using the @xmath31 and the @xmath0 luminosities .",
    "this is not surprising because our ssps are able to simultaneously reproduce the optical and ir colours very well , for @xmath32 .",
    "note that the expected numbers of stars are not significantly affected by changing the metallicity , because the specific evolutionary flux remains almost unchanged ( see renzini 1998 ; maraston 2000 ) and the main driver is the large luminosities of the clusters .",
    "the direct determination of cluster metallicities by measuring the strength of metallic lines ( e.g. mg , fe , etc . ) is complicated by two effects .",
    "the artificial broadening of the observed spectra , required in order to compare with the model ones , undesirably dilutes the metallic lines which are typically weak in the spectra of young stellar populations .",
    "this is aggravated by the low signal - to - noise of most of the spectra ( see table  3 and discussion in schweizer & seitzer 1998 ) .",
    "for these reasons we restrict the measurement of metallic lines to the best observed object , w3 .",
    "we extend the exercise to objects w6 and w30 , cautioning that these spectra are of much lower quality .",
    "the equivalent widths of mgb and fe5270 are measured on the observed - broadened and model spectra .",
    "the comparison is made by measuring the indices on observed and model spectra exactly in the same way ( see sec .",
    "2.5 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we adopt the definitions of line and continuum bandpasses given in worthey et al .",
    "it is important to note that these model indices are not computed by means of the fitting functions given in worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "[ metal ] shows the synthetic ews of fe5270 ( bottom panel ) and mgb ( top panel ) for ssps with various metallicities , as functions of age .",
    "the measured values for objects w3 , w6 and w30 ( symbols ) are plotted versus the photometric ages given in table 4 ( see below ) .",
    "the vertical error bars are derived from the flux calibrated spectra by scaling our measurements errors to our measured h@xmath33 errors , which in turn are matched to the h@xmath33 errors given in schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) ( see table 3 ) .",
    "we now comment on the individual clusters .",
    "an excellent agreement is found for object w3 between the measured ews ( fe5270 @xmath34   , mgb @xmath35   ) and the ssp with @xmath36 , using the photometric age derived from this same model ( @xmath37 myr ) .",
    "by contrast , the photometric ages inferred from the @xmath38 and the @xmath39 models correspond to ews larger than the observed ones for both lines .",
    "the consistency between the results from photometry and spectroscopy indicates that w3 is a @xmath37  myr old , @xmath40 metallicity object with high likelihood . note",
    "that measuring the mgb and fe ews on the original , higher resolution spectrum gives fe5270 @xmath41    and mgb @xmath42  respectively , consistent with the values measured on the broadened spectrum .    in the case of object w6 ( fe5270 @xmath43    and mgb @xmath44   ) , the best agreement is found when the average photometric age derived from the @xmath38 model is adopted .",
    "the other two metallicities agree less well .",
    "finally , we obtain fe5270 @xmath45    and mgb @xmath46  for object w30 .",
    "these values do not allow us to clearly discriminate between half - solar and solar metallicity for this cluster ( the former being slightly preferred ) , but metallicities much above solar appear to be ruled out .",
    "object w6 appears to be slightly more metal - rich than object w3 .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with the findings of schweitzer & seitzer ( 1998 ) , although they derive larger metallicities for both clusters .",
    "this may be due to the use by schweitzer & seitzer ( 1998 ) of model lick indices based on the analytical fitting functions given in worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . as also noted by these authors ,",
    "these functions are designed for old stellar populations , and it is not clear how well these can be applied to younger stellar populations .",
    "the abundance ratios of @xmath10-elements to iron - group elements carry information on the timescales over which star formation occurs , because @xmath10-elements ( e.g. , mg , o , etc . ) are produced in type ii supernovae ( short - lived progenitors ) , while a significant fraction of iron comes from type ia supernovae ( long - lived progenitors ) .",
    "a solar mg / fe implies star formation timescales of the order 10  gyr , while [ mg / fe]@xmath47 dex requires formation timescales @xmath14  gyr ( e.g. , thomas , greggio , & bender 1999 ) .",
    "if the observed mg line - strength is stronger than predicted by ssp models based on solar abundance ratios , an enhancement of @xmath10-elements is likely to exist , as is the case for luminous elliptical galaxies ( see section 6.3 ) .    from fig .",
    "[ metal ] it appears that object w3 is not overabundant in @xmath10-elements .",
    "this is what it is expected if the clusters form out of the highly fe - enriched interstellar gas of the progenitor spirals ( thomas , greggio , & bender 1999 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the prediction by fritze - v alvensleben & gerhard ( 1994a ) , that any star clusters formed during mergers should have abundance ratios typical of the interstellar medium in the progenitor spirals .",
    "if the young globular clusters form out of the interstellar medium associated with the merger event , it is interesting to investigate how the overall galaxy spectrum compares with the ones of the newly formed clusters .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse light is produced by a mixture of stellar populations of various ages and metallicities , the light being dominated by the last episode of star formation .",
    "the interpretation by means of ssp models gives , by definition , only a measure of the average population mix .",
    "this analysis is nonetheless useful in order to identify the possible presence of features strikingly different from the cluster spectra .",
    "f. schweizer kindly provided us with the spectrum of the central region of ngc 7252 ( fig .",
    "[ spegal ] ) .",
    "the spectrum was taken in 1982 with the las campanas [ du pont ] 2.5-meter telescope , equipped with shectman s reticon .",
    "the aperture was 2``x 2 '' , centered on the nucleus , and the integration was 2000 sec , with a high dispersion ( 1200 l / mm ) grating .",
    "this spectrum has been broadened ( see section 2.5 ) and the balmer lines plus some metallic lines have been measured , using the same bandpass definitions as for the cluster spectra . for the additional metallic lines fe5335 and mg@xmath48 used here , the index definitions given in worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) are adopted . in the case of the ngc 7252 nuclear spectrum ,",
    "mg@xmath48 is preferred to mgb because the continuum of the latter can be increased by continuum hydrogen emission , common in young regions .",
    "this would produce an artificially deep mgb line , because the continuum of the mgb feature is defined to be adjacent to the line itself .",
    "mg@xmath48 should suffer less from this effect because its continuum bandpasses are far enough from the absorption line .",
    "the following values are obtained for the nuclear spectrum : h@xmath49 @xmath50   , h@xmath51 @xmath52   , h@xmath33 @xmath53   , mg@xmath48 @xmath54   , fe5270 @xmath55    and fe5335  @xmath56   .    in fig",
    ".  [ linegal ] these values ( marked as straight lines ) are compared to the predictions of ssps with various metallicities , plotted as functions of age .",
    "shaded areas represent errors .",
    "the strengths of @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( left - hand panels ) consistently suggest an age of : @xmath59  myr for metallicity @xmath40 ; @xmath60  myr for solar metallicity ; @xmath61  myr for metallicity @xmath39 .",
    "the slightly larger ages inferred from @xmath62 are because its value is lowered by filling from an emission line ( clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ spegal ] ) .",
    "the strengths of the metallic lines ( right - hand panels ) also consistently constrain the age , which is , however , systematically lower than the one obtained from the balmer lines , for every metallicity . the following value",
    "are found : @xmath63  myr for metallicity @xmath40 ; @xmath64  myr for solar metallicity ; @xmath65  myr for metallicity @xmath39 .",
    "the smallest discrepancy amounts to 28 % for the @xmath40 model ; within the error bars the ages from balmer lines and from metallic lines are consistent for the @xmath40 model .    on average , the spectral features of the galaxy central diffuse light are consistent with a rather young average population with metallicity slightly sub - solar , in agreement with what is derived from the analysis of the star clusters . as in the case of the star clusters ,",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse light does not show an enhancement in @xmath10-elements .",
    "simulations of the chemical evolution of composite stellar populations where a young component is born on top of an underlying old population during a spiral  spiral merger ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) are in agreement with this result , in the sense that no @xmath10-enhancement is observed in the resulting composite population .    note that our results disfavour an imf substantially flatter than salpeter for the stars formed during the merger .",
    "a flat imf would imply a larger number of sn ii and fast enrichment of the gas in @xmath10-elements .",
    "therefore we would expect the newly formed stellar populations to be @xmath10-enhanced ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) .",
    "the derived ages and the age spread are compared with different models in order to constrain the nature of the progenitors and derive the star formation history during the merger event .",
    "the ages derived for the observed young clusters confirm the small spread in age reported by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) , see fig.[agehisto ] . using different ssp models ,",
    "we infer slightly lower cluster ages , ranging between 300 and 500 myr .",
    "we confirm that cluster s114 for which schweizer & seitzer could not conclude an age , does indeed fall in the same age range as the other clusters ( @xmath66   ",
    "@xmath67  myr old , depending on the metallicity ) .",
    "as previously pointed out by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) , the ages are in reasonable agreement with predictions from n - body simulations for ngc 7252 for the star formation during a disk - disk merger ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) which predict ( for @xmath68 km s@xmath69  mpc @xmath69 ) that the first pericenter contact happened @xmath70  myr ago , the major burst of star formation occurring @xmath71  myr years after this encounter , lasting @xmath72  myr .",
    "we note that the predictions for star formation during the merger of bulge dominated disks differ from the predictions for a disk  disk encounter ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) . in bulge",
    "dominated mergers , galaxies appear stabilized against bar modes which tend to delay the gas inflow : star formation is predicted to happen @xmath73  myr after the close encounter and to be more violent but of shorter duration . in fig .",
    "[ agehisto ] ( cf .",
    "mihos & hernquist s fig .  5 )",
    "we show a histogram of the clusters ages ( as derived from photometry for @xmath74 ) together with the predictions for a disk  disk merger and a bulge dominated merger .",
    "the beginning of the star formation does match either case : it starts slightly later as expected for a disk - disk merger , but slightly earlier than expected in a bulge dominated merger ( although the timescale of the simulation can be rescaled by the distance to ngc 7252 and the mass of the progenitors ) .",
    "the duration of the star formation ( taken as the dispersion of our ages @xmath75 1 gyr ) is around @xmath76  myr , closer to the prediction for a bulge dominated merger . with respect to the simulations , we can not strongly conclude whether the progenitors of ngc 7252 were bulge dominated or not , but see evidence that they were not pure disks .",
    "fritze - von alvensleben & gerhard ( 1994b ) studied the integrated properties of the stellar light and reached the conclusion that ngc 7252 is best modelled by the merger of two massive sc type spirals .",
    "further , their study suggests that star formation took place 1.3 to 2 gyr ago , well before the time of the first pericenter contact , namely @xmath77@xmath78  gyr ( borne & richstone 1991 ) .",
    "these conclusions are in agreement with our observations .",
    "one cluster ( w32 ) stands out in colour as older than the others .",
    "unfortunately , no spectroscopy is available for it .    at face value , from the combination of its optical and near - infrared colours and our plotted ssps , w32 appears to be a cluster with an age in the range 1 to 2 gyr rather than being an old ( @xmath79  gyr ) cluster belonging to the progenitors spirals .",
    "however , its optical colours ( b@xmath3v@xmath80 , v@xmath3i@xmath81 ) could , according to ssp models , still be compatible with a metal - poor , old ( 12 to 15 gyr ) cluster .",
    "for example , maraston ( 1998 ) models for z@xmath82 , 15 gyr , gould et al .",
    "( 1997 ) imf predict b@xmath3v@xmath83 , v@xmath3i@xmath84 . in this case , the corresponding v@xmath3k should be @xmath85 , instead of @xmath86 . adding the near infrared colour therefore seems to exclude an old ( @xmath87@xmath88  gyr ) age .",
    "if w32 had an age of 15 gyr its total luminosity , for a distance modulus of @xmath89 ( assuming @xmath68 km s@xmath69 mpc @xmath69 ) , would be @xmath90 mag which is one to two magnitudes brighter than the brightest globular clusters in the milky way and m31 .",
    "there is no obvious reason for an abnormal m / l@xmath91 which could translate the high luminosity into a normal mass ( see section 6.2 ) .",
    "we conclude that w32 is likely to be a cluster in the age range 1 to 2 gyr , and must have formed before the first pericenter contact of the two merging galaxies .",
    "finally , we checked whether w32 is an exception by verifying if our observed sub - sample is biased with respect to the total sample of miller et al .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test returns a probability of @xmath2 90% that both samples are drawn from the same population .",
    "miller et al.s is assumed to be unbiased with respect to object colour in the range of interest , so that one could expect a few more clusters with similar ages to w32 .",
    "interestingly the young clusters , as already discussed by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) , appear too bright by one to two magnitudes , compared to massive globular clusters , for the assumed distance .",
    "could the distance to ngc 7252 have been overestimated ?",
    "the systemic velocity of @xmath92 km s@xmath69 for ngc 7252 was measured by schweizer ( 1982 ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the mean heliocentric velocity of 5083 km s@xmath69 and velocity dispersion of about 430 km s@xmath69 of the ngc7284/85 group , to which ngc 7252 belongs . using the latest flow field model by the key project ( mould et al .",
    "2000 ) , this translates into a distance around 68 mpc ( assuming @xmath68 km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 ) , or @xmath93 .",
    "it is therefore excluded that the distance to ngc 7252 has been significantly overestimated . note that assuming @xmath94",
    "km s@xmath69 mpc@xmath69 would aggravate the problem .",
    "thus the young clusters in ngc 7252 _ are _ exceptionally luminous .",
    "the three brightest objects w3 , w6 and w30 have @xmath95 , respectively ( for @xmath96 km s@xmath69 mpc @xmath69 and a distance modulus @xmath97=34.04 , schweizer & seitzer 1998 ) .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the cluster masses @xmath98=@xmath99 , adopting a model mass - to - light ratio . in order to compare with present day , @xmath2 15 gyr",
    "old globular clusters , the fading of the young clusters due to aging has to be considered .",
    "we concentrate on object w3 , which is the most luminous cluster .",
    "our synthetic stellar mass - to - light ratios take into account the contribution from stellar remnants , as described by maraston ( 1998 , see also maraston 1999 ) .",
    "the photometric age for object w3 is @xmath100  myr ( for @xmath32 , see table 4 ) .",
    "the corresponding mass - to - light ratio in @xmath31 for a salpeter imf is @xmath101 , which translates in a present mass for w3 @xmath102 , a factor of @xmath103 lower than the value estimated by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the difference most likely results from schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) assigning an age of @xmath73  myr and a solar metallicity to w3 .",
    "both the older age and the larger metallicity increases the @xmath105 and hence the estimated mass .",
    "part of the difference comes from the use of a model @xmath105 ( bruzual & charlot 1996 in schweizer & seitzer 1998 ) , in which stellar mass loss is not taken into account .    to explore the extent to which the mass can be lowered by changing the imf , we additionally consider two cases",
    "the first is a giant - dominated imf with exponent @xmath106 ( in the notation in which salpeter is @xmath107 ) . as already mentioned in section 4.2 , the age for w3 changes to @xmath108  myr , corresponding to @xmath109 , hence a mass @xmath110",
    "this is lower by @xmath2 32 % than the one derived for the salpeter case .",
    "the second option is an imf which is flattened at the low - mass end .",
    "we consider the one suggested by gould , bachall & flynn ( 1997 ) , based on _ hst _ observations of disk @xmath98 dwarfs .",
    "the shape of this imf is @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath107 for @xmath115 ( in the notation in which salpeter is @xmath107 ) .",
    "the derived age for w3 is @xmath37  myr , as in the salpeter case , because the effect on colours is negligible .",
    "the corresponding mass - to - light is @xmath116 , hence the present mass for w3 is @xmath117 .",
    "this is lower than the mass for the model with a salpeter imf by 45 % .",
    "at an age of 15 gyr , w3 will have a mass @xmath118 for the salpeter case ( @xmath119 ) , @xmath120 for the gould et al .",
    "case ( @xmath121 ) and @xmath122 for the giant - dominated imf ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "note that the large mass - to - light ratios for the giant - dominated imf are due to the larger number of massive stellar remnants ( see figs .",
    "16 - 17 in maraston 1998 ) .",
    "taking also into account evaporation , the mass can be decreased by an additional 1% ( binney & tremaine 1987 )",
    ".    therefore the mass of the evolved w3 cluster will be at least  @xmath2 10 times larger than the mass of @xmath124 cen ( @xmath125 , harris 1996 ) , which is the most massive cluster of the milky way . as already suggested by schweizer & seitzer ( 1998 ) , a dynamical estimate of the mass of w3 , independent of population synthesis ,",
    "is required to confirm these estimates .",
    "this is the subject of an ongoing project .      in the framework of hierarchical structure formation models ( white & rees 1978 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et al . 1994 ) ,",
    "elliptical galaxies are built up by merging disk systems .",
    "it is therefore interesting to know whether a merger - remnant like ngc 7252 will evolve into an object similar to a present day elliptical .",
    "a strong argument favouring this evolution is the observed light distribution in the inner part of ngc 7252 , which closely resembles the @xmath126 de vaucoulers light profile of elliptical galaxies ( schweizer 1982 ) . in spite of the fact that it is a recent merger ,",
    "ngc 7252 already shows no sign of any major stellar disk component in its inner part .",
    "the colours of ngc 7252 will be close to the observed range of normal ellipticals after a time of 1 to 4 gyr from the present , depending on when the star formation ceases ( fritze - von alvensleben & gerhard 1994b ) .",
    "yet there are two pieces of evidence against the evolution of ngc 7252 to a bona fide elliptical .",
    "elliptical galaxies have @xmath10-enhanced average stellar populations ( worthey et al .",
    "this is found for ellipticals in dense environments ( mehlert et al . 2000 ; kuntschner 2000 ) and in the field ( gonzlez 1993 ; trager et al .",
    "2000 ; beuing , mendes de oliveira & bender 2000 ) .",
    "due to its very isolated position , ngc 7252 would become a field elliptical , likely an @xmath127 object . in section 5",
    "we showed that neither the cluster population nor the diffuse light of ngc 7252 show any sign of overabundance in @xmath10-elements .",
    "therefore , the present average stellar population of ngc 7252 can not evolve into an average @xmath10-enhanced stellar population , in contrast to the observations of present day ellipticals of the same luminosity .",
    "note that abundance ratios provide a stronger constraint than colours because the latter can become sufficiently red if enough time for passive evolution is allowed after star formation stops .",
    "the abundance ratios of fe and mg instead are fixed when star formation stops and they can not further change with passive evolution . note that the convective mixing ( dredge - up ) during the red - giant phase does not alter the surface [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio , because these elements are not synthetized in the interiors and therefore not dredged - up ( see e.g. renzini & voli 1981 ) .",
    "another complication is the number of metal - rich globular clusters normalized to the galaxy light .",
    "it requires that a large number of new globular clusters have to form during the merger process ( e.g.  forbes , brodie & grillmair 1997 , kissler - patig et al .",
    "we see from this work and from the work of others mentioned in the introduction that new globulars indeed form during a merger - induced starburst .",
    "it is not , however , clear whether the number of new clusters is sufficient to be compatible with the number of red clusters observed in elliptical galaxies ( see e.g. harris 2000 for a review ) . as the efficiency in cluster production obviously increases with the gas content of the mergers ( e.g. kissler - patig , forbes & minniti 1998 ) , gas - rich mergers are better candidates .",
    "gas - rich mergers , on the other hand do not produce @xmath10-enhanced stellar populations , as discussed above .",
    "furthermore the very young ages of the newly formed clusters ( section 4 ) imply a large age difference compared to the old cluster population belonging to the progenitor spirals . while a large number of studies have discovered bimodal gc colour and metallicity distributions of globular clusters in more than half of the early - type galaxies studied ( zepf & ashman 1993 ; gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ) , spectroscopic and photometric investigations indicate that both populations are old ( cohen et al .",
    "1998 ; kissler - patig et al .",
    "1998 ; kissler - patig , forbes & minniti 1998 ; kundu et al .",
    "1999 ; puzia et al .",
    "ellipticals with gcs populations that are well - separated ( @xmath128 8 gyr ) in age seem to be rare .",
    "ngc 7252 will therefore remain an abnormal object for the present epoch even if , after the merger , it resembles an elliptical in several respects .",
    "recent studies have shown evidence for a population of bright , young star clusters in the merger remnant ngc 7252 in which the agb phase transition should be detectable . with this aim we obtained @xmath0 photometry for these clusters .",
    "this is a new approach , previous investigations have been confined to optical bands . indeed , in intermediate - age populations ( @xmath129  gyr ) the agb phase is the major contributor to the total energy . to analyze the data we used models for simple stellar populations in which the contribution of the agb phase to the total light is calibrated on the intermediate - age globular clusters of the magellanic clouds .",
    "*   the v@xmath3k vs. b@xmath3v diagram predicted by our models describes the observed colours remarkably well and clearly shows the ongoing agb phase transition among these clusters .",
    "this is the first detection of the agb phase transition outside the local group . *",
    "the photometric ages derived from b@xmath3v and v@xmath3k are in excellent agreement and are consistent with a metallicity @xmath6@xmath7 for the studied clusters .",
    "*   most of the clusters appear to be @xmath4@xmath5  myr old , consistent with previous age determinations based on optical spectroscopy .",
    "*   one cluster ( object w32 ) stands out as being @xmath130@xmath9  gyr old .",
    "if this object belongs to the same family of star clusters produced during the merger , then it must have formed before the first pericentral contact and cluster ( and star ) formation in a gas - rich disk - disk merger lasted at least @xmath131@xmath9  gyr .",
    "*   we further analyze the spectral features of the best observed cluster w3 and of the diffuse light of the nucleus of ngc 7252 , using spectroscopy from the literature ( schweizer & seitzer 1998 ; f. schweizer , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "as expected from simulations of the chemical evolution of merging spirals ( thomas , greggio & bender 1999 ) , neither stars nor clusters show an overabundance in @xmath10-elements with respect to the iron group , in contrast to what is observed in elliptical galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "this suggests that a present day disk - disk merger like ngc 7252 does not evolve into a present day elliptical .",
    "our results disfavour an imf substantially flatter than salpeter during the merger - induced star formation , because this produces @xmath10-enhanced stellar populations .",
