    "the anisotropic a phase of superfluid @xmath0he exhibits unique behavior under externally applied superflow . instead of being quantized , the circulation of the superfluid velocity @xmath1 in @xmath0he - a can have any value depending on the spatial variation of the order - parameter texture",
    ". the decay of superflow can be accomplished by generating a nonuniform texture of the orbital vector @xmath2 , leading ultimately to the formation of continuous vortices ( with no singular core ) .",
    "however , energy considerations favor the uniform texture with constant @xmath2 for small velocities and postpone these processes until a certain critical velocity is exceeded . because of the macroscopic length scale of texture variations and the boundary condition that fixes the direction of @xmath2 at the walls , vortex formation is unaffected by extrinsic influences , such as surface roughness and thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore , in contrast to superfluid @xmath3he , critical velocity in @xmath0he - a is determined by an intrinsic instability of the flow .",
    "superflow of @xmath0he - a has been previously studied theoretically in many papers , see refs .   and for references .",

    "an initially constant texture becomes first modified in the freedericksz transition , where @xmath2 starts to tilt from the direction normal to the plates@xcite . on increasing the velocity further , the texture becomes unstable towards a helical deformation@xcite , which leads to formation of vortices .",
    "however , the main point in this paper is to study an initially inhomogeneous texture formed by a dipole - unlocked soliton@xcite .",
    "the flow through such a domain wall was first studied by vollhardt and maki@xcite using a variational ansatz .",
    "more recently the same problem was studied numerically in ref .   .",
    "we extend these one - dimensional calculations to include the effect of lateral walls in a flow channel .",
    "we investigate how the critical velocity in the presence of the soliton depends on the width @xmath4 of the flow channel .",
    "we find that the dependence is much stronger than for the helical instability in the absence of the soliton .",
    "the dipole - locked soliton is exceptionally interesting , because it forms the backbone of another topological object , the vortex sheet@xcite .",
    "our calculation can be used as a model for the critical velocity of the sheet , and it explains semi - quantitatively the measured dependence on the angular velocity@xcite .",
    "peculiar dynamical properties of the vortex sheet was observed in experiments@xcite . to provide additional information to explain this behavior ,",
    "we have also calculated numerically the nmr frequency shift which is the relevant experimental parameter .",

    "then the texture is changed towards the equilibrium distribution according to @xmath50 where the torques acting on the order - parameter vectors are defined as @xmath51 and the ( small ) iteration constants @xmath52 and @xmath53 are chosen so as to achieve fast convergence .",
    "also , after each iteration step the vectors are adjusted to have unit length and to satisfy the condition @xmath54 .",
    "the iteration process is repeated until the minimum of the free energy is reached ( signalled by the vanishing of the torques ) .",

    "the critical velocity @xmath61 of the flow instability is determined from the condition @xmath62",
    "before studying the soliton case , it is necessary to understand the flow response in the absence of the soliton .",
    "we begin by considering the simplest order - parameter structure in @xmath0he - a between parallel plates . for the case of zero velocity , @xmath63 ,",
    "the free energy is minimized by a uniform texture , where @xmath64 .",
    "this homogeneous configuration is a simultaneous minimum of @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , and also satisfies the requirement @xmath68 at the boundaries .",
    "next we introduce a flow in the system by a requirement @xmath69 in the presence of flow , @xmath2 tends to turn towards the flow direction because the component of the superfluid - density tensor along @xmath2 , @xmath23 , is smaller than the perpendicular one , @xmath24 .",
    "this would require the formation of an inhomogeneous texture , because at the surfaces of the plates @xmath70 is rigidly anchored perpendicular to the flow .",

    "the transition where @xmath2 starts to deflect from the plate normal @xmath74 is known as freedericksz transition , and @xmath75 denotes the corresponding velocity .",

    "the complicated order - parameter structure of @xmath0he - a allows for a variety of different topological defects .",

    "therefore , a flow velocity equal to @xmath87 can be achieved by requiring @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a diagonal matrix with elements 1 , -1 , and 1 .",
    "otherwise the numerical calculations follow the same procedure as in the case with a uniform initial texture .    in order to understand the response of the soliton wall to an external flow , it is advantageous to first study a simpler case in one dimension @xmath34 along the flow in the bulk .",

    "when the phase difference exceeds a critical value , the texture undergoes an abrupt rotation through a large angle , again leading to vortex creation somewhere on the sides .",
    "roughly the same scenario takes place also in the two - dimensional parallel - plate geometry , with some modifications .",
    "far away from the soliton plane and at the solid walls the texture is locked to a uniform @xmath116 configuration and can not rotate when the flow is applied .",

    "the calculation of the critical velocity for the soliton presents some problems because , due to the breakdown of translational invariance in the @xmath34 direction , the flow response of the system depends on the length @xmath36 of our computational region .",

    "there is counterflow through the vortex - free end pieces of the sheet , and the sheet can grow only when new vorticity is nucleated there .",
    "it is found experimentally that the critical velocity for the growth of the vortex sheet depends essentially on the angular velocity @xmath142 , increasing with increasing @xmath142@xcite .",
    "this can now be understood because the width of the vortex - free soliton pieces decreases with increasing @xmath142 , which corresponds to decreasing @xmath4 in a channel and thus increasing @xmath61 .",
    "the channel model is still a rather crude approximation for the end piece of a vortex sheet , but in spite of that it gives the right order of magnitude for the critical current and its dependence on @xmath142 .",
    "we can argue analogously for the continuous vortex lines .",
    "since we found only weak dependence of the helical instability on the channel width ( [ hel ] ) , the critical velocity for creating vortex lines should be essentially independent on the rotation velocity .",
