    "precise measurements of the leptonic decays of @xmath6 leptons provide a means of stringently testing various aspects of the standard model .",
    "opal previously has studied the leptonic @xmath6 decay modes by measuring the branching ratios @xcite , the michel parameters @xcite , and radiative decays @xcite .",
    "this work presents a new opal measurement of the @xmath0 branching ratio , using data taken from 1990 to 1995 at energies near the z@xmath7 peak , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 170 pb@xmath8 .",
    "a pure sample of @xmath9 pairs is selected from the lep1 data set as described in section [ tausel ] , and then the fraction of @xmath6 jets in which the @xmath6 has decayed to a muon is determined , using the selection described in section [ taumsel ] .",
    "this fraction is then corrected for backgrounds , efficiency , and bias , as described in section [ br ] .",
    "the selection of @xmath0 candidates relies on only a few variables , each of which provides a highly effective means of separating background events from signal events while minimising systematic uncertainty .",
    "this new measurement supersedes the previous opal measurement of b@xmath10 which was obtained using data collected in 1991 and 1992 , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 39 pb@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "opal @xcite is a general purpose detector covering almost the full solid angle with approximate cylindrical symmetry about the @xmath11 beam axis . in the opal coordinate system",
    ", the @xmath12 beam direction defines the @xmath13 axis , and the @xmath14 axis points from the detector towards the centre of the lep ring .",
    "the polar angle @xmath15 is measured from the @xmath13 axis , and the azimuthal angle @xmath16 is measured from the @xmath14 axis .",
    "selection efficiencies and kinematic variable distributions were modelled using monte carlo simulated @xmath17 event samples generated with the koralz 4.02 package @xcite and the tauola 2.0 library @xcite .",
    "these events were then passed through a full simulation of the opal detector @xcite .",
    "background contributions from non-@xmath6 sources were evaluated using monte carlo samples based on the following generators : multihadronic events @xmath18 were simulated using jetset 7.3 and jetset 7.4 @xcite , @xmath19 events using koralz @xcite , bhabha events using bhwide @xcite , and two - photon events using vermaseren @xcite .",
    "at lep1 , electrons and positrons were made to collide at centre - of - mass energies close to the z@xmath7 peak , producing z@xmath7 bosons at rest which subsequently decayed into back - to - back pairs of leptons or quarks , from which the @xmath17 pairs were selected for this analysis .",
    "these highly relativistic @xmath6 particles decay in flight close to the interaction point , resulting in two highly - collimated , back - to - back jets in the tracking chamber .",
    "the @xmath17 selection requires that an event have two jets as defined by the cone algorithm in reference @xcite , each with a cone half - angle of @xmath20 .",
    "the main sources of background to the @xmath17 selection are bhabha events , dimuon events , multihadron events , and two - photon events .",
    "this analysis uses the standard opal @xmath9 selection @xcite , which was developed to identify @xmath17 pairs and to remove these backgrounds , with slight modifications to further reduce bhabha background in the @xmath9 sample .    for each type of background remaining in the @xmath9 sample",
    ", a variable was chosen in which the signal and background can be visibly distinguished .",
    "the relative proportion of background was enhanced by loosening criteria which would normally remove that particular type of background from the @xmath9 sample , and/or by applying further criteria to reduce the contribution from signal and to remove other types of background .",
    "a comparison of the data and monte carlo distributions was then used to assess the modelling of the background . in most cases ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation was found to be consistent with the data .",
    "when the data and monte carlo distributions did not agree , the monte carlo simulation was adjusted to fit the data .",
    "uncertainties of 4% to 20% were assigned to the background estimates as a result of these comparisons .",
    "the @xmath9 selection leaves a sample of 96,898 candidate @xmath9 events , with a predicted fractional background of @xmath21 .",
    "the backgrounds in the @xmath9 sample are summarised in table [ ttausel ] .",
    "the errors shown in the table include both the statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the effect of a small bias in this event selection is discussed in section [ systs ] .",

    "after the @xmath17 selection , each of the 193,796 candidate @xmath6 jets is analysed individually to see whether it exhibits the characteristics of the required @xmath0 signature . a muon from a @xmath6 decay will result in a track in the central tracking chamber , little energy in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and a track in the muon chambers .",
    "the @xmath0 selection is based primarily on information from the central tracking chamber and the muon chambers .",
    "calorimeter information is not used in the main selection , but instead is used to create an independent @xmath0 control sample that is used to evaluate the systematic error in the monte carlo efficiency prediction .",
    "the selection criteria which are used to identify the @xmath0 candidates are described below .",
    "the @xmath0 candidates are selected from jets with one to three tracks in the tracking chamber , where the tracks are ordered according to decreasing particle momentum .",
    "the highest momentum track is assumed to be the muon candidate .",
    "muons are identified as producing a signal in at least three muon chamber layers , i.e. @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the number of muon chamber layers activated by a passing particle , as shown in figure [ cuts ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the value of the @xmath32 cut was chosen to minimise the background while retaining signal .",
    "tracks in the muon chambers are reconstructed independently from those in the tracking chamber .",
    "the candidate muon track in the tracking chamber is typically well - aligned with the corresponding track in the muon chambers , whereas this is not the case for hadronic @xmath6 decays , which are the main source of background in the sample .",
    "the majority of these background jets contain a pion which interacts in the hadronic calorimeter , resulting in the production of secondary particles which emerge from the calorimeter and generate signals in the muon chambers , a process known as pion punchthrough .",
    "therefore , a `` muon matching '' variable , @xmath33 , which compares the agreement between the direction of a track reconstructed in the tracking chamber and that of the track reconstructed in the muon chambers , is used to differentiate the signal @xmath0 decays from hadronic @xmath6 decays determines the difference in @xmath16 and in @xmath15 between a track reconstructed in the tracking chamber and one reconstructed in the muon chambers .",
    "the differences are divided by an error estimate and added in quadrature to form a @xmath34-like comparison of the directions . ] .",
    "it is required that @xmath33 have a value of less than 5 , ( see figure [ cuts ] ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the position of the cut was chosen to minimise the background while retaining signal .    in order to reduce background from dimuon events",
    ", it is required that the momentum of the highest momentum particle in at least one of the two jets in the event , i.e. @xmath35 in the candidate jet and @xmath36 in the opposite jet , must be less than 40 gev / c .",
    "( see figure [ ptks ] ( a ) . )",
    "although the @xmath0 candidates in general are expected to have one track , in approximately 2% of these decays a radiated photon converts to an @xmath11 pair , resulting in one or two extra tracks in the tracking chamber . in order to retain these jets but eliminate background jets",
    ", it is required that the scalar sum of the momenta of the two lower - momentum particles , @xmath37 + @xmath38 , must be less than 4 gev / c .",
    "( see figure [ ptks ] ( b ) . ) in cases where there is only one extra track , @xmath38 is taken to be zero .",
    "the above criteria leave a sample of 31,395 candidate @xmath0 jets .",
    "the backgrounds remaining in this sample are discussed in the next section .",
    "the quality of the data is illustrated in figure [ ptk ] , which shows the momentum of the candidate muon for jets which satisfy the @xmath0 selection criteria .",
    "the background contamination in the signal @xmath0 sample stems from other @xmath6 decay modes and from residual non-@xmath6 background in the @xmath9 sample .",
    "the procedure used to evaluate the background in the @xmath0 sample is identical to the one used to evaluate the background in the @xmath9 sample , which is outlined in section [ tausel ] , and again involves studying the distributions of sensitive variables in background - enhanced samples .",
    "it is worth noting that , in all the plots in figure [ bkdist ] , the relative proportion of background has been enhanced ( as in section [ tausel ] ) in order that the background may be evaluated . the error on",
    "each background includes the monte carlo statistical error on the background fraction as well as a systematic error associated with the background evaluation .",
    "the main backgrounds from other @xmath6 decay modes can be separated into @xmath39 , and a small number of @xmath40 jets .",
    "the @xmath39 decays can pass the @xmath0 selection when the charged hadron punches through the calorimeters , leaving a signal in the muon chambers .",
    "the absence or presence of @xmath41s has no impact on whether or not the jet is selected , since there are over 60 radiation lengths of material in the detector in front of the muon chambers .",
    "the modelling of this background is tested by studying @xmath0 jets with large deposits of energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the distribution of jet energy , @xmath42 , deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is shown in figure [ bkdist ] ( a ) .",
    "the @xmath39 fractional background estimate is @xmath43 , of which approximately 75% includes at least one @xmath41 .",
    "the main backgrounds resulting from contamination in the @xmath9 sample are @xmath27 and @xmath19 events .",
    "the @xmath27 contribution in the @xmath0 sample was evaluated by fitting the monte carlo distribution of the acollinearity angle , @xmath44 , to that of the data , as shown in figure [ bkdist ] ( b ) .",
    "this resulted in a fractional background estimate of @xmath45 .",
    "the dimuon jets ( @xmath19 ) were enhanced in the @xmath0 sample by removing the requirement that @xmath46 gev / c or @xmath47 gev / c , and then requiring that @xmath48 gev / c .",
    "the distribution of @xmath36 was then used to evaluate the agreement between the data and the monte carlo simulation for this background .",
    "the resulting estimate of the dimuon fractional background in the @xmath0 sample is @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding distribution is shown in figure [ bkdist ] ( c ) .",
    "the 3-track signal @xmath0 is due to photons which convert in the tracking chamber to an @xmath11 pair , whereas the 3-track background consists mainly of jets with three pions in the final state .",
    "electrons and pions have different rates of energy loss in the opal tracking chamber , and hence the background can be isolated from the signal by plotting the rate of energy loss as the particle traverses the tracking chamber , @xmath50 , of the second - highest - momentum particle in the jet .",
    "the monte carlo modelling was compared to the data as shown in figure [ bkdist ] ( d ) , yielding a fractional background measurement of @xmath51 .    the remaining background in the @xmath0 sample consists almost entirely of @xmath52 jets , and contributes at a level of 0.04% to the overall sample . the total estimated fractional background in the @xmath0 sample after the selection is @xmath53 .",

    "the @xmath0 branching ratio is given by @xmath56 where the first term , @xmath57 , is extracted from the data and is the number of @xmath0 candidates after the @xmath0 selection , divided by the number of @xmath6 candidates selected by the @xmath9 selection .",

    "the monte carlo prediction of the efficiency is cross - checked using a control sample , and will be discussed in section [ systs ] .",
    "@xmath61 is a bias factor which accounts for the fact that the @xmath9 selection does not select all @xmath6 decay modes with the same efficiency .",
    "the corresponding values of these parameters for the @xmath0 selection are shown in table [ tbrvalues ] .",
    "equation [ ebr ] results in a branching ratio value of @xmath62 where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .      the statistical uncertainty in the branching ratio is taken to be the binomial error in the uncorrected branching ratio , @xmath63 .",
    "the systematic errors include the contributions associated with the monte carlo modelling of each of the main sources of background in the @xmath0 sample , the error in the efficiency , the error in the background in the @xmath9 sample , and the error in the bias factor .",

    "a potentially important source of systematic error in the analysis is the monte carlo modelling of the selection efficiency . in order to estimate the error on the efficiency ,",
    "both data and monte carlo simulated jets are required to satisfy the calorimeter selection criteria .",
    "this produces two control samples of candidate @xmath0 jets , one which is data , and one which is monte carlo simulation .",
    "each of these control samples is then passed through the @xmath0 tracking selection . the efficiency of the tracking selection is then calculated for the data and for the monte carlo simulation by taking the ratio of the number of jets in the control sample which pass the selection , over the number of jets which were in the control sample .",
    "the difference between the efficiency determined using the data and that determined using the monte carlo simulation was taken as the systematic error in the monte carlo efficiency prediction .",
    "further checks of the monte carlo modelling were made by varying each of the selection criteria . in each case , the resulting changes in the branching ratio were within the systematic uncertainty that had already been assigned due to the background and efficiency errors .",
    "the @xmath6 monte carlo simulations create events for the different @xmath6 decay modes , where the proportions are determined by the branching ratios @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath9 selection does not select each mode of @xmath6 decay with equal efficiency .",
    "this can introduce a bias in the measured value of b(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the @xmath9 selection bias factor , @xmath61 , measures the degree to which the @xmath9 selection favours or suppresses the decay @xmath0 relative to other @xmath6 decay modes .",

    "the value of b@xmath71 obtained in this analysis can be used in conjunction with the previously measured opal value of b@xmath72 to test various aspects of the standard model .",
    "for example , the standard model assumption of lepton universality requires that the coupling of the w particle is identical to all three generations of leptons .",
    "the leptonic @xmath6 decays have already provided some of the most stringent tests of this hypothesis ( see , for example , @xcite ) . with the improved precision of b@xmath71 presented in this note ,",
    "it is worth testing this assumption again .",
    "in addition , the leptonic @xmath6 branching ratios can be used to measure the michel parameter @xmath73 , which can be used to set a limit on the mass of the charged higgs particle in the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",

    "the standard model assumption of lepton universality requires that the coupling constants @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , are identical , thus the ratio @xmath88 is expected to be unity .",
    "this can be tested experimentally by taking the ratio of the corresponding branching ratios , b@xmath71/b@xmath72 .",
    "the measured branching ratio is related to the predicted partial decay width via the expression b@xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the total @xmath6 decay width , or the inverse of the @xmath6 lifetime . taking the ratio of b(@xmath0 ) and",

    "we use equation [ egmge ] to compute the coupling constant ratio , which , with the value of b(@xmath0 ) from this work and the opal measurement of b(@xmath91 ) = @xmath94 @xcite , yields @xmath95 in good agreement with expectation .",
    "in addition , the expressions for the partial widths of the @xmath0 and @xmath96 decays can be rearranged to test lepton universality between the first and third lepton generations , yielding the expression @xmath97 using the opal value for the @xmath6 lifetime , @xmath98 fs @xcite , the bes collaboration value for the @xmath6 mass , @xmath99 mev/@xmath100 @xcite , and the particle data group @xcite values for the muon mass , @xmath101 , and muon lifetime , @xmath102 , we obtain , @xmath103 again in good agreement with the standard model assumption of lepton universality .",

    "the coupling terms take the following values : @xmath104 and all other @xmath105 , where @xmath106 = s , v , or t for scalar , vector , or tensor couplings , and @xmath107 = l or r for the chirality of the initial and final state charged leptons .",
    "these coupling terms represent the relative contribution of each particular type of coupling to the overall coupling strength , @xmath108 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath6 leptonic decay spectrum is more conveniently parameterized in terms of the four michel parameters @xcite , @xmath73 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 , each of which is a linear combination of all possible couplings @xmath112 .",

    "it is possible then to solve for @xmath73 by taking the ratio @xmath115 , or equivalently by taking the ratio of the measured branching ratios @xcite . using equations [ widlep2 ] and [ egamma ]",
    ", we find @xmath116 where @xmath117 is taken to be zero and assuming lepton universality ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the result presented here , together with the opal measurement of b@xmath72 @xcite and equation [ efindeta ] , then results in a value of @xmath4 .",
    "this can be compared with a previous opal result of @xmath119 @xcite which has been obtained by fitting the @xmath6 decay spectrum .",
    "in addition , if one assumes that the first term in the expression for @xmath73 is non - zero , then there must be a non - zero scalar coupling constant , such that @xmath120 .",
