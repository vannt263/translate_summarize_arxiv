    "here we discuss the generality of the mechanism of entanglement prethermalization .",
    "as discussed in the main text , the entanglement prethermalization results from the long - lasting influence of the initial entanglement between the `` left '' and `` right '' subsystems .",
    "usually , the effect of the initial entanglement fades out during the time evolution and is not relevant for long - time behavior of physical quantities .",
    "if there are some energy degeneracies , however , the initial entanglement remains and can give large contribution to the measured values of physical quantities .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath112 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the hamiltonians of the left and right subsystems , respectively , and commute with each other .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 and @xmath4 have the same energy spectrum , i.e. the two subsystems are identical .",
    "the energy eigenstate of @xmath113 is denoted by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the degree of degeneracies of the eigenstates of @xmath114 with energy @xmath115 is denoted by @xmath116 , and thus @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we assume the non - resonant condition ; if @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , or equivalently , if @xmath122 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 or @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    from this assumption ,",
    "the infinite - time average of the density matrix is given by @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the projection onto the hilbert subspace with the energy @xmath94 , that is , @xmath127 by defining @xmath128 , @xmath96 is expressed as @xmath129 with @xmath130 .",
    "if we define @xmath131 , the explicit form of @xmath95 is given by @xmath132 for @xmath133 , and @xmath134 although the coherence between the energy eigenstates with different energies is lost by the time averaging , the coherence among the degenerate states remains and the left subsystem is still entangled with the right one in general .",
    "this entanglement contributes to a significant deviation from the thermal equilibrium .    when the initial state has the parity symmetry , @xmath135 , @xmath136 if a coefficient @xmath137 is not decoupled like @xmath138 , the left subsystem and the right subsystem are entangled .",
    "the initial entanglement remains even after the time average when there are degeneracies .",
    "we note that even if there is no initial entanglement between the left and the right and the time evolutions of the two subsystems are completely independent , some quantum correlations may appear in the time - averaged density matrix , as is obvious from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi_parity ] ) ; even if there is no initial entanglement and @xmath139 , @xmath95 is an entangled state . in order to understand this aspect",
    ", we consider a two - level system , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and simply write @xmath142 . here",
    "@xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the initial state is assumed to be @xmath145 the infinite - time average of the density matrix is then given by @xmath146 actually , this state does not have entanglement because @xmath96 is separable by definition : @xmath147 however , it has nonzero quantum discord @xcite , and hence the correlation between the left and the right in @xmath96 is not fully classical even in this case .",
    "when a physical quantity of interest @xmath148 has no large matrix element of the form @xmath149 , we can neglect the quantum coherence between @xmath87 and @xmath150 in @xmath96 . in that case , we can use the projection operator @xmath151 instead of @xmath126 defined by @xmath152 for @xmath133 and @xmath153 .",
    "the infinite - time average of the density matrix is then approximated by @xmath154 in the sense of @xmath155 . here",
    "@xmath156 and @xmath157    in the case of the lieb - liniger model discussed in the main text , @xmath158 and @xmath159 correspond to @xmath69 and @xmath160 , respectively .",
    "the degeneracy is due to the reflection symmetry , @xmath161 , so @xmath162 for every @xmath158 .",
    "therefore , @xmath163 in the initial state discussed in the main text , the total momentum is zero , @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 because of the reflection symmetry .",
    "thus @xmath166 and clearly the left and the right subsystems are entangled .    in conclusion , in the general setup , we have shown that the infinite - time average of the density matrix can have some amount of entanglement between the left subsystem and the right one .",
    "the only requirement for this is that there are degeneracies in @xmath114 ; we have not assumed the integrability of the system , the bose statistics , the dimensionality , and so on . the entanglement prethermalization is therefore considered to be a generic phenomenon that can be observed in split subsystems and is not restricted to the one - dimensional integrable bose gas"

    "<S> although the exact eigenenergies can be obtained by solving the bethe ansatz equations , it is challenging to calculate the time evolution of physical quantities because it requires us to evaluate the matrix elements of an observable in the basis of exact eigenstates . a recent achievement made in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite enables us to evaluate matrix elements of field operators by using the gaudin - korepin  @xcite and slavnov formulae  @xcite . by adopting this technique , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the time evolution of correlation functions necessary for investigating prethermalization in split 1d bose gases .    before going into a detailed discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we briefly describe the setup of our study ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setupll](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a 1d bose gas which is initially prepared in the ground state @xmath2 and split into two parts @xmath3 and @xmath4 . after the splitting , the two gases are allowed to evolve in time independently : @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate two types of correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> one is the auto - correlation ( left correlation ) @xmath6 and the other one is the cross - correlation ( left - right correlation ) defined by @xmath7 . in a few - body system , </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in time are large , so we compute the time average of these quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are shown in fig .  [ setupll](b ) for @xmath1 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setupll](b ) , each auto - correlation function rapidly relaxes to an equilibrium curve at an effective temperature over the entire region . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation function approaches an equilibrium curve only at short distance but exhibits markedly different behavior at long distance . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlation reaches a stationary value by about @xmath10 .    the effective temperature determined by fitting the numerical data with the canonical distribution is found to be lower than the equilibrium temperature determined by comparing the energy of the state @xmath11 with that of the equilibrium state ; for example , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath1 , which implies that each individual bose gas ( left or right ) is in a prethermalized state . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> prethermalization of an individual bose gas after the split is described by a gibbs state with an effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> however , prethermalization observed in the left - right interference can not be described by any gibbs state with some effective temperature , and hence this prethermalization is not of the same types as that observed in a single bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> the former emerges due to the initial entanglement between the left and the right as shown later ; hence we call it the entanglement prethermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> this locally thermal but non - locally non - thermal state can also be observed for larger numbers of particles . </S>",
    "<S> the infinite - time averages of the auto - correlation @xmath14 and the cross - correlation @xmath15 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation ] . </S>",
    "<S> the infinite - time average of the cross - correlation function @xmath15 deviates at long distance from the equilibrium one @xmath16 calculated by the equilibrium ensemble at an effective temperature ( see fig .  [ correlation](b ) ) , while the left @xmath14 ( or right @xmath17 ) correlation function is indistinguishable from the left equilibrium one @xmath18 ( or right @xmath19 ) which is fitted by choosing an appropriate effective temperature ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation](a ) ) . from this observation </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the initial entanglement between the left and right persists during the many - body dynamics and prevents the system from being thermalized . </S>",
    "<S> usually , an initial entanglement is washed out in the course of time evolution and does not influence the long - time average of a physical quantity . by extracting the effect of initial entanglement from the infinite - time average of the density matrix , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the initial entanglement can actually affect the infinite - time average of the cross - correlation function @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , we also show that the initial entanglement does not affect the long - time average of a quantity concerning the two individual bose gases . </S>",
    "<S> these facts demonstrate the entanglement prethermalization in a few - body system .    </S>",
    "<S> a fundamental question is how small the system can exhibit prethermalization . to address this question , we perform exact many - body calculations for @xmath20 and 6 , and find that the smallest system with @xmath1 already show not only individual thermalization but also entanglement prethermalization . in view of a recent experimental achievement to create systems with a fixed number of atoms up to @xmath21 @xcite , the result of our work should be amenable to experimental test .    </S>",
    "<S> now we shall explain our study in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the lieb - liniger model @xcite which describes a 1d bose gas with a repulsive delta - function interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we impose periodic boundary conditions of the system size @xmath22 on the wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> the second - quantized hamiltonian of the lieb - liniger model is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the bosonic field operator and we employ a system of units with @xmath25 . </S>",

    "<S> the exact energy eigenstates can be obtained by using the bethe ansatz method . </S>",
    "<S> each @xmath28-particle eigenstate @xmath29 is labeled by a set of quasi - momenta @xmath30 that satisfy the bethe ansatz equations ( baes ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 s , which are called the bethe quantum numbers , are integers for odd @xmath28 and half integers for even @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the total momentum @xmath34 and energy eigenvalue @xmath35 are given in terms of quasi - momenta as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> if we specify a set of the bethe quantum numbers @xmath38 , the baes have a unique real solution @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a quantum quench , which mimics a coherent splitting of the 1d bose gas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the splitting process is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ setupll ] , where the lieb - liniger model is split into two parts ( left and right ) that do not interact with each other . </S>",
    "<S> this process places each particle in a superposition of the left and right states . </S>",
    "<S> let us introduce the field operators of `` symmetric bosons '' @xmath40 and `` anti - symmetric bosons '' @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are operators of different bose fields . before the split </S>",
    "<S> , symmetric bosons correspond to the ground state in the @xmath44-axis ( the direction perpendicular to the 1d bose gas ) , while anti - symmetric bosons are responsible for the excitation in the @xmath44-axis . </S>",
    "<S> if the angular frequency of the radial trapping potential is denoted by @xmath45 , which is assumed to be sufficiently large compared with any other relevant energy scales , this excitation energy is given by @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the initial hamiltonian before the split , @xmath46 , is given by @xmath47 after the split , the left gas does not interact with the right one , so the hamiltonian after the quench @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 the coupling constant after the quench @xmath51 is chosen to be @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the number of particles on the left or on the right obeys a binomial distribution since each particle is superposed between the left and right states with equal weights . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the numbers of particles of the left and right by @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> our initial state @xmath2 is chosen as the ground state of @xmath55 , and the state at time @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 . by expanding @xmath2 in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution is easily calculated once we determine the expansion coefficients @xmath62 since @xmath63 can be calculated exactly by the bethe ansatz method .    to examine whether our system displays prethermalization for several numbers of particles , we calculate two - point correlation functions in fig .  [ correlation ] . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation](a ) , the red curve shows the result of @xmath14 which we calculate by using the bethe ansatz method . </S>",
    "<S> the blue curve shows the thermal equilibrium average @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the autocorrelation function @xmath14 is well described by the equilibrium distribution @xmath18 if @xmath65 is appropriately determined , e.g. @xmath66 for @xmath67 .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation](b ) , the cross - correlation function @xmath15 depicted by the red curve is compared with the equilibrium correlation function @xmath16 depicted by the blue curve , where @xmath68 . at short distances , they agree with each other at a temperature determined by the auto - correlation described above . however , they disagree at long distances . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the left - right interference modes with long wavelength have temperatures different from the other modes . in a true equilibrium state , </S>",
    "<S> all the modes should have the same temperature , and hence this result shows that the system is thermalized only partially , which is a characteristic of prethermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us explain the physical mechanism of the prethermalization . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath69 and @xmath70 be the bethe momenta of the left and the right , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from the parity symmetry that @xmath71 and @xmath72 . by neglecting the other type of degeneracies , the infinite - time average of the density matrix @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a fully entangled state consisting of the two degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal components in the basis @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 and the off - diagonal components are given by @xmath78 which arise from the initial entanglement between the left and right . because of the entanglement of @xmath79 , the off - diagonal elements @xmath80 do not contribute to the expectation value of any observable involving the left or right alone such as @xmath81 for any observable @xmath82 consisting of @xmath42 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , when we consider the interference between the left and the right , off - diagonal components have a nonvanishing contribution and prevent thermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> the crucial point is that the quantum coherence between the degenerate states , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , do not vanish even after the infinite - time average , and hence the initial entanglement between the left and the right can survive , albeit partially . </S>",
    "<S> this is a general result in quantum mechanics and not restricted to the lieb - liniger model . </S>",
    "<S> we can indeed show that if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are degenerate , the initial entanglement between the left and the right can significantly affect the steady state . </S>",
    "<S> an eigenstate of @xmath86 is denoted by @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> the indices @xmath90 and @xmath91 distinguish the degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> then the infinite - time average of the density matrix reads @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the probability that the energy of the total system is given by @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the projection of the initial state onto the subspace spanned by the energy eigenstates with the energy @xmath94 . if @xmath95 has entanglement , @xmath96 also has entanglement in general . whether or not @xmath95 has entanglement depends , of course , on the specific problem , but the above argument shows that the initial entanglement can affect the steady state if there are energy degeneracies . </S>",
    "<S> see supplementary material for more detail .    . </S>",
    "<S> * the diagonal and off - diagonal components are added to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation ] for the case of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the purple dashed curve and green dashed curve show the diagonal and off - diagonal contributions , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lengths of the orange arrows are equal . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we numerically calculate the diagonal and off - diagonal components as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ diagnal ] . </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal contribution emerges at long distances , which gives a major contribution to the deviation of @xmath15 from its equilibrium counterpart as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ correlation](b ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the contribution from the diagonal elements agrees with the equilibrium curve . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the nonlocal correlation between the left and the right plays a decisive role for the entanglement prethermalization .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose an experimental setup to observe entanglement prethermalization , that is , a coherent splitting of an ultracold interacting bose / fermi gas in a 3d spherical harmonic trap into halves . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , entanglement prethermalization occurs if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are degenerate , and this condition holds in this setup due to the 3d - rotational invariance if the interactions between particles are invariant under 3d rotations . </S>",
    "<S> now that a cigar - shaped - trap version of the setup has been realized with small numbers of fermions  @xcite , the setup can be realized by using equal trapping frequencies along all the three directions . since the degeneracy is lifted in the cigar - shaped trap and entanglement prethermalization </S>",
    "<S> is not present in there , it is worthwhile investigating how entanglement prethermalization is affected under the continuous deformation of the trap from the spherical one to the cigar - shaped one .    in conclusion , we have discovered a new mechanism of prethermalization by calculating the infinite - time average of two - point correlation functions in a few - body system ; the initial entanglement between the two spatially separated subsystems plays a crucial role in the prethermalization observed in a coherently split 1d bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> the diagonal elements of the time - averaged density matrix stand for coherence within one subsystem which explains the equilibrium correlation functions at an effective temperature . on the other hand , the effect of entanglement manifests itself in the off - diagonal elements , and it can not be described by the gibbs ensemble at any effective temperature . </S>",
    "<S> such an entanglement prethermalization is found in a few - body system and should be observed in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our study reveals that prethermalization found in coherently split systems belongs to a new class of prethermalization , in which the initial entanglement plays a crucial role . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of energy degeneracies in each of the left and the right subsystems is crucial and the mechanism of the entanglement prethermalization does not depend on the dimensionality , the quantum statistics , or the integrability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the entanglement prethermalization should occur not only in the lieb - liniger model but also in more general systems such as a system composed of three dimensional harmonic oscillators interacting with each other .    * methods *    * how to obtain expansion coefficients . * </S>",
    "<S> the expansion coefficients @xmath97 in equation  ( [ eq : state ] ) are defined as @xmath98 , where @xmath2 is the ground state of @xmath99 . to obtain them , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the matrix elements of @xmath99 in the basis @xmath100 and diagonalize this matrix . </S>",
    "<S> each matrix element @xmath101 contains matrix elements of the field operators such as @xmath102 and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> these matrix elements can be evaluated by using the gaudin - korepin @xcite and slavnov formulae @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a difficulty here is that the dimension of the matrix @xmath58 is infinite because the bethe quantum numbers @xmath104 run over all the integers or all the half - integers depending on whether the number of bosons is odd or even , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore truncate the range of bethe quantum numbers as @xmath105 for all @xmath106 , where the value of @xmath107 is chosen sufficiently large . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this is just an approximation for the initial state and not for the dynamics . because eigenenergies for the bethe eigenstates can be evaluated in a numerically exact manner by solving the bethe ansatz equation , the dynamics is still exact . </S>",
    "<S> we can then diagonalize the truncated matrix @xmath58 , and the eigenvector associated with the minimum eigenvalue gives us the approximate expansion coefficients @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> * equilibrium correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> * one might think that the equilibrium density matrix associated with @xmath49 is given by @xmath108/{\\rm tr}\\exp[-\\beta(\\hat{h}_{\\rm l}+\\hat{h}_{\\rm r})]$ ] . in our setup , however , there are some conserved quantities which we must take into account . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the total momentum is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> since the initial state is the ground state of @xmath99 , the total momentum is zero : @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , as each boson is distributed to the left or right randomly and the redistribution of particles do not take place after the quench , the number of particles @xmath53 in the left bose gas obeys the binomial distribution , @xmath110 . </S>",
