    "recent astronomical observations strongly support a concordance model of cosmology , where the bulk of the content of the universe is comprised of an unknown dark sector , of which about 23% is the pressureless dark matter and about 73% is dark energy with negative pressure that drives the present acceleration of the universe . in the literature",
    "there are a lot of interesting and compelling models of particle physics which provide candidates for dark matter and dark energy .",
    "however , it is always much more desirable that a single model explains both for the dark sector . recently , two of us ( x.b . and x.z . ) with m. li@xcite have considered a class of quintessence models , originally designed for the understanding of the current acceleration of the universe and showed that after supersymmetrization the fermionic superpartner of the quintessence , the quintessino , serves as a good candidate for the dark matter particle .",
    "very much like the quarks and leptons in the same group representation in the grand unified theories , the components of the dark matter and the dark energy belong to one superfield in this model . in this scenario ,",
    "the quintessino is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) and the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) can be either neutralino or slepton , typically the stau . during the evolution of the universe ,",
    "the nlsp freezes out of the thermal background , then decays into quintessino which makes up the present dark matter .",
    "generally the quintessino dark matter particles interact with the ordinary matter very weakly , so the traditional techniques for the direct or indirect detection of the neutralino dark matter would not be useful for detecting quintessino dark matter .",
    "there are , however , several silent features of the quintessino dark matter model which make it distinguishable .",
    "firstly , we should note that being one superfield the quintessino has the same interaction with matter as the quintessence and thus be severely constrained . as we know that the primary motivation to introduce the quintessence field is to drive the acceleration of the universe , so we have to preserve the properties of quintessence after introducing interactions between quintessence and the matter . in order to keep the quintessence potential flat and avoid the long range force induced by quintessence",
    "we impose a global shift symmetry for its interactions@xcite , i.e. , interactions which are invariant under @xmath2 .",
    "one possible interaction is proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath3 , which can be taken to test the quintessence model by observing the rotation of the polarization plane of the light from distant sources .",
    "another interesting form is @xmath4 with @xmath5 the baryon or baryon minus lepton current@xcite which gives rise to a new mechanism of the baryogenesis .",
    "secondly , the bbn observation indicates that the light element @xmath6li may be underabundant compared with the theoretical estimate@xcite .",
    "decaying particles after bbn might provide one way to solve the problem@xcite . as shown explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite ( and argued for the gravitino dark matter models in ref .",
    "@xcite ) the electromagnetic energy associated with the non - thermal production of quintessino dark matter particles can play the role to reconcile the observations and the theory .",
    "thirdly , the quintessino dark matter in this model is produced nonthermally .",
    "the property of the quintessino dark matter is characterized by the comoving free streaming scale .",
    "depending on the time when the nlsp decay and the initial energy of the quintessino when it is produced , it can be either cold or warm dark matter . in the latter case it helps solve the problems of the cold dark matter on subgalactic scales@xcite .",
    "fourthly , this scenario for dark matter predicts the existence of long - lived nlsp with life time @xmath7 sec . for the stau nlsp",
    "it can be produced and collected on colliders@xcite and the properties of quintessino can be studied by examining the stau decay . the scenario with gravitino lsp and stau nlsp",
    "is studied in the literature@xcite . for the case of quintessino lsp",
    "the stau will have different decay modes . in the present paper we are not attempting to study all the features of quintessino dark matter mentioned above ,",
    "instead we will focus on the study of the nlsp stau production and detection .",
    "we leave other phenomenological studies for future publications@xcite",
    ".    the cosmological stau will not survive until today , however it can be produced in the extremely high energy astrophysical processes .",
    "experimentally these stau can then be observed by the large cosmic particle detectors on the earth , such as the l3c@xcite , superkamiokande@xcite , or several proposed neutrino telescopes@xcite .",
    "since the stau are much heavier than other stable or long lived charged particles , such as the electron or the muon , they are expected to leave distinct trajectory in the detectors .",
    "there are different sources of the stau fluxes .",
    "however , since the stau has life time about one year we expect the stau flux from distant objects , such as agns , should be quite low",
    ". therefore , most stau signal will come from the earth .",
    "one stau flux comes from the high energy cosmic neutrino collision with the earth matter and the other one comes from the collision of the high energy cosmic proton and nuclei with the atmosphere . in this paper",
    "we will present a detailed calculation of the stau flux produced in the simpler case by the cosmic neutrino collision with the earth matter and leave the discussions on the atmospheric flux of stau in another work@xcite . in a recent paper by albuquerque ,",
    "burdman and chacko the production of the nlsp stau by the high energy neutrino flux has been proposed as a possibility of probing for the supersymmetry breaking scale using the neutrino telescope@xcite .",
    "the stau flux thus generated depends on three ingredients : the flux of the primary cosmic ray of the incident neutrinos , the cross sections of the neutrino and nucleon and the range of the charged stau on the earth . in this paper",
    "we will show that there will be one to several hundred of stau produced per year at a detector with effective area of one @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we study how quintessino dark matter is produced by the stau nlsp decay . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the neutrino - nucleon interacting cross sections . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the energy distribution of @xmath0 and its range . in sec",
    "v , we describe our calculations and present the results .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "vi is our conclusion .",
    "in ref . @xcite we focus our study of quintessino dark matter on the case of neutralino being nlsp . therefore we will first study the viability of stau nlsp to produce the quintessino dark matter in this section .",
    "the most general form of the interaction between the quintessence and the leptons that obeys the shift symmetry is given by@xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the cutoff scale and @xmath11 being coupling constant in the effective theory .",
    "the astrophysical and laboratory experiments put a lower bound on @xmath10 of about @xmath12 @xcite . here",
    "we take a simple form of the interaction between quintessence and the lepton @xmath13 @xmath14 after supersymmetrization and using the on - shell condition of @xmath13 we get the relevant coupling for our discussion @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the left- and right - handed stau respectively .",
    "the quintessino is produced by the stau decay , @xmath18 . from eq .",
    "( [ qff ] ) , the time scale for the stau decay is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the scale for grand unification .",

    "there will be no constraints on the process from bbn .    for higher scale @xmath10",
    ", the stau decays after bbn .",
    "the electromagnetic energy released in the stau decay may destroy the successful prediction on the light elements abundance of bbn@xcite and the planckian spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite .",
    "therefore we have to consider the constraint from bbn and cmb . the electromagnetic energy released in the stau decay",
    "can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial electromagnetic energy released in each stau decay and @xmath25 \\left [ \\frac{\\omega_{dm}}{0.23 } \\right]$ ] is the number density of stau normalized to the number density of the background photons@xcite . as the argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take @xmath26 for simplicity , where @xmath27 is the energy of @xmath13 in the decay products .",
    "lifetime @xmath13 and energy release @xmath28 in stau decay for @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( from right to left ) and @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( from top to bottom ) .",
    "we take @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the contour of the chemical potential for photon distribution function is @xmath37 , with the region to the right of it being excluded by cmb@xcite .",
    "the shaded regions are excluded by bbn data@xcite .",
    "the circle represents the best fit region with @xmath38@xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ para ] , we plot the decay time and energy release for @xmath29 from @xmath30 to @xmath39 and @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath40 .",
    "the shaded region is excluded by bbn .",
    "the best fit point @xmath41 is covered in the parameter space , which can suppress the level of @xmath6li and make it to be consistent with the observation @xcite .",
    "we will not further consider the constraint from bbn on the stau three - body hadronic decay@xcite in this work . compared with the recent analysis given by feng _",
    "al__@xcite , we find there is viable parameter space around the best fit point even after imposing the hadronic constraint in our model .",
    "therefore , we get the conclusion that the quintessino dark matter produced by stau decay is a viable dark matter model , which is consistent with the present experimental constraints .",
    "probing for the long lived stau provides an indirect support for our dark matter model . in this section",
    "we calculate the inclusive cross section of stau production from the collision of high energy cosmic neutrinos on the earth matter .    the process which we are interested in is @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an isoscalar nucleon , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) refers to any type of hadrons and leptons .",
    "at the parton level the corresponding process is @xmath46 with the exchanges of the chargino , @xmath47 , or neutralino , @xmath48 in the @xmath49-channel , where @xmath50 stands for the valence and sea quarks . the @xmath51 and @xmath52 in eq .",

    "the cross section for the standard model charge current process is also plotted in the figure . ]    for the soft susy breaking terms we take the parameters as @xmath59 in the calculations , which gives rise to a lighter stau of about @xmath60 .",
    "the gaugino masses and higgsino mixing parameter are taken as @xmath61 , so that the neutralinos and charginos are heavier than @xmath0 .",
    "these parameters give the lightest neutralino mass @xmath62 and the lighter chargino mass @xmath63 . in fig .",
    "[ cross ] , we plot the cross sections for @xmath64 , which are the most sensitive supersymmetric parameters to the cross section . another set of the soft parameters are taken as @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "( we will denote this set of parameters by @xmath68 in the text . ) in the figure , the inclusive cross section of the charged current process @xmath69 anything is also plotted .",
    "one can see that the supersymmetric cross section is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the standard model one .",
    "when the staus propagate in the earth they lose energy through ionization and radiation processes : bremsstrahlung , pair production , and photonuclear interactions .",
    "while the energy loss due to ionization is only slowly logarithmically increasing with the energy , the radiation processes cause a loss which in the high energy limit is proportional to the stau energy .",
    "the energy loss is usually expressed as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is due to ionization and @xmath72 is due to radiation .",
    "we take @xmath73 , which is the same as the ionization loss coefficient of @xmath74 in the rock@xcite . since @xmath72 is proportional to the inverse square of the incident particle mass , we take @xmath75 . for @xmath74 , @xmath76@xcite .",
    "we then obtain the range of the stau with initial energy @xmath77 @xmath78 where we have assumed that the energy threshold of the detector can be very small .",
    "the range of the stau is actually a distribution as a function of its energy . for simplicity",
    ", we use the range for the average energy of stau , @xmath79 , in the calculation of the stau flux . since the collision is through @xmath49-channel , the stau from the slepton decay and that from the squark decay have very different energies . to discriminate them , we denote them by @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and the corresponding rang @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "angular ( @xmath84 ) and energy distribution of the final particles in the @xmath85 cm system , with the beam direction referring to the direction of the incident nucleon .",
    "the figures represent the angular distribution of @xmath80 and @xmath81 with the beam direction and the energy distributions for @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath86 respectively and the angle between the two staus .",
    "we take the cm energy of @xmath87 and @xmath88 at 1000 gev . at higher energies the angular distribution of @xmath89",
    "is more concentrated at @xmath90 and the angle between them becomes smaller , while the energy distribution is almost not changed . ]    for @xmath80 , we assume it has the same energy as the initial slepton , since all the three flavor sleptons have the similar masses . while for @xmath81 , we have to calculate the energy distribution for the process @xmath91 . in our calculation the energy distributions for the process @xmath92 are obtained by using the monte carlo method to calculate the four - body final state . in fig .",
    "[ distri ] we plot the angular and the energy distribution of the final state particles of the process above in the @xmath85 cm system .",
    "the angle between the two stau is plotted in the last panel . from the figure",
    "we see that the two stau are almost in the same direction as the incident neutrinos .",
    "this is easy to be understood since the struck quark carries only small fraction of the total momentum of the nucleon . as the energy increases , the @xmath80 and @xmath81 are more concentrated in the forward direction of the incident neutrinos .",
    "therefore , the transverse momentum of the slepton in the cm system is generally much smaller than the momentum of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . considering that the momentum of the struck quark is widely distributed from just above the threshold to the total momentum carried by the nucleon",
    ", we find it is difficult to estimate the transverse momentum of the slepton . in the @xmath85 cm system , the average energy of @xmath80 changes from @xmath93 to @xmath94 , while the average energy of @xmath81 changes from @xmath95 to @xmath96 , both depending not sensitively on the energy of the neutrino , @xmath97 , and the squark mass .",
    "we fix @xmath98 , @xmath99 in the cm systerm as a simplification of the calculation . assuming that the two stau are both in the forward direction , we boost them to the laboratory system .",
    "we then get @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the energy of the primary cosmic neutrinos , and we ignore the @xmath0 mass in the second step , which is a rough approximation at low energies .",
    "waxman and bahcall ( wb ) have set an upper bound on the high energy diffuse neutrino flux from the observed cosmic ray flux at high energies .",
    "depending on the evolution of the source activity , they gave the limit on muon neutrino and anti - neutrino extra - galactic flux@xcite @xmath102 if `` unknown source '' of protons is taken into account , the low energy neutrino flux can be raised as @xmath103$]@xcite . however , the neutrino flux at the energies below about @xmath104 is bounded by amanda experiment@xcite , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "we refer to the maximal value of flux ( [ wb1 ] ) as ` wb1 ' flux , while the flux raised at low energies and bounded by amanda experiment below @xmath104 as the ` wb2 ' flux .",
    "the wb bound holds for the optically thin neutrino sources .",
    "mannheim , protheroe and rache ( mpr ) extend the calculation to `` optically thick '' sources to the nucleons@xcite .",
    "they give an upper bound of diffuse neutrino flux which is almost 30 times larger than the wb1 limit in eq .",
    "( [ wb1 ] ) .",
    "when the extra - galactic neutrinos propagate to the earth , we expect they contain the three flavor neutrinos in ratio of 1:1:1 due to the neutrino oscillation",
    ". the supersymmetric particle production rate should be independent of the neutrino flavor since we take all the sleptons almost degenerate .",
    "therefore the three flavors of neutrinos should contribute with the same signal rate , except that @xmath106 has more strongly scattering effect with the earth electron .",
    "here , we calculate the supersymmetric particle signals at the detector contributed by the @xmath107 flux with wb1 , wb2 and mpr limit .       the path of neutrino flux penetrates the earth to the detector at the angle @xmath108 . ]",
    "the earth becomes opaque for neutrinos above about @xmath109 from the nadir due to the charged - current interaction between neutrino and nucleon .",
    "therefore the scattering of @xmath110 to @xmath74 has to be taken into account .    in fig .",
    "[ earth ] we show the path of a neutrino flux penetrating the earth before it reaches the detector located at the point @xmath111 .",
    "we assume that the primary flux at the point @xmath112 is @xmath113 , then the flux at the point @xmath114 is given by @xmath115 where the integration is along the path from the point @xmath112 to @xmath114 , with @xmath116 the nucleon number density , @xmath117 the standard model charged - current cross section and @xmath118 is between @xmath119 and @xmath120 , with @xmath121 km being the radius of the earth .",

    "can reach the detector , we then get the flux of stau at the detector @xmath111 @xmath126 where both integration are along the path and @xmath127 is the supersymmetric cross section . it should be noted that at the point corresponding to @xmath82 there is only one stau finally arriving at the point @xmath111 , while at the point corresponding to @xmath83 , there can be two stau arriving at the point @xmath111 .    at large angles , the range of the stau may be larger than the actual depth of the earth that a neutrino has penetrated . in this case",
    "we take the actual depth the neutrino penetrated to calculate the probability that a stau can be produced by a neutrino .",
    "flux @xmath128 as a function of the incident neutrino energy for wb1 , wb2 and mpr neutrino fluxes and @xmath129 . the flux for the set of soft parameters with @xmath68 is also plotted",
    ". similar quantity for @xmath74 flux is plotted in figure .",

    "for @xmath130 we show the results of wb1 , wb2 and mpr fluxes .",
    "for other parameters we plot only the result of wb1 in the figure for clarity . we notice that the curves become almost flat at the energy above @xmath131 .",
    "the reason is that for the energies above @xmath131 the range of @xmath0 is so large that it is comparable with the radius of the earth .",
    "therefore in most directions the @xmath132 is proportional to the primary neutrino flux according to eq .",
    "( [ tauflux ] ) , i.e. , @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "note that the contribution to the total @xmath0 events comes mainly from the low energy neutrino flux .",
    "( that will be very clear in a @xmath135 figure . )",
    "the reason is that the neutrino flux decreases with energy with the power law index of @xmath136 , while the supersymmetric cross section increases with energy ( well above the threshold ) with a smaller power law index of only about @xmath137 .    the corresponding curves for the @xmath74 flux is also plotted in the figure for the wb1 , wb2 , and mpr neutrino fluxes .",
