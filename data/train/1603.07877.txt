    "in this paper , we analyze the dynamical properties of flows in a @xmath0-neighborhood of the kuperberg flows introduced in @xcite , or to be more precise , of _ generic kuperberg flows _ as introduced in @xcite .",
    "the kuperberg flows are exceptional for the simplicity of their explicit construction in @xcite , and this explicitness makes it a straightforward process to construct 1-parameter families of @xmath8-deformations of a given generic kuperberg flow .",
    "we show in this work that the kuperberg flows are furthermore remarkable , in that there are @xmath0-nearby flows with simple dynamics , and that there are @xmath0-nearby flows with positive topological entropy and an abundance of periodic orbits .",
    "the construction of a kuperberg flow is based on the construction of an aperiodic plug , which we call a _ kuperberg plug _ , and is noted in this paper by @xmath9 .",
    "a plug is a manifold with boundary endowed with a flow , that enables the modification of a given flow inside a flow - box , so that after modification , there are orbits that enter the flow - box and never exit .",
    "moreover , kuperberg s construction does this modification without introducing additional periodic orbits .",
    "expository treatments of kuperberg s construction were given by ghys @xcite and matsumoto @xcite , and in the first chapters of the authors work @xcite .",
    "our work also introduced new concepts for the study of the dynamical properties of the kuperberg flows , which allows one to investigate many further remarkable aspects of these flows .",
    "as a consequence of katok s theorem on @xmath10-flows on @xmath11-manifolds @xcite , the topological entropy of a kuperberg flow is zero . in @xcite",
    "we developed a technique based on the introduction of an `` almost transverse '' rectangle inside the plug and a pseudogroup modeling the return map of the flow to the rectangle , to make an explicit computation of the topological entropy .",
    "this computation revealed chaotic behavior for the flow , but such that it evolves at a very slow rate , and thus it does not result in positive topological entropy .",
    "we proved that , under some extra hypotheses , such generic kuperberg flows have positive `` slow entropy '' , and that the rates of chaotic behavior grow at a precise subexponential , but non - polynomial rate , as discussed in the proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem  21.10 ) .",
    "the calculation behind the proof of this result suggests that for some kuperberg - like flows near to a generic kuperberg flow , there should be actual chaotic behavior , and also positive entropy .    in this paper",
    "we prove the following two theorems which make these remarks more precise .",
    "[ thm - main1 ] there exists a @xmath0 1-parameter family of plugs @xmath2 for @xmath12 $ ] such that :    1 .",
    "the plug @xmath9 is a kuperberg plug ; 2 .   for @xmath6 ,",
    "the flow in the plug @xmath2 has two periodic orbits that bound an invariant cylinder , and every other orbit belongs to the wandering set , and thus the flow has topological entropy zero .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - main1 ] uses the same technical tools as developed in the previous works @xcite for the study of the dynamics of kuperberg flows , and the result is notable mainly for its contrast with the following result , that a @xmath0-neighborhood of a generic kuperberg flow also contains flows which have exceptionally wild dynamics .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following result :    [ thm - main2 ] there exists a @xmath0 1-parameter family of plugs @xmath2 for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , such that :    1 .",
    "the plug @xmath9 is a generic kuperberg plug ; 2 .   for @xmath15 , the flow in @xmath2 has positive topological entropy , and an abundance of periodic orbits .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm - main2 ] is based on the understanding of the dynamics of standard kuperberg flows developed in @xcite , and in particular uses in a fundamental way the technique of relating the dynamics of a kuperberg - like flow to the dynamics of its return map to an almost transverse rectangle .",
    "the construction of the plugs @xmath2 in the proofs of both theorems  [ thm - main1 ] and [ thm - main2 ] follows closely the original construction by k. kuperberg in @xcite , which begins with a modified version of the original wilson plug @xcite , where the modification given in section  [ subsec - wilson ] removes the stable periodic orbits for the flow and replaces them with unstable periodic orbits .",
    "the construction of the 1-parameter family of plugs is described in the first part of this work , section  [ subsec - kuperberg ] , and closely follows the construction in @xcite .",
    "the _ radius inequality _ is the main condition in kuperberg s construction that is used to prove that the flow is aperiodic .",
    "the only change in the requirements of the construction of the flows @xmath16 which we study , is that the radius inequality gets replaced for @xmath17 with the _ parametrized radius inequality _ , as stated in section  [ subsec - kuperberg ] . for @xmath18 we recover the original radius inequality for kuperberg flows .",
    "section  [ sec - radiuslevel ] introduces some of the main tools for the study of the dynamics of kuperberg flows , the radius and level functions , and also gives some of the immediate consequences for the study of the dynamics that are independent of the value of @xmath19 in the parametrized radius inequality .",
    "as we mentioned above , one of the main techniques in @xcite is to introduce a pseudogroup modeling the dynamics of the kuperberg flow .",
    "the other main technique is the study of surfaces tangent to the flow , known as propellers , that were used to describe the topological properties of the minimal set of a generic kuperberg flow .",
    "these surfaces are introduced here in section  [ sec - propeller ] .    the plugs @xmath2 for @xmath6 have rather simple dynamical properties , as stated in theorem  [ thm - main1 ] and described in section  [ sec - enegative ] .",
    "the study of these flows does not requires any extra hypothesis in the constructions .    on the other hand , the study of the dynamical properties of plugs @xmath2 which satisfy the parametrized radius inequality for @xmath20 is extraordinarily complicated . the detailed analysis in @xcite of the standard kuperberg flows required the introduction of the _ generic hypothesis _ in that work ( see hypothesis  [ hyp - sri ] below ) , in order to deduce a wide range of properties for the flows . for the case when @xmath21 , many of the corresponding results do not hold , so we consider in this work only the question of the existence of compact invariant sets for the flows , such that the restricted dynamics of the flow admits a `` horseshoe '' in its transversal model .",
    "even with this more restricted goal , it is still necessary to impose geometric hypothesis on the construction as stated in hypotheses  [ hyp - monotone ] and [ hyp - offset ] , in order to obtain the proof of theorem  [ thm - main2 ] .",
    "the construction of the pseudogroup acting on an almost transverse rectangle @xmath22 is done in section  [ sec - pseudogroups ] . instead of introducing a pseudogroup analogous to the one in chapter 9 of @xcite",
    ", we introduce the simplest pseudogroup that allows us to prove theorem  [ thm - main2 ] .",
    "section  [ sec - horseshoe ] is dedicated to the proof that this pseudogroup contains `` horseshoe maps '' , and the proof introduces surfaces analogous to the propellers introduced in @xcite which are used to define these maps . in section  [ sec - entropy ] we describe the situation in which these horseshoe maps can be embedded in the flow @xmath16 , so that they generate positive entropy for the flow , and not just for the pseudogroup .",
    "then in section  [ subsec - admissible ] , we discuss the construction of examples of @xmath0-deformations of a generic kuperberg flow , such that the hypotheses of theorem  [ thm - entropypositive ] are satisfied , completing the proof of theorem  [ thm - main2 ] .",
    "the results in this paper are inspired by the work in the paper @xcite , and for the sake of brevity , we are forced to refer occasionally to results in @xcite . however , the novel results used in the proof of theorems  [ thm - main1 ] and [ thm - main2 ] are explained and proved here .",
    "further questions and open problems concerning the dynamical properties of the many variations of kuperberg flows are discussed in the paper @xcite .",
    "in this section , we present the construction of the 1-parameter family of plugs @xmath2 for @xmath3 , and introduce some of the techniques used for the study of their dynamical properties .",
    "this follows closely the outline of the construction and study of the usual kuperberg flows in chapters @xmath23 and @xmath11 of @xcite .    in section  [ subsec - wilson ]",
    "we give the construction of the modified wilson plug as introduced by kuperberg in @xcite .",
    "the family of plugs is constructed in section  [ subsec - kuperberg ] , and the parametrized radius inequality is introduced .      a @xmath11-dimensional plug is a manifold @xmath24 endowed with a vector field @xmath25 satisfying the following `` plug conditions '' .",
    "the 3-manifold @xmath24 is of the form @xmath26 $ ] , where @xmath27 is a compact 2-manifold with boundary @xmath28 .",
    "set @xmath29 \\quad , \\quad \\partial_h^- p = d \\times \\{-2\\ } \\quad , \\quad \\partial_h^+ p = d \\times \\{2\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] then the boundary of @xmath24 has a decomposition @xmath30 let @xmath31 be the _ vertical _ vector field on @xmath24 , where @xmath32 is the coordinate of the interval @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the vector field @xmath25 must satisfy the conditions :    * _ vertical at the boundary _ :",
    "@xmath34 in a neighborhood of @xmath35 ; thus , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the entry and exit regions of @xmath24 for the flow of @xmath25 , respectively ; * _ entry - exit condition _ : if a point @xmath38 is in the same trajectory as @xmath39 , then @xmath40 .",
    "that is , an orbit that traverses @xmath24 , exits just in front of its entry point ; * _ trapped orbit _ :",
    "there is at least one entry point whose entire _ forward _ orbit is contained in @xmath24 ; we will say that its orbit is _ trapped _ by @xmath24 ; * _ tame _ : there is an embedding @xmath41 that preserves the vertical direction .",
    "note that conditions ( p2 ) and ( p3 ) imply that if the forward orbit of a point @xmath38 is trapped , then the backward orbit of @xmath42 is also trapped .",
    "a _ semi - plug _ is a manifold @xmath24 endowed with a vector field @xmath25 as above , satisfying conditions ( p1 ) , ( p3 ) and ( p4 ) , but not necessarily ( p2 ) .",
    "the concatenation of a semi - plug with an inverted copy of it , that is a copy where the direction of the flow is inverted , is then a plug .",
    "note that condition ( p4 ) implies that given any open ball @xmath43 with @xmath21 , there exists a modified embedding @xmath44 which preserves the vertical direction again .",
    "thus , a plug can be used to change a vector field @xmath45 on any @xmath11-manifold @xmath46 inside a flowbox , as follows .",
    "let @xmath47 be a coordinate chart which maps the vector field @xmath45 on @xmath46 to the vertical vector field @xmath31 .",
    "choose a modified embedding @xmath48 , and then replace the flow @xmath31 in the interior of @xmath49 with the image of @xmath25 .",
    "this results in a flow @xmath50 on @xmath46 .",
    "the entry - exit condition implies that a periodic orbit of @xmath45 which meets @xmath51 in a non - trapped point , will remain periodic after this modification .",
    "an orbit of @xmath45 which meets @xmath51 in a trapped point never exits the plug @xmath24 , hence after modification , limits to a closed invariant set contained in @xmath24 .",
    "a closed invariant set contains a minimal set for the flow , and thus , a plug serves as a device to insert a minimal set into a flow .",
    "we next introduce the `` modified wilson plug '' , which was the starting point of kuperberg s construction of her plug .",
    "we add to the construction one hypothesis that seems to be implicitly assumed by certain conclusions stated in @xcite , and that are part of the generic hypothesis used in @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is not needed to construct kuperberg s aperiodic plug , but it seems necessary in order to prove the results in this paper .",
    "consider the rectangle , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : wilson1 ] , @xmath53\\times[-2,2 ] = \\{(r , z ) \\mid 1 \\leq r \\leq 3 ~ \\",

    "we may take @xmath62 for example .",

    "[ hyp - genericw ] we require the function @xmath63 satisfy the above conditions , and in addition : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is sufficiently small , as will be specified later in section  [ subsec - kuperberg ] .",
    "in addition , we also require that @xmath66 is monotone increasing as a function of the distance @xmath67 from the special points where it vanishes , and that @xmath63 is non - degenerate .",
    "non - degenerate means that the matrix of second partial derivatives at each vanishing point is invertible .",

    "note that the conclusions of theorem  [ thm - horseshoe ] apply to the map @xmath1019 for any choice of @xmath811 , and for each such flow the set @xmath1237 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : positive1 ] .",

    "suppose that we are given a standard kuperberg flow @xmath1243 on @xmath1 constructed starting with a wilson flow @xmath91 on the wilson plug @xmath52 which satisfies hypothesis  [ hyp - genericw ] , and that the construction of the flow @xmath738 on @xmath1 satisfies the conditions ( k1 ) to ( k8 ) in section  [ subsec - kuperberg ] , and the _ strong radius inequality _ in hypotheses  [ hyp - sri ] for @xmath1244 .",

    "the construction of the flows @xmath16 uses a two - step process . in the first step",

    "this yields the embedding @xmath1258 for which @xmath1251 is @xmath92-flow of the lower intersection point defined in .",
    "intuitively , the value of @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath1259 as the graph of @xmath1255 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : modifiedradius](c ) is quadratic .",
    "this yields our family of insertion maps @xmath290 .",
    "the smooth family of second insertion maps @xmath1260 can then be defined similarly .",
    "however , we now point out that in the proof of theorem  [ thm - entropypositive ] , and its preparatory results , the role of the second insertion only arises in one manner .",
    "we require that the entry / exit condition for orbits of @xmath199 entering a face of the second insertion be satisfied for points @xmath1261 when @xmath1262 .",
    "in particular , this condition will be satisfied if the insertion @xmath1263 is the given map for the construction of the flow @xmath649 , which satisfies the original radius inequality , and thus as noted previously , has corresponding value of @xmath949 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the claim of theorem  [ thm - entropypositive ] , it is not even necessary to modify the upper insertion .",
    "thus , we obtain a smooth family of deformations of @xmath738 where each map @xmath16 satisfies the hypotheses of theorem  [ thm - entropypositive ] , and hence has positive entropy with infinitely many periodic orbits , as asserted in theorem  [ thm - main2 ] ."
