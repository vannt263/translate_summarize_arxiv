    "two conceptual pictures of galaxy clustering have been examined in the literature , the continuous hierarchical clustering model and the power - law cluster model ( peebles 1980 ,  61 ) . in the hierarchical clustering model , which has emerged as the accepted model over the past two decades ,",
    "galaxy clustering is characterized by power - law correlation functions : the @xmath3-point correlation function @xmath4 scales with configuration size as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and the two - point correlation function goes as @xmath7 .",
    "the hierarchical model is motivated by the observed power - law behavior @xmath8 of galaxy correlations ( groth & peebles 1977 ; fry & peebles 1978 ) , with a theoretical basis in a self - similar , scale - invariant solution to the equations of motion ( davis & peebles 1977 ) .",
    "the alternative power - law cluster model has an even longer history ( neyman & scott 1952 ; peebles 1974 , 1980 ; mcclelland & silk 1977 ; scherrer & bertschinger 1991 ; sheth & jain 1997 ; valageas 1998 ; yano & gouda 1999 ) . in this model",
    ", galaxies are placed in spherical clumps that are assumed to follow a power - law density profile @xmath9 , with the centers of the clumps distributed randomly .",
    "the resulting two - point correlation function is also a power law with a logarithmic slope @xmath10 .",
    "while it is possible to reproduce the observed two - point function by an appropriate choice of the power index @xmath11 , peebles and groth ( 1975 ) pointed out that this model produces a three - point function that is too steep to be consistent with observations in the zwicky and lick catalogs .    in an earlier paper ( ma & fry 2000a ) , we have shown that in the nonlinear regime , the three - point correlation function @xmath12 of the cosmological mass density field does not exactly follow the prediction @xmath13 of the hierarchical clustering model .",
    "these conclusions are drawn from study of high resolution numerical simulations of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with cosmological constant and of a model with scale - free initial conditions @xmath14 with @xmath2 . in experiments replacing simulation dark matter halos with power - law density profiles , @xmath15",
    ", we have demonstrated that the behavior of the correlation functions in the nonlinear regime are determined by the halo profiles , but that it is not possible to match both the two- and three - point correlations with a single slope @xmath16 .",
    "these results differ from the predictions of both of these two conceptual models .    in this paper , we expand our previous study of the nonlinear two- and three - point correlation functions by investigating a new prescription that takes into account the non - power - law profiles of halos , the distribution of halo masses , and the spatial correlations of halo centers .",
    "each of these ingredients has been well studied in the literature .",
    "we find that this halo model provides a good description of the two- and three - point correlation functions in both the @xmath2 and cdm simulations over the entire range of scales from the weak clustering , perturbative regime on large length scales , to the strongly nonlinear regime on small length scales .",
    "our result is approximately hierarchical over an intermediate range of scales , thus uniting the two pictures .",
    "an independent recent study by seljak ( 2000 ) , which appeared during completion of this work , has also examined the two - point power spectrum in a similar construction and has found that this type of approach can reproduce the power spectrum in the cdm model . the analytic model proposed here",
    "can be used to compute the two- and three - point correlation functions and their fourier transforms , the power spectrum and bispectrum , over any range of scale where the input halo properties are valid .    in a subsequent paper ( ma & fry 2000c )",
    ", we study the predictions of this analytic halo model for the asymptotic nonlinear behavior of the @xmath3-point correlation functions and the pairwise velocities and examine the conditions required for stable clustering .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the three input ingredients of the model : halo density profiles , halo mass functions , and halo - halo correlations . in ",
    "3 we assemble these ingredients and construct analytic expressions for the two - point correlation function @xmath17 and the power spectrum @xmath18 . in ",
    "4 we do the same for the three - point correlation function @xmath19 and its fourier transform , the bispectrum @xmath20 . in  5 we test the validity of this new model by comparing its predictions with results from numerical simulations of an @xmath2 scale free model and a low - density cdm model with a cosmological constant ( @xmath21cdm ) .",
    "we also present results of the synthetic halo replacement technique used to enhance the numerical resolution . in  6 we discuss further the physical meanings and implications of the model . in particular , we elaborate on two important implications of this model : deviations from the common assumptions of stable clustering and hierarchical clustering .",
    "section  7 is a summary .",
    "it has been suggested recently that the mass density profiles of cold dark matter halos have a roughly universal shape , generally independent of cosmological parameters ( navarro , frenk , & white 1996 , 1997 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionless density amplitude , @xmath24 is a characteristic radius , and @xmath25 is the mean background density .",
    "we consider two functional forms for the density profiles @xmath26 both forms have asymptotic behaviors @xmath27 at small @xmath28 and @xmath29 at large @xmath28 , but they differ in the transition region . the first form @xmath30 with @xmath31 is found to provide a good fit to simulation halos by navarro et al .",

    "( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "some independent simulations have produced halos that are well fit by the shallower @xmath31 inner slope ( e.g. , hernquist 1990 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; huss , jain , & steinmetz 1999 ) , and others the steeper @xmath34 slope ( e.g. , fukushige and makino 1997 ) .",
    "jing & suto ( 2000 ) have recently reported a mass - dependent inner slope , with @xmath35 for galactic - mass halos and @xmath36 for cluster - mass halos .",
    "many of these authors find that the outer profile scales as @xmath37 , but steeper outer profiles have also been suggested ( hernquist 1990 ; dubinski & carlberg 1991 ) . given these uncertainties , we will consider in this paper both types of profiles in .    the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath23 in equation  ( [ shape ] ) are generally functions of the halo mass @xmath38 .",

    "( 1997 ) and cole & lacey ( 1996 ) are also only marginally consistent with each other . a more detailed investigation of the different forms of @xmath126 can be found in ma & fry ( 2000c ) .    in figures 1 and 2 , the agreement at low values of @xmath93 between the original and synthetic halos is excellent , confirming that the correlation functions on larger length scales are insensitive to the spatial distribution of particles in the halo cores .",
    "the only significant difference between the simulation and synthetic halos appears at small length scales , where the coarser resolution of the simulation blurs out the structure of the inner halo and results in an inner profile flatter than in equation  ( [ u ] ) .",
    "this effect is manifested in the bending over of the dashed curves for @xmath18 in figures 1 and 2 at high @xmath93 , and is corrected for when the synthetic halos are used .",
    "we now proceed to compare the predictions of the analytic model of  2   4 with the numerical results from cosmological simulations .",
    "figures  3 and 4 show the @xmath93-space density variance @xmath175 ( upper panel ) and the three - point amplitude @xmath176 for equilateral triangles for the @xmath2 scale - free model and the @xmath21cdm model .",
    "the solid black curves are the model predictions computed from equations  ( [ pk ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) .",
    "the contribution from the single - halo and multiple - halo terms are shown separately as dashed curves . for the density profile ,",
    "we use the same @xmath170 and concentration parameters as in figures  1 and 2 .",
    "for the mass function , we use the press - schechter formula but reduce its overall amplitude by 25% , which we find necessary in order to match the halo mass functions for our numerical simulations .",
    "this overestimation of halo numbers with @xmath177 by press - schechter is a well known result reported in many other studies ( see jenkins et al . 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "the mass limits for the integrals in equations  ( [ pk ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) do not significantly affect the model predictions for the total @xmath164 or @xmath1 .",
    "raising the lower mass limit does reduce the contribution from lower mass halos and hence lower the high-@xmath93 amplitudes of the multiple halo terms @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 , but these terms make negligible contributions to the total @xmath164 and @xmath1 .    as discussed in  3 and 4 , the nonlinear parts of both the two- and three - point statistics are determined by the dominant 1-halo term because the closely spaced particle pairs and triplets mostly reside in the same halos .",
    "the multiple - halo terms are therefore significant only on larger length scales comparable to the separation between halos . their inclusion ,",
    "however , is necessary for the transition into the linear regime .    for the @xmath2 model in figure  3 ,",
    "we plot the results against the scaled @xmath181 , where @xmath62 characterizes the length scale that is becoming nonlinear and is defined by @xmath182 .",
    "three time outputs are shown , where the expansion factor ( 1 initially ) and @xmath62 ( in units of @xmath183 ) are : @xmath184 , and @xmath185 ( from left to right ) .",
    "for the two - point @xmath166 , the agreement between the model prediction and the simulations is excellent .",
    "the three simulation outputs also overlap well , indicating that self - similarity is obeyed , as reported in jain & bertschinger ( 1998 ) . for the three - point @xmath186 , however , self - similar scaling does not hold as rigorously ( ma & fry 2000a ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the analytic prediction agrees most closely with the earliest output @xmath187 ( green curve ) .",
    "this provides further evidence to the suggestion of ma & fry ( 2000a ) that the later outputs of the @xmath2 simulation may be affected by the finite volume of the simulation box . for the @xmath21cdm model in figure  4",
    ", the analytic model again provides a good match to the @xmath3-body results within the fluctuations among the simulations .",
    "we illustrate the numerical effects due to box sizes by showing results from two runs with volume ( 100 mpc)@xmath159 and ( 640 mpc)@xmath159 .",
    "the model predictions extend well beyond the resolution of the simulations .",
    "the real - space two - point correlation function for the @xmath2 and @xmath21cdm models is shown in figures  5 and 6 .",
    "for the halo model predictions , we have chosen to show only the results for the 1-halo term @xmath112 because this term dominates the interesting nonlinear portion of @xmath97 .",
    "the agreement between the halo model ( dashed curves ) and the simulations ( symbols ) is again excellent . for the 2-halo terms @xmath188",
    ", the computation can be done more easily in @xmath93-space as shown in figures  3 and 4 , so we do not include them here .    for comparison , we plot in figures  36 the results from the commonly used fitting formulas for the nonlinear power spectrum ( hamilton et al . 1991 ; jain et al .",
    "1995 ; peacock & dodds 1996 ; ma 1998 ; ma et al .",
    "while the formulas provide a good approximation to @xmath166 up to @xmath189 for the @xmath2 model and @xmath190 mpc@xmath191 for the @xmath21cdm model , the figures show that significant deviations occur at higher @xmath93 , and the fitting formula and our current model predict different high-@xmath93 slopes for @xmath166 .",
    "since the high-@xmath93 behavior of the fitting formulas has been constructed to obey the stable clustering prediction , this discrepancy has an important implication for the validity of stable clustering , which we discuss briefly in the next section and at length in ma & fry ( 2000c ) .",
    "we have constructed a physical model for the correlation functions of the mass density field in which the correlations are derived from properties of dark matter halos .",
    "we have described in detail the input , construction , and results of this model in  2   5 .",
    "we now examine more closely its physical meanings and implications in three separate regimes .    on scales larger than the size of the largest halo ,",
    "the contributions from separate halos dominate , and ( by design ) the model reproduces the results of perturbation theory . on intermediate scales , @xmath192 , because of the exponential cutoff in the mass function @xmath98 at the high mass end , the contribution to the volume integrals in is dominated by the large-@xmath96 regime where the halo profiles are roughly @xmath37 .",
    "the correlation functions therefore behave approximately as predicted by the power - law model with @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath194 and @xmath195 constant .",
    "this is why @xmath1 exhibits an approximately flat plateau at intermediate @xmath93 in the bottom panels of figures  3 and 4 .",
    "on the smallest and most nonlinear scales , the correlation functions probe the innermost regions of the halos .",
    "intriguingly , the halo model predicts on these scales a behavior that is different from either the frequently - assumed stable clustering result of @xmath196 with @xmath197 ( davis & peebles 1977 ) , or the power - law profile result of @xmath10 .",
    "the implication of departure from stable clustering is significant because all the fitting formulas for the nonlinear @xmath18 in the literature ( see  5.2 ) have been constructed to approach the stable clustering limit at high @xmath93 .",
    "a more detailed study on the criteria for stable clustering in this model is given in a separate paper ( ma & fry 2000c ) .",
    "the origin of the deviation from stable clustering in the model at high-@xmath93 can be understood as follows .",
    "for the two - point function , as @xmath93 becomes large , the one - halo integral @xmath198 in converges before the exponential cutoff , and is dominated by contributions near the mass scale for which @xmath199 .",
    "the behavior now depends on the mass distribution function .",
    "the various mass functions discussed in  2.2 have the same general behavior of @xmath200 , where @xmath201 .",
    "the press - schechter form assumes @xmath202 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ ps ] ] ) , while others ( e.g. , sheth & tormen 1999 ; jenkins et al . 2000 ) suggest a flatter slope of @xmath203 for the lower mass halos .",
    "since the scale radius @xmath24 depends on mass as @xmath204 , and @xmath205 ( up to logarithmic factors ) , we find from that the power spectrum at high @xmath93 goes as @xmath206 changing variables to @xmath207 , we see that @xmath208 where the first term in @xmath209 is the prediction of stable clustering .",
    "the departure arises from the factor @xmath210 in the mass function , and would vanish only if @xmath211 or @xmath212 .",
    "this is the origin of the difference in @xmath166 at high @xmath93 between the model prediction ( solid curves ) and the fitting formula ( dotted curves ) shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "for the three - point function , the one - halo integral @xmath213 in converges ( barely , for @xmath214 and @xmath215 ) , giving @xmath216 this again disagrees with the prediction of stable clustering that @xmath1 is constant , but it appears to be consistent with numerical simulations as shown in figures  3 and 4 .    for yet higher order correlations , details of",
    "the halo profile begin to matter . for @xmath31 ,",
    "the pattern of equations ( [ g2halo ] ) and ( [ g3halo ] ) persists to all orders , but for @xmath214 they apply only for the two- and three - point functions ; for four - point and higher functions the nonlinear scale @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 .",
    "thus there seems to be some potentially interesting behavior that is tested only in the four - point function and higher .",
    "we have presented an analytic model for the two- and three - point correlation functions @xmath17 and @xmath19 of the cosmological mass density field and their fourier transforms , the mass power spectrum @xmath18 and the bispectrum @xmath20 . in this model ,",
    "the clustering statistics of the density field are derived from a superposition of dark matter halos with a given set of input halo properties .",
    "these input ingredients include realistic halo density profiles of , halo mass distribution of , and halo - halo spatial correlations of equations  ( [ pbias ] ) and ( [ bbias2 ] ) .",
    "the main results of the model are given by equations  ( [ xi2 ] ) and ( [ pk ] ) for the two - point statistics @xmath97 and @xmath0 , and by equations  ( [ zeta_123 ] ) and ( [ bk ] ) for the three - point statistics @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "this model provides a rapid way to compute the correlation functions over all length scales where the model inputs are valid ; it also gives a physical interpretation of the clustering process of matter in the universe .",
    "we have tested the validity of this model by comparing its predictions with results from cosmological simulations of an @xmath2 scale - free model and a @xmath21cdm model . as",
    "figures  3  6 illustrate , the model describes well the simulation results spanning the entire range of behavior from the perturbative regime on large scales to the strongly nonlinear regime on small scales . to probe the critical high-@xmath93 range in the deeply nonlinear regime ,",
    "we have used a halo replacement technique to increase the resolution of the large parent simulations . as",
    "figures  1 and 2 illustrate , this method of replacing the original halos that suffer from numerically softened cores with synthetic halos of analytic profiles is a reasonable way to improve the resolution of numerical simulations . by using density profiles",
    "obtained empirically from higher - resolution simulations of individual halos , this recipe allows us to model accurately the inner regions of the halos on scales below the numerical softening length scale , while at the same time preserving all the large - scale information available in the large parent simulation .",
    "this technique should also be useful for other studies that depend on the inner halo density profiles , for example , the ray - tracing method in gravitational lensing .    given that dark matter halos in simulations ( and presumably in nature ) are not perfectly spherical , cleanly delineated objects , it is intriguing that the model constructed in this paper works as well as it does at matching the simulation results",
    ". nevertheless , this analytic model provides a good qualitative and quantitative description over the entire range of scales covered by the simulation , and it can be used to make predictions beyond these scales .",
    "this is the first model prescription that successfully reproduces both two- and three - point mass correlations .",
    "we believe that it will prove to be a generally useful framework .",
